1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International NV submitted on 15 February 2021 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, 
through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 
28 July 2020. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is indicated for active 
immunisation for the prevention of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in adults greater than or 
equal to 18 years of age. The use of the vaccine should be in accordance with official 
recommendations.’ 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0059/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0059/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned regulation. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance adenovirus type 26 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

Compliance with Scientific Advice 
In general, the applicant has taken into account the advice and comments provided by the CHMP on 
the quality-related issues. More particularly, the control strategy and specifications proposed by the 
applicant in the MAA are largely in line with the recommendations provided.  
Regarding the pre-clinical development, points raised were the use of platform data to support clinical 
development in the absence of studies with an insert-specific vector, timing of Ad26.COV2.S repeat-
dose toxicity study, design and timing of EFD-PPND study, nonclinical pharmacology package to 
support clinical development at different stages, and platform data on biodistribution to support MA in 
the absence of insert-specific data. The submitted data are not in conflict with the provided advice.

2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020 the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally 
and on 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to 
control the outbreak.  
According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung 
injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 01 March 2021, there have been over 113 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with approximately 2.5 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19). The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease with full 
recovery.   
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities.  
Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to COVID-19. European 
countries that have established surveillance systems in long-term care facilities (LTCF) have reported 
that 5-6% of all current LTCF residents died of COVID-19, and that LTCF residents accounted for up to 
72% of all COVID-19 related deaths. 
Individuals with high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to occupation include healthcare and 
frontline workers. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 15/218 
 
 
 
 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity 
and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and 
fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit 
facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits 
an immune response that prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median 
incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, 
resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically 
recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to 
recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to 
eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the 
hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU.  
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which 
may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.  
Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and 
statins, targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. 
remdesivir), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 16/218 
 
 
 
These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with 
different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease.  
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an 
urgent and unmet medical need for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 infections during 
the ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the 
pandemic on a population level are desired. Although three vaccines for prevention of COVID-19 were 
approved recently, there is still an important need for additional vaccines to meet global demands. 
About the product 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (also referred to as Ad26.COV2.S) is a monovalent, recombinant, 
replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vectored vaccine encoding a severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) spike (S) protein.  
Wild-type adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) consists of non-enveloped virions, which encode the 
adenoviral proteins. The dsDNA molecule is encapsulated by an icosahedral protein structure.  
The recombinant Ad26 vector Ad26.COV2.S contains a transgene which encodes a modified full-length 
SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with stabilizing modifications, i.e. 2 amino acid changes in the S1/S2 
junction that knock out the furin cleavage site, and 2 proline substitutions in the hinge region.  
Following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, the spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV 2 is expressed, 
stimulating an adaptive humoral and cellular immune response. 
Ad26.COV2.S is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.5 mL (5x1010 vp, corresponding to 
not less than 8.92 log10 infectious units). 
Proposed indication: ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention 
of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. 
The use of the vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.’ 
The same Adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector encoding the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus Zaire 
(ZEBOV) Mayinga strain has been approved in Europe through Centralised Procedure (Zabdeno, INN: 
ebola vaccine  rDNA, replication-incompetent; Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/005337/0000).  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, based on the following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
According to the applicant, the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data presented in their application 
support a favourable benefit-risk profile for Ad26.COV2.S in the proposed cMA indication, i.e. for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adults ≥18 years of age.  
This is based on evidence from the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study COV3001 which examines the 
efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S in a diverse adult population ≥18 
years of age, including adults ≥60 years of age. The applicant stated that the results for the primary 
analysis, performed after at least 2 months (8 weeks) of follow-up indicate that Ad26.COV2.S is 
effective against symptomatic COVID-19 and both co-primary endpoints of the study were met. 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) (adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI]) for the co-primary endpoints against 
molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 in participants who were seronegative at 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

the time of vaccination was 66.9% (59.03; 73.40) when considering cases with onset at least 14 days 
after vaccination and 66.1% (55.01; 74.80) when considering cases with onset at least 28 days after 
vaccination, with consistent efficacy across age groups. 
In addition, the applicant stated that Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in the prevention of 
severe/critical COVID-19, particularly in prevention of hospitalisation and death, across all countries 
and all ages. Vaccine efficacy (adjusted 95% CI) against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID-
19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccination was 76.7% (54.56; 89.09) and increased to 85.4% 
(54.15; 96.90) at least 28 days after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 related 
hospitalisation (including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and ECMO) was 93.1% (95% CI: 
72.74; 99.20) at least 14 days after vaccination and was 100.0% (95% CI: 74.26; 100.0) at least 28 
days after vaccination.  
Finally, according to the applicant, there were no COVID-19-related deaths reported in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 5 COVID-19-related deaths reported in the placebo group. 
Ad26.COV2.S, given as a single dose, is found to have an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile 
in adults ≥18 years of age and did not raise safety concerns in any of the assessed populations that 
are reflective of the target groups for vaccination, including adults ≥60 years of age and adults with 
comorbidities (including comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progressing to severe/critical 
COVID-19). 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant intends to provide a comprehensive post-marketing plan which is proposed to generate 
additional data on long-term follow-up and in populations not yet studied. These data will be submitted 
as they become available. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed. 
According to the applicant, despite 3 vaccines approved in the EU, the need for additional vaccines 
remains high in the EU and globally as the virus continues to spread, with highly transmissible variants 
continuing to emerge around the globe. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate, being single-dose, 
easily transportable and stored, and compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels could aid 
to the further enhancement of the response, to control this pandemic. In addition, Ad26.COV2.S is 
highly effective in the prevention of severe/critical COVID-19 caused by newly emerging strains, such 
as the 20H/501Y.V2 strain first observed in South Africa and the P.2 variant first observed in Brazil. 
This finding is especially reassuring since it can be expected that more variants will occur over time. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
According to the applicant, a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is effective against all symptomatic COVID-
19. Use of this vaccine could help to control the pandemic, to reduce the burden of disease and relieve 
pressure on the health care infrastructure, in view if its high efficacy in prevention of severe/critical 
COVID-19, especially hospitalisation and death. In addition, the favourable storage conditions and 
single dose regimen will simplify deployment of vaccination.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a multidose suspension for injection containing not less than 
8.92 log10  Inf.U (infectious units) per 0.5 mL dose, of Ad26.COV2-S (recombinant), the adenovirus type 
26 vector encoding the SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein, as active substance (AS).  
Other  ingredients  are:  2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin  (HBCD),  citric  acid  monohydrate,  ethanol, 
hydrochloric acid, polysorbate-80, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, trisodium citrate dihydrate and 
water for injections. 
The product is available in a 2.5 mL multidose vial presentation (5 doses) in a 10-vial pack. The type I 
glass  vials  have  a  chlorobutyl  stopper  with  fluoropolymer  coated  surface,  aluminium  crimp  and  blue 
plastic cap.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The active substance, Ad26.COV2.S, is a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 
(Ad26) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. 
Wild type adenovirus type 26 consists of non-enveloped virions, between 80 and 100 nm in diameter, 
each containing a single linear molecule of dsDNA of approximately 35 kbp which encode the adenoviral 
proteins.  The  dsDNA  molecule  is  encapsulated  by  an  icosahedral  protein  structure  consisting  of  the 
structural proteins II (hexon), III (penton), IV (fibre), VI, VIII, IX, and IIIa. Core proteins V, VII, and X 
and the terminal protein are directly associated with the DNA molecule. The virus structure is shown in 
Figure 1.  
The  recombinant  Ad26  vector,  Ad26.COV2.S,  is  replication  incompetent  after  administration  due  to 
deletions  in  the  E1  gene  (ΔE1A/E1B).  The  E1  deletion  renders  the  vector  replication-incompetent  in 
noncomplementing cells such as human cells. In Ad5 E1 complementing cell lines (e.g., HEK293, PER.C6 
TetR and HER96 cells lines) the virus can be propagated. In addition, a part of the E3 gene region has 
been removed (ΔE3) to create sufficient space in the viral genome for insertion of foreign antigens and 
the  Ad26  E4  orf6  has  been  exchanged  by  the  Ad5  homologue  to  allow  production  of  replication-
incompetent Ad26 vectors in Ad5 E1 complementing cell lines. 
The Ad26.COV2.S vector contains a transgene in the ΔE1A/E1B region which encodes a modified full-
length  SARS-CoV-2  spike  protein  with  stabilizing  modifications  (Figure  2).  The  wild-type  full-length  S 
gene information (NCBI reference: YP_009724390.1) was obtained from a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. 
During production of the recombinant vector the expression of the S antigen is silenced by the producing 
cell  line  (PER.C6  TetR  cells).  After  administration  of  the  vaccine,  the  S  antigen  will  be  expressed  in 
humans which will lead to an immune response.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The AS is manufactured by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL), Janssen Biologics B.V. 
(Leiden, NL), and Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC (Baltimore, USA). 
A Major objection was raised during the procedure for the absence of certificates of GMP compliance for 
Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) and Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC (Baltimore, 
USA).  The  certificates  have  now  been  issued  and  the  major  objection  resolved.  All  relevant  active 
substance sites have valid manufacturing authorisations or valid GMP certificates as appropriate.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The AS manufacturing process consists of ten stages: 1) pre-culture 2) cell expansion 3) virus production 
4) lysis 5) DNA precipitation; 6) clarification 7) anion exchange chromatography (AEX) chromatography 
8) polishing and buffer exchange 9) final adjustment and fill and finally 10) freezing of the AS.  
Each preculture train (from large volume high density (LVHD) bag thaw through 10 L wave-mixed culture 
used for inoculation of stage 2) originates from a single LVHD bag and is used to produce one batch of 
AS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 20/218 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All steps of the AS manufacturing process are described in detail. The process starts with thawing of a 
vial  of  the  cell  substrate.  Cells  are  expanded  and  then  inoculated  with  the  recombinant  adenoviral 
construct. After virus production the cells are lysed and virus is collected. Purification steps include a 
DNA  precipitation  step,  a  clarification,  an  anion  exchange  chromatography  step  and  diafiltration.  The 
diafiltered product is then formulated and undergoes a 0.2 µm filtration before filling in polycarbonate 
bottles. No reprocessing is claimed. The active substance is stored below -40°C.  
As regards the control strategy, the manufacturing process is controlled using process parameters and 
in-process  controls.  Critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  have  been  provided  for  the  AS  manufacturing 
process  which  has  been  verified  during  AS  process  performance  qualification  (PPQ).  The  proposed 
operating ranges for the CPPs are acceptable. 
Both a small scale process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL), and a large scale process, 
at Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) and at Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC (USA), 
are included in the marketing authorisation application. The small scale process will be used for the initial 
commercial AS batches. Both small and large scale processes use tiered virus seed systems (including 
master virus seed (MVS), working virus seed (WVS) and inoculum). All virus seed material originates 
from the same MVS batch. 
Quality of process intermediates is adequately controlled by in-process controls. Any excursion outside 
of  the  defined  ranges  (action  limits)  will  be  investigated.  A  distinction  is  made  between  in-process 
controls (IPC) with strict acceptance criteria and IPC with predefined instructions. IPC results have to 
comply  with  acceptance  criteria.  The  methods  used  for  IPC  and  the  method  qualifications  have  been 
described. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  performed  in  a  production  facility  at  controlled  room  temperature. 
Maximum process durations and processing temperatures are defined. The combination of hold time(s) 
and processing time(s) should not exceed the maximum process duration. Upon request, the applicant 
provided data for lifetime and sanitisation procedures for the anion exchange chromatography material.  
See Figure 3 for a flowchart of the AS manufacturing process.

Control of materials 
Raw materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted.  All  materials  have  been  described  in  detail.  Compendial  raw  materials  are  tested  in 
accordance  with  the  corresponding  monograph.  For  non-compendial  raw  materials,  adequate 
specifications  are  in  place  to  control  their  quality.  Composition  of  media  has  been  provided.  No  raw 
materials of human or animal origin are used in the AS manufacturing process.  
During establishment of the virus seed, bovine serum has been used which was compliant to the effective 
version of EMA/410/01 (European Commission: Note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting 
animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products), and thus does 
not  pose  any  risk  for  transmission  of  transmissible  spongiform  encephalopathies/bovine  spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSE/BSE). 
Benzonase, which is used during AS manufacturing, is produced in bacteria. The fermentation medium 
contains  casein  hydrolysate  that  is  produced  from  bovine  milk  sourced  from  healthy  animals  from 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 22/218 
 
 
 
 
 
Australia  and  New  Zealand.  The  material  complies  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  EMEA/410/01  Rev.  3 
(TSE). Casein hydrolysate is sterile filtered before its introduction into the fermentation medium. The 
latter itself is sterilised additionally in the fermenter at 121°C, 1 bar for 35 min. Accordingly, there are 
no risks with regards to extraneous agents (viral or microbial) contamination. 
Cell bank system 
The PER.C6 cell line is used for virus production. The PER.C6 cell line was derived from human embryonal 
retina  (HER)  cells,  which  were  rendered  immortal  by  transfection  with  the  linearised  pIG.E1A.E1B 
plasmid.  The  construction  of  the  PIG.E1A.E1B  plasmid  was  extensively  described.  The  preparation  of 
both, adherent and suspension PER.C6 cell banks as well as the generation and selection of the PER.C6 
TetR cell line and research cell bank (RCB) are well described. The PER.C6 TetR cell bank system has 
been documented in detail and is in line with ICH Q5D and ICH Q5A (R1). This cell bank was derived to 
optimise production of the recombinant virus. The repressor protein, which is expressed by the PER.C6 
TetR  cells,  blocks  expression  of  the  SARS-Cov-2  transgene  during  production  of  the  recombinant 
adenoviral vector, thereby optimising vector production.  
The cell banking system is a tiered system, including MCB, WCB and LVHD. Information on storage and 
stability testing of cell banks is provided. Extensive testing at different levels (PER.C6 cell bank system 
and PER.C6 tetR cell bank system) has been performed which confirms that the PER.C6 TetR master cell 
bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) have been properly qualified. Testing of cell banks for viral 
and non-viral adventitious agents and screening also for retroviruses has been sufficiently described and 
is acceptable. Tumorigenicity and oncogenicity studies have been performed on the PER.C6 cell line. It 
is accepted that repetition of these studies with the PER.C6 TetR cell line is considered not necessary in 
line with WHO TRS 978 Annex 3 and ICH Q5D. Additional characterisation testing also confirmed correct 
identity and genetic stability of the cell bank system. The applicant also described the manufacturing of 
future WCBs and LVHD cells. The proposed testing programme to qualify future WCBs and LVDH cells is 
deemed adequate. 
Virus seed system  
The  construction  of  the  plasmid  pAd26.E1.CMVdel134-TO.COR200007  has  been  described.  The 
pAd26.E1.CMVdel134-TO.COR200007  is  a  single  genome  plasmid  which  was  used  to  produce  the 
Ad26.COV2.S vector by transfection of this plasmid into PER.C6 TetR cells. To generate the replication 
incompetent Ad26.COV2.S virus, linearised pAd26.E1.CMVdel134-TO.COR200007 was transfected into 
PER.C6 TetR cells from PER.C6 TetR RCB N644-076. Two plaque purifications were performed to ensure 
the single plaque origin of the virus seed stocks. MVS 20E18-04 was prepared by infecting PER.C6 TetR 
cells with pre-MVS E005872. The crude harvest (MVS 20E18-04) has been stored in cryobags in a freezer 
below -65°C. WVS 20E20-05 was prepared by infecting PER.C6 TetR cells with MVS 20E18-04. A new 
WVS 964918 has been prepared for the large scale process. WVS 964918 (large scale) was generated 
from MVS 20E18-04 by first generating Ad26.COV2.S intermediate virus passage (IVP) 20F11-04, which 
was subsequently used to generate WVS 964918. 
Both small and large scale processed uses tiered virus seed systems. All virus seed material originates 
from the same MVS batch. Generation of the recombinant virus and production and testing of the MVS 
and  WVS  has  been  described  in  detail  (identity,  safety  including  testing  for  sterility,  mycoplasma, 
retroviruses for WVS, in vitro adventitious virus assay, replication competent adenovirus (RCA) and viral 
content). The proposed tests are deemed adequate. Specific tests for human viruses, porcine viruses 
and  MMV  were  not  performed  since  no  materials  from  human  or  animal  origin  were  used  during 
generation of the virus seed system (except for irradiated foetal bovine serum). Since bovine serum was 
used during production of the pre-MVS, possible contamination by highly resistant bovine viruses cannot 
be fully excluded. Therefore, the applicant has performed additional screening for bovine viruses. The 
MVS  and  WVS  were  characterised  for  infectivity  titre,  genetic  stability  and  stable  expression  of  the 
Assessment report

transgene. MVS, WVS and AS have identical sequences, demonstrating genetic stability. In addition, AS 
manufactured by the large scale process using inoculum (which includes additional virus passages) had 
identical sequences, confirming genetic stability. Correct expression of the transgene was confirmed.  
The applicant also described the manufacture of future WVS. The proposed testing programme to qualify 
future  WVS  is  deemed  adequate.  The  applicant  confirms  its  commitment  to  implementing  the  3Rs 
principle. The use of in vivo methods to qualify future batches of WCB, LVHD and WVS is not necessary 
since the manufacture of such materials does not represent any contamination risks that are not already 
mitigated. The in vivo testing has been removed as a release requirement for future batches of WVS, 
WCB and LVHD (including testing via end of production cells).  
A summary of the validation of the transport of the cell banks and virus seeds to the manufacturing sites 
has been provided. Transport is properly validated. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The applicant provided an overview of critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process controls (IPC). 
Overall, the control strategy is deemed acceptable. Each IPC is associated with a test method, a sampling 
location  and  an  acceptance  criterion  or  a  predefined  instruction.  IPC  results  comply  with  acceptance 
criteria.  See  manufacturing  process  development  section  for  further  details  of  control  strategy 
development. 
Process validation 
Process  validation  has  a  lifecycle,  starting  with  process  development  followed  by  commercial  scale 
process verification/process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) runs and then continues in the form of 
ongoing  process  verification  throughout  routine  production.  Process  validation  at  commercial  scale  is 
carried out to demonstrate that the process is capable of reproducibly manufacturing product meeting 
quality requirements.  
Based on experience with the Ad26 vaccine platform products, critical quality attributes (CQA), critical 
material attributes (CMA) and CPP have been assigned. The process validation addresses the following: 
validation  of  different  process  steps  (Stages  1-10);  qualification  of  process  intermediate  hold  times; 
control  of  impurities;  consistency  of  DS;  shipping  qualification;  continued  process  verification. 
Furthermore, IPC and release tests were established as part of an initial control strategy. The purpose 
of process validation is to demonstrate that the manufacturing process meets the acceptance criteria for 
IPC, release testing, CPP and CMA. Supporting data to confirm these CPPs and CMAs and to define proven 
acceptable ranges (PAR) are generated during process validation concurrent to Ad26.COV2.S commercial 
manufacturing.  
PPQ data have been provided for the small scale AS process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. 
(Leiden, NL), the large scale AS process at Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) and Emergent Baltimore 
(USA), including data from AS process verification / process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) (process 
parameter results, IPC results, impurity removal, batch data and hold times) confirming the validated 
status of the process at these sites. In addition, process validation for the inoculum performed at Janssen 
Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) was completed through the successful execution of two consecutive PV/PPQ 
batches. Results from the third PPQ lot should be provided post-approval (recommendation 1).  
Two active and passive shipping systems are proposed and have been suitably validated for the transport 
of AS. Qualification data were provided to support the hold times used during AS manufacture. A shipping 
system has been qualified for the transport of inoculum.

Manufacturing process development 
A process control strategy was developed based on extensive AdVac/PER.C6 platform experience and 
following scientific rationale. Potential CQA, preliminary CPP, and preliminary CMA were established and 
controlled by different tests: IPC, release, characterisation and stability. The risk for viral contamination, 
RCA and adventitious agents has been mitigated by performing appropriate testing to starting and raw 
materials in compliance with applicable regulatory guidance documents, together with appropriate IPC 
and release tests. The process used to identify critical quality attributes associated with the AS and FP 
is  sufficiently  described  and  explained.  A  criticality  assessment  was  performed  based  on  the  level  of 
severity and the degree of knowledge uncertainty. The CQA identified by the criticality assessment are 
properly described. A summary of the preliminary CPP and CMA is provided, together with justifications 
for their criticality. 
The history of the process development is summarised. Four process manufacturing variants (S-VAL-1 
to  S-VAL-4)  of  the  AS  manufacturing  process  have  been  used  for  the  small  scale  process  and  three 
additional variants (S-VLF-1, S-VLF-2 and S-EME-1) for the large process. 
The batches that have been produced for clinical development as well as the current inventory of material 
produced  for  commercial  use  were  manufactured  at  the  small  bioreactor  scale  (Janssen  Vaccines  & 
Prevention B.V., Leiden, NL). To ensure sufficient supply for commercial use, the applicant has upscaled 
the process to a bioreactor of large scale at the Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) site and the Emergent 
Baltimore (USA).  
Detailed information has been provided on the equipment used and on the process parameter results 
and IPC results for the 3 clinical lots and the first commercial AS lots of each of the three commercial 
sites. Results were highly similar for all process parameters and IPCs for all AS batches produced thus 
far. 
The essential elements of the AS manufacturing process were retained throughout process development. 
The  AS  manufacturing  process  variant  S-VAL-2/3  did  not  change  with  respect  to  the  manufacturing 
process variant S-VAL-1, apart from two differences. The introduction of an additional virus seed passage 
(AS was manufactured from WVS i.e. additional virus seed passage) was qualified by a comparability 
analysis confirming the absence of any impact on AS quality. Variant S-VAL-1/2/3 were used for Phase 
1/2/3  clinical  trials;  however,  these  3  variants  can  essentially  be  considered  the  same  process.  The 
introduction of a larger AS storage container is also assessed. Some further process optimisations were 
introduced for the S-VAL-4 process used for the small commercial batches. A 2-Tier staggered approach 
has been used to demonstrate comparability between S-VAL-2/3 and S-VAL-4 AS batches. The Tier 1 
contains the release testing results and some important characterisation tests. The Tier 2 part of the 
comparability assessment comprises additional characterisation. Both the results for release tests and 
characterisation  tests  were  highly  similar.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  AS  lots  from  the 
commercial small scale process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL) are comparable to 
the lots used in the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Furthermore, as part of the qualification of the large scale process at the Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, 
NL), a third study was performed to demonstrate comparability between AS from the large scale process 
and the small scale process (Process Variants S-VAL-4, small scale, and S-VLF-1/2, large scale) and was 
also  designed  as  a  2-Tier  staggered  approach.  Comparability  was  demonstrated  based  on  the  tier  1 
comparability  data.  Similarly,  comparability  was  also  demonstrated  between  AS  from  the  Emergent 
(USA) site and AS from the other commercial sites based on tier 1 data. The applicant should provide, 
upon availability, the tier 2 comparability data to confirm that the large scale AS (from Janssen Biologics 
B.V. (Leiden, NL) and from Emergent Baltimore (USA)) is comparable to the small scale process material 
(from Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., Leiden, NL) (recommendations 2 and 3).

Characterisation 
Characterisation studies were conducted using AS batches and FP batches, including clinical trial material 
and commercial use lots, investigating capsid composition, particle heterogeneity, virus DNA, biological 
activity and structure-function relationships.  
The AS has been adequately characterised using a range of biochemical, biophysical and biological state-
of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure. 
In conclusion, the correct expression of adenovirus proteins was confirmed and shown to be consistent. 
In addition, typical adenovirus particle results were obtained upon biophysical characterisation. 
Biological  activity:  Relative  level  of  transgene  expression  was  measured  by  transgene  expression 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TGE-ELISA). Infectivity as determined by quantitative PCR based 
potency assay (QPA) in release testing showed a strong correlation to the TGE-ELISA characterisation 
results, supporting that the transgene expression level is sufficiently controlled by infectivity (QPA) in 
release testing. 
Characterisation  of  virus  DNA  confirmed  the  transgene  identity  and  flanking  regions.  The  genomic 
integrity and stability of Ad26.COV2.S AS was shown upon additional passaging. Furthermore, transgene 
genetic stability analysis confirmed expression of the transgene and phenotypic stability. 
Finally,  structure/function  relationships  were  characterised  using  forced  degradation  studies  which 
indicated  that  the  major  route  of  degradation  of  Ad26.COV2.S  exposed  to  thermal  stress  was  virus 
protein degradation. This degradation led to a linear decrease in potency (on log10 scale) as determined 
by infectivity and relative transgene expression measurements, indicative of a first order degradation. 
Additional characterisation was carried out with the inoculum to determine genetic stability.  
Impurities 
Process-related impurities have been characterised during clinical development of the current product 
and  also  during  previous  studies  performed  for  other  Ad26  viral  vectors  produced  using  the  same 
platform technology. Process-related impurities from the AS manufacturing process include cell culture 
media  components  and  additives,  PER.C6  TetR  host  cell  constituents  and  downstream  buffer 
components. The principles of quality risk management (ICH Q9) were used to identify critical process-
related impurities. 
From  the  assessment  of  81  impurities,  it  was  concluded  that  most  were  non-critical.  Only  2  process-
related impurities were considered critical, host cell DNA and host cell protein (HCP); these are controlled 
via the AS specifications. 
Upon  request,  the  applicant  has  provided  summaries  of  the  impurity  spiking  studies.  The  data 
demonstrate  that  the  chromatography  purification  and  the  various  filtration  steps  result  in  efficient 
removal of impurities. All these impurities are reduced by several log units during purification of AS. The 
level of impurity removal is deemed sufficient. 
The  applicant  has  also  provided  calculations  of  worst-case  situation  levels  of  the  different  impurities 
taking into account the reduction obtained by the purification steps. It was shown that all impurities are 
reduced to sufficiently low levels which do not raise any concerns regarding safety.  
Potential  product-related  impurities  include  empty  or  incomplete  adenovirus  particles,  adenovirus 
aggregates  and  (fragments  of)  adenovirus  proteins,  and  post-translationally  modified  forms  of  the 
adenovirus  protein.  Product-related  impurities,  were  analysed  and  shown  to  be  low  in  quantity  and 
consistent between AS batches (regardless of the DS manufacturing scale, small or large).  
Assessment report

The stated impurities have been present in product used in clinical trials. 
Specification 
The release and stability specifications for Ad26.COV2.S AS comprise appropriate physico-chemical tests 
and tests for identity, purity and potency. 
The specification of Ad26.COV2.S AS consists of the following tests: identity by ID-PCR and virus protein 
fingerprinting by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC); impurities (HCP 
by ELISA and host cell DNA by qPCR); potency (transgene expression by qualitative ELISA, infectious 
units,  ratio  virus  particles/infectious  units);  quantity  (virus  particles  by  VP-qPCR),  safety  (bioburden, 
bacterial  endotoxins,  replication  competent  adenovirus)  and  general  tests  (appearance,  pH  and 
polysorbate 80 concentration).  
The specifications proposed for the AS are deemed acceptable. Upon request during the procedure the 
applicant has included a release test for replication competent adenovirus (RCA) which is considered an 
important safety test for a pandemic vaccine virus and required by the Ph. Eur. 5.14.  
Upon request the HCP acceptance criterion has been further tightened to an acceptable level. In addition, 
the infectivity specification has been increased to maintain alignment with the revised FP specification.  
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines.  Compendial  methods  were  verified  to 
demonstrate  that  the  methods  are  suitable  for  use  with  the  current  product  and  that  no 
interference/inhibition occurs.  
The specification includes tests for both viral particle (VP) concentration and infectious units (Inf.U) to 
measure potency.  
Transgene  expression  is  measured  by  an  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay.  The  qualitative 
procedure to measure transgene expression confirms that cells infected with Ad26.COV2.S express the 
transgene  protein.  Upon  request,  the  applicant  provided  more  information  on  the  source  of  the 
recombinant  fusion  protein,  that  is  used  as  a  primary  antibody  in  the  transgene  expression  assay; 
specificity of this primary antibody has been demonstrated. 
Batch analysis 
Satisfactory batch analysis data and additional characterisation test results are provided for clinical AS 
batches and  small scale commercial batches (including  PPQ lots), all produced at the Janssen Vaccines 
& Prevention B.V. small-scale commercial AS manufacturing site (Leiden, NL), for large scale PPQ batches 
produced at the Janssen Biologics B.V. large scale manufacturing site (Leiden, NL) and for  large scale 
PPQ batches produced at the Emergent Baltimore (USA) site. 
Reference materials 
The same reference standard is used for AS and FP testing. See FP Reference materials section for more 
detailed information. 
Container closure system 
The applicant provided a detailed description of the AS container. An extractables study was performed 
for the AS container. The data from the extractables study results did not indicate any reason of concern. 
The  container  is  stated  to  comply  with  the  European  requirements  on  leachables  and  extractables 
outlined in CPMP/QWP/4359/03. The container closure system for the AS is qualified for product shipping, 
Assessment report

freezing/thawing  and  long-term  storage.  The  integrity  of  the  container  closure  system  is  validated.  A 
risk assessment was performed which confirmed that additional leachables studies are not required for 
the AS container.  
Stability 
A shelf life of AS when the AS is stored frozen was proposed by the applicant. 
The proposed shelf life is supported by long term (below -40°C) and accelerated (2-8°C) stability data 
from other Ad26 viral vectors produced using the same platform technology (> 40 AS lots ranging from 
24 months to 48 months stability). These lots were also stored in the same polycarbonate containers as 
proposed  for  this  product  and  they  were  manufactured  at  the  small  scale  at  Janssen  Vaccine  and 
Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL). Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, 
this approach is deemed acceptable. The AS is typically very stable when stored below -40°C; no trends 
are observed during shelf life. 
The applicant has placed representative AS lots on stability (real time at -60°C and accelerated at 5°C) 
in accordance with applicable ICH guidelines. These include clinical and manufacturing lots manufactured 
at the small scale at the Janssen Vaccine and Prevention B.V. site (Leiden, NL) and large scale lots from 
the Janssen Biologics B.V. site (Leiden, NL). Since the glass transition temperature of the AS is -34°C, 
stability studies at the proposed temperature are appropriate to support the storage conditions. AS lots 
were stored in bottles considered representative of the commercial containers. The proposed stability 
testing programme  is  deemed  acceptable  and includes  appropriate  stability-indicating  parameters.  All 
batches are tested for pH, infectious units, transgene expression, virus particle (vector concentration), 
and ratio VP/ Inf.U at all timepoints.  
Currently 6 months stability data are available for AS lots and 3 months for the small scale commercial 
lot (manufactured at the Janssen Vaccine and Prevention B.V. site) and for one large scale commercial 
lot  (manufactured  at  the  Janssen  Biologics  B.V.  site).  The  AS  stability  studies  will  be  continued  until 
completion at the real-time stability storage condition and at the accelerated stability storage condition. 
The applicant should provide the AS stability data for representative AS batches (from the small scale 
production  site)  when  the  stability  study  has  been  finalised  and  the  results  are  available 
(recommendation 4). Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should 
however be reported to the EMA. In addition to the three representative small scale AS lots, stability 
studies have been initiated with large scale commercial AS batches. Results will be provided when the 
data are available. Finally, the applicant should also initiate stability studies for 3 PPQ AS lots from each 
of the AS manufacturing sites and from future added sites (recommendation 4).  
An appropriate shelf-life of the AS and storage conditions were agreed. Stability-monitoring programs 
for two inoculum batches have also been initiated. A re-test date for inoculum when stored frozen was 
proposed by the applicant. This date will be extended when the stability studies confirm stability.

Formulation development 
The  development  of  the  FP  has  been  described  in  detail.  The  formulation  composition  (excipients, 
concentrations,  pH)  of  Ad26.COV2.S  FP  was  based  on  prior  knowledge  from  formulation  studies  with 
similar adenoviral vector-based products.  
The type of excipients and the quantitative composition of Ad26.COV2.S FP were selected based on early 
formulation development studies. The selection of the formulation composition was based on the results 
of formulation screening and optimisation studies performed for Ad26.COV2.S and representative Ad26 
platform  products  and  parameters  evaluated  comprised  pH,  buffer  type,  various  stabilisers 
(cryoprotectant, antioxidant and surfactant) and tonicifying agents.  
Suitability  of  the  final  selected  formulation  for  Ad26.COV2.S  FP  was  demonstrated  in  product-specific 
studies demonstrating acceptable stability during refrigerated and accelerated storage. The late stage 
Ad26.COV2.S FP development consisted of studies designed to evaluate the stability of the formulation 
during  temperature  cycling,  freeze-thaw  stress,  mechanical  stress  (agitation)  and  thermal  stability  at 
elevated temperatures. The conclusions are based on studies on Ad26.COV2.S and representative Ad26 
platform  products.  Overall,  the  Ad26.COV2.S  data  obtained  in  assessments  covering  the  range  of 
conditions  described  are  in  agreement  with  representative  Ad26  platform  products  data  and  support 
leveraging of platform data. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  Quality  Target  Product  Profile  (QTPP)  is  presented  with  links  to  defined  CQAs.  For  the  CQA 
identification  process,  potentially  relevant  quality  attributes  were  selected  based  on  the  QTPP,  pre-
assessment and prior knowledge of other adeno vectors. Control of FP CQA is based on an integrated 
strategy  including  material  controls,  process  parameter  limits,  IPCs,  release  and  stability  testing  and 
GMP/ quality systems. A summary is provided of the criticality identification process and assessments 
for CPPs. Data supporting proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for CPP and non-CPP (nCPP) are provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 29/218 
 
 
 
 
 
However,  some  parameters  are  still  being  evaluated  and  are  classified  as  potentially  critical.  A  final 
conclusion  on  the  criticality  of  the  potentially  critical  parameters  should  be  provided  upon  availability 
(recommendation 10). The justifications of IPC acceptance criteria, including summaries of IPC results 
during the development and clinical manufacturing batches are provided.  
Information was provided on the different process variants used during product development and on the 
FP  batches  produced  thus  far.  The  differences  between  the  clinical  and  commercial  manufacturing 
processes  are  described  and  includes  changes  of  site,  change  from  single  to  multi-dose  and  scale. 
Information  is  provided  to  support  equivalence  of  the  clinical  trial  and  commercial  formulation  buffer 
composition and manufacture.  
Additionally, to evaluate the sensitivity of Ad26.COV2.S FP when exposed to light stress, a study based 
on  the  ICH  Q1B  requirement  will  be  performed.  The  samples  should  be  tested for  potency,  turbidity, 
radius and aggregation (recommendation 8). 
The AS thawing stage includes storage of AS at the FP manufacturing facility, thawing of frozen AS and 
an optional refrigerated intermediate hold step.  
Comparability  
A  comparability  analysis  was  performed  demonstrating  that  early  clinical  material  (phase  1/2)  was 
comparable to the FP lots used in the phase 3 trials (study 1). Based on an assessment of the release, 
IPC and characterisation results of the clinical batches the study 1 conclusions are that the Ad26.COV2.S 
FP batches produced using the post change manufacturing process variants are comparable to the FP 
batches produced using the pre change manufacturing process variant. This comparability assessment 
therefore  confirms  that  the  post-change  manufacturing  process  variants  introduced  do  not  adversely 
impact  the  quality,  safety  and  potency  of  the  Ad26.COV2.S  FP  batches.  A  forced  degradation  study 
(thermal stress) is ongoing in support of this comparability assessment (recommendation 9). 
Since  some  changes  have  also  been  introduced  in  the  FP  process  for  commercial  production,  a 
comparability analysis has been initiated to compare phase 3 FP lots and future commercial FP lots (study 
2). A 2-tiered approach has been proposed by the applicant to demonstrate comparability. According to 
this approach, initial comparability assessment (tier 1) consists of comparison of release and IPC results. 
If the release results of both pre- and post-change FP batches are within the commercial specifications, 
it will be concluded that the initial comparability criteria are met and post-use FP lots will be released for 
commercial use. This enables timely use of post-change materials to alleviate the high demand due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The tier 1 results have already been provided for the FP PPQ lots from the first 
FP  commercial  site  and  demonstrate  that  the  commercial  FP  is  comparable  to  the  clinical  material. 
Additional characterisation test results (tier 2) should be provided post-approval (recommendation 6). 
In addition, comparability data (tier 1 and tier 2) is requested for the second finished product site to 
confirm the FP is comparable to the FP from the first commercial site and the clinical material (Specific 
obligation 1). Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this approach 
is deemed acceptable.  
Container closure integrity tests (CCIT), residual seal force (RSF) tests and headspace analysis are used 
to validate the integrity of the container closure system and its ability to prevent the ingress of microbial 
contamination to the final product. In addition, Ad26.COV2.S FP samples have been tested for RSF at t 
= 0 and after 3 weeks of storage at -85 ºC confirming integrity of the FP container. Compatibility studies 
were performed mimicking vaccine administration conditions in the field to ensure that the steps required 
prior  to  administration  do  not  impact  the  quality  of  the  product.  Results  of  studies  investigating  the 
compatibility of  the  Ad26.COV2.S  FP  with  syringes and  needles used  for  intramuscular  administration 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

are presented. Physicochemical and biological stability as well as microbiological safety were assessed. 
Additionally, microbial growth for the in-use conditions was evaluated in a microbial challenge study.  
Container closure system 
Detailed information was provided on the multi-dose FP container closure system, which contains 5 
doses of the FP. The container closure system used for the FP is a 2R Type I glass vial closed with a 
latex-free rubber stopper (chlorobutyl with fluoropolymer coated surface), aluminium crimp and blue 
plastic cap. All relevant components (glass vials and rubber stoppers) comply with applicable Ph. Eur. 
guidance. 
Container closure integrity of the FP container was demonstrated. Extractables and leachables studies 
were performed (or are ongoing). The extractables study did not reveal any compounds of concern as 
regards safety. The applicant has provided data from an extractables study performed for Zabdeno 
(same container, vial and stopper). These data did not indicate any compounds of concern. Results 
from the leachables studies should be provided post-approval (recommendation 11). 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  FP  is  manufactured  at  different  manufacturing  sites.  Batch  certification  is  performed  at  Janssen 
Pharmaceutica N.V. (Beerse, BE) or Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL). All sites have appropriate GMP 
certification. A detailed listing of test sites and associated testing is stated in the dossier.  
A  major  objection  regarding  GMP  status  was  raised  for  three  FP  sites  however,  valid  proof  of  GMP 
compliance has now been provided for these sites. The major objection is resolved. 
The applicant has proposed an additional FP release testing site for sterility and endotoxin. However, 
qualification of this site is currently ongoing and is expected to be finalised in May 2021. Therefore, the 
applicant has requested a time-limited exemption allowing reliance on FP release testing for sterility and 
endotoxin conducted in registered sites that are located in a third country. This approach is acceptable. 
The length for the QC testing site exemption has been clearly defined (until 30 June 2021) and it concerns 
compendial  tests  (endotoxin  and  sterility).  Suitability  testing  will  be  performed  according  to 
pharmacopoeial  requirements  for  method  transfer  qualification  (see  Product  Information  Annex 
II.A).  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The FP manufacturing process consists of several steps. First, the AS is thawed, pre-filtered, pooled and 
diluted with pre-filtered formulation buffer. The formulated bulk is homogenised, sterile filtered in-line 
(two 0.2µm filters connected in series) and aseptically filled into vials, stoppered and capped. Filling is 
done immediately after sterile filtration. The sterile filtered bulk is not stored. Subsequently, the vials 
are visually inspected, frozen, labelled and packed. 
All steps of the FP manufacturing process at the proposed FP manufacturing sites have been described 
and information on CPPs and IPCs was provided. The proposed CPPs and IPCs are deemed adequate and 
sufficient to control the FP process.  
Prior to the start of sterile in-line filtration, both sterilising filters are tested to ensure filter integrity, and 
a bioburden sample is taken from the holding vessel.  
The minimum and maximum FP batch size has been defined for the proposed FP manufacturing sites. 
Hold times are defined. The formulation buffer used in the commercial FP manufacture is made at the 
commercial manufacturing site as part of the FP manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 31/218 
 
 
 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  Ad26.COV2.S  FP  consists  of  several  steps:  (1) 
validation of process steps, (2) validation of hold times during manufacturing process and (3) validation 
of media fills. 
Process verification and process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) studies have been performed for the 
FP  sites.  The  process  validation  for  manufacture  of  Ad26.COV2.S  FP  consisted  of  three  successful 
validation runs performed at the minimum, intermediate and maximum FP batch sizes. For each of the 
process validation runs, the IPC and FP product release met their predefined acceptance criteria and FP 
release  specifications,  respectively.  The  results  presented  in  this  section  demonstrate  that  the 
Ad26.COV2.S  FP  manufacturing  process  as  executed  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site  is  under 
control  and  produces  final  FP  of  consistent  quality  that  meets  specifications.  Continued  process 
verification (CPV), will be performed to assure that the FP process remains in a state of control during 
commercial  manufacture.  The  FP  manufacturing  process  at  the  site  is  adequately  validated.  Some 
additional  characterisation  data  to  confirm homogeneity  and the  hold times  should  be  provided  when 
available (recommendation 7).  
With regards to the second FP manufacturing site, batch data of the 3 PPQ lots were provided. All results 
were  compliant  with  the  FP  specifications  and  also highly  similar  to  release  test  results  from  phase 3 
clinical  lots  and  batches  from  the  first  site.  However,  the  complete  data  have  not  been  provided. 
Therefore, the applicant is requested to provide the full FP PPQ data from the 3 representative FP lots 
from  the  second  site  (including  hold  times).  In  addition,  comparability  data  (tier  1  and  tier  2)  are 
requested to confirm that the FP from this site is comparable to the FP from the first commercial site 
and  consequentially  also  confirm  comparability  with  clinical  material  (specific  obligation  1).  This 
approach is acceptable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic public health emergency. 
The applicant has submitted an updated section 3.2.S.2.5 on shipping validation including information 
on  air  transport.  All  shipping  routes  are  described  including  air  transport.  For  each  route  the  used 
shipping  systems  are  indicated.  All  shipping  systems,  including  the  ones  used  for  air  transport,  have 
been properly qualified via thermal qualification, distribution testing and shipping route verification.  
A media fill simulation has been executed which confirmed that the aseptic handling procedures and the 
environmental  conditions  for  the  filling  step  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  production  of  FP.  The 
operating parameters used for the media fill are set to challenge worst-case conditions that may occur 
during routine manufacturing and operational conditions. The vials are filled at high speeds (higher risk 
for interventions) and low speeds (prolonged exposure) to simulate worst-case production conditions. 
Filling is done immediately after sterile filtration. The sterile filtered bulk is not stored. Maximum times 
are  indicated  for  each  FP  process  step  (all  CPPs).  Therefore,  the  maximum  time  for  the  complete  FP 
process is defined as well as the maximum time of FP vials exposed to 2-8°C and to 25°C. 
Vials  are  depyrogenated  and  caps  are  steam  sterilised.  The  depyrogenation  and  autoclave  have  been 
adequately validated. The rubber stoppers are provided by the supplier as ready-to-use sterile rubber 
stoppers. The applicant has provided the requested information on the sterilisation of the stoppers. The 
stoppers  are  deemed  acceptable  for  use  in  the  FP  container.  Appropriate  filter  validation  reports  are 
provided and it is concluded that the filters are deemed suitable for the intended use.  
For the second FP site, sections 3.2.P.3.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation – Depyrogenation of Glass 
Vials,  3.2.P.3.5  Process  Validation  and/or  Evaluation  –  Sterilisation  of  Equipment  Components  and 
Stoppers,  and  3.2.P.3.5  Process  Validation  and/or  Evaluation  –  Decontamination  of  Filling  isolators 
should be provided post-authorisation (recommendation 5). 
Filled FP at first site is then shipped (between -30°C and -15°C) to a packaging site, where labelling and 
secondary packaging proceeds. This site then ships the packaged product (between -30°C and -15°C) 
Assessment report

to the Janssen Distribution Centres where it is stored between -30°C and -15°C. The shipping of the FP 
has been evaluated through a shipping route verification study and a distribution testing study which 
evaluated the impact of shipping on product packaging, including container closure integrity of the vials. 
Product specification  
Release and stability specifications as well as description of the analytical procedures were provided. The 
parameters tested are appearance (degree of coloration, clarity, and visible particles), identity by (ID)-
PCR  and  virus  protein  fingerprinting  by  RP-HPLC,  potency  with  transgene  expression  by  quantitative 
ELISA  and  infectious  units  by  QPA,  quantity  (virus  particles)  by  VP-qCR,  purity  (aggregates  average 
hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity) by DLS, safety tests (sterility, bacterial endotoxins, container 
closure  integrity)  and  general  tests  (pH,  osmolality,  extractable  volume,  and  polysorbate  80 
concentration).  The  FP  specification  acceptance  criteria  have  been  sufficiently  justified  and  the 
specification ranges are deemed acceptable.  
The FP specification for infectious units is considered the most important parameter for FP. The initially 
proposed lower limits for FP infectious units at release and end-of-shelf-life (EOSL) were lower than the 
potency of the phase 3 clinical lots and could not be considered as clinically qualified/justified (this was 
a major objection). Subsequently, the applicant increased the infectious units release lower limit and the 
end of shelf life limit.  
Since for immunogenicity and clinical efficacy the potency as expressed in infectious units is relevant, 
the  potency  of  the  vaccine  should  be  expressed  on  the  labelling  in  line  with  other  viral  vaccines. 
Therefore, it was proposed to change the labelling to “not less than 8.92 log10 Inf.U/dose”, instead of 
“not less than 2.5×1010 VP/dose”. The applicant agreed to express the labelling in Inf.U.  
Identity, bacterial endotoxins, osmolality, extractable volume and polysorbate 80 concentration are not 
tested during stability studies. A test for replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) is performed on the AS 
only. The ratio infectious units/viral particles is established at AS level and a similar specification has 
also been established for FP release.  
Since  currently  only  limited  experience is  available  for  the  polydispersity  specification,  the  applicant’s 
proposal to report the result without an acceptance criterion is acceptable. For the time being it is agreed 
that FP aggregates are sufficiently controlled by the hydrodynamic radius specification. However, it is 
expected that an acceptance criterion for polydispersity will be established and justified once sufficient 
experience and data for this parameter are available (recommendation 12). 
For the transgene expression a qualitative ELISA is performed to confirm expression. The applicant has 
properly justified the use of the assay for determining the transgene expression. The validation of this 
method has been briefly described. In addition, the applicant has pointed out how the relative transgene 
expression levels correlate linearly with infectivity results obtained by QPA, the latter being a quantitative 
way to measure infectivity of Ad26.COV2.S.  
For  the  extractable  volume,  the  applicant  states  that  the  acceptance  limit  of  ≥2.5  mL  ensures  that 
enough  volume  can  be  extracted  from  the  vial  for  correct  dosing  of  up  to  five  doses  of  0.5  mL  each 
(tested as 5 times an extraction of 0.5 mL).  
Due to the implementation of ICH Q3D guideline on elemental impurities, compliance to ICH Q3D should 
be confirmed. Although vaccines are strictly taken, not within the scope of ICH Q3D, a risk assessment 
of the elemental impurity level in the finished product should be performed in order to keep the same 
level of safety assurance on elemental impurities, as requested according to Ph. Eur. general chapter 
5.20. A summary of this risk assessment and a control strategy for elemental impurities in accordance 
with ICH Q3D should be provided (recommendation 13).

A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
No new impurities are introduced during the FP manufacture. The major objection is considered resolved. 
Analytical methods 
Descriptions  were  provided  for  all  the  analytical  methods  used  for  FP  release  testing.  The  analytical 
methods for virus identity, protein fingerprinting, transgene expression, infectious units, virus particles 
and  PS80  content  are  the  same  methods  as  used  for  the  AS.  Compendial  methods  are  used  for  pH, 
osmolality, extractable volume, sterility, endotoxin, container closure integrity and appearance. The only 
FP-specific method is the assay for aggregates. All non-compendial methods were appropriately validated 
at each test site. Compendial methods were verified to demonstrate that the methods are suitable for 
use with the current product and that no interference/inhibition occurs. Method suitability and absence 
of interference by the product were demonstrated for the endotoxin and sterility tests. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results are presented for clinical single dose finished product (FP) batches, non-clinical 
multidose FP batch, multidose commercial PPQ FP batches from the first commercial site and  multidose 
commercial  PPQ  FP  batches  from  the  second  site.  Information  regarding  batch  scale,  manufacturing 
dates and genealogy is provided Also, additional characterisation test results are provided. The single-
dose and multi-dose processes are highly similar. The main difference between the phase 3 process and 
commercial process is the scale of filling and the fill volume (single dose versus five-dose). The results 
are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The  applicant  provided  a  detailed  description  of  the  reference  materials  used  during  development. 
Reference  material  (RM)  is  used  as  a  control  in  release,  stability  and  in-process  testing,  and  for 
characterisation methods throughout the product development lifecycle. The same reference material is 
used for AS and FP testing. RM includes research material (ResMat) and development reference material 
(DRM). 
In the future, a primary reference material (PRM) and working reference material (WRM) will be derived 
from representative batches and qualified. The PRM and first WRM will be taken from different FP batches 
manufactured using the clinical Phase 3 DP manufacturing process. The FP used to prepare the PRM was 
made from AS from the small scale process (manufacturing process variant S-VAL-4) at 1 x 1011 VP/mL, 
and the FP used to prepare the WRM will be made from AS from the large scale process (manufacturing 
process variant S-VLF-2) at 2 x 1011 VP/mL. A qualification protocol for the primary reference material 
and working reference material has been provided and is deemed acceptable. For the time being, the 
DRM2 and DRM3 (both used during phase 3 studies) are considered sufficiently qualified and therefore 
suitable for use as reference material for commercial AS and FP.  
The ResMat was used for testing clinical batches (Phase 1, 2, and 3) and as the RM to qualify RM Batch 
(DRM1). This lot is used in part of the Phase 3 trials until implementation of RM Batches (DRM2) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 34/218 
 
 
 
(DRM3). The latter two are used for Phase 3 trials and first commercial lots (until a primary and working 
standard will be established in the future).  
The  applicant  has  provided  a  testing  protocol  for  future  primary  reference  standard  and  working 
reference standards, which is deemed sufficient and acceptable. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of the Ad26.COV2.S FP is 2 years when FP is stored frozen at -25°C to -15°C, 
with a single storage period of 3 months at 2°C to 8°C (not exceeding the expiry date).  
Within these 24 months, a 3 months storage at 2-8°C is also proposed. The FP should not be refrozen 
after it has been placed in storage at 2-8°C. The FP must be stored in the original packaging in order to 
protect it from light.  
Only a few early time points of Ad26.COV2.S stability studies on clinical batches (Phase 1-3) are currently 
available. The shelf life is based on platform data from similar Ad26 products. These platform products 
were  stored  in  the  same vials  as  Ad26.COV2.S  The  same  stability-indicating assays  were  used  in the 
studies  as  are  being  used  for  Ad26.COV2.S  commercial  product  studies.  Up  to  36  month-data  are 
provided from more than 50 FP lots at different temperatures (-80°, -20°C). This includes data from 4 
lots stored at -20°C for 36 months. These are considered sufficiently representative since the particles 
are identical (apart from the genome which contains a different insert). 
Based  on  these  data  and  input  from  other  development  studies,  a  conservative  shelf  life  model  was 
constructed  to  justify  the  proposed  initial  shelf  life  for  Ad26.COV2.S  FP.  In  this  model,  the  following 
factors were taken into account: AS stability, shelf life specifications, expected losses during packaging 
and labelling, temperature excursions, in-use and an estimate of the average degradation slope. 
Storage at -20°C or lower does not have any impact on FP quality; no trends are observed for potency. 
When stored at 2-8°C, a slight decrease in potency occurs over time. Using platform data and a model 
for potency decrease, the applicant has proposed that ‘once removed from the freezer, the unopened 
vaccine  may  be  stored  refrigerated  at  2°C  to  8°C,  protected  from  light,  for  a  single  period  of  up  to 
3 months, not exceeding the printed expiry date. Once thawed, the vaccine should not be re-frozen’. 
This period is considered conservative when taking into account the statistical model and the stability 
data from other Ad26 products.  
The applicant also indicates that the FP must be stored in the original packaging in order to protect it 
from  light.  As  requested,  the  applicant  provided  information  on  the  stability  study  and  the  risk 
assessment (in absence of photostability data). This is considered acceptable at this point. However, to 
evaluate the sensitivity of Ad26.COV2.S Finished Product when exposed to light stress, a study based 
on the ICH Q1B requirement should be performed. The samples should be tested for potency, turbidity, 
radius and aggregation (recommendation 8). 
The clinical single dose FP batches and the commercial multidose FP batch included in the stability 
studies will be stored in accordance with applicable ICH guidelines. In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported 
to EMA. 
As regards the in-use shelf life of the FP, it was shown during product development that:    
1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 35/218 
 
 
 
 
 
‘Chemical and physical in-use stability of the vaccine has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2°C to 
25°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should preferably be used immediately after 
first puncture of the vial; however, the product can be stored between 2°C-8°C for a maximum of 
6 hours or remain at room temperature (maximally 25°C) up to 3 hours after first puncture of the vial. 
Beyond these times, in-use storage is the responsibility of the user.’ 
The applicant is requested to provide the stability data from PPQ FP lots from the facility when 
available. In addition, for each additional FP manufacturing site, FP stability studies should be initiated 
and these data can be provided post-approval (recommendation 14).  
In addition, the applicant has investigated the possible impact of mechanical stress (experienced during 
transport) on the thawed finished product (potency and quality). No impact was observed. Moreover, it 
was  also  shown  that the vaccine  is  relatively  stable  when exposed to  room  temperature  for  a  limited 
period  of  time.  Therefore,  the  applicant  has  included  guidance  in  the  SmPC  with  regard  to  possible 
temperature excursions above 8°C and transport of the thawed vaccine.  
In conclusion, the FP shelf-life is adequately supported by the submitted data. A 2-year shelf life for the 
vaccine when stored between -25°C and -15°C (long-term storage) and the additional storage conditions 
described in section 6.4 (Special precautions for storage) of the SmPC are accepted. 
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
The applicant has provided a protocol for addition and validation of new sites for AS and FP production 
at  a  larger  scale.  Initially,  batches  for  clinical  development  and  small-scale  commercial  supply  are 
manufactured at a bioreactor scale of small scale. A process scale-up was established to manufacture 
AS at large scale. New sites are foreseen to manufacture at the large scale. Compared to the process 
used for clinical and small-scale commercial manufacturing, the scale-up is mostly linear and the unit 
operations  remain  the  same.  Where  applicable,  prior  knowledge  from  other  AdVac/PER.C6  platform-
based products has been and will be considered for the process design. 
Process  validation  protocols  are  provided.  In  order  to  evaluate  that  each  newly  introduced  AS 
manufacturing  site  is  capable  of  consistently  performing  manufacturing  process,  a  process 
validation/process  performance  qualification  (PV/PPQ)  campaign  based  on  preliminary  CPP  and 
preliminary critical material attributes (CMA) will be completed. A minimum of 3 AS or FP lots will be 
produced for PPQ; acceptance criteria for CPPs and critical material attributes must be met (with potential 
necessary adjustments due to site or scale elements); results for IPC and release tests must comply with 
the acceptance criteria and the specifications. 
The  AS  process  at  large  bioreactor  scale  will  be  transferred  to  additional  manufacturing  sites. 
Implementation  of  new  manufacturing  sites  may  result  in  limited  changes  to  process  parameter  set-
points/ranges, equipment and raw materials. The applicant has previously successfully applied similar 
process changes, e.g., AS manufacturing site transfers, to manufacture other AdVac/PER.C6 platform-
based vaccine candidates that have met their specifications. Initial release and characterisation testing 
of  the  large  scale  AS  batches  of  other  AdVac/PER.C6  platform-based  vaccine  products  demonstrated 
comparable quality of the vaccine. 
Initially,  FP  batches  were  manufactured  for  commercial  supply.  The  commercial  FP  manufacturing 
process has been scaled up and will be transferred to additional sites to increase manufacturing capacity.  
To  demonstrate  comparability  of  AS  or  FP,  a  2-tiered  approach  is  proposed  by  the  applicant.  Initial 
comparability assessment (tier 1) will consist of comparison of release and IPC results and some limited 
characterisation. If the release results of both pre- and post-change FP batches are within the commercial 
specifications, it will be concluded that the initial comparability criteria are met and post-use lots will be

released  for  commercial  use.  This  enables  timely  use  of  post-change  materials  to  alleviate  the  high 
demand  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  additional  characterisation  test  results  (tier  2)  will  be 
provided post-approval. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this 
approach is deemed acceptable. 
In  addition,  the  applicant  also  proposes  a  post-approval  change  management  protocol  (PACMP)  to 
optimise  the  cell  culture  steps  and  to  use  new  equipment  for  stage  7  (chromatography)  and  stage  8 
(diafiltration) to increase the AS process capacity. Process validation protocols and stability protocols are 
provided and a similar comparability analysis with two tiers is proposed. 
The proposed PACMPs to introduce and validate additional AS production sites and FP production sites 
using processes at a larger scale, as well as to optimise the large scale AS process to increase capacity, 
and to demonstrate comparability of AS/FP, are deemed acceptable. 
Finally, an additional PACMP has been proposed to add new QC testing sites. New QC sites will be qualified 
based on predefined analytical method validation or verification protocols. Compendial test methods will 
be  verified  at  the  new  QC  test  site  according  to  pharmacopeial  requirements.  Non-compendial  test 
methods will be transferred by co-validation or by comparative testing (i.e., equivalency). Acceptance 
criteria for test method validation will be at least equally strict as the acceptance criteria used during 
original  method  validation  as  described  in  the  dossier.  The  applied  acceptance  criteria  are  deemed 
sufficiently stringent and thus adequate. This PACMP and the proposed approach to introduce and qualify 
additional QC testing sites is deemed acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant adequately described the adventitious agents’ safety aspects.  
Adventitious  agents’  safety  for  Ad26.COV2.S  is  assured  through  the  design  and  control  of  the 
manufacturing  process:  controlled  selection  and  appropriate  specifications  for  raw  materials  and 
excipients, and specifications, in-process controls and release testing for starting materials, AS and FP. 
None  of  the  raw  materials  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the  MVS,  intermediate  virus  passage,  WVS, 
inoculum, MCB, WCB, LVHD, AS, or FP batches was identified as being of direct animal or human origin. 
None of the excipients was of animal or human origin. However, one of the raw materials used in the 
manufacture  of  the  MVS/WVS/AS  (as  a  processing  aid)  was  identified  as  involving  animal-derived 
products in its production process: benzonase. It is demonstrated, though, that it does not present any 
adventitious agents safety risk. No transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) risk deriving from 
the use of these materials has been identified.  
With respect to microbial adventitious contamination (bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and mycoplasma), 
appropriate  microbial  controls  are  performed on  the  starting  materials.  Furthermore,  all the  solutions 
and buffers used in the downstream process are manufactured aseptically according to cGMP referential 
conditions by a validated sterile filtration method and tested according to the European Pharmacopoeia. 
In  addition,  microbial  controls  are  performed  during  the  cGMP  manufacturing.  Adequate  controls  and 
specifications for starting materials, raw materials and excipients, appropriate specifications, in-process 
controls, release tests, and validation of the relevant steps demonstrate that the MVS, WVS, AS and FP 
are prepared under conditions designed to minimise the risk of microbial contamination. 
With respect to adventitious viruses, the preMVS material has been tested for in vitro adventitious agents 
(on Vero, MRC-5, and HeLa cells); no viral contaminants were detected. Testing of the MVS with respect 
to viral safety is detailed. No viral contaminants were detected. The PER.C6 TetR-derived cell substrates 
have also been tested extensively tested by the general viral safety tests for adventitious or endogenous 
viruses/retroviruses and by PCR for specific human viruses. No porcine or bovine viruses were detected.

The  manufacturing  process  does  not  have  a  dedicated,  validated  viral  clearance  step.  Because  the 
product is a non-enveloped virus vector, it is not possible to implement specific (non-enveloped) viral 
clearance steps in the manufacturing process.  
The applicant has included RCA test as release test for the AS. TSE, viral and microbial safety has been 
suitably assured.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The quality information for the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen presented during the MAA has been thoroughly 
assessed.  A  list  of  questions  was  generated,  which  included  three  major  objections,  related  to  GMP, 
nitrosamine risk assessment and acceptance criterion for infectivity during shelf-life.   
Adequate responses were provided to address the major objections and other concerns and to support 
Conditional  Marketing  Authorisation.  Additional  validation,  release  and  comparability  data  have  been 
submitted for AS and FP manufacturing sites. Necessary EU GMP certificates for the manufacturing and 
testing sites were subsequently provided.  
Further information is provided below on the resolution of the major objections and the rationale for 
accepting some open issues to be addressed as a specific obligation post-marketing. Several other 
issues are further highlighted as recommendations to be addressed by the applicant post-approval. 
In addition, it should be ensured that, in accordance with Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 
16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the active substance and finished product are manufactured and 
controlled by means of processes and methods in compliance with the latest state of scientific and 
technical progress. As a consequence, the manufacturing processes and controls (including the 
specifications) shall be designed to ensure product consistency and a product quality of at least shown 
to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and shall introduce any subsequent changes to their 
manufacturing process and controls as needed. 
The dossier is of acceptable quality however, certain information and data remain to be provided. 
Despite the short time frame of product development, sufficient data to support conditional marketing 
authorisation are provided and key areas requiring completion are explained below. These further data 
will be addressed in a specific obligation and other post-approval measures (recommendations).  
The  Ad26.COV2.S  AS  and  FP  manufacturing  processes  and  process  controls  are  described  in  detail. 
Quality of process intermediates is adequately controlled by in-process controls. Both a small-scale AS 
process and a large scale AS process are included in the MAA.  
The following issues have been addressed during the procedure: 
A  major  objection  was  raised  with  regards  to  the  GMP  compliance  of  AS  and  FP  manufacturing  sites. 
Proof of GMP compliance has been provided for all relevant sites. In addition, GMP inspections have been 
performed for and GMP certificates have been issued resolving the major objection.  
The small scale AS process at Janssen Vaccines and Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL) and the large scale AS 
processes  at  Janssen  Biologics  B.V.  (Leiden,  NL)  and  Emergent  Baltimore  (USA)  have  been  properly 
validated. In addition, production of the inoculum (used for the large scale process) has been validated 
and results from the 3rd PPQ lot should be provided post-approval (recommendation 1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 38/218 
 
 
 
The FP manufacturing process at the first commercial FP site is adequately validated. Some additional 
characterisation  data  to  confirm  homogeneity  and  the  hold  times  should  be  provided  post-approval 
(recommendation 7).   
With regards to the second commercial FP site, batch data of the 3 PPQ lots were provided. All results 
were  compliant  with  the  FP  specifications  and  also highly  similar  to  release  test  results  from  phase 3 
clinical  lots  and  batches  from  the  first  commercial  site.  This  is  sufficient  to  support  approval  of  the 
conditional marketing authorisation, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic public health emergency, 
supporting a conclusion that the site can consistently manufacture FP. However, full PPQ data (including 
hold time) are required for the second commercial site to complete the data package from this facility. 
These data are requested post-approval (specific obligation 1).  
Data supporting proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for CPP and non-CPP (nCPP) are provided. However, 
some parameters are still being evaluated and are classified as potentially critical. A final conclusion on 
the criticality of these parameters should be provided upon availability (recommendation 10). Some 
process  changes  were  introduced  during  clinical  development  and  were  qualified  by  a  comparability 
analysis  confirming  the  absence  of  any  impact  on  product  quality.  Some  further  optimisations  were 
introduced for the AS/FP processes that will be used for the initial commercial batches. To demonstrate 
comparability, the applicant has used a 2-tiered comparability approach that comprises a combination 
of  release  testing  and  additional  characterisation  testing.  Both  the  results  for  release  tests  and 
characterisation  tests  were  highly  similar.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  AS  lots  from  the 
commercial small scale process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL) are comparable to 
the lots used in the Phase 3 clinical trials. Moreover, it was also shown that AS lots produced using the 
large  scale  processes  at  Janssen  Biologics  B.V.  (Leiden,  NL)  and  Emergent  Baltimore  (USA)  were 
comparable to clinical AS lots and to AS lots small scale site. Tier 2 comparability data to confirm that 
the large scale AS (from Janssen Biologics B.V., Leiden, NL) is comparable to the small scale process 
material  (from  Janssen  Vaccines  &  Prevention  B.V.,  Leiden,  NL)  (recommendation  2)  and  tier  2 
comparability  data  to  confirm  that the large  scale  AS  (from  Emergent,  USA)  is  comparable  to  the  AS 
from the other commercial AS sites (recommendation 3) should be submitted post-authorisation. 
With regards to the FP manufacture, FP lots from the first FP site were shown to be comparable to the 
phase 3 clinical FP lots. Tier 2 comparability data for confirmation should be submitted post-authorisation 
(recommendations 6). In addition, a forced degradation study (thermal stress) is ongoing to support 
further comparability assessment between clinical Phase1/2 lots and phase 3 lots (recommendation 
9).  
With regards to the second site, the batch release data (3 lots) are very consistent and also highly similar 
to  release  data  from  Phase  3  clinical  lots  and  batches  from  the  first  commercial  FP  site  and  provide 
already  some  indication  about  the  process  validation  and  comparability.  However,  comparability  data 
(tier 1 and tier 2) are requested to confirm that the FP from the second commercial site is comparable 
to the FP from the first site and consequentially also confirm comparability with clinical material (specific 
obligation  1).  This  approach  is  acceptable  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  public  health 
emergency. 
FP  release  testing  for  endotoxin  and  sterility  will  be  temporary  performed  in  registered  sites  that  are 
located in the US until 30 June 2021. From 30 June 2021 onwards, FP release testing for endotoxin and 
sterility will be performed by a site located in the EU. This is deemed acceptable in the context of the 
COVID-19 pandemic public health emergency. As it concerns compendial tests (endotoxin and sterility), 
suitability  testing  will  be  performed  according  to  pharmacopoeial  requirements  for  method  transfer 
qualification. Annex II.A of the Product Information reflects this temporary exemption. 
The absence of evaluation of the risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product in 
accordance with the published Art. 5(3) Referral on Nitrosamines was raised as a major objection. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 39/218 
 
 
 
applicant has performed a risk assessment for both the AS and FP Manufacturing process with regard to 
possible nitrosamine impurities. Importantly, it concerns a biological process that does not contain any 
chemical synthesis steps. No nitrosating agent is used in the manufacturing process. Based on the AS/FP 
manufacturing process conditions and the nature of the starting materials, raw materials, excipients and 
equipment used, the risk for nitrosamines is considered negligible.  
A summary of this risk assessment of the elemental impurity level in the finished product in accordance 
with ICH Q3D should be provided post-approval (recommendation 13). 
A  third  major  objection  was  raised  on  the  need  to  revise  the  lower  limit  of  the  FP  specification  for 
infectious units. To address this issue the applicant has increased the infectious units release lower limit 
and the end of shelf life limit. In addition, the test for RCA has been included in the AS specifications. 
The upper limit for HCP (AS specification) has been revised. The specifications proposed for the AS and 
FP are deemed acceptable. However, it is expected that an acceptance criterion for polydispersity will be 
established  and  justified  once  sufficient  experience  and  data  for  this  parameter  are  available 
(recommendation 12). 
Since for immunogenicity and clinical efficacy the potency as expressed in infectious units is relevant, 
the potency of the vaccine should be expressed on the labelling in line with other viral vaccines. Hence, 
it was proposed to change labelling to “not less than 8.92 log10 Inf.U/dose”, instead of “not less than 
2.5×1010 VP/dose”. The applicant agreed to express the labelling in Inf.U. 
Container closure systems of AS and FP were properly qualified. The applicant should provide the results 
of the 6 month time point of the FP container leachables (recommendation 11). 
A shelf life of AS when the AS is stored frozen was proposed by the applicant.  
The proposed shelf life for the FP is 24 months when stored frozen at -25°C to -15°C, and within these 
24 months, 3 months when stored at 2 to 8°C. These shelf lives are based on platform data from similar 
Ad26 products. The currently proposed shelf lives for AS and FP are deemed sufficiently qualified and 
justified and are thus acceptable. Product-specific stability data will be generated and should be provided 
when available (recommendations 4 and 14). The proposed stability testing protocols are acceptable. 
Additionally, 
the  applicant  should  provide  data 
from  photostability  studies  post-approval 
(recommendation 8). 
The  applicant  has  provided  PACMP  protocols  for  addition  and  validation  of  new  sites  for  AS  and  FP 
production at a larger scale. Process validation protocols include production of a minimum of 3 AS or FP 
lots for PPQ; acceptance criteria for CPPs and critical material attributes must be met; results for IPC 
and  release  tests  must  comply  with  the  acceptance  criteria  and  the  specifications.  To  demonstrate 
comparability of AS or FP, a 2-tiered approach is proposed. Initial comparability assessment (tier 1) will 
consist of comparison of release and IPC results and some limited characterisation. If the release results 
of both pre- and post-change FP batches are within the commercial specifications, it will be concluded 
that the initial comparability criteria are met and post-use lots will be released for commercial use. This 
enables timely use of post-change materials to alleviate the high demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The additional characterisation test results (tier 2) will be provided post-approval. Given the COVID-19 
pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this approach is deemed acceptable. Furthermore, 
another PACMP has been provided to optimise the cell culture steps and to use new equipment for stage 
7 (chromatography) and stage 8 (diafiltration) to increase the AS process capacity. Process validation 
protocols  and  stability  protocols  are  provided  and  a  similar  comparability  analysis  with  two  tiers  is 
proposed. The PACMPs and the proposed approach to introduce and validate additional AS production 
sites and FP production sites using processes at a larger scale, as well as to optimise the large scale AS 
process to increase capacity, and to demonstrate comparability of AS/FP, is deemed acceptable.

Finally, an additional PACMP has been proposed to add new QC testing sites. New QC sites will be qualified 
based on predefined analytical method validation or verification protocols. Acceptance criteria for test 
method validation will be at least equally strict as the acceptance criteria used during original method 
validation as described in the dossier. This PACMP and the proposed approach to introduce and qualify 
additional QC testing sites is deemed acceptable. 
All other issues raised during the procedure are considered solved and from quality point of view the 
marketing authorisation application for COVID-19 vaccine Janssen is acceptable. 
Impact on the benefit-risk assessment 
Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of the vaccine.  
The active substance and finished product are acceptable in relation to control of critical quality attributes 
and impurities.  
Studies to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency of the finished product in terms of process validation 
studies/process performance qualification studies (PPQ) have not been fully completed in the finished 
product commercial manufacturing sites. Nonetheless, sufficient data have been provided for full scale 
lots (including some PPQ lots) at the commercial sites and at other sites using the commercial process.  
In  order  to  confirm  the  consistency  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process,  the  applicant  is 
requested to provide the completed process validation (including hold times) and comparability data for 
the Catalent Indiana LLC site.  
It is considered likely that the applicant will be able to provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the 
specific obligation.  
Based upon the applicant’s justification and commitment, and in view of the public health emergency, 
detailed plans have been agreed with the applicant and reflected in the quality part of this assessment 
regarding  data  to  be  generated  and  submitted  with  interim  milestones  for  assessment  in  order  to 
complete  the  proposed  specific  obligation.  Based  on  the  applicant’s  plans  and  documentation,  it  is 
expected that data to fulfil the quality SO will be submitted by mid-August 2021. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The data presented to support consistent quality of this medicinal product is considered sufficient in 
the context of a conditional marketing authorisation in the current (COVID-19) pandemic emergency 
situation. To complete the quality documentation in the framework of the conditional marketing 
authorisation, the applicant is requested to fulfil the specific obligation (SO) post-approval. 
The CHMP has identified a specific obligation to address the quality development issues that may have 
a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product, and which therefore is needed 
to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical (quality) data and controls for the product. The specific points 
that need to be addressed in order to fulfil the imposed specific obligation are mentioned below.  
In accordance with Article 16 of regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall inform the Agency of any 
information which might influence the quality of the medicinal product concerned, such as any necessary 
tightening of the finished product specifications. This is also related to the general obligation to vary the 
terms of the marketing authorisation to take into account the technical and scientific progress and enable 
the  medicinal  product  to  be  manufactured  and  checked  by  means  of  generally  accepted  scientific 
methods (see the proposed recommendations). 
To complete the quality documentation in the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation, the 
applicant should fulfil the following specific obligation (SOs) post-approval.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The proposed candidate vaccine is an Ad26 vector with deletions in the early region (E1) of the Ad26 
genome, rendering it replication incompetent. The Ad26.COV2.S vector contains a transgene in the 
ΔE1A/E1B region which encodes a modified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with stabilizing 
modifications, i.e. 2 amino acid changes in the S1/S2 junction that knock out the furin cleavage site, 
and 2 proline substitutions in the hinge region known to stabilise the prefusion conformation. The wild-
type full-length S gene information was obtained from a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Wuhan, 2019, 
whole genome sequence NC_045512).  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 43/218 
 
 
 
A similar Adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector encoding the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus Zaire 
(ZEBOV) Mayinga strain has been approved in Europe through Centralised Procedure (Zabdeno, INN: 
Ebola vaccine rDNA, replication-incompetent; Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/005337/0000). The current 
application concerns a single dose regimen. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The non-clinical pharmacology of the Ad26.COV2.S candidate was evaluated in mice, rabbits, Syrian 
hamsters, and non-human primates (NHP) (rhesus monkey). Before selection of Ad26.COV2.S, 
different vaccine constructs with design elements previously shown to be successful for other 
coronavirus S protein-based vaccines were compared in in vitro and in vivo studies. The combination of 
the wild-type signal peptide, the furin cleavage site mutations, and the proline substitutions translated 
into superior immunogenicity in mice, Syrian hamsters, and non-human primates (NHP) (Bos et al., 
2020; Mercado et al., 2020; van der Lubbe et al., 2021). The in vivo testing in NHP showed that the 
design of Ad26.COV2.S was optimal in inducing robust neutralising antibody responses as well as 
protection following SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Mercado et al., 2020).  
Mice 
The murine model was used to examine immunogenicity by assessing antibody and cellular immune 
responses after immunisation, including T helper cell (Th) polarisation of the immune response. The 
mice used were aged 10 to 12 weeks, which is considered to correspond to adult age in humans. In 
study 9346-20004, a dose level dependent induction of binding antibodies was observed at day 14 and 
28 after vaccination. The stabilizing mutations present in Ad26.COV2.S compare favourably with 
binding antibody titers induced by a vaccine candidate coding for WT Spike protein, and this is 
confirmed in the virus neutralisation assay. Data from IFN-γ ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining 
(ICS) assays show that T cell responses are induced, with a higher response in the CD8+ T cell 
compartment compared to the CD4+ compartment and indicate that IFN-γ is predominantly generated 
by CD8+ T cells.  
The second study (9346-20007) was designed to determine the Th1/Th2 balance induced by a single 
dose of Ad26.COV2.S (1/5th of a human dose). Immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S was compared to 
recombinant adjuvanted S protein, known to induce a Th2 type immune response. Ad26.COV2.S was 
shown to induce the Th1 associated cytokine IFN-γ in ELISpot and multiplex ELISA assays, in contrast 
to alum adjuvanted Spike protein, 2 weeks post vaccination. The Th1 skewed immune response was 
demonstrated by a favourable ratio of IFN-γ to the Th2 associated cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10. In 
Balb/c mice, high IgG1 subclass with no IgG2a is associated with a Th2 response, whereas a balanced 
IgG2a/IgG1 ratio is indicative of a Th1-directed response. The ratio of anti-S protein antibody 
subclasses IgG2a and IgG1 was significantly higher for Ad26.COV2.S compared to alum adjuvanted 
Spike protein, with high IgG2a levels observed only after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. These results 
confirm the induction of a favourable immune response in view of a potential for vaccine associated 
enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD).  
NZW Rabbits 
An immunogenicity study in rabbits [study TOX14369 (TV-TEC-175060)] shows that immunisation with 
a dose corresponding to 1/10th or a full human dose induces an immune response towards the antigen 
of the insert, which qualifies this species as relevant for the toxicological assessment. In addition, a

second dose of vaccine 56 days after the first immunisation triggers a booster in both the humoral and 
cellular responses. 
Syrian hamsters 
In the two hamster efficacy studies, the challenge dose was 102 TCID50, which is lower than the dose 
reported in some publications (Sia et al, 2020, Tostanoski et al., 2020), but justified by results from 
Van der Lubbe et al. showing that a low dose challenge inoculum (102 TCID50) induces a comparable 
viral load and disease compared with higher viral dose challenges. This dose was therefore selected to 
allow assessment of the occurrence of more severe disease in this model compared to NHPs and to 
evaluate the theoretical risk for VAERD. However, it actually conferred rather mild pneumonia without 
any clinical signs apart from body weight loss.  
The aim of the first challenge study performed in the hamster [TKO 707 (TV-TEC-175626)] was to 
compare immunogenicity and protection of Ad26.COV2.S with other Ad26-based candidate SARS-CoV-
2 vaccines, in a one- and two-dose schedule. Animals were challenged 4 weeks following immunisation 
and followed for 4 days after infection. This 4-day follow-up period is also justified by prior studies 
(Van der Lubbe et al.), showing that a 4-day follow up time after challenge is the most optimal time 
point to simultaneously evaluate lung tissue viral load and histopathology.   
A single immunisation with 1/50th or 1/5th of a human dose of Ad26.COV2.S induces S protein binding 
antibodies as of Week 2 post-immunisation. A second dose increased binding antibody titers but levels 
returned to those observed before the second dose within 4 weeks. A single immunisation with 
Ad26.COV2.S induced SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies, starting at Week 2 and increasing at Week 
4. In contrast to binding antibody titers, a second dose led to significantly higher neutralising antibody 
titers throughout the study period (challenge followed 4 weeks post-immunisation).  
Ad26.COV2.S given in a 1-dose or 2-dose regimen resulted in a lower lung viral load compared with 
the Ad26.Empty mock-immunised animals. That load was below the limit of detection for the majority 
of animals immunised with Ad26.COV2.S. This reduction in viral load was however less apparent in the 
upper respiratory tracts as the presence of infectious virus after challenge was also detected in 
vaccinated challenged animals independent of the 1- or 2-dose schedule.  
The results of histopathological examination confirm the viral load results, i.e. a 2-dose regimen with 
Ad26.COV2.S induced a significant reduction in LRT histopathology scores and limited effects on URT 
histopathology scores after challenge. Due to a technical error only limited histopathology data are 
available for the 1-dose schedule hampering any conclusion on the potential benefits of a 2-dose. 
Finally, there were no signs of VAERD observed in animals dosed with Ad26.COV2.S compared with the 
control group for any of the parameters assessed. 
Four days post inoculation, body weight loss was significantly reduced in animals vaccinated with a 
single dose of Ad26.COV2.S compared to controls, but this reduction was not evident in the 2-dose 
group, compared with controls.  
Although the addition of a second dose 4 weeks after the first immunisation induces an increase in 
neutralising antibodies in the hamster model, a clear benefit in terms of weight loss reduction, viral 
loads or pathological scores could not be demonstrated in this model.  
Both in terms of immune responses and protection from infection, Ad26.COV2.S compared favourably 
with the other vaccine candidates tested in this study. 
The second hamster experiment [TKO 766 (study TV-TEC-176250)] was designed to determine the 
immunogenicity and efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in a 1-dose regimen in Syrian hamsters at different doses 
of 107 ,108, 109 or 1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S, with the highest dose corresponding to 1/5th of a human 
dose. The negative control groups received 1010 vp of an Ad26 vector not encoding any SARS-CoV-2

antigens. In this study lower dose levels of Ad26.COV2.S were included, with the aim of inducing 
suboptimal immune responses, allowing breakthrough viral replication in the lungs post inoculation 
with SARS-CoV-2. Under these conditions it can be investigated whether there is any increased risk for 
VAERD compared with a non-vaccinated control group. Viral load, body weight loss, and lung 
histopathology were measured after inoculation. In the present experiment as well, there were no 
illness signs, apart from body weight loss, which appears similar among all groups, only slightly 
reduced by vaccination.  
A single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S led to dose level-dependent induction of S protein binding 
and neutralising antibodies, a dose level-dependent reduction in median lung viral load after 
inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 and a dose level-dependent reduction in LRT histopathology scores. A 
dose of 108 vp (or below) Ad26.COV2.S resulted in a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured 
by the viral load in lung tissue. If breakthrough infection occurred, no increase of viral load was noted 
compared with the infection in the control group. There was no indication of increased lung pathology 
in the vaccinated animals even at lower doses and no presence of eosinophils were noted upon 
histopathological analyses, showing that the presence of low levels of neutralising antibodies elicited by 
sub-optimal Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses do not aggravate lung disease in challenged Syrian hamsters 
compared to controls. 
The conclusions appear similar to those for the previous experiment in hamsters, i.e. prior 
immunisation seems to protect animals mainly from a lower respiratory tract infection and it seems 
that the benefits of the vaccine in terms of upper respiratory tract protection are not clearly apparent, 
as measured by viral load (infective and viral RNA material), histopathological scores and 
immunohistochemistry.  
The applicant also conducted a correlate of protection analysis showing that the binding and 
neutralisation titers inversely correlate to the viral loads and histopathology scores in the lower 
respiratory tract.  
The results published by Tostanoski et al. confirm some of the findings from the 2 studies reviewed 
above, i.e.; a single administration of 1/50th or 1/5th of a human dose of the Ad26.COV2.S protects 
against severe disease and mortality in hamsters infected with a high dose of 5*105 TCID50. The 
vaccinated animals showed a minimal interstitial pneumonia whereas the controls displayed moderate 
to severe multifocal pneumonia characterised by consolidation affecting 30 to 60% of lung 
parenchyma. This publication also confirms that humoral immune responses correlate inversely with 
lung viral load after challenge. Unlike in those previous studies, in this model a correlation of the 
humoral response with upper respiratory tract viral load was also identified. 
The efficacy of the vaccine in hamsters in terms of protection against body weight loss was not clear 
from the two previous studies in hamsters discussed above. In this paper however, it seems that prior 
immunisation protects against severe weight loss noted in the naïve challenged animals (-4% versus -
19.9%). This 4% loss in vaccinated animals actually looks similar to that reported in the above studies. 
It appears that prior immunisation of hamsters does not prevent a slight weight loss but seems 
efficacious to prevent an increased weight loss when severe disease is induced. 
The presence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract was not assessed in either studies but are 
reported in Tostanoski et al. showing that prior immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S decreases the amount 
and time of detection of viral load in GI, spleen, liver and kidney compared to sham challenged 
animals.  
Based on the data presented in hamster immunogenicity and challenge studies we can conclude that 
vaccination with one or two doses of Ad26COV2.S at 109 and 1010 vp 4 weeks prior to challenge 
protects the animals from mild to severe infection as noted by reduction of findings in the lower 
Assessment report

respiratory tract (viral loads, histopathology and immunohistochemistry). The antibodies generated 
following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S correlate with protection in the lower respiratory tract of 
hamsters. Their correlation with protection of upper respiratory tract is not clearly established. 
Non-human primates 
The NHP model assessed the immune response following one administration of the candidate vaccine 
and the protection following challenge. The high level of genetic homology between NHPs and humans, 
and their comparative immunology make NHPs a suitable model for studies of vaccine immunogenicity.  
In study NHP 20-09, the NHPs were immunised IM with a single dose of 1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (N=6) 
which corresponds to twice the human dose. A negative control group received saline only. The NHPs 
were inoculated with 1x105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020, by the intranasal and 
intratracheal routes 6 weeks after immunisation. Although this study serves as non-clinical proof of 
concept, it appears that all animals remained healthy throughout the study and no clinical signs or 
changes on pulmonary radiographs or in inflammatory parameters or even significant differences in 
scores upon histopathological examination are reported. In addition, a rapid decrease in viral load in 
both URT and LRT shown in sham immunised animals was also reported. This may be due to the fact 
that macaques only recapitulate moderate COVID-19 disease, the young age (3-9 years) and healthy 
status of the animals and also given the low viral load used to inoculate the animals compared to 
published data. In conclusion, although the NHP challenge model is considered adequate to 
demonstrate immunogenicity, and viral clearance, it appears insufficient to demonstrate efficacy 
against the disease. It can be considered relevant for the modelling of asymptomatic or mild to 
moderate forms of disease in humans. 
The immunogenicity results show that a single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S induces antibodies 
against the S protein as well as neutralising antibodies. Regarding the cellular responses, they are 
considered as rather low and variable.  
The main efficacy read-out in the NHP study noted was the reduction of viral load in the upper and 
lower respiratory tract (URT/LRT) in the vaccinated animals as measured by reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detecting sub-genomic SARS-CoV-2 mRNA (sgRNA). This viral 
load was below the limit of detection (LOD) in the LRT in 6/6 NHP immunised with Ad26.COV2.S, and 
in nasal swab samples, viral load was below the LOD in 5/6 NHP. All control animals showed detectable 
lung and nasal swab viral load after challenge. Rectal and throat swabs were not collected to assess 
the presence of the virus, and Luminex and ICS were not performed on BALs. This is unfortunate as 
those results would have been important for the assessment of the candidate vaccine absence of ERD 
potential (particularly in the absence of clinical disease in the controls). The histopathology findings 
were very mild especially in females of both groups and no histopathologic evidence of VAERD was 
observed in the NHP study.  
Some limited data were presented on the immune response 2 weeks post challenge (at week 8 post 
immunisation). These data showed that levels of neutralising antibodies post challenge seem to remain 
at a stable level while binding antibodies seem to increase after challenge. The cause for this 
discrepancy is unknown. Regarding the cellular immunity, ICS was performed 2 weeks post challenge 
but not analysed in favour of analysis of clinical ICS data. ELISpot results show a decrease 2 weeks 
after challenge, compared to the response observed before challenge (timepoint 4 weeks after 
immunisation; response in 5 out of 6 NHP). The applicant hypothesised that recruitment of specific T 
cells towards respiratory tracts could have reduced the systemic cellular responses but this explanation 
remains only theoretical. 
NHP Study 20-14 [study TV-TEC-176763] is a dose level titration study with Ad26.COV2.S, applying 
dose levels of 1x1011 vp, 5x1010 vp, 1.125x1010 vp, and 2x109 vp, administered as a single dose, to

further characterise the relationship between humoral and cellular immunogenicity and protective 
efficacy. A single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S dose level-dependently induced protection from 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in LRT and URT. Protection rate in the LRT was 100% within the groups that 
received either 1x1011 vp or 5x1010 vp Ad26.CoV2.S and 80% within the groups immunised with either 
1.125x1010vp or 2x109 vp (N=5 per dose level). Protection rate in the URT was reduced at each dose 
level titration step, from 100% to 80%, 60% and 20%. Ad26.COV2.S dose-dependently induced 
neutralising (measured by psVNA) and binding (S or RBD ELISA) antibodies. T cell responses, 
measured by IFN-γ ELISpot, were also dose dependent but rather low and variable.  
Since a higher number of breakthrough infections was observed in the nose compared to the lung, 
these data suggest that protection in the upper respiratory tract may require higher vaccine doses 
offering a higher level of systemic immune responses. This study confirms that Ad26.COV2.S protects 
from infection as demonstrated in study NHP 20-09. In addition, a dose response relationship was 
demonstrated for immune markers as well as viral load.   
Vaccination of rhesus monkeys with Ad26.COV2.S at all dose levels followed by inoculation with SARS-
CoV-2, was associated with considerably lower average lung pathology scores and the absence of 
virus-induced lung pathology, when compared to unvaccinated/sham-dosed challenged animals, 
demonstrating protection against viral challenge. It should be noted that the additional subgroup of 
control animals, with an age of 7-8y (=efficacy only group), had higher average scores compared to 
the initial control group (PBS-vaccinated, and at the age of 5y like the vaccine groups); 33.2 versus 
24.87 respectively. This is in line with viral loads in the LRT. Within these groups, there was 
considerable variability in lung histopathology scores, but there were no obvious differences between 
males and females. Thus, in the control animals in general but especially in the age-matched control 
group pneumonia induced after challenge was very mild and without clinical signs.  
In addition to the evidence of protection, vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S was not associated with an 
increase in the severity of lung findings (no increase in lung scores) even in animals having a 
breakthrough infection when compared to unvaccinated animals after challenge, indicating there was 
no histopathologic evidence of VAERD.  
Data from 3 NHP studies (NHP 20-07, 20-09 and 20-14) were pooled for correlate of protection 
analysis. The design of those studies is similar: NHP were vaccinated with a single dose of Ad26-
based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (1011 vp for study 20-07 and 20-09, dose titration range 1011-
2.109 vp for study NHP 20-14), followed by challenge via intranasal and intratracheal route with same 
strain (USA-WA1/2020) at same dose (105 TCID50) at week 6 or 7. Ad26.COV2.S was not evaluated in 
study NHP 20-07 but 7 other Ad26 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates were tested in comparable 
conditions. The same immunogenicity assays (2 pseudovirus neutralisation assays (Nexelis 
pseudoparticle based on modified VSV; and BIDMC with pseudotyped particles made from a modified 
lentivirus backbone), 2 binding antibody ELISAs (full length S in prefusion-stabilised conformation 
(Nexelis) and RBD (BIDMC)) and a T cell assay (IFN-γ ELISpot) were used for samples obtained in all 
three studies. Also, the same assay was used to determine viral load in BAL and nasal swabs (RT-qPCR 
of SARS-CoV-2 E gene subgenomic ribonucleic acid (sgRNA).  
Two logistic regression analyses were made independently: one dataset consisted of all vaccine 
candidates combined (N=51) and a second dataset containing only the Ad26.COV2.S candidate 
(N=26).  
Based on the data generated with the final vaccine candidate, derived from studies NHP 20-09 and 20-
14, the dose dependent increases in humoral immune responses correlate with protection from 
infection, especially in the URT. Since dosing-down still offered protection from LRT infection, with only 
2 vaccinated animals showing viral replication in the lungs (1 each in the two lowest dose groups), this 
comes with less precision of the logistic regression models for lung viral load. Correlation between tests

assessing neutralising and binding antibodies has been demonstrated, and correlation of those markers 
with viral load is confirmed when the latter is expressed as a continuous instead of a binary variable. 
Binding antibody titers appeared to have a higher discriminatory capacity than neutralising antibodies. 
Neutralising antibody levels had the highest discriminatory capacity across all vaccine candidates 
combined from all studies. When comparing the overall analysis of all candidates to the analysis with 
the final candidate only, a correlation of T cell responses to protection was only shown in the latter. 
However, although a dose response relationship is indeed identified for the final vaccine candidate, it 
should be clear that the responses are not higher than those seen for other candidates in study NHP 
20-07. 
For the logistic regression analysis of all candidates, it should be noted that interpretation of those 
results is less straightforward, especially because the final candidate was not part of study 20-07, and 
it also builds on the assumption that the immune responses induced by the different candidates are 
qualitatively similar. For the logistic regression analysis of the final candidate only, as indicated above, 
precision of this logistic regression model is low for the lung as dose titration did not lead to the 
expected reduced LRT viral load. Both strategies are therefore considered complimentary, but these 
limitations may influence the weight that should be attributed to the outcome of the logistic regression 
analysis. However, the models have not been used to determine a threshold to apply to human data 
sets, which would probably require more robustness and further justification of the relevance of the 
animal model of infection, not disease. No unfounded claims have been made. The overall conclusion is 
supported: binding and neutralising antibody titers observed 4 weeks after immunisation with a single 
dose correlate with protection from infection in LRT and URT, when challenged in the short term.  
A passive transfer experiment in this NHP model shows that convalescent plasma dose-dependently 
protects from infection, indicating that humoral response induced after infection is sufficient for 
protection (McMahan et al.). Ad26 vaccine-induced neutralising or binding antibodies could thus be 
mechanistically involved in protection but it remains to be determined if vaccine-induced humoral 
response is sufficient for protection or alternatively that antibodies could also act as surrogate of the 
actual protective effector mechanisms that may well be multifactorial. 
Further evidence on the type of T cell response induced by vaccination was provided through a 
publication by Solforosi et al. (not peer reviewed). In this publication, a Th1 response was 
characterised by CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing IFN-γ and/or IL-2 and not IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL13 and 
a Th2 response was characterised by CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13. Th1 
skewing of the immune response is demonstrated in aged monkeys. Animals vaccinated with alum 
adjuvanted spike protein also induced comparable levels of antigen specific Th1 cells, but unlike the 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, activation of Th2 cells likely occurred. A similar intracellular cytokine staining 
was used for human samples from the phase I/IIa clinical trial, equally demonstrating Th1 skewing of 
the immune response (Sadoff et al. 2020). In addition, this publication describes that immune 
response and protection from challenge have been demonstrated in aged monkeys. These data 
support earlier studies, NHP 20-09 and NHP 20-14, with demonstration of protection in lower 
respiratory tract. It should be noted that in contrast to previous NHP studies, the G614 SARS-CoV-2 
challenge strain was used. In study NHP 20-14 a dose response relationship was shown for protection 
from infection in upper respiratory tract. In the current study, only a partial protection of the URT was 
observed in the vaccinated animals. The applicant suggested that several factors may have contributed 
to this finding, like age of the animals, time of the challenge and the strain used. A detailed 
assessment, in absence of a study report, is not possible at this stage but increase in temperature and 
signs of interstitial pneumonia in aged monkeys from the unvaccinated control group indicate that 
older age is associated with a more severe disease compared to what was observed in control animals 
in previous studies in young adults.

Preliminary results of an ongoing durability challenge study in NHPs [study NHP 2020-3373 (TV-TEC-
179493)] are publicly available (Roozendaal et al., not peer reviewed). The applicant analysed whether 
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S provides protection in macaques 6 months after the first vaccination, 
and whether the degree of protection could have been anticipated based on the derived correlates of 
protection, as described above (Logistic regression models; based on data from studies NHP 20-07, 09 
and 14). Groups of 7 macaques were vaccinated with either a one-dose (5x1010 vp or 1x1011 vp) or 
two-dose regimen (5x1010 vp/dose) of Ad26.COV2.S with either a 4-week or an 8-week interval 
between doses. 
Although there is not much detail, the protection conferred by one or 2 immunisations seems to last 
for at least 6 months after the first immunisation, as shown by the antibody titers and the viral loads 
measured in the BALs. The presence of replicating virus was measured in the noses of vaccinated 
animals at similar levels than in controls, however animals receiving two administrations of the vaccine 
8 weeks apart had significantly lower loads compared to the controls even though replicating virus is 
still measured as well in that group. 
There is good agreement between the observed protection 6 months after vaccination with the 
predicted protection probability in the lung based on both pre-challenge binding and neutralising 
antibody levels and correlate of protection models. In the nose, the predicted levels were above those 
actually measured. Thus, the predictions for the probability of protection in the lower airways based on 
binding and neutralising antibody levels is more robust than that for the protection in the upper 
respiratory tract. These findings are considered supportive.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies on the secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed, which is in accordance with 
applicable guidelines. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies have not been performed with Ad26.COV2.S, since data (e.g., detailed 
clinical observations) from repeat-dose toxicity studies with Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26-based 
vaccines did not suggest that these vaccines have a significant impact on physiological functions (e.g., 
central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular functions) other than those of the immune 
system. Therefore, and in line with the WHO guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines, stand-
alone safety pharmacology studies are not deemed necessary.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed, which is in accordance with 
applicable guidelines. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Biodistribution studies were not performed with this specific COV2.S construct as formerly discussed 
and agreed during the scientific advices undertaken by the applicant.  
The biodistribution profile of the Ad26 vector platform was evaluated in the rabbit using two Ad26-
based vaccines encoding other antigens than the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 50/218 
 
 
 
In these biodistribution studies, one Ad26-based was administered at a dose of 5x1010 virus particles 
[vp], with animals sacrificed at Days 11, 61, or 91 following single IM injection, whereas for a second 
Ad26-based vaccine the animals received a dose of 1x1011 vp, with animals sacrificed on Days 11, 90, 
120 or 180 following single IM injection of the vaccine. 
Tissues from these animals were harvested for analysis of Ad26 vector DNA using a quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) assay.  
The results from both biodistribution studies show that the replication incompetent Ad26 vector does 
not widely distribute following IM administration in the animals. Vector DNA was primarily detected at 
the site of injection, draining lymph nodes and (to a lesser extent) the spleen. From these tissues, 
Ad26 DNA diminished slowly, with a small amount remaining in iliac lymph node of 1 animal at 180 
days. In one of the studies, the vector DNA was below limit of detection in all other organs. 
Considering the removal of regions in the genome necessary for replication and the results of the two 
distribution studies performed with Ad26 platform, it is considered unlikely that the vector will replicate 
in human tissues. Notably, no biodistribution in gonads (ovaries and testes) was detected. 
In addition, both Ad26-based vaccines tested in the biodistribution studies showed a similar pattern of 
(systemic) distribution and clearance when delivered via the IM route in the rabbit, despite carrying 
different transgene inserts. The Ad26 vector backbone used for Ad26.COV2.S is identical to the vector 
backbone of the Ad26-based vaccines that were tested in the available biodistribution studies. The only 
difference between the vectors, apart from the encoded antigen transgene, is the insertion of a 
tetracycline operon (TetO) motif in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter sequence of the transgene 
expression cassette of Ad26.COV2.S. This is not considered to impact the biodistribution profile of the 
Ad26 vector.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety profile of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been assessed in two pivotal toxicology 
studies in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits, a combined repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance 
study, and a combined embryo-foetal and pre- and postnatal development (EF-PPND) toxicity study.

Vaccine

Repeat dose toxicity 
A specific GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S (study 
TOX14382) was conducted in male and female NZW rabbits to evaluate its toxicity and to assess the 
potential reversibility, persistence or delayed occurrence of any findings 3 weeks after the last 
vaccination. The rabbits were injected IM with a control solution (0.9% sodium chloride) or 1×1011 vp 
Ad26.COV2.S on three occasions with a 14-day interval period (Days 1, 15 and 29). This dose and 
interval encompass the actual clinical dose and schedule, which is acceptable. The rabbit was also 
demonstrated to elicit an immune response to the antigen contained in the vector, which qualifies this 
species for the safety assessment of the present vaccine. 
Ad26.COV2.S administered on three occasions every 2 weeks at 1x1011 vp/dose induced a transient 
inflammation consistent with an immunologic response to vaccination, i.e.: minimal hyperthermia and 
minimal body weight loss or lower body weight gain after injection, increases in plasma proteins (CRP, 
fibrinogen and globulins) and white blood cell counts (monocytes and lymphocytes).  
Microscopic pathology findings showed increased lymphoid cellularity of germinal centers in popliteal 
and iliac lymph nodes and the spleen, also consistent with an immune response to the vaccine. Overall, 
the findings were considered non-adverse and were partially or completely reversible after a 3-week 
treatment-free period.  
The local changes consisted of transient local injection site dermal reactions associated with minimal to 
slight and reversible inflammation and haemorrhage at the injection site. 
In conclusion, the repeat dose toxicity and local tolerance study did not highlight any unexpected 
findings. Those were mild, transient and as expected from a local/general inflammatory reaction 
subsequent to vaccination. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were carried out, in line with relevant guidelines. Studies 
evaluating genotoxicity and carcinogenicity are normally not required for viral vaccines. Since no 
adjuvants or novel excipients are used in this product, absence of those studies is considered 
acceptable.  
As regard Ad26 vector and its integration ability in nature, wild type adenoviruses do not integrate 
their genomes into the host cell chromosomes. With a few exceptions they replicate as linear, extra-
chromosomal DNA (episomic) elements in the nucleus. The guideline on non-clinical testing for 
inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer vectors EMEA/273974/2005 indicates that 
adenoviruses have traditionally been regarded as non-integrating. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A GLP-compliant EF-PPND toxicity study (study TOX14389) was conducted in female NZW rabbits that 
received Ad26.COV2.S intramuscularly on Day 1 (i.e., 7 days prior to mating), followed by two 
vaccinations during the gestation period (i.e. GD 6, and GD 20). The design of this study was 
discussed with CHMP and considered appropriate.  
The rabbit is an acceptable model for developmental toxicity studies, and the dosing strategy ensures 
induction of a maternal immune response during mating and early gestation, evaluation of potential 
direct embryotoxic effects of the components of the vaccine formulation and the (direct) effects of the 
vaccine during late gestation, and a sustained maternal immune response up to lactation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 52/218 
 
 
 
There were no adverse effects of treatment on survival, clinical observations, body weight, body weight 
change, food consumption, reproductive performance, fertility, ovarian and uterine examinations, 
parturition, or macroscopic evaluations in parental females.  
No adverse effect of treatment was seen on foetal body weights, external, visceral, and skeletal 
evaluations on GD 29, or F1 kit evaluations from LD 0-28 (sex ratios, survival, body weights, clinical 
findings, developmental evaluations, and macroscopic evaluations). 
The assay used for immunogenicity is a qualified SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA. All immunised animals and 
their foetuses had high SARS-CoV-2.S protein-specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal 
antibodies were transferred to the foetuses. While antibody titers of foetuses were comparable to that 
in the does, titers in kits (measured on LD28) were 1.3-fold lower. 
In conclusion, the reproductive and developmental toxicity study did not reveal any evidence of 
impaired female fertility and did not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, while 
exposure of dams and offspring was confirmed by detection of antibody in ELISA. 
Previous studies submitted with Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine in the rabbit did not highlight significant 
treatment related effects on reproduction or on F0 or F1 animals after administration 8 days prior to 
mating and at GD6.  
Local Tolerance  
No stand-alone local tolerance studies were submitted. This is acceptable and in line with relevant 
guidance on non-clinical vaccine development since local tolerance was evaluated in a repeated dose 
toxicity study.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ad26.COVS.2 is a recombinant Adenovirus26 that has been rendered replication-incompetent by 
deletion of the E1 region of the wildtype Ad26. Ad26.COVS.2 is produced in an E1 complementing cell 
line, without any DNA sequence overlap between the Ad26.COV.S vector and the cell line, thereby 
precluding the formation of replication competent adenovirus (RCA). RCA testing of drug substance DS 
was conducted for several small- and large-scale processes and the results complied with the 
acceptance criteria specifications.  
Both the non-replicative nature and the anticipated biodistribution profile upon intramuscular injection 
of Ad26COVS.2 is assumed to minimise co-infection events with wild-type adenoviruses, E1-
complementing viruses or coronaviruses. An assessment of the effect and likelihood of recombination 
events concludes that resulting recombinants would either be non-replicative or will have no increased 
risk profile as compared to the circulating wild-type viruses that are present in the individual at the 
time of co-infection. While it is anticipated that exposure of unintended individuals to Ad26COVS.2 will 
be several orders of magnitude lower as compared to the dose administered for vaccination, results 
obtained with clinical trials completed so far indicate good tolerability and reveal no particular safety 
concerns distinct from other Ad26-based vaccines.   
Risk management strategies  
Even though the overall risk of Ad26.COVS.2 is deemed negligible, measures have been taken by the 
applicant to minimise the likelihood of spread in the environment or to non-target individuals. 
The SmPC gives some guidance in relation to protection of personnel during handling and 
administration, including disinfection of accidental spills in section 6.6: “Potential spills should be 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 53/218 
 
 
 
disinfected with agents with viricidal activity against adenovirus”. Since the environmental risks of 
Ad26.COVS.2 are negligible, the inclusion of additional risk management strategies for reasons of 
environmental safety and safety of non-target individuals is not necessary.  
The overall risk for human (non-vaccinated individuals) and the environment under the proposed 
conditions of release of Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen is negligible. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Ad26.COV2.S is an adenoviral vector that encodes a modified variant of the S protein that is stabilised 
in its prefusion conformation. This vaccine construct was shown to induce superior immunogenicity in 
mice, Syrian hamsters, and non-human primates and protection following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in 
NHPs and hamsters compared to other vaccine candidates explored by the applicant.  
Immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was tested in mice, rabbits, Syrian hamsters, and NHP. 
The vaccine elicits a dose-dependent binding and neutralising antibody response in the species tested 
and additionally induces a cellular immune response in mice, rabbits, and NHP, which is rather low and 
variable. The applicant showed that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine elicited a Th1 skewed immune response 
in mice and NHP.  
The high level of genetic homology between NHP and humans, and their comparative immunology 
make NHP a suitable model for studies of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy studies. The Syrian 
hamsters were selected as they are described as permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and display 
widespread lung pathology and clinical signs including weight loss. In contrast to the NHP model, 
shown to be an infection model but not suitable to demonstrate protection from disease, the hamster 
model shows more severe disease (Muñoz-Fontela, C. et al., 2020).  
Challenge studies performed in NHPs have shown reduced viral load in the upper and lower respiratory 
tracts in vaccinated animals compared to controls. The NHP challenge model was considered adequate 
to demonstrate immunogenicity, and viral clearance, but appears insufficient to demonstrate efficacy 
against the disease. In a titration study in NHPs, a dose-dependent humoral immune response was 
demonstrated. While protection from infection in the lower respiratory tract was observed with little 
breakthrough cases even in the low dose groups, viral load in the upper respiratory tract was dose 
dependent. Preliminary results of an immunogenicity and efficacy study in aged NHP (VH808.681) 
have been provided through a manuscript (Solforosi et al.) and indicate that immune responses 
induced by Ad26.COV2.S vaccination confer protection in older animals. Finally, preliminary data from 
an ongoing durability study indicate that the immune response lasts for at least six months and confers 
protection to lower respiratory tract infection (Roozendaal et al.).  
It seems that prior immunisation of NHPs confers protection more in the lower respiratory tracts 
compared to upper tracts 6 months after the first administration of the vaccine. Protection from upper 
respiratory tract infection was high shortly after vaccination of adult NHPs with high doses of 
Ad26.COV2.S (NHP 20-09). However, the titration study (NHP 20-14) with a dose level-dependent 
protection of URT suggested that protection in the upper respiratory tract may require higher vaccine 
doses offering a higher level of systemic immune response, compared to protection from LRT viral 
replication. Another study in older NHPs has also only shown partial protection of URT infection. In this 
new duration study, with only a small subsets of animals protected from URT viral replication, the 
applicant suggested that systemic binding and neutralising antibody levels likely are associated with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 54/218 
 
 
 
 
distinct mechanistic correlate of protection in the nose early after vaccination, rather than being a 
mechanistic correlate of protection themselves.  
The applicant complemented the non-clinical package with two humoral immunogenicity and challenge 
studies in a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster challenge model. Ad26.COV2.S significantly reduced viral load 
in the lung and lower histopathological scores compared with mock vaccinated controls. However, the 
difference was less apparent in the upper respiratory tract where viral load and histopathological 
findings were not very different from unvaccinated animals. Like the experiments in the NHPs, the low 
challenge dose conferred rather mild pneumonia without any clinical signs in the unvaccinated control 
animals, apart from body weight loss in hamsters.  
Data from a dose level titration study performed in hamsters showed dose level-dependent reduction 
of efficacy and partial breakthrough infection in the lower respiratory tract at lower dose levels. The 
protection of vaccination against weight loss was not really apparent in the 2 experiments reported 
here, however, some beneficial effects of Ad26.COV2.S on weight loss were noted in a study by 
Tostanoski et al. using a more stringent SARS-CoV-2 challenge dose, demonstrating significant 
protection when the body weight loss is severe. 
It is additionally considered that the theoretical risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated enhanced 
respiratory disease (VAERD) has been sufficiently addressed by the applicant. The structure of the 
Spike coded by the vector stabilised in its prefusion conformation, the Th1 skewing of the immune 
response confirmed in mice, NHPs and rabbits as well as the absence VAERD noted in the challenge 
studies based on assessments of lung histopathology and absence of signs of clinical disease contribute 
to conclude that this risk is low.  
In both animal models, two different challenge strains were used, D614 which is related to the one 
expressed by the vaccine vector, and a G614 variant with higher infectivity. Protection from infection 
by emerging strains of interest will be addressed by assessing neutralising potential of clinical samples.  
Finally, the applicant showed that in both Syrian hamsters and NHP, the binding and neutralising 
antibodies elicited by Ad26.COV2.S correlated with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as 
measured by viral load in the respiratory tracts. Because immunogenicity and efficacy data are 
available from clinical studies, these non-clinical data are for the most part superseded and considered 
supportive of this application. 
No assessment of a potential immune response toward the vector in itself was provided. Taking into 
account the available non-clinical and clinical platform data, as well as of clinical Ad26.COV2.S-specific 
data, the absence of non-clinical insert-specific vector immunity data is considered acceptable and 
sufficiently justified.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The biodistribution profile of the Ad26 vector platform was evaluated in the rabbit using two other 
Ad26 based vaccines. These platform biodistribution data are considered sufficient to inform on the 
biodistribution profile of Ad26.COV2.S, for which the same (replication incompetent) Ad26 vector 
backbone is used. This position has been confirmed and agreed in a previous Scientific Advice by EMA 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/369281/2020, dated 9 July 2020). It is further noted that the same platform 
biodistribution data were part of the MAA file for the Ebola vaccine component Ad26, Zabdeno 
(EU/1/20/1444/001). 
The Ad26 vector shows a limited distribution profile following IM injection, with detection at the site of 
injection, draining lymph nodes and (to a lesser extent) the spleen. Clearance (reflected by a 
downward trend in number of positive tissues and vector copies over time, to levels close to, or below 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 55/218 
 
 
 
the detection limit of the q-PCR methods used) of the Ad26 vector was observed, indicating that the 
vector does not replicate and/or persist in the tissues following IM injection.  
Dissemination of Ad26 vector into breast milk or to/across the placenta has not been specifically 
assessed in these non-clinical biodistribution studies. Even if a small quantity was excreted via the 
milk, it would not be considered as a risk, since Ad26.COV2.S is a non-replicating vaccine and does not 
encode a complete virus.  
Studies on absorption, metabolism and excretion were not performed, which is in accordance with the 
WHO Guidelines on the Nonclinical Evaluation of Vaccines. 
Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety profile of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been assessed in two pivotal toxicology 
studies in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits, a combined repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance 
study, and a combined embryo-foetal and pre- and postnatal development (EF-PPND) toxicity study.  
Overall, the repeat dose toxicity and local tolerance study did not highlight any unexpected findings. 
Those were mild, transient and as expected from local/general inflammatory reaction subsequent to 
vaccination. It also did not reveal any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility. 
Female reproductive toxicity and fertility were assessed in a combined embryo-foetal and pre- and 
post-natal development study in the rabbit. In this study, a first vaccination of COVID-19 Vaccine 
Janssen was administered intramuscularly to female rabbits 7 days prior to mating, at a dose 
equivalent to 2-fold above the recommended human dose, followed by two vaccinations at the same 
dose during the gestation period (i.e., at gestational days 6 and 20).  
This EF-PPND toxicity study did not reveal any vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or 
embryo-foetal or offspring development. The parental females as well as their foetuses and offspring 
exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal antibodies were 
transferred to the foetuses during gestation. No COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen data are available on 
vaccine excretion in milk. 
Dedicated male fertility studies are not routinely required for vaccines, and this is considered 
acceptable in this case as no concerns were raised in repeat dose toxicity study and biodistribution 
studies. Absence of juvenile animal studies is also acceptable since no target organs of toxicity have 
been identified. 
Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine are 
not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
Overall, the toxicology studies were adequate and in accordance with the WHO guidelines on non-
clinical evaluation of vaccines and scientific advice. The vaccine-related effects noted were considered 
to reflect a normal, immunologic response consistent with vaccination. The nonclinical safety profile of 
Ad26.COV2.S is largely similar to the profile observed previously for other Ad26-based vaccines.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major non-clinical issues are identified in this application. A range of other concerns identified have 
been properly addressed by the applicant.  
The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The trials performed by the applicant are still ongoing and all are randomised, placebo-controlled, and 
conducted in a double-blind fashion. The first-in-human VAC31518COV1001 is a Phase 1/2a to 
evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S at 2 dose levels (5×1010 vp 
and 1×1011 vp). The data from this study supported the enrolment in the pivotal study 
VAC31518COV3001. A Phase 1 trial VAC31518COV1002 evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of 
Ad26.COV2.S. VAC31518COV2001 is a Phase 2a trial conducted in three EU countries to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. Two Phase 3 trials, VAC31518COV3001 and 
VAC31518COV3009, evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults aged 
≥18 years living in or going to locations with high risk for acquisition of Ad26.COV2.S infection. 
This report presents the primary efficacy and safety analysis from study VAC31518COV3001, which 
was performed once the required 2-month median follow-up was reached (reached on 22 January 
2021). In addition, interim immunogenicity and safety analyses from studies VAC31518COV2001, 
VAC31518COV1002 and VAC31518COV1001 are presented, as well as preliminary immunogenicity 
analysis for VAC31518COV3001.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
According to the Guideline on clinical evaluation of new vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005), 
pharmacokinetic studies are usually not requested for vaccines. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics relates to investigation of immunogenicity.  
There is no established immunological correlates of protection (ICP) against COVID-19. Both the 
humoral and cellular immune responses are thought to be involved in the protection against COVID-
19, but their respective contribution in the protection or in the progression to/susceptibility of disease, 
and severe disease, are still poorly understood. 
Binding and neutralising antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S vaccination correlate with 
protection as demonstrated in NHP and Syrian hamster challenge studies. 
Mechanism of action 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, 
replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike 
(S) glycoprotein in a stabilised conformation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS-
CoV-2 is transiently expressed, stimulating both neutralising and other functional S-specific antibodies, 
as well as cellular immune responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to 
protection against COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity studies 
The immunogenicity data available so far were generated from a Phase 1/2a FIH trial conducted in 
Belgium and in the US (VAC31518COV1001), a Phase 1 trial conducted in Japan (VAC31518COV1002), 
a Phase 2 trial conducted in Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, UK (VAC31518COV2001), and one of 
the Phase 3 trials (VAC31518COV3001). No immunogenicity results are available for the second 
ongoing VAC31518COV3009 Phase 3 trial. Data from all trials are interim results. 
Both the immunogenicity assays and the studies (design and results) are discussed in the next sub-
sections. 
Assays used to evaluate immunogenicity 
Depending on the study, the main immunogenicity objectives of the ongoing studies are to assess 
humoral immune responses in terms of neutralising antibodies, measured by wtVNA, and of S-specific 
binding antibodies, measured by S-ELISA, as well as to assess cellular immune responses, measured 
by ICS and/or ELISpot. In VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV1002 studies, and in participants at 
selected sites in study VAC31518COV3001, the presence of neutralising antibodies to the Ad26 vector 
backbone was measured using the Ad26 VNA. Additional antibody functionality has been investigated 
by means of ADCP. An SARS-CoV-2 N-ELISA was used for the detection of asymptomatic infection. 
Timepoints for blood samples were variable across studies. Samples were taken at baseline and 28 
days post-vaccination. Additional samples were also taken, including at days 14, 56, 70, or 85 days as

well as 6 and 12-14 months post-first vaccination in the VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV2001 
study studies.

Immunogenicity evaluation 
Venous blood samples are to be collected at baseline, at 14, 28, 56 (vaccination 2), 70, 84 days post-
dose 1, and at months 6 and 12 post-dose 2 for the assessment of humoral and cellular immune 
responses. 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 
FAS: The full analysis set will include all participants with at least one vaccine administration 
documented. 
PPI: The per protocol immunogenicity population will include all randomised and vaccinated 
participants for whom immunogenicity data are available excluding participants with major protocol 
deviations expecting to impact the immunogenicity outcomes.  
Analysis of the immunogenicity results was based on the per protocol immunogenicity population 
(Cohort 1a) or the full analysis set (Cohort 3), consisting of all randomised and vaccinated participants 
for whom immunogenicity data were available. 
Cohort 1a (Adults aged ≥18-≤55 years) 
The data provided by the applicant are the following: 
•  SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and S protein binding antibodies at baseline and Days 29, 
57, 71 and 85. 
•  Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline and Day 57. 
•  ADCP and T cell responses (ICS) at baseline, Day 15 and Day 29. 
• 
IFNɣ and IL-4 responses (ELISpot) at baseline and Day 15. 
(i) Humoral responses  
Neutralising Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2: 
Neutralising antibodies to wt SARS-CoV-2 were measured in a wtVNA assay. Samples of 25 participants 
(random subset) per group were analysed. 
Fifteen participants in Cohort 1a were SARS CoV-2 seropositive at baseline and only one of these was in 
the  subset  of  125  participants  analyzed  by  wtVNA.  Detectable  levels  of  neutralising  antibodies  were 
observed in a minority of participants at baseline. 
Descriptive  statistics  of  the  actual  values  (GMTs  with  corresponding  95%  CIs)  and  percentage  of 
responders over time are provided by vaccination group in the Table below.

Binding antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were measured by ELISA. Samples of 75 participants 
per group were analysed.  
Out of the 15 participants in Cohort 1a were SARS  CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, 2 were defined as 
seropositive by screening serology alone, being negative by baseline S-ELISA. 
Descriptive statistics of the actual values (GMTs with corresponding 95% CIs) and percentage of positive 
samples over time are provided by vaccination group in the Table below.

Neutralising antibody titers correlated highly with binding antibody concentrations at Day 29 and Day 
71. The Spearman correlation at both timepoints was >0.80.

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike antigen was measured by an 
ADCP assay. Samples of 75 participants per group were analysed. 
Figure 4. SARS-CoV-2 S-ADCP (phagocytic score) 
Correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between ADCP (phagocytic score) and 
neutralising antibody titers (IC50), with a Spearman correlation of 0.75. A strong positive correlation 
between phagocytic score and binding antibody titers (EU/mL) was also demonstrated (Spearman 
correlation =0.856). 
Pre-existing immunity and Responses to Ad26 Backbone: 
Neutralising antibodies to the Ad26 backbone vector were measured using the Ad26 VNA at baseline 
and prior to second vaccination on Day 57. 
Four participants had pre-existing levels of Ad26-neutralising antibodies ≥LLOQ. 
At Day 57 Ad26-neutralising antibodies ≥LLOQ were detected in more than 95% of participants in the 
active vaccine groups, compared to 9% of those in the PL, PL group.  
Correlation analysis of Ad26 neutralising antibodies pre-dose 2 vs. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies 
post-dose 2 showed a poor correlation between the two variables (r=-0.25 at Day 71 and r=-0.29 at 
Day 85). 
Neutralising Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage (variant 20I/501Y.V1): 
Neutralising antibodies capable of inhibiting live virus infections by the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage 
(variant 20I/501Y.V1) were assessed in samples of Cohort 1a as part of the exploratory analyses with 
a non-qualified assay. No LLOQ was determined and no responder definition is applied. Neutralising 
antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 are expressed as IC50 units. 
Samples from VAC31518COV1001 Cohort 1a were selected for the measurement of neutralising 
antibodies directed against the B.1.1.7 lineage. In particular, samples showing high titers in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 72/218 
 
 
 
 
 
Victoria/1/2020 wtVNA were selected 28 days post-dose 1 (Day 29, n=8), 70 days post-dose 1 (i.e. 14 
days post-dose 2, Day 71, n=24).  
Neutralising antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.17 were detectable in all samples from the active 
groups, while all placebo samples were below detection. 
For the 6 Day 29-samples of the 5×1010 vp, PL group, nAb GMT observed in the Victoria 1/2020 VNA 
was 573 (95% CI: 268-1,226) whereas the GMT observed in the B.1.1.7 lineage VNA was 65 (95% CI: 
30-141). 
For the 14 Day 71-samples of the 5×1010 vp, PL group, nAb GMT observed in the Victoria 1/2020 VNA 
was 375 (95% CI: 271-519) whereas the GMT observed in the B.1.1.7 lineage VNA was 113 (95% CI: 
82-155). 
For the 6 Day 71-samples of the 5×1010, 5×1010 vp group, nAb GMT observed in the Victoria 1/2020 
VNA was 1,656 (95% CI: 1,046-2,622) whereas the GMT observed in the B.1.1.7 lineage VNA was 398 
(95% CI: 282-561). 
(ii) Cellular immune responses 
CD4+ T and CD8+ T-cell Responses by ICS: 
The induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses was determined by ICS at baseline, Day 15 and Day 
29 post-dose 1.  
PBMCs were collected from a subset of participants for this analysis (n=196). 
Profiles for CD4+ T cells expressing IFNγ and/or IL-2 (Th1), but not Th2 cytokines, and CD8+ T cells 
expressing IFNγ and/or IL-2 in response to SARS-CoV-2 S peptide stimulation are presented below. 
Median CD4+ Th2 (CD4+ T cells expressing IL-4 and/or IL-5/IL-13 and CD40L) responses were 
undetectable at Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29 in all vaccine groups. 
The Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1 for all participants in the active vaccine groups.

IFN-γ and IL-4 Responses by ELISpot: 
Th1 and Th2 phenotypes were characterised by IFNγ and IL-4 ELISpot quantification, respectively, in 
375 subjects. ELISpot results confirmed the results observed by the ICS method, an induction of Th1 
cells responses in most of the vaccinated subjects, and overall comparable between groups. 
The Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1 for all participants in the active vaccine groups. 
Cohort 3 (Adults aged ≥65 years) 
The data provided by the applicant are the same as for Cohort 1a, with some differences on the days at 
which some of the blood draws have been carried out. There are no immunogenicity data post-dose 2 
except for the sentinel participants.  
When interpreting the Day 57 results from Cohort 3, it is important to note that, due to the study pause, 
Day 57 blood draws for immunogenicity were delayed for the majority of participants. Data within the 
defined per protocol Day 57 visit window (57 ±3-7 days post vaccination) are available for 15 participants 
only (n=3 per group). For the remaining participants, the actual timing of the Day 57 blood draw ranged 
from  86  to  107  days  post-vaccination  (median  visit  =  Day  87).  Therefore,  data  presented  below  for 
Cohort 3 are based on the FAS instead of the PPI set, ie, including data from participants out of window 
for the Day 57 blood samples.  
(i) Humoral responses  
Neutralising Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2: 
Samples of 25 participants per group were analysed.

Correlation analysis demonstrated a high correlation between ADCP (phagocytic score) and neutralising 
antibody titers (IC50), with a Spearman correlation of 0.72. A strong correlation between phagocytic 
score and binding antibody titers (EU/mL) was also demonstrated (Spearman correlation =0.80). 
Pre-existing immunity to Ad26 Backbone: 
Of the Cohort 3 participants, 23 had pre-existing levels of Ad26-neutralising antibodies. 
(ii) Cellular immune responses 
CD4+ T and CD8+ T-cell Responses by ICS: 
PBMCs were collected from a subset of 200 participants for analysis of cellular immune responses 
(n=40 per group). 
CD4 Th1 cells were detected at Day 15 and the proportion of positive samples slightly increase up to 
28 days post-vaccination. At Day 15, the proportion of positive samples ranged from 59% to 63% and 
from 63% to 74% at Day 29. Median responses were also comparable between groups at Day 15 
(0.07%-0.09%) and remained stable up to Day 29 (0.09%-0.10%). 
Median Th2 responses were undetectable at Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29 in all vaccine groups. 
The Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1 for all participants in the active vaccine groups. 
CD8 Th1 cells were detected at Day 15 and their proportion further increased up to 28 days post-
vaccination. Proportion of positive samples ranged between 49% and 65% at Day 29. Median 
responses ranged between 0.06% and 0.11%. 
Regression Analyses of Antibody Responses on Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 77/218 
 
 
 
 
 
The effect of demographic and baseline characteristics on both neutralising and binding antibody 
responses was examined on pooled data from Cohort 1a and Cohort 3 at Day 29 (n=198 and 598 for 
nAb and binding Ab, respectively), and on data from Cohort 1a at Day 57 and Day 71 (n=98 and 
n=278 for nAb and binding Ab, respectively). A p-value of <0.05 was taken to indicate a statistically 
significant effect. However, it should be noted that neutralising and binding antibody responses were 
observed in all subgroups and that the assessment of the clinical relevance of the observed differences 
between subgroups is difficult. 
No statistically significant differences in neutralising and antibody responses were observed for race or 
BMI. Males mounted significantly lower nAb and binding Ab responses than females. 
Age did not significantly impact nAb levels at any timepoint whereas older participants showed lower 
levels of binding Ab at Day 29 and Day 57 timepoints. At Day 71, no impact of age was observed on 
neutralising or binding antibody responses based on the regression analysis. However, when 
comparing neutralising antibody response in Cohort 1a and Cohort 3, a trend for decreased 
neutralising antibody response (GMTs) was observed in participants ≥65 years old compared to 18-55-
year-old participants at Day 57. 
Baseline SARS-CoV-2 serostatus also significantly impacted levels of neutralising and binding Ab at all 
3 timepoints (with the exception of Day 71 for the binding Ab). This should be interpreted with caution 
since there were only a small number of baseline seropositive participants. However, this is not 
counter-intuitive. 
Ad26.COV2.S dose level did not significantly impacted levels of nAb whereas it did for binding Ab at all 
3 timepoints. As expected, number of administered active vaccine doses had a highly significant impact 
on both neutralising and binding Ab levels. 
2.4.3.1.2.  Study VAC31518COV1002 
Immunogenicity evaluation 
Venous blood samples were/are to be collected for determination of immune responses in Cohorts 1 
and 2 at pre-specified timepoints (14- and 28-days post-dose 1, prior dose 2, 14- and 28-days post-
dose 2, 6 months post-dose 2 and 12 months post-dose 1. 
The data on SARS-COV-2 and Ad26 nAb for Cohort 1 were provided by the applicant. 
No formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. The immunogenicity analyses will be 
performed on the PPI population. Immunogenicity analyses will also be done on the FAS. 
Analysis of the immunogenicity results was based on the PPI population. Baseline and post-first 
vaccination immunogenicity results were provided in 5×1010 vp (n=51), 1×1011 vp (n=50) and placebo 
(n=24) groups, respectively. 
Humoral immunogenicity 
Neutralising Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2: 
Detectable baseline levels of SARS-CoV-2 IC50 titers, potentially indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 
exposure, were observed in 1 participant in the 5×1010 vp vaccine group, 6 participants in the 1×1011 
vp vaccine group. 
Descriptive statistics of the actual values and percentages of responders are provided by vaccine group 
in the table below x.

Pre-existing immunity to Ad26 Backbone: 
Detectable baseline levels of Ad26 nAb were observed in 4 out of 125 participants.  
2.4.3.1.3.  Study VAC31518COV2001 
In adults, the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in 1- and 2-dose vaccination regimens followed single 
low-dose immunisation after 4 months (2-dose regimen) or 6 months (single-dose regimen), will be 
evaluated across 4 dose levels and vaccination intervals (1x1011 vp, 5x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, and 
1.25x1010 vp).  
In adolescents, the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in a 1- and 2-dose vaccination regimen followed 
by a booster vaccination 12 months after the first vaccination, will be evaluated for 2 different dose 
levels (5x1010 vp or 2.5x1010 vp). The applicant did not presented results for the adolescents part of 
this CMA. 
Immunogenicity assessment 
Venous blood samples are to be collected at baseline, at 14 and 28 days post-dose 1, the day of the 
vaccination 2 (day 57), at 7, 14 and 28 days post-dose 2, the day of the third injection (antigen 
presentation), at 7 and 28 days post-dose 3, at 6 months post-dose 3 and 12 months post-dose 2 for 
the assessment of humoral and cellular immune responses.

Venous blood samples were collected for assessment of humoral immune responses in all participants 
whereas cellular immune responses will be assessed in a subset of adult participants. 
The data on SARS-COV-2 nAb were provided by the applicant. The immunogenicity analyses are 
descriptive and are performed on the PPI population. Immunogenicity analyses are also done on the 
FAS. 
Humoral immunogenicity 
Neutralising Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2: 
Wild-type VNA data was available from a subset of participants from Groups 1 – 6 (n=40 per vaccine 
groups, n= 15 for the Placebo group). Data from vaccine Groups 1 and 5 (5x1010 vp) were pooled. 
Table 9. SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation wtVNA 
A trend for lower positive sample rate, responder rate and GMTs was observed in subjects of 65 years 
of age and over, for all dose levels, when compared to the younger 18-55 years of age subjects. 
2.4.3.1.4.  Phase 3 study VAC31518COV3001 
This section focuses on the immunogenicity assessment. See section clinical efficacy, main study, for 
further study description. 
Blood is to be collected from all non-Immunogenicity Subset participants for humoral immunogenicity 
assessments at Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after vaccination. 
For a total of approximately 400 participants in the Immunogenicity Subset (i.e., participants at sites 
with access to appropriate processing facilities), blood samples are to be collected for analysis of 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

humoral immune responses on Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, 1 year as for the 
non-immunogenicity subset, and also at 18 months, and 2 years after vaccination. 
During a COVID-19-episode, blood is to be collected on COVID-19 Day 3-5 and on COVID-19 Day 29 
for immunogenicity assessments (for biomarker evaluation). 
A serologic test for past or current infection with SARS-CoV-2 is to be performed for all participants at 
Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after vaccination.

Correlates subset 
Correlates of risk of COVID-19 will be assessed in a subset including all vaccine recipients who 
experience a SARS-CoV-2 event, and random samples of vaccine recipients who have not been 
infected. Correlates of infection or disease/disease severity, or protection will also be investigated.  
No formal statistical testing of the immunogenicity data was planned. All immunogenicity analyses are 
to be performed on the PPI set.  
Changes in planned analyses 
As an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was observed during the study at specific Brazilian sites 
(sites BR10003, BR10004), there were concerns that regional differences in vaccine efficacy would be 
observed at the moment of the primary analysis. Evident reasons for these differences, outside of 
environmental, would be lower protection against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants and/or lower vaccine 
immunogenicity; therefore, the applicant decided to evaluate Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity by 
measuring S-specific binding antibodies at Day 1 and Day 29 post-vaccination in participants randomly 
selected from these sites as well as other random Brazilian sites, South African sites, and US sites. In 
addition, as seroprevalence of Ad26 is known to differ in different regions, an analysis of pre-existing 
Ad26 immunity, measured by Ad26 neutralising antibody titers at Day 1, was also performed to 
determine if there was a high prevalence of pre-existing Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline. All 
these analyses were planned and performed before the database lock. 
Humoral immunogenicity 
Binding Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2 S Protein: 
At the time of primary analysis, only preliminary immunogenicity data were available. Data that are 
presented are those of participants randomly selected from the two main Brazilian sites as well as 
other random Brazilian sites (n=188, different sites), South African sites (n=118), and US sites 
(n=74).

Pre-existing immunity to Ad26 Backbone: 
Ad26 nAb titers at baseline were measured for participants from Brazil and the US. Among the US 
participants, only 2.0% in the active vaccine group and 4.2% in the placebo group, were seropositive. 
Participants from Brazil had an overall Ad26 seroprevalence of 32.5% and 28.4% in the active vaccine 
group and placebo group, respectively. 
Among the 27 Brazilian participants with detectable Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline, 23 
(85.2% [95% CI: 66.3; 95.8]) were vaccine responders as measured by S-ELISA at Day 29. Among

the 59 Brazilian participants with no detectable Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline, 59 (100% 
[95% CI: 93.9; 100]) were vaccine responders as measured by S-ELISA at Day 29. A low negative 
correlation (Spearman correlation of -0.378) was observed between S binding antibody levels at Day 
29 post vaccination and pre-existing Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline. This is consistent with 
the overall comparable GMT values observed at D29 post-vaccination between the US site and the 
Brazilian sites. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
All interim immunogenicity data available were generated from a Phase 1/2a FIH trial, a Phase 1 trial, 
a Phase 2 trial, and a Phase 3 trial (VAC31518COV3001), up to 3 months post-dose 1. No 
immunogenicity results are available for the second ongoing VAC31518COV3009 Phase 3 trial. This is 
acceptable for the cMA, but longer follow-up data should be provided with final CSRs. 
Study VAC31518COV1001 is an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2a 
multicentre first-in-human (FIH) dose selection study conducted in adults aged ≥18 to ≤55 years 
(n=670) and aged ≥65 years (n=375) in Belgium and in the US. Based on platform experience, the 
dose levels of 5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp, both administered as a 1-dose and a 2-dose regimen, were 
selected. This study also includes an evaluation of a single booster vaccination. 
Study VAC31518COV1002 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial conducted in 
adults aged ≥20 to ≤55 years (n=125) and ≥65 years (n=125). Two dose levels were tested in a 2-
dose schedule in Japan.  
Study VAC31518COV2001 is an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre 
Phase 2a study conducted in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Adults aged 18 to 55 years, and 
adults in good or stable health aged 65 years and older are being enrolled (n=625). Immunogenicity of 
Ad26.COV2.S in 1- and 2-dose vaccination regimen will be evaluated across a range of dose levels and 
vaccination intervals. A single low-dose immunisation with 1.25x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S to mimic 
antigen presentation, will be administered 4 months after the second vaccination to all participants in 
all active vaccine groups to assess the immune memory. It is unclear why the anamnestic response 
will be assessed with a shorter interval between the primary vaccination and the antigen presentation 
for the 2-dose schedule when compared to the 1-dose schedule. This should be clarified by the 
applicant as soon as possible (see list of recommendations).  
The design of the 4 clinical trials are overall considered adequate for the characterisation of the immune 
responses induced following Ad26.COV2.S administration.  
In addition, Ad26.COV2.S-induced immune responses will be assessed in a subset of participants of study 
VAC31518COV3001 (see efficacy section for further details on the design).  
Overall, the main immunogenicity objectives consisted in the assessment of humoral (neutralising and 
binding Ab) and cellular (Th1, Th2) immune responses, which are both thought to be involved in the 
protection against COVID-19. Their respective contribution in the protection or in the progression 
to/susceptibility of disease, and severe disease, is still poorly understood.  
Timepoints for blood samples were variable across studies. Samples were taken at baseline and 28 
days post-vaccination. Additional samples were also taken, among others, at days 14, 56, 70, or 84 
days post-first vaccination in the VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV2001 study studies. Blood will 
also be taken at later time-point, i.e. at months 6 and 12 post-dose 1/2. Sampling schedules are 
appropriate to determine the kinetic of the immune responses. The immunogenicity analyses are

descriptive and were performed on the PPI population, or on random subset of participants (VNA 
analysis) or on an immunogenicity set of participants at selected sites in VAC31518COV3001. 
The assays used include measure of the humoral response to the S protein in terms of binding 
antibodies (by ELISA), functional antibodies (Virus neutralisation assay, Antibody-Dependent 
Phagocytosis Assay to measure Fc-mediated viral clearance), and neutralising antibodies against the 
Ad26 vector. Moreover, the cellular immune response (CD4+ and CD8+) induced has been 
characterised by two assays (ICS and ELISpot), which would allow determining whether the induced 
response was Th1- or Th2-polarised. Overall, the assays selected for both measures (humoral and 
cellular response) are endorsed. The main assays were qualified or validated. The wtMNA validation is 
ongoing. Additional reports and information should be provided by the applicant as soon as possible 
(see list of recommendations). A new SARS-CoV-2 MNA based assay was developed, using a different 
strain, i.e. the variant 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7 lineage). nAb assessment should also include testing 
against other variants of concern, at least 20H/501Y.V2, 20J/501Y.V3 and 20B/S.484K (P.2 Brazilian 
variant) as well as against contemporary variants of concern. Assessment of nAb to these different 
strains is recommended to be performed on, at least, the samples of the Phase 3 trial, for which 
efficacy data against these variants are also available. The applicant is requested to present their plans 
as soon as possible (see list of recommendations). 
In study VAC31518COV1001, a total of 377 and 403 subjects were randomised and vaccinated in 
Cohort 1a and Cohort 3 respectively. A total of 125 and of 584 were enrolled and vaccinated in study 
VAC31518COV1002 (Cohort 1) and study VAC31518COV2001. The treatment discontinuation rate was 
<4.0% (range: 0.8% to 3.7%) in any of the studies/cohorts. There were no major relevant differences 
in baseline or demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups, including placebo, in any of the 
studies/cohorts. 
In study VAC31518COV3001, 43,783 subjects were vaccinated. For further information, see efficacy 
section. 
The submitted interim report of study VAC31518COV1001 contains immunology data through Day 85 
(post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 data) for all participants in Cohorts 1 (aged ≥18 to ≤55 years) and 
through Day 57 for participants in Cohort 3 (aged ≥65 years, no data post-dose 2). Of note, for Cohort 
3, the actual timing of the Day 57 blood draw ranged from 86 to 107 days post vaccination due to 
study pause (median visit = Day 87). For studies VAC31518COV1002, VAC31518COV2001, and 
VAC31518COV3001, the submitted interim reports contain available immunogenicity data collected 
through 28 days post-dose 1. 
Selection of the dose, meeting pre-specified criteria, was based on immunogenicity (nAb response rate 
and Th1/Th2 ratio) and safety data up to 28 days post-dose 1 immunogenicity from Cohort 1a and 
available data from Cohort 3 of study VAC31518COV1001. Subsequent trials VAC31518COV1002 and 
VAC31518COV2001 have also evaluated two dose levels of 5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp. 
In trial VAC31518COV1001, neutralising antibody response rates were high for both dose levels 
(5×1010 vp and 1×1011 vp) and overall comparable between age categories (younger and the older 
adults >65 years of age) at 28 days post-first vaccination. A trend for higher GMT with the higher 
vaccine dose was observed in the young adults enrolled in the Phase 1 study conducted in Japan. This 
might however be explained by different factors, such as the higher proportion of females and of 
seropositive subjects at baseline in the 1×1011 vp when compared to the 5×1010 vp. In addition, the 
sample size was limited. Of note, similar nAb GMTs were observed between both dose levels in study 
VAC31518COV2001. Although not taken into account for dose selection, it should be noted that a trend 
for higher binding antibody GMT with the higher vaccine dose was observed at Day 29 and Day 85 in 
the younger adults and at Day 87 in the older adults. S specific - CD4 Th1 cells, as defined by the 
Assessment report

applicant, were detectable at Day 15 and proportions of positive samples and median responses 
remained stable up to Day 29. CD8 Th1 cells were also detected as early as Day 15 and their 
proportions and median responses further increased by Day 29. Specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses 
were overall in the same range for both dose levels, for both the proportion of positive samples and 
median responses. A low proportion of specific CD4 Th2 cells was detected in 1 subject only following 
vaccination. Th1/Th2 ratios were therefore ≥ 1 for all subjects. ELISpot results confirmed the results 
observed by the ICS method, an induction of Th1 cells responses in most of the vaccinated subjects, 
and overall comparable between groups. In conclusion, both dose levels, in both age groups, met the 
pre-specified criteria for dose selection, i.e. a lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) ≥65% and a 
Th1>Th2 within responder population. The lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) ≥65% was also 
observed in the 2 other studies for both dose levels. Taking all the above results into account, the 
applicant decided to continue the clinical development with the 5x1010 vp dose level.  
Since the pre-specified criteria were met for both dose levels after one single vaccine dose, the 
applicant selected the single regimen to be tested in the VAC31518COV3001 trial. The persistence of 
humoral immune responses is not known for more than 3 months. 
The second vaccine dose induced an increase in antibody titers, supporting the 2-dose schedule. Due 
to a study pause, immunogenicity evaluation of the added value of a second vaccine dose, with the 
adequate planned interval, will be missing for the older aged group. A 2-dose regimen is being 
evaluated in study VAC31518COV3009 as this may result in higher and more durable protective 
immune response. 
The immune responses induced by the selected dose level and schedule (5x1010 vp single dose) 
showed that: 
Both specific binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies (nAb) were detectable 14 days following 
vaccination (study VAC31518COV1001 and study VAC31518COV2001). Both responder rates and Ab 
GMTs further increased up to 28 days post-vaccination in the older adults, whereas in the younger 
adults, Ab GMTs increase from 28 days up to 56 days post-vaccination. Ab titers then plateau up to 84 
days post-vaccination (study VAC31518COV1001). Responder rates were already high at 28 days post-
vaccination, so no/slight further increase were noted thereafter. No longer term data are available. 
Neutralising Ab titers correlated highly with binding Ab titers, in both the young and older adults, at 
both Day 29 and Day 71 (young adults only). This was performed with qualified, non-validated assays, 
and should be confirmed on samples from the Phase 3 trial, including participants of various countries 
and with comorbidities (see list of recommendations). In trial VAC31518COV3001, binding antibodies 
were detected, and GMTs were overall comparable between sites and countries, i.e. Brazil, South Africa 
and the US. Although results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited sample size per site, 
these results suggest that the population characteristics and environmental factors do not interfere 
with binding Ab responses induced by the vaccine. 
• 
Functional antibodies, other than nAb, with a suggested role in viral clearance in vivo, were 
detected at 14 days post-vaccination and proportion and median of response increase up to 
Day 29 (no data available after Day 29), in both the younger and the older adults. High 
correlations were observed between the phagocytic score and nAb or binding Ab titers. 
•  Specific CD4 and CD8 Th1 cells were also detected at 14 days following vaccination. The 
proportion of CD4 Th1 positive samples remains stable (young adults) or slightly increases 
(older adults) up to 28 days post-vaccination, whereas the proportion of CD8 Th1 positive 
samples further increases up to 28 days post-vaccination. Medians of responses were 
apparently calculated taking into account all the samples, regardless of their positivity. 
Determination of medians of responses based on positive samples only would have given a 
better idea of the magnitude of the response in ‘responder’ subjects. The MAH is requested to 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 85/218 
 
 
 
 
provide median of responses based on positive samples only and comparison between group in 
the final CSR (see list of recommendations). 
•  Median CD4 Th2 responses were overall undetectable at Day 15 and Day 29 in all vaccine 
groups. CD8 Th2 cells were not assessed. 
• 
In addition to the characterisation by ICS, Th1 and Th2 phenotypes were characterised by IFN-
γ and IL-4 ELISpot and results were consistent with those observed by the ICS method. 
•  Neutralising activity of immune sera from participants of study VAC31518COV1001 vaccinated 
with Ad26.COV2.S was tested against the emerging Kent variant, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage. 
The capacity of the vaccine-induced nAb to neutralise the B.1.1.7 strain increased from Day 29 
to Day 71. Further evolution over time is unknown. In addition, although a second vaccine-
dose was demonstrated to boost the nAb response, the neutralising capacity for the Victoria 
1/2020 strain remained higher compared to the B.1.1.7 strain. This difference in neutralisation 
capacity is not unexpected since the mutation N501Y is in the receptor binding domain of the 
Spike protein. A difference in neutralising capacity was also observed for the ChAdOx1 nCoV-
19 vaccine. These data are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution as the assays 
have not been validated for direct comparisons across variants. Furthermore, the correlation 
between VNA titers and vaccine efficacy has not been established. The clinical relevance of the 
finding is unknown. Additional data on cross-neutralisation for clinically relevant and emerging 
SARS-CoV-2 strains by testing sera of human clinical participants, particularly of study 
VAC31518COV3001 in functional in vitro assays, are expected (see list of recommendations). 
Immune responses induced by alternative dose levels were investigated in the Phase 2 
VAC31518COV2001 trial, at dose level of 1.25x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, and 1x1011 vp. At 2 
weeks and one-month post-vaccination, responder rates were high and comparable between the dose 
levels of 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, and 1x1011 vp. The responder rates were lower for the 1.25x1010 vp 
vaccine group when compared to the 3 other groups. nAb GMTs were overall comparable between the 
2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp groups 2 weeks following vaccination, with only a modest 
increase with dose levels. At Day 29, GMTs were increased when compared to 14 days post-
vaccination. Lower nAb GMTs were also observed in the 1.25x1010 vp group at both timepoint when 
compared to the 3 other groups. At 28 days post-vaccination, nAb titers were overall comparable 
between younger and older adults in study VAC31518COV1001. In contrast to results of Cohort 1a 
(young adults), a trend for lower Ab GMT value was observed at 86 days post-vaccination. As 
consequence, GMT value was lower than the ones observed in the younger adults at 56- or 70-days 
post-vaccination. These decrease in neutralising titers maybe due to the immunosenescence 
phenomenon. As no subject > 75 years of age were included in the wtVNA analysis, Ab neutralising 
capacity is unknow for old subjects (> 75 years of age) but could be even more impaired. 
A decrease in functionality of vaccine-induced Ab was also evidenced by the lower phagocytic score 
GMs and positivity rates observed 28 days post-vaccination in the older vs the younger adults. Binding 
Ab GMT values were lower in the older adults than those observed in the younger adults up to 3 
months post-first vaccination, but differently than what it was observed for older adults in nAb titers, 
S-binding GMTs continued to increase until the last day that was registered. The proportion of positive 
samples in the older adults, for both CD4 and CD8 Th1 response, were lower than those observed in 
the younger adults. Median of the CD4 Th1 responses are comparable between both age groups, but 
median CD8 Th1 response was lower for the older when compared to the younger adults. However, 
these results cannot be interpreted since they are based on the total subjects and not on seropositive 
subjects. 
Based on preliminary results, vaccine-induced immune responses appear to be lower in the older vs 
the younger adults. A decrease in functionality is observed, which is not unexpected since it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

recognised that older individuals might have impaired immune responses. The impact on the 
persistence and on the protection is unknown. These observations support studying the role of a 
second dose as it is currently being done with the ongoing trial (VAC31518COV3009). 
Limited results showed that vaccine elicited immune responses in seropositive subjects were similar or 
higher and with the same kinetics when compared to seronegative subjects. A trend for higher nAb and 
binding Ab responses in females compared to males was observed, in both study VAC31518COV1001 
and study VAC31518COV2001. No data available comparing immunogenic induced by vaccination in 
subjects with or without comorbidities. 
Ad26 nAb were measured, at baseline and/or post-first vaccination, in studies VAC31518COV1001, 
VAC31518COV1002 and VAC31518COV3001.  
Detectable baseline levels of Ad26 nAb were observed in only few participants in studies 
VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV1002. In study VAC31518COV3001, vaccinated participants 
from Brazil had an overall Ad26 seroprevalence of 32.5% whereas seroprevalence in the US 
participants was 2.0% in the vaccine group. Although the responder rate (as measured by S-ELISA at 
Day 29) was slightly higher for Brazilian participants with no detectable Ad26 nAb at baseline when 
compared to Brazilian participants with detectable Ad26 nAb at baseline, no strong correlation was 
observed between S binding Ab levels 28 days post-vaccination and pre-existing Ad26 nAb at baseline. 
This is consistent with the overall comparable GMT values observed 28 days post-vaccination between 
the US site and the Brazilian sites. 
Although Ad26-nAb were detected in more than 95% of participants following vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S in study VAC31518COV1001, it did not suggest an apparent negative impact of anti-
Ad26 vector immunity induced by the first vaccine dose on the post-dose 2 insert specific vaccine-
elicited humoral immune responses. Correlation between Ad26 nAb pre-dose 2 and SARS-CoV-2 nAb 
post-dose 2 was poor. The impact on binding Ab and T cell responses was not presented. Overall, the 
potential impact of natural or vaccine induced anti-Ad26 immunity on immunogenicity and vaccine 
efficacy remains unclear and should be further documented. Integrated results of the different trials 
included in the COVID-19 clinical development programme, and overall for Ad26-based vaccination, if 
possible, are further expected (see list of recommendations). 
Results of studies VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002, and VAC31518COV2001 do not suggest an 
impact of the use of antipyretics/analgesics post-vaccination on the vaccine-induced nAb. Humoral 
vaccine-induced immune responses are available up to 85 days post-dose 1 for a limited number of 
young participants of study VAC31518COV1001. Ab responses were sustained up to 3 months post-
vaccination. The persistence of the response for a longer period is unknown. In studies 
VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002 and VAC31518COV2001, participants are to be followed up to 
1 year post last vaccination. Participants of the immunogenicity subset of study VAC31518COV3001 
will be followed-up until 2 years. A longer follow-up for participants of Cohorts 1 and 3 of study 
VAC31518COV1001 would have allowed a direct comparison of the long-term immunogenicity for the 
1- and 2-dose schedules. Participants of Cohorts 2a and 2b of study VAC31518COV1001 will be 
followed for a longer duration (36 and 38 months, respectively). The effect of a booster dose given at 
various timepoints will be evaluated in a 1- or 2-dose regimen in Cohorts 2a and 2b. In the absence of 
ICP, the timing for a booster dose will be difficult to establish. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the 
immune response, at various timepoints, following a boost is important to evaluate. In addition, 
because of the circulation of different strains, it is not known if such booster, i.e. with the prototype 
vaccine, will be needed in the future or if a new vaccine construct with a different or additional 
strain(s) would be needed. The expected data might nevertheless give an idea on the optimal/best 
timing for a boost, in term of immunogenicity, that could guide the choice for a boost timing, 
regardless of the strain(s) included in the vaccine. The assessment of the anamnestic response of 
Assessment report

study VAC31518COV2001 would also give information on the need for a boost. However, the interval 
between vaccination and the assessment of an anamnestic response is 4 or 6 months, which may be 
too short (see list of recommendations) . 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Interim immunogenicity results are available from 4 ongoing trials. Results consistently demonstrated 
that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp elicits both humoral and 
cellular immune responses in adult ≥18 to ≤55 years and ≥65 years of age. However, vaccine-induced 
immune responses appear to be lower in the older vs the younger adults. 
Neutralising and binding Ab were sustained up to 3 months after vaccination, in adults ≥18 to ≤55 
years. Persistence of Ab over a longer period is not known. It is not known if Ab will persist in a similar 
fashion in older adults. 
A 2.5-3 fold increase in antibody titers is observed following a second vaccine dose given at 56 days 
interval. This supports the applicant’s choice to evaluate a 2-dose regimen in an efficacy trial. 
The impact of pre-existing immunity to Ad26 still remains to be further investigated. First results of the 
COVID-19 program do not indicate a major impact of presence of Ad26-nAb on the vaccine-induced 
humoral response. 
Preliminary data showed that neutralising antibodies elicited by Ad26.COV2.S were able to neutralise 
the B.1.1.7 lineage variant in vitro, although less efficiently than the reference strain. These data are 
however to be interpreted with caution as the assays have not been validated for direct comparison 
across variants. 
In the absence of immunological correlates of protection, the clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant is performing two phase III studies. Both are multicentre, randomised, double blind, 
placebo-controlled studies, to determine pivotal efficacy and safety in adults aged 18 years and older. 
The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S will be evaluated in these participants after 
one (VAC31518COV3001- ESEMBLE) or two intramuscular doses (VAC31518COV3009 - HORIZON).  
The study VAC31518COV3001 is being carried out in several centres in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and US, and it will include up to 40,000 healthy adults aged 18 
years and older. This study is the one presented by the applicant for this MAA.  
The study VAC31518COV3009 is being carried out in several centres in US, UK, France, Germany, 
Italy, Spain, and South Africa and it will include up to 30.000 healthy adults aged 18 years. The 
applicant has not presented results from this study for the current MAA.

Notes to the previous table: 
-  Molecularly  confirmed  COVID-19  is  defined  as  a  positive  SARS-CoV-2  viral  RNA  result  by  a  central 
laboratory using a PCR-based or other molecular diagnostic test. 
- All efficacy analyses will occur in the per-protocol (PP) analysis set, in seronegative participants unless 
otherwise indicated in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
Efficacy assessments and procedures: 
An active surveillance of COVID-19 signs and symptoms is in place for all participants. This surveillance 
(symptom check) is done through a digital tool referred to as ‘electronic clinical outcome assessment’ 
(eCOA). Participants are asked at least twice a week, through this eCOA, if they have experienced any 
new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Participant 
failing to complete the surveillance question upon reminders were contacted by the site.  
The criteria for suspected COVID-19 (ie, the triggers to proceed with home-collection of the nasal 
swabs on COVID-19 Day 1-2 and to proceed with the COVID-19 Day 3-5 visit) were prespecified as 
follows: a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2, through a private or public laboratory independent 
of the study, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic OR new onset or worsening of any 1 of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 95/218 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms from a pre-defined list of symptoms (symptoms from the CDC list and additional 
symptoms), which lasts for at least 24 hours, not otherwise explained.  
In the event a participant experiences COVID-19-like signs and symptoms meeting pre-specified 
criteria for suspected COVID-19, or a participant became aware of a positive RT-PCR test result for 
SARS-CoV-2 outside the study site context, this triggered swabbing and other specific procedures. The 
site had to reach out to the participant at the latest on COVID-19 Day 2 to assess whether the 
reported signs and symptoms qualified as a suspected COVID-19 episode using prespecified criteria. As 
several of the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 overlap with vaccine-related reactogenicity, 
investigators' clinical judgement was used to exclude vaccine-related events when assessing suspected 
COVID-19.  
Case Definitions 
Case Definition for Moderate COVID-19  
• A SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample 
(e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample

Page 96/218 
 
 
 
 
* SpO2 criteria were adjusted according to altitude per the investigator judgement. 
** Having 2 or more elements of a symptom (e.g., vomiting and diarrhoea or fatigue and loss of appetite) was counted only as 
1 symptom for the case definition. To meet the case definition, a participant had to have at least 2 different symptoms. 
Case Definition for Severe/Critical COVID-19 
- A SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample 
(e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample. 
AND any 1 of the following at any time during the course of observation: 
- Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute, heart 
rate ≥125 beats/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93% on room air at sea level*, or partial 
pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg). 
* SpO2 criteria will be adjusted according to altitude per the investigator judgement. 
- Respiratory failure (defined as needing high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical 
ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). 
- Evidence of shock (defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure <60 
mmHg, or requiring vasopressors). 
- Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction. 
- Admission to the ICU. 
- Death. 
Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee: 
All cases meeting the severe/critical criteria are adjudicated by the Clinical Severity Adjudication 
Committee (CSAC) to determine if the case is severe/critical in their judgement.  
All potential severe/critical COVID-19 cases defined as those cases that meet the severe/critical 
definition by scoring of signs and/or symptoms or meet the moderate endpoint definition with a total of 
3 or more signs and/or symptoms were assessed independently by the CSAC. 
Classification of severity was based on the highest degree of severity during the observation period. 
Classification of a case as severe/critical by the CSAC is considered definitive. The CSAC independently 
evaluates the severity of the COVID-19 cases in a blinded manner. 
Additional information was provided in the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee Charter. 
Case Definition for Mild COVID-19  
- A SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample 
(e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample; 
AND at any time during the course of observation: 
- One of the following symptoms: fever (≥38.0°C or ≥100.4°F), sore throat, malaise (loss of appetite, 
generally unwell, fatigue, physical weakness), headache, muscle pain (myalgia), gastrointestinal 
symptoms, cough, chest congestion, runny nose, wheezing, skin rash, eye irritation or discharge, 
chills, new or changing olfactory or taste disorders, red or bruised looking feet or toes, or shaking chills 
or rigors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 97/218 
 
 
 
 
 
A case is considered mild when it meets the above case definition but not the moderate to 
severe/critical definition. 
US FDA Harmonized Case Definition for COVID-19 
If a participant presents with symptoms as those listed by the US FDA harmonized case definition 
(Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of Coronavirus. 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html., see picture below), 
the investigator (or designated medically trained clinician) should assess if these are suggestive of 
COVID-19: 
- A SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample 
(e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample; AND 
- COVID-19 symptoms consistent with those defined by the US FDA harmonized case definition at the 
time of finalisation of this protocol: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny 
nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea. 
BOD endpoint 
To evaluate the effect of the vaccine against symptomatic molecularly confirmed COVID-19, including 
mild infections, a BOD endpoint was evaluated based on the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed 
COVID-19, including mild, moderate and severe/critical case definitions, with onset at least 14 days 
after vaccination (Day 15) and with onset at least 28 days after vaccination (Day 29). In this study, 
the BOD endpoint is defined as taking the value 1 for mild and moderate disease and the value 2 for 
severe disease (implicitly assigning a value of 0 for no disease [not infected or asymptomatic 
infection]).  
Case Definition for Asymptomatic or Undetected COVID-19 
If a participant does not fulfil the criteria for suspected COVID-19 based on signs and symptoms. 
AND 
- has a SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract 
sample (e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample 
OR 
- develops a positive serology (non-S protein) test  
Then, the participant is considered to have experienced asymptomatic or undetected COVID-19. 
SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion Assessment: 
An immunologic test for SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (ELISA and/or SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin 
assay) based on SARS-CoV-2 N protein will be performed to identify cases of asymptomatic infection 
on samples obtained at Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after 
vaccination. 
Virology assessments: 
Participants with suspected COVID-19 self-collected a nasal swab at home on the Day of symptom’s 
onset or the following day (Day 1-2). Another nasal swab was taken on Day 3-5 by a health care 
professional during site visit. The nasal swabs could also be collected at hospital or other location, if 
needed. Nasal swabs were then self-collected once every 2 days (by the participant at home). Saliva 
samples were collected by the participant on COVID-19 Day 3-5 and then once every 2 days if 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 98/218 
 
 
 
 
participants met the protocol prespecified criteria for suspected COVID-19 on COVID-19 Day 1-2 and 
COVID-19 Day 3-5 (as assessed during Part 1 of the COVID-19 Day 3-5 visit). Nasal samples were 
collected with a foam tip mid-turbinate swab. The saliva samples were collected with the 
OMNIgeneOral RNA/DNA device. 
Virological confirmation of the endpoint cases and viral shedding assessment: 
Nasal swabs were used to detect and/or quantify SARS-CoV-2. Exploratory quantification of the SARS-
CoV-2 viral load in saliva samples could also be performed. Nasal swabs were tested at the central 
laboratory. All nasal swabs were also tested by a local laboratory for case management, as central 
laboratory results are not be available in real time. In case a SARS-CoV-2 local RT-PCR test is not 
available, the RT-PCR on swab sample will be performed centrally. Sites have to use a molecular (PCR) 
diagnostic test from Tier-1 and Tier-2 list of assays, all with FDA EUA, as predefined by the COVID-19 
vaccine taskforce (formerly operation warp speed). Confirmation testing was done by a central lab at 
Washington University, using the Tier-1 Abbott Realtime SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. The Abbott 
m2000 qualitative PCR received EUA and uses a dual target strategy to detect stretches in the RdRp 
and in the N genes. An unrelated RNA sequence is spiked as internal processing control. All sites in 
South Africa used BARC as local central lab for testing. 
Gene sequencing: 
Sequencing of all cases samples is ongoing, in order to detect which are the infectious strains, 
particularly in South Africa and Brazil because of the circulation of variants of concern during the study 
period. Nasal swab specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases were used for sequence 
analysis. One sample per subject, taken as close as possible to the onset of symptoms, was selected 
when SARS-CoV-2 viral load was >200 copies/mL. Next-generation sequencing was performed using 
the Swift Biosciences SNAP Version 2.0, performed at the Virology Laboratory of the University of 
Washington. The SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu1 variant including the D614G mutation is taken as the 
reference sequence. Only S gene information was considered, and whole viral genome sequences have 
not yet been analysed.  
Efficacy evaluations  
Sample size 
The sample size has been triggered by the total number of cases TNE. The assumptions were VE of 
60%, Null VE value of 30%, randomisation ratio of 1:1, one-sided 2.5% alpha and 90% statistical 
power employing the sequential probability ratio test [SPRT] to perform a fully sequential design 
analysis. That lead to a target number of events (TNE) of 154. 
The applicant performed a relevant change in the third protocol amendment and the total sample size 
was decreased from 60,000 participants to 40,000. The applicant’s rationale was based in that the 
COVID incidence was underestimated at the moment of the trial design, and that the attack rates were 
actually higher. Thus, statistical calculations supported the decision to randomise 40.000 patients to 
obtain a minimum TNE of 154. 
Randomisation 
Central randomisation was implemented in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 
vaccination groups (active vaccine [Group 1] versus placebo [Group 2]). This was based on a 
computer-generated randomisation schedule. The randomisation was balanced by using randomly

permuted blocks and was stratified by vaccination unit, age group, and absence/presence of 
comorbidities that are or might be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-
19. 
The randomisation system was used to control the age distribution of participants in the trial; in particular 
the age ranges of ≥18 to <40 and ≥40 to <60 years can be closed separately for further randomisation 
in order to obtain a distribution of approximately 20% and 50% for these age ranges, respectively, and 
to have a minimum of approximately 30% of the population to be ≥60 years. 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding will be guaranteed by the preparation of the study vaccine by an unblinded pharmacist or other 
qualified study-site personnel with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing, 
and by the administration of vaccine in a masked syringe by a blinded study vaccine administrator.  
Data that may potentially unblind the study vaccine assignment (i.e. immunogenicity data, study vaccine 
accountability data, study vaccine allocation, biomarker, or other specific laboratory data) will be handled 
with  special  care  to  ensure  that  the  integrity  of  the  blind  is  maintained  and  the  potential  for  bias  is 
minimised. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from 
view  by  the  investigators,  clinical  team,  or  others  as  appropriate  until  the  time  of  database  lock  and 
unblinding. 
Investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an 
authorised/licensed COVID-19 vaccine if/when these become available. In these cases, the investigator 
will discuss with the participant available options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an 
authorised/licensed vaccine according to local immunisation guidelines or recommendation and if the 
participant wishes to proceed with the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures 
as described in the protocol. 
Statistical methods 
Overall statistical design 
This is a fully sequential trial in which the statistical boundaries were based on a truncated sequential 
probability ratio test (SPRT). Two co-primary endpoints were predefined based on the case definition 
with onset of at least 14- and 28-days post-vaccination, in the per protocol population set at an overall 
2.5% one-sided alpha level. 
The trial positiveness was predefined for a simultaneously superiority for the two-coprimary endpoints 
against the null value of 30% VE, with both point estimates >50% VE, and ≥5 cases in the placebo 
arm. 
Vaccine Efficacy = 100 x (1-ratio of incidence vaccine/placebo)% 
The statistical monitoring for efficacy started once: 
• 
the following criteria were met for cases of onset at least 28 days after vaccination: (a) ≥6 
cases for the ≥60years age, (b) ≥42 cases moderate to severe/critical, (c) ≥5 cases 
severe/critical, and assessed weekly 
AND  
• 
pre-specified non-efficacy boundaries were met OR 154 cases with onset 28 days after 
vaccination 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021  
Page 100/218 
 
 
 
 
Also, the analysis might be triggered in case non-efficacy boundary was met OR the harm boundary 
was crossed. 
Multiplicity for secondary endpoints 
The evaluation of secondary endpoints was adjusted for multiple testing of multiple endpoints (using a 
graphical approach, Bretz et al 2009) and potential stopping at an interim analysis evaluation through 
a Pocock boundary using Wang-Tsiatis with Delta=0.5. Since no interim analysis was performed, the 
statistical hypothesis testing scheme started at the primary analysis. The associated alpha levels and 
confirmatory endpoints are listed in the following Table. For all displays in the body of this report, an 
adjusted 95% CI is shown when a statistical hypothesis was evaluated to control the false positive 
rate. Otherwise data are summarised descriptively, using a 95% CI.  
Populations for Analysis Sets  
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 
- Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomised participants with a documented study vaccine 
administration, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations and serostatus at enrolment. 
Analyses of safety will be performed on the FAS. Vaccine efficacy analyses can be repeated using the 
FAS. 
- Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population: Participants in the FAS who receive study vaccine and 
who are seronegative at the time of vaccination and who have no other major protocol deviations that 
were judged to possibly impact the efficacy of the vaccine. The PA of VE will be based on the PP 
population. The PP will be the main analysis population for efficacy analyses. 
The following variables are relevant for in/exclusion of analyses: 
- If a participant is seropositive at baseline, the participant is excluded from the PP set. In case 
the test result is missing or unknown the participant is considered as seronegative for analysis 
purposes. 
 - PCR positive (PCR+) or negative (PCR-) at baseline: a sample for SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
baseline is collected for each participant. For participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection during 
the study this sample is tested. If a participant was analysed PCR+ at baseline, the participant is 
excluded from the PP set.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 44,325 participants were randomised to the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine arm (n=22,174) or to the 
placebo arm (n=22,151) to the placebo arm. The proportion of subjects randomised and not 
vaccinated was very low and balanced between arms (1.3% vs 1.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo 
arms respectively). A total of 43,783 randomised participants received the study vaccine (21,895 and 
21,888 in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms). This cohort constitutes the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Of 
the participants in the FAS, 19,630 (89.7%) and 19,691 (90.0%) were included in the Per Protocol 
Efficacy Set (PP), respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms (total of 39,321). 
A total of 4462 participants were eliminated from the PP. Baseline seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 
the main reason for elimination from the PP set (n=4217) and/or being PCR positive at the time of 
vaccination the second reason (n=238). Other reasons were major protocol deviations (evaluated to 
possibly impact efficacy, on inclusion/exclusion criteria, or received wrong treatment, or received a 
disallowed concomitant medication). Reasons for elimination from the PP were balanced across groups. 
In the FAS, 54.6% of participants had a follow-up of at least 2 months after vaccination (calculated as 
8 weeks) in both arms (in the PP, respectively 54.6% and 54.7% Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms), at 
the time of this primary analysis. The median follow-up time after vaccination was 58.0 days in both 
arms, in both the FAS and the PP.  
In the FAS, 1080 (4.9%) and 1177 (5.4%) participants were unblinded respectively in the vaccine and 
placebo arms, up to the cut-off date of 22 January 2021. The percentage of unblinding is balanced 
across arms. Unblinding were all due to request to be unblinded by participants who became eligible to 
receive an authorised/licensed COVID-19 vaccine (no unblinding for safety concern). Following 
emergency use authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines in December, participants were offered the 
possibility to have access to the vaccines if they were part of the risk groups for which the vaccine was 
recommended (it was essentially in the US). Participants that were unblinded for this purpose 
remained under follow up in the study. Data collected up to unblinding are included in the analysis 
described in this report.  
Very few subjects terminated study participation prematurely at the time of data cut-off point for the 
primary analysis (in the FAS: 49 [0.2%] vs 96 [0.4%] and in the PP: 41 [0.2%] vs 89 [0.5%] in the 
Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms respectively). The main reason for termination was withdrawal by 
subject (in the FAS: 35 [0.2%] vs 66 [0.3%] and in the PP 30 [0.2%] vs 62 [0.3%] in the 
Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms respectively). The proportion of premature termination was slightly 
higher in the placebo vs vaccination arm.

Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the protocol. The first amendment (15 September 2020) was adopted 
before any study-related procedures had begun and mainly implemented the selected dose level of 
5×1010 vp for Ad26.COV2.S based on data from the FIH study VAC31518COV1001. The second 
amendment (29 October 2020) included the following changes: clarification that all participants that 
have an RT-PCR positive finding for SARS-CoV-2, even if asymptomatic, will be followed until there are 
2 consecutive negative PCRs, correction of errors and minor editorial changes. The third amendment 
(14 December 2020) included the main following changes: The occurrence of molecularly confirmed, 
moderate to severe/critical COVID-19, with onset at least 28 days postvaccination was added as a co-
primary endpoint in addition to the current primary endpoint counting as of 14 days post-vaccination. 
The applicable secondary and exploratory endpoints were updated similarly to also include COVID-19 
cases with onset at least 28 days post-vaccination. In addition, the total sample size was reduced from 
60,000 to approximately 40,000 participants. The protocol is further amended to change the conditions 
for monitoring whether efficacy greater than 30% is achieved using the sequential monitoring 
algorithm. Furthermore, additional secondary and exploratory objectives and endpoints were added. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
FAS: 
The main region was Northern America (United States: 44.1% of subjects in both groups), followed by 
Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico: 40.9% of subjects in both groups). 
There was a substantial representation of Southern Africa (15.0% in both groups). Latin American 
subjects mainly originated from Brazil (16.6%) Colombia (9.7%) and Argentina (6.8%).  
Approximately a fifth of the participants were frontline essential workers (6.9% vs. 7.0%) or health 
care professionals (13.0% vs. 12.8%). There were only few long-term care residents: 0.3% (n=63) vs. 
0.4% (n=85) in respective groups. 
A total of 9.6% of the participants were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline (9.8% vs 9.4% in 
respective arms). These participants were excluded from the PP set. Data on serostatus was missing in 
637 vaccinees vs 625 placebo subjects. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was highest in South Africa region 
(23.8% vs. 22.9%), followed by Latin America (10.6% vs. 10.0%), and Northern America (4.4% vs. 
4.3%). Seroprevalence varied across countries from Latin America (for the most represented 
countries: Argentina: 6.1% vs. 5.6%, Brazil: 6.0% vs. 6.0%, Colombia: 12.4% vs. 11.4%). 
In the FAS, mean age was 50.7 years (median 52.0 years) in both groups, with a range of 18;100 
years and 18;94 years respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. Of the FAS 
participants, 33.5% were ≥60 years in both groups (23.9% vs. 24.5% were 60-69 years, 8.6% vs. 
8.1% were 70-79 years, 1.0% vs. 1.0% were ≥80 years in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo 
group). The proportion of participants ≥65 years was 19.5% (n=4259) and 19.7% (n=4302), and the 
proportion of participants ≥75 years was 3.7% (n=809) and 3.3% (n=732), respectively in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. 
The proportion of females was 44.9% vs 45.2% in the vaccine vs the placebo arm.  
Overweight (BMI 25 - <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) individuals were well represented in 
the trial, with 37.6% vs 38.6% of the participants being overweight, and 28.6% vs. 28.4% being 
obese in respective arms. At least one comorbidity was present at baseline for 40.8% of the 
participants in both groups (29.0% vs. 28.6% had one comorbidity, 8.7% vs. 8.9% had two

comorbidities, and 3.1% vs. 3.3% had 3 or more comorbidities). Obesity (28.7% vs. 28.4%) was the 
most represented comorbidity, followed by hypertension (10.2% vs. 10.5%) and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (7.3% vs. 7.3%). Other comorbidities present in more than 1% of the subjects were: asthma, 
COPD, and serious heart conditions. Of the FAS, 2.7% vs 2.8% of the participants were HIV infected, 
in the vaccine vs the placebo arm. The HIV infection status is unknown for 59.2% in both arms. In the 
FAS, 0.2% of the subjects in both groups present an immunodeficiency condition (43 vs. 36 
participants in respective groups), <0.1% present secondary immunodeficiency (7 vs. 3), 0.5% 
present malignant neoplasm (112 vs. 114), and 0.5% present chronic kidney disease (112 vs. 118) 
(Source: TSIMH01). 
PP: 
Participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline were excluded from the PP set. 
The main region was Northern America (United States: 46.8% and 46.6% in respective groups), 
followed by Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico: 40.6% and 40.7% of 
subjects in respective groups). There was a substantial representation of Southern Africa (12.6% and 
12.7% in respective groups). Latin American subjects mainly originated from Brazil (17.3%) Colombia 
2125 (9.5%) and Argentina (7.2%).  
Data on the profession of participants and the number of long-term care residents was not provided for 
the PP. 
In the PP, mean age was 51.1 and 51.2 years in respective groups (median 52.0 years and 53.0 years 
respectively), with a range of 18;100 years and 18;94 years respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs 
the placebo group. Of the PP participants, 34.6% were ≥60 years in both groups (24.6% vs. 25.1% 
were 60-69 years, 9.0% vs. 8.4% were 70-79 years, and 1.0% vs 1.0% were ≥80 years, in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group). 
The proportion of participants ≥65 years was 20.3% (n=3984) and 20.4% (n=4018), and the 
proportion of participants ≥75 years was 3.8% (n=755) and 3.5% (n=693), respectively in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. 
The proportion of females was 44.3% vs 44.6% in the vaccine vs the placebo arm.  
Overweight (BMI 25 - <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) individuals were well represented in 
the trial, with 38.1% vs 39.1% of the participants being overweight, and 27.6% vs. 27.5% being 
obese in respective arms. At least one comorbidity was present at baseline for 39.9% vs. 40.0% of the 
participants in respective groups (28.2% vs. 28.0% had one comorbidity, 8.5% vs. 8.8% had two 
comorbidities, and 3.1% vs. 3.2% had 3 or more comorbidities). Obesity (27.6% vs. 27.5%) was the 
most represented comorbidity, followed by hypertension (10.2% vs. 10.3%) and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (7.2% vs. 7.2%). Other comorbidities present in more than 1% of the subjects were: asthma 
(1.3%), COPD (1.0%), and serious heart conditions (2.4%). Of the FAS, 2.4% vs 2.5% of the 
participants were HIV infected, in the vaccine vs the placebo arm. 
PP within regions: 
Age distribution was roughly similar between South African and Latin America regions, but 
mean/median age and the proportion of elderly subjects were higher in the US. The proportion of 
subjects ≥65 years is not presented for the PP. The most frequent comorbidities were the same across 
regions, although frequencies were slightly different. HIV infection was more frequent in South Africa. 
Concomitant therapies 
Antipyretics were recommended post-vaccination for symptom relief as needed. Prophylactic 
antipyretic use was not encouraged. Analgesics/antipyretics were used by 1,128 (5.2%) participants in 
Assessment report

Page 104/218 
 
 
 
 
the Ad26.COV2.S group and 365 (1.7%) participants in the placebo group up to 7 days post-
vaccination. The most frequently used analgesics/antipyretics were paracetamol, metamizole sodium, 
and ibuprofen with a frequency that was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to 
participants in the placebo group. Concomitant medications of special interest (i.e. 
analgesics/antipyretics and corticosteroids) were used by less than 6% of participants in both groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary and key Secondary Vaccine Efficacy Results. 
The summaries of VE against molecularly confirmed COVID-19 with onset 14 days and 28 days, and 1 
day after vaccination are presented in the below tables. 
Cases with an onset at least Day 14: 
For the primary endpoint ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ with an onset beyond Day 14, there 
were 116 vs 348 cases in the vaccine vs the placebo group, corresponding to a 66.9% efficacy 
(Adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40). The lower limit (LL) of the CI of 59% was well above the pre-
specified limit of 30%. Therefore the primary objective was met for this endpoint. It is noted that of 
the 116 vs. 348 cases with an onset beyond Day 14, 66 vs. 193 cases occurred beyond Day 28 (hence 
nearly half occurred in the period 15-28 days, i.e. 50 vs. 155). 
‘Symptomatic COVID-19’ cases (of any severity) were classified as either mild, or moderate or 
severe/critical (per protocol definitions). There were respectively 117 and 351 cases of symptomatic 
COVID-19 cases, of which 1 and 3 were mild and 116 vs. 348 met the primary endpoint case definition 
(i.e. were classified as moderate or severe/critical). As the vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 
cases were captured by the primary endpoint definition, the level of efficacy against ‘symptomatic 
COVID-19’ of any severity was the same (66.9% [95% CI: 59.07; 73.37]) as efficacy against the 
primary endpoint. 
The level efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity was consistent by using the US FDA Harmonized 
COVID-19 cases definition (67.2% [95% CI: 59.32; 73.67], based on 114 vs. 345 cases). Again, this 
shows that vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 illness cases were captured by the primary 
endpoint definition.  
Cases with an onset at least Day 28: 
For the primary endpoint ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ with an onset beyond Day 28, there 
were 66 vs 193 cases in the vaccine vs the placebo group, corresponding to a 66.1% efficacy 
(Adjusted 95% CI: 55.01; 74.80). The lower limit (LL) of the CI of 55% was well above the pre-
specified limit of 30%. Therefore, the primary objective was met for this endpoint. 
There were respectively 66 and 195 cases of ‘symptomatic COVID-19’, of which 0 and 2 were mild and 
66 vs. 193 met the primary endpoint case definition (i.e. were classified as moderate or 
severe/critical). As the vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 cases were captured by the primary 
endpoint definition, the level of efficacy against ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ of any severity was the nearly 
the same (66.5% [95% CI: 55.50; 75.05]) as efficacy against the primary endpoint. The level efficacy 
against COVID-19 of any severity was consistent by using the US FDA Harmonized COVID-19 cases 
definition (66.7% [95% CI: 55.63; 75.23]). The number of cases was 65 vs. 193. 
In the 4,156 participants with baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity including non-centrally confirmed 
cases, 7 COVID-19 cases were reported PCR positive from any source, of which one was confirmed by 
the central laboratory.

Vaccine Efficacy in Participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline: 
Of 4,156 participants with baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, 7 COVID-19 cases with onset at least 
14 days after vaccination were reported PCR positive from any source, of which one was confirmed by 
the central laboratory. 
Onset of Protection Against Molecularly Confirmed Moderate to Severe/Critical COVID-19: 
The cumulative incidence of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases, with 
onset at least 1 day after vaccination is presented in  
Figure 13. The cumulative incidences with onset at least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination were 
also provided. Vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 
cases over time is presented in Figure 14.  
The cumulative incidence of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases shows 
that the curves for the placebo and vaccinated groups start to separate at Day 14, suggesting that the 
onset of protection is at that time.  
The applicant also presented a plot modelling the difference between the curves. This plot suggests 
that protection is starting to establish around Day 14 up to Day 28-35, presumably related to 
maturation of functional immune responses and then stabilises up to Day 56. The figure includes CI, 
which show that the uncertainty around the point estimate are too high (due to small numbers) for 
adequate interpretation after 56 days.

Secondary endpoints 
-Vaccine Efficacy Against Molecularly Confirmed Severe/Critical COVID-19  
More than 23 molecularly confirmed severe/critical (adjudicated) endpoints cases were observed; 
therefore, the statistical hypothesis testing for VE against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID-
19 was performed. Results are presented in in the below tables. Cases that could not be adjudicated 
(such as severe cases that occurred after the cutoff date for adjudication, i.e. 19 January 2021) are 
included in the primary analysis but not included as severe/critical cases. 
Severe cases with an onset at least Day 14: 
Of the 116 vs. 348 moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 
14 days after vaccination, 14 (12%) vs. 60 (17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to 
as severe). Severe disease was a prespecified inferential endpoint. The point estimate of VE against 
severe disease was 76.7% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09). The lower limit of the 95% CI of 55% 
was well above 30% (the prespecified LL was only 0%).  
Severe cases with an onset at least Day 28: 
Of the 66 vs. 193 moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 
28 days after vaccination, 5 (8%) vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as 
severe disease). VE against severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.15; 96.90). 
The lower limit of the CI 95% of 54% was well above 30% (the prespecified LL was only 0%). 
Algorithmic Interpretation of the Severe/Critical Case Definition: 
Cases were classified as ‘severe/critical’ based on clinical assessment by the clinical severity 
adjudication committee. This classification was used in the analyses. Cases were also classified as 
‘severe/critical’ based on a programmed, algorithmic interpretation of the protocol definition (using 
vital signs, MA-COV, and SAE forms without clinical assessment).  
Less cases were classified as severe by the adjudication committee compared to the algorithmic 
definition (in the FAS, 42 vs. 65 for cases ≤Day 14, 35 vs. 61 for cases Day 15 to Day 28, 39 vs. 55 
for >Day 28).

Severity for ‘cases adjudicated’ is based on clinical assessment by the clinical severity adjudication committee outlined per the 
protocol and SAP. Severity for ‘cases programming based’ is based on the programmed, algorithmic interpretation of the protocol 
definition following the algorithm outlined in the SAP. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed, using the ‘algorithmic interpretation’ (for severe case with onset 
at least 14 days and at least 28 days), and generated overall consistent results compared to the 
‘adjudication definition’. With the algorithmic definition, efficacy point estimates were also slightly 
higher for severe compared to moderate disease, but the discrepancy between estimates is lower. 
Onset of protection against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID-19: 
The cumulative incidence curves for severe COVID-19 start to separate at Day 7, suggesting that 
protection may be established earlier for the severe cases. The plot modelling is still to be interpreted 
with caution and it is thus difficult to conclude if protection is evolving differently over time for severe 
compared to moderate cases.

Figure 14: Cumulative Incidence of Molecularly Confirmed Severe/Critical COVID-19 with 
Onset at Least 1 Day After Vaccination; Full Analysis Set (Study VAC31518COV3001) 
- Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic or undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection: 
The applicant provided an additional interim analysis of the asymptomatic cases based on Day 71 
serology results (CSR Addendum) with updated data for participants who had completed their Day 71 
visit up to and including 22 January 2021 (serology results cutoff 8 February 2021). Since the 
supplemental analyses are based on a larger number of N serology results, they supersede the results 
presented in the interim CSR (see above). 
At the time of the primary analysis, 965 participants had their Day 71 samples available, which is only 
about 2% of the FAS seronegative (n=39,548). This update is based on 2,892 participants with Day 71 
serology results, which is 6% of the FAS seronegative and 19% of the number of samples required for 
the confirmatory analysis of the ‘asymptomatic or undetected’ endpoint (which will only be performed 
when 15,000 participants have reached the Day 71 visit). 
Per protocol, an ‘asymptomatic or undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection’ case is ascertained based on 
seroconversion for N-antibodies or based on positive PCR results, in a participant who did not fulfill the 
criteria for suspected COVID-19 based on signs and symptoms.  
The algorithm in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) identified asymptomatic participants as those who 
had no symptoms on the day preceding, the day of, or any time after a positive RT-PCR test. A 
sensitivity analysis was done removing from the case definition the participants who presented 
symptoms at any time since screening. 
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection cases with an onset Day 1 - Day 29: 
Respectively 159 and 182 cases were classified as asymptomatic/undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections 
over the period Day 1 – Day 29, in the vaccine vs. placebo group (FAS seronegative population). This 
leads to an efficacy point estimate of 12.5% (inconclusive). Respectively 153 and 175 cases who 
Assessment report

Page 112/218 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seroconverted for SARS-COV-2 were detected on that period (serology risk set of participants with a 
non-S protein result available on Day 29), for an efficacy of 13.1% (inconclusive).  
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection cases with an onset beyond Day 28: 
There are 22 vs. 54 undetected/asymptomatic cases in the vaccine vs. the placebo group (per protocol 
risk set), resulting in an efficacy of 59.7% (95% CI: 32.75; 76.64), for the period >29 Days. From the 
22 vs. 54 ‘asymptomatic or undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections’ (respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs. 
placebo groups) that occurred beyond Day 29 after vaccination, most (18 vs. 50) were seroconverters 
(with either no PCR test available, or with a negative PCR [only 4 subjects]). The remaining subjects (4 
vs. 4) had a positive PCR result. It is not stated whether these 8 subjects seroconverted as well, and it 
is not stated whether the result was confirmed at central lab. So, respectively 18 vs. 50 participants 
seroconverted to COVID-19 (serology risk set of participants with a non-S protein result available on 
Day 71), for an efficacy of 65.5% (39.91; 81.08).  
Sensitivity analysis: 
Participants who had no symptoms were identified in the database using an algorithm. However, based 
on a manual review, it was found that some PCR positive cases classified as asymptomatic/undetected 
by the algorithm had symptoms 2 days or more prior to the PCR test. The applicant therefore 
performed a sensitivity analysis restricted to the participants without any COVID-19 symptoms since 
screening. Results from this analysis are in general line with the former.

Ancillary analyses 
Supplementary Analyses Including Centrally and Non-centrally Confirmed Cases 
Due to the delay needed to obtain the results from the central lab (average of 14 days), many cases 
with at least 1 positive PCR result from a local source were not confirmed yet at the time of the 
primary analysis. There was a longer confirmation time in some countries in the Latin America region 
and South Africa. Overall, 1,197 cases with at least 1 positive PCR result from any source were 
reported. Of these, 714 (59.6%) had a positive result from the central lab (positive at UoW), 77 
(6.4%) had a positive local result but was not confirmed by the central lab (negative at UoW), for the 
other cases there is no result yet available at the central lab. The percentage of cases with PCR 
positive samples but non-confirmed at central lab was quite similar across countries (<10% in all 
countries), and for the subset of moderate and severe cases. There were no relevant differences across 
groups (overall and by severity level). When reported to the 791 cases who had at least 1 positive PCR 
result from any source and a result available from the central lab, 10% of the cases are not confirmed 
at the central lab.

The summaries of VE against COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination 
including non-centrally confirmed cases are presented in the tables above. Overall, results are in line 
with confirmed cases. 
- Vaccine Efficacy Against Molecularly Confirmed COVID-19 Requiring Medical Intervention: 
Molecularly Confirmed COVID-19 cases Requiring Medical Intervention Collected by the MRU Form: 
The MRU form is expected to be completed by the investigator on Day 3-5 and/or Day 29 of the 
COVID-19 episode. At the time of the primary analysis (cut-off 22 January 2021), not all MRU forms 
were available, and therefore cases occurring with an onset of approximately 29 days (or less) prior to 
the cut-off for database lock may not have been included in this analysis per the SAP. Efficacy against 
molecularly confirmed COVID-19 events requiring medical intervention at least 14 days after 
vaccination, was estimated at 75.0% (95% CI: -25.28; 97.41). As there were less than 23 COVID-19 
cases requiring medical intervention, no inferential testing was performed. This was based on 
respectively 2 (both severe) vs. 8 (6 severe and 2 moderate) cases in the active vs. the placebo group. 
At least 28 days after vaccination, 0 case of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 requiring medical 
intervention were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 5 cases (3 severe and 2 moderate) were 
observed in the placebo group respectively (as less than 6 cases are observed, the VE and IC were 
however not shown). Beyond 14 days and 28 days after vaccination, there were thus 2 vs. 8 and 0 vs. 
5 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 requiring medical intervention, respectively in the 
Ad26.COV2.S vs. placebo group. The 2 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group were hospitalised with 
no ICU admission. The 8 participants in the placebo group were hospitalised, including 1 admitted at 
the ICU.

Additional post-hoc analysis of all COVID-19 related hospitalisations: 
The applicant later presented an additional post-hoc analysis of all COVID-19 related hospitalisations 
(database cutoff of the primary analysis, 22 January 2021), using a specific algorithm (i.e. 
implementing a broader search not using only MRU data, but based on all available information from 
any source, such as SAE forms). In total, 6 vs. 42 COVID-19 related hospitalisations with an onset at 
least 1 day were observed (2 vs. 29 as of 14 days after vaccination, 0 vs. 16 as of 28 days after 
vaccination, in the Ad26.COV2.S group). In the per-protocol analysis set, as of 14 days after 
vaccination, based on 2 versus 29 events, efficacy against COVID-19 related hospitalisations was 
93.1% (95% CI: 72.74; 99.20). When restricting the analysis to cases confirmed by the central lab, 
efficacy was 81.8% (95% CI: 16.69; 98.04), based on 2 vs. 11 events.

Co-primary Vaccine Efficacy by Subgroups: 
This  section  describes  the  results  of  subgroup  analyses  for  VE  for  the  co-primary  endpoints.  For 
subgroups with fewer than 6 cases, no VE was calculated. Vaccine efficacy results across demographic 
and baseline characteristics are summarised in the below tables: 
Vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 by age: 
- With onset at least 14 Days after vaccination  
The efficacy against molecularly confirmed ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ at least 14 days 
after vaccination was established, with slightly higher point estimates in the ≥60 years participants 
(76.3% [95% CI: 61.58; 86.04]) compared to the 18-59 years participants (63.7% [95% CI: 53.87; 
71.58]). Efficacy against cases occurring at least day 14 did not decrease with age. In contrast, there 
was a slight trend for efficacy to increase with age. The point estimates were 62.1%, 65.2%, 70.4%, 
92.0%, in participants 18-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-69 years, and 70-79 years (there were no 
endpoint cases ≥80 years). It is noted that 60 years may not be a clinically relevant cutoff, and EMA 
defines the geriatric population as people aged 65 years and older (CPMP/ICH/379/95). In addition, 
middle and oldest old adults are not well represented in this trial’s population (of the ≥60 years 
participants, 69% are ≥65 years participants but only 11% are ≥75 years). 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/292439/2017). Efficacy was 82.4% (95% CI: 63.90; 92.38) in participants ≥65 
years. 
- With onset at least 28 Days after vaccination: 
The efficacy in terms of primary endpoint at least 28 days after vaccination was similar in the 18-59 
years participants (66.1% [95% CI: 53.30; 75.77]) and the ≥60 years participants (66.2% [95% CI: 
36.74; 82.99]). The point estimates were 66.2%, 66.3%, 62.1%, 79.6%, in participants 18-39 years, 
40-59 years, 60-69 years, and 70-79 years (there were no endpoint cases ≥80 years). Efficacy was 
74.0% (95% CI: 34.40; 91.35) in participants ≥65 years.

In the extended dataset, the efficacy against ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ at least 14 days 
after vaccination were in line in the 18-59 years participants (65.0% [95% CI: 57.42; 71.44]) and the 
≥60 years participants (70.3% [95% CI: 56.53; 80.11]). The point estimates were 63.8%, 66.2%, 
64.7%, 85.1%, in participants 18-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-69 years, and 70-79 years (there were no 
endpoint cases ≥80 years). Efficacy was 76.5% (59.12; 87.30) in participants ≥65 years. 
- With onset at least 28 Days after vaccination: 
The efficacy in terms of primary endpoint at least 28 days after vaccination was similar in the 18-59 
years participants 66.8% (95% CI: 57.50; 74.25) and the ≥60 years participants 60.4% (95% CI: 
36.78; 75.91). The point estimates were 66.2%, 67.6%, 54.6%, 77.0%, in participants 18-39 years, 
40-59 years, 60-69 years, and 70-79 years (there were no endpoint cases ≥80 years). Efficacy was 
68.6% (95% CI: 38.60; 85.06) in participants ≥65 years. 
Vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 by comorbidities: 
Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 was also demonstrated in 
participants with and without comorbidities (point estimates 62.9% and 69.1% for cases with onset at 
least 14 Days after vaccination, and 48.6% and 72.6% for cases with onset at least 28 days after 
vaccination, for participants with and without comorbidities respectively). Efficacy was estimated for 
the most common comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, serious heart 
conditions), and consistent point estimates were shown. Consistent VE were observed when assessed 
including non-centrally confirmed cases.  
Efficacy cannot be assessed in participants with ≥3 comorbidities due to the limited number of cases, 
and nothing can be concluded on a potential trend according to the number of comorbidities. 
The VE point estimates for those with comorbidities were slightly lower for the participants ‘with’ vs. 
‘without’ comorbidities. When stratifying by age (18-59 years vs. 60+ and 18-64 years vs. 65 +), 
there was systematically a lower estimate of VE for those with vs. without comorbidities. 
Within the <60 years strata and the <65 years, efficacy was demonstrated for the participants with 
comorbidities, although the point estimate was slightly lower for the participants with comorbidities.  
However, within the ≥60 years strata and the ≥65 years strata, a larger difference in point estimates 
was observed between participants with and without comorbidities. Efficacy was in addition not 
significant (lower limit of the 95% CI<0) for the older participants with comorbidities when considering 
the events with onset >28 days (while it was for the events with onset at least 14 days). For efficacy 
against cases with onset at least 28 days efficacy was 33.2% (95% CI: -77.59; 76.33) for participants 
≥60 years and 44.0% (-85.99; 85.26) for participants ≥65 years. 
The 95% CI are however very wide, and estimates are based on few events especially >28 days.  
The same pattern was found in the extended data set, although differences were less marked in the 
extended data set

FU duration by age and comorbidities: 
Length of follow up was the shortest for participants in the older age group (≥60 years of age), 
especially for participants with comorbidities. Approximately 50% of the participants 18-59 years 
without comorbidities were followed for at least 65 days, while for the participants 18-59 years with 
comorbidities it was 56 days. The length of follow up for participants ≥60 years of age with 
comorbidities was also shorter than for participants without comorbidities. 
-Approximately 50% of the participants ≥60 years without comorbidities were followed for at least 56 
days, and 25% were followed for at least 72 days after vaccination. 
-Approximately 50% of the participants ≥60 years with comorbidities were followed for at least 50 
days, and 25% were followed for at least 56 days after vaccination, and none were followed at least 72 
days after vaccination.

Overall, presence of comorbidity and older age were independently associated with shorter follow up 
duration. This reflects the staggered study design (participants with comorbidities were enrolled later 
in the trial).  
Vaccine efficacy by countries: 
A summary of vaccine efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 cases with onset at least 14 days and 28 
days after vaccination by country and severity, is presented below. Efficacy against molecularly 
confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 was demonstrated in each participating country. 
Except South Africa, all point estimates were >65% for cases with onset at least 14 days after 
vaccination (not computed in Chile and Mexico due to small numbers). In South Africa, efficacy was of 
lower magnitude compared to other region/countries (39.6% [95% CI: 8.77; 60.46] vs. 69.6% [95% 
CI: 57.37; 78.76] in Latin American countries and 76.6% [95% CI: 65.45; 84.63] in the US, for cases 
with onset at least 14 days). When evaluated at least 28 days after vaccination, discrepancies between 
South Africa and the other regions was less marked (57.3% [95% CI: 26.51; 76.03] vs. 66.0% [95% 
CI: 46.75;78.88] in the Latin America region, and 72.2% [95% CI: 53.12; 84.22] in the US). 
Moreover, heterogeneity across regions is much less marked when considering the extended data set 
(for cases with onset at least 14 days: 52.0% [95% CI: 30.26; 67.44] in South Africa compared to 
64.7% [95% CI: 54.14; 73.02] in the Latin America region and 74.4% [95% CI: 65.00; 81.57] in the 
US). For cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination, differences across countries are small 
(64.0% [95% CI: 41.19; 78.66] in South Africa, 61.0% [95% CI: 46.87; 71.75) in the Latin America 
region and 72.0% [95% CI: 58.19; 81.71] in the US). 
Kaplan Meier curves show that onset of protection occurs later in South Africa (around 28 days while 
overall the onset of protection occurs a 14 days), which may contribute to the lower observed efficacy. 
It might be hypothesised that Ab and/or T cell responses of higher magnitude are needed for 
protection against the SA variant. 
When taking account both confirmed and non-confirmed cases, the vaccine efficacy against severe 
disease was high on all three regions (US, Brazil and South Africa).

Viral genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants  
In the time period during which study VAC31518COV3001was conducted, new SARS-CoV-2 lineages 
emerged in geographical regions where participants for the study were being enrolled. In order to 
conclude on a potential impact of the infecting SARS-CoV-2 strain on VE, whole genome sequencing of 
SRAS-CoV-2 in molecularly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the study was performed. Sample 
prioritisation were country (focusing on South Africa and Brazil), timing of the symptom onset 
(focusing on cases with an onset of symptoms after Day 14 or Day 28 post-vaccination), and severity 
of illness (focusing on cases with at least moderate or severe illness). Future selections will be made to 
ensure that as many cases as possible are sequenced 
New SARS-CoV-2 virus lineages are rapidly developing which include mutations in the virus S protein 
in areas such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD), that are known 
targets of neutralising antibodies. Concerns have grown whether vaccines currently in use or in late 
development that are designed based on the Wuhan-Hu1 variant (as the Ad26.COV2.S) will be able to 
protect against some of these new virus lineages. Of main concern are the spreading lineages 
originating from South Africa (lineage B.1.351, variant 20H/501Y.V2, see figure below), the UK 
(lineage B1.1.7, variant 20I/501Y.V1) and Brazil (lineage P.1, variant 20J/501Y.V3) due to mutations 
in the RBD and NTD that have shown to impact neutralisation. 
At the time of writing this updated report, S gene sequences were completed for 512 of 714 (71.7%) 
molecularly confirmed cases. Cases were selected for sequencing based on a viral load of >200 
copies/mL, sufficient sample volume, sequencing prioritisation of samples from specific countries and 
severity of illness. The majority of molecularly confirmed infections in both the vaccine and placebo 
group are moderate/severe diseases. 
The interim analysis confirms the predominant circulation of 20H/501Y.V2 in South Africa (86/91 
sequences found, 31 vs 55 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively), the D614G-carrying 
“WT/ref” strain in the US (190/197 sequences found, 48 vs 142 in the vaccine and placebo groups 
respectively), and the P.2 (D614G + E484K) lineage in Brazil (86/124 sequences found, 27 vs 59 in 
the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). The remaining 38/124 sequences found are the Wuhan-
Hu1 reference sequence+D614G (10 vs 28 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). The 
20I/501Y.V1 (UK variant) and the 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazilian P.1 variant) were not found in the analysed 
samples. 
Sequence data was not yet available for all cases and a higher number of samples were sequenced in 
the placebo group when compared to the vaccine group, which could lead to biases. Therefore, an 
analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS-CoV-2 variant is planned upon completion of sequencing. 
Vaccine efficacy against severe/Critical COVID-19 by subgroups: 
Efficacy against severe disease by age and by comorbidities. 
For cases with onset >14 days, efficacy was also demonstrated against molecularly confirmed 
severe/critical COVID-19 in the 18-59 years, and ≥60 years, as well as in participants with and without 
comorbidities. Efficacy was 80.5% (95% CI: 57.82; 92.10) in participants 18-59 years of age and 
68.5% (95% CI: 18.07; 89.72) in participants ≥60 years of age.  
For cases with onset >28 days, for participants ≥60 years of age, and for participants with 
comorbidities, the lower bound of the 95% CI was <0% (low number of cases). 
Point estimates were slightly lower for the older vs. younger adults (with the 60 years cut-off or the 65 
years cut of), and for those with vs. without comorbidities. 
Differences were smaller in the extended dataset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 128/218 
 
 
 
In conclusion, efficacy against severe COVID-19 was observed in the participants <60 years, as in 
those ≥60 years, with no indication of a marked decrease in efficacy over age. Efficacy was also 
observed in participants with comorbidities. This was a descriptive analysis (non-inferential). 
Efficacy against severe disease by country: 
For cases with onset at least 14 days, efficacy against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID-19 
was 73.7% (33.58; 91.24) in South Africa, 71.7% (9.81; 93.21) in the US and 93.7% (59.62; 99.85) 
in Colombia. Results for cases at least 28 days after vaccination, and results in the extended data set 
also show efficacy against severe disease in South Africa. In the extended data set, point estimates are 
similar across the three countries, as shown in the table below. 
In conclusion, efficacy against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID-19 was observed in South 
Africa, with a point estimate that was similar compared to the US. CI are however very wide.

Vaccine impact on symptom severity and number of symptoms: 
Symptom severity was graded by the participants in the Symptoms of Infection with Coronavirus-19 
(SIC) questionnaire. Participants with a COVID-19 episode are invited to respond daily if he/she had 
any of a list of prespecified signs or symptoms during the past 24 hours. The SIC consists of 3 
separate parts (symptoms rated from 0 to 10 as part 1, fever as part 2, and 4 separate symptoms as 
part 3) that are scored separately. If a symptom is present, the participant has to rate the severity on 
a 10-point scale (from none to 10 worst possible). Fever was to be scored (fever score) as the 
maximum recorded temperature for each day during the COVID-19 episode. The participant also 
indicated if each of the 4 specific symptoms (i.e. uncontrollable body shaking/shivering, decreased 
sense of smell, decreased sense of taste, red or bruised looking feet or toes) is either present or 
absent (from 0 to 3, 0 corresponding to none and 3 to severe). The SIC questionnaire was not always 
completed (such as when a participant was hospitalised and unable to complete the questionnaire). 
The total SIC score was calculated for each day of the COVID-19 episode as the mean of all scores. It 
is however assumed that only the first part was used for the score (with symptoms rated from 0-10). 
In participants with moderate COVID-19 (>14 days), a slight reduction of symptom severity in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group is observed, over the first week of the episode. No 
difference is observed as of one week (symptoms are reported up to 6 weeks), and the SIC AUC was 
similar in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group. 
A post-hoc analysis compared the number of symptoms reported by breakthrough cases. As expected, 
many cases reported many symptoms. Fewer symptoms were reported in breakthrough cases of 
moderate disease for vaccinated compared to placebo subjects. Consistently, efficacy tended to

increase with an increasing number of symptoms. The interpretation of these data is difficult to 
reconcile with the fact efficacy could be similar in asymptomatic vs. symptomatic cases.

Impact of Ad26.COV2.S vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 viral load: 
Nasal swab samples were taken at the start of the COVID-19 episode and every 2 days thereafter until 
resolution. Saliva swabs were taken every 2 days as of Day 3-5. At this stage, viral load results are 
preliminary. Not all samples were analyzed at all timepoints for all participants yet. The full viral load 
profile across the COVID-19 episode was available for 100 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 
274 participants in the placebo group with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 with onset at least 14 
days after vaccination (which is the majority of the 116 Ad26COV vs. 348 Placebo cases). 
These preliminary data suggest no impact of vaccination on the SARS-CoV-2 viral load levels and 
duration in COVID-19 breakthrough cases.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy results were generated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study in 
adults ≥18 years of age (COV3001). The study was conducted in the US, several Latin American 
countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia), and South Africa. Participants were 
randomised in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp or placebo 
intramuscularly. Participants were not selected based on anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology. Participants with 
stable medical conditions were allowed to participate in the study, but those with an abnormal function 
of the immune system resulting from a clinical conditions or drugs were excluded. The target sample 
size for the study was approximately 40,000 participants. Randomisation was stratified by site, age

group (≥18-<60 years of age vs ≥60 years of age), and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or 
might be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19.  
During the assessment of the cMA, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been granted an Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) in the USA (on February 27, 2021). The applicant, as already planned initially, has 
submitted two amendments (for study 3001 and for study 1001) to indicate that Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 
will be offered to enrolled participants who initially received placebo, and that participants and 
investigators will be unblinded. All participants will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue 
to be followed for efficacy/effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity as originally planned for up to 2 
years post-vaccination. The crossover will result in loss of placebo-controlled follow up. The approach is 
acceptable considering the circumstances. The inclusion of effectiveness studies (US and EU/UK) in the 
PhV plan is highly supported. 
The primary objective of study COV3001 is to evaluate the efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention 
of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 (with onset at least 14 days post-
vaccination and with onset at least 28 days post-vaccination as co-primary endpoints), as compared to 
placebo, in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults. The secondary objectives include the evaluation of 
efficacy in the prevention of molecularly confirmed: (i) severe/critical COVID-19, (ii) mild COVID-19, 
(iii) COVID-19 as defined by the US CDC (FDA) harmonised case definition, (iv) all symptomatic 
COVID-19 (meeting the mild, moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 case definition), in SARS-CoV-2 
seronegative adults, (v) COVID-19 requiring medical intervention. In addition, the evaluation of the 
effect of Ad26.COV2.S on the occurrence of confirmed asymptomatic/undetected infections with SARS-
CoV-2 (using SARS-CoV-2 N protein seroconversion) was part of the secondary objectives. The study 
does not plan for an evaluation effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load in asymptomatic cases. Viral load 
will be assessed as part of the secondary objectives in moderate to severe/critical COVID-19. The 
assessment of efficacy in participants with comorbidities and according to the degree of frailty are 
relevant exploratory objectives. Frailty has been shown to be an important factor of mortality, 
independent of age and other comorbidities2. Overall, the study objectives allow for a comprehensive 
insight into the effect of Ad26.COV2.S on the whole spectrum of COVID-19 illness.  
Study procedures allowed for the active surveillance of COVID-19 signs and symptoms, swabbing and 
virological confirmation of the cases. A broad pre-defined list of symptoms/signs possibly associated 
with COVID-19 (symptoms from the CDC list and additional symptoms) was used for triggering 
swabbing to maximise the detection of COVID-19 cases. The study procedures to identify and 
document the COVID-19 events are deemed appropriate and sufficiently detailed. 
Confirmation testing was done by a central lab at Washington University, using the Tier-1 Abbott 
Realtime SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, which is multi-target PCR’s. Performance data (cross-reactivity 
and clinical performance) are acceptable. The selected PCR test does not use Spike/RBD targets which 
minimises the risk of false-negatives as a result of circulating variants with S-dropout. PCR may 
underperform when mutations appear in the primer/probe target regions, but this risk is mitigated by 
using dual target detection.  
Gene sequencing for the identification of the variants was restricted to the Spike region only. The Swift 
Biosciences SNAP version 2.0 kit was used on an Illumina sequencing platform. Because the most 
critical mutations for antibody evasion are located in the Spike protein, the interim analyses on Spike 
sequences only is sufficient for the time being. The validation document should be provided with the 
final report (REC).

The case definition of moderate COVID-19 includes two sets of criteria using a combination of 
symptoms and signs. Considering that it is unlikely that mild symptoms occur isolated, it is unclear 
whether there is an added value (in terms of clinical relevance/specificity) of requiring a combination of 
symptoms/signs. It is also unclear why the applicant did not use a definition of ‘moderate COVID-19’ 
requiring that the first set of criteria is met (irrespective of the presence of mild symptoms/signs), 
more in line with the NIH definition of moderate COVID-19. Instead, at the moment, cases that would 
be considered mild disease by other case definitions (i.e. only including symptoms compatible with 
COVID-19 but without signs of LRT involvement) can meet the protocol definition of moderate disease. 
In conclusion, the applicant used a complex composite definition of moderate COVID-19, of unclear 
added value. 
The definition for severe/critical COVID-19 is in line with the definition of severe COVID-19 in the FDA 
guidance on Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (June 2020). All potential 
severe/critical COVID-19 cases are adjudicated in a blinded manner by the Clinical Severity 
Adjudication Committee (CSAC). The applicant indicated that data on the WHO progression scale could 
not be provided (data were not captured).  
The co-primary endpoints consist in a combination of moderate COVID-19 and severe/critical COVID-
19, and moderate COVID-19 itself is a composite endpoint. It is not in line with the guidance ‘EMA 
considerations on COVID-19 vaccine approval’ which recommends using ‘laboratory-confirmed COVID-
19 disease of any severity’ as the primary endpoint. Limitations were raised in the EMA Rapid scientific 
advice (EMEA/H/SA/4470/1/FU/1/2020/III). The applicant was advised to consider a simple definition 
of COVID-19 of any severity, in line with current ECDC, CDC or WHO definitions. This advice was not 
followed, but in practice, the classification of the cases was very similar when using the primary 
endpoint case definition or the case definition of ‘all symptomatic COVID-19 cases’, or the CDC/FDA 
harmonised case definition. 
Therefore, the wording ‘COVID-19’ is used for the primary endpoint in the SmPC in line with the 
indication. It would be considered misleading to use the wording ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-
19’ as it could suggest that the cases corresponding to the primary endpoint tended to be more severe 
compared to other vaccines, while it is not the case.  
The case definition of ‘asymptomatic or undetected SARS-COV-2’ combining either seroconversion in 
terms of antibodies against non-S protein (based on systematic sampling in all participants) and/or 
positive PCR (based on ‘accidental’ detection of asymptomatic cases) in the absence of criteria for 
suspected COVID-19 based on the signs and symptoms list is supported. The identification of 
asymptomatic cases thus mainly relies on SARS-CoV-2 non-S protein seroconversion. A Nucleocapsid 
protein (NP)-based assay (ELISA N protein assay) was used which is a validated assay, with FDA EUA 
approval. As routinely testing all asymptomatic participants using swab and PCR testing, despite 
preferable for a clearer understanding of the impact on asymptomatic infection, is logistically 
challenging, the applicant’s approach is deemed acceptable. However, this will only provide indirect 
indications about the effect on the risk of infection. More robust estimation of the vaccine’s effect on 
carriage and shedding should be planned. The indirect effect of vaccination on unvaccinated persons, 
should be studied as well.  
From a statistical point of view, this is a fully sequential trial in which the statistical boundaries were 
based on a truncated sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Two co-primary endpoints were 
predefined based on the case definition with onset of at least 14- and 28-days post-vaccination, in the 
per protocol population set at an overall 2.5% one-sided alpha level. The trial positiveness was 
predefined for a simultaneously superiority for the two co-primary endpoints against the null value of 
30% VE, with both point estimates >50% VE, and ≥5 cases in the placebo arm.

The applicant decided to perform no snapshot analysis but only the primary analysis when the 2-month 
median follow-up timepoint was reached (database cut-off date: 22 January 2021). Up to the cut-off 
date, 259 cases meeting the primary endpoints definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 
were observed for events with onset at least 28 days after vaccination, exceeding the targeted 
prespecified number of 154 cases.  
The applicant provided the evolution of the different timepoints of the primary analysis on a cumulative 
basis, from the beginning of the trial, including when the interim analysis was conducted with the 
minimal data requirements (17/01/2021) and all final available data used in the primary analysis 
(22/01/2021) 
The overrunning is due to the high number of cases cumulated between the data when minimal data 
requirements for triggering the IA were met (17/01/2021) and the date of data cut-off (22/01/2021). 
Thus, the overrunning was apparently due to the high number of cases cumulated in just 5 days. Also, 
there was an unavoidable slight delay needed for the confirmation on the adjudicated cases. In the 
end, it is understood that some overrunning would have been impossible to avoid given the high 
incidence rates derived from the epidemiological curves. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 43,783 randomised participants received the study vaccine (21,895 and 21,888 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms). This constitutes the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The primary analysis of 
VE was based on the Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population, which includes only participants that were 
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Of the participants in the FAS, 19,630 (89.7%) and 19,691 
(90.0%) were included in PP, respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms (total of 39,321). 
Baseline seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was the main reason for elimination from the PP set (n=4,217) 
and/or being PCR positive at baseline the second reason (n=238). Other reasons were major protocol 
deviations. Reasons for elimination from the PP were balanced across groups. In the FAS, 1,080 
(4.9%) and 1,177 (5.4%) participants were unblinded respectively in the vaccine and placebo arms 
due to request by participants who became eligible to receive an authorised/licensed COVID-19 
vaccine. Very few subjects terminated participation prematurely at the time of data cut-off point for 
the primary analysis (in the FAS 0.2% vs. 0.4%). The main reason for termination was withdrawal by 
subject. 
The study was conducted in the US (44%), various countries of Latin America (41%), and South Africa. 
The representation of South Africa was substantial (15% in the FAS). The proportion of participants 
≥60 years was 35% (in the PP) and the proportion of individuals ≥65 years was 20%. The proportion 
of subjects ≥75 years was however limited (4% in the PP). Of the participants, 45% were females. 
There were only few long-term care residents: 0.3% (n=63) vs. 0.4% (n=85) in respective groups 
(FAS). Participants with comorbidities were well represented. At least one comorbidity was present in 
40%-41% (PP-FAS), the most common being obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 28%-29% in the PP-FAS), 
hypertension (10%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.5%), followed by serious heart conditions (2.5%), 
HIV infection (2.5%), asthma (1.5%), COPD (1%). Only very few participants presented comorbidities 
that are susceptible to significantly affect the immune system (0.2% immunodeficiency condition, 
<0.1% secondary immunodeficiency, 0.5% malignant neoplasm and 0.5% chronic kidney disease). 
Only 3% of the subject present 3 or more comorbidities at baseline. The applicant is planning an 
immunogenicity study in immunocompromised individuals in the PM period.  
Baseline characteristics were well balanced across arms, overall and within regions.

Co-Primary endpoint: 
Overall, in the PP respectively 54.6% of the Ad26.COV2.S and 54.7% of the placebo participants had a 
follow-up of at least 2 months after vaccination (calculated as 8 weeks) at the time of the primary 
analysis. The median follow-up time after vaccination was 58.0 days in both arms.  
For the primary endpoint (‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’) with an onset beyond Day 14, 
efficacy was 66.9% (Adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40). For the primary endpoint with an onset beyond 
Day 28, efficacy was 66.1% (Adjusted 95% CI: 55.01; 74.80). Of the 116 vs. 348 cases with an onset 
beyond Day 14 (respectively in the vaccine vs the placebo group), 66 vs. 193 cases occurred beyond 
Day 28 (hence nearly half occurred in the period 15-28 days, i.e. 50 vs. 155). The lower limit (LL) of 
the CI was well above the pre-specified limit of 30%. Therefore, the primary objective was met for 
both co-primary endpoints. 
Symptomatic COVID-19 (any severity): 
The number of cases and level of efficacy was consistent by using the US FDA Harmonized COVID-19 
case definition (67.2% [95% CI: 59.32; 73.67] based on 114 vs. 345 cases >14 days, 66.7% [95% 
CI: 55.63; 75.23] based on 65 vs. 193 >28 days).  
The endpoint ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ cases (of any severity) included cases classified as either mild, 
or moderate to severe/critical (per protocol definitions). At least 14 days after vaccination, there were 
only 1 and 3 mild cases respectively in the active vs. placebo group, in addition to the 116 vs. 348 
cases that met the primary endpoint case definition. The vast majority of ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ 
cases were thus captured by the primary endpoint. Therefore, the level of efficacy against 
‘symptomatic COVID-19’ was the nearly identical (66.9% [95% CI: 59.07; 73.37]) >14 days, and 
66.5% [95% CI: 55.50; 75.05] >28 days) as the level of efficacy against the primary endpoint. 
Number of cases and efficacy were thus in line across the primary endpoint and the secondary 
endpoints ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ and ‘COVID-19 by FDA harmonised definition’, as those endpoints 
actually overlap. 
Moderate COVID-19: 
Of the primary endpoint ‘moderate to severe/critical’ COVID-19 cases that occurred at least 14 days 
after vaccination, most (102 [88%] vs. 288 [83%]) were classified ‘moderate COVID-19’. The VE 
results for ‘moderate COVID-19’ cases were of 64.8% (95% CI: 55.75, 72.21) and 62.0% (95% CI: 
48.68, 72.21) from at least 14 and 28 days, respectively, post-vaccination. The applicant presented 
post-hoc VE data for participants who only met the first set of symptoms of the ‘moderate COVID-19’ 
definition, corresponding to the NIH definition (denoted ‘Moderate Part 1’). These cases represented 
only about a third of the primary endpoint cases (40 [34%] vs. 125 [36%]). The VE (95% CI) for 
Moderate Part 1 cases with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days post-vaccination was 68.1% 
(95% CI: 54.14, 78.24) and 72.6% (95% CI: 55.12, 83.96), respectively.  
Severe COVID-19: 
Efficacy against severe disease was demonstrated, beyond 14 days and beyond 28 days after 
vaccination, over a median follow up duration of 58 days. Of the 116 vs. 348 primary endpoint cases 
with an onset at least 14 days after vaccination, 14 (12%) vs. 60 (17%) were classified as 
severe/critical (further referred to as severe). The point estimate of VE against severe disease was 
76.7% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09). Of the 66 vs. 193 primary endpoint cases with an onset at 
least 28 days after vaccination, 5 (8%) vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe/critical. VE against 
severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.15; 96.90). Severe disease was a 
prespecified inferential endpoint. The lower limit of the 95% CI of 55% was well above 30% for both 
endpoints (the prespecified LL was only 0%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 139/218 
 
 
 
Of the 14 vs. 60 severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
vs. placebo group, 2 vs. 6 were hospitalised. Three died (all in the placebo group). Based on the data 
provided during the assessment, it appears that most of the cases were classified as ‘severe’ based 
only on abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (SpO2<93%) self-measured (at home). The self-
measured SpO2 were not necessarily confirmed by a healthcare worker and values are not corrected 
for altitude. The CSAS was responsible for taking altitude into account. During the COVID-19 event, at 
least one measurement was nevertheless taken by the investigator’s site or by a home visit by 
investigator’s personnel. All cases were adjudicated as severe based on the clinical independent 
judgment of the adjudicators, who took into account the overall clinical history of the case. The roles of 
the Committee and the names of the experts have been provided. Upon request, the Company clarified 
that all severe cases have an objective finding of low SpO2 or other abnormal sign but that the 
rationale for the severity assessment was not recorded in the clinical database. Certainly, it would have 
been desirable to have that information. 
Hospitalisation: 
Beyond 14 days and 28 days after vaccination, there were 2 vs. 8 and 0 vs. 5 cases of molecularly 
confirmed COVID-19 requiring medical intervention (as collected via the MRU Form), respectively in 
the Ad26.COV2.S vs. placebo group. These cases involved hospitalisation only, except one case in the 
placebo group who required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. In addition, 2 hospitalised 
cases in the placebo group were not classified severe. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed COVID-19 
events requiring hospitalisation at least 14 days after vaccination, was estimated at 75.0% (95% CI: -
25.28; 97.41). This result was non-conclusive, but in line with the point estimate for severe disease. 
The finding was supported by post-hoc analyses of all COVID-19 related hospitalisations implementing 
a broader search based on all available information from any source in which there was a favorable 
case split between the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups (beyond 14 days after vaccination 2 vs. 29 in 
extended data set). 
Onset of protection and duration of protection: 
The cumulative incidence curves of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases 
(Kaplan Meier) for the placebo and vaccinated groups start to separate at Day 14, suggesting that the 
onset of protection is at that time. A plot modelling the difference between the curves suggests that 
protection is starting to be established around Day 14 and increases up to Day 28-35, presumably 
related to maturation of functional immune responses and then stabilises up to Day 56.  
How protection persists beyond 8 weeks remains to be addressed with study COV3001 (specific 
obligation).  
Efficacy by level of severity: 
Whether efficacy is higher against severe cases vs. against mild/moderate symptomatic cases is not 
confirmed yet, but there is a trend it that direction. It is plausible that the immunity induced by 
vaccination could in some instances be insufficient to prevent mild disease (that is counted in the 
primary endpoint) but sufficient to prevent the infection evolving into more severe COVID-19 disease. 
Consistently, efficacy tended to increase with an increasing number of symptoms.  
Asymptomatic or undetected cases: 
Day 71 samples were available for 2,892 participants, which is only about 6% of the FAS seronegative 
and 19% of the number of samples required for the confirmatory analysis of the ‘asymptomatic or 
undetected’ endpoint (15,000 participants who have reached the Day 71 visit).  
Over the period Day 1 – Day 29, the efficacy point estimate was 12.5% (inconclusive) for the 
prevention of asymptomatic/undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 13.1% (inconclusive) for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 140/218 
 
 
 
endpoint ‘seroconversion only’. In contrast, over the period >28 days, efficacy was 59.7% (95% CI: 
32.75; 76.64) for the prevention of undetected/asymptomatic cases, and efficacy in terms of 
‘seroconversion only’ was 65.5% (95% CI: 39.91; 81.08). Most of the ‘asymptomatic or undetected 
SARS-CoV-2 infections’ were seroconverters (22 vs. 54 asymptomatic/undetected cases in the vaccine 
vs. the placebo group, of which 18 vs. 50 were seroconverters). The algorithm in the SAP identified 
asymptomatic participants as those who had no symptoms on the day preceding, the day of, or any 
time after a positive RT-PCR test. A sensitivity analysis was performed restricted to the participants 
without any COVID-19 symptoms since screening and yielded generally similar findings.  
Findings related to asymptomatic cases based on N protein serology data are very preliminary. These 
preliminary data are promising, as they suggest efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection, 
at a level that may be consistent with efficacy against symptomatic disease, but this needs to be 
confirmed over a longer follow with a larger dataset.  
Viral load during COVID-19 episodes: 
The full viral load profile across the COVID-19 episode was available for a large proportion of the 
cases. The preliminary data suggest no impact of vaccination on the SARS-CoV-2 viral load levels and 
duration in COVID-19 breakthrough cases.  
Extended data set: 
Due to the delay needed to obtain the results from the central lab (average of 14 days), many cases 
were not confirmed yet at the time of the primary analysis. A repeat of the analysis was performed in 
which all COVID-19 cases with a positive PCR result were analysed, including all cases with a local lab 
result, not yet confirmed by the central laboratory. This analysis is referred to as the extended dataset 
analysis. The total number of cases observed >14 days by this ‘extended’ definition is 173 in the 
vaccine group and 509 in the placebo group (i.e. 47 and 131 additional cases). Overall, the primary 
endpoint analyses and the secondary analyses symptomatic cases are supported by the analysis in the 
extended data set.  
Cases in seropositive subjects: 
Of the 4,156 participants SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, 7 (0.17%) COVID-19 cases were 
reported as PCR positive from any source (3 vs. 4 in the active vs. placebo group after Day 14) of 
which one was confirmed by the central laboratory over the study period. In contrast, of the 19,822 
placebo subjects in the FAS, 617 PCR positive cases were reported from any source (3.11%) over the 
approximately two-months study period (average incidence of 19.5 per 100 Person-Years).  
Efficacy by age and comorbidities: 
The efficacy against molecularly confirmed ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ at least 14 days and 
at least 28 days after vaccination was established in the ≥60 years participants. For events >14 days, 
efficacy was 76.3% (95% CI: 61.58; 86.04) in participants ≥60 years and 63.7% (95% CI: 53.87; 
71.58) in participants 18-59 years. Overall, these results provide clear support for indicating the 
vaccine in subjects older than 60 years, which is one of the main groups that are at high risk of 
developing severe COVID-19 complications. 
Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 was observed both in 
participants with and without comorbidities (point estimates 62.9% and 69.1% for cases with onset at 
least 14 days after vaccination, and 48.6% and 72.6% for cases with onset at least 28 days after 
vaccination, for participants with and without comorbidities respectively). The VE point estimates were 
lower for the participants ‘with’ vs. ‘without’ comorbidities, including when stratifying by age (18-59 
years vs. ≥60+ and 18-64 years vs. ≥65 years). When considering efficacy >28 days (where the 
numbers of events are the lowest) for the older participants with comorbidities, the lower limit of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

95% CI was <0. For those cases with onset at least 28 days efficacy was 33.2% (95% CI: -77.59; 
76.33) for participants ≥60 years and 44.0% (-85.99; 85.26) for participants ≥65 years. The 95% CI 
are very wide, and estimates are based on few events. The same pattern was found in the extended 
data set, although differences were less marked. It is not considered that there is an efficacy concern 
in certain subgroups such as older patients with comorbidities. In addition, given the nature of the 
comorbidities (no immunocompromised participants), there is low biological plausibility for an efficacy 
issue in these participants. Moreover, efficacy cannot be assessed in participants with ≥3 comorbidities 
due to the limited number of cases. 
Data from subgroups are currently considered preliminary. Length of follow up was the shortest for 
participants in the older age group (≥60 years of age), especially for those with comorbidities. 
Differences across subgroups may be strongly influenced by differences in follow up duration. 
Differences in terms of timing of vaccination could also affect the interpretation of subgroup analyses 
across age groups and across participants with/without comorbidities (given the emergence of variants 
for which efficacy could vary). Efficacy by age and comorbidities will need to be assessed over a longer 
follow-up time to generate more robust estimates. More robust data are expected to be provided in the 
final report of study COV3001 (SOB). It is noted that follow-up duration may remain an important 
issue for interpretation of the results in the future given that the elderly participants and those with 
comorbidities will be unblinded and cross-vaccinated earlier in the trial. Therefore, this should also be 
addressed in effectiveness studies. 
Efficacy by country and circulating variants: 
Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 was demonstrated in each 
participating country. Except for South Africa, all point estimates were >65% for events with onset at 
least 14 days after vaccination (not computed in Chile and Mexico due to small numbers). In South 
Africa, efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries (39.6% [95% CI: 8.77; 
60.46] for cases with onset at least 14 days and 57.3% [95% CI: 26.51; 76.03] for cases with onset 
at least 28 days after vaccination). Heterogeneity across regions is much less marked when 
considering the extended data set (South Africa: 52.0% [95% CI: 30.26; 67.44] for cases with onset 
at least 14 days, 64.0% [95% CI: 41.19; 78.66] for cases with onset at least 28 days after 
vaccination).  
There was emergence of new variants reported during the period of the study, especially in South 
Africa. The applicant performed a sequence analysis restricted to the Spike region. The interim 
analysis, based on available sequences of approximatively 70% of the cases, confirms the predominant 
circulation of 20H/501Y.V2 in South Africa (86/91 [94.5%] sequences found, 31 vs 55 in the vaccine 
and placebo groups respectively) and the D614G-carrying “WT/ref” strain in the US (190/197 [96.4%] 
sequences found, 48 vs 142 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). There was no 
predominant variant in Brazil, but the P.2 (D614G + E484K) lineage represented two third of the cases 
in Brazil (86/124 sequences found, 27 vs 59 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). 
At the time of the current analysis cut-off, analysis of efficacy per variant was not performed. Spike 
sequence data were available for only 70% of the cases and a higher proportion of samples were 
sequenced in the placebo group when compared to the vaccine group, which could lead to biases. 
Therefore, an analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS-CoV-2 variant is planned upon completion of 
sequencing  
It assumed that the efficacy observed participants living in South Africa is mainly attributable to the SA 
variant of concern, as this variant was predominant in this country. Efficacy against molecularly 
confirmed severe/critical COVID-19 was observed in South Africa, with a point estimate that was 
similar compared to the US. CI are however very wide. Therefore, the efficacy results obtained are

important in that this vaccine would provide relevant protection in case the South African variant 
spreads to other countries. Data suggest that onset of protection occurs later in South Africa (around 
28 days while overall the onset of protection occurs a 14 days).  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The final clinical study report for study VAC31518COV3001 will be submitted no later than December 
2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA, to provide long term follow up data, 
including data to confirm efficacy in subgroups or data on specific endpoints that were not yet available 
at the time this assessment was carried out.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 was demonstrated in SARS-COV-
2 seronegative individuals, over a median follow up period of 8 weeks in a large multiregional trial. 
Efficacy point estimates were 66.9% and 66.1% for the co-primary endpoints ‘moderate to 
severe/critical COVID-19’ with an onset beyond Day 14 and Day 28 respectively. The study showed 
conclusive evidence since both co-primary efficacy endpoints were met. Efficacy was consistent, with 
point estimates 65% to 70%, for the various definitions of COVID-19 used in the trial. 
The vaccine prevented severe disease. The majority of severe events observed in the trial consisted of 
COVID-19 with abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (SpO2<93%) often based on participant self-
measures. All cases were adjudicated as severe based on the clinical independent clinical judgment of 
the adjudicators. There was a favourable case split between the vaccine and placebo groups in terms 
of hospitalised COVID-19. Efficacy point estimates tend to increase with the level of severity of the 
case definition. 
Efficacy was observed in the elderly. Efficacy was also observed in participants with common and 
stable comorbidities. No data is available for immunocompromised participants.  
Efficacy was established in the various regions, including South Africa although at a lower level. New 
variants were emerging during the study period, and most of the strains circulating in South Africa 
were the variant of concern 20H/501Y.V2.  
Findings related to asymptomatic cases based on N protein serology data are too preliminary to 
conclude. These preliminary data are nevertheless promising, as they suggest efficacy against 
asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection, at a level that may be consistent with efficacy against 
symptomatic disease.  
Overall,  all  these  efficacy  data  provide  strong  evidence  for  approval  of  this  vaccine  for  prevention  of 
COVID-19 in subjects of 18 years and older. Of importance, protection in older adults and in subjects 
infected with a variant (South Africa) SARS-CoV-2 is also demonstrated. 
More robust data on efficacy by age and comorbidities are nevertheless expected to be provided in the 
final report, as well as against the variants. 
The duration of protection is not known.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: the MAH should submit the final clinical study report for the randomised, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind study VAC31518COV3001. The study subjects are expected to be 
followed for 24 months after the first dose.

2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Overall, 54,586 adults ≥18 years received Ad26.COV2.S or placebo regardless of the dose level or 
schedule in studies VAC31518COV3001, VAC31518COV3009, VAC31518COV2001, VAC31518COV1002 
and VAC31518COV1001 up cut-off date (22th January 2021) (of which 17,940 participants were ≥60 
years of age, 10,746 were ≥65 years, and 1,848 were ≥75 years). Of these 54,586 adults, 1,596 
adults received 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S or placebo. 
An overview of the safety database for participants that received 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S up to the

f Includes exposure to a single-dose or 2-dose vaccination regimen with Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level 
(5x1010 vp) with at least a 28-day interval between doses for the 2-dose regimen. 
Main clinical study: VAC31518COV3001 
In COV3001, a total of 44,325 participants were randomised of whom 43,783 were vaccinated (21,895 
in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group and 21,888 in the placebo group) and included in the Full analysis 
set (FAS). Of these 43,783 participants, 6,736 (3,356 in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group and 3,380 
in the placebo group) were included in the safety subset. Of the participants in the FAS, none had 
completed the study at the time of the analysis.  
Of the participants in the FAS, 49 subjects (0.2%) in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group and 96 
subjects (0.4%) in the placebo group, had discontinued the study prematurely, mainly due to 
Assessment report

withdrawal of consent (35 [0.2%] participants and 66 [0.3%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S and 
placebo group, respectively). 
At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow-up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. 
Longer safety follow-up of >2 months is available for 23,903 participants in the FAS: 11,948 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (54.6%) and 11,955 in the placebo group (54.6%). However, 
only 34 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.2%) and 31 in the placebo group (0.1%) have been 
followed for close to 4 months. Long-term safety is identified as a missing information in the RMP. 
Demographic and baseline: Main clinical study: VAC31518COV3001 
In the FAS, with a median age of 52 years of age, there were 21,895 adults ≥18 years of age, 
including 17,636 adults 18-64 years of age (80.5%) and 4,259 adults ≥65 years of age (19.5%) (with 
809 adults ≥75 years of age - 3.7%), including 8,936 adults with comorbidities (40.8%) (with 2,271 
adults ≥65 years of age with comorbidities – 10.4%), and including 2,151 adults seropositive at 
baseline (9.8%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp. 
In the safety subset, with a median age of 54, there were 3,356 adults ≥18 years of age, including 
2,593 adults 18-64 years of age (77.3%) and 763 adults ≥65 years of age (22.7%) (with 150 adults 
≥75 years of age – 4.5%), and including 1,135 adults with comorbidities (33.8%) (with 341 adults 
≥65 years of age with comorbidities – 10.2%), and including 154 adults seropositive at baseline 
(4.6%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp. 
There were 1,320 subjects ≥60 years of age in Ad26.COV2.S group and 1,331 subjects ≥60 years of 
age in placebo group. This is in line with protocol requirements which requested to have at least 2,000 
elderly participants ≥60 years of age without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of 
progression to severe COVID-19 among the approximately 6,000 participants in the safety subset 
(including approximately 1,000 Ad26.COV2.S recipients and approximately 1,000 placebo recipients). 
In the FAS and the safety subset, the demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among 
participants who received Ad26.COV2.S or placebo 
The demographic profile of Ad26.COV2.S was generally similar between the safety subset and the FAS, 
with the exception of race, country, and serostatus at baseline. In the FAS, participants were mainly 
from US (44.1%), Brazil (16.6%), South Africa (15%); in addition to Colombia (9.7%), Argentina 
(6.8%), Peru (4%), Chile (2.6%) and Mexico (1.1%). In the safety subset were included only 
participants from the US (51.5%), Brazil (38.5%) and South Africa (10.1%), for practical reason (Cf. 
methodology section). In the safety subset, the proportion of White participants was greater (83.4%) 
compared to the FAS (58.7%). The proportion of participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at 
baseline was lower (4.6%) compared to the FAS (9.6%). 
Demographic and baseline: Other clinical studies 
In the Phase 1 and 2 studies (VAC31518COV1001 [Cohorts 1a and 3], VAC31518COV1002, and 
VAC31518COV2001), demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between 
the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine groups and the placebo groups. In Studies VAC31518COV1001 and 
VAC31518COV2001, most participants were white. Study VAC31518COV1002 was conducted in Japan 
only. In study VAC31518COV2001, the proportion of males was 63.4 % versus 36.6% of females. 
In study VAC31518COV1001 Cohort 1b (participants aged ≥18 to ≤55 years), a total of 25 participants 
were randomised and vaccinated. By the cut-off date of 11/01/2021, all participants had completed the 
study treatment or had discontinued early. Overall, 56.0% of participants were female and 44.0% 
were male. The median age was 42 years (range: 22 to 52 years) and the median BMI was 24.8 kg/m2 
(range: 18.8 to 29.9 kg/m2). Most participants were White (88.0%).

Solicited Adverse Events 
Study VAC31518COV3001 
In study VAC31518COV3001 solicited adverse events were collected in the safety subset group 
During the 7-day post-vaccination period, the frequency of solicited AEs was higher in participants in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group (66%), compared to participants in the placebo group (41.9%) (mainly grade 
1 and 2) in the safety subset group.

Solicited local reactions 
During the 7-day post-vaccination period, the frequency of solicited local AEs was higher in participants 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group (50.3%), compared to participants in the placebo group (19.5%) (table 
below). The most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain with a frequency that 
was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (48.7%), compared to participants in the placebo 
group (16.7%). Vaccination site erythema (7.3% vs. 3.9%, respectively) and vaccination site swelling 
(5.3% vs. 1.6%) were also more frequent in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group. 
Local solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited local AEs 
was low overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to participants in the 
placebo group: vaccination site pain (0.3% vs. 0.1%, respectively), vaccination site erythema (0.2% 
vs. 0.1%), and vaccination site swelling (0.2% vs. 0.1%) (no grade 4). All solicited local AEs are 
considered related to study vaccination by definition. These local solicited AEs are adequately specified, 
with the appropriate frequencies, in the ADR table in the SmPC.

Figure 21: Presentation of Local Solicited Adverse Events by Worst Severity Grade After any 
Vaccination; Safety Subset (Study VAC31518COV3001) 
All solicited local AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. The median time to onset of 
the selected solicited local AEs was within 2 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (including day of 
vaccination), and within 1 to 2 days with placebo. 
The median duration for the most frequent solicited local AEs (vaccination site pain, vaccination site 
erythema) was 2 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S or placebo. The median duration for 
vaccination site swelling was 3 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S and 1 days after placebo. 
Solicited systemic reactions 
During the 7-day post-vaccination period, the frequency of solicited systemic AEs was higher in 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (55.2%), compared to participants in the placebo group 
(35.1%) (table below). The most frequently solicited systemic AEs were headache (39% in 
Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue (38.3% vs. 21.6%, respectively), and 
myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). Nausea were reported at 14.2% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 9.7% in the 
placebo group. Pyrexia (defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C, as recorded by the participants) was 
reported in 302 (9.0%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to 20 (0.6%) of participants 
in the placebo group. These systemic solicited AEs are adequately specified, with the appropriate 
frequencies, in the ADR table in the SmPC. 
Most solicited systemic AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity (no grade 4). The frequency of Grade 
3 solicited systemic AEs was low overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
compared to participants in the placebo group. The most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited 
systemic AEs reported for fatigue (35 participants – 1%) and myalgia (32 participants – 1%) during 
the 7-day postvaccination period. Grade 3 headache were reported by 23 subjects (0.7%), and grade 3 
nausea by 6 subjects (0.2%). Grade 3 pyrexia was reported in 8 (0.2%) participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group. Among these 8 participants, 7 participants were in the ≥18 to <60 years age

Figure 22: Graphical Presentation of Systemic Solicited Adverse Events by Worst Severity 
Grade After any Vaccination; Safety Subset (Study VAC31518COV3001) 
Most solicited systemic AEs after vaccination were considered to be related to study vaccine (98.16% 
(1819/1853) of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the study vaccine, and 95.2% 
(1131/1188) to the placebo). In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported solicited 
systemic AEs related to vaccination were headache (38.2%), fatigue (37.4%), and myalgia (32.6%). 
Related nausea was reported by 13.9%, and related pyrexia by 8.9%.

Regarding the severity, most Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were considered as related to 
Ade26.COV2.s, there was only one report of grade 3 headache that was not considered related to the 
study vaccine. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited systemic AEs 
related to vaccination were fatigue (1%), myalgia (1%) and headache (0.7%). Grade 3 related nausea 
and pyrexia were reported by 0.2% each.

Most solicited systemic AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Overall, the median 
duration of the selected solicited systemic AEs was similar in both groups (1 to 2 days after vaccination 
with Ad26.COV2.S or with placebo), and also the median time to onset (within 2 days after vaccination 
with Ad26.COV2.S and within 2 to 3 days after vaccination with placebo) 
Supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) 
Overall, the solicited and unsolicited AEs in supportive studies were consistent with the pivotal phase 3 
COV3001 study. 
Solicited AEs after dose 1 
In all supportive studies, most solicited local and systemic AEs were Grade 1 or 2. No grade 3 solicited 
local AEs were reported in COV1001 and COV2001, although, a 2% of the participants reported a 
Grade 3 vaccination site pain in COV1002. The frequency of subjects with any Grade 3 solicited 
systemic AE in COV1001 was 9.9% in cohort 1a and 0.6% in cohort 3; it was a 7.8% in COV1002 and 
a 2.9% in COV2001.  
Solicited AEs administered as 2-dose regimen 
Safety data of a 2-dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) administered at a 56-day interval was 
available from COV1001 in 77 adults ≥18 to ≤55 years (Cohort 1a) and 81 adults ≥65 years (Cohort 
3) of age. In general, no safety concerns were identified after vaccination with two doses of 
Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) at a 56-day interval, as no apparent difference was observed regarding the 
frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs, and unsolicited AEs, when comparing a one dose and

two dose regimens, in adults aged ≥18 to ≤55 and aged ≥65. There were slightly higher frequencies of 
solicited systemic AEs after post-dose 1 than after post-dose 2. The main difference was regarding 
pyrexia. All solicited local AEs and the majority of solicited systemic AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
Lower frequencies of Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were observed after a second vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S in both age groups.  
Unsolicited AEs 
Study VAC31518COV3001 
As defined in the protocol, for the participants in the safety subset, the investigator was to record 
systematically all unsolicited AEs, whether serious or non-serious from the time of vaccination until 28 
days post-vaccination. Without such a requirement for a systematic collection of all unsolicited events 
for those participants in the FAS who were not in the safety subset (although spontaneous unsolicited 
reports were captured in the eCRF), and although a much larger number of subjects have been 
vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S in FAS (21,895), the frequencies calculated in the safety subset (3,356 
subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S) is preferred (higher than in the FAS). The selection of 
unsolicited AEs to be presented in the ADR table in the SmPC was made applying the following criteria 
(all criteria had to be met): Event occurred with a frequency of at least 0.1% in the safety subset; The 
AE was not collected as a solicited AE (to avoid duplication of the event in both solicited and unsolicited 
sections); The unsolicited AE occurred at a higher frequency (of >0.1%) in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
compared to the placebo group; A medical review was done to establish plausible connection to the 
vaccine and to assess confounding factors. Moreover, it has been checked that the unsolicited AEs 
reported in Ad26.COV2.S FAS (applying the same criteria as for the safety subset) are also present in 
the ADR table. 
In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported during the 28-days post-vaccination 
period was similar for participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (13.1%) compared to participants in the 
placebo group (12%). In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs by PT 
(≥1.0% of participants) were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain, which were also 
recorded as solicited AEs. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the unsolicited ADRs (not recorded as solicited 
AEs) selected for the ADR table in the SmPC are chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, muscular 
weakness and pain in extremity (table below).

Most reported unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. There was as similar frequency of 
participants with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both group (0.6% in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 
0.5% in the placebo group). 
The frequency of unsolicited AEs that were considered related to vaccination was higher in participants 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group (7.2%) compared to participants in the placebo group (4.6%) (table below). 
There was an imbalance between vaccine and placebo in related unsolicited AEs (difference ≥ 2 related 
events in favour of vaccine group) observed for cough (12 related with vaccine vs. 4 in placebo), 
sneezing (10 vs. 8), oropharyngeal pain (5 vs. 1), tremor (3 vs. 1), back pain (3 vs. 1) and 
hyperhidrosis (2 vs. 0). These related events have been appropriately added in the ADR table in

Supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) 
Unsolicited AEs after dose 1 
In all studies, most solicited local AEs were Grade 1 or 2. No grade 3 unsolicited AEs (related or not) 
were reported with dose level 5x1010 vp of Ade26.COV2.S in COV1002 and COV2001. However, in 
COV1001, only 2 participants in each age group reported severe related unsolicited AEs. 
Unsolicited AEs administered as 2-dose regimen 
Safety data of a 2-dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) administered at a 56-day interval was 
available from COV1001 in adults ≥18 to ≤55 years (Cohort 1a) and ≥65 years (Cohort 3) of age. 
There was no apparent difference in the frequencies of unsolicited AEs after vaccination with 5x1010 vp 
Ad26.COV2.S post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 in adults ≥18 to ≤55 years of age. There was 
slightly higher frequency of unsolicited AEs in participants who received 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S. after 
dose 1 than after dose 2 in adults ≥65 years of age. Most unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. Lower frequencies of Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were observed after a second vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S in both age groups.

2.6.3.  Immediate adverse events 
In the main study COV3001, the first 2,000 participants in each of the 2 age groups (≥18 to <60 years 
and ≥60 years) remained under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes after vaccination 
to monitor for immediate reactions. No early onset had been observed in either age group at the time 
of the Day 3 safety review of the initial 2,000 participants, therefore the observation period at the 
study site was reduced to at least 15 minutes for the remaining participants in the study. No 
anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed immediately after vaccination (at the 
cut-off). Anxiety related reactions to vaccination, including vasovagal reactions such as syncope and 
presyncope, were rare (<0.1%) and evenly distributed amongst the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups. 
Immediate unsolicited reactions occurring within 30 minutes of vaccination were infrequent and 
occurred in 0.2% of participants in both the vaccine and placebo groups. There were 0.3% of 
participants with solicited reactions in in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.3%) compared to participants in 
the placebo group (0.1%). None of the immediate events reported in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo 
groups were considered serious. These findings are consistent with the safety data of the Ad26-vector 
platform.

All 3 deaths reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group were assessed by the investigator as not related: fatal 
SAE of lung abscess co-reported with AEs of chest pain, cough, and vomiting in 42 years of age male 
with a TTO of 32 days, case maybe confounded by underlying condition; negative COVID-19 test 
result), fatal SAE of pneumonia (reported in 61 years of age female with a TTO of 11 days, negative 
COVID-19 test result; without any other explanatory factors, the relation of the death to the vaccine 
cannot be excluded), and 1 death of unknown cause at the time of data cut-off (in 66 years of age 
female with a TTO of 44 days, insufficient information to perform a causality assessment, but in the 
absence of reactogenicity symptoms and long time to onset, the event is considered not related by the 
applicant).  
Serious adverse events 
Overall, 90 [0.4%] subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 137 [0.6%] subjects in the placebo group 
reported 1 or more SAEs. However, a total of 83 (0.4%) subjects reported SAEs not associated with 
COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 96 (0.4%) subjects in the placebo group. SAEs 
associated with COVID-19 were reported in the infections and infestations and in the investigations 
(SARS-CoV_2 test positive) SOCs (system organ class). 
A total of 8 (<0.1%) participants reported SAEs associated with COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
compared to 44 (0.2%) participants in the placebo group. Among the SAEs not associated with COVID-
19, overall, no major imbalances were observed by SOC. The most frequently reported SAEs by SOC in 
the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups were infections and infestations (0.1% [23 participants] in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.1% [27 participants] in the placebo group) and nervous system disorders 
(< 0.1% [10 participants] in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.1% [8 participants] in the placebo group). 
Treatment related SAEs 
Nine participants reported a total of 10 SAEs (7 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3 in the placebo group) 
which were considered to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator. The 7 related SAE 
reported by 7 subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group were Grade 4 Guillain-Barré syndrome, Grade 3 
radiculitis brachial, Grade 3 post-vaccination syndrome (asthenia), two Grade 2 facial paralysis (Bell’s 
Palsy), Grade 4 pericarditis and Grade 3 hypersensitivity (angioedema).

Medical attended adverse events 
MAAEs were reported for all participants from the moment of vaccination until 6 months after the 
vaccination, except for MAAEs leading to study discontinuation, which were to be reported during the 
entire study. 
Up to the cut-off date , 304 (1.4%) participants reported one or more MAAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group compared to 408 (1.9%) participants in the placebo group. Overall, no major imbalances were 
observed by SOC. The most frequently reported MAAEs by SOC in the COVID-19 vaccine and placebo 
groups were infections and infestations.

supportive clinical studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001 and COV3009. As most of the data is still 
blinded, the data reported is aggregated and not divided between the vaccine and placebo groups. The 
studies include >10,500 participants ≥18 years of age who received either placebo or active vaccine at 
doses up to 1x1011 vp. In the supportive studies, up to the cut-off date of 11 January 2021 (COV1001, 
COV1002, and COV2001) and 14 January 2021 (COV3009), 1 non-related death was reported, and few 
SAEs were observed. Early discontinuations of vaccination or study due to (S)AEs were infrequent in all 
groups. A total of 26 participants reported 1 or more SAEs. Of these, 2 SAEs were considered to be 
related to the study vaccine. In COV1001, a Grade 3 SAE pyrexia was reported post dose 1 of the 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (1×1011 vp) and led to discontinuation of further vaccination. A multiple sclerosis 
event was reported during follow-up post-dose 1 in study COV1001 for a participant who received 
placebo that led to discontinuation of further vaccination. This SAE was considered related to the 
intervention by the investigator but was considered chronic and preceding vaccination by an expert 
neurologist. In addition, 7 SAEs considered unrelated and 18 nonserious AEs consisting primarily of 
COVID-19 infections led to discontinuation of the vaccine or study. 
2.6.5.  Adverse Events of Interest 
In COV3001, as, per protocol, there were no pre-specified AESIs for Ad26.COV2.S clinical 
development, the applicant followed a dynamic medical review of incoming AEs to identify potential 
safety issues. Up to the cut-off date , in the FAS, 140 (0.6%) participants reported at least one 
treatment emergent AESI in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 134 (0.6%) participants in the 
placebo group. Few reported AESIs were assessed as related: 0.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
compared to 0.1% participants in the placebo group. For the majority of the reported AESIs, because 
of lack of plausible biological mechanism, too long time to onset, alternative explications (such as 
underlying pathologies) and confounding factors, causality could not be clearly established. 
Allergic reactions 
In study COV3001, the most frequently reported AEs in the broad SMQ ‘non-anaphylactic allergic 
reactions’ (≥6 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group) were rash (24 participants active vaccine 
including 10 assessed as relate, 16 placebo including 6 related), urticaria (8 participants active vaccine 
including 3 related, 3 placebo – none related), and hypersensitivity (6 participants active vaccine 
including 1 related, 4 placebo – none related). 
Hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria and anaphylaxis have been identified as ADRs in the SmPC. 
Anaphylaxis has been included as an important identified risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP.

Immune-mediated neurological disorders 
There was 1 subject with Guillain-Barré syndrome in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible temporal relationship, 1 non-related SAE of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome in placebo group). The risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome is included in the list of AESIs taken 
in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
There were 3 cases of Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as 
possibly related SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the sponsor; and 1 non-related AE) 
compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non-related). Relatedness to the vaccine cannot be 
excluded and 2 events of facial paralysis are considered at least possibly related to vaccination. Based 
on data from reported events, a causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell’s palsy 
could not be confirmed nor ruled out. Bell’s palsy is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration 
for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
Other Nervous system disorders 
A numerical imbalance observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group for: 
- Tinnitus: Six cases of tinnitus were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group and none in the placebo 
group. For these events, a causal relationship with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine cannot be 
determined. The assessment of causality was confounded by the presence of underlying medical 
conditions that could have contributed to these events. 
- Convulsions/seizures: Four cases were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group (1 serious) and one case 
(non-serious) in the placebo group, all of which were considered not related to the study vaccine by 
the investigator. The risk of generalised convulsion is included in the list of AESIs taken in 
consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
Injection site bruising 
There were 22 subjects with haemorrhagic disorders in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 25 in the 
placebo group. An appropriate warning has been specified in SmPC section 4.4 (i.e. caution in 
individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder 
(such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular 
administration in these individuals). 
Thromboembolic disorders 
A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thromboembolic events with 11 subjects in the 
vaccine group vs. 4 in the placebo group. In the vaccine group, there were: 6 DVT type events, 4 
pulmonary embolism, 1 transverse sinus thrombosis (including 6 SAEs & 1 non-serious related AE; 8 
events occurred within 28 days following vaccination). In the placebo group, there were: 2 DVT events, 
1 pulmonary embolism, 1 thrombosed haemorrhoid (including 1 related SAE & 1 none-related SAE, all 
within 28 days of vaccination). The majority of the participants had underlying medical conditions 
(such as obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes) that could have contributed to the thrombotic and 
thromboembolic events. Only 1 SAE of DVT was reported with Ad26 vaccine (in adult FAS after 28 days 
after vaccination) in AdVac report V5. Venous thromboembolism has been included as an important 
potential risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP. 
Respiratory disorders 
AE of asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the 
placebo group. For the majority of the participants (including the participant in the placebo group), the 
assessment of “not related” was made considering the nature of the condition and the subject’s 
medical history (including longstanding history of asthma). 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 160/218 
 
 
 
In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the COVID-19 
group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 
Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the 
placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory distress, 
Respiratory failure). 
Although the causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance, the risk of exacerbation of chronic 
pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monitored in the planned PASS if 
feasibility is confirmed. 
Increased HIV acquisition risk 
The risk for increased HIV acquisition after vaccination with Ad26-based vaccines is considered to be 
theoretical. In the AdVac Safety Database V5.0, there were 3 cases of incident HIV infection in Ad26-
vaccinated individuals in HIV-V-A004, all captured as SAEs from the same site, which is situated in a 
high endemic region for HIV infection (all cases presenting risk factors for HIV infection) (compared to 
none in the placebo group). To date, there were no incident HIV infections reported in clinical studies 
with Ad26.COV2.S. The applicant has been recommended to submit the next version of the Adenoviral 
Vaccine Safety Database (V6.0) including a discussion of the potential increased risk of HIV acquisition 
in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus-based vaccines with a review of reported cases in the 
updated Ad26 platform data (expected for approximatively April 2021) (see list of recommendations). 
2.6.6.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were only conducted in COV1001, COV1002 (blinded), and COV2001 
(blinded). Overall, a low number of laboratory abnormalities were reported as an AE after vaccination 
with Ad26.COV2.S. 
In study COV1001 Cohort 1a, laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs (Grade 1 or 2 in severity), 
in the active vaccine groups but no risk minimisation procedures were considered needed. Examination 
of safety laboratory assessments at the different timepoints for all vaccination groups showed no 
notable differences compared with baseline values and/or with values from the placebo group. Overall, 
the percentages of participants with abnormal safety laboratory values (biochemistry, haematology, 
coagulation, and urinalysis) were very low and no differences were noted between vaccine and placebo 
groups, vaccine dose levels, and first versus second dose. In study COV1002 at the time of the interim 
analysis, one laboratory-related AE was reported in a participant in the placebo group with Grade 1 C-
reactive protein increased 15 days after the first vaccination. The AE was considered not serious and 
not related to vaccination. The event resolved by the next measurement which occurred 18 days later. 
In study COV2001, no laboratory-related AEs were reported post-dose 1. Individual laboratory data at 
the different timepoints were not available at the time of this analysis. 
Vital signs measurements included body temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood 
pressure. Overall, a low number of vital sign-related AEs were observed after vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S. 
In study COV1001 the following vital signs-related AEs were reported: one Grade 3 AE of hypotensive 
crisis after vaccination which was considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator and one 
serious Grade 3 AE of decreased blood pressure, one Grade 2 AE of bradycardia, one Grade 2 and one 
Grade 1 AE of syncope and one Grade 1 AE of hypertension, all of them after vaccination and which 
were considered unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator. The event of hypotensive crisis 
occurred immediately after vaccination and coincided with an anxiety reaction and the applicant is, 
therefore, of the opinion that the event of hypotensive crisis was anxiety related. As anxiety-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 161/218 
 
 
 
reactions post vaccination are listed in the warnings and precautions section of the SmPC and based on 
the described vital signs-related AEs, no additional risk minimisation procedures are considered 
needed. 
While looking at the Emerging worst vital signs abnormalities in COV1001, frequencies of subjects with 
abnormalities (bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, and tachycardia) were comparable in the 
different groups (active vaccine groups or placebo group). Only the respiratory rate seems increased 
post-dose 1 in the 5×1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S / 5×1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S group (19.5%) compared to 
PL/PL group (11.7%). This difference is not seen post-dose 2. 
In study COV1002 at the time of the interim safety analysis for Cohort 1 one vital signs-related AE of 
presyncope was reported in a participant who received Ad26.COV2.S at 5x1010 vp. 
In COV2001, a total of 4 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S (2 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp 
[0.7%] and 2 in the 1x1011 vp [2.7%] group) were reported with hypertension. Overall, 3 participants 
(all reported in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp [1.1%] group) were reported with pyrexia and 2 
participants (1 participant in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp [0.4%] and 1 in the 1x1011 vp [1.4%] group) 
were reported with syncope. Other AEs (PTs) occurred in at most 1 participant in the combined 
Ad26.COV2.S groups. No vital signs-related AEs were reported in the placebo group. No Grade 3 vital 
signs-related AEs were reported.  
In study COV3001, up to 28 days post vaccination, 14 (0.4%), 7 (0.2%) and 4 (0.1%) of the 
participants (safety subset) in the Ad26.COV2.S group were reported with pyrexia, hypertension and 
syncope, respectively, versus 5 (0.1%), 2 (0.1%) and 5 (0.1%) participants, respectively in the 
placebo group. Other AEs (PTs) were reported in at most 1 participant in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
and/or the placebo group. No Grade 3 vital sign-related AEs were observed after vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S. Two Grade 3 hypertension AEs were reported after vaccination with placebo which were 
considered unrelated to the study vaccine. 
In COV3009, overall, blinded data (FAS; AEs up to 28 days after the first vaccination) were in line with 
the observations in COV3001 with the most frequently reported vital signs-related AEs being pyrexia 
(25 [0.3%] participants overall) and syncope (3 [<0.1%] participants overall). Other AEs (PTs) were 
reported in at most 2 participants overall. 
2.6.7.  Safety in special populations 
The safety parameters were reviewed by subgroup for age at randomisation, comorbidity at baseline, 
by Region, by gender, baseline serostatus and HIV infection. Overall, the safety profile of Ad26 5x1010 
was generally similar independently of the subgroups, in particular the frequencies of subjects with 
SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs (rare). In the Ad26 5x1010 group, for all subgroups, most solicited AEs were 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, and most solicited AEs were transient in nature and reported as 
resolved. The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the same pattern as 
for the pooled population. 
2.6.7.1.  Age groups 
Main clinical study: VAC31518COV3001 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were consistent between these age subgroups. 
However, not surprisingly, in the Ad26 5x1010 group (safety subset), there were less comorbidities at 
baseline in the younger group (31% for subjects 18 to 64 years of age), compared to the older group 
(45% for subjects ≥65 years of age). 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 162/218 
 
 
 
In the Ad26 5x1010 group the frequency of subjects with solicited local AEs clearly decreases with age 
55.7%  for  subjects  aged  ≥18  to  64  vs.  31.8%  for  subjects  aged  ≥65  years.  This  lower  frequency  in 
participants aged ≥65 years was reported for all selected solicited local AEs, including the most frequent 
solicited local AE, ie, vaccination site pain: 54.3% in subjects aged ≥18 to 64 (86% grade 1, 13.4% grade 
2, 0.6% grade 3) vs. 29.6% in subjects aged ≥65 years (94.3% grade 1, 4.4% grade 2, 1.3% grade 3). 
The frequency of subjects with solicited systemic AEs also clearly decreases with age: 59.6% for subjects 
aged ≥18 to 64 vs. 40.2% for subjects aged ≥65 years. A higher frequency was reported for all selected 
solicited  systemic  AEs  (fatigue,  headache,  myalgia,  nausea,  and  pyrexia)  in  younger  subjects.  In 
particular, there were 11% subjects aged ≥18 to 64 years with pyrexia compared to 2.4% subjects aged 
≥65 years.  
In the Ad26 5x1010 group, for all the 2 age subgroups, most solicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity. There were slightly more grade 1 solicited local and systemics AEs in subjects aged ≥65 years 
compared to subjects aged ≥18 to 64, and less grade 2 solicited local and systemics AEs.

2.6.7.2.  Co-morbidities 
In the safety subset of main trial COV3001, the frequencies of subjects with local and systemic 
solicited AEs decrease for subjects with baseline comorbidities compared to subjects without baseline 
comorbidities in the Ad26.COV2.S group only (differences not observed in the placebo group): 
- The frequency of solicited local AEs was lower in participants with one or more comorbidities (42.9%) 
compared to participants without comorbidities at baseline (54%). 
- Solicited systemic AEs were reported less frequently in participants with one or more comorbidities 
(49.6%) compared to participants without comorbidities at baseline (58.1%). 
Subjects 18-64 years of age with comorbidities at baseline shows less local solicited AEs than the 
subjects 18-64 years of age without comorbidities, and less systemic solicited AEs than the subjects 
18-64 years of age without comorbidities. Subjects from 65 years of age with comorbidities at baseline 
shows similar reactogenicity than the subjects from 65 years of age without comorbidities. 
No specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far.  
2.6.7.3.  Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Up to the cut-off date of 31 December 2020, 8 pregnancies were reported in the GMS database for 
study COV3001: 4 in COVID-19 vaccine group and 4 in placebo group. In the COVID-19 group, 2 
pregnancies were still ongoing, and there were 1 spontaneous abortion and 1 ectopic pregnancy (both 
assessed as not related to vaccine). In the placebo group, 1 pregnancy was still ongoing, and there 
were 1 incomplete abortion and 2 elective abortions. Although, up to the cut-off date of 31 December 
2020, 285 breastfeeding women (128 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 157 in placebo group) were enrolled, 
no further information regarding breastfeeding was requested during the study. 
Use during pregnancy and in breastfeeding women are considered as missing information in the RMP.  
2.6.7.4.  By Region 
In the safety subset of the main trial COV3001, the frequencies of subjects with local and systemic 
solicited AEs were slightly higher in Northern America compared to Latin America and Southern Africa 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group only (differences not observed in the placebo group).  
2.6.7.5.  By gender 
In the Ad26 5x1010 group (FAS) regarding the main trial COV3001, there were 12,071 males (55.1%) 
and 9,820 females (44.9%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 164/218 
 
 
 
In the safety subset, the frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were higher in 
females compared to males in the Ad26.COV2.S group only (differences not observed in the placebo 
group): 
- In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequency of local solicited AEs was higher in female (54.5%) 
compared to males (46.2%).  
- In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequency of systemic solicited AEs was also higher in female 
(59.9%) compared to males (50.7%)  
No major differences are observed for the grade 3 local solicited events (1% in females vs. 0.4% in 
males). 
2.6.7.6.  By baseline Serostatus 
In the Ad26 5x1010 group (FAS) regarding main trial COV3001, there were 2,151 subjects (9.8%) 
seropositive at baseline and 19,744 subjects (90.2%) seronegative at baseline (respectively, 2,066 
subjects (9.4%) and 19,822 subjects (90.6%) in placebo group). Overall, the safety profile of Ad26 
5x1010 was generally similar in adults seropositive and seronegative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2. The 
nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the same pattern as for the pooled 
population, without any clinically meaningful differences in frequencies. However, the number of 
vaccinated subjects who were seropositive at baseline is too limited in the safety subset to draw any 
definitive conclusions.   
No specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far.  
2.6.7.7.  By HIV infection 
In the main trial: COV3001, there were 601 subjects (2.7%) HIV infected at baseline and 8,335 
subjects (38.1%) not HIV infected at baseline vaccinated with Ade26.COV2.S. No safety concern was 
observed in adults with stable/well-controlled HIV infection who received the COVID-19 Vaccine 
Janssen 
Nevertheless, the number of vaccinated subjects HIV infected at baseline is too limited in the safety 
subset to draw any conclusions regarding reactogenicity (34 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 25 in placebo 
group). Use in immunocompromised patients is identified as a missing information in the RMP. 
2.6.7.8.  By dose level 
Supportive Clinical Studies (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001) 
Safety data from Ad26.COV2.S administered at different dose levels are available from COV1001 
(5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp) and COV2001 (1.25x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, and 1x1011 vp) in 
adults ≥18 to ≤55 years and ≥65 years of age and from COV1002 (5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp) in adults 
≥20 to ≤55 years of age. Safety data up to 28 days post dose 1 for each study are described below. 
For COV1001 and COV2001, data post dose 1 were pooled within each cohort by dose level within each 
study. 
Overall, no safety concerns were identified after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at dose levels up to 
1x1011 vp. The available safety data are supportive of the dose selection for the Phase 3 studies.

2.6.8.  Immunological events 
Refer to AESIs for an overview of immunological events. 
2.6.9.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interaction with another vaccine was not studied. Interaction with other vaccines is identified as a 
missing information in the RMP. 
Antipyretics/analgesics were recommended post-vaccination for symptom relief as needed. In FAS, a 
similar frequency of subjects used corticosteroids in both group (2.8% in Ad26.COV2.S vs. 2.7% in 
placebo). 
In the safety subset, a higher percentage of participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group than the placebo 
group used antipyretics/analgesics in this period (19.9% and 5.7% of participants, respectively).  
The frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were clearly lower in subjects who did 
not used antipyretics / analgesics (A/A) post-vaccination compared to those who used A/A in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (and also for the grade 3 solicited AEs): 
The frequencies of subjects with solicited AEs were slightly lower in subjects who did not used 
corticosteroids compared to those who used corticosteroids in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
2.6.10.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study COV3001: For all participants, all SAEs, AEs and MAAEs leading to study discontinuation were 
to be reported until completion of the participants last study-related procedure. No AEs or MAAEs 
resulting in study discontinuation were reported. 
Up to the cut-off date of 11 January 2021 (COV1001, COV1002, and COV2001) and 14 January 2021 
(COV3009): In COV1001, 3 unsolicited AEs resulted in study vaccine discontinuation: 1 Grade 3 SAE of 
pyrexia reported post-dose 1 in the 1×1011 vp active vaccine (considered related to the study vaccine 
by the investigator), 1 Grade 1 AE of COVID-19 reported post-dose 1 in the 1×1011 vp, (considered not 
related to study vaccine); 1 Grade 2 SAE of multiple sclerosis reported in post-dose 1 follow-up in the 
placebo group). One SAE of nephrolithiasis (Grade 4) was reported during post-dose 1 follow-up for a 
participant who received active vaccine at the 5x1010 vp dose level which led to discontinuation of 
further vaccination (considered unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator – acknowledged: 
past medical history of kidney stones etc…). In COV1002, there were 3 discontinuations due to SAEs (2 
blood pressure increased, 1 dizziness postural – all not related) with blinded vaccine. In COV2001, 
there were 3 discontinuations due to SAEs (not related lung adenocarcinoma and related parasthesia) 
with blinded vaccine. In COV3009, there were 3 discontinuations due to SAEs (couch, delirium and 
pleuritic pain – all not related) with blinded vaccine.

2.6.12.  Supportive clinical safety data of vaccine using the Ad26 Vector 
As of 04 September 2020, different Ad26 platform-based vaccines developed by Janssen have been 
administered to 114,174 participants. Safety data are available from six reports: AdVac safety 
database report V5.0 (4,874 participants enrolled as of the data cut-off date of 20 December 2019), 
additional reviews of individual case safety reports of SAEs and pregnancy exposures (up to 31 October 
2020; cases which were not part of the current AdVac report), complete cumulative reviews of SAEs 
and pregnancy cases (up to the cut-off of 21 December 2020), and complete cumulative review of 
neuroinflammatory AEs (up to the cut-off of 21 January 2021). 
Data from the AdVac safety database report V5.0 supported the accelerated development of the 
vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S for the prevention of COVID-19, including the dose levels used in the 
FIH. 
Most of the data are from the Ebola programme. Significant amount of data is also available from the 
RSV and HIV programme. Data for other inserts are very limited. The majority of enrolled individuals 
were healthy, Black or African American, or White. Imbalance between groups observed in the AdVac 
safety database V5 (in particular, for region and ethnicity) should be explained and the impact on the 
results should be discussed (see list of recommendations). 
Baseline seropositivity to Ad26 was evaluated in the three large Janssen Vaccines’ clinical vaccine 
programs (Ebola, HIV, and RSV) across various geographic locations and in varying study populations 
(n=3851). Ad26 seroprevalence varied by continent, with the highest seroprevalence reported in Africa 
(77.9% [95% CI 75.9;79.7],n=1,872), followed by Asia (41.4% [28.9;55], exclusively in Thailand, 
n=58), and comparatively low seroprevalence levels in North America (15.1% [13.5;16.9], exclusively 
USA, n=1,748), and Europe (11.6% [7.4;17.5], n=173). To assess the influence of natural pre-
existing immunity to Ad26 on humoral responses, a cross-study analysis was performed by assessing 
insert-specific Ab specifically post 1 Ad26-based vaccination. Based on the limited data, it is considered 
that an impact of pre-existing anti-Ad26 vector immunity on insert specific vaccine-elicited immune 
responses cannot be excluded. The applicant has also presented the first data obtained in the COVID-
19 program to further document this potential impact of immunity to Ad26. However, the data 
gathered so far do not allow the assessment of the impact of natural pre-existing anti-Ad26 vector 
immunity since only 2 subjects had Ad26 nAb at baseline. Of importance, the data of COVID-19 
program so far do not indicate an apparent negative impact of anti-Ad26 vector immunity induced by 
the first vaccine dose on the insert specific vaccine-elicited humoral immune responses post-dose 2. 
The impact on T cell responses was not presented. The potential impact of natural or vaccine induced 
pre-existing anti-Ad26 immunity on vaccine efficacy remains unclear and should be further 
documented. Further data are expected with the COVID-19 program and would help to better 
characterise the impact of natural and vaccine-induced Ad26 immunity on the antigen specific vaccine-
induced immune responses, and its possible impact on vaccine efficacy (see list of recommendations). 
In healthy younger adults (18-60-year-old), overall, Ad26-based vaccines were well tolerated, 
irrespective of the insert, the dose level and the dose number; however, safety data have been 
provided irrespective of dose levels and per subject (cumulating AE after all doses). In next Advac 
reports, the applicant is recommended to provide the solicited AE separately for dose level 5x1010 
(relevant for the COVID-19 vaccination) and other dose levels, and, separately, after dose 1 and after 
dose 2 (compared to placebo) (see list of recommendations). 
Several factors could influence reactogenicity (age, region, pre-existing immunity to Ad26, antigen 
insert, and dose level). In particular, it has been observed that: 
The frequencies (per subject) of local solicited AEs following Ad26 was slightly higher in the younger 
age category (64.0% of adults aged 18-30 years) compared to the 31-50 years and ≥50 years (56.5% 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 167/218 
 
 
 
and 57.2% respectively). The frequencies of systemic solicited AEs following Ad26 was also higher in 
the younger age category (73.5% of adults aged 18-30 years) compared to the 31-50 years and ≥50 
years (62.9% and 62.3% respectively). 
The frequency of solicited AE local and systemic is generally much lower in West Africa than in other 
regions (East and Southern Africa, North America, Europe, and Asia), both for the active and placebo 
groups. Discrepancies across regions could also reflect differences in terms of pre-existing immunity to 
Ad26 (higher in Africa) and methodological differences between studies. This should be discussed in 
the next Advac report (see list of recommendations). 
Overall, the frequency of solicited local (most notably injection site pain) and systemic AEs (mostly 
headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills) tended to be lower in individuals with pre-existing Ad26 
neutralising antibody titres (Ad26 VNA positivity at baseline) compared to individuals without pre-
existing Ad26 neutralising antibody titres at baseline. This was observed for Zabdeno (EPAR) and 
confirmed by the cross-study analysis summarised in the report ‘Influence of Natural Pre-existing 
Immunity to Ad26 on Humoral Immune Responses post 1 Ad26-based Vaccination’ (Ebola and HIV 
programmes). The cross-study analysis indicated that the association remained when stratifying by 
continent. This observation is unlikely to impact the use of the vaccine. The independent effect of pre-
existing immunity to the vector on reactogenicity remains not fully clear. 
For the inserts that have been tested in more than 100 subjects, high differences of frequency of 
solicited local and systemic AE (all grade and severe – related to vaccine or not) have been reported 
depending on the insert. These differences are difficult to interpret given the confounding effect of 
study location (Africa vs other regions), age distribution, and dose level used. Hence, the independent 
effect of the insert on reactogenicity remains unclear. This should be discussed in a next Advac report, 
based on more detailed stratified analyses (see list of recommendations). 
It is difficult to establish an effect of dose level, as relatively few individuals received Ad26 doses of 
1×109 vp, 1×1010 vp, and 9×1010 vp. When only groups with more than 100 individuals were 
considered (0.8×1010 vp, 2×1010 vp, 5×1010 vp, and 1×1011 vp dose levels), there was a trend 
towards an increase in the frequency of some local solicited AEs (all grade and severe, in particular 
injection site pain), and solicited systemic AEs (all grade and severe, and considered related to study 
vaccine, in particular arthralgia, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and nausea), following the increase 
in Ad26 dose. There was no clear trend in the frequency of unsolicited AEs with increasing the Ad26 
dose. 
An increased risk of HIV acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus-based vaccines is 
considered as an important potential risk. This safety concern has been raised with an Ad5-vectored 
HIV vaccine. An increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition was observed in subjects vaccinated with an 
experimental Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine compared to control subjects (Buchbinder et al., 2020). It was 
hypothesised that activated Ad5-specific CD4 T cells could increase rates of HIV-1 acquisition. Although 
the association between risk of HIV-1 acquisition and Ad5-based (or other Ad-based) vaccines is 
controversial and the mechanism for increased risk is unclear, this potential risk should be taken into 
account in studies with this viral vector platform. The overall assessment of the risk for increased HIV 
acquisition after vaccination with Ad26-based vaccines is considered to be theoretical. In the AdVac 
Safety Database V5.0, there were 3 cases of incident HIV infection in Ad26-vaccinated individuals in 
HIV-V-A004, all captured as SAEs from the same site, which is situated in a high endemic region for 
HIV infection (all cases presenting risk factors for HIV infection) (compared to none in the placebo 
group). In study VAC52150EBL2002 (Ebola vaccine), one adult male participant tested HIV 
seropositive approximately 1 year after receipt of one dose of Ad26.ZEBOV (sexually inactive at study 
enrolment; no further information available about risk factors for HIV infection). There have been no 
HIV infections reported in the development programs of RSV, Filovirus, and malaria Ad26-vectored 
Assessment report

Page 168/218 
 
 
 
vaccines. To date, there were no incident HIV infections reported in clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S. 
The next version of the Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database (V6.0) should be submitted including a 
discussion of the potential increased risk of HIV acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus-
based vaccines with a review of reported cases in the updated Ad26 platform data (expected for 
approximatively April 2021). (see list of recommendations) 
Adults aged ≥60 years have been included in a Phase 1 and a Phase 2a study of the RSV vaccine 
clinical development program. In total, 228 individuals aged ≥60 years received an Ad26.RSV.preF 
based regimen in these studies. Overall, no safety concerns have been raised to date in this 
population. However, data are very limited, and only brief conclusions have been given for adults ≥60 
years. In next Advac reports, the applicant should provide more detailed data by age group (less than 
65, between 65-74, 75-84 and 85 and above) and to discuss them (see list of recommendations). 
In the Ad26 platform safety data, 1,631 pregnancy cases were reported (majority reported in Ebola 
vaccine trials in DRC and Rwanda) and 939 final pregnancy outcomes were reported: healthy baby for 
781, various other outcomes for 158 pregnancies (including 102 spontaneous abortions), ongoing for 
243, and unknown/not reported for 449. Of these 1,631 pregnancies, caesarean section delivery was 
reported as delivery method in 193 pregnancies and 61 reported normal delivery. Overall, pregnancy 
outcomes are consistent with what could be expected in sub-Saharan Africa.  
For most pregnancies, vaccine exposure took place within 3 months preceding conception (N=464). 
The number of pregnancy cases is similar for exposure during the first (N=280), second (N=242) or 
third trimester (N=267) of pregnancy. For 378 cases, time of vaccine exposure was not reported. The 
number of pregnancies exposed in the first trimester (280) is lower than the threshold of at least 300 
pregnancies exposed to reach a conclusion on the effect on malformation ("Guideline on risk 
assessment of medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling" 
EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). 
Moreover, although, overall, the cumulative review of pregnancies is promising, a comparison with the 
frequency of outcomes in pregnancies that were not exposed to Zabdeno is missing to interpret the 
data adequately. 
The majority of the reported solicited AE were of low or mild intensity and lasted for few days after 
administration of the vaccine. No significant safety issues have been identified to date. 
Overall, the Janssen Ad26-based vaccines have an acceptable safety profile in all populations studied, 
including young adults, children and adolescents, ≥60-year-old, HIV-infected individuals, pregnant 
women and individuals with pre-existing Ad26 neutralising antibodies. The numbers of children and 
adolescents, and individuals ≥60-year-old in the safety database is however limited, as well as the 
number of HIV-infected individuals.  
Safety data of Ad26-based vaccine in (older) adults with comorbidities, which are relevant for the 
COVID-19 vaccine, are lacking. Moreover, it is noted that only about 10% of all subjects in the AdVac 
safety database were European, and about one third were White. 
The absence of safety concern may be considered reassuring in terms of the safety of the 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and other future Ad26 based vaccines. However, safety and reactogenicity may 
be driven by both the platform and the insert. It is noted that differences in the frequency of solicited 
AEs were reported across inserts, although the independent effect of the insert on reactogenicity and 
safety is currently unclear (given the confounding effect of factors such as dose level used, age, 
region, and pre-existing immunity to the vector). Overall, it remains unclear to which extend the safety 
profile of Ad26 vaccines can be extrapolated from one insert to another.

2.6.13.  Discussion on clinical safety 
2.6.13.1.  Exposure  
The clinical safety database consists of 54,586 adults ≥18 years who received at least one dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S or placebo regardless of the dose level or schedule in studies COV3001, COV3009, 
COV2001, COV1002 and COV1001 up cut-off date (22 January 2021 for COV3001 and 11 January 
2021 for the others). 
Ad26-based vaccine platform clinical safety data, and clinical safety data from studies COV1001 (Phase 
1/2a), COV1002 (phase 1 in Japan), COV2001 (phase 2a) (cut-off date for these 3 studies: 
11/01/2021) and the phase III trial COV3009 (cut-off date: 14/01/2021, blinded) are supportive. 
The assessment of Ad26.COV2.S safety is mainly based on the interim analysis of the results from 
Phase 3 study COV3001 (cut-off 22/01/2021), comprising 43,783 participants ≥18 years of age who 
received either a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo 
(21,888 adults) (Full Analysis Set – FAS). Reactogenicity (solicited local and systemic events) and 
unsolicited adverse events were collected in a subset of 6,736 participants who received either vaccine 
(3,356 adults) or placebo (3,380 adults) (Safety subset). 
At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow-up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. 
Longer safety follow-up of >2 months is available for 23,903 participants in the FAS: 11,948 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (54.6%) and 11,955 in the placebo group (54.6%). However, 
only 34 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.2%) and 31 in the placebo group (0.1%) have been 
followed for close to 4 months. Long-term safety is identified as a missing information in the RMP 
(uncertainties). 
In the FAS and the safety subset, the demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among 
participants who received Ad26.COV2.S or placebo (age, gender, Region, ethnicity, BMI, serostatus at 
baseline, presence of comorbidities at baseline…). 
In the FAS, with a median age of 52 years of age, there were 21,895 adults ≥18 years of age, 
including 17,636 adults 18-64 yoa (80.5%) and 4,259 adults ≥65 yoa (19.5%) (with 809 adults ≥75 
yoa - 3.7%), including 8,936 adults with comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progression 
to severe COVID-19 (40.8%) (with 2,271 adults ≥65 yoa with comorbidities – 10.4%), and including 
2,151 adults seropositive at baseline (9.8%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 
5x1010 vp. Most common comorbidities were obesity (28.5%), hypertension (10.3%), type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (7.3%), serious heart conditions (2.3%), and asthma (1.3%). Other comorbidities were 
present in ≤1% of the participants. 
In the safety subset, with a median age of 54, there were 3,356 adults ≥18 years of age, including 
2,593 adults 18-64 yoa (77.3%) and 763 adults ≥65 yoa (22.7%) (with 150 adults ≥75 yoa – 4.5%), 
and including 1,135 adults with comorbidities (33.8%) (with 341 adults ≥65 yoa with comorbidities – 
10.2%), and including 154 adults seropositive at baseline (4.6%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the 
selected dose level of 5x1010 vp. 
The demographic profile of Ad26.COV2.S was generally similar between the safety subset and the FAS, 
with the exception of race, country, and serostatus at baseline. In the FAS, participants were mainly 
from US (44.1%), Brazil (16.6%), South Africa (15%); in addition to Colombia (9.7%), Argentina 
(6.8%), Peru (4%), Chile (2.6%) and Mexico (1.1%). In the safety subset were included only 
participants from the US (51.5%), Brazil (38.5%) and South Africa (10.1%), for practical reason (Cf. 
methodology section). In the safety subset, the proportion of White participants was greater (83.4%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 170/218 
 
 
 
compared to the FAS (58.7%). The proportion of participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at 
baseline was lower (4.6%) compared to the FAS (9.6%). 
Nevertheless, the safety subset represents a population with diversity by age, gender, race, health 
status, comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, which includes those most at risk of severe COVID-
19 and is representative of a real-life setting. 
As a small number of HIV participants were included in COV3001 safety subset. Use in 
immunocompromised patients is identified as a missing information in RMP (please see discussion 
below). 
Interaction with another vaccine was not studied (missing information in the RMP). 
Of note, the demographic and baseline characteristics were also generally well balanced between the 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine groups and the placebo groups in supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002, 
COV2001). All the participants from Study COV1002 came from Japan. 
All the adverse reactions reported in the safety subset of the clinical trial COV3001 have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.13.2.  Adverse events  
Solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs (including deaths), MAAEs and AESIs were evaluated.  
Solicited Adverse Events 
Reactogenicity in pivotal study COV3001 
In the pivotal study COV3001, reactogenicity was assessed in the safety subset. 
During the 7-day post-vaccination period, in Ad26.COV2.S group, all solicited local AEs (vaccination 
site erythema, vaccination site pain, vaccination site swelling) (50.3%) and solicited systemic AEs 
(fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea and pyrexia) (55.2%) were reported more frequently than in 
control group (19.5% and 35.1% respectively).  
Pyrexia (defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C, as recorded by the participants) was reported in 9.0% 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to 0.6% of participants in the placebo group. 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE in Ad26.COV2.S group was vaccination site pain (48.7% 
in Ad26.COV2.S vs. 16.7% in placebo group). The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs 
were headache (39% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue (38.3% vs. 
21.6%, respectively), and myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). 
Solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited AEs was low 
overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2.2%) compared to participants in the 
placebo group (0.7%) (no grade 4). The most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited local AE was 
vaccination site pain reported in 0.3% of participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (vs. 0.1% in placebo 
group), and the most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were fatigue (1% in 
Ad26.COV2.S vs. 0.3% in placebo) and myalgia (1% vs. 0.2% , respectively). 
All solicited local AEs are considered related to study vaccination by definition. Most solicited systemic 
AEs after vaccination were considered to be related to study vaccine: 98.16% (1819/1853) of the 
solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the study vaccine, and 95.2% (1131/1188) to the 
placebo. Regarding the severity, most Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were considered as related to 
Ade26.COV2.s, there was only one report of grade 3 headache that was not considered related to the 
study vaccine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 171/218 
 
 
 
Most solicited AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Overall, the median duration of 
the selected solicited AEs was similar in both groups (1 to 2 days after vaccination), and also the 
median time to onset (within 1 to 3 days after vaccination). 
Reactogenicity in supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) 
Overall, the solicited and unsolicited AEs in the supportive studies were consistent with the pivotal 
phase 3 COV3001 study. 
Safety data of a 2-dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) administered at a 56-day interval was 
available from COV1001 in 77 adults ≥18 to ≤55 years (Cohort 1a) and 81 adults ≥65 years (Cohort 
3) of age. In general, no safety concerns were identified after vaccination with two doses of 
Ad26.COV2.S compare to 1 dose with similar reactogenicity and unsolicited events. By dose, slightly 
higher frequencies of solicited systemic AEs (main difference regarding pyrexia), and unsolicited AEs 
were observed post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2. . Lower frequencies of Grade 3 solicited and 
unsolicited AEs were observed after a second vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S compared to the first dose 
in both age groups (adults aged ≥18 to ≤55 and aged ≥65). 
Unsolicited Adverse events (COV3001) 
As defined in the protocol, for the participants in the safety subset, the investigator was to record 
systematically all unsolicited AEs, whether serious or non-serious from the time of vaccination until 28 
days post-vaccination. Without such a requirement for a systematic collection of all unsolicited events 
for those participants in the FAS who were not in the safety subset (although spontaneous unsolicited 
reports were captured in the eCRF), and although a much larger number of subjects have been 
vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S in FAS (21,895), the frequencies calculated in the safety subset (3,356 
subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S) is preferred (higher than in the FAS). The selection of 
unsolicited AEs to be presented in the ADR table in the SmPC was made applying the following criteria 
(all criteria had to be met): Event occurred with a frequency of at least 0.1% in the safety subset; The 
AE was not collected as a solicited AE (to avoid duplication of the event in both solicited and unsolicited 
sections); The unsolicited AE occurred at a higher frequency (of >0.1%) in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
compared to the placebo group; A medical review was done to establish plausible casual relationship to 
the vaccine and to assess confounding factors. Moreover, it has been checked that the unsolicited AEs 
reported in Ad26.COV2.S FAS (applying the same criteria as for the safety subset) are also present in 
the ADR table. 
In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported during the 28-days post-vaccination 
period was similar for participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (13.1%) compared to participants in the 
placebo group (12%). In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs by PT 
(≥1.0% of participants) were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain, which were also 
recorded as solicited AEs. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the unsolicited ADRs (not recorded as solicited 
AEs) selected for the ADR table in the SmPC are chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, muscular 
weakness and pain in extremity. Most reported unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. 
There was as similar frequency of participants with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both group 
(0.6% in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 0.5% in the placebo group). The frequency of unsolicited AEs 
that were considered related to vaccination was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
(7.2%) compared to participants in the placebo group (4.6%). There were an imbalance between 
vaccine and placebo in related unsolicited AEs (difference ≥ 2 related events in favour of vaccine 
group) observed for cough (12 related with vaccine vs. 4 in placebo), sneezing (10 vs. 8), 
oropharyngeal pain (5 vs. 1), tremor (3 vs. 1), back pain (3 vs. 1) and hyperhidrosis (2 vs. 0). These 
related events have been appropriately added in the ADR table in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 172/218 
 
 
 
Five subjects (0.1%) reported 6 unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 considered to be related to the 
study vaccine in the Ad26.COV2.S group (compared to 1 in placebo group): 1 chill, 1 fatigue, 1 
malaise, 1 diarrhoea, 1 pain in extremity and 1 headache (none of grade 4). 
Of note, no imbalance was observed in the frequency of unsolicited AEs in the Nervous System 
Disorder class between the Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo group in the FAS or the safety subset (all 
AEs or related AEs). 
Immediate unsolicited reactions occurring within 30 minutes of vaccination were infrequent and 
occurred in 0.2% of participants in both the vaccine and placebo groups. There were no reports of 
anaphylaxis immediately following vaccination (at the cut-off). 
2.6.13.3.  Treatment-emergent AESIs (COV3001) 
As, per protocol, there were no pre-specified AESIs for Ad26.COV2.S clinical development, the 
applicant followed a dynamic medical review of incoming AEs to identify potential safety issues for 
conditions including, but not limited to immune mediated and/or (neuro) inflammatory events (e.g., 
hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Bell’s palsy) and thrombotic and 
thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis). Treatment emergent AESIs 
were evaluated in the FAS. Up to the cut-off date, in the FAS, the same frequency of subjects reported 
at least one treatment emergent AESI in both groups (0.6%). Few reported AESIs were assessed as 
related: 0.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 0.1% participants in the placebo group. 
Allergic reactions 
In this study, the most frequently reported AEs in the broad SMQ ‘non-anaphylactic allergic 
reactions’(≥6 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group) were rash (24 participants active vaccine 
including 10 assessed as relate, 16 placebo including 6 related), urticaria (8 participants active vaccine 
including 3 related, 3 placebo – none related), and hypersensitivity (6 participants active vaccine 
including 1 related, 4 placebo – none related). Events of urticaria and rash were considered as likely 
related to the vaccine. Further assessment of the events under the PT ‘hypersensitivity’ showed most 
of these events to be either seasonal allergies or allergy to a medication other than the vaccine. 
In addition, an SAE of type IV hypersensitivity (Grade 3), not classified as anaphylaxis, was reported in 
1 vaccinated individual with rash and erythema from day 2 after vaccination, and urticaria and 
angioedema of the lips without respiratory distress from day 4. This case does not meet the Brighton 
Collaboration criteria for anaphylaxis. The event was assessed as Type IV hypersensitivity and was 
considered likely related to the vaccine due to the close temporal association. 
Moreover, since the data lock, the applicant received a SUSAR report of pyrexia, swollen tongue, and 
dyspnoea from study VAC31518COV3012 (ongoing study in South Africa). The participant received 
Ad26.COV2.S in an open label fashion. This case with 1 major respiratory criterion (tongue swelling) 
and 2 minor criterion (dyspnoea and urticaria) meets the Brighton Collaboration case definition criteria 
for anaphylaxis with level 2 of diagnostic certainty. 
Of note, another SUSAR of anaphylaxis was received from the same study, but the event is confounded 
in underlying COVID-19 infection (the symptoms included headache, fever, chills and dizziness). This 
case with 1 major cardiovascular criteria of hypotension and no other major or minor criteria does not 
meet the BCCD of anaphylaxis. Additional information has been requested by the applicant for further 
assessment. 
Hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria and anaphylaxis have been identified as ADRs in the SmPC. Finally, 
anaphylaxis is considered as an important identified risk in the RMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 173/218 
 
 
 
Immune-mediated neurological disorders 
There was 1 subject with Guillain-Barré syndrome in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible temporal relationship, 1 non-related SAE of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome in placebo group). The event of Guillain-Barré syndrome is included in the list of AESIs taken 
in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
There were 3 cases of Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as 
possibly related SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the Sponsor; and 1 non-related AE) 
compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non-related). Relatedness to the vaccine cannot be 
excluded and 2 events of facial paralysis are considered at least possibly related to vaccination. 
Participants had underlying medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity) that could also have 
contributed to the event. Overall, based on the reported data f, a causal relationship between 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell’s palsy could not be confirmed nor ruled out. Bell’s palsy is included 
in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
Other Nervous system disorders 
A numerical imbalance observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group for: 
- Tinnitus: Six cases of tinnitus were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group and none in the placebo 
group. All these cases were considered non-serious. Two cases were considered related by the 
investigator. Review of the cases revealed no pattern in terms of temporal association with the vaccine 
(Time to onset range 1 to 22 days). All participants had underlying medical conditions (such as history 
of tinnitus and migraine, history of hypertension, seasonal allergies and hypothyroidism) or used 
medications that offered a more plausible alternative cause for the event than the vaccine. None of 
these events have reported further complications such as hearing loss. In addition, there was only one 
case of tinnitus in the safety database from the AdVac platform (RSV program). 
- Convulsions/seizures: Four cases were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group (1 serious) and one case 
(non-serious) in the placebo group, all of which were considered not related to the study vaccine by 
the investigator. Majority of the subjects had underlying medical conditions (such as dementia/epilepsy 
and diabetes) were present that could have contributed to the events of convulsions/seizures. The risk 
of generalised convulsion is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and 
additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
Injection site bruising 
There were 22 subjects with haemorrhagic disorders in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 25 in the 
placebo group. There were 13 AESIs of injection site bruising (including contusion, haematoma and 
ecchymosis) with Ad26 5e10 compared to 10 in placebo. An appropriate warning has been specified in 
SmPC section 4.4 (i.e. caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with 
thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may 
occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals). 
Thromboembolic disorders 
A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thromboembolic events with 11 subjects in the 
vaccine group vs. 4 in the placebo group. The majority of the participants had underlying medical 
conditions (such as obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes) that could have contributed to these events. 
In order to assess the impact of vaccination on coagulation, and the risk of inducing a hypercoagulable 
state, it has been requested to include laboratory tests for the assessment of potential vaccine-induced 
antiphospholipid syndrome and vaccine-induced activation of coagulation (lupus anticoagulants, anti-
beta 2 glycoprotein, anti-cardiolipin and D-dimers), pre and post vaccination in further subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 174/218 
 
 
 
enrolled; and to perform assessments of, at least, anti-cardiolipin lgG and lgM, and anti-β2-
Glycoprotein 1 IgA, IgG, IgM in frozen serum material pre- and post-first and second vaccination.  
One SAE of DVT was reported with Ad26 vaccine (in adult FAS after 28 days after vaccination) in 
AdVac report V5.  
Venous thromboembolism has been included as an important potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns of the RMP. 
Respiratory disorders 
AE of asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the 
placebo group. For the majority of the participants (including the participant in the placebo group), the 
assessment of “not related” was made considering the nature of the condition and the subject’s 
medical history (including longstanding history of asthma). 
In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the 
Ade26.COV2.S group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 
6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory 
distress, Respiratory failure). 
Increased HIV acquisition risk 
The risk for increased HIV acquisition after vaccination with Ad26-based vaccines is considered to be 
theoretical. In the AdVac Safety Database V5.0, there were 3 cases of incident HIV infection in Ad26-
vaccinated individuals in HIV-V-A004, all captured as SAEs from the same site, which is situated in a 
high endemic region for HIV infection (all cases presenting risk factors for HIV infection) (compared to 
none in the placebo group). In study VAC52150EBL2002 (Ebola vaccine), one adult male participant 
tested HIV seropositive approximately 1 year after receipt of one dose of Ad26.ZEBOV (sexually 
inactive at study enrolment; no further information available about risk factors for HIV infection). 
There have been no HIV infections reported in the development programs of RSV, Filovirus, and 
malaria Ad26-vectored vaccines. To date, there were no incident HIV infections reported in clinical 
studies with Ad26.COV2.S. The next version of the The applicant is recommended to submit the 
Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database (V6.0) including a discussion of the potential increased risk of HIV 
acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus-based vaccines with a review of reported cases in 
the updated Ad26 platform data (expected for approximatively April 2021) (see list of 
recommendations).  
Conclusion on AESIs 
Besides the numerical imbalances described above, there were no notable patterns or numerical 
imbalances between the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo group for treatment-emergent AESIs (including 
neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and cardiovascular events) that would suggest a causal relationship to 
the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. The overall total number of cases of AEs of interest observed in the study 
were low and within the rates observed in the general population. For the majority of the reported 
AESIs, because of lack of plausible biological mechanism, not plausible time to onset, alternative 
explications (such as underlying pathologies) and confounding factors, a causality could not be clearly 
established. Finally, the absence of a clear causal association is further enforced by the safety data 
from the platform. 
SAEs and deaths 
Pivotal study COV3001 
In study COV3001, SAEs (including deaths) were evaluated in the FAS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 175/218 
 
 
 
Fewer deaths were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group (3, none confirmed to be associated with 
COVID-19) compared to the placebo group (16, including 6 confirmed to be associated with COVID-
19). All 3 deaths reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group were assessed by the investigator as not-related 
to vaccination: fatal SAE of lung abscess , fatal SAE of pneumonia , and 1 death of unknown cause at 
the time of data cut-off . 
Until the cut-off date, in the FAS, 90 (0.4%) subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 137 (0.6%) 
subjects in the placebo group reported 1 or more non-fatal SAEs. However, a total of 83 (0.4%) 
subjects reported SAEs not associated with COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 96 
(0.4%) subjects in the placebo group. SAEs associated with COVID-19 were reported in the infections 
and infestations and in the investigations (preferred term: SARS-CoV_2 test positive) SOCs. 
Among the SAEs not associated with COVID-19, overall, no major imbalances were observed by SOC. 
The most frequently reported SAEs by SOC in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups were infections 
and infestations and nervous system disorders. 
For the nervous system disorders, 10 subjects reported 12 SAEs in the COVID-19 group (compared to 
8 subjects reporting 8 SAEs in the placebo group). Six SAEs are considered related to the 
Ad26.COV2.S (2 Facial paralysis, 1 Cerebral haemorrhage, 1 Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 Radiculitis 
brachial and 1 Transverse sinus thrombosis: please Cf. AESIs discussed before). None were considered 
related in the placebo group. 
For the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, an imbalance was observed with 10 subjects 
reported 10 SAEs in the COVID-19 group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 
subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, Dyspnoea, Cough, 
Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). None were assessed as related to 
vaccine in both groups. 
An imbalance was also observed for the hepatobiliary disorders with 4 subjects reported 4 SAEs in the 
COVID-19 group (2 Cholecystitis acute, 1 Cholecystitis, 1 Cholelithiasis) compared to 1 subject 
reporting 1 SAE in the placebo group (Cholecystitis chronic). None were assessed as related to vaccine 
in both groups. 
There were no (S)AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) 
Safety data on deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to study discontinuation are available from supportive 
clinical studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, and COV3009. The studies include >10,500 participants 
≥18 years of age who received either placebo or active vaccine at doses up to 1x1011 vp (the vast 
majority had only a follow up of 26 days). As of the cut-off date, only 1 death was reported (accidental 
death of a COV3009 participant). Few SAEs and early discontinuations due to AEs were observed in all 
groups. The available data from the supportive studies does not raise any safety concern.  
Medically attended Adverse Events 
Pivotal study COV3001 
In study COV3001 MAAEs were evaluated in the FAS 
Until the cut-off date, in the FAS, 1.4% participants reported one or more MAAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group compared to 1.9% participants in the placebo group. Overall, no major imbalances were 
observed by SOC. The most frequently reported MAAEs by SOC in the COVID-19 vaccine and placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 176/218 
 
 
 
 
groups were infections and infestations (0.5% in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.8% in the placebo 
group). By PT, COVID-19 infection was the most frequently reported MAAE for 16 (0.1%) of 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 35 (0.2%) participants in the placebo group. 
When evaluating the MAAEs not associated with Covid-19, up to the cut-off date, 286 (1.3%) 
participants reported one or more MAAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 361 (1.6%) 
participants in the placebo group (and 0.3% grade 3 in each group). As expected, the majority of 
MAAEs associated with COVID were in the infections and infestation SOC. 
There were 0.1% of related MAAEs (not associated with covid-19) in both groups. Most of these are 
discussed in the SAE and AESI sections. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the MAAEs were mainly in the 
following SOCs: nervous system (2 facial paralysis, 2 headache, 1 Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 
radiculitis brachial, 1 syncope) and general disorders and administration site conditions (2 pyrexia, 1 
chills, 1 influenza like illness, 1 injection site reaction, 1 vaccination site hypersensibility, 1 vaccination 
site swelling). 
2.6.13.4.  Clinical laboratory parameters 
An evaluation of the clinical laboratory parameters was included in COV1001, COV1002a and COV2001 
(haematology, chemistry and urinalysis in COV1001, haematology and chemistry in COV1002a, and 
haematology in COV2001). Overall, a low number of laboratory abnormalities were reported as an AE 
after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. 
2.6.13.5.  Safety by subgroup (COV3001) 
Overall, the safety profile of Ad26 5x1010 was similar independently of the subgroups, in particular the 
frequencies of subjects with SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs (rare). In the Ad26 5x1010 group, for all 
subgroups, most solicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, and most solicited AEs were 
transient in nature and reported as resolved. The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was 
similar, showing the same pattern as for the pooled population. However, the following differences 
were noted: 
By age group: The reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged ≥65 years compared to 
the younger adults aged ≥18 to 64. Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were 
consistent between the different age subgroups. However, as expected, in the Ad26 5x1010 group 
(safety subset), there were less comorbidities at baseline in the younger group (31% for subjects 18 to 
64 years of age), compared to the older group (45% for subjects ≥65 years of age). 
Adults with comorbidities at baseline: The reactogenicity was lower in participants with any 
comorbidity at baseline than in adults without any comorbidity. The difference in reactogenicity profile 
by comorbidities was observed in adults aged 18-64, but no difference was observed in adults aged 
≥65.  
Subjects 18-64 years of age with comorbidities at baseline reported less local solicited AEs than the 
subjects 18-64 years of age without comorbidities, and less systemic solicited AEs than the subjects 
18-64 yoa without comorbidities.  
Subjects from 65 years of age with comorbidities at baseline reported similar reactogenicity than the 
subjects from 65 years of age without comorbidities. 
By Region: Subjects from Northern America reported a higher percentage of reactogenicity than 
subjects from Latin America and Southern Africa. However, differences in the demographic and 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 177/218 
 
 
 
baseline characteristics, as well as cultural differences in AE reporting in clinical practice, could 
interfere with this observation. 
By gender: Females reported a higher percentage of reactogenicity than males (although both 
subgroups had a similar median age). 
By baseline seropositivity: The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the 
same pattern as for the pooled population, without any clinically meaningful differences in frequencies. 
However, the number of vaccinated subjects who were seropositive at baseline is too limited in the 
safety subset to draw any definitive conclusions. 
Seronegative subjects 18-64 years of age reported similar frequency of local solicited AEs than the 
seropositive subjects 18-64 years of age, and slightly more systemic solicited AEs than the seropositive 
subjects 18-64 years of age.  
Seronegative subjects from 65 years of age reported less local solicited AEs than the seropositive 
subjects from 65 years of age, and similar frequency of systemic solicited AEs than the seropositive 
subjects from 65 years of age.  
By HIV infection at baseline: The frequency of local and systemic solicited AEs was slightly lower in HIV 
infected adults at baseline. However, the number of vaccinated subjects HIV infected at baseline is too 
limited in the safety subset to draw any conclusions regarding reactogenicity (34 in Ad26.COV2.S 
group and 25 in placebo group). 
Concomitant therapies 
The frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were clearly lower in subjects who did 
not use antipyretics / analgesics (A/A) post-vaccination compared to those who used A/A in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (and also for the grade 3 solicited AEs). The frequencies of subjects with solicited 
AEs were slightly lower in subjects who did not use corticosteroids compared to those who used 
corticosteroids in the Ad26.COV2.S group. 
Use in pregnancy 
In COV3001, up to the cut-off date of 31 December 2020, 8 pregnancies were reported in the GMS 
database for this study: 4 in COVID-19 vaccine group and 4 in placebo group. In the COVID-19 group, 
2 pregnancies were still ongoing, and there were 1 spontaneous abortion and 1 ectopic pregnancy 
(both assessed as not related to vaccine). In the placebo group, 1 pregnancy was still ongoing, and 
there were 1 incomplete abortion and 2 elective abortions. 
In the Ad26 platform safety data (cut-off 21 December 2020), of the 1,631 unique pregnancies 
(majority reported in Ebola vaccine trials in DRC and Rwanda), 939 final pregnancy outcomes were 
reported: healthy baby for 781, various other outcomes for 158 pregnancies (including 102 
spontaneous abortions), ongoing for 243, and unknown/not reported for 449. Overall, pregnancy 
outcomes are consistent with what could be expected in sub-Saharan Africa.  
The number of pregnancy cases reported is similar for exposure during the first (N=280), second 
(N=242) or third trimester (N=267) of pregnancy. For 378 cases, time of vaccine exposure was not 
reported. The number of pregnancies exposed in the first trimester (280) is lower than the threshold of 
at least 300 pregnancies exposed to reach a conclusion on the effect on malformation ("Guideline on 
risk assessment of medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling" 
EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). 
Although, overall, the cumulative review of pregnancies did not reveal any safety concern related to 
Ad26-based vaccine exposure during pregnancy, a comparison with the frequency of outcomes in 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 178/218 
 
 
 
pregnancies that were not exposed to the Ad26 -vaccine is missing in order to interpret the data 
adequately.  
The applicant has categorised the use of Ad26.COV2 during pregnancy as an area of missing 
information in the RMP. An open-label, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and 
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in healthy pregnant participants (Trial VAC31518COV2004) and a 
COVID-19 Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry (C-VIPER) are planned. 
In COV3001, up to the cut-off date of 31 December 2020, 285 breastfeeding women (128 in 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 157 in placebo group) were enrolled. However no further information 
regarding breastfeeding was requested during the study. Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding is 
considered as missing information in the RMP. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The final clinical study report for study VAC31518COV3001 will be submitted no later than December 
2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA, to confirm the safety profile of 
Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine and provide long term safety data. 
2.6.14.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety evaluation of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is based on the interim analysis of the results from 
Phase 3 study COV3001 (cut-off 22/01/2021), comprising 43,783 participants ≥18 years of age who 
received either a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo 
(21,888 adults) with a median of 2 months of follow-up after vaccination. Reactogenicity was collected 
in a subset of 6,736 participants who received either vaccine (3,356 adults) or placebo (3,380 adults). 
The safety of Ad26.COV2.S is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions occurring during the 
first 7 days after vaccination. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate and transient. The 
reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged ≥65 years compared to the younger adults 
aged ≥18 to 64. There has been observed higher reactogenicity in females than in males and lower 
reactogenicity in subjects with 1 or more baseline comorbidities than those without any comorbidity, 
mainly observed in participants aged 18-64. There was no major difference in the reactogenicity 
between seropositive and seronegative participants at baseline and by race/ethnicities. 
SAEs and AESIs were infrequent in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups. Although no specific risk has 
been identified, a causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, 
Bell’s Palsy and chronic pulmonary disorders exacerbation (i.e. asthma and COPD) could not be 
confirmed nor ruled out. Guillain-Barré Syndrome and Bell’s Palsy are included in the list of AESI and 
taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. The risk of exacerbation 
of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monitored in the planned 
PASS if feasibility is confirmed.  
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory 
disease (VAERD), and Venous thromboembolism are considered as important potential risks. 
Anaphylaxis is considered as an important identified risk. More frequently reported AESIs in the 
vaccine group, rash, urticaria, and hypersensitivity are included as Adverse reactions in the PI. 
Anaphylaxis has also been included in the SmPC section 4.8.  
In conclusion, the observed safety profile is considered as favourable. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: the MAH should submit the final clinical study report for the randomised, 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 179/218 
 
 
 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind study VAC31518COV3001. The study subjects are expected to be 
followed for 24 months after the first dose. (see Annex II of the product information). 
Regarding missing data to confirm safety in subpopulations that were not studied or whose data are 
limited please refer to section 2.7. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns:  
Sunmmary of safety concerns 
Important identified risks 
•  Anaphylaxis 
Important potential risks 
•  Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 
•  Venous thromboembolism 
Missing information 
•  Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding 
•  Use in immunocompromised patients 
•  Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 
•  Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorders) 
•  Interaction with other vaccines 
•  Long-term safety 
Risks considered important for the inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
Anaphylaxis has been added as an important identified risk based on one confirmed case of 
anaphylaxis (Brighton Collaboration Level 2 of diagnostic certainty) reported in the open label study 
VAC31518COV3012. 
Anaphylaxis is known to possibly occur with any injectable vaccine. Ad26.COV2.S contains polysorbate 
80 whose structure presents similarities with PEG, recently suspected to be involved in anaphylactic 
reactions with mRNA vaccines. The potential for polysorbate 80 to trigger hypersensitivity and the 
possibility of cross-reactivity between PEG and PS80 have been discussed in the literature3;4. Cases of 
PS80-induced hypersensitivity have been reported and have involved different drugs, including a 
vaccine, and different routes of administration, including intramuscular 5;6;7. 
Anaphylaxis is also anticipated to be reported in the context of large-scale vaccination, where many 
more individuals will be vaccinated. Moreover, mass vaccination campaigns may involve healthcare

professionals who do not routinely administer vaccines and should therefore be fully aware of the risk 
minimisation measures related to anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is thus considered as an important 
identified risk. 
The analysis of safety data provided in the cMAA identified Venous thromboembolism as an important 
potential risk: inclusion was proposed, based on the numerical imbalance observed in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group vs the placebo group (i.e. 11 vs 4 cases; including 6 vs 2 SAEs) (refer to section 2.6.5 for further 
details). Additional PV activity are planned to further characterise this risk. It is recommended that the 
study will include laboratory testing for evaluating potential vaccine-induced antiphospholipid 
syndrome and vaccine-induced activation of coagulation by measuring lupus anticoagulants, anti-beta 
2 glycoprotein, anti-cardiolipin and D-dimers.  
 ‘Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory 
disease (VAERD)’ was included as an important potential risk. At this stage, VAERD/VAED is still a 
theoretical risk. Non-clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S-immunised Syrian hamsters and NHP did not 
show evidence of VAED or VAERD, but showed an induction of neutralising antibodies and a Th1-
skewed immune response after Ad26.COV2.S dosing, suggesting that the theoretical risk of VAERD and 
VAED for Ad26.COV2.S is low. Data from clinical trials did not show any indication of the presence of 
VAED, including VAERD. However, as long-term safety and efficacy data are not yet available, the risk 
VAED/VAED remains an important potential risk. 
Missing information:  
‘Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding’: considering the limited data in pregnant women vaccinated 
with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (i.e. 8 pregnancies reported for trial COV3001; 4 in Ad26.COV2.S group 
and 4 in placebo group) and the planned Phase 2 study VAC31518COV2004, this issue should be 
included as missing information and further characterised as part of the pharmacovigilance plan.  
Considering the limited data in vaccinated breastfeeding women (i.e. 128 breastfeeding women 
received Ad26.COV2.S in trial COV3001), this population is considered as missing information. 
 ‘Use in immunocompromised patients’: the Ad26 platform data in HIV infected adults and the absence 
of replication of Ad26.COV2.S suggest that no safety issue is expected in this population. This should 
be further supported by clinical data from trial COV3009 as available. At the time of cMAA, no safety 
issue was raised in HIV subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S in the trial COV3001. However, only a 
very limited number of vaccinees were included in the Full Analysis Set (i.e. 601 (2.7%)). Moreover, 
HIV patients under treatment may represent a distinct population from other immunocompromised 
subjects, including patients under immunosuppressive treatment, transplant patients or patients with 
hereditary and/or acquired immunodeficiency disease states. Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
are planned to monitor this safety concern.  
‘Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders’: other sub-populations with clinical 
conditions stable under non-immunomodulator treatment (e.g. autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune 
inflammatory rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis) were included at very low number 
clinical development precluding the provision of meaningful data. This safety concern will be monitored 
as part of the pharmacovigilance plan.  
‘Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, 
chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders)’: subjects with comorbidities associated with 
increased risk of severe COVID-19 were included in the clinical development plan: i.e. 8,936 (40.8%) 
of vaccinees with one or more comorbidities were included in the COV3001 Full Analysis Set. However, 
the safety and efficacy of frail subjects who also have comorbidities associated with increased risk for 
severe COVID-19 has not yet been assessed and is considered as missing information. Additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are planned to characterise this missing information.  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 181/218 
 
 
 
‘Interaction with other vaccines’: co-administration of Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines has not been 
evaluated in clinical trials. However, data on interaction, mainly with flu and pneumococcal vaccines 
which are often given to elderly, are needed for vaccinators and prescribers. An interventional clinical 
trial is planned to further characterise this missing information.  
‘Long term safety data’: long term safety data are available at the time of the cMAA. The relevance of 
the long-term follow-up is discussed, and adequate pharmacovigilance activities are proposed. 
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
The reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from a vaccine, and it is considered acceptable 
to not include those events in the list of safety specifications. As usually observed, the reactogenicity 
profile differs with age, with lower and milder reported solicited events in older adults. 
Anxiety-related reactions can occur in anticipation or as a result of an injection of any kind. These 
reactions are not related to the vaccine, but to fear of the injection. The most commonly reported 
manifestations are fainting (syncope and presyncope), hyperventilation, vomiting. A statement on 
those reactions is included in section 4.4, and it is agreed that they do not require further 
characterisation or risk minimisation. 
Vaccination errors may be introduced in the context of mass vaccination campaign. The following 
situations have been identified as potential source of immunisation errors: risk to erroneously 
administer Ad26.COV2.S twice as a 2-dose schedule is implemented for other authorised vaccines in 
EU; risk to administer a higher dose of Ad26.COV2.S as multidose vials will be used, risk for 
Ad26.COV2.S being erroneously administered in adolescents aged 16-17 years as this age group is 
included in the indication of other manufacturer’s COVID-19 vaccines, and finally risk of mixed 
schedule. . Risk minimisation activities in the form of communication messages in the PI are 
considered adequate to minimise the risk. Vaccination errors reports will be monitored in the PSURs 
and monthly reports. 
‘Exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD)’: (i.e. asthma and COPD)’ An AE 
of asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the 
placebo group. For the majority of the participants (including the participant in the placebo group), the 
assessment of “not related” was made considering the nature of the condition and the subject’s 
medical history (including longstanding history of asthma). Besides, 1 subject reported 1 SAE of 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the COVID-19 group compared to none in the placebo group. 
Although the causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance with a significative number of cases 
with Ad26.COV2.S, the risk of exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) 
should be followed. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are taken in consideration for routine and additional 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
A set of AESI has been identified taking into consideration the available lists of AESIs from the 
Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC) (Law 2020), ACCESS protocol (2020), US CDC (preliminary list of AESI 
for VAERS surveillance) (Shimabukuro 2020), and MHRA (unpublished guideline). 
The proposed list of AESI is considered dynamic and may change following the evolving safety profile 
of the vaccine. Currently, medical conditions covered by the list of AESIs include Immune-mediated 
and (neuro-)inflammatory disorders (including Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy), Thrombotic 
and thromboembolic events, Major organ disorders (including neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, 
and respiratory), Events associated with COVID-19.

Conclusions on the safety specification  
It is agreed that the list of safety concerns in the RMP are appropriate. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
The applicant will follow standard pharmacovigilance processes, along with the additional actions 
referenced in the EU-RMP. The applicant has a Global Safety Database in place to manage the receipt, 
processing, and reporting of individual and aggregate safety data to regulatory authorities, and to 
support pharmacovigilance activities including safety signal detection and ongoing evaluation of the 
benefit-risk profile of the vaccine. 
ICSR reporting 
The applicant will submit Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) in accordance to EMA GVP guidance. 
Follow-up for spontaneous and solicited ICSRs 
ICSRs are followed up promptly to obtain additional information relevant to the report as necessary to 
provide a complete description of the safety event.  
Two specific adverse reaction follow up questionnaires will be used to collect follow-up information 
on reports of anaphylaxis, and vaccination failure/lack of effect, including events of VAED and VAERD. 
Monthly summary safety reports 
In line with EMA’s ‘Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines’ guidance. the 
applicant will submit monthly safety reports containing a review of safety information received during 
the reporting interval, as well as cumulative data. Topics covered by the monthly safety reports will 
include, at a minimum: 
• 
• 
• 
Interval and cumulative number of reports stratified by report type (medically confirmed/not) 
and by seriousness (including fatal separately). 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, overall and by age groups, and in special 
populations (e.g. pregnant women). 
Interval and cumulative number of reports per High Level Term and System Organ Class. 
•  Summary of the designated medical events. 
•  Reports per EU country. 
• 
Exposure data (including per EU country). 
•  Changes to reference safety information in the interval. 
•  Ongoing and closed signals in the interval. 
•  AESI and RMP safety concerns reports – numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analysis, 
where appropriate. 
• 
Fatal reports – numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analysis, where appropriate. 
•  Risk/benefit considerations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 183/218 
 
 
 
Pregnancy outcomes and sudden death are AEs of interest that will each be discussed in separate 
sections of the periodic reports. 
The need and frequency of submission of the summary safety reports will be reevaluated based on the 
available evidence from post-marketing six months after the conditional marketing authorisation of the 
vaccine. 
Literature review 
Literature monitoring for Ad26.COV2.S includes both an automated daily search for published and pre-
publication/online first references in 2 commercial database products (Embase and Ovid Medline), as 
well as a daily manual review of one or more literature aggregator services. Search criteria include any 
COVID-19 vaccine product, irrespective of manufacturer or vaccine technology, and a report of AE(s) 
without restriction by seriousness or severity. References retrieved by the above search strategies are 
reviewed by a healthcare professional and are escalated based on reporting of either new safety 
observations or new aspects of known risks that require further assessment. 
Signal Investigation 
All available safety information across clinical investigations, post-marketing data, and all other 
sources of information is reviewed on a regular basis. Other sources of pertinent data may include 
nonclinical studies, manufacturing and product quality reports, relevant publications, epidemiology 
data, data from external safety databases, safety-related health authority and healthcare provider 
queries, and safety-related health authority communications and assessment reports. 
Routine aggregate signal detection will include regular surveillance of AE reports received in the 
applicant’s Global Safety Database, irrespective of country of origin, seriousness, medical confirmation, 
or validity, as well as reviews of external databases. The Table below shows an outline of data sources 
and frequency of monitoring.

Traceability 
The SmPC includes instructions for healthcare professionals to: 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 184/218 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
clearly record the name and lot number of the administered vaccine to improve traceability 
(SmPC section 4.4); 
report any suspected adverse reactions including batch/lot number if available (section 4.8). 
Traceability is available for every shipping container of Ad26.COV2.S, which is fitted with a unique 
device that provides real-time monitoring of geographic location 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. 
Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the associated shipment. The device is activated prior to 
shipment and information is transmitted wirelessly to the applicant at a predefined cadence until 
delivery to each country’s government distribution center. Each shipment will be accompanied by a 
passive temperature datalogger. Alarms for excursions (per predefined specifications) are programmed 
into the device. If the display on the device doesn’t show an alarmed status, the vaccine can be 
received. If the display shows an alarmed status, the product needs to be stored in the appropriate 
temperature conditions upon arrival and the receiver needs to follow the applicant’s instructions for 
reporting an alarmed shipment. These data may be used for the assessment of a safety signal. 
The vaccine carton box also includes a 2D matrix barcode which has the batch/lot number, GTIN 
product code, and expiry date, should there be capability at a vaccination site to utilise this as an 
information source. 
Further, the applicant will make available vaccination cards to vaccinees that may be completed at the 
time of vaccination. The vaccination cards contain the following elements: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pre-printed vaccine brand name and manufacturer name. 
Placeholder space for name of vaccinee. 
Placeholder space for date of vaccination and associated lot number. 
For EEA countries, reference to the National Reporting System for AE reporting. 
•  QR code and URL (www.covid19vaccinejanssen.com) for additional product information. 
In addition to the vaccination cards, 2 stickers per dose, containing pre-printed vaccine brand name, 
lot information, and a 2D matrix barcode will be made available to support documentation of the lot 
information on both the vaccination cards for vaccinees and in the vaccinee medical records in mass 
vaccination centers. It is acknowledged that some countries may require utilisation of nationally 
mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document the lot number; therefore, the available 
vaccination cards and stickers with printed lot information may not be utilised in all countries. The use 
will depend on national requirements and/or national competent authority guidance. 
The following milestones apply for the availability of the stickers with printed lot information: 
• 
• 
For EEA countries: sticker sheets with printed lot information will be provided at the same time 
and alongside the vial cartons from initial launch. 
Projected 2022: Upon development and approval of single-dose vials, stickers with printed lot 
information will be available inside the vial box or carton around it. 
The proposed routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered appropriate for the safety profile of 
the product and the pandemic circumstances.

Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The applicant proposes the following 11 studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness, and to 
address missing information in the post marketing setting. There are six interventional studies and five 
non-interventional studies (five safety and two on effectiveness).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.4 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 25 February 2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the 25 February 2021 to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that adenovirus type 26 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 
(Ad26.COV2-S) has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union. 
The active substance Ad26.COV2.S is a recombinant adenoviral vector that contains the sequence that 
encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. After administration, the replication incompetent 
adenoviral particles will infect cells and the sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein will 
be transcribed into mRNA and subsequently translated into SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (which will 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 192/218 
 
 
 
serve as antigen to evoke an immune response). Although the adenoviral particle itself does not 
contain any SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the coding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
glycoprotein is an integral part of the genome of the adenoviral construct. Therefore, the adenoviral 
particle as an entity should be considered as active substance (and not just the coding sequence of the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein). 
Although recombinant replication incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 has been previously used in 
different constructs, this vector has never been used for expression of SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein 
and/or as a Covid-19 viral vector vaccine. 
Other Covid-19 vaccines or medicinal products that are currently registered do not contain 
recombinant replication incompetent Ad26 viral vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein as 
active substance. 
In conclusion, since a medicinal product containing recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus 
serotype 26 vectored vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has not been previously 
authorised in the EU, the active substance Ad26.COV2.S (recombinant, replication-incompetent 
adenovirus serotype 26 vectored vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein) is considered a 
new active substance in itself. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers adenovirus type 26 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
glycoprotein (Ad26.COV2-S) to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling and serialisation requirements have been granted on the basis 
of article 63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the 
context of the flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 
vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) document which aims at facilitating the 
preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing 
packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-
19 vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal framework. 
EU packaging specific derogations 
a) Outer and immediate labelling in English only (from start of supply until end 2021) 
Outer and immediate labelling will be provided in English only for all EU Member States, as well as 
Norway and Iceland.  
Country/language specific outer/immediate labelling shall be provided in all EU languages by beginning 
2022. 
This exemption is justified on the necessity to provide maximum flexibility of supply and speed of 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 193/218 
 
 
 
vaccine production/deployment due to the ongoing pandemic. Production of different vaccine packs in 
different languages will significantly reduce the supply chain efficiency. The multiple changes on 
packaging lines will result in significant time and capacity losses and would slow down the rapid 
deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. The use of unified English-only pack components will allow the 
vaccine to be distributed across multiple countries simultaneously.  
A QR code and URL printed on the outer carton, QR card and the patient information leaflet will provide 
access to the product information in the national language(s).  
b) Printed package leaflet in English only (from start of supply until end 2021) 
A printed package leaflet (PL) will be provided in the national language(s) for those MSs that require 
so. All other MSs, that have granted a temporary exemption for an English-only PL, will receive the 
English printed PL. Moreover, the MAH shall contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs 
to be distributed in line with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities. 
A QR code and URL printed on the outer carton, QR card and the PL will provide access to the package 
leaflet in the national language(s).  
Moreover, the MAH shall contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed in 
line with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities.  
The MAH shall provide a printed package leaflet in all EU languages by beginning 2022. The MAH shall 
engage with the National Competent Authorities (other than the 6 mentioned above) to discuss and 
speed up the provision of PLs in the respective national language(s) of the MSs concerned. The MAH 
shall also contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed, again in line 
with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities. 
c) Outer and immediate labelling. Temporary omission of certain particulars on the labelling (from start 
of supply to end 2021). 
The following exemptions are temporarily agreed for the outer labelling. These exemptions are justified 
on the necessity to label batches ahead of time.  
Outer carton and printed package leaflet 
o  Common name: 'COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S (recombinant))' (initially proposed), instead 
of 'COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant])' (agreed during evaluation [with square 
brackets]). This exemption on the common name is temporarily agreed for the outer carton 
and the printed package leaflet for the first batches until end 2021. 
Outer carton 
o  Statement of the active substance. Due to the expedited development, product specifications 
were not final at the early stage of printing packaging materials. Therefore, the statement of 
active substance will be fully omitted from the outer carton for the first batches until end 2021.  
o  Abbreviated MAH name and company logo  
d) EU Marketing Authorisation number (from start of supply to end 2021) 
The inclusion of the EU Marketing Authorisation number in the labelling will be implemented with the 
switch to national variants of the EU packaging by beginning 2022. The MA number will be available on 
the electronic version of the EUPI.  
e) Blue Box (from start of supply to end 2021) 
Due to the use of one unified pack across all the EU countries, an exemption for the Blue Box has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 194/218 
 
 
 
 
granted to omit it from the outer carton.  
The information normally provided in the market specific packaging Blue Box area of the carton will be 
provided as an electronic version on the website (via the QR code/URL) under the country page, if 
required by the National Competent Authorities in each MS. The QR code and URL address (website) 
will be made available on the PL, carton box and QR card. 
The Blue Box will be included in the updated carton component when national variants of the 
packaging will be possible by beginning 2022. 
f) QR card (from start of supply to end 2021) 
One QR card will be supplied in each carton box. The QR card will include a QR code and an URL 
address (website) that links to an electronic product information translated in all EU languages.  
h) Manufacturers responsible for batch release (from start of supply to end 2021) 
Due to the use of two manufacturers responsible for batch release for the supply of this vaccine in the 
EU, an exemption is requested for not indicating which is the manufacturer responsible for the release 
of the concerned batch in the printed package leaflet. This request is justified to meet capacity 
demands, and to ensure there is sufficient flexibility to accommodate for possible delays at some 
manufacturing sites or unavailability of release capacity. 
Both manufacturers responsible for the batch release will be listed in the printed package leaflet. In 
addition, the following sentence: “For the specific manufacturer of the vaccine you have received, 
check the Lot number on the carton or vial and please contact the local representative of the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder.” will be included in the package leaflet for traceability purposes.  
Exemption from the obligation of serialisation 
- All EU Member States have accepted a temporary derogation from serialisation for the EU pack for a 
period of 3 months starting from the EC decision date. 
- the MAH shall provide monthly progress reports on the serialisation: referring to details on the 
progress achieved in terms of ensuring compliance, e.g. proof of acquiring the relevant equipment, the 
date for the validation, the proof of contract to connect to the European Medicines Verification 
Organisation; 
- the MAH shall provide additional mitigating measures, e.g. immediate reporting of any stolen product 
during the period of exemption, reporting of any counterfeit or falsified vaccine in the EU or third 
countries in the legal supply or internet, reconciliation of product distributed and used in the respective 
territory; 
- the MAH should also consider technical solutions to the serialisation due to the risk of falsification.

Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: 
Statutory information 
•  Approved regulatory information, including the patient information leaflet (PIL) and Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
•  Vaccination Card; 
•  Blue Box information as required by each Member State; 
•  Storage, dosing and administration brochure; 
•  Access to the national reporting systems for adverse events websites; 
•  Contact numbers for more information on the COVID-19 vaccine including product quality 
complaints; 
• 
Link to the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen on the EMA website. 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (adenovirus 
serotype 26 vector encoding sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein (Ad26.COV2-S)) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing 
authorisation. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is active immunisation for the prevention of 
coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. 
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The virus has spread 
worldwide during 2020, causing WHO to declare a pandemic in March 2020.  
The virus infects the airways and causes a broad spectrum of respiratory symptoms ranging from 
asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and ARDS. The pandemic is still 
ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak.

Available therapies and unmet medical need 
COVID-19 case management has evolved during 2020 and includes, among others, anti-viral therapy 
and anti-inflammatory agents. In EU, remdesivir has been granted a conditional marketing 
authorisation for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 40 kg) with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen 
or other non-invasive ventilation at start of treatment) based on positive results in some subgroups 
from clinical study NIAID-ACTT-1, in which remdesivir could speed up the recovery time with 4 to 6 
days (Beigel 2020, EMA 2020b).  
Dexamethasone can be considered a treatment option for adult and adolescent patients who require 
supplemental oxygen therapy based on published data from the RECOVERY study which showed a 
relative reduction in the number of deaths within 28 days of 35% compared to usual care in patients 
on invasive mechanical ventilation and 20% in patients receiving oxygen therapy without mechanical 
ventilation. 
There remains an urgent public health need for the rapid development of novel prophylactic therapies, 
including vaccines, both for protection of particularly vulnerable groups as well as mitigating the effects 
of the pandemic on a population level. Several vaccine candidates are being developed and three of 
them (Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) were granted a 
conditional marketing authorisation in the EU. There is a very high global demand for suitable vaccines 
to help counteract the ongoing pandemic. 
Main clinical studies 
Five studies are ongoing with Ad26.COV2.S, of which 3 Phase 1/2 studies evaluate the immunogenicity 
and safety of Ad26.COV2.S and 2 large phase 3 trials evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults. The first efficacy trial, VAC31518COV3001, is the pivotal 
study for this application. 
The trial VAC31518COV3001 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study in adults 
≥18 years of age conducted in the US, several Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, 
Mexico, Colombia), and South Africa. Participants were randomised in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp or placebo intramuscularly. Individuals are planned to be 
followed for up to 24 months. The trial design was revised after EUA in the US (on February 27, 2021) 
to offer Ad26.COV2.S vaccination within the trial (for participants who had received placebo), and 
unblinding of participants and investigators. All participants will be encouraged to remain in the study 
and continue to be followed for efficacy/effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity as originally planned 
for up to 2 years post-vaccination on Day 1. 
A total of 43,783 randomised participants received the study vaccine (21,895 and 21,888 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms). Randomisation was stratified by site, age group (≥18-<60 years of 
age vs ≥60 years of age), and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or might be associated with 
an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S for the co-primary endpoint ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ with an 
onset from Day 14 after vaccination was 66.9% (adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40) over a median 
follow-up time of 58.0 days, in seronegative individuals. For the co-primary endpoint ‘moderate to 
severe/critical COVID-19’ with an onset from Day 28 after vaccination, efficacy was 66.1% (adjusted 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 197/218 
 
 
 
95% CI: 55.01; 74.80) over the same period, in seronegative individuals. The primary objective was 
met for both co-primary endpoints since the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI of vaccine efficacy were 
above the pre-specified limit of 30%.  
Number of cases and efficacy estimates were consistent when using the US FDA Harmonized (CDC) 
COVID-19 case definition or when using the endpoint ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ cases which include 
cases classified as either mild, or moderate to severe/critical (66.9% [95% CI: 59.07; 73.37] >14 
days and 66.5% [95% CI: 55.50; 75.05] >28 days). There were very few mild cases, and the vast 
majority of ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ cases were thus captured by the primary endpoint. These data 
therefore support an indication against COVID-19 of any severity. 
For this reason, ‘COVID-19’ is used in the SmPC section 5.1 to describe for the primary outcome of the 
study. It is considered misleading to use the exact primary endpoint of ‘moderate to severe/critical 
COVID-19’ as it could suggest that the cases corresponding to the primary endpoint were more severe 
compared to other vaccines’ trials, which is not the case.  
Efficacy against severe disease was demonstrated. Of the 116 vs. 348 primary endpoint cases with an 
onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 14 (12%) vs. 60 
(17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe, also in the SmPC). The point 
estimate of VE against severe disease was 76.7% (adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09) over a median 
follow up of 58 days, in SARS-COV-2 seronegative subjects. Of the 66 vs. 193 primary endpoint cases 
with an onset at least 28 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 5 (8%) 
vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe. VE against severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (adjusted 
95% CI: 54.15; 96.90) over the same follow-up period in seronegative subjects. Of the 14 vs. 60 
severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. placebo 
group, 2 vs. 6 were hospitalised. Three died (all in the placebo group). Most of the remaining cases 
only fulfilled the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (SpO2<93%). For many cases 
this was based on self-measured abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (at home). During the COVID-
19 event, at least one measurement was taken by the investigator’s site or by a home visit by 
investigator’s personnel. All cases were adjudicated by an independent committee of clinical experts. 
The cumulative incidence curves of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases 
(Kaplan Meier) for the placebo and vaccinated groups suggests that the onset of protection is around 
Day 14 post-vaccination.  
There were 2 vs. 8 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation at least 14 days 
after vaccination in the active vs. placebo group, respectively. The finding was supported by post-hoc 
analyses which identified 2 vs. 29 cases of all COVID-19 related hospitalisations by implementing a 
broader search based on all available information (including SAE forms) in the extended data set, i.e. 
all COVID-19 cases with a positive PCR result, including all cases from a local laboratory result not yet 
confirmed by the central laboratory at the time of the analysis. 
In participants ≥65 years, based on the primary endpoint, efficacy was 82.4% (95% CI: 63.90; 92.38) 
after 14 days post-vaccination and 74.0% (95% CI: 34.40; 91.35) after 28 days post-vaccination.  
In the PP analysis set, 40% of the participants had at least one comorbidity, the most common being 
obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 28%), hypertension (10%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.5%), followed by 
serious heart conditions (2.5%), HIV infection (2.5%), asthma (1.5%), COPD (1%). It should be noted 
that only participants with stable conditions were enrolled. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed 
‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ was observed both in participants with and without 
comorbidities with point estimates respectively of 62.9% and 69.1% for cases with onset at least 14 
days after vaccination, and 48.6% and 72.6% for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination.

Efficacy against molecularly confirmed ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ was demonstrated in 
each participating country. Except for South Africa, all point estimates were >65% for events with 
onset at least 14 days after vaccination (not computed in Chile and Mexico due to small numbers of 
cases).  
In South Africa, vaccine efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other regions/countries (39.6% 
[95% CI: 8.77; 60.46] for cases with onset at least 14 days and 57.3% [95% CI: 26.51; 76.03] for 
cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination). Heterogeneity across regions was much less 
marked when considering the PCR positive cases from any source (including those not yet confirmed 
by the central laboratory) (South Africa: 52.0% [95% CI: 30.26; 67.44] for cases with onset at least 
14 days, 64.0% [95% CI: 41.19; 78.66] for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination). 
Higher vaccine efficacy estimates were determined against severe disease (secondary endpoint). In the 
extended data set, when considering cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination, the VE 
against severe COVID-19 was consistently high, including in South Africa (73.1% [95% CI: 40.03; 
89.36] compared to 78.0% [95% CI: 33.13; 94.58] in the US and 89.1% [95% CI: 17.0; 98.0] in 
Brazil). When evaluated at least 28 days after vaccination, VE point estimates were above 81.7% and 
comparable between South Africa, the US and Brazil Colombia.  
The applicant has characterised the virus from 71.7% of the cases and it was found that, for South 
Africa, 94.5% of the sequences corresponded to the 20H/501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351 lineage, which 
shows 9 aminoacid differences and a deletion of two aminoacids in the S protein as compared to the 
strain included present in the vaccine), in Brazil 69.4% of the sequences corresponded to the variant 
from the P.2 lineage and 30.6% to the Wuhan-Hu1 reference sequence+D614G variant, whereas in the 
USA 96.4% of the sequences corresponded to the Wuhan-Hu1 reference sequence+D614G. As there 
were predominant variants in the USA and South Africa, VE in those countries are likely to reflect the 
efficacy against the respectively circulating variants. These results predict high vaccine efficacy in case 
the South-African variant 20H/501Y.V2 spreads globally. 
Ad26.COV2.S elicited both humoral (close to 100% seroconversion) and cellular immune responses in 
vaccinated subjects, as early as 14 days post-vaccination, in both young and older adults. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Duration of protection beyond 8 weeks is not known. Efficacy data are not available after this 
timepoint. Long-term vaccine efficacy data will become available from post-authorisation effectiveness 
studies and from the ongoing clinical trials. However, participants in the placebo arm are being 
unblinded and offered vaccination following the FDA EUA for this vaccine. Therefore, it is unclear 
whether robust efficacy data can be generated. Preliminary immunogenicity results from the FIH trial 
demonstrated antibody persistence up to 3 months post-vaccination. Whether antibody titers will 
persist over a longer period of time is not known. Also, to date, no immunological correlate of 
protection has been established. 
Whether efficacy is higher against severe cases compared to all symptomatic cases is not confirmed 
yet, but there is a trend in that direction. Data suggest that efficacy point estimates tend to increase 
with the degree of severity of the case definition. For the severe COVID-19 case definition efficacy was 
76.7% and 85.4%, while for the moderate COVID-19 case definition efficacy was 64.8% and 62.0%, 
respectively after 14 days and after 28 days. 
The efficacy was demonstrated in the overall participants aged 18 years and older, and in participants 
≥65 years. However, the number of cases in individuals aged 75 and older at highest risk of severe 
COVID-19 is limited. No COVID-19 cases were detected in individuals aged ≥80 years. As baseline 
Assessment report

frailty status was not assessed, no information on efficacy data in frail subjects was obtained. Long 
term health care residents were not studied for this application. 
Efficacy was demonstrated in trial participants with and without comorbidities. Point estimates tend to 
be lower in participants with comorbidities, but the 95% CIs are overlapping. When considering 
efficacy after 28 days, when the numbers of events are the lowest, for the older participants with 
comorbidities, the lower limit of the 95% CI was <0. For cases with onset at least 28 days post-
vaccination, vaccine efficacy was 33.2% (95% CI: -77.59; 76.33) for participants ≥60 years and 
44.0% (-85.99; 85.26) for participants ≥65 years. The 95% CI are very wide as estimates are based 
on few events. At this stage it is not considered that there is an efficacy concern in individuals with 
comorbidities. Given the nature of the comorbidities (i.e. no immunocompromised participants), there 
is low biological plausibility for a significantly low efficacy in these study participants. Nevertheless, 
efficacy by age and comorbidities will need to be assessed over a longer FU time to generate more 
robust estimates.  
Data are lacking in individuals with uncontrolled underlying disease and in those with several 
underlying diseases. Efficacy could not be assessed in participants with ≥3 comorbidities due to the 
limited number of cases. 
There is no data on immunocompromised persons due to condition or immunosuppressive therapies. 
The applicant is planning an immunogenicity trial in immunocompromised participants as described in 
the RMP. Considering the lack of an immunological correlates of protection (ICP) and the 
heterogeneous nature of the various types of immune deficiencies, only some of which may impact on 
the immune response to a specific type of vaccine, the applicant is recommended to discuss the study 
design with competent authorities prior to study start.  
Findings related to asymptomatic cases are preliminary since Day 71 samples were available for 6% of 
the FAS seronegative population. After 28 days post-vaccination, efficacy was 59.7% (95% CI: 32.75; 
76.64) for the prevention of undetected/asymptomatic COVID-19 based on seroconversion to the 
SARS-COV-2 N protein and/or on positive PCR. Of the undetected/asymptomatic cases, most of the 
cases were ascertained based on seroconversion. These preliminary data are promising, as they 
suggest efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection, at a level that may be consistent with 
efficacy against symptomatic disease.  
Preliminary data suggest no impact of vaccination on upper respiratory tract viral load levels and 
duration of virus shedding in COVID-19 breakthrough cases, but this finding will need to be confirmed 
when the whole data set will become available. 
It is not known if the vaccine prevents reinfection in those who are SARS-COV-2 seropositive at 
baseline, because efficacy could not be estimated as the number of cases was very low. Of 4,156 
participants SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, 7 COVID-19 cases were reported as PCR positive 
from any source (3 vs. 4 in the active vs. placebo group after Day 14) of which one was confirmed by 
the central laboratory. However, efficacy is anticipated in this group. The immunogenicity data, albeit 
limited, support this assumption.  
Concomitant administration with other vaccines has not been studied. A study evaluating the safety 
and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S co-administrated with seasonal influenza vaccine is planned in 
the RMP. 
An analysis of efficacy per variant was not performed. However, efficacy was demonstrated in South 
Africa where the South African variant 20H/501Y.V2 was predominant. Efficacy was demonstrated in 
Brazil, but there was no predominant variant in Brazil. Two third of the cases may be attributable to 
the P.2 lineage. Spike sequence data were available for only 70% of the cases and a higher proportion 
of samples were sequenced in the placebo group as compared to the vaccine group, which could lead 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 200/218 
 
 
 
to biases. An analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS-CoV-2 variant is planned upon completion of the 
sequencing.  
Preliminary data showed that neutralising antibodies elicited by Ad26.COV2.S were able to neutralise 
the B.1.1.7 lineage variant in vitro, although less efficiently than the reference strain. Thus, some 
protection against this variant too is anticipated.  
More data should be generated post-authorisation to continue assessing vaccine efficacy against these 
variants. The extent and the onset of cross-protection against other relevant circulating or newly 
emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and should be investigated post-authorisation.  
Ad26 seroprevalence varies across regions, with higher seroprevalence reported in Africa. In Europe 
seroprevalence is around 12%. Preliminary results of the COVID-19 program do not indicate a major 
impact of pre-existing Ad26-nAb on the vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding Ab responses, 
but this issue needs to be followed up post-authorisation. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The assessment of Ad26.COV2.S safety is based on the Phase 3 study COV3001 (up to the cut-off date 
of 22 January 2021), comprising 43,783 participants who received either a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
at 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo (21,888 adults) (FAS). Reactogenicity data were collected in a 
subset of 6,736 participants who received either vaccine (3,356 adults) or placebo (3,380 adults) 
(Safety subset). Information on unsolicited AEs was collected for 28 days after vaccination, information 
on AESIs and SAEs is collected for the entire study duration. At the time of the primary analysis, the 
median follow-up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups.  
Any solicited local and systemic AEs were reported more frequently in Ad26.COV2.S than in the control 
group (66% and 41.9% of evaluated participants respectively, within the first 7 days following 
injection). The most frequently reported solicited local AE after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was injection 
site pain (48.7% vs. 16.7%, respectively). The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were 
headache (39% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue (38.3% vs. 21.6%, 
respectively), and myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). Pyrexia was reported in 9.0% participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (vs. 0.6% of participants in the placebo group). Most solicited AEs were transient 
and self-timing. Overall, the median duration of the selected solicited AEs was similar in both groups (1 
to 2 days after vaccination), and also the median time to onset (within 1 to 3 days after vaccination). 
Solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited AEs was low 
overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2.2%) compared to participants in the 
placebo group (0.7%). There was no grade 4 solicited AEs.  
In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported was low and similar in both (13.1% vs. 
12%, respectively). Unsolicited AEs were largely consistent with solicited AEs observed following 
vaccination, such as headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain. The most frequent 
unsolicited ADRs that were not recorded as solicited AEs were chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, 
muscular weakness and pain in extremity. Most reported unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity. There was a similar frequency of participants with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both 
groups. The frequency of unsolicited AEs that were considered related to vaccination was higher in 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group as compared to placebo (7.2% vs. 4.6%, respectively). 
Up to the cut-off date , in the FAS, the same frequency of subjects reported at least one treatment 
emergent AESI in both groups (0.6%). Few reported AESIs were assessed as related (0.2% vs. 0.1%, 
respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 201/218 
 
 
 
Fewer deaths were observed in the Ad26.COV.2.S group (3, none confirmed to be associated with 
COVID-19) compared to the placebo group (16, including 6 confirmed to be associated with COVID-
19). In the FAS, 0.4% subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.6% subjects in the placebo group 
reported 1 or more non-fatal SAEs. However, a similar frequency of subjects reported SAEs not 
associated with COVID-19 in both groups (0.4%). Of the 227 SAEs reported, 7 SAEs (reported for 7 
participants) in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3 SAEs (reported for 2 participants) in the placebo group 
were considered to be possibly related to the vaccination. The reported SAEs considered related by the 
investigator for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were Guillain-Barré syndrome, pericarditis, brachial 
radiculitis, post-vaccination syndrome, Type IV hypersensitivity and 2 cases of facial paralysis 
Overall, the safety profile of the vaccine was similar independently of the subgroups. However, 
reactogenicity was milder and less frequent in older adults aged ≥65 years compared to the younger 
adults aged ≥18 to 64. Higher reactogenicity was reported in females compared to males (although 
both subgroups had a similar median age). 
In study COV3001, the most frequently reported ‘non-anaphylactic allergic reactions’ were rash (24 vs. 
16; 10 related vs. 6 related, respectively), urticaria (8 vs. 3; 3 related vs. none, respectively), and 
hypersensitivity (6 in the vaccine group including 1 related, 4 in the placebo group of which none 
related). Moreover, since the data lock, a SUSAR was reported which meet the Brighton Collaboration 
case definition criteria for anaphylaxis from an ongoing study in South Africa. Hypersensitivity, rash, 
urticaria, and anaphylaxis are considered at least possibly causally related to vaccination and have 
thus been listed as ADRs in the SmPC. Anaphylaxis is also considered as an important identified risk in 
the RMP. 
Regarding immune-mediated neurological disorders, there was 1 subject with Guillain-Barré syndrome 
in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible temporal 
relationship, 1 non-related SAE in placebo group). The risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome is included in 
the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
There were 3 cases of Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as 
possibly related SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the Sponsor; and 1 non-related AE) 
compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non-related). Based on data from reported events, a 
causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell’s palsy could not be confirmed nor ruled 
out (at least 2 cases possibly related to the vaccine). Bell’s palsy is included in the list of AESIs subject 
to routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities, but not in the SmPC as there is no clear 
imbalance vs. placebo. 
A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thrombotic events with 11 subjects in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (6 DVT8 type events, 4 pulmonary embolism, 1 transverse sinus thrombosis; 6 
SAEs; 8 events occurred within 28 days following vaccination) vs. 4 in the placebo group (2 DVT 
events, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 thrombosed haemorrhoid; 2 SAEs; all within 28 days of vaccination). 
Two of these cases were considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator (1 in each group). 
However, as the majority of the participants had underlying medical conditions (such as obesity, 
hypothyroidism, diabetes) that could have contributed to the thrombotic and thromboembolic events, 
the causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and venous thrombotic events was not 
shown. Venous thromboembolism has been included as an important potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns of the RMP. 
Asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the placebo 
group, although most were unrelated to study treatment . In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
8 includes one event reported as venous thrombosis limb and one event reported as embolism venous

disorders, 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the Ade26.COV2.S group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 
Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax 
spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, 
Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). Although the 
causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance in the number of cases vs. placebo, the risk of 
exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monitored in the 
planned PASS as an AESI (pending feasibility assessment that will be included in the draft protocol). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow-up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. 
Longer safety follow-up of >2 months is available for 23,903 participants in the FAS: 11,948 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (54.6%) and 11,955 in the placebo group (54.6%). However, 
only 34 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.2%) and 31 in the placebo group (0.1%) have been 
followed for up to 4 months. Long-term safety data is not yet available and will be characterised as 
part of the continuation of the pivotal clinical trial, other trials and a PASS.  
No safety issues were identified in vaccinated seropositive subjects, however, due to the limited 
number of subjects in the safety subset, no definitive conclusions can be drawn (154 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 147 in the placebo group). 
There is no data in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant 
therapy, thus the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in these individuals will be evaluated post-authorisation as 
described in the RMP.  
There is only very limited clinical experience in pregnant women with Ad26.COV2.S (4 exposed 
pregnant women). However, there were a significant number of pregnancy cases (1,631) reported for 
the Ad26 platform safety data (cut-off 21 December 2020; mainly from Ebola vaccine trials N=1,522) 
of which 280 were exposed during the first trimester). In addition, data from non-clinical studies do 
not indicate any harm during pregnancy. In the absence of clinical data with Ad26.COV2.S to confirm 
the favourable profile seen with other antigens, risks during pregnancy remains theoretical. 
Considering the Ad26 vector is a non-replicating vector, and considering the small amount that is 
administered intramuscularly, it is deemed unlikely that this vaccine may pose a specific risk during 
pregnancy, apart from the risk that may be associated with a fever-reaction. Use of Ad26.COV2.S in 
pregnant women will be investigated in the planned PASS.  
Although, in COV3001, up to the cut-off date of 31 December 2020, 128 breastfeeding women were 
enrolled in Ad26.COV2.S group, no data on shedding in breastmilk was collected during the study. Use 
in breastfeeding women will be investigated via a PASS. 
The available data (non-clinical, clinical, neutralising capacity of antibodies) do not raise a concern 
regarding vaccine-associated-enhanced disease for the time being. However, the possibility of 
enhanced disease cannot be excluded with certainty. The RMP lists VAED (including vaccine-associated 
enhanced respiratory disease - VAERD) as an important potential risk to be followed up post-
authorisation. 
Co-administration with other vaccines was not studied, but a co-administration study of Ad26.COV2.S 
with seasonal influenza vaccine is planned. 
In the COV3001 FAS, there were 21,895 adults ≥18 years of age, including 809 adults ≥75 years of 
age (3.7%), of which 495 adults had comorbidities (2.3%), and 8,936 adults with comorbidities 
(40.8%), of which 2,271 adults were ≥65 years of age(10.4%). Frailty has not been evaluated yet. 
Therefore, use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, 
Assessment report

diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) will be investigated via the ongoing 
study COV3001 and in the planned PASS.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, the efficacy of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp has been 
demonstrated for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 in adults ≥18 years of age, as well as an 
acceptable safety profile, based on the large pivotal phase 3 trial included in this MAA. 
The results are considered robust based on the study design and are further supported by the different 
secondary endpoints and analyses.  
Ad26.COV2.S has been shown to protect against severe disease. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed efficacy for elderly (≥65 years), as well as 
for participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19, which is 
considered as the population at highest need for preventative strategies.  
Efficacy against COVID-19 was demonstrated in each participating country, including South Africa 
(where the variant of concern 20H/501Y.V2 was the predominant circulating strain during the study), 
although efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries.

The main shortcoming of the current efficacy dataset is the unusually short median follow up of 
approx. 58 days, but longer-term data will be submitted post-authorisation as detailed in the specific 
obligation and recommendations. More data will be generated post-authorisation to further 
characterise longer term protection. In the current situation this gap in knowledge is outweighed by 
urgent need, high COVID-19 disease burden, and limited availability of preventative and therapeutic 
remedies. 
It would be desirable to confirm if this vaccine also has an effect on asymptomatic infection and viral 
transmission. These aspects cannot be evaluated fully based on clinical trials data and will likely be 
further elucidated through effectiveness studies post-authorisation. 
The observed safety profile is considered well characterised and acceptable based on the short-term 
data available. The safety of Ad26.COV2.S is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions 
occurring during the first 7 days after vaccination. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate, transient 
and self-limited. The reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged ≥65 years compared to 
the younger adults aged ≥18 to 64. SAEs and AESIs were infrequent in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo 
groups. 
Long term safety has to be characterised further, and it is important to analyse the full year safety 
follow-up of the ongoing trials. The current dataset gives no indication of vaccine-enhanced disease, a 
potential risk that should be followed up as detailed in the RMP.  
There is limited clinical experience in pregnant women with Ad26.COV2.S, but a significant experience 
was accumulated with the Ad26 platform. In addition, preliminary preclinical data are reassuring; 
therefore, noting that pregnancy as such is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, that pregnant women 
may additionally belong to other risk groups, and that a protective effect is anticipated, vaccination 
may be considered on a case by case basis. Data in pregnancy will be generated post-authorisation, as 
detailed in the RMP. Although breastfeeding women were included in the clinical studies with 
Ad26.COV2.S, there are no data available. However based on biological plausibility, no risk in 
vaccinating breast-feeding women is anticipated.  
Immunocompromised individuals were excluded from the efficacy trial. Some immunocompromised 
individuals may not be protected as well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. However, no 
safety issues are anticipated, and the B/R balance in immunocompromised subjects is deemed 
positive, also in light of the underlying excess risk of COVID-19. Further data will be collected post-
authorisation as detailed in the RMP. Also, subjects with severe underlying diseases were not included 
in the studies, and the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in these groups will be followed up post-
authorisation as detailed in the RMP.  
Regarding seropositive subjects, no safety issues have been observed in this population, and efficacy 
can be anticipated. Therefore, the vaccine can be administered without performing previous SARS-
CoV-2 serology testing. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the demonstrated favourable effect and considering the overall characteristics of the 
unfavourable effects, a positive B/R balance in the proposed indication is concluded.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Given the current emergency situation, it is considered that the identified uncertainties could be 
addressed post-authorisation through specific obligations, including the continuation of the pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 206/218 
 
 
 
clinical study as long as possible, and post-approval effectiveness studies and routine safety 
surveillance. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of the vaccine.  
The active substance and finished product are acceptable in relation to control of critical quality 
attributes and impurities.  
Studies to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency of the finished product in terms of process validation 
studies/process performance qualification studies (PPQ) have not been fully completed in the finished 
product  commercial  manufacturing  site  Catalent  Indiana.  Nonetheless,  sufficient  data  have  been 
provided for full scale lots (including some PPQ lots) at the commercial sites and at other sites using the 
commercial process.  
Considering the above and the current public health emergency, the information provided on the 
manufacturing of the finished product is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, in order to confirm 
the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the applicant should provide the 
completed process validation (including hold times) and comparability data for the Catalent Indiana 
site as a post-approval specific obligation. It is considered likely that the applicant will be able to 
provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific obligation.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
Based upon the applicant’s justification and commitment, detailed plans have been agreed with the 
applicant and reflected in the quality part of this assessment regarding data to be generated and 
submitted with interim milestones for assessment by the CHMP in order to complete the proposed 
specific obligation.  
Based on the applicant’s plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil the quality SO will 
be submitted gradually between March and August2021. 
Furthermore,  the  applicant  will  continue  the  ongoing  pivotal  Phase  3  randomised,  placebo-controlled 
study COV3001 to obtain 2-year long-term data and to ensure sufficient follow-up to confirm the efficacy 
and  safety  of  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen.  The  completion  of  the  Phase  3  study  COV3001  will  lead  to 
comprehensive date on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as  
There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of vaccines to prevent the global burden 
of disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Currently there are two mRNA 
vaccines and a monovalent vaccine composed of chimpanzee adenovirus encoding the SARS CoV-2 
spike glycoprotein (ChAdOx1-S) approved in the EU to prevent COVID-19. 
Despite the recent granting of a conditional marketing authorisation for Comirnaty, COVID-19 Vaccine 
Moderna, and COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca, there is still an urgent need to provide additional 
prophylactic options in the context of the pandemic across the EU. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021

The demonstrated efficacy and the satisfactory safety profile support the immediate availability of the 
product in the current emergency setting, notwithstanding the outlined uncertainties. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen is positive. 
Eligibility to a conditional marketing authorisation as well as fulfilment of the requirements have been 
demonstrated in line with provisions of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

The MAH is requested to discuss if the 
REC 
qualification (and validation) results of the 
initial WT-MNA could be generalised to MNA 
based assay using different strains and/or 
whether this will be addressed. 
Clinical  21 
The MAH is requested to provide data on cross-
REC 
neutralisation for clinically relevant and 
emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains by testing sera 
of human clinical participants (particularly of 
study VAC31518COV3001 in functional in vitro 
assays). 
Clinical  22 
The applicant is requested to present the plan 
REC 
regarding the assessment of the vaccine 
performance against emerging variants and/or 
performance of a new vaccine construct 
(including the Spike protein from a variant of 
concern) in protecting against COVID-19 if it 
appears that a new construct vaccine is needed 
in the future. 
Clinical  23 
The MAH should justify why, in study 
REC 
VAC31518COV2001, the anamnestic response 
will be assessed after a shorter interval 
between the primary vaccination and the 
antigen presentation for the 2-dose schedule 
when compared to the 1-dose schedule (final 
CSR). 
Clinical  24 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  present  the  data  on 
REC 
(and  discuss)  the  impact  of  the  natural  and 
vaccine-induced immunity to the Ad26 vector on

Clinical  27 
For study COV3001, the MAH should provide 
REC 
plans to address waning of immune responses 
and vaccine efficacy, and the need for and 
timing of booster, in the context of crossover 
vaccination and resulting loss of placebo-
controlled follow up. Provide SAP including 
these plans (including analyses at 6 months FU 
and before cross-over). The applicant is 
recommended to seek further interaction via 
EMA Scientific Advice on these points. 
Clinical  28 
For study COV3001, the MAH should provide 
REC 
cross-tabulation data linking seroconversion 
and RT-PCR results, for the various case 
definitions (symptomatic, mild, moderate to 
severe/critical COVID-19). 
Clinical  29 
For study COV3001, the MAH should provide 
REC 
validation document of whole genome 
sequencing assay. 
Clinical  30 
For study COV3001, the MAH is planning an 
REC 
immunogenicity trial in immunocompromised 
(IC) participants. Considering the lack of an 
ICP, and the heterogeneous nature of IC 
populations, the MAH is recommended to seek 
EMA Scientific Advice on the study design 
Clinical  31 
For study COV3001, there are differences in 
REC 
terms of follow up duration affect the 
comparisons of efficacy across age groups and 
across participants with/without comorbidities. 
Differences in terms of timing of vaccination 
could also affect the interpretation of certain 
subgroup analyses (given the emergence of 
variants for which efficacy could vary). The 
MAH needs to provide analyses (such as 
stratified/adjusted) taking account of these 
factors for an appropriate interpretation of the 
subgroup analyses. A discussion is expected, 
including an analysis of the biases that could 
have affected the subgroup analyses.  
Clinical  32 
For study COV3001, a detailed description of 
REC 
the cases found in seropositive participants, 
including genomic analysis, is expected in the 
final report to ensure an accurate assessment 
of the cases. Without details, whether these 
cases were real re-infection or rather re-
detection cannot be assessed. Any relevant

Clinical  33 
For study COV3001, when submitting updated 
REC 
data on asymptomatic cases as part of a 
further report, the MAH should present these 
data by variant, and include a discussion on 
the sources of biases (such as biases related to 
varying efficacy and clinical expression of 
disease across variants, differences in terms of 
follow up duration for the assessments of the 
endpoint). 
Clinical  34 
For study COV3001, in addition to the planned 
REC 
endpoint ‘asymptomatic or undetected COVID-
19’ based on PCR and seroconversion to the N 
protein, the analysis used an endpoint based 
on ‘seroconversion only’. An endpoint 
considering all seroconversions to the N protein 
(irrespective of the PCR result) appears more 
relevant and should be presented as well. 
Clinical  35 
For study COV3001, in the final CSR, the MAH 
REC 
should present the concordance between PCR 
results and seroconversion for the N protein 
serology, in symptomatic and asymptomatic 
cases with PCR results available (from the 
central lab, and from any source). 
Clinical  36 
In study COV3001, to assess the impact of 
REC 
excluding subjects with missing SARS-CoV-2 
serology status at baseline, a sensitivity 
analysis of VE on subjects seronegative at 
baseline only should be performed.

Safety– RR1 – REC. The applicant is recommended to submit, to support the development of future Ad26 
vaccines, an updated Advac report integrating the data from the COVID-19 vaccine. Several points to 
consider in this future report are raised below 
Clinical  42 
Baseline  characteristics:  Imbalance  between 
REC 
groups  were  observed 
the  AdVac  safety 
database  V5.  In  particular,  differences  have 
been  noticed  for  region  and  ethnicity.  In  the 
Ad26 
vaccination 
and  placebo  groups, 
respectively  37%  and  52.2%  of  the  subjects 
were  from  North  America,  and  26%  and  9.5% 
from West Africa. Moreover, there were 34.8% 
white  subjects  in  the  Ad26  vaccination  group 
and  48.5%  in  the  placebo  group;  and  60.3% 
black or African American subjects in the Ad26 
vaccination  group  and  46.8%  in  the  placebo 
group.  In  further  reports,  this  should  be 
explained  and impact  on  the  results  should  be 
discussed.  Immunity  to  the  vector  should  be 
presented  across  groups,  and  any  imbalance 
should be discussed. 
Clinical  43 
In  the  AdVac  safety  database  V5,  safety  data 
REC 
have  been  provided  irrespective  of  dose  level 
and per subject (cumulating AE after all doses). 
In 
further 
reports, 
the 
applicant 
is 
recommended to provide the solicited AEs data 
for  dose  level  5x1010  and  separately  for  other 
levels.  Data  should  be  presented 
dose 
separately,  after  dose  1  and  after  dose  2 
(compared to placebo). 
Clinical  44 
High  differences  of  frequency  of  solicited  local 
REC 
and systemic AE have been reported depending 
of  the  insert.  These  differences  are  difficult  to 
interpret given the confounding effect of several 
factors  which  could  influence  reactogenicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/158424/2021 
Page 216/218 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  the  frequency  of  solicited  local  and 
systemic AEs tended to be lower in individuals 
with  pre-existing  Ad26  VNA  positivity  at 
baseline  compared  those  without  pre-existing 
Ad26  VNA  positivity  at  baseline,  but  again  the 
independent effect of immunity to the vector is 
unclear.  There  were  also  differences 
in 
reactogenicity  profile  across  regions  and  age 
categories.  In  further  reports,  the  applicant 
should  list  the  factors  that  could  influence 
reactogenicity  and  provide  local  and  systemic 
solicited AE stratified for these factors, to allow 
for  a  better  understanding  of  the  independent 
influence of insert, pre-existing immunity to the 
vector, and other factors on reactogenicity. 
Clinical  45 
The frequency of solicited AE local and systemic 
REC 
is  generally  much  lower  in  West  Africa  than  in 
other regions (East and Southern Africa, North 
America, Europe, and Asia), both for the active 
and  placebo  groups.  Other  differences  were 
noted between African and other regions, such 
as  that  in  the  3  African  regions,  no  consistent 
difference  between  groups  was  observed  as  in 
America,  Europe,  and  Asia.  Moreover,  in  Ad26 
individuals,  the  frequency  of  severe  solicited 
systemic AEs (all, and related solicited systemic 
AEs)  was  lowest  in  East,  West  and  Southern 
Africa compared to the other 3 regions. Regional 
differences in safety were already noted in the 
Zabdeno  EPAR.  At  that  time,  the  applicant 
argued that cultural differences may explain the 
differences  in  reporting  rates  of  AEs  across 
countries  and  regions.  Discrepancies  across 
regions could also reflect differences in terms of 
pre-existing immunity to Ad26 (higher in Africa) 
and  methodological  differences  between 
studies.  These  discrepancies  across  regions 
should be discussed in further reports. 
Clinical  46 
In the AdVac safety database v5, the applicant 
REC 
stated  that  “solicited  local  and  systemic  AEs 
were  generally  collected  from  the  day  of 
vaccination  until  7  days  after  each  vaccination 
for all populations studied”, and “unsolicited AEs 
were collected up to 28-30 days/4 weeks post-
vaccination  in  most  studies”.  This  should  be 
clarified  in  further  reports.  If  any  differences 
across  studies/programmes,  they  should  be

described.  In  addition,  the  applicant  should 
provide information on the duration of studies. 
Clinical  47 
In  the  AdVac  safety  database  V5,  only  limited 
REC 
clinical safety data, and brief conclusions have 
been given for adults ≥60 years, based on data 
from  the  RSV  vaccine  clinical  development 
program.  In  further  reports,  the  applicant  is 
required to provide an adverse events table by 
age group (less than 65, between 65-74, 75-84 
and 85 and above) and to discuss it.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Provision of context and alignment regarding the definition 
and 6.1 of the SmPC to revise the definition of 
severe LH and FSH deficiency, aligning with current 
medical guidelines and clinical practice, to clarify 
follicular development as the treatment target and 
the use of GONAL-f in Medically Assisted 
Reproduction procedures for healthcare providers, 
and clarification of the pharmacokinetic and 
of severe LH and FSH deficiency based on current medical 
guidelines and standards of clinical care in section 4.1 of 
the SmPC, as well as description of the physiologic action of 
Gonal-f and its use in relevant clinical settings associated 
with Medically Assisted Reproduction in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. The section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated to include 
updated information on mechanism of action and 
pharmacodynamic properties of follitropin alfa. These 
pharmacodynamic effect. 
proposed revisions align with the CHMP positive 
opinion, dated 14 October 2021, for the Type II 
variation to update the SmPC for Pergoveris for the 
same indication (EMA/H/C/000714/II/0075), as 
Pergoveris is comprised of a fixed 2:1 ratio of 
follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa (r-hLH). 
The package leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the applicant has taken the opportunity to 
improve the Instructions for Use (IFU) layout and to 
implement the Medical Device Regulation in the IFU.

SPC the sentence relating to the efficacy of the r-FSH 
compared to u-FSH..  During this variation application the 
MAH applied to modify the section 4.2 of the SPC to 
remove the claim that recombinant FSH (r-FSH) is more 
effective than urinary FSH (u-FSH). In return the statement 
in section 4.2 was re-worded to present the fact that lower 
dose of r-FSH achieves the same result as the u-FSH. This 
statement was re-enforced by the re-submission of the 
data of three clinical studies (GF 8407, 22240 and 21884)

renewal.  The MAH have received 57 reports of allergic 
reactions. Out of these 10 were serious. The CHPM 
considered that the majority of reactions were broadly 
covered by the mild reactions already listed in section 4.8, 
but that some additions were necessary and the SPC has 
updated (section 4.8) to reflect these changes. The 
Package Leaflet (section 4) was updated accordingly.

one serious case) in clinical trials with GONAL-f. The MAH 
was also requested to add injection site reaction as a "very 
common" (>1/10) adverse reaction in men, as this reaction 
was only described as occurring in females in the section 
4.8 of the SPC. These adverse reactions were also added to 
section 4 of the Package Leaflet. The MAH also took this 
opportunity to include a sentence in the section 3 of the PIL

to update the Annexes according to the current version 7 of

Brief description of the product
TEZSPIRE™
Centralised
Chemical class:
Tezepelumab is a human mAb IgG2λ directed against TSLP.
Summary of mode of action:
Tezepelumab is an anti-TSLP, human mAb IgG2λ that binds to 
human TSLP with high affinity and prevents its interaction with 
the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. TSLP, an epithelial cell-
derived cytokine, occupies an upstream position in the 
inflammatory cascade and plays a central role in the initiation 
and persistence of airway inflammation in asthma. TSLP 
regulates immunity at the airway barrier surface, affecting 
dendritic cells and other innate and adaptive immune cells, and 
inducing downstream inflammatory processes and bronchial 
hyperresponsiveness. TSLP has also been shown to have indirect 
effects on airway structural cells (eg, fibroblasts and airway 
smooth muscle). In asthma, both allergic and non-allergic 
triggers induce TSLP production. Blocking TSLP with 
tezepelumab reduces levels of a broad spectrum of biomarkers 
and cytokines associated with inflammation (eg, blood 
eosinophils, FeNO, IgE, IL-5, and IL-13).
Important information about its composition:
Tezepelumab is a human mAb IgG2λ directed against TSLP, 
expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary CS-9 cell line. The 
molecule is a heterotetramer consisting of 2 heavy chains of the 
IgG2 subclass and 2 light chains of the lambda subclass, which 
are covalently linked through disulphide bonds.

AND TARGET POPULATION
II.
II.1
Incidence:
There are limited reports on asthma incidence data in the literature and none on the incidence 
of severe uncontrolled asthma. Data from the European Respiratory Health Survey conducted 
from 1999 to 2001 in 6 countries reported the incidence rate of asthma among adults to be 
2.2 cases per 1000 person-years [PY] (Torén et al 2004). The incidence rate of asthma was 
higher among adult females (2.9 cases per 1000 PY) than adult males (1.5 cases per 1000 PY). 
In the United States (US)-based Asthma Call-back Survey conducted from 2006-2008 (Winer 
et al 2012), the incidence of asthma diagnosis in the previous 12 months was estimated to be 
3.8 cases per 1000 in adults, compared with 12.7 cases per 1000 in children. The incidence of 
asthma was also higher among adult females (4.9/1000) than adult males (2.8/1000).
Prevalence:
Globally, the prevalence of asthma is approximately 358 million individuals (Global Initiative 
for Asthma [GINA], GINA 2020, GBD Collaborators 2017). The prevalence of asthma 
appears to range from 1% to 22% in different countries, with rates increasing over time in 
some, while stable in others (GINA 2020). Data from the European National Health and 
Wellness Survey of 37476 adults in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom 
(UK) reported the prevalence of diagnosed asthma to be 5.8% (Demoly et al 2009). Data from 
the World Health Survey conducted in 2002 to 2003 among adults (18 to 45 years) reported 
the prevalence of asthma to be 5.1% based on doctor diagnosis definition and 5.3% based on 
clinical asthma definition in Europe, varying from 1% to 20% by country (To et al 2012).

Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
Severe asthma is characterised by either requiring use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) plus long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) or asthma controllers to achieve asthma control, 
or remaining uncontrolled despite use of these medications (GINA 2020, Chung et al 2014). 
The prevalence of severe asthma as a percentage of all asthma varies from country to country, 
largely due to variation between clinical and epidemiological definitions (Wenzel 2003) and is 
estimated to be 5% to 10% of the total asthmatic population (Barnes and Woolock 1998, 
Busse et al 2000, O’Byrne et al 2012, Chung et al 2014), whilst based on GINA criteria, 
approximately 20% of asthma patients have severe asthma, of which 20% are inadequately 
controlled (Peters et al 2006). A multi-country database study using the severe asthma 
definition of high-dose ICS plus a second controller therapy for ≥ 120 days, reported severe 
asthma prevalence of 8.9%, 10%, 8.7%, 6%, and 1.7% of the overall asthma population, 
respectively for Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Italy, and Spain (Engelkes et al 2015). A 
systematic literature review (Chen et al 2018) reported the prevalence of severe uncontrolled 
asthma as between 8% to 87.4% of severe asthma patients. The wide variation was due to 
differences in definition of severe uncontrolled asthma across available studies, as well as 
variability in reporting methods across geographic regions (Chen et al 2018). A study in the 
Netherlands estimated 3.7% of the overall asthma patients had severe asthma, which was 
based on patients requiring GINA step 4 or 5 treatment, having poor symptom control but 
good adherence and inhaler technique (Hekking et al 2015). Furthermore, in 3 database 
analyses, the prevalence of severe uncontrolled disease among the overall asthma patient 
population was 1.6% in France, 2.7% in Italy, and 1.8% in Spain (Godard et al 2010, Allegra 
et al 2012, Quirce et al 2011). A more recent study using the primary care database in the UK 
showed that of the total asthma population, 31% of patients are classified as GINA step 4 or 5 
and 2.9% as GINA step 5 (Kerkhof et al 2018).
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
The European Network for Understanding Mechanisms of Severe Asthma (ENFUMOSA) 
reported a higher proportion of females and higher body mass index in patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma than those with mild to moderate asthma; there was a similar age 
distribution in severe uncontrolled asthma patients and controlled asthma patients (mean age 
42.4 years [standard deviation (SD) 12.1] and 40.9 years [SD 14.3], respectively) and the 
mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) among the severe 
uncontrolled asthma patients was 71.8% (ENFUMOSA 2003). The International Severe 
Asthma Registry (ISAR), which characterised severe asthma worldwide, including the UK 
and Italy, reported that patients were predominantly female (59.3%), white (72.6%), had never 
smoked (60.5%), were overweight or obese (70.4%), were aged 55 to 79 years (52.1%) with a 
mean age at asthma onset of 30.7 (SD 17.7) years, 57.2% had poorly controlled disease and 
34.9% were GINA Step 5 (Wang et al 2020). These demographics are similar to the European 
National Health and Wellness Survey, among severe uncontrolled asthma patients from UK, 
10 (57)
EU RMP

Version: 2
Germany, France, Italy, and Spain (Demoly et al 2009), which reported that patients were 
predominately female (62.6%), had a mean age of 44.5 years, never smoked (66.1%), and 
were overweight or obese (62.8%).
Factors that influence the risk of asthma, including severe presentations, are divided by GINA 
into factors that cause development of the disease (mainly host factors, such as genetic 
predisposition) and factors that trigger symptoms (environmental factors, such as allergens). 
Risk factors for flare-ups (exacerbations), as outlined in the GINA 2020 report, include 
uncontrolled asthma symptoms, inadequate ICS treatment (either not prescribed, poor 
adherence, or incorrect inhaler technique), low FEV1, exposures to smoking and allergens, 
sputum or blood eosinophilia, pregnancy, intubation or in an intensive care unit for asthma, 
and history of exacerbation (GINA 2020).
The main existing treatment options:
Current treatment strategies for controlling asthma are primarily aimed at reducing airway 
inflammation, with ICS being the mainstay of treatment for patients with persistent asthma 
due to their powerful anti-inflammatory effects (GINA 2020, NAEPP 2007). GINA guidelines 
for patients with severe asthma recommend the following:
 Medium-dose ICS-LABA maintenance therapy (or high-dose ICS plus add-on tiotropium 
or leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA]) plus as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol for 
adults and adolescents (Step 4 treatment).
 High-dose ICS-LABA maintenance therapy plus as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol and 
refer for phenotypic assessment and possible treatment with tiotropium, anti-
immunoglobulin E (IgE), anti-interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5 receptor (IL-5R), anti-IL-4 receptor 
(IL-4R), and/or low-dose oral corticosteroids (OCS) as add-on therapy (Step 5 treatment).
Many asthmatic patients remain symptomatic despite treatment with ICS and LABA 
combinations (Rabe et al 2004). Treatment options then include the addition of other 
controller therapies including an LTRA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, theophylline, and 
OCS.
Biologic therapies can provide additional asthma control for patients with severe, uncontrolled 
asthma, and those targeting IgE, IL-4, and IL-5 are now included in international treatment 
guidelines (GINA 2020) as an add-on treatment to patients uncontrolled with ICS/LABA 
treatment. Omalizumab may be suitable for a subgroup of patients with proven reactivity to an 
aeroallergen and elevated serum IgE levels who remain inadequately controlled with ICS plus 
LABA (XOLAIR SmPC). Four additional biologics, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, 
and dupilumab, have been approved for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype and/or 
those requiring OCS therapy (NUCALA SmPC, CINQAERO SmPC, FASENRA SmPC, 
DUPIXENT SmPC). In addition, dupilumab has been approved in the European Union (EU) 
for severe asthma with T2 inflammation as characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or 
11 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
raised FeNO (DUPIXENT SmPC). However, based on the real-world observational study 
CHRONICLE (Ambrose et al 2020), it is estimated that 37% of patients with severe asthma 
have an inadequate response to, or are ineligible for currently approved biologics, and 
continue to experience exacerbations (Soong et al 2020).
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Asthma is characterised by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, variable symptoms of wheezing, 
breathlessness, chest tightness and cough, and by variable expiratory airflow limitation. 
Asthma may also be characterised by exacerbations, which are episodes of worsening 
symptoms and lung function.
Patients with severe refractory asthma constitute approximately 5 to 10% of all asthma 
patients. As part of the severe refractory definition, these patients need at least 3 steroid bursts 
per year (Wenzel 2005). Approximately 30% of severe refractory asthma patients are 
OCS-dependent (Sullivan et al 2018).
Severe, uncontrolled disease is associated with a consistently greater clinical and patient 
burden than in patients with non-severe asthma, consuming the majority of asthma-related 
healthcare resources (Price et al 2014, Israel and Reddel 2017). Severe, uncontrolled asthma 
can lead to a dependence on OCS with systemic corticosteroid exposure potentially leading to 
serious short- and long-term adverse effects (Manson et al 2009, Price et al 2014). In one US 
observational study, patients with severe uncontrolled asthma had a substantially higher 
likelihood of having an emergency room (ER) visit (relative risk = 2.75) or asthma 
hospitalisation (relative risk = 4.54) compared with patients with asthma that was not severe 
and uncontrolled (Zeiger et al 2016). Although overall prevalence data regarding 
exacerbations resulting in hospitalisation or ER visits are variable across Europe, data from 
the UK, Italy, France, and Spain also show a 2- to 5-fold increase in rates of hospitalisation or 
ER visits among patients with moderate or severe asthma compared with those with milder 
asthma (Kerkhof et al 2018, Van Ganse et al 2006, Doz et al 2013).
It is estimated that asthma causes 495000 deaths worldwide every year (GINA 2020). 
Reported case fatality rates vary significantly, possibly due to differences in management.  
Engelkes et al conducted a multinational, database cohort study to assess all-cause mortality 
rate in the Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Italy, and Spain (Engelkes et al 2020). The study 
showed that age and sex standardised all-cause mortality rates ranged from 11.3 to 14.8 per 
1000 PY in severe asthma patients (Engelkes et al 2020). The risk of respiratory-related 
mortality is approximately 8-times greater in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma 
compared with severe controlled asthma patients (Fernandes et al 2014).

Important comorbidities: 
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
Concomitant allergies are commonly reported underlying conditions associated with the 
development of asthma; thus, the clinical presentation of asthma often includes seasonal 
exacerbations or exacerbations related to exposures to recognised allergens, including 
perennial aeroallergens, and environmental airborne irritants. Allergic rhinitis or other allergic 
disease, and eczema have also been identified as risk factors for the subsequent development 
of asthma, particularly in younger patients (Buelo et al 2018). Smoking does not cause 
asthma, but chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma may coexist in 
smoking asthmatics; the 2 diseases may sometimes be difficult to distinguish.
The following are often quoted as comorbid diseases in asthma: chronic sinusitis/rhinitis, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, sleep apnoea, chronic or recurrent respiratory infections, and 
obesity. Psychological disturbances, such as depression and anxiety, are also more frequently 
reported in patients with asthma as compared with the general population (GINA 2020).
The International Severe Asthma Registry provides a more complete assessment of comorbid 
conditions most often seen in severe asthma. In that registry, which assessed 4990 patients 
with severe asthma in 7 countries, allergic rhinitis (49.4%) was the predominant comorbidity 
among severe asthma patients, followed by chronic rhinosinusitis (21.4%), eczema (9.6%), 
and nasal polyps (7.3%) (Wang et al 2020). Similar comorbidities including eczema and/or 
allergic rhinitis (range 11.5% to 37.8%), chronic rhinosinusitis (0.9% to 14.1%), and nasal 
polyps (1.0% to 6.8%) were reported among approximately 43000 severe asthma patents in 
Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Italy, and Spain during the study period 2008 to 2013 (Engelkes 
et al 2020). An Italian registry of 493 severe uncontrolled asthma patients assessed during 
2011 to 2014, reported the most common comorbidities as allergic rhinitis (62.4%), 
gastroesophageal reflux (42.1%), sinusitis (37.9%), nasal polyps (30.2%), and allergic 
conjunctivitis (30.2%) (Maio et al 2018). Another source of information on comorbidities 
amongst patients with severe uncontrolled asthma is from a study in the UK of 2940 patients 
with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma based on medical record data from 1989 to 2015 
(Kerkhof et al 2018). This study found the following comorbidities: eczema (34.0%), allergic 
rhinitis (20.7%), chronic sinusitis (15.5%), nasal polyps (12.8%), gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease (17.5%), and cardiovascular disease (37.7%).
As asthma patients age, the comorbid diseases commonly seen in an aging population may 
impact asthma treatment, such as cardiovascular disease including hypertension or 
ophthalmologic conditions. These diseases may require treatment with β-blockers which are 
contraindicated in asthma (Bateman et al 2008, Salpeter 2003).

MODULE SII: NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
II.2.1
Summary of Key Findings from Nonclinical Data
Toxicity
Cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the nonclinical toxicology species because 
tezepelumab binds to human and cynomolgus monkey thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) 
with picomolar affinity, and neutralised human and cynomolgus monkey TSLP with sub 
nanomolar potency in a cell-based functional bioassay. Tezepelumab did not cross-react with 
mouse, rat, or rabbit TSLP. The species specificity of tezepelumab precluded direct evaluation 
of carcinogenicity.
Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies
Acute toxicity studies: No tezepelumab acute toxicology studies were conducted. In a single-
dose safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 109453), no adverse effects 
were observed after a 300 mg/kg intravenous (IV) administration (a toxicologically relevant 
dose level).
Repeat-dose toxicity studies: In all nonclinical studies, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was the highest dose tested (up to 300 mg/kg) for each route of administration (IV 
and subcutaneous [SC]) in each repeat-dose study. Findings were limited to 
minimally-to-mildly decreased serum cholesterol at the 300 mg/kg dose level in most repeat-
dose studies. The reversibility of the effect on serum cholesterol was confirmed during the 
recovery phases.
In a 3-month repeat-dose study (Study 108448), the T-cell dependent antibody response was 
evaluated by measuring the antibody response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Mean 
anti-KLH immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were mildly-to-moderately decreased at 300 mg/kg. 
At 50 and 100 mg/kg, IgG titers were sporadically reduced but the changes were not 
statistically significant. Reduced anti-KLH IgG antibody titers may be related to the 
pharmacology of tezepelumab, even though not considered adverse since no changes related 
to infection were observed in the study. Similar changes in KLH titers were not evident in 
offspring in a subsequent cynomolgus enhanced pre- and postnatal development (ePPND) 
study.
Reproductive/developmental toxicity
Reproductive toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys: 
Fertility parameters were evaluated in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys in the 6-month 
IV and SC toxicity study (Study 108824). No adverse tezepelumab-related effects on menses

or semen analyses (sperm morphology, motility, or count) were observed. Reproductive organ 
weights (epididymides, ovaries, prostate, testes, and uterus), and macroscopic and microscopic 
pathology of reproductive tissues (testes, prostate, epididymides, seminal vesicles, ovaries, 
uterus, cervix, and vagina) were not impacted by tezepelumab administration. These findings 
suggest that that the reproductive risks associated with tezepelumab administration are low.
In a maternal, embryo-foetal, and neonatal toxicity study, tezepelumab was administered IV to 
pregnant female cynomolgus monkeys at 0, 50, or 300 mg/kg from approximately gestation 
Day 20 until parturition. The infants were studied until 6.5 months post-birth. There were no 
tezepelumab-related effects (maternal, foetal, or infant) up to 300 mg/kg. For all infants 
evaluated during the 6.5-month postnatal period, there were no tezepelumab-related changes 
in clinical signs, body weight, infant measurements, neurobehavioral assessment, 
haematologic parameters, peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotypes, anti-KLH 
humoral immune responses, or external, visceral, or skeletal evaluations. The NOAEL for this 
study was 300 mg/kg.
Genotoxicity
Tezepelumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) composed entirely of naturally occurring 
amino acids and contains no inorganic or synthetic organic linkers or other non-protein 
portions. Thus, it is highly unlikely that tezepelumab would react directly with 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or other chromosomal material, and since tezepelumab is a 
large protein molecule, it is not expected to cross the nuclear or mitochondrial membranes. 
According to the current guidelines on the nonclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-
derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6 R1 2011), the range and type of standard studies evaluating 
genotoxicity routinely conducted for pharmaceuticals are not applicable for biotechnology-
derived pharmaceuticals such as tezepelumab. Based on consideration of the product attributes 
and pharmaceutical class to which tezepelumab belongs, genotoxic risks associated with 
tezepelumab administration are low.
Carcinogenicity
An assessment of the carcinogenic risk associated with long-term inhibition of TSLP was 
completed using a weight-of-evidence approach, as outlined in ICH S6 (R1). This strategy 
involved a thorough review of nonclinical and clinical data generated with tezepelumab, as 
well as literature data related to TSLP mechanism of action and biology. TSLP literature data 
(ie, information on class effects, knockout mouse models, and human genetic mutations) did 
not indicate a potential carcinogenic concern associated with long-term tezepelumab 
treatment. Due to the evidence linking TSLP overexpression to the promotion of tumour 
growth and metastasis (Barooei et al 2015, Watanabe et al 2015, Xie et al 2015, Lo Kuan and 
Ziegler 2014) in both animal models and in human translational studies, inhibition of TSLP 
such as with tezepelumab may provide anti-tumour activity rather than increased cancer risk.
15 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
No evidence of proliferative or pre-neoplastic changes was observed in toxicology studies 
following repeated weekly administration of tezepelumab at doses up to 50 mg/kg IV or 
300 mg/kg SC for 26 weeks.
In summary, following a thorough review of available data from literature, nonclinical and 
clinical studies, it is considered that chronic inhibition of TSLP would not increase the 
lifetime risk of cancer. A 2-year rodent bioassay with the clinical candidate is not possible due 
to lack of cross-reactivity to the target in rodents. It is considered that the available 
weight-of-evidence information regarding TSLP biology, gene deficient mice, and human 
genetic diseases, as well as the completed tezepelumab nonclinical safety studies, provide an 
adequate assessment of the nonclinical carcinogenic potential of chronic TSLP blockade.
Safety pharmacology 
Effects of tezepelumab on cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurobehavioral endpoints were 
evaluated in a single-dose safety pharmacology study in telemetered cynomolgus monkeys 
(Study 109453). There were no treatment-related effects on cardiovascular function, 
respiratory rate, neurological behavior, and body temperature after a single 300 mg/kg IV 
tezepelumab administration.
II.3
MODULE SIII: CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
The clinical trial exposure to tezepelumab is summarised for the Primary Safety Pool and the 
Exposure Pool.
The Primary Safety Pool consists of pooled data from the confirmatory asthma exacerbation 
studies D5180C00007 (Phase 3) and CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146 (Phase 2b). These studies had a 
similar design, similar inclusion/exclusion criteria, the same safety endpoints, and compatible 
frequency and timing of safety assessments. This pool provides the primary data to support the 
evaluation of the safety profile of tezepelumab 210 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) SC dose in 
subjects with severe uncontrolled asthma and to support the evaluation of risks presented in 
this Risk Management Plan (RMP) in Section II.7.
The Exposure Pool consists of pooled data from all 5 of the tezepelumab Phase 2 and 3 
asthma studies. This pool comprises 4 studies in subjects with severe asthma (D5180C00007, 
CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146, D5180C00009 [a Phase 3, OCS-reduction study], and 
D5180C00011 [a Phase 3, device functionality study]), and 1 study in subjects with moderate 
to severe asthma (D5180C00013 [a Phase 2 mechanistic study]). This pool provides a broader 
view of the extent of subject exposure to tezepelumab in the Phase 2/3 clinical programme 
including exposure data for 4 tezepelumab treatment groups: 70 mg Q4W SC, 210 mg Q4W 
SC, 280 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) SC, and tezepelumab ‘all doses’ combined group.

Although 2 Phase 1 studies (Study 20101183 and D5180C00002) included subjects with 
asthma, these studies were not included in the Exposure Pool. Study 20101183 was a multiple 
dose study of tezepelumab 700 mg administered intravenously in adults with mild atopic 
asthma. Study D5180C00002 was a single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study of tezepelumab 
140 mg administered SC in adolescents with mild to moderate asthma. Both studies were 
excluded from the pooling as they were conducted in study subjects with milder disease than 
those in the pooled studies, and the dosing regimen and/or method of administration was not 
in-line with the proposed 210 mg administered SC Q4W.
The duration of exposure, exposure by age group and sex, exposure by dose, and exposure by 
ethnic/racial origin for tezepelumab based on the Primary Safety Pool and the Exposure Pool

MODULE SIV: POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Programme
Known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the drug formulation
Reason for exclusion: Patients with a known allergy or reaction to any component of the drug 
formulation were excluded from clinical studies for safety reasons to ensure they were not 
exposed to product to which they had a documented allergy/reaction.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Tezepelumab is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to 
tezepelumab or any of its excipients; therefore, this population is not relevant as missing 
information.
Patients with a history of cancer
Reason for exclusion: Specific exclusions applied to patients with a history of certain types of 
malignancy to ensure that the medical conditions or concomitant therapy for the condition did 
not confound the assessment of safety of tezepelumab. Patients who have had basal cell 
carcinoma, localised squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix 
were eligible to enter tezepelumab clinical studies provided that the patient was in remission 
and curative therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to entry into the study. Patients 
who have had other malignancies were eligible provided that the patient was in remission and 
curative therapy was completed at least 5 years prior to entry into the study.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There are no data to suggest that the safety profile for tezepelumab in patients with 
a history of cancer will be different than that of the general target population. Hence, use of 
tezepelumab in patients with a history of cancer is not considered to be missing information. 
Presence of active helminth parasitic infection
Reason for exclusion: Tezepelumab has potential inhibitory effects on immune responses 
mediated by T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cells through blockade of TSLP and may decrease the 
host’s protective response to helminth infection. Theoretically, this may cause a worsening of 
parasitic infection by interfering with the expulsion of helminthic parasites. Therefore, 
patients with a helminth parasite infection diagnosed within 6 months prior to Visit 1 that was 
not treated with, or had failed to respond to, standard of care therapy were excluded from 
clinical studies and those at high risk of infection were monitored during the studies for these 
infections per local medical practice.
20 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale:
There is a theoretical potential risk that use of tezepelumab in this population could cause a 
worsening of an existing parasitic infection but there have been no confirmed cases of 
helminth infection reported in the clinical study programme to date. Should a helminth 
infection occur, prescribers are aware of the possible risk, which can be managed through 
routine clinical practice. Section 4.4 of the SmPC advises that patients should be treated for 
pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with tezepelumab, therefore it is 
anticipated that use in this population will be limited. Given that exposure in this population is 
unlikely and there is insufficient evidence of a different safety profile in this population, 
patients with active helminth infection are not considered relevant for inclusion as missing 
information.
Receipt of live attenuated vaccines
Reason for exclusion: Patients were excluded from clinical studies if they had received any 
live attenuated vaccines within a short period of time (15 or 30 days) prior to the date of 
randomisation and were not permitted to receive such vaccines during the clinical study 
conduct. Patients were excluded in order to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the safety and efficacy data of tezepelumab and ensure interpretability of 
data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: For some biologics, including those for rheumatologic disease (ACR 2015), there is 
a theoretical concern that disseminated viral shedding and infection can occur when live 
attenuated vaccines are given concomitantly with biologic use. Consequently, Section 4.5 of 
the proposed SmPC advises that use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients 
who are receiving tezepelumab. Given that exposure is in this population is unlikely, receipt 
of live attenuated vaccines is not considered relevant for inclusion as missing information.
Receipt of inactivated vaccines
Reason for exclusion/restriction: Receipt of inactivated vaccines was allowed in the 5 Phase 2 
and 3 studies. In 4 of the studies (D5180C00007, D5180C00009, D5180C00011, and 
D5180C00013), receipt of inactivated vaccines was allowed provided they were not 
administered within 5 days before or after any study visit/investigational product (IP) 
administration. This restriction was applied in order to avoid factors that may confound a 
complete understanding of the safety and efficacy data of tezepelumab, and to ensure 
interpretability of data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
21 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
Rationale: For those patients who received inactivated vaccines during clinical studies there is 
no apparent evidence of a different safety profile compared with those who did not receive 
vaccination.
Patients with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening or 
patients taking antiretroviral medications; patients with medical history of hepatitis B, 
hepatitis C, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, or hepatitis C virus antibody serology
Reason for exclusion: Patients with positive HIV test, those taking antiretroviral medications, 
those with medical history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, or 
those with hepatitis C virus antibody serology were excluded from clinical studies to ensure 
that the study safety results were not confounded by the presence of pre-existing illnesses and 
to mitigate for a theoretical concern related to potential viral activation/re-activation.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There is no reason to suggest that the safety profile of tezepelumab when 
administered to patients with positive HIV test or those taking antiretroviral medications or 
those with medical history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, or 
hepatitis C virus antibody serology will differ from that characterised so far in the general 
target population. Clinical data from studies in the Primary Safety Pool (D5180C00007 and 
CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146) and from Study D5180C00009 indicate that antibody production in 
terms of IgA, IgG and IgM appears to be intact in patients treated with tezepelumab, thus no 
potential viral activation/re-activation in patients exposed to tezepelumab is expected.
Active liver disease, including jaundice or alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase level ≥ 2.0 times the upper limit of normal
Reason for exclusion: To ensure patient safety during their participation in the study and to 
ensure the study results, specifically liver findings, were not confounded by pre-existing 
illnesses.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via the hepatic pathway, thus 
change in hepatic function is not expected to influence tezepelumab clearance. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, baseline hepatic function biomarkers (ALT, AST, and 
total bilirubin) had no clinically relevant effect on tezepelumab clearance. For this reason, it is 
not anticipated that the safety profile will be different in patients with active liver disease 
compared with that characterised so far in the general target population.

Paediatric patients aged less than 12 years
Reason for exclusion: Paediatric patients less than 12 years old will not be exposed to the 
investigational product until after the benefit-risk profile is established for the intended adult 
and adolescent population. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Tezepelumab is not indicated in paediatric patients <12 years old, therefore this 
population is not relevant for missing information.
Elderly patients aged greater than 80 years
Reason for exclusion: Comorbid conditions may put elderly people at increased risk and may 
confound assessment of safety. Thus, this vulnerable population was excluded in all 
tezepelumab clinical studies.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Patients greater than 80 years old represent a small proportion of the population of 
adults with severe asthma; in the ISAR (described in Section II.1) of approximately 5000 
patients, only 4.2% of were ≥ 80 years old, whereas 43.6% of subjects were 18 to 54 years 
old, and 52.1% of subjects were 55 to 79 years old [Wang et al 2020]. Thus, expected 
exposure of patients greater than 80 years old to tezepelumab for treatment of asthma in 
marketed use is expected to be limited.
In the Primary Safety Pool (age range 12 to 80 years old), a total 119 out of 665 (17.9%) 
subjects who received tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W were ≥ 65 years old (Table II-2). The 
safety profile of tezepelumab in asthma patients ≥ 65 years old was similar to that in asthma 
patients ≥ 18 to <65 years old and differences in tezepelumab PK exposures between age 
groups were small relative to the overall variability of exposures. Consequently, there is no 
scientific evidence to anticipate a different safety profile for tezepelumab in patients > 80 
years old than that in the general target population and further characterisation in this 
population is thus not considered feasible or warranted. Therefore, this population is not 
relevant for missing information.
Pregnancy or lactation
Reason for exclusion: In order to ensure the safety of this patient population during the 
development phase of the medicinal product, these patients were excluded.

of the patient throughout the study or influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations or impede 
the patient’s ability to complete the entire duration of study’.
The renal and cardiovascular impairment categories were based on searches of the Primary Safety Pool 
subject population baseline medical history MedDRA 23.1 preferred terms. The search strategy for renal 
impairment included the Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) of chronic kidney disease. The search 
strategy for cardiovascular impairment included SMQ (narrow) cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure,

MODULE SV: POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE
II.5.1
Method used to calculate exposure
The post-marketing patient exposure data presented here is based on tezepelumab’s monthly 
actual ex-factory sales volume from each local affiliate. These data represent all tezepelumab 
formulation delivered to various distribution channels (e.g., wholesalers, pharmacies, etc) 
worldwide.
24 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
The sales volume is provided as the number of units distributed as of 31 August 2022. The 
estimated post-marketing patient exposure data is an approximation based on the assumption 
that each patient took 1 unit (210 mg/1.91mL) of tezepelumab every 4 weeks and 13 units in 
total per year (52 weeks). Therefore, a patient-year worth of exposure is calculated by 
dividing number of units by 13 (13 units of 210 mg/1.91mL tezepelumab per patient year).
The current methodology does not distinguish between sales that are related to initial 
prescriptions versus those related to repeat prescriptions. Therefore, it is not possible to
estimate the number of patients exposed to tezepelumab. More detailed patient-level data (eg, 
gender, ethnicity, age category, off-label use, specific populations etc) are not available.
II.5.2
Exposure
Cumulative global post-marketing patient exposure for tezepelumab (210◦mg/1.91mL) was 
estimated to be approximately 1774 patient-years, representing 100% of the exposure since 
launch (17 December 2021) to 31 August 2022. Approximately 0.12% of the worldwide 
distribution was in the European region and 99.88% was in the North American region.

Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission
II.7.1.1
Risk Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP
Reasons for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers 
(eg, actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the 
product is authorised):

Serious hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions are 
well-known reactions that can occur with protein-based therapies. In the Primary Safety 
Pool, the incidence of serious hypersensitivity reactions was low and similar in the 
tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups (0.2% of subjects and 0.3% of subjects, 
respectively); none were considered related to IP by the investigator. In the Primary 
Safety Pool and the wider clinical study programme, there were no events of anaphylaxis 
that the investigator considered to be causally related to tezepelumab. These reactions are 
managed as per routine clinical practice and product labelling (see Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC).
 Helminth infections: Tezepelumab has potential inhibitory effects on immune responses 
mediated by Th2 cells through blockade of TSLP and may decrease the host’s protective 
response to helminth infection. There is a potential theoretical risk that use of 
tezepelumab could cause a worsening of an existing parasitic infection, however, there 
have been no confirmed cases of helminth infection reported in the clinical study 
programme to date. Helminth infections are usually nonserious and, should a helminth 
infection occur, prescribers will be aware of the possible risk which can be managed 
through routine clinical practice. Section 4.4 of the SmPC advises that patients with a pre-
existing helminth infection should be treated before initiating therapy with tezepelumab,
and that if patients become infected while receiving treatment with tezepelumab and do 
not respond to anti-helminth treatment, treatment with tezepelumab is to be discontinued 
until the infection resolves.
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile:
 Arthralgia
Pharyngitis

Injection Site Reactions

Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
Important Identified Risks
There are no important identified risks for tezepelumab.
Important Potential Risk: Serious Infections
Risk Benefit Impact
The mechanism of action of tezepelumab suggests potential inhibitory effects on immune 
responses mediated by Th2 cells, leading to the possibility of diminution of the host’s 
protective response to infection. Given the potential theoretical risk, serious infections are 
included as an important potential risk.
Medically significant, serious infections have the potential to result in serious consequences 
such as hospitalisation, fatality, or a detrimental impact on patient’s quality of life. Serious 
infection, if confirmed to be causally related, would impact the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Important Potential Risk: Serious Cardiac Events
Risk Benefit Impact
There is no known mechanism by which blocking TSLP would lead to cardiac 
pathophysiology. However, a numeric imbalance in Cardiac Disorder SOC SAEs was 
observed in the long-term clinical study D5180C00018 (described in Section II.7.3.1), 
therefore, serious cardiac events are included as an important potential risk.
Serious cardiac events have the potential to result in serious consequences such as 
hospitalisation, loss of physical capacity due to persisting symptoms, fatality, or a detrimental 
impact on patient’s quality of life. Serious cardiac events, if confirmed to be causally related, 
would impact the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Important Potential Risk: Malignancy
Risk Benefit Impact 
As described in Section II.2.1, there is some evidence from different animal models and in 
human translational studies linking TSLP over-expression to the promotion of tumour growth 
and metastasis (reviewed also by Protti and De Monte 2020 and Corren and Ziegler 2019), 
which would suggest that inhibition of TSLP would be more likely to have anti-tumour 
activity than be associated with increased cancer risk. However, given the long-term treatment 
intended for a chronic disease and the nature of malignancy development, malignancy is 
included as an important potential risk.

Malignancies have the potential to result in serious consequences such as hospitalisation, 
fatality, or a detrimental impact on patient’s quality of life. Malignancies, if confirmed to be 
causally related, would impact the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Missing Information: Use in pregnant and breastfeeding women
Severe asthma affects women of childbearing potential age; thus, it is important to further 
evaluate the impact of tezepelumab in pregnant or breastfeeding women as exposure is 
anticipated and tezepelumab is not contraindicated in this population.
Risk-Benefit Impact
Nonclinical data conclude that reproductive risks associated with tezepelumab administration 
are low. Human IgG antibodies, such as tezepelumab, are transported across the placenta 
barrier, therefore, tezepelumab may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. 
It is unknown whether tezepelumab is excreted in human milk, however, IgG antibodies are 
known to be present in human milk. Consequently, the possibility of harm to the foetus and 
breastfed infant cannot be excluded. The use of tezepelumab in pregnancy will be evaluated in 
the post-marketing setting through a non-interventional pregnancy study (Section III.2.1).
Missing Information: Long-term use (> 1 year)
Limited information is available on the long-term use (greater than 1 year) of tezepelumab 
210 mg SC. In completed Phase 2 and 3 studies, subjects with severe asthma received 
tezepelumab for up to 52 weeks (refer to details in Section II.7.3.2). In the proposed marketed 
use, exposure to tezepelumab treatment for > 1 year is expected.
Risk-Benefit Impact
In order to provide data on the long-term effects of tezepelumab, a long-term extension study 
(D5180C00018) is currently ongoing (refer also to Table III-1). This study includes patients 
previously treated in Studies D5180C00007 and D5180C00009 and will further characterise 
the long-term safety profile of tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W for up to a total of 104 weeks of 
treatment. Summary exposure data as of the primary database lock for this study (9 December 
2021) are provided in Section II.7.3.2. The final database lock for this study is planned for 
July 2022.

Important Identified Risk:
Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks
There are no important identified risks for tezepelumab.
Important Potential Risk: Serious Infections
Potential Mechanisms
The mechanism of action of tezepelumab suggests potential inhibitory effects on immune 
responses mediated by Th2 cells, leading to the possibility of diminution of the host’s 
protective response to infection.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
There is a theoretical risk of infection based on the mechanism of action of tezepelumab, 
however there were no imbalances in the incidence of serious infections observed in the 
tezepelumab and placebo groups in the Primary Safety Pool or the long-term extension study 
D5180C00018. 
In addition, nonclinical data do not suggest a potential impact of tezepelumab treatment on 
immune responses and no increase in infection was observed in treated animals. A 
relationship of inhibitory effects on immune responses mediated by Th2 cells and serious 
infection or infection overall has not been established with tezepelumab.
Characterisation of the risk
Clinical trial data from the Primary Safety Pool show that the incidence of subjects with SAEs 
reported in the Infections and infestations SOC was similar in the tezepelumab and placebo 
groups (13/665 subjects [2.0%] versus 15 /669 subjects [2.2%], respectively; 2.02 versus 2.35 
per 100 subjects-years, respectively); of these SAEs, 2 events were considered causally related 
to IP by the investigator (1 subject for each event): upper respiratory tract infection 
(tezepelumab group [0.2%]) and lung abscess (placebo group [0.1%]).
Pooled data from Study D5180C00018 show that the incidence of subjects with SAEs 
reported in the infections and infestations SOC was similar in the tezepelumab and placebo 
groups (28/840 subjects in the All Teze group [ie, all subjects originally randomised to 
tezepelumab in the predecessor studies, D5180C00007 and D5180C00009, and randomised to 
tezepelumab in Study D5180C00018], versus 19/607 subjects in the Rand Pbo group [ie, all 
subjects randomised to placebo in the predecessor studies regardless of participation in 
D5180C00018, and excluding data post re-randomisation to tezepelumab in the extension

Version: 2
period for subjects that participated in D5180C00018], incidence rates per 100 subject-years 
of 2.18 versus 2.38, respectively). No apparent trends in serious infections were noted.
Very few fatal infection events were observed across the tezepelumab asthma programme, and 
the incidence of AEs of infection and SAEs of infection is similar across treatment groups. 
There were 5 fatal infections overall in Study D5180C00018 (4/840 subjects in the All Teze 
group versus 1/607 subject in the Rand Pbo group; 0.29 versus 0.12 per 100 subject-years, 
respectively), with no other fatal infections reported in the rest of the completed studies in the 
tezepelumab asthma programme. None of the fatal infection events were considered to be 
causally associated by the Investigator or the Sponsor and all were considered by the blinded 
Independent Adjudication Committee to be unlikely to be related to IP (none were considered 
to have certain or probable/likely causality).
Risk factors and risk groups
No specific risk factors or subgroups of patients have been identified in respect of increased 
potential risk of infection with tezepelumab.
Preventability
As per standard medical practice, patients should be encouraged to seek medical advice if 
signs or symptoms suggestive of any infection occur in order to receive early medical 
treatment (eg, oral antibiotics, etc) before an infection becomes serious. If infection occurs, 
close monitoring and early intervention can mitigate the impact. 
As noted in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, patients with pre-existing serious infections should be 
treated before initiating therapy with tezepelumab. If patients develop a serious infection 
while receiving tezepelumab treatment and do not respond to treatment, therapy with 
tezepelumab should be discontinued until the serious infection resolves.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Medically significant, serious infections have the potential to result in serious consequences 
such as hospitalisation, fatality, or a detrimental impact on patient’s quality of life. Serious 
infection, if confirmed to be causally related, would impact the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Further characterisation of this potential risk through pharmacovigilance activities (as 
described in Sections III.2 and III.3) will provide a better understanding of this risk and 
further define potential impact on the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Public health impact

EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
As the potential impact is to the treated population of patients with severe asthma only, there 
is no public health impact.
Important Potential Risk: Serious Cardiac Events
Potential Mechanisms
There is no known mechanism by which blocking TSLP would lead to cardiac 
pathophysiology. Little or no expression of TSLP and TSLPR is detected in human cardiac 
tissue (Uhlén et al 2015). Studies using TSLPR deficient or knockout mice have shown no 
adverse CV findings (Al-Shami et al 2005, Carpino et al 2004). While there are multiple 
adaptive and innate pathways where TSLP activity, or the blocking of TSLPR, may influence 
inflammation and inflammatory mediators; mechanisms specific to the human cardiovascular 
system have not been identified.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
A numeric imbalance in Cardiac Disorder SOC SAEs was observed in Study D5180C00018, 
however, there were no imbalances in overall cardiac SOC events in the Primary Safety Pool 
or the long-term extension study D5180C00018.
No cardiac safety signals were identified in the tezepelumab safety pharmacology study, 
nonclinical toxicology studies, or tissue cross-reactivity study with human and cynomolgus 
monkey tissues. These studies tested tezepelumab dose levels that resulted in safety margins 
of greater than 100-fold on an AUC and Cmax basis to the maximum recommended human 
dose of a subcutaneous 210 mg dose, every four weeks.
Characterisation of the risk
In the Primary Safety Pool no imbalance in the incidence of overall Cardiac Disorder SOC 
events (serious and nonserious combined) was observed for tezepelumab and placebo 
treatment groups (20/665 [3.0%] subjects, incidence rate 3.11 per 100 subject years versus 
19/669 [2.8%] subjects, incidence rate 2.98 per 100 subject-years, respectively). In Study 
D5180C00018, there was no imbalance in the incidence of overall AEs in the Cardiac 
Disorders SOC (serious and nonserious combined) observed for tezepelumab and placebo 
groups (40/840 subjects, 3.12 per 100 subject-years in the All Teze group versus 22/607 
subjects, incidence rate of 2.75 per 100 subject-years in the Rand Pbo group).
In the Primary Safety Pool, the incidence of Cardiac Disorders SOC SAEs was low in the 
tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups (5/665 subjects, incidence rate 0.78 per 100 
subject-years versus 2/669 subjects, incidence rate of 0.31 per 100 subject-years, 
respectively). However, in Study D5180C00018, an imbalance in rates of Cardiac Disorders 
SAEs between treatment groups was apparent at the grouped SOC level and not at the 
31 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
individual PT level (17/840 subjects, incidence rate of 1.33 per 100 subject-years in the All 
Teze group versus 0/607 subjects, incidence rate of 0.00 per 100 subject-years in the Rand 
Pbo group). It is noted that 4 of the 5 events in the Primary Safety Pool in the tezepelumab 
210 mg group were observed in Study D5180C00007 and are therefore also counted as part of 
the imbalance observed in DESTINATION. Analyses by PTs showed no apparent pattern in 
types or categories of cardiac events and the events were also observed across different HLGT 
categories (ie, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, heart failures, and myocardial 
disorders).
A small number of Cardiac Disorder SOC Fatal AEs have been observed in Study 
D5180C00018 (3/840 subjects in the All Teze group and 1/607 subjects in the Rand Pbo 
group; incidence rates of 0.22 and 0.12 per 100 subject-years, respectively). None of the fatal 
events were considered causally related to IP by the Investigator. All were considered as 
unlikely to be related to IP by the blinded Independent Adjudication Committee. No other 
events of Cardiac Disorder SOC fatal AEs were observed within a broader pool of studies in 
asthma assessing 210 mg Q4W multiple dose.
Risk factors and risk groups
There is no evidence of a specific factor that would increase the risk of fatal cardiac events in 
subjects receiving tezepelumab, and no specific subgroup of patients who may be at an 
increased risk of serious cardiac events has been identified.
Preventability
As noted in SmPC Section 4.4, patients should be advised of signs or symptoms suggestive of 
a cardiac event (for example, chest pain, dyspnoea, malaise, feeling lightheaded or faint) and 
to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Serious cardiac events have the potential to result in serious consequences such as 
hospitalisation, loss of physical capacity due to persisting symptoms, fatality, or a detrimental 
impact on patient’s quality of life. Serious cardiac events, if confirmed to be causally related, 
would impact the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Further characterisation of this potential risk through pharmacovigilance activities (as 
described in Sections III.2 and III.3) will provide a better understanding of this risk and 
further define potential impact on the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.

Potential Mechanisms
As described in Section II.2.1, there is evidence from different animal models and in human 
translational studies linking TSLP over-expression to the promotion of tumour growth and 
metastasis (reviewed also by Protti and De Monte 2020, and Corren and Ziegler 2019), which 
would suggest that inhibition of TSLP would be more likely to have anti-tumour activity than 
be associated with increased cancer risk.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
Malignancies have been reported in the completed asthma studies of tezepelumab. The 
incidence of malignancies reported was low and similar across tezepelumab and placebo 
treatment groups in the Primary Safety Pool and in the long-term study D5180C00018 
including up to 2 years of treatment. However, longer-term exposure data are not available, 
and a potential theoretical risk of malignancy remains.
Data from chronic toxicity studies (summarised in Section II.2.1) did not reveal any product-
specific concerns with tezepelumab regarding malignancy risk.
Characterisation of the risk
In the Primary Safety Pool, a total of 11 subjects reported a malignancy in the on-treatment 
period: 6 subjects (0.9%) in the tezepelumab group and 5 subjects (0.7%) in the placebo 
group. Malignancies in the tezepelumab group included 2 (0.3%) subjects with basal cell 
carcinoma, 2 (0.3%) subjects with malignant melanoma in situ, 2 (0.3%) subjects with 
prostate cancer, and 1 (0.2%) subject with squamous cell carcinoma (2 malignancies were 
reported in one subject). In the long-term study D5180C00018, a total of 12 subjects reported 
a malignancy on treatment, and the incidence of subjects with malignancies was similar in the 
tezepelumab and placebo groups (7/840 subjects in the All Teze group versus 5/607 subjects 
in the Rand Pbo group; incidence rates of 0.55 and 0.63 per 100 subject-years, respectively). 
Malignancies reported in the Rand Teze group were as follows: malignant melanoma in situ (2 
subjects), basal cell carcinoma (1 subject), colon cancer stage IV (1 subject), colorectal cancer 
(1 subject), invasive breast carcinoma (1 subject), prostate cancer (1 subject) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (1 subject).
No apparent trends in malignancies were noted in either the Primary Safety Pool or Study 
D5180C00018 with up to 104 weeks of treatment with tezepelumab.

Risk factors and risk groups
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
No specific risk factors or subgroups of patients have been identified in respect of potential 
malignancy risk for patients treated with tezepelumab.
Preventability
The general risk of malignancy can be reduced by managing lifestyle factors such as smoking, 
alcohol use, and activity levels. There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of 
malignancy for tezepelumab specifically therefore general measures such as early detection 
and managing lifestyle factors are appropriate.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Malignancies have the potential to result in serious consequences such as hospitalisation, 
fatality, or a detrimental impact on patient’s quality of life. Malignancies, if confirmed to be 
causally related, would impact the benefit-risk of tezepelumab.
Further characterisation of this potential risk through pharmacovigilance activities (as 
described in Sections III.2 and III.3) will provide a better understanding of this risk and

No adverse effects on maternal health, pregnancy outcome, embryo-foetal development, or 
neonatal development were observed in a prenatal and postnatal development study conducted 
in cynomolgus monkeys following intravenous tezepelumab administration up to 
300 mg/kg/week from early gestation through delivery. The safety margins from this study 
(calculated using Gestation Day 139-142 exposure prior to parturition) are approximately 
168 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an area under the 
concentration-time curve at steady state basis, and 259 times the MRHD on a maximum 
observed serum concentration at steady state basis.

Version: 2
The exposure data on pregnancy from the clinical studies are limited and therefore insufficient 
to inform on drug-associated risk in this population. Human IgG antibodies, such as 
tezepelumab, are transported across the placenta barrier, therefore, tezepelumab may be 
transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus.
Eleven patients in the confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies reported pregnancies, 4 in 
CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146 (2 in the tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W group and 2 in the tezepelumab 
280 mg Q2W group [all occurred in the on-treatment period]), and 7 in D5180C00007 (3 in 
the tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W group [2 during the on-treatment period] and 4 in the placebo 
group [2 during the on-treatment period]). Seven patients delivered healthy, full term infants. 
One patient in the CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146 tezepelumab 280 mg group delivered pre-term 
twins after experiencing an SAE of pre-eclampsia. One patient in the CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146 
tezepelumab 280 mg group was reported to have a spontaneous abortion at 11 weeks into the 
pregnancy. Two patients in D5180C00007 were reported to have had spontaneous abortions at 
6 and 9 weeks into the pregnancies, respectively, both patients were in the tezepelumab 
210 mg group, of which one became pregnant during the on-treatment period. No additional 
information was provided for the 3 patients who had spontaneous abortions. No pregnancies 
were reported in any of the other completed tezepelumab asthma clinical studies.
As patients were discontinued from IP once their pregnancy was known, there are no data 
relating to patients taking tezepelumab throughout the entirety of their pregnancy, and there 
are no data relating to the effect of tezepelumab on lactating patients or their offspring.
Breastfeeding: In nonclinical species the possibility of transfer from maternal animal to the 
infant via milk could not be excluded. It is unknown whether tezepelumab is excreted in 
human milk. However, IgG antibodies are known to be present in human milk. Therefore, risk 
to the breastfed child cannot be excluded.
In Section 4.6 of the SmPC, it is recommended not to use tezepelumab during pregnancy 
unless the expected benefit to the pregnant mother is greater than any possible risk to the 
foetus. It is also stated that a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or 
to discontinue/abstain from using tezepelumab, taking into account the benefit and risk of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Use of tezepelumab in pregnant women will be studied in a post-marketing secondary data 
collection, observational, 2-stage study using healthcare databases (Section III.2.1).

expected.
In the Primary Safety Pool, where studies included a treatment period of up to 52 weeks, out 
of a total of 665 subjects who received tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W, 615 (92.5%) and 541 
(81.4%) subjects, respectively, received treatment for ≥ 48 weeks and ≥ 52 weeks (Table II-1). 
In the Exposure Pool (all 5 Phase 2 and 3 studies), where the treatment period ranged from 
24 to 52 weeks, out of a total of 1014 subjects who received tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W, 
668 (65.9%) and 541 (53.4%), respectively, received treatment for ≥ 48 weeks and for 
≥ 52 weeks (Table II-1). A Phase 3 clinical study is currently ongoing to characterise the long-
term safety profile of tezepelumab as described below. As of the primary database lock for 
D5180C00018 (9 December 2021), based on pooled exposure data for subjects from both 
predecessor studies, a total of 839 subjects in the All Teze group were exposed to tezepelumab 
with an overall mean duration of exposure of 558.7 days (range: 24 to 796 days). The final 
database lock for this study is planned for July 2022.
Population in need of further characterisation:
The safety and tolerability of tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W SC in long-term use (> 1 year) is 
being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel

III.2.1
Tezepelumab Pregnancy Study
D5180R00010: A Database Study of the Use (and Safety) of Tezepelumab in Women 
with Severe Asthma During Pregnancy
Rationale and study objectives
Tezepelumab is anticipated to be a first in class biologic indicated for the treatment of severe 
asthma based on its mechanism of action. There are risks associated with pregnancy in women 
with severe asthma and there is limited data available in the tezepelumab clinical programme 
on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The prevalence of asthma and severe asthma in 
women of childbearing age, coupled with the chronic nature of treatment, makes inadvertent 
exposure in pregnancy possible. Hence, the safety of tezepelumab in pregnancy is considered 
to be missing information for regulatory requirements.
To fill this important knowledge gap, AstraZeneca proposes to conduct a secondary, 
observational 2-stage study using a healthcare database.
The objectives of the proposed study are the following:


Stage 1: To monitor the use of tezepelumab in pregnant women with severe asthma to 
inform the initiation of Stage 2.
Stage 2:
37 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
 To describe pregnancy and delivery outcomes in pregnancies among women with 
severe asthma exposed to tezepelumab at any time during pregnancy. Outcomes will 
be assessed by trimester of exposure as a secondary objective.
 To compare frequency of outcomes in pregnant women exposed to tezepelumab with 
that in those not exposed to tezepelumab.
Study design:
The proposed study is a secondary data collection, observational, 2-stage study using a 
healthcare database. Once feasibility assessment of data sources has been completed and a 
data source selected 1, and tezepelumab is well established in the respective markets, Stage 1 
will provide data to monitor the use of tezepelumab in pregnant women with severe asthma 
and is designed to inform when would be the best time to initiate Stage 2. The Stage 1 study 
will identify the cohort of pregnant women with severe asthma who were exposed to 
tezepelumab during their pregnancy and have met all the inclusion criteria for the Stage 2 
study. Included patients must have background data available before the index date, which is 
the date of the prescription/dispensing tezepelumab and followed for up to 1 year post-
delivery to assess the pregnancy outcomes.
It is anticipated that with the availability of data from Stage 1, Stage 2 will be a safety 
outcome study that aims to describe pregnancy and delivery outcomes among pregnant 
women with severe asthma who were exposed to tezepelumab during their pregnancy and 
compare its frequency with that of the 2 comparator cohorts: (1) Disease cohort: pregnant 
women with severe asthma who have not been exposed to any biologics; and (2) Non-disease 
cohort: healthy pregnant women with no current diagnosis of asthma and who have not been 
exposed to any asthma medications. Appropriate statistical methods to ensure comparability 
between the cohorts will be used (eg, propensity score matching) and include key known and 
potential confounders. Incidence rate of pregnancy outcomes will be described by study 
groups. The incidence rate ratios will be calculated using appropriate statistical methods to 
ensure comparability between the cohorts.
1 The following are data sources that will be evaluated in the feasibility assessment but are not limited to: 
HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) in the United States (US); Optum Dynamic Assessment of 
Pregnancies and Infants (Optum DAPI) in the US; IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters

Phase 3 Efficacy and Safety Study of Tezepelumab in Reducing OCS 
Use in Adults with OCS Dependent Asthma (D5180C00024)
A Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled, 28-week Phase 3 
Efficacy and Safety Study of Tezepelumab in Reducing Oral Corticosteroid Use in 
Adults with Oral Corticosteroid Dependent Asthma (SUNRISE)
Rationale and study objectives
The purpose of this global study is to demonstrate the ability of tezepelumab, compared with 
placebo, to reduce OCS use in adults with severe asthma being treated with maintenance OCS 
in combination with high dose ICS and LABA, with or without other asthma controller 
therapies, while maintaining asthma control.
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab compared with 
placebo in reducing the prescribed OCS maintenance dose in participants with asthma 
requiring chronic treatment with maintenance OCS in addition to high dose ICS plus LABA 
by assessment of categorised percent reduction from baseline in the daily maintenance OCS 
dose at Week 28 whilst maintaining asthma control. The key secondary objective is to 
evaluate the effect of tezepelumab compared with placebo on pre-bronchodilator lung function 
by evaluation of change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 
1 second (pre-BD FEV1) at Week 28. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of tezepelumab based on assessment of AEs, SAEs, clinical chemistry, haematology and vital 
signs.
Study design
This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W administered SC for 
28 weeks using an accessorised pre-filled syringe, compared with placebo in reducing OCS 
use in OCS-dependent adult asthma participants.

(D5180C00021)
A Regional, Multicentre, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel 
Group, 52-week, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tezepelumab in 
Adults with Severe Uncontrolled Asthma (DIRECTION)
Rationale and study objectives
The purpose of this regional (China/Asia) study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
210 mg dose of tezepelumab administered SC Q4W in adults (18 to 80 years of age inclusive) 
with a history of asthma exacerbations and severe, uncontrolled asthma receiving medium or 
high dose ICS plus at least one additional asthma controller medication with or without OCS. 
The study will evaluate the incidence of asthma exacerbations and other efficacy parameters 
such as lung function, asthma control and quality of life as well as a safety evaluation to 
further characterise the benefit-risk profile of the drug.
The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of 210 mg tezepelumab SC Q4W on 
asthma exacerbations in adult subjects with severe uncontrolled asthma compared with 
placebo by evaluation of the primary outcome measure AAER ratio vs placebo over 52 weeks. 
Key secondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of 210 mg tezepelumab SC Q4W 
compared with placebo based on assessment of pulmonary function, health status/health 
related quality of life, asthma control and asthma symptoms, respectively. The study will also 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of tezepelumab based on assessment of AEs (including 
SAEs), vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry,

Serious Cardiac Events Post-Authorisation Safety Study
A Non-Interventional Multi-Country Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) to Assess 
the Incidence of Serious Cardiac Events in Patients with Severe Uncontrolled Asthma 
Exposed to Tezepelumab
Rationale and study objectives
A numerical imbalance in serious cardiac events was observed in a single study 
(D5180C00018); thus to further characterise serious cardiac events AstraZeneca will conduct 
a non-interventional multi-country PASS to assess risk of serious cardiac events with
tezepelumab treatment in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma.
The main aim of the tezepelumab non-interventional study is to evaluate possible effects of 
tezepelumab exposure in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma on serious cardiac events. 
41 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab
AstraZeneca
Version: 2
The overall objective of the study is to compare the incidence of serious cardiac events in 
patients with severe uncontrolled asthma newly exposed to tezepelumab with the incidence in 
comparable severe uncontrolled asthma patients exposed to other standard of care regimens. 
The specific objectives are to be determined following consultation with CHMP/PRAC.
Study Design
This study will be a non-interventional observational cohort study of patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma receiving tezepelumab compared with comparable patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma on standard of care using a tezepelumab new user design and propensity 
score approach. Multiple observational data sources in the EU will be analysed separately and, 
subsequently, a meta-analysis will be performed (where feasible). Sources in the US may also 
be included if required to attain desired sample size.
Potential outcomes under consideration include: MACE (Cardiovascular death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke); MACE+ (MACE + Hospitalisation for heart failure, 
unstable angina); individual components of MACE, Hospitalisation for heart failure, unstable 
angina; and a broader definition of serious cardiac events (to be determined).
Study Population
The study population will be patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, aged ≥ 12 years in-line 
with the current tezepelumab indication. Patients will be selected using asthma diagnosis 
codes and medication prescription codes in the EHR sources that are indicative of severe 
uncontrolled asthma. Specific inclusion/exclusion criteria will be defined in the protocol 
development stage.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
FOR TEZSPIRE™ (TEZEPELUMAB)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TEZSPIRE™. The RMP details 
important risks of TEZSPIRE, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about TEZSPIRE’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
TEZSPIRE's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how tezepelumab should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for TEZSPIRE should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
TEZSPIRE’s RMP.

THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
The proposed indication of TEZSPIRE is as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older with severe asthma (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains tezepelumab as the active substance and it is given/self-administered by 
subcutaneous injection.
Further information about the evaluation of TEZSPIRE’s benefits can be found in 
TEZSPIRE’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage

VI.2
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS
Important risks of TEZSPIRE, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about TEZSPIRE’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of tezepelumab is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
VI.2.1
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of TEZSPIRE are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
47 (57)
EU RMP
Tezepelumab

Version: 2
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of TEZSPIRE. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dexmedetomidine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The MAH undertook a full cumulative review of case reports of polyuria, identified by the search of 
polyuria and related PTs, taking into consideration temporal relationship, dose, age, and use.  
Based on the association of polyuria with induction of dexmedetomidine infusion, and reports of 
recovery after discontinuation of dexmedetomidine representing positive dechallenge, the data are 
supportive of a causal association.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing dexmedetomidine were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dexmedetomidine the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dexmedetomidine is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Epysqli is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of: 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). 
- 
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical 
symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 
5.1). 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (see section 5.1). 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Epysqli must be administered by a healthcare professional and under the supervision of a physician 
experienced in the management of patients with haematological or renal disorders. 
Home infusion may be considered for patients who have tolerated infusions well in the clinic. The 
decision of a patient to receive home infusions should be made after evaluation and recommendation 
from the treating physician. Home infusions should be performed by a qualified healthcare 
professional. 
Posology 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) in adults 
The PNH dosing regimen for adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) consists of a 4-week initial phase 
followed by a maintenance phase:

• 
• 
Initial phase: 600 mg of Epysqli administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) 
intravenous infusion every week for the first 4 weeks. 
Maintenance phase: 900 mg of Epysqli administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 
minutes) intravenous infusion for the fifth week, followed by 900 mg of Epysqli administered 
via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) intravenous infusion every 14 ± 2 days (see 
section 5.1). 
atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) in adults 
The aHUS dosing regimen for adult patients (≥18 years of age) consists of a 4 week initial phase 
followed by a maintenance phase: 
• 
Initial phase: 900 mg of Epysqli administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) 
intravenous infusion every week for the first 4 weeks. 
Maintenance phase: 1,200 mg of Epysqli administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 
minutes) intravenous infusion for the fifth week, followed by 1,200 mg of Epysqli administered 
via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) intravenous infusion every 14 ± 2 days (see 
section 5.1). 
• 
Paediatric patients in PNH or aHUS 
Paediatric PNH or aHUS patients with body weight ≥ 40 kg are treated with the adult dosing 
recommendations. 
In paediatric PNH and aHUS patients with body weight below 40 kg, Epysqli dosing regimen consists 
of:

Epysqli has not been studied in patients with PNH who weigh less than 40kg. The posology of Epysqli 
to be used in paediatric patients with PNH patients weighing less than 40 kg is identical to the weight-
based dose recommendation provided for paediatric patients with aHUS. Based on the 
pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) data available in patients with aHUS and PNH treated 
with eculizumab, this body-weight based dose regimen for paediatric patients is expected to result in 
an efficacy and safety profile similar to that in adults. 
Supplemental dosing of Epysqli is required in the setting of concomitant plasmapheresis (PP), plasma 
exchange (PE), or fresh frozen plasma infusion (PI) as described below:

Treatment monitoring  
aHUS patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
(see section 4.4 aHUS laboratory monitoring).  
Epysqli treatment is recommended to continue for the patient’s lifetime, unless the discontinuation of 
Epysqli is clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Epysqli may be administered to patients aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that 
any special precautions are needed when older people are treated – although experience with 
eculizumab in this patient population is still limited. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.1). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of eculizumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Method of administration  
Epysqli should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Epysqli should only be 
administered via intravenous infusion as described below. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
The diluted solution of Epysqli should be administered by intravenous infusion over 25 – 45 minutes 
(35 minutes ± 10 minutes) in adults and 1-4 hours in paediatric patients under 18 years of age via 
gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump.  
Patients should be monitored for one hour following infusion. If an adverse event occurs during the 
administration of Epysqli, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If 
the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time may not exceed two hours in adults and four hours in 
paediatric patients under 18 years of age. 
There is limited safety data supporting home-based infusions, additional precautions in the home 
setting such as availability of emergency treatment of infusion reactions or anaphylaxis are 
recommended.

Infusion reactions are described in sections 4.4 and 4.8 on the SmPC. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, CHO cell products or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1. 
Eculizumab therapy must not be initiated in patients (see section 4.4): 
-  with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection 
-  who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive 
prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Eculizumab is not expected to affect the aplastic component of anaemia in patients with PNH. 
Meningococcal Infection 
Due to its mechanism of action, the use of eculizumab increases the patient’s susceptibility to 
meningococcal infection (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may 
occur. To reduce the risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to 
receiving eculizumab unless the risk of delaying eculizumab therapy outweighs the risks of developing 
a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate eculizumab treatment less than 2 weeks after 
receiving a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic 
antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 are 
recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Vaccine against 
serogroup B where available is also recommended. Patients must receive vaccination according to 
current national vaccination guidelines for vaccination use. 
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated 
diseases, including PNH and aHUS, may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying 
disease, such as haemolysis (PNH) or TMA (aHUS). Therefore, patients should be closely monitored 
for disease symptoms after recommended vaccination. 
Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given 
to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious or fatal 
meningococcal infections have been reported in eculizumab-treated patients. Sepsis is a common 
presentation of meningococcal infections in patients treated with eculizumab (see section 4.8). All 
patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if 
infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics if necessary. Patients should be 
informed of these signs and symptoms and steps taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians 
must discuss the benefits and risks of eculizumab therapy with patients and provide them with a 
patient information brochure and a patient safety card (see Package Leaflet for a description). 
Other Systemic Infections 
Due to its mechanism of action, eculizumab therapy should be administered with caution to patients 
with active systemic infections. Patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially 
with Neisseria and encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than 
Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet to increase their awareness of 
potential serious infections and the signs and symptoms of them. Physicians should advise patients 
about gonorrhoea prevention. 
Infusion Reactions 
Administration of eculizumab may result in infusion reactions or immunogenicity that could cause 
allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). In clinical trials of the reference 
medicinal product, 1 (0.9%) refractory generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) patient experienced an 
infusion reaction which required discontinuation of eculizumab. No PNH or aHUS patients 
experienced an infusion reaction which required discontinuation of eculizumab. Eculizumab 
administration should be interrupted in all patients experiencing severe infusion reactions and 
appropriate medical therapy administered. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-eculizumab antibodies may develop during eculizumab treatment. No apparent correlation of 
antibody development with clinical response or adverse events has been observed.  
Immunisation 
Prior to initiating eculizumab therapy, it is recommended that patients initiate immunisations 
according to current immunisation guidelines. Additionally, all patients must be vaccinated against 
meningococcal infections at least 2 weeks prior to receiving eculizumab unless the risk of delaying 
eculizumab therapy outweighs the risks of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate 
eculizumab treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine must 
receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines 
against serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic 
meningococcal serogroups. Vaccine against serogroup B where available is also recommended (see 
Meningococcal Infection). 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for 
each age group. 
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated 
diseases, including PNH and aHUS may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying 
disease, such as haemolysis (PNH) or TMA (aHUS). Therefore, patients should be closely monitored 
for disease symptoms after recommended vaccination. 
Anticoagulant therapy 
Treatment with eculizumab should not alter anticoagulant management.  
PNH Laboratory Monitoring 
PNH patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of intravascular haemolysis, including 
serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. PNH patients receiving eculizumab therapy should be 
similarly monitored for intravascular haemolysis by measuring LDH levels, and may require dose 
adjustment within the recommended 14±2 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to 
every 12 days). 
aHUS Laboratory Monitoring 
aHUS patients receiving eculizumab therapy should be monitored for thrombotic microangiopathy by 
measuring platelet counts, serum LDH and serum creatinine, and may require dose adjustment within 
the recommended 14±2 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to every 12 days).

Treatment Discontinuation for PNH 
If patients discontinue treatment with eculizumab they should be closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis. Serious haemolysis is identified by serum LDH levels 
greater than the pre-treatment level, along with any of the following: greater than 25 % absolute 
decrease in PNH clone size (in the absence of dilution due to transfusion) in one week or less; a 
haemoglobin level of < 5 g/dL or a decrease of > 4 g/dL in one week or less; angina; change in mental 
status; a 50 % increase in serum creatinine level; or thrombosis. Monitor any patient who discontinues 
eculizumab for at least 8 weeks to detect serious haemolysis and other reactions. 
If serious haemolysis occurs after eculizumab discontinuation, consider the following 
procedures/treatments: blood transfusion (packed RBCs), or exchange transfusion if the PNH RBCs 
are > 50 % of the total RBCs by flow cytometry; anticoagulation; corticosteroids; or reinstitution of 
eculizumab. In PNH clinical trials, 16 patients discontinued the eculizumab treatment regimen. 
Serious haemolysis was not observed. 
Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS  
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications have been observed as early as 4 weeks and up to 
127 weeks following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment in some patients. Discontinuation of 
treatment should only be considered if medically justified.  
In aHUS clinical studies, 61 patients (21 paediatric patients) discontinued eculizumab treatment with a 
median follow-up period of 24 weeks. Fifteen severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
complications in 12 patients were observed following treatment discontinuation, and 2 severe TMA 
complications occurred in an additional 2 patients that received a reduced dosing regimen of 
eculizumab outside of the approved dosing regimen (see section 4.2). Severe TMA complications 
occurred in patients regardless of whether they had an identified genetic mutation, high risk 
polymorphism or auto-antibody. Additional serious medical complications occurred in these patients 
including severe worsening of kidney function, disease-related hospitalization and progression to end 
stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Despite eculizumab re-initiation following discontinuation, 
progression to end stage renal disease occurred in one patient.  
If aHUS patients discontinue treatment with eculizumab, they should be monitored closely for signs 
and symptoms of severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications. Monitoring may be insufficient 
to predict or prevent severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications in patients with aHUS after 
discontinuation of eculizumab.  
Severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications post discontinuation can be identified by (i) any 
two, or repeated measurement of any one, of the following: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or 
more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during eculizumab treatment; an increase 
in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during eculizumab treatment; 
or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during eculizumab 
treatment; or (ii) any one of the following: a change in mental status or seizures; angina or dyspnoea; 
or thrombosis.  
If severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications occur after eculizumab discontinuation, consider 
reinstitution of eculizumab treatment, supportive care with PE/PI, or appropriate organ-specific 
supportive measures including renal support with dialysis, respiratory support with mechanical 
ventilation or anticoagulation. 
Educational materials 
All physicians who intend to prescribe eculizumab must ensure they are familiar with the physician’s 
guide to prescribing. Physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of eculizumab therapy with 
patients and provide them with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card.

Patients should be instructed that if they develop fever, headache accompanied with fever and/or stiff 
neck or sensitivity to light, they should immediately seek medical care as these signs may be 
indicative of meningococcal infection. 
Sodium content 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 0.47 g sodium per 240 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 23.4 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45 %) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 0.26 g sodium per 240 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 12.8 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of eculizumab on 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, eculizumab may reduce the expected 
pharmacodynamic effects of rituximab. 
Plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP), fresh frozen plasma infusion (PI) and intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to reduce eculizumab serum levels. A supplemental dose of 
eculizumab is required in these settings. See Section 4.2 for guidance in case of concomitant PE, PP, 
PI, or IVIg treatment.  
Concomitant use of eculizumab with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may reduce effectiveness of 
eculizumab. Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of eculizumab.  
Concomitant use of eculizumab with neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blockers may lower systemic 
exposures and reduce effectiveness of eculizumab. Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of 
eculizumab.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
The use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and for at least 5 months after the last dose of 
treatment with eculizumab should be considered for women of childbearing potential. 
Pregnancy 
There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with eculizumab. Data on a limited 
number of pregnancies exposed to eculizumab (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate there is no 
increased risk of foetal malformation or foetal-neonatal toxicity. However, due to the lack of well-
controlled studies, uncertainties remain. Therefore, an individual risk benefit analysis is recommended 
before starting and during treatment with eculizumab in pregnant women. Should such a treatment be 
considered necessary during pregnancy, a close maternal and foetal monitoring according to local 
guidelines is recommended. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab (see section 5.3). 
Human IgG are known to cross the human placental barrier, and thus eculizumab may potentially 
cause terminal complement inhibition in the foetal circulation. Therefore, eculizumab should be given 
to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 
Breast-feeding 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No effects on the breastfed newborn / infant are anticipated as limited data available suggest that 
eculizumab is not excreted in human breast milk. However, due to the limitations of the available data, 
the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s 
clinical need for eculizumab and any potential adverse events on the breastfed child from eculizumab 
or from the underlying maternal condition. 
Fertility 
No specific study of eculizumab on fertility has been conducted. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Eculizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Supportive safety data were obtained from 33 completed clinical trials that included 1 555 patients 
exposed to eculizumab in complement-mediated disease populations, including PNH, aHUS, gMG and 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD). The most common adverse reaction was 
headache, (occurred mostly in the initial phase of dosing), and the most serious adverse reaction was 
meningococcal infection. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 2 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in eculizumab completed 
clinical trials, including PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD studies. Adverse reactions 
reported at a very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100) 
or rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000) frequency with eculizumab, are listed by system organ class and 
preferred term. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

cADRs identified in post marketing reports 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In all clinical trials, the most serious adverse reaction was meningococcal sepsis which is a common 
presentation of meningococcal infections in patients treated with eculizumab (see section 4.4). 
Other cases of Neisseria species have been reported including sepsis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 
Neisseria sicca/subflava, Neisseria spp unspecified. 
Antibodies to eculizumab were detected in patients. As with all proteins there is a potential for 
immunogenicity. 
Cases of haemolysis have been reported in the setting of missed or delayed eculizumab dose in PNH 
clinical trials (see also section 4.4). 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy complication have been reported in the setting of missed or 
delayed eculizumab dose in aHUS clinical trials. 
Paediatric population 
In children and adolescent PNH patients (aged 11 years to less than 18 years) included in the 
paediatric PNH Study M07-005, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. 
The most common adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was headache. 
In paediatric aHUS patients (aged 2 months to less than 18 years) included in the aHUS studies C08-
002, C08-003, C09-001r and C10-003, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult 
aHUS patients. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age appear similar.

Elderly 
No overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger refractory 
gMG patients (< 65 years) in eculizumab study. 
Patients with other diseases 
Safety Data from Other Clinical trials 
Supportive safety data were obtained in 12 completed clinical trials that included 934 patients exposed 
to eculizumab in other disease populations other than PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG or NMOSD. There 
was an un-vaccinated patient diagnosed with idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy who 
experienced meningococcal meningitis. Adverse reactions reported in patients with disease other than 
PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG or NMOSD were similar to those reported in patients with PNH, aHUS, 
refractory gMG or NMOSD (see Table 2 above). No specific adverse reactions have emerged from 
these clinical trials.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AJ01 
Eculizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG2/4k antibody that binds to the human C5 
complement protein and inhibits the activation of terminal complement. The eculizumab antibody 
contains human constant regions and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted onto the 
human framework light- and heavy-chain variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino 
acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 
148 kDa. 
Epysqli is produced in a CHO cell line expression system and purified by affinity and ion exchange 
chromatography. The bulk active substance manufacturing process also includes specific viral 
inactivation and removal steps. 
Epysqli is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Mechanism of action 
Eculizumab, the active substance in Epysqli, is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds 
to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and 
preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab preserves the early 
components of complement activation that are essential for opsonisation of microorganisms and 
clearance of immune complexes. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In PNH patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated 
intravascular haemolysis are blocked with eculizumab treatment. 
In most PNH patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of approximately 35 microgram/mL are 
sufficient for essentially complete inhibition of terminal complement-mediated intravascular 
haemolysis. 
In PNH, chronic administration of eculizumab resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in 
complement- mediated haemolytic activity. 
In aHUS patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-
mediated thrombotic microangiopathy are blocked with eculizumab treatment.  
All patients treated with eculizumab when administered as recommended demonstrated rapid and 
sustained reduction in terminal complement activity. In all aHUS patients, eculizumab serum 
concentrations of approximately 50 - 100 microgram/mL are sufficient for essentially complete 
inhibition of terminal complement activity.  
In aHUS, chronic administration of eculizumab resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in 
complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
The safety and efficacy of eculizumab in PNH patients with haemolysis were assessed in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (C04-001). PNH patients were also 
treated with eculizumab in a single arm 52 week study (C04-002), and in a long term extension study 
(E05-001). Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab. In all studies, 
the dose of eculizumab was 600 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 ± 2 days 
later, then 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study duration. Eculizumab was administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 25 – 45 minutes (35 minutes ± 10 minutes). An observational non-
interventional Registry in patients with PNH (M07-001) was also initiated to characterize the natural 
history of PNH in untreated patients and the clinical outcomes during eculizumab treatment. 
In study C04-001 (TRIUMPH) PNH patients with at least 4 transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow 
cytometric confirmation of at least 10 % PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100 000 /microliter 
were randomized to either eculizumab (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomisation, all patients 
underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the 
haemoglobin concentration (the "set-point") which would define each patient’s haemoglobin 
stabilisation and transfusion outcomes. The haemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in 
patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Primary 
efficacy endpoints were haemoglobin stabilisation (patients who maintained a haemoglobin 
concentration above the haemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week 
period) and blood transfusion requirement. Fatigue and health-related quality of life were relevant 
secondary endpoints. 
Haemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of 
PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic 
corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced 
(see Table 3). 
In the non-controlled study C04-002 (SHEPHERD), PNH patients with at least one transfusion in the 
prior 24 months and at least 30 000 platelets/microliter received eculizumab over a 52-week period. 
Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents in 63 % of the patients and systemic 
corticosteroids in 40 % of the patients. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 3.

In TRIUMPH, study patients treated with eculizumab had significantly reduced (p< 0.001) haemolysis 
resulting in improvements in anaemia as indicated by increased haemoglobin stabilisation and 
reduced need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 4). These effects 
were seen among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 
25 units; > 25 units). After 3 weeks of eculizumab treatment, patients reported less fatigue and 
improved health-related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of 
eculizumab on thrombotic events could not be determined. In SHEPHERD study, 96 of the 97 
enrolled patients completed the study (one patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in 
intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and 
resulted in increased transfusion avoidance, a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. See 
Table 4.

From the 195 patients that originated in C04-001, C04-002 and other initial studies, eculizumab-
treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long term extension study (E05-001). All patients sustained a 
reduction in intravascular haemolysis over a total eculizumab exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 
months. There were fewer thrombotic events with eculizumab treatment than during the same period 
of time prior to treatment. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, this finding was shown in non-controlled clinical trials. 
The PNH registry (M07-001) was used to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab in PNH patients with no 
history of RBC transfusion. These patients had high disease activity as defined by elevated haemolysis 
(LDH ≥ 1.5 x ULN) and the presence of related clinical symptom(s): fatigue, haemoglobinuria, 
abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia (haemoglobin < 100 g/L), major adverse 
vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. 
In the PNH Registry, patients treated with eculizumab were observed to have a reduction in 
haemolysis and associated symptoms. At 6 months, patients treated with eculizumab with no history of 
RBC transfusion had significantly (p< 0.001) reduced LDH levels (median LDH of 305 U/L; Table 5). 
Furthermore, 74 % of the patients without a history of transfusion and treated with eculizumab 
experienced clinically meaningful improvements in FACIT-Fatigue score (i.e., increase by 4 points or 
more) and 84 % in EORTC fatigue score (i.e., decrease by 10 points or more).

Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome  
Data from 100 patients in four prospective controlled studies, three in adult and adolescent patients 
(C08-002A/B C08-003A/B, C10-004) one in paediatric and adolescent patients (C10-003) and 30 
patients in one retrospective study (C09-001r) were used to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab in the 
treatment of aHUS. 
Study C08-002A/B was a prospective, controlled, open-label study which accrued patients in the early 
phase of aHUS with evidence of clinical thrombotic microangiopathy manifestations with platelet 
count ≤ 150 x 109/L despite PE/PI, and LDH and serum creatinine above upper limits of normal.  
Study C08-003A/B was a prospective, controlled, open-label study which accrued patients with longer 
term aHUS without apparent evidence of clinical thrombotic microangiopathy manifestations and 
receiving chronic PE/PI (≥1 PE/PI treatment every two weeks and no more than 3 PE/PI 
treatments/week for at least 8 weeks before the first dose). Patients in both prospective studies were 
treated with eculizumab for 26 weeks and most patients enrolled into a long-term, open-label 
extension study. All patients enrolled in both prospective studies had an ADAMTS-13 level above 5%.  
Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab or received prophylactic 
treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of 
eculizumab in adult and adolescent aHUS patients was 900 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed 
by 1,200 mg 7 ± 2 days later, then 1,200 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study duration. Eculizumab was 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 35 minutes. The dosing regimen in paediatric patients 
and adolescents weighing less than 40 kg was defined based on a pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that identified the recommended dose and schedule based on body weight (see section 4.2).  
Primary endpoints included platelet count change from baseline in study C08-002A/B and thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA) event-free status in study C08-003A/B. Additional endpoints included TMA 
intervention rate, haematologic normalization, complete TMA response, changes in LDH, renal 
function and quality of life. TMA-event free status was defined as the absence for at least 12 weeks of 
the following: decrease in platelet count of > 25% from baseline, PE/PI, and new dialysis. TMA 
interventions were defined as PE/PI or new dialysis. Haematologic normalization was defined as 
normalization of platelet counts and LDH levels sustained for ≥2 consecutive measurements for ≥4 
weeks. Complete TMA response was defined as haematologic normalization and a ≥25% reduction in 
serum creatinine sustained in ≥ 2 consecutive measurements for ≥ 4 weeks.  
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 6.

Patients in aHUS Study C08-002 A/B received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. After 
completion of the initial 26-week treatment period, most patients continued to receive eculizumab by 
enrolling into an extension study. In aHUS Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of eculizumab 
therapy was approximately100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks).  
A reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were 
observed after commencement of eculizumab. Reduction in terminal complement activity was 
observed in all patients after commencement of eculizumab. Table 7 summarizes the efficacy results 
for aHUS Study C08-002A/B. All rates of efficacy endpoints improved or were maintained through 2 
years of treatment. Complete TMA response was maintained by all responders. When treatment was 
continued for more than 26 weeks, two additional patients achieved and maintained Complete TMA 
response due to normalization of LDH (1 patient) and a decrease in serum creatinine (2 patients).  
Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during eculizumab therapy. Four 
of the five patients who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis for the 
duration of eculizumab treatment, and one patient developed a new dialysis requirement. Patients 
reported improved health-related quality of life (QoL). 
In aHUS Study C08-002A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without 
identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.  
Patients in aHUS study C08-003A/B received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. After 
completion of the initial 26-week treatment period, most patients continued to receive eculizumab by 
enrolling into an extension study. In aHUS Study C08-003A/B, the median duration of eculizumab 
therapy was approximately 114 weeks (range: 26 to 129 weeks). Table 7 summarizes the efficacy 
results for aHUS Study C08-003A/B.  
In aHUS Study C08-003A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without

six additional patients achieved and maintained Complete TMA response due to a decrease in serum 
creatinine. No patient required new dialysis with eculizumab. Renal function, as measured by median 
eGFR, increased during eculizumab therapy.

aHUS Study C10-004 enrolled 41 patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy 
(TMA). In order to qualify for enrolment, patients were required to have a platelet count < lower limit 
of normal range (LLN), evidence of haemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum 
creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient 
age was 35 (range: 18 to 80 years). All patients enrolled in aHUS Study C10-004 had an ADAMTS-13 
level above 5%. Fifty-one percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation 
or auto-antibody. A total of 35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 8 summarizes the 
key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in aHUS C10-004.

Patients in aHUS Study C10-004 received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion 
of the initial 26-week treatment period, most patients elected to continue on chronic dosing.  
Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were 
observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated 
TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In aHUS 
C10-004, mean (±SD) platelet count increased from 119 ± 66 x109/L at baseline to 200 ± 84 x109/L 
by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (±SD) at week 26: 252 
± 70 x109/L). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during eculizumab therapy. 
Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during 
eculizumab treatment. Table 9 summarizes the efficacy results for aHUS study C10-004.

1Through data cut-off (September 4, 2012), with median duration of eculizumab therapy of 50 weeks (range: 13 
weeks to 86 weeks). 
Longer term treatment with eculizumab (median 52 weeks ranging from 15 to 126 weeks) was 
associated with an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in adult patients with aHUS. 
When eculizumab treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, three additional patients (63% of 
patients in total) achieved Complete TMA response and four additional patients (98% of patients in

eGFR improvement of ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. 
Paediatric population 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
A total of 7 PNH paediatric patients, with a median weight of 57.2 kg (range of 48.6 to 69.8 kg) and 
aged from 11 to 17 years (median age: 15.6 years), received eculizumab in study M07-005. 
Treatment with eculizumab at the proposed dosing regimen in the paediatric population was associated 
with a reduction of intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum LDH level. It also resulted in a 
marked decrease or elimination of blood transfusions, and a trend towards an overall improvement in 
general function. The efficacy of eculizumab treatment in paediatric PNH patients appears to be 
consistent with that observed in adult PNH patients enrolled in PNH pivotal Studies (C04-001 and 
C04-002) (Table 4 and 10).

Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
A total of 15 paediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) received eculizumab in aHUS Study C09-
001r. Forty seven percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-
antibody. The median time from aHUS diagnosis to first dose of eculizumab was 14 months (range <1, 
110 months). The median time from current thrombotic microangiopathy manifestation to first dose of 
eculizumab was 1 month (range <1 to 16 months). The median duration of eculizumab therapy was 16 
weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for children < 2 years of age (n=5) and 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) 
for children 2 to <12 years of age (n=10).  
Overall, the efficacy results for these paediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed 
in patients enrolled in aHUS pivotal Studies C08-002 and C08-003 (Table 7). No paediatric patient 
required new dialysis during treatment with eculizumab.

In paediatric patients with shorter duration of current severe clinical thrombotic microangiopathy 
(TMA) manifestation prior to eculizumab, there was TMA control and improvement of renal function 
with eculizumab treatment (Table 11).  
In paediatric patients with longer duration of current severe clinical TMA manifestation prior to 
eculizumab, there was TMA control with eculizumab treatment. However, renal function was not 
changed due to prior irreversible kidney damage (Table 12).

A total of 22 paediatric and adolescents patients (aged 5 months to 17 years) received eculizumab in 
aHUS Study C10-003.  
In Study C10-003, patients who enrolled in the study were required to have a platelet count < lower 
limit of normal range (LLN), evidence of haemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH above the 
upper limits of normal and serum creatinine level ≥97 percentile for age without the need for chronic 
dialysis. The median patient age was 6.5 years (range: 5 months to 17 years). Patients enrolled in 
aHUS C10-003 had an ADAMTS-13 level above 5%. Fifty percent of patients had an identified 
complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 10 patients received PE/PI prior to 
eculizumab. Table 13 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of 
patients enrolled in aHUS Study C10-003.

Patients in aHUS C10-003 received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of the 
initial 26-week treatment period, most patients elected to continue on chronic dosing. Reduction in 
terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of eculizumab. 
Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean 
platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean (±SD) platelet count increased from 88 ± 42 
x109/L at baseline to 281 ± 123 x109/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks 
(mean platelet count (±SD) at week 26: 293 ± 106 x109/L). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was 
improved during eculizumab therapy. Nine of the 11 patients who required dialysis at baseline no 
longer required dialysis after Study Day 15 of eculizumab treatment. Responses were similar across all 
ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. In aHUS C10-003, responses to eculizumab were similar in 
patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor 
proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

Longer term treatment with eculizumab (median 55 weeks ranging from 1day to 107 weeks) was 
associated with an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in paediatric and adolescent 
patients with aHUS. When eculizumab treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, one 
additional patient (68% of patients in total) achieved Complete TMA Response and two additional 
patients (91% of patients in total) achieved hematologic normalization. At the last evaluation, 19 of 22

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetics and active substance metabolism 
Biotransformation 
Human antibodies undergo endocytotic digestion in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. 
Eculizumab contains only naturally occurring amino acids and has no known active metabolites. 
Human antibodies are predominately catabolised by lysosomal enzymes to small peptides and amino 
acids. 
Elimination 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the hepatic, renal, lung, or gastrointestinal routes 
of excretion/elimination for eculizumab. In normal kidneys, antibodies are not excreted and are 
excluded from filtration by their size. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters 
In 40 patients with PNH, a 1-compartmental model was used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters 
after multiple doses. Mean clearance was 0.31 ± 0.12 mL/hr/kg, mean volume of distribution was 
110.3 ± 17.9 mL/kg, and mean elimination half-life was 11.3 ± 3.4 days. The steady state is achieved 
by 4 weeks using the PNH adult dosing regimen. 
In PNH patients, pharmacodynamic activity correlates directly with eculizumab serum concentrations 
and maintenance of trough levels above ≥ 35 microgram/mL results in essentially complete blockade 
of haemolytic activity in the majority of PNH patients. 
A second population PK analysis with a standard 1 compartmental model was conducted on the 
multiple dose PK data from 37 aHUS patients receiving the recommended eculizumab regimen in 
studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B. In this model, the clearance of eculizumab for a typical aHUS 
patient weighing 70 kg was 0.0139 L/hr and the volume of distribution was 5.6 L. The elimination 
half-life was 297 h (approximately 12.4 days). 
The second population PK model was applied to the multiple dose PK data from 22 paediatric aHUS 
patients receiving the recommended eculizumab regimen in aHUS C10-003. The clearance and 
volume of distribution of eculizumab are weight dependent, which forms the basis for a weight 
categorical based dose regimen in paediatric patients (see section 4.2). Clearance values of eculizumab 
in paediatric aHUS patients were 10.4, 5.3, and 2.2 mL/hr with body weight of 70, 30, and 10 kg, 
respectively; and the corresponding volume of distribution values were 5.23, 2.76, and 1.21 L, 
respectively. The corresponding elimination half-life remained almost unchanged within a range of 
349 to 378 h (approximately 14.5 to 15.8 days).  
The clearance and half-life of eculizumab were also evaluated during plasma exchange interventions. 
Plasma exchange resulted in an approximately 50% decline in eculizumab concentrations following a 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 hour intervention and the elimination half-life of eculizumab was reduced to 1.3 hours. 
Supplemental dosing is recommended when eculizumab is administered to aHUS patients receiving 
plasma infusion or exchange (see section 4.2).  
All aHUS patients treated with eculizumab when administered as recommended demonstrated rapid 
and sustained reduction in terminal complement activity. In aHUS patients, pharmacodynamic activity 
correlates directly with eculizumab serum concentrations and maintenance of trough levels of 
approximately 50-100 microgram/ml results in essentially complete blockade of terminal complement 
activity in all aHUS patients.  
PK parameters are consistent across PNH and aHUS patient populations. Pharmacodynamic activity 
measured by free C5 concentrations of < 0.5 ug/mL, is correlated with essentially complete blockade 
of terminal complement activity in PNH and aHUS patients. 
Special populations 
Dedicated studies have not been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in special 
patient populations identified by gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic 
impairment. 
Population PK analysis on data collected across studies in PNH and aHUS patients showed that 
gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment/function do not influence 
the PK of eculizumab. Body weight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab 
clearance in paediatric patients requiring body weight based dosing in paediatric patients. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab was evaluated in Study M07-005 in PNH paediatric patients 
(aged from 11 to less than 18 years) and in Studies C08-002, C08-003, C09-001r and C10-003 in 
aHUS paediatric patients (aged 2 months to less than 18 years) with body-weight based dose regimen.  
Weight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab clearance 0.0105 L/h in the 
adolescent PNH patients.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The specificity of eculizumab for C5 in human serum was evaluated in two in vitro studies. 
The tissue cross-reactivity of eculizumab was evaluated by assessing binding to a panel of 38 human 
tissues. C5 expression in the human tissue panel examined in this study is consistent with published 
reports of C5 expression, as C5 has been reported in smooth muscle, striated muscle, and renal 
proximal tubular epithelium. No unexpected tissue cross-reactivity was observed. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab due to lack of pharmacologic 
activity in non-human species. 
In a 26 week toxicity study performed in mice with a surrogate antibody directed against murine C5, 
treatment did not affect any of the toxicity parameters examined. Haemolytic activity during the 
course of the study was effectively blocked in both female and male mice. 
No clear treatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in reproductive toxicology studies 
in mice with a surrogate terminal complement inhibitory antibody, which was utilised to assess the 
reproductive safety of C5 blockade. These studies included assessment of fertility and early embryonic 
development, developmental toxicity, and pre and post-natal development. 
When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia 
and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher antibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human eculizumab dose, 
based on a body weight comparison); however, the exposure did not increase foetal loss or neonatal 
death. 
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of 
eculizumab.

1.  What Epysqli is and what it is used for 
What is Epysqli 
Epysqli contains the active substance eculizumab and it belongs to a class of medicines called 
monoclonal antibodies. Eculizumab binds to and inhibits a specific protein in the body that causes 
inflammation and so prevents your body’s systems from attacking and destroying vulnerable blood 
cells, kidneys, muscles or eye nerves and spinal cord. 
What is Epysqli used for 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
Epysqli is used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood 
system called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH). In patients with PNH, their red blood 
cells can be destroyed which can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in 
functioning, pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab can block the body’s 
inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable PNH blood cells. 
Atypcial Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
Epysqli is also used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the 
blood system and kidney called atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). In patients with 
aHUS, their kidney and blood cells, including platelets, can be inflamed which can lead to low blood 
counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood clots, tiredness and 
difficulty in functioning. Eculizumab can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to 
attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood and kidney cells. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Epysqli  
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use Epysqli 
- 
If you are allergic to eculizumab, proteins derived from mouse products, other monoclonal 
antibodies, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless you take antibiotics to 
reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated . 
If you have a meningococcal infection. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections alert 
Epysqli treatment may reduce your natural resistance to infections, especially against certain 
organisms that cause meningococcal infection (severe infection of the linings of the brain and sepsis) 
and other Neisseria infections including disseminated gonorrhea. 
Consult your doctor before you take Epysqli to be sure that you receive vaccination against Neisseria 
meningitidis, an organism that causes meningococcal infection, at least 2 weeks before beginning 
therapy, or that you take antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been 
vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should also be 
aware that vaccination may not prevent this type of infection. In accordance with national 
recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to prevent 
infection. 
If you are at risk of gonorrhoea, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  
Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating certain types of infection in patients who 
receive Epysqli, you will be provided a card to carry with you, listing specific trigger symptoms. This 
card is named: “Patient Safety Card”. 
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
headache with nausea or vomiting 
headache with a stiff neck or back 
fever 
rash 
confusion 
severe muscle aches combined with flu-like symptoms 
sensitivity to light 
Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a remote region where you are unable to contact your doctor or in which you 
find yourself temporarily unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor can make arrangements to 
issue, as a preventive measure, a prescription for an antibiotic to counter Neisseria meningitidis that 
you keep with you. If you experience any of the symptoms amongst those cited above, you should take 
the antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should see a doctor as soon as possible, 
even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. 
Infections 
Before starting Epysqli, inform your doctor if you have any infections. 
Allergic reactions 
Epysqli contains a protein and proteins can cause allergic reactions in some people. 
Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over. 
Other medicines and Epysqli 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Women of childbearing potential 
The use of effective contraception during treatment and up to 5 months after treatment should be 
considered in women who are able to get pregnant. 
Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Epysqli has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Epysqli contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.47 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 240 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 23.4 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You 
should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45 %) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.26 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 240 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 12.8 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You 
should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
3. 
How to use Epysqli
At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Epysqli, your doctor will administer a vaccine against 
meningococcal infection if it was not previously administered or if your vaccination is outdated. If 
your child is below the age of vaccination or if you are not vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start 
treatment with Epysqli, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 
weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
Your doctor will administer a vaccine to your child aged less than 18 years against Haemophilus 
influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination recommendations for 
each age group. 
Instructions for proper use 
The treatment will be given by your doctor or other health care provider by infusing a dilution of the 
Epysqli vial from a drip bag through a tube directly into one of your veins. It is recommended that the 
beginning of your treatments, called the initial phase, will extend over 4 weeks, followed by a 
maintenance phase.

•  Diluted solution of Epysqli may be stored at 2 °C – 8 °C or at room temperature (up to 30 °C) for 
24 hours after removal from refrigeration. However, if the solution is prepared in aseptic (germ-
free) conditions, it can be stored in the refrigerator at 2 °C to 8 °C up to 3 months and for an 
additional 72 hours at room temperature (up to 30°C) when diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9 %) solution for injection, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/ml (0.45 %) solution for injection. 
3- Administration 
•  Do not administer Epysqli as an intravenous push or bolus injection. 
•  Epysqli should only be administered via intravenous infusion. 
•  The diluted solution of Epysqli should be administered by intravenous infusion over 25 to 45 
minutes (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) in adults and 1-4 hours in paediatric patients under 18 years of 
age via gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. It is not necessary to protect the 
diluted solution of Epysqli from light during administration to the patient. 
The patient should be monitored for one hour following infusion. If an adverse event occurs during the

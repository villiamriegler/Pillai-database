SI.1.  HER2-positive Breast Cancer 
SI1.1. 
Incidence and Prevalence 
Approximately 11.7% of all new cancers are female BC, which has an annual incidence rate of 
47.8 per 100,000 persons worldwide.  Australia/New Zealand, Europe, and North America have 
the highest incidence by region.  
BC is the most common cancer in women, accounting for 2.3 million new cases worldwide in 
2020.  In 2020, there were an estimated 7,790,717 women living with BC diagnosed in the last 5 
years worldwide, with a 5-year prevalence proportion of 201.6 per 100,000.  
Approximately 20% of patients with BC globally have HER2-positive tumours. HER2 positivity 
is associated with more aggressive disease.  HER2-positive BC is also associated with negative 
hormone receptor (HR) status and a younger patient population.  Among all BC cases in the 
Cortet study , 6.3% were HR-positive/HER2-positive and 3.7% were 
HR-negative/HER2-positive.  
Crude and world- and Europe-standardised incidence rates for HER2-positive BC are compared 
to overall BC incidence rates in Table Part II: Module SI.1.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
European Union (EU):  
In the 27 members of the EU (EU-27), 355,457 new cases of female BC were diagnosed in 2020, 
comprising approximately 12.1% of all cancers.  The estimated annual age-standardised 
(worldwide) incidence rate of BC is 82.46 per 100,000 in the EU.  In 2020, there were an 
estimated 1,457,608 women living with BC in the EU who were diagnosed in the last 5 years, 
providing a 5-year prevalence proportion of 640.6 per 100,000.  
Among patients with metastatic BC, HER2 overexpression varies from 22% (France) to 34% 
(Italy). For Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK), the numbers were 32.4%, 26.3% 
and 28.4%, respectively.  The study population comprised a total of 152,311 patients with 
metastatic BC in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy (EU-5) countries.  HER2-
positive/HR-negative BC was the least prevalent in France (9%) and most prevalent in Italy 
(13.5%).  The proportion of HER2-positive/HR-positive patients ranged from 13.1% in France to 
20.7% in Italy.  
Breast cancer patients tested IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ without HER2 gene amplification are defined as 
HER2-low.  An estimated 45% to 55% of all primary BC patients are HER2-low. The majority 
(65% to 83%) of the HER2-low BC patients have HR-positive tumours, which are mostly 
luminal subtype.  The rest of the HER2-low BC patients are HR negative and are predominantly 
basal-like subtype.  For the therapeutic purpose, patients with HER2-low BC are currently 
considered to have HER2-negative BC.  
SI1.2. 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for 
the Disease 
Sex:  Breast cancer is mainly a disease in females, with 1% of cases occurring in males.  
Age:  In the EU-27, approximately 11.4% of BCs occur in women younger than 45 years of age.  
BCs are most commonly (47%) diagnosed among women 55 years to 75 years of age in the EU.  
Worldwide, 48% of the newly diagnosed patients with BC are 45 years to 64 years of age.  BC 
incidence is much higher among adults and increases with age, with the highest incidence rate 
among those 65 years and older.  
Among patients with metastatic BC, those with HER2-positive tumours are younger than those 
with HER2-negative tumours (including HER2-low).  The youngest among a metastatic BC EU-
5 population seemed to be those with HER2-positive HR-negative tumours, where 28% were 
younger than 50 years of age.  
Race and/or Ethnicity:  According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
cancer query system, age-adjusted incidence of BC is highest in White females (104.1 per 
100,000).  Incidence of BC in Black and Asian/Pacific Islander females is 99.2 and 85.4 per 
100,000, respectively.  BC risk is lower in Hispanic females, with an age-adjusted incidence rate 
of 80.3 per 100,000. 
Family history:  Women with a family history, especially a mother, sister, or daughter who has 
or had BC, have a higher risk of having BC.  In western countries, genetic predisposition is the 
cause of up to 10% of BC cases.  The most common inherited causes are mutation in the BRCA1 
and BRCA2 genes.  
Reproductive factors:  Women who have early menarche (before age 12) or late menopause 
(after age 55) have a higher risk of developing BC.  Nulliparous women and women who are 
over age 30 at their first birth may have a greater chance of developing BC.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Obesity:  Obesity increases the risk of BC (possibly through an increase in oestrogen levels) in 
postmenopausal women.  In premenopausal women, obesity is associated with a reduced 
incidence of BC.  
Previous benign breast disease:  Women with atypical epithelial hyperplasia have a higher risk 
(4 to 5 times) of developing BC.  
Birth control pills:  Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase the risk of developing BC.  
The risk decreases once the pills are stopped.  Ten years after cessation of the oral contraceptive 
agent, there is no significantly increased risk of having BC.  
Combined postmenopausal hormone therapy:  Women who use combined hormone therapy 
after menopause have an increased risk of developing BC.  There is a dose-response relationship, 
with larger risks corresponding with longer durations of combined hormonal therapy use.  
Radiation exposure: Children or young adults exposed to radiation therapy to the chest area 
have a significantly increased risk of developing BC later in life.  
SI1.3. 
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Although HER2-targeted drugs have been developed as molecularly targeted therapies, locally 
advanced and metastatic tumours invariably relapse with time.  
HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer 
The first targeted agent for HER2 therapy, trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®), is a humanized mAb 
directed against the extracellular domain of HER2.  Other HER2-targeting agents have 
subsequently been approved, including the ADC KADCYLA® (T-DM1); the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor NERLYNX® (neratinib) as monotherapy in early-stage BC and in combination with 
capecitabine in metastatic BC; the mAbs PERJETA® (pertuzumab) and MARGENZA® 
(margetuximab), and  the tyrosine kinase inhibitors TYKERB® (lapatinib) and TUKYSA 
(tucatinib) each in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.  Although anti-HER2 
targeted therapies have improved outcomes, they are not curative in the metastatic setting.  The 
ADC T-DXd (Enhertu®) monotherapy was approved as a new treatment option in the United 
States (US), EU, Japan and a few other countries for patients with HER2-positive unresectable or 
metastatic BC who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens.   
The current standard of care (SoC) for newly diagnosed HER2-positive metastatic BC in Europe 
is a combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and taxane, per the European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO), based on results from the CLEOPATRA study. T-DXd has been established 
as the standard of care for subsequent-line anti-HER2 therapy.  
Tucatinib was approved based on the results from the HER2CLIMB study, in which subjects 
previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1 were randomised to receive 
trastuzumab plus capecitabine with or without tucatinib. 
HER2-low Metastatic Breast Cancer 
Current therapeutic guidelines for patients with BC exhibiting HER2-low expression are the 
same as those for patients with HER2-negative BC.  For patients with metastatic HER2-negative 
BC, treatment recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, ESMO, and 
the Japanese Breast Cancer Society clinical practice guidelines are based on tumour HR status, 
presence or absence of visceral crisis, and menopausal status.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
HER2-low Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer 
In the first-line metastatic setting, in the absence of a visceral crisis, the SoC for patients with 
HER2-/HR+ BC is endocrine therapy (ET) with or without a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 
(CDK4/6) inhibitor.  
In the second- and subsequent-line metastatic setting, preferred regimens include, but are not 
limited to, fulvestrant in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor if a CDK4/6 inhibitor was not 
previously used, ET plus everolimus, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, a steroidal aromatase 
inactivator, fulvestrant, and selective estrogen receptor modulators.  For PIK3CA-mutated 
tumours, another option includes fulvestrant plus targeted therapy with alpelisib.  Patients with 
deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations can be treated with poly 
adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors.   
Once tumours are refractory to ET, therapeutic guidelines recommend the use of sequential 
systemic single-agent chemotherapy.  Preferred single-agent regimens in this setting include the 
anthracyclines doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin, the antimetabolites capecitabine and 
gemcitabine, the microtubule inhibitors vinorelbine and eribulin, and the taxane paclitaxel.  
Other recommended single agents are the taxanes docetaxel and nanoparticle albumin-bound 
(nab)-paclitaxel, the anthracycline epirubicin, and ixabepilone.  Single-agent chemotherapy is 
preferred over combination therapy in this setting.  
The most recent approved treatment for patients with HR-positive tumours refractory to ET who 
have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy is the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, and 
the ADC sacituzumab govitecan.  T-DXd is the first HER2-targeted therapy to demonstrate 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) over commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic HER2-low BC who have received a prior systemic therapy in the 
metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing 
adjuvant chemotherapy.  
HER2-negative Hormone Receptor-negative (Triple Negative) Breast Cancer 
For patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the treatment in the first-line 
metastatic setting is sequential single-agent chemotherapy, with the same preferred 
chemotherapeutic options as those for patients with HER2-/HR+ BCs who are refractory to ET.  
Regardless of BRCA status, for patients with TNBC previously treated with anthracyclines and 
taxanes in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, platinum agents are the preferred option. For 
patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, the recommendation is to use poly adenosine 
diphosphate -ribose polymerase inhibitors (olaparib or talazoparib) or platinum agents.  
For patients with metastatic TNBC with programmed death-ligand 1-positive disease, the 
preferred therapeutic option in the first-line setting is a programmed cell death protein 
1-blocking antibody (pembrolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy.  
For patients with TNBC who have received at least 2 previous regimens, including at least 1 of 
the treatment regimens in the metastatic setting, the ADC sacituzumab govitecan is approved.  
Positive results from a small cohort of subjects with HR- BC led to approval of T-DXd as 
another targeted-therapy option for this segment of patients with a poor prognosis.

Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, 
Including Mortality and Morbidity 
  According to Globocan data, approximately 684,996 women died from BC worldwide in 
2020, with a 5-year age-adjusted mortality rate of 13.6 per 100,000.  Data from 
279 population-based cancer registries from 67 countries showed that the 5-year survival 
from BC is increasing in most developed countries.  
  Metastatic BC is the third most common cause of death in Europeans after lung and 
colorectal cancer.  The estimated number of deaths from BC in the EU was 91,826 in 
2020.  Overall, BC mortality rates in the EU declined by 15%, from 17.9% in 2002 to 
15.2% per 100,000 in 2012.  The mortality rate increased with increasing age and was 
highest among the oldest age group (70 years to 79 years).  Triple negative and 
HER2-positive subtypes have the worst survival outcome. 
  The 5-year relative survival rate for patients with BC in the US is 90.3%.  Survival is 
higher among White patients than African American patients in all age groups.  Survival 
also differs by cancer stage at diagnosis, with localised disease having a survival rate up 
to 99.0% and metastatic disease having a survival rate up to 29.0%.  Overall, the 5-year 
relative survival for BC has been increasing from 74.5% in 1975 to 92.2% in 2019.  In 
2021, there were an estimated 43,600 deaths among patients with BC in the US.  The 
mortality rate has been estimated to be 20.1 deaths per 100,000 persons per year based on 
the 2015 to 2019 data.  The median age at death was 69 years.  
 
In 2020, Japan had an estimated 17,081 deaths due to BC, with a 5-year mortality rate of 
9.9 per 100,000.  
  Metastatic HER2-positive BC remains an incurable disease that is ultimately fatal.  
Although treatment with anti-HER2 therapies has improved the disease outcomes for 
patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC, the disease invariably 
progresses, with median survival being 2 to 4 years.  
Events that Occur Frequently in Subjects with Metastatic Breast Cancer 
Events that occur frequently in subjects with metastatic BC are described below.  These include 
events associated with the disease or with therapies.   
Bone metastases: Among patients with BC who had distant metastases, bone is the most 
common site for metastasis.  The risk of developing bone metastases within 10 years after 
diagnosis was 7% to 9% according to a Canadian study.  A retrospective study on 35,912 Danish 
patients with BC found that 4.2% of patients with BC develop bone metastasis within 5 years of 
diagnosis.  Among patients with BC who had bone metastases, 47.7% developed skeletal-related 
events (SREs) defined as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, bone pain requiring 
palliative radiotherapy, and orthopedic surgery.  
Brain metastases:  Brain metastasis (BM) was found in 5.1% of patients with BC.  The 
symptoms most commonly associated with BM were headache (35%), vomiting (26%), nausea 
(23%), hemiparesis (22%), visual changes (13%), seizures (12%) and altered mental status (7%).  
In a retrospective study of clinical data of German patients with BC who had BM, median OS 
time after BM development was reported as 7.4 months, with a one-year survival rate of 37.7%.  
Patients with HER2-positive tumours had the longest median OS of 11.6 months (95% 
confidence interval: 10.0, 13.4) and those who received anti-HER2 therapy had a longer median 
OS (17.1 months).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Cardiotoxicity:  Anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin and epirubicin) used in the treatment of BC 
cause a dose-dependent, cumulative, progressive cardiac dysfunction that may ultimately lead to 
symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF).  Cardinale et al reported that in 1344  patients with 
BC receiving anthracycline-based therapy, the incidence of cardiac toxicity was 9.7% at a 
median follow-up of 5.2 years.  
Trastuzumab treatment in patients with HER2-positive BC was associated with cardiac toxicity 
with heart failure incidence up to 4.7% and asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) up to 20.6%.  
Radiation exposure in patients with BC is associated with increased risk of ischemic heart 
disease with a magnitude of the risk of 7.4% per gray.  There was no apparent threshold below 
which there was no risk.  The risk was dose-dependent with a lag time of up to 20 years.  
Hepatoxicity/Liver metastases: Liver metastases develop in approximately half of the women 
with metastatic BC and represent a frequent cause of mortality among these patients.  According 
to a UK study, the risk of developing liver metastasis in 6 years after BC diagnosis is 5.2%.  
Liver metastases were present in only 1.4% of overall patients with BC and 3.3% of patients with 
HER2-positive BC at the time of the initial BC diagnosis and are typically associated with 
metastases at other sites.  In 78.6% of cases, the liver metastases were asymptomatic at the time 
of metastatic diagnosis.  The remainder were symptomatic, presenting with epigastric pain or 
fullness (21.4%), palpable hepatomegaly (27.3%) and ascites (6.2%).  
Pulmonary toxicity/Pulmonary metastases: In a systematic literature review of pneumonitis 
associated with BC therapy, the authors reported that most of the currently used BC treatments 
may induce pneumonitis with an incidence of 1% to 3%.  
Approximately 31% of metastatic patients with BC suffer lung metastasis.  Metastasis to the lung 
is associated with poor prognosis, with patients presenting with clinical symptoms such as pain, 
cough, haemoptysis, pleural effusion, and pulmonary dysfunction. 
SI1.5. 
Important Comorbidities 
Patients with BC who have comorbidities have overall higher mortality compared to patients 
without comorbidities.  
Multiple registry studies have shown a correlation between the presence of comorbidities and 
higher mortality.  A nationwide population-based cohort study of 9329 patients with BC of all 
ages in Denmark, a nationally representative cancer registry in Sweden including 42,646 patients 
with BC from 1992 to 2008, and a Dutch registry-based study of 9123 patients with BC all 
included similar proportions of patients with at least 1 comorbidity (22%, 13%, and 28%, 
respectively).  In each of these studies, patients with at least 1 comorbid condition had a higher 
mortality rate than patients with no comorbidities.  
In the US, a retrospective cohort study (N = 5186) in an elderly BC population found 22% of 
patients had at least 1 comorbidity at the time of BC diagnosis.  Patients with comorbidities had a 
significantly higher mortality rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.4 for patients with a single comorbidity 
and RR = 2.0 for patients with 2 or more comorbidities) compared to patients without any 
comorbidities.  
A systematic review of 18 studies on BC survival and comorbid conditions demonstrated that the 
presence of comorbidities at baseline was an important independent prognostic factor and was 
associated with poorer BC survival.  In this review population, hypertension was the most

common comorbidity.  Other reported common comorbid conditions were cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, previous cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and pulmonary disease.  
Among patients in a study of 5 European countries, the majority of patients with HER2-positive 
BC had no comorbidities (Table Part II: Module SI.2).

SI.2.  HER2-positive Gastric Cancer 
As there are limited epidemiological data in the literature for the HER2-positive GC population, 
data herein are presented on general GC, with HER2-positive GC data included where available.  
SI.2.1. 
Incidence and Prevalence of HER2-positive Gastric Cancer Population  
GC is the fifth most common cancer, accounting for 1.09 million new cases worldwide in 2020.  
Approximately 5.6% of all new cancers are GC, with an annual incidence rate of 11.1 per 
100,000 persons worldwide.  In 2020, there were an estimated 1,805,968 persons worldwide 
living with GC that had been diagnosed in last 5 years, with a 5-year prevalence proportion of 
23.2 per 100,000.  Almost 75.3% of new GC cases occur in Asia.  
Overexpression of HER2 can be found in 8.2% to 29.5% of patients with GC.  HER2 expression 
in GC varies based on the site of the primary tumour (gastric versus GEJ) and histological types.  
Reports of the relationship between HER2 overexpression and disease prognosis in patients with 
GC are inconsistent:  some studies found HER2 positivity to be associated with more aggressive 
disease, with significantly shortened disease-free survival and OS, while other studies did not 
demonstrate such an association.  
European Union:  In the EU-27, approximately 75,443 new cases of GC were diagnosed in 2020, 
comprising approximately 3% of all cancers.  The estimated annual incidence rate of GC was 6.8 
per 100,000 persons in the EU.  The incidence rate per 100,000 persons was highest in Lithuania 
(13.4), Estonia (12.6), and Latvia (12.1), and lowest in Sweden (3.3), Finland (3.8), and 
Denmark (4.4).  In 2020, there were an estimated 119,887 patients in the EU living with GC that 
had been diagnosed in previous 5 years, with a 5-year prevalence proportion of 26.9 per 100,000.  
SI.2.2.  Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for 
the Disease  
Sex:  GC is more prevalent in males than females, with nearly two-thirds of all new GC cases 
occurring in males.  The worldwide age-standardized incidence of GC in males is 15.8 per 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 14 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
100,000 compared with 7.0 per 100,000 among females.   In the EU-27, incidence (ASR-World) 
of GC in males and females are 22.4 and 10.6 per 100,000 respectively.  
Age:  According to SEER 2014-2018 data, the median age at diagnosis in the US was 68 years, 
with 71.6% of patients diagnosed at 55 years to 84 years of age.  A similar age distribution of 
patients with GC was found in the EU-27, with 73.9% of patients diagnosed at 55 years to 
84 years of age.  
Race and/or Ethnicity:  According to SEER 2018 age-adjusted data, GC was most common in 
persons of Hispanic ethnicity (10.4 per 100,000), the Asian/Pacific Islander population (10.1 per 
100,000), and the Black population (10.0 per 100,000). The incidence was significantly lower in 
the non-Hispanic White population (5.6 per 100,000).  
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection:  H. pylori infection is the main risk factor of GC, with 
a 3-fold to 6-fold increased risk in persons with H. pylori infection compared to persons without 
H. pylori infection.  Approximately 65% to 80% (660,000 new cases) of all GC cases are caused 
by H. pylori.  
Obesity:  Increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk of cardia GC. 
Compared to individuals with a BMI of <25, individuals with a BMI of 30 to 35 have a 2-fold 
higher risk of GC and those with a BMI of >40 have a 3-fold risk.  
Smoking:  Smoking was found to be associated with higher risk of cardia GC, with male 
smokers having a higher risk of GC compared to female smokers.  Approximately 11% of GC 
cases globally and 17% of GC cases in Europe were attributed to smoking.  
Pernicious anaemia:  A person with pernicious anaemia has a 6.9% chance of developing GC, 
particularly non-cardia cancer.  
Diet:  People who have a diet rich in salt and pickled foods exhibit higher rates of GC.  
Consuming preserved meats also increase the risk of GC.  Higher intake of fruits and vegetables 
was associated with a 37% lower risk of GC.  
Socioeconomic status:  Socioeconomic status is inversely associated with GC risk, with higher 
status reported to be associated with lower GC risk.  
Genetics:  CDH1 germline mutations were found in 25% of families with hereditary diffuse GC.  
Mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was linked to familial adenomatous 
polyposis, which involves development of different tumours, including GC.  
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):  Several studies have reported a significant 
association between GERD and cardia GC.  GERD also increases the risk of oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma by 5- to 7-fold.  
SI.2.3.  The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Systemic chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival and quality of life compared to best 
supportive care alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease with adequate 
performance status.  
  For patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive GC, the current SoC in 
the first-line setting in the US, Europe, and Japan is a combination of chemotherapy with 
a fluoropyrimidine agent (fluorouracil or capecitabine or S-1 in Japan) and a platinum 
agent (oxaliplatin or cisplatin), plus the anti-HER2 trastuzumab.  As an alternative to 
platinum-based therapy, irinotecan plus leucovorin and infusional 5-FU (FOLFIRI) was 
shown to be efficacious and well tolerated regardless of HER2 expression and may be 
Proprietary and Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
considered for selected patients.  In the US, the combination of pembrolizumab in 
combination with trastuzumab and fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing 
chemotherapy is approved in first-line setting.  After progression in the first-line therapy, 
response rates and median survival are low.  
 
In the US and EU, T-DXd is approved as a second-line treatment option, and in Japan as 
a third-line treatment option, for HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma patients who had received prior trastuzumab based therapy.   
  Other recommended treatment options for second and further-lines of chemotherapy 
include taxane (docetaxel, paclitaxel), or irinotecan, or ramucirumab as single agent or in 
combination with paclitaxel dependent on Performance Status (PS).  
  Regimens recommended for the third-line and later therapy regardless of HER2 
expression include irinotecan, taxanes, pembrolizumab (if programmed cell death-ligand 
1 expression by combined positive score ≥1), and the trifluridine/tipiracil- regimen.  The 
programmed cell death protein-1-blocking antibody nivolumab is approved in Japan for 
use in the third-line- or later setting.  Survival outcomes in the third-line metastatic 
setting and beyond are poor (approximately 6 months).  
SI.2.4.  Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, 
Including Mortality and Morbidity 
  According to Globocan data, approximately 502,788 men and 266,005 women worldwide 
died from GC in 2020, with a 5-year age-adjusted mortality rate of 7.7 per 100,000.  
 
In the EU-27, an estimated 32,143 men and 19,942 women are expected to die from GC 
in 2020.  
  Metastatic HER2-positive GC remains an incurable disease that is ultimately fatal.  
Although treatment with anti-HER2 therapies has improved the disease outcomes for 
patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive GC, the disease invariably 
progresses, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 32.4% in the US, while Stage IV GC 
has a 5-year survival rate of 5.5%, per the SEER 2011-2017 data.   
Events that Occur Frequently in Subjects with Metastatic Gastric Cancer  
Events that occur frequently in subjects with metastatic GC are described below.  These include 
events associated with the disease or with therapies. 
Bleeding:  Approximately 2% to 8% of all upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding events are 
attributed to GI malignancies.  The majority (58%) of cases of malignancy-related bleeding are 
caused by GC.  In a population-based study in the UK, 62 (21%) of the 300 patients with 
previously undiagnosed GC presented with hematemesis/melena.  
Malignant obstruction:  Patients with advanced GC may develop malignant gastric outlet 
obstruction, which eventually leads to associated symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss.  
Nausea and vomiting:  In a population-based study in the UK, 35% of the 300 patients with 
previously undiagnosed GC presented with vomiting.  In advanced GC, pyloric stenosis may 
cause persistent vomiting.  
Dumping syndrome:  Approximately 68% of patients with GC experience early dumping 
syndrome after gastrectomy, which usually appears within 30 minutes after a meal.  The most 
frequently experienced symptoms include abdominal pain or fullness (46.6%), diarrhoea 
Proprietary and Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
(37.5%), nausea or vomiting (20.3%), palpitations (16.3%), cold sweats (13.2%), and flushing 
(8.2%).  In contrast, 38.4% of patients experienced late dumping syndrome that usually appears 
2 hours to 3 hours after a meal, with hunger (20.7%) and faintness (20.7%), followed by 
dizziness (13.5%), cold sweats (10.2%), tremors (10.1%), and loss of consciousness (2.2%) as 
the most common symptoms.  
Important Comorbidities 
SI.2.5. 
Comorbidities play an important role in cancer treatment choice and patient survival.  Multiple 
population-based studies in the Netherlands have found that 60% to 70% of patients with newly 
diagnosed GC also present with at least 1 comorbid condition.  Hypertension (27.9%), cardiac 
disease (27.3%), digestive tract disease (18.2%), diabetes (16.6%), and previous malignancies 
(13.9%) are the most common comorbid conditions found in patients with stomach cancer.   
Using the SEER-Medicare database, a US retrospective cohort study of 12,612 elderly patients 
with GC found that 61.3% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity.  The prevalence at or before the 
index date and the 12-month incidence of most comorbid conditions were higher among the 
patients with GC compared to a cancer-free matched comparator group.  The 12-month incidence 
of acute comorbid conditions (eg, anaemia, electrolyte disorder, and infection) was higher in 
patients with GC compared to the comparator group, which was thought likely to be related to 
treatment side effects and disease sequelae.  Another retrospective cohort study using the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2001 to 2011 identified all hospitalizations 
associated with GC.  Hypertension (40.3%), anaemia (23.8%), and diabetes without 
complications (15.5%) were found to be the most common comorbidities associated with 
GC-related hospitalization.  Obesity (odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6, 2.6) was 
significantly associated with increased  risk of mortality in this patient population.  
A population-based study in Japan found peptic ulcer (26%), diabetes without chronic 
complications (10%), other cancer (8%), and liver diseases (5%) to be the most common 
comorbidities in patients with GC.  The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for a 
single-point elevation in the Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.23) 
for GC.  
SI.3.  HER2-mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer 
As there are limited epidemiological data in the literature for the HER2-mutant NSCLC 
population, data herein are presented on general lung cancer (LC) and NSCLC, with HER2-
mutant NSCLC data included where available. 
SI.3.1. 
Incidence and Prevalence 
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 2.2 million new cases 
in 2020.  Approximately 11.4% of all new cancers are LC, which has an annual incidence rate of 
22.4 per 100,000 worldwide.  Micronesia/Polynesia (36.7), Eastern Asia (34.4), Western Europe 
(32.7) and Northern America (32.6) have the highest incidence rate by region.  In 2020, there 
were an estimated 2,604,791 men and women living with LC diagnosed in the last 5 years 
around the globe, with a 5-year prevalence proportion of 33.4 per 100,000.  
Approximately 80% to 85% of LC patients have NSCLC according to the American Cancer 
Society.  The HER2 mutation is reported to be found in 1.7% to 4.2% of NSCLC cases.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
In the 27 member states of the EU (ie, the EU-27), 318,327 new cases of LC were diagnosed in 
2020, comprising approximately 11.9% of all cancers.  The estimated annual age-standardised 
(worldwide) incidence rate of LC is 31.2 per 100,000 in the EU.  In 2020, there were an 
estimated 394,704 people living with LC in the EU-27 who were diagnosed in the last 5 years, 
providing a 5-year prevalence proportion of 88.6 per 100,000.  
US: 
In the US, an estimated 236,740 new cases of LC cases were diagnosed in 2022, comprising 
approximately 12.3% of all new cancer cases.  The lifetime risk of developing LC is 
approximately 6%.  The age-standardised (worldwide) incidence rate of LC was estimated to be 
33.1 per 100,000 in the US.  In 2020, there were an estimated 295,263 people living with LC in 
the US who were diagnosed in the last 5 years, providing a 5-year prevalence proportion of 89.2 
per 100,000.  
Japan: 
In Japan, 138,532 new cases of LC were diagnosed in 2020, comprising approximately 13.5% of 
all new cancer cases.  The age-standardised (worldwide) incidence rate of LC was estimated to 
be 32.1 per 100,000 in Japan.  In 2020, there were an estimated 216,629 people living with LC in 
Japan who were diagnosed in the last 5 years, providing a 5-year prevalence proportion of 
171.28 per 100,000.  
SI.3.2.  Demographics of the Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Population and Risk Factors 
for the Disease 
Sex: LC is more common in males than females.  The worldwide age-standardised incidence of 
LC in males and females is 31.5 and 14.6 per 100,000, respectively.  In the EU, the lifetime risk 
of developing LC is 1 in 19 for males and 1 in 37 for females.  Nonsquamous NSCLCs with 
HER2 mutations are more associated with females than NSCLC without HER2 mutations.  
Age: According to Globocan, only 2.4% of LCs in the world occur in people younger than 
45 years.  In the EU, 99% of LCs occur at or after 45 years of age.  The median age at diagnosis 
of LC is 71 years in the US.  Nonsquamous NSCLCs with HER2 mutations are more associated 
with younger age than NSCLC without HER2 mutations.  
Race and/or ethnicity: According to SEER, the age-adjusted incidence of LC is highest in Black 
males, with 71.6 per 100,000 in the US.  Among women, LC incidence is highest in White 
females, with 54.3 per 100,000.  
Smoking: Smoking is, by far, the leading risk factor for LC.  Each year, an estimated 80% of LC 
cases in men and 50% in women are caused by smoking.  
Secondhand smoke (smoke from other people’s cigarettes, pipes, or cigars) also can cause LC.  
According to the American Cancer Society, secondhand smoke is the cause of more than 
7,000 LC deaths each year.  
Nonsquamous NSCLCs with HER2 mutations are more associated with never-smokers than 
NSCLC without HER2 mutations.  
Radon: Radon is the second most common cause of LC and the most common cause among 
never-smokers.  In Europe, the risk of LC increases by 16% with exposure to each 100 Bq/m3 
increase in indoor radon.  In the US, the risk of LC increases by 11% with each 100 Bq/m3 
increase in residential radon.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Occupational carcinogen exposure: Increased LC is associated with exposure to asbestos, 
arsenic, cadmium, chromium, beryllium, and nickel.   Occupational exposure to asbestos (odds 
ratio: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.42, 2.18), crystalline silica (odds ratio: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.71), and 
nickel–chromium (odds ratio: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.53) is associated with increased risk of LC, 
even at a low exposure level.  
Air pollution: The risk of LC is higher among urban people in comparison to rural people.  
Increase in the level of particulate matter 2.5 in the air increases the risk of LC.  Indoor coal 
burning produces gas emissions that are carcinogenic to humans.  
Familial: First-degree relatives of patients with LC have a 1.51-fold (95% CI: 1.39, 1.63) 
increased risk of developing LC.  
Previous radiation therapy: According to the Centers for Disease Control, patients who had 
radiation therapy to the chest for prior cancers are at higher risk of LC. 
SI.3.3.  The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Clinical guidelines from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) for patients with metastatic NSCLC without an 
actionable oncogenic driver irrespective of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status are 
presented below. 
In the first-line metastatic setting, the SoC is a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and 
pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) irrespective of PD-L1 expression.  Other approved treatment 
options based on demonstrated OS improvement over other regimens are combination regimens 
that include atezolizumab or nivolumab. 
In the second-line metastatic setting, the current SoC irrespective of PD-L1 expression for 
patients who have progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and have not received 
prior PD-L1 therapy is anti-programmed cell death protein 1/PD-L1 agents.  Other therapeutic 
options include docetaxel with or without ramucirumab.  Clinical outcomes with currently 
approved treatment options for patients without an actionable oncogenic driver in the second-line 
metastatic setting are generally limited (Table Part II: Module SI.3).

Targeted Therapy (ADC) with Activity Against HER2 Mutations 
T-DXd has been approved in the US on 11 Aug 2022 as a therapy for patients with previously 
treated HER2-mutant metastatic NSCLC.  The use of T-DXd in metastatic HER2-mutant 
NSCLC is also recommended by NCCN.  In addition, NCCN recommends the HER2-targeting 
ADC T-DM1 as a treatment option for patients with metastatic NSCLC and HER2 mutations 
based on a Phase 2 basket study.  
SI.3.4.  Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, 
Including Mortality and Morbidity 
Patients with LC have a dismal prognosis with the highest mortality rate among all cancers.  
Surgical resection is an option in only one-third of patients with LC due to the late detection of 
the disease.  The 5-year OS rate of treatment-naïve Stage IV NSCLC is only 6%.  
According to Globocan data, LC caused approximately 1,796,144 deaths worldwide in 2020, 
with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 18.0 per 100,000.  
LC is the most common cause of cancer death in the EU-27.  The estimated number of deaths 
from LC in the EU was 257,293 in 2020.  Overall, LC mortality rates in the EU declined in many 
countries. According to 2000 to 2007 data, 5-year survival of LC is highest in Austria, Germany, 
and Belgium and lowest in Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Denmark among EU countries.  
Mutations in the gene-encoding HER2 (ERBB2) drive approximately 3% of nonsquamous 
NSCLCs and are associated with female sex, never-smoking history, and a poor prognosis, as 
well as with a slightly younger age and higher incidence of brain metastases than NSCLC 
without HER2 mutations or with other mutations.  
Events That Occur Frequently in Patients with Lung Cancer 
Events that occur frequently in patients with LC are described below.  These include events 
associated with the disease or with therapies. 
Dysgeusia with weight loss: Patients with LC commonly suffer from taste and smell alterations. 
Among patients with LC, 35% to 38% suffer from dysgeusia, and 53.4% of patients have 
significant weight loss.  
Pneumonia: At baseline, 15.9% of patients with NSCLC present with pneumonia.  During the 
course of LC, 50% to 70% of patients suffer from serious lung infections, including pneumonia.  
Bone metastases: Bone is the most common site for metastasis in patients with LC.  At diagnosis, 
57.5% of patients with LC present with bone metastasis.  Among patients with LC who had bone 
metastases, 57.7% developed skeletal related events, defined as bone pain requiring palliative

Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
radiotherapy (71.4%), pathological fractures (16.3%), spinal cord compression (6%), and 
orthopaedic surgery (3.3%).  Patients with LC have a median OS of 9.5 months after bone 
metastasis diagnosis.  
Brain metastases (BM): An estimated 7.4% of patients with NSCLC present with BM at 
diagnosis, and 25% to 30% of patients develop BM during their illness.  NSCLC patients with 
BM have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 3.4 months.  
Cough: Although cough is very common in LC, few robust data have been reported about its 
incidence in patients before treatment.  In a single-institution cross-sectional study conducted in 
the UK, cough was reported by 57% of patients with LC.  
Fatigue: In a study involving consecutive outpatients with Stage IV LC, fatigue was reported by 
40% of patients.  Fatigue can be caused by the disease, the treatment, or psychological distress.  
The prevalence of fatigue is 57% in surgically treated early-stage LC and 70% among LC 
survivors.  
Hemoptysis: Hemoptysis is one of the most frequent clinical manifestations of LC.  An estimated 
10% to 30% of patients with LC in the US suffer from hemoptysis during their disease course.  
Massive hemoptysis can be found in 10% of these patients.  
SI.3.5. 
Important Comorbidities 
Most frequent comorbidities in patients with LC are usually smoking-related illnesses.  This 
includes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.  Diabetes and its complications also share 
common risk factors with LC and frequently present in these patients.  
A nationwide population-based cohort study of 10,378 patients with NSCLC of all ages in 
Denmark showed that 53% of patients have at least 1 comorbidity.  NSCLC patients with 
comorbidities (hazard ratio: 1.12 for single disorder and 1.27 for multiple disorder) have overall 
higher mortality compared to patients without comorbidities.  In Cox regression analysis, hazard 
ratio was significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular disorder (hazard ratio: 1.30, 
CI: 1.13, 1.49), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio: 1.2, CI: 1.10, 1.31), 
diabetes (hazard ratio: 1.19, CI: 1.02, 1.39), and cerebrovascular disorders (hazard ratio 1.18, 
CI: 1.05, 1.33).  
In a population-based cohort study from French cancer registries, 55% of the 1130 patients with 
NSCLC presented with at least 1 comorbidity.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure were the most frequent comorbidities.  
Even though observed and net survival rates decreased for Charlson Comorbidity Index 
Grade ≥3 for NSCLC, after adjustment for sex, age group, stage, and diagnostic mode, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index grades were no longer associated with lower survival rates.  
In the US, a retrospective cohort study (N = 6662) in the LC population found 51% of patients 
had at least 1 comorbidity and 18% had at least 4 comorbidities at the time of cancer diagnosis.  
Chronic lung disease (43%), peripheral vascular disease (24%), renal disease (21%), diabetes 
with (15%) or without (9%) complications, prior cancer or metastatic carcinoma (15%), 
cerebrovascular disease (12%), myocardial infarction (11%), and heart failure (11%) were the 
most frequent comorbid conditions among the study population.  Patients in comorbidity class 1 
had significantly higher survival compared to the patients in other classes (2 to 5).  
Some studies also suggest that the presence of comorbidity in patients with LC had led to a 
higher frequency of physician visits and was associated with early diagnosis of LC.

Relevance to Human Usage 
Toxicity  
Intestinal toxicity: 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In monkeys given 78.8 mg/kg of T-DXd (dosing once 
every 3 weeks [q3w] for 6 weeks), diarrhoea was 
noted.  T-DXd -treated rats and monkeys had very 
slight single-cell necrosis of the crypt epithelium in 
the small and large intestines at low doses (rat: 
≥20 mg/kg; monkey: ≥3 mg/kg).  These changes 
showed reversibility after a recovery period in both 
rats and monkeys.  
Released drug: 
The intestinal toxicity caused by T-DXd also occurred 
in the 4-week intermittent dose study (once-weekly 
dosing) of the released drug in rats and monkeys (rat: 
≥3 mg/kg; monkey: 12 mg/kg).   
Nonclinical studies in rats and monkeys 
indicated a potential for GI effects, such as 
diarrhoea, with T-DXd and released drug.  
Several GI events are considered identified 
risks for T-DXd; however, these events can 
be adequately managed through labelling and 
are not considered important risks for 
inclusion in the RMP (Section SVII.3).

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Haematological findings with T-DXd and 
released drug, including decreased 
haematopoietic cells (ie, red blood cells, 
white blood cells, and platelets) and 
reversible histopathological changes in 
lymphoid organs, were seen in nonclinical 
studies with rats and monkeys.  Similarly, 
haematological laboratory abnormalities were 
observed in clinical studies.  Anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, including 
febrile neutropenia, are considered identified 
risks for T-DXd; however, they are not 
considered important risks for inclusion in the 
RMP as they can be managed through 
standard clinical practice (Section SVII.1.1).   
Lymphatic/haematopoietic toxicity: 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In the rat 6-week intermittent-dose (q3w dosing) 
toxicity study of T-DXd, a decrease in reticulocyte 
ratio at ≥20 mg/kg and decreases in white blood cell 
parameters (lymphocyte, eosinophil, basophil, and 
neutrophil counts) at ≥60 mg/kg were observed.  The 
haematological changes in rats seemed to be 
associated with the following histopathological 
changes: decreased erythroblasts, single-cell necrosis 
of lymphocytes in the thymus, atrophy of follicles in 
the submandibular lymph nodes, and Peyer’s patches 
at ≥60 mg/kg and decreased myelocytes in the bone 
marrow and atrophy in the thymus at 197 mg/kg.  In 
the monkey 3-month intermittent dose (q3w dosing) 
toxicity study of T-DXd, a decrease in reticulocyte 
ratio associated with decreased erythroblasts in the 
bone marrow was observed at 30 mg/kg.  At the 
higher dose of 78.8 mg/kg in the 6-week intermittent 
dose toxicity study, decreased peripheral erythroid 
parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
and reticulocyte ratio) were also observed.   
Released drug: 
The lymphatic/hematopoietic organ toxicity observed 
with T-DXd also occurred in the 4-week intermittent 
dose (once-weekly dosing) study of the released drug 
in rats and monkeys (rat: ≥3 mg/kg; monkey: ≥1 
mg/kg).

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Nonclinical studies in monkeys suggested T-
DXd could potentially lead to pulmonary 
toxicity, with an associated dose dependency 
in incidence and severity.  Events of dose-
dependent ILD have been observed in clinical 
studies, with fatal outcomes reported.  
ILD/pneumonitis is considered an important 
identified risk for inclusion in this RMP 
(Section SVII.3). 
Pulmonary toxicity:  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
T-DXd caused pulmonary toxicity in monkeys at 30 
mg/kg, and no pulmonary toxicity was observed in 
rats.  In the 6-week monkey intermittent dose (q3w 
dosing, 3 animals/sex/group) toxicity study of T-DXd, 
1 male given 78.8 mg/kg showed aggregation of 
foamy macrophages in the alveolus, focal interstitial 
inflammation, alveolar oedema, and anisokaryosis of 
the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium at the end of 
the dosing period.  Similar histopathological changes 
were found in 1 male and 2 females in the 78.8 mg/kg 
recovery group (2 animals/sex).  In contrast, no 
changes in the lungs were noted in all monkeys in the 
30 mg/kg group at the end of the dosing period (3 
animals/sex), and very slight changes that were not 
accompanied by alveolar oedema were found in 1 of 4 
monkeys at the end of the recovery period (2 
animals/sex).  The incidence and severity of the 
lesions were dose dependent.  In the monkey 3-month 
study of T-DXd, similar lesions in the lungs were 
observed in the 30 mg/kg group (the highest dose) at 
the end of the dosing period.  An extended dosing 
period did not increase the severity of lesions, and the 
pulmonary finding in monkeys observed at 30 mg/kg 
showed reversibility after the 3-month recovery 
period.   
Released drug: 
No pulmonary toxicity was observed in studies of the 
released drug in rats or monkeys.

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Abnormal renal function was seen in rats but 
not in monkeys in nonclinical studies with T-
DXd. 
Histopathological changes at only 
supratherapeutic doses of T-DXd were 
observed in both rats and monkeys.  No renal 
toxicity was observed with the released drug.  
No safety concern with renal function from 
clinical studies with T-DXd has been 
identified.  However, TEAEs of Blood 
creatinine increased were observed with a 
higher incidence (4.3% vs 1.1%) in the T-
DXd arm than in the T-DM1 comparator arm 
in Study DS8201-A-U302 and, therefore, 
Blood creatinine increased is listed as an 
ADR in the SmPC. 
Based on the histopathological changes found 
in rats and monkeys as well as renal toxicity 
observed in rats, renal toxicity is a potential 
risk, but is not considered an important 
potential risk for inclusion in the RMP 
(Section SVII.1.1). 
Nonclinical findings related to skin toxicity 
such as changes in the hair follicles and 
epidermis were seen in studies with rats and 
monkeys.  The changes in the hair follicles 
seen in nonclinical studies may be associated 
with the alopecia observed in clinical studies.   
Rash (which includes rash, rash pustular and 
rash maculopapular) and hyperpigmentation 
are considered identified risks for T-DXd; 
however, they are not considered important 
risks for inclusion in the RMP 
(Section SVII.1.1).  
Renal toxicity:  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In the rat 6-week study of T-DXd (q3w dosing), 
abnormalities in renal function were observed.  
Urinalysis revealed proteinuria at ≥60 mg/kg.  Blood 
chemistry indicated increases in urea nitrogen, 
inorganic phosphorus, creatinine, and potassium and 
decreases in sodium and chloride at 197 mg/kg.  
Histopathological changes such as tubular basophilia 
and hyaline casts in the kidney were noted at 
≥60 mg/kg.  All findings in rats resolved after a 
9-week recovery period.  In the monkey 3-month 
study with T-DXd (q3w dosing), while anisokaryosis 
in the proximal tubules in the kidney was observed at 
30 mg/kg at the end of dosing and the 3-month 
recovery periods, no findings suggestive of 
abnormalities in renal function were observed in 
urinalysis or blood chemistry. 
Released drug: 
No renal toxicity was observed in studies of the 
released drug in rats or monkeys. 
Skin toxicity:  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In the rat 6-week intermittent-dose (q3w dosing) 
toxicity study of T-DXd, trauma and/or crust at 
≥20 mg/kg and sparse fur and/or loss of fur at 
197 mg/kg were observed.  In histopathological 
examinations, single-cell necrosis in the hair follicles, 
ulcer, crust, epidermal thickening, and/or fibrosis and 
inflammatory cell infiltration in the dermis were 
observed at ≥60 mg/kg.  All the findings in the skin in 
rats resolved after a 9-week recovery period.  In the 
monkey 3-month study with T-DXd (q3w dosing), 
single-cell necrosis in the hair follicles in the skin at 
≥10 mg/kg and epidermal pigmentation at ≥30 mg/kg 
were noted.  At the end of the 3-month recovery 
period, single-cell necrosis in the hair follicles 
resolved, whereas epidermal pigmentation persisted.   
Released drug: 
No skin toxicity was observed in studies of the 
released drug in rats or monkeys.

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Nonclinical studies in monkeys suggested 
transient increases in ALT and AST without 
histopathological changes in the liver with T-
DXd and released drug.  Increases in ALT 
and AST have been observed in clinical 
studies, with no confirmed case of Hy’s law.  
AST increased and ALT increased are 
considered identified risks for T-DXd but are 
not considered important for inclusion in this 
RMP (Section SVII.1.1).   
Hepatotoxicity:  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In the 6-week intermittent IV dose (q3w dosing) 
toxicity study of T-DXd in monkeys, transient 
increases in AST and ALT at ≥10 mg/kg were 
observed, while no histopathological findings were 
observed in the liver.  In the 3-month monkey study 
(q3w dosing), elevations of enzymes (AST, lactate 
dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase) that did not 
accompany histopathological changes in the liver were 
observed in monkeys receiving 30 mg/kg T-DXd.  
These increases in the enzymes were not considered to 
be significant toxicological changes. 
Released drug: 
In the 4-week intermittent dose (once-weekly dosing) 
study of the released drug in monkeys, single-cell 
necrosis in hepatocytes accompanied by increases in 
AST and ALT were observed at the highest dose 
(12 mg/kg).

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Cardiotoxicity: 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
A 6-week or 3-month administration of T-DXd caused 
no histopathological changes in the heart in rats and 
monkeys.  In the 6-week intermittent IV dose (q3w 
dosing; 3 animals/sex/group to 5 animals/sex/group) 
study of T-DXd in monkeys, ECG parameter changes 
(slight QTc prolongation; a change of approximately 
14%) were found in 1 animal in the 78.8 mg/kg group 
(5 animals/sex).  No abnormalities in ECG parameters, 
cardiac function tests (LVEF, etc), or cardiac troponin 
I levels were found in the 3-month intermittent dosing 
study in monkeys.  In the safety pharmacology study, 
T-DXd had no effect on the cardiovascular parameters 
(blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG) at doses of up to 
78.8 mg/kg when a single IV dose was administered to 
male monkeys.   
Released drug: 
In the 4-week intermittent-dose (once-weekly dosing) 
study of the released drug in rats and monkeys, 
myocardial cell degeneration/necrosis was observed in 
a moribund cynomolgus monkey at a dose level of 
12 mg/kg.  In hERG studies, the released drug did not 
show inhibition of the hERG channel current. 
Ocular toxicity: 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In the intermittent IV dosing studies of T-DXd (q3w 
dosing for 6 weeks or 3 months), ocular toxicity was 
not found at doses up to the highest dose (78.8 mg/kg 
in cynomolgus monkeys, 197 mg/kg in rats). 
Released drug: 
In the 4-week intermittent-dose (once-weekly dosing) 
study of the released drug in rats and monkeys, 
single-cell necrosis in the corneal epithelium was seen 
at ≥3 mg/kg in rats and at 12 mg/kg in monkeys.  The 
finding resolved after the 4-week recovery period.   
Nonclinical studies suggested a potential 
effect on QT interval with T-DXd and 
released drug.  QT was routinely monitored 
through ECG in clinical studies with T-DXd.  
A study to evaluate the effect of T-DXd 6.4 
mg/kg on QTc confirmed no clinically 
meaningful impact on the QTc interval.  
Therefore, QT prolongation is not considered 
a risk for inclusion in this RMP.  
Nonclinical studies suggested a potential for 
adverse corneal effects with only the released 
drug.  Vision blurred is an identified risk for 
T-DXd but is not considered an important 
risk.  Keratitis is a potential risk for T-DXd 
but is not considered an important risk for 
inclusion in this RMP (Section SVII.1.1).

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity and 
genotoxicity: 
Since embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies 
are not warranted for drugs that are genotoxic and 
target rapidly dividing cells, embryo-foetal 
developmental toxicity studies were not conducted in 
accordance with the ICH S9.  
Trastuzumab deruxtecan: 
In the 6-week intermittent-dose study of T-DXd in 
rats, small-sized testes and epididymides that 
accompanied reduced organ weights were observed at 
197 mg/kg.  Histopathological findings in rats 
included spermatid retention at 20 mg/kg and 60 
mg/kg, and tubular degeneration/atrophy in the testes 
accompanying secondary changes of luminal cell 
debris and reduced sperm in the epididymis at 
197 mg/kg.  The changes produced at 197 mg/kg did 
not recover by the end of the 9-week recovery period.  
In the 6-week and 3-month intermittent-dose studies 
of T-DXd in cynomolgus monkeys, decreased 
numbers of round spermatids in the Stage V to VI 
seminiferous tubule in the testes was observed at 
≥30 mg/kg.  These changes in the testes of monkeys 
showed reversibility. 
Released drug: 
There was no testicular toxicity in studies in rats and 
monkeys with the released drug.   
In vitro genotoxicity studies of the released drug 
indicated that this drug had no potential to induce gene 
mutation in bacteria but had the potential to induce 
structural chromosome aberrations in mammalian 
cultured cells.  An in vivo micronucleus study in bone 
marrow of rats indicated that the released drug had the 
potential to induce micronuclei. 
Carcinogenicity: 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in 
accordance with ICH S9. 
Reproductive studies in rats and monkeys 
indicate changes to the reproductive organs of 
males.  
Postmarketing AE reports for trastuzumab 
showed that treatment during pregnancy has 
resulted in oligohydramnios, manifesting as 
fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal 
abnormalities, and neonatal death.  DXd, the 
released drug was genotoxic in an in vitro 
chromosome aberration study with 
mammalian cultured cells and an in vivo 
micronucleus study in rats.  The 
characteristics of trastuzumab and released 
drug indicate that T-DXd can potentially 
cause foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman.  
Embryo-foetal toxicity is considered an 
important potential risk for inclusion in this 
RMP (Section SVII.1.2).  
Testicular toxicity is a potential risk based on 
the findings in animal studies, however it is 
not considered an important potential risk for 
inclusion in the RMP (Section SVII.1.1).

The exposure data presented in this Risk Management Plan (RMP) focus exclusively on subjects 
in Daiichi Sankyo-sponsored studies and do not include subjects in investigator-sponsored 
studies.  
Cumulatively, 2145 subjects were exposed to ≥5.4 mg/kg T-DXd in the following 9 pooled 
studies (Studies DS8201-A-J101, DS8201-A-U201, DS8201-A-J202, DS8201-A-U204,

  Study DS8201-A-J202, hereafter referred to as Study J202, was a Phase 2, multicentre, 
open-label study in subjects with HER2-expressing advanced gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma (169 subjects treated; data cut-off date: 03 Jun 2020).  
  Study DS8201-A-U204, hereafter referred to as Study U204, was a Phase 2, multicentre, 
open-label, 2-cohort study for HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated, unresectable 
and/or metastatic NSCLC (181 subjects treated; data cut-off date: 03 Dec 2021). 
  Study DS8201-A-U205, hereafter referred to as Study U205, was a Phase 2, open-label, 
single-arm study in HER2-positive, unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma subjects who have progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing 
regimen (79 subjects treated; data cut-off date: 08 Nov 2021). 
  Study DS8201-A-U206, hereafter referred to as Study U206, is a Phase 2, multicentre, 
randomised, 2-arm study in HER2-mutant NSCLC subjects who had disease recurrence 
or progression during/after at least 1 regimen of prior anticancer therapy (second-line or 
later) that must have contained a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the 
metastatic/locally advanced setting (151 subjects, of whom 101 were treated with 
5.4 mg/kg T-DXd and 50 were treated with 6.4 mg/kg T-DXd; interim analysis data 
cut-off date: 24 Mar 2022). 
  Study DS8201-A-U301, hereafter referred to as Study U301, was a Phase 3, multicenter, 
open-label, active-controlled study for HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic 
breast cancer subjects previously treated with T-DM1 (608 subjects, of whom 404 
subjects were treated with 5.4 mg/kg T-DXd; data-cut-off date: 30 Jun 2022).

  Study DS8201-A-U302, hereafter referred to as Study U302, was a Phase 3, multicentre, 
open-label, active-controlled study in subjects with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or 
metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane (518 subjects, of 
whom 257 were treated with T-DXd; data cut-off date: 25 Jul 2022).  
  Study DS8201-A-U303, hereafter referred to as Study U303, was a Phase 3, multicentre, 
open-label, active-controlled study for HER2-low, unresectable and/or metastatic breast 
cancer subjects (543 subjects, of whom 371 subjects were treated with T-DXd; data 
cut-off date: 11 Apr 2022). 
The median duration of exposure among subjects within these 9 studies split into 5 pools (ie, 
5.4 mg/kg [BC]; 5.4 mg/kg [NSCLC]; 5.4 mg/kg [ATT]; 6.4 mg/kg [GC]; 6.4 mg/kg [ATT]) is 
presented in Table Part II: Module SIII.1. 
For the purpose of this RMP, the overall pool of 2145 subjects treated with ≥5.4 mg/kg in the 
variety of tumour types (ie, the All Tumour Types [ATT] ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool) is referred to as 
“ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool”.  The number of subjects split by age group and sex across the 5 pools is 
presented in Table Part II: Module SIII.2 and Table Part II: Module SIII.3, while the number of 
subjects split by ethnic origin, race, and geographic distribution is presented in Table Part II:

PART II: MODULE SIV  POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS 
SIV.1  Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme 
The following were key exclusion criteria from the 9 pooled studies in the ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg 
Pool: 
Age less than the years of maturity (eg, <18 years in the US and EU, <20 years in Japan 
and Korea) 
Reason for exclusion:  
Conditions under study are rare in paediatric patients and therefore not relevant to study.   
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
These patients are not relevant for the current proposed indications.   
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2 
Reason for exclusion:  
Cancer patients with poor performance status are excluded before safety and efficacy of a 
product are confirmed in patients with good PS.  The inclusion criterion was limited to Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0 or 1 in order to monitor whether the drug has a negative 
effect on PS.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
There is no evidence to suggest that the safety profile in these patients is different from that of 
the population intended for treatment. 
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B or C infection 
Reason for exclusion:  
To maximise subject safety during the conduct of these studies, subjects with known HIV or 
active Hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from participation in the clinical programme 
because of the potential for drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Rationale:  
There was no clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction with ritonavir or itraconazole in Study 
DS8201-A-A104 in subjects with HER2-expressing advanced solid malignant tumours (ie, 
minimal increase in exposure and no change in the safety profile).  No differences are expected 
between subjects with HER2+ and HER2-low BC with respect to drug-drug interactions.  No 
additional safety concerns are anticipated if the product is used in these patient populations.  
Therefore, the use of T-DXd in patients with pre-existing HIV or active Hepatitis B/C is not 
considered missing information.  
Pre-existing severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) 
Reason for exclusion:  
Subjects with severe renal impairment were excluded from participation in the clinical 
programme before the safety profile was established in subjects without severe renal impairment. 
One subject in Study J101 and 1 subject in Study U204 met the CrCL criteria for severe renal 
impairment on the first day of the first cycle prior to dosing; however, the subject was enrolled 
meeting the CrCL criteria for moderate renal impairment at screening. Another subject in Study 
U204 was enrolled meeting the CrCL criteria for severe renal impairment at screening and CrCL 
values remained on the same level over the course of 20 cycles of treatment.  In Study U303, 1 
subject meeting the CrCL criteria for severe renal impairment was enrolled at screening and 
discontinued study drug after the first cycle because of worsening hepatic failure while severe 
renal impairment persisted. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
The major excretion pathway of T-DXd, as observed in a rat study, was primarily through faeces 
via the biliary route with minimal renal excretion.  In addition, based on the population PK 
analysis for mild and moderate renal impairment and data from nonclinical studies, a different 
safety profile is not expected in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment  
Reason for exclusion:  
A potential effect of impaired hepatic function on T-DXd elimination and exposure is possible.  
The inclusion criteria related to hepatic impairment were not identical among the 9 studies but 
allowed for inclusion of subjects with baseline moderate hepatic impairment.   
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No  
Rationale: 
Further data for PK and safety were collected in 12 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment at 
baseline from clinical studies across different indications including both doses of 5.4 and 
6.4 mg/kg.  Data in these 12 subjects did not reveal a significant difference in PK and safety in 
comparison to subjects with normal hepatic function at baseline.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Pre-existing severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin >3.0 × upper limit of 
normal [ULN] and any AST regardless of Gilbert Syndrome) 
Reason for exclusion:  
A potential effect of impaired hepatic function on T-DXd elimination and exposure is possible.  
This patient population was excluded before safety and efficacy data were established in patients 
without severe hepatic impairment.   
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
Yes 
History of myocardial infarction (MI), recent troponin levels consistent with MI, or recent 
unstable angina  
Reason for exclusion:  
Cardiotoxicity has been observed with anti-HER2 drugs, including trastuzumab, which has a 
warning for cardiomyopathy.  A nonclinical study in monkeys has shown myocardial cell 
degeneration/necrosis at supratherapeutic doses (not tested in humans) with the released drug of 
T-DXd. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
Clinical data do not support an association between T-DXd and cardiotoxicity manifesting as 
ischemic cardiac events such as MI.  This lack of cardiac liability suggests that the safety profile 
in this population would not be different from that of the indicated population and it is, therefore, 
not relevant for inclusion as missing information.   
Left ventricular ejection fraction <50% or recent symptomatic congestive heart failure 
Reason for exclusion:  
Cardiotoxicity has been observed with anti-HER2 drugs, including trastuzumab, which has a 
warning for cardiomyopathy.  A nonclinical study in monkeys with T-DXd did not show an 
abnormality in cardiac function tests (including LVEF).  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
Left ventricular dysfunction is an important identified risk for T-DXd as described in SmPC 
Section 4.4 and 4.8.  Additional information on this risk is included in Section SVII.3.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
QTcF >470 msec (female) or >450 msec (male) or recent serious cardiac arrhythmia 
requiring treatment 
Reason for exclusion:  
A nonclinical study in monkeys has shown a slight corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s 
formula (QTcF) prolongation at supratherapeutic doses of  T-DXd (not tested in humans). 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
No clinically meaningful association between QT prolongation and the use of T-DXd was 
observed in a study to evaluate QT effects (Study DS8201-A-J102).  This result is consistent 
with the clinical data from the 9 completed studies.  As there is no signal of QT liability with 
T-DXd, there is no evidence to suggest the safety profile in this population is different from that 
of the general target population. 
History of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) requiring steroid treatment or active or 
suspected ILD 
Reason for exclusion:  
Nonclinical studies in monkeys have shown changes in the lung, such as focal interstitial 
inflammation and alveolar oedema, at supratherapeutic doses of T-DXd (not tested in humans).  
Patients with a history of ILD may be at an increased risk of recurrence and, therefore, may be 
associated with worse outcomes.  In order to minimise the potential risk to patients in the clinical 
programme, these patients were excluded.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
ILD/pneumonitis is an important identified risk for T-DXd and is described in SmPC Section 
4.2, SmPC Section 4.4 and SmPC Section 4.8.  Additional information on this risk is included in 
Section SVII.3.   
Use of OATP1B inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors  
Reason for exclusion:  
In an in vitro study, cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 was identified as the primary CYP enzyme in 
the metabolism of the released drug of T-DXd.  The released drug is also a substrate for organic 
anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 40 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Rationale:  
Based on a drug-drug interaction study (Study DS8201-A-A104), concomitant use of OATP1B 
inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with T-DXd resulted in a small increase in area under the 
curve that was not considered to be clinically meaningful.  
Clinically significant corneal disease (Study U201 only) 
Reason for exclusion:  
In a nonclinical study of the released drug of T-DXd, single-cell necrosis in the corneal 
epithelium was observed in rats and monkeys at supratherapeutic doses (not tested in humans).   
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
Corneal events observed in clinical studies with T-DXd were primarily keratitis.  The majority of 
keratitis events in the All Tumour Types ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity; 
2 (0.1%) of the subjects experienced Grade 3 keratitis and 1 (0.1%) of the subjects experienced 
Grade 3 ulcerative keratitis.  Dose reduction was required in 1 (0.1%) subject who had Grade 3 
keratitis.  None of the events was associated with drug discontinuation, and all events could be 
managed through standard clinical practice.  Keratitis is classified as a potential risk for T-DXd; 
however, it is not considered important.  There is no evidence to suggest that the safety profile in 
subjects with corneal disease would differ from that of the general indicated population and it is 
therefore not relevant for inclusion as missing information. 
Pregnant or lactating women and women and men of reproductive/childbearing potential 
who do not use a highly effective form of contraception or abstinence 
Reason for exclusion:  
Trastuzumab, a HER2 receptor antagonist, has postmarketing case reports of oligohydramnios 
manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death during 
pregnancy.  Additionally, based on nonclinical findings from reproductive/developmental and 
genotoxicity studies of T-DXd in rats and monkeys and its mechanism of action as a 
topoisomerase I inhibitor, the released drug of T-DXd may cause embryo-foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman (SmPC Section 4.4 and SmPC Section 4.6). 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
Embryo-foetal toxicity is considered an important potential risk and testicular toxicity is 
considered a potential risk for T-DXd.  Additional information on the risk of embryo-foetal 
toxicity is included in Section SVII.3.   
SmPC Section 4.6 advises that women of childbearing potential and men with female partners of 
childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment and that 
women should discontinue breastfeeding prior to initiating treatment.  Exposure in these

populations is therefore not expected, and so they are not relevant for inclusion as missing 
information. 
Clinically active brain metastases (symptomatic and untreated or requiring treatment) 
Reason for exclusion:  
This population was excluded from the T-DXd clinical development programme based on 
concerns of poor functional status and shortened life expectancy.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?   
No 
Rationale:  
This population was excluded to avoid factors that may confound understanding of the safety 
profile and efficacy of T-DXd and to ensure appropriate interpretation of the safety data.  There 
is no evidence to suggest that the safety profile in this population would be different from that of 
the general indicated population and it is therefore not relevant for inclusion as missing 
information.  
SIV.2  Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial 
Development Programme 
The clinical development programme for T-DXd is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse 
reactions, such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused 
by prolonged or cumulative exposure.  
With 2145 subjects in the ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool, there is at least a 99.9% chance of observing 
Aes with a true incidence rate of 1% or higher. 
SIV.3  Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented 
in the Clinical Trial Development Programme

PART II: MODULE SV  POSTAUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE 
SV.1 
Postauthorisation Exposure 
T-DXd was approved for marketing in the US on 20 Dec 2019; it was first made available to 
patients on 31 Dec 2019.  It was also approved by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor, and 
Welfare (MHLW) on 25 Mar 2020 and since 18 Jan 2021 in the EU.  Furthermore, T-DXd is 
also approved in over 40 countries.  
SV.1.1  Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
The postmarketing patient exposure in patient-years was estimated by (a) counting numbers of 
vials sold by MAH warehouses (b) further assuming average adult bodyweight in the approved 
country (eg. 4.3 vials are used in 1 infusion in US, 3.4 vials per infusion in Japan), and (c) 
multiplying the number of infusions by 21 days, divided by 365 days/year, to account for the 
administration of an infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle).   
Exposure 
SV.1.2 
Cumulatively, since the first approval of T-DXd on 20 Dec 2019 through 19 Dec 2022, there 
were 1,198,846 vials of T-DXd sold from MAH warehouses worldwide.  Based on the average 
body weight of adults in the countries where the product is marketed, it is estimated that 
297,363 infusions were administered.  Considering that an infusion of T-DXd is administered 
once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) and 17.3 cycles per year, the estimated cumulative patient 
exposure through 19 Dec 2022 was 17,108.3 patient-years. 
PART II: MODULE SVI  ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Potential for transmission of infectious agents  
The risk of transmission of infectious agents by this product is considered negligible based on 
product design, manufacturing process, facility design and controls, and current testing 
programmes.  European Pharmacopoeia standards have been met. 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
T-DXd does not contain any substances that have the potential for misuse for illegal purposes.

SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
SVII.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP 
SVII.1.1.1 Identified Risks 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but considered to be acceptable in 
relation to the severity of the treated indication include the following:  gastrointestinal (GI) 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs), rash, alopecia, cough, dizziness, dry eye, dyspnoea, epistaxis, 
fatigue, headache, infusion-related reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, AST increased, 
ALT increased, hypokalaemia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and 
neutropenia including febrile neutropenia (see individual descriptions below).  All these events 
are recognized ADRs for T-DXd and are included in SmPC Section 4.8.   
Identified Risk: Gastrointestinal ADRs 
Preferred terms in the identified risk of gastrointestinal ADRs were reported at the following 
frequencies in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool: nausea (187 [79.9%] subjects), vomiting 
(114 [48.7%]), constipation (84 [35.9%]), decreased appetite (81 [34.6%]), diarrhoea 
(72 [30.8%]), abdominal pain (46 [19.7%]), stomatitis (35 [15.0%]), and dyspepsia (33 [14.1%]).  
The highest frequency of drug interruption and dose reduction due to a GI event was from 
nausea:  4 (1.7%) subjects and 8 (3.4%) subjects, respectively.  Only 1 subject had a GI event 
(diarrhoea) that led to drug discontinuation.  Although frequent, GI events were generally 
nonserious and generally Grade 1 to 2 in severity.  
Identified Risk:  Rash 
Events of rash (grouped term that includes preferred terms [PTs] of rash, rash pustular, and rash 
maculo-papular) were reported in 30 (12.8%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  
Although frequent, events of rash were all nonserious and generally Grade 1 in severity, leading 
to drug interruption in 1 subject and to no dose reduction or drug discontinuation.   
Identified Risk: Alopecia 
Events of alopecia were reported in 108 (46.2%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool.  Although frequent, events of alopecia were nonserious and generally Grade 1 in severity, 
with no drug interruption, dose reduction, or drug discontinuation.   
Identified Risk: Cough 
Events of cough were reported in 50 (21.4%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  
Although frequent, events of cough were nonserious and generally Grade 1 in severity, leading to 
drug interruption in 1 (0.4%) subject and to discontinuation of study drug in 1 (0.4%) subject, 
with no dose reductions. 
Identified Risk: Dizziness 
Events of dizziness were reported in 25 (10.7%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool.  Although frequent, events of dizziness were nonserious and generally Grade 1 in severity, 
with no drug interruption, dose reduction, or drug discontinuation.

Identified Risk: Dry Eye 
Events of dry eye were reported in 27 (11.5%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool.  Although frequent, events of dry eye were generally nonserious and Grade 1 in severity, 
except in 1 subject who had a Grade 4 event that improved to Grade 1 without requiring 
intervention and did not recur.  No event of dry eye led to drug interruption, dose reduction, or 
drug discontinuation.   
Identified Risk: Dyspnoea 
Events of dyspnoea were reported in 34 (14.5%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool.  Although frequent, events of dyspnoea were generally nonserious (1 subject had dyspnoea 
reported as a serious AE (SAE) and generally Grade 1 to 2 in severity, leading to no dose 
reduction, to drug interruption in 2 (0.9%) subjects (both with dyspnoea) and to drug 
discontinuation in 1 subject who had drug discontinued due to concurrent dyspnoea and 
pneumonitis.  
Identified Risk: Epistaxis 
Events of epistaxis were reported in 33 (14.1%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool.  Although frequent, events of epistaxis were all nonserious and generally Grade 1 in 
severity, with no drug interruption, dose reduction or drug discontinuation.   
Identified Risk: Fatigue 
Events of fatigue (grouped term that includes PTs of fatigue and asthenia) were reported in 141 
(60.3%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Although frequent, all events of 
fatigue were nonserious and generally Grade 1 to 2 in severity.  Dose was reduced in 9 (3.8%) 
subjects and drug was interrupted in 5 (2.1%) subjects.  No events of fatigue led to drug 
discontinuation.   
Identified Risk: Headache 
Events of headache (grouped term that includes PTs of headache, sinus headache, and migraine) 
were reported in 47 (20.1%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Although 
frequent, events of headache were all nonserious and Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  No event led to 
drug interruption, dose reduction, or drug discontinuation in any subject.   
Identified Risk: Infusion-related Reaction  
Events of infusion-related reaction (a grouped term comprising 14 PTs, including 
infusion-related reaction [4 events], flushing [1 event], and hypersensitivity [1 event]) were 
reported in 6 (2.6%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Events of 
infusion-related reaction were generally nonserious (1 subject had hypersensitivity reported as an 
SAE), and all were Grade 2 in severity, leading to no dose reduction or drug discontinuation in 
any subject and to drug interruption in 1 subject (PT of infusion-related reaction).  
Identified Risk: Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 
Events of upper respiratory tract infection (grouped term that includes PTs of influenza, 
influenza-like illness, and upper respiratory tract infection) were reported in 43 (18.4%) subjects 
in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Although frequent, all events of upper respiratory

tract infection were nonserious, and generally Grade 1 to 2 in severity, leading to no dose 
reduction or drug discontinuation in any subject and to drug interruption in 7 (3.0%) subjects.   
Identified Risk: Aspartate Aminotransferase Increased and Alanine Aminotransferase 
Increased 
Events of AST increased were reported in 35 (15.0%) subjects and events of ALT increased were 
reported in 25 (10.7%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Although frequent, 
events of AST increased and ALT increased are consistent with laboratory-based increases in 
AST and ALT, all events were nonserious, and events were generally Grade 1 in severity, 
transient, and reversible, and did not lead to drug discontinuation.  One (0.4%) subject had drug 
interruption due to ALT increase; 1 (0.4%) subject had dose reduction due to ALT increased and 
1 (0.4%) due to AST increased.  One subject had values that met the biochemical criteria for 
potential Hy’s Law (ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN).  This case of 
potential Hy’s Law was determined not to be causally associated with study drug due to 
alternative aetiology (acute hepatitis B ongoing from baseline) at the time of occurrence of the 
event.   
Identified Risk: Hypokalaemia 
Events of hypokalaemia were reported in 30 (12.8%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 
5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Events of hypokalaemia were consistent with laboratory-based decreases in 
potassium.  Although frequent, events of hypokalaemia were reported as Grade 1 in 21 (9.0%) 
subjects, Grade 2 in 1 (0.4%) subject, and Grade 3 in 8 (3.4%) subjects; with 3 (1.3%) subjects 
having hypokalaemia reported as an SAE.  Two (0.9%) subjects had drug interruption due to 
hypokalaemia, with no subjects having dose reduction or drug discontinuation. 
Identified Risk: Anaemia 
Events of anaemia (grouped term that includes PTs of anaemia, haemoglobin decreased, red 
blood cell count decreased, and haematocrit decreased) were reported in 79 (33.8%) subjects in 
the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Events of anaemia were consistent with laboratory-
based decreases in haemoglobin count.  Although frequent, events in only 2 (0.9%) subjects were 
reported as SAEs.  The majority of events were Grade 1 to 2 in severity, with 21 (9.0%) subjects 
reported as having anaemia events ≥Grade 3.  Events led to drug interruption in 8 (3.4%) 
subjects and dose reduction in 1 (0.4%) subject, with no drug discontinuation in any subject.  
Identified Risk: Thrombocytopenia 
Events of thrombocytopenia (grouped term that includes PTs of platelet count decreased and 
thrombocytopenia) were reported in 54 (23.1%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool.  Events of thrombocytopenia were consistent with laboratory-based decreases in platelet 
count.  Although frequent, events were generally Grade 1 to 2 in severity, with 10 (4.3%) 
subjects reported as having thrombocytopenia events of Grade 3.  Events led to drug interruption 
in 6 (2.6%) subjects, dose reduction in 2 (0.9%) subjects, and drug discontinuation in 2 (0.9%)

Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
subjects.  One (0.4%) subject had an event reported as an SAE.  No event was associated with 
major bleeding. 
Identified Risk: Leukopenia 
Events of leukopenia (grouped term that includes PTs of white blood cell (WBC) count 
decreased and leukopenia) were reported in 48 (20.5%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 
5.4 mg/kg Pool.  Events of white blood cell count decrease were consistent with laboratory-based 
decreases in WBC count.  Although frequent, events were all nonserious and generally Grade 1 
to 2 in severity, leading to drug interruption in 7 (0.3%) subjects and dose reduction in 1 (0.4%) 
subject, with no drug discontinuation in any subject.  
Identified Risk: Lymphopenia 
Events of lymphopenia (grouped term that includes PTs of lymphocyte count decreased and 
lymphopenia) were reported in 26 (11.1%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  
Events of lymphopenia were consistent with laboratory-based decreases.  Although frequent, 
events were all nonserious and generally Grade 1 to 2 in severity, leading to dose reduction in 
1 (0.4%) subject, with no drug discontinuation or interruption in any subject. 
Identified Risk: Neutropenia, Including Febrile Neutropenia 
Events of neutropenia (grouped term) were reported in 76 (32.5%) subjects (observed in the 
HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool; however, these events were generally nonserious (1 [0.4%] 
subject had an SAE), did not require drug discontinuation, and were not associated with fatal 
outcomes. Laboratory data were consistent with the reported Aes of neutropenia (grouped term). 
Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4 (1.7%) subjects in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, 
did not require drug discontinuation, and was not associated with fatal outcomes.  
One subject had PTs of Grade 3 neutrophil count decrease and Grade 3 febrile neutropenia 
reported concurrently with a serious event of Grade 4 sepsis.  The event of sepsis resolved 
following treatment with antibiotics.  No other subjects with an event of Grade ≥3 neutropenia 
(grouped term) or Grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia had a concurrent serious infection.   
Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, is generally manageable through standard clinical 
practice and following dose modification guidelines (SmPC Section 4.2).

Potential Risks 
Risks With Minimal Clinical Impact on Patients: Keratitis 
Corneal toxicity was observed in a nonclinical study of the released drug of T-DXd and has been 
seen in drugs in similar class.  The mechanism for corneal toxicity with T-DXd remains unclear; 
however, it is known that HER2 is expressed in corneal epithelia.  Keratitis was observed in 
clinical studies with T-DXd.  In the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, keratitis was reported in 
6 (2.6%) subjects, punctate keratitis in 2 (0.9%) subjects, and ulcerative keratitis in 1 (0.4%) 
subject.  All events of keratitis were nonserious and either Grade 1 or 2 in severity, leading to 
drug interruption in 1 (0.4%) subject and to no dose reduction or drug discontinuation.

Risks With Minimal Clinical Impact on Patients: Testicular Toxicity 
Reproductive studies in rats and monkeys indicate changes to the reproductive organs of males 
(eg, spermatid retention, small-sized testes and epididymides accompanying reduced organ 
weights; tubular degeneration/atrophy in the testes, luminal cell debris and reduced sperm in the 
epididymides) with T-DXd.  It is not known whether T-DXd or its metabolites are found in 
seminal fluid.  The potential risk for male patients is further minimized by statements in SmPC 
Section 4.6 advising male patients to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment 
and male patients must not freeze or donate sperm throughout the treatment period, and for at 
least 4 months after the final dose of T-DXd. 
Risks With Minimal Clinical Impact on Patients: Renal Toxicity 
In nonclinical studies with T-DXd abnormal renal function was seen in rats but not in monkeys.  
In the rat 6-week study of T-DXd (q3w dosing), abnormalities in renal function were observed.  
At a supratherapeutic dose urinalysis revealed proteinuria and blood chemistry indicated 
increases in urea nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus, creatinine, and potassium and decreases in 
sodium and chloride.  Supratherapeutic doses of T-DXd were observed in both rats and monkeys.  
At supratherapeutic doses, histopathological changes such as tubular basophilia and hyaline casts 
in the kidney were noted and all findings in rats resolved after a 9-week recovery period.  In the 
monkey 3-month study while anisokaryosis in the proximal tubules in the kidney was observed 
at 30 mg/kg at the end of dosing and the 3-month recovery periods, no findings suggestive of 
abnormalities in renal function were observed in urinalysis or blood chemistry.  No renal toxicity 
was observed in studies of the released drug in rats or monkeys. 
In the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool, no clinically meaningful shifts to worse creatinine 
values were observed. 2 (0.9%) subjects reported a TEAE of blood creatinine increase in the 
HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool.  No subject in the pool had ≥Grade 3 serum creatinine 
increase, except for 1 subject (U201 Subject No. 10130001) who had fatal events of acute 
hepatic failure and acute renal injury 34 days after last study drug dose.  Both events were 
assessed by the investigator as being due to disease progression (liver metastases).  Overall, no 
safety concern with renal function from clinical studies or during postmarketing period with 
T-DXd has been identified.  
SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the 
RMP  
Important identified risks are: ILD/pneumonitis and left ventricular dysfunction.  Important 
potential risks include embryo-foetal toxicity and product confusion-related medication errors.  
SVII.1.2.1 
Important Identified Risks 
Important Identified Risk: Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis 
Benefit-risk impact: 
All data presented in this section are for “adjudicated drug-related ILD,” which is defined as 
events that were adjudicated as ILD and as related to trastuzumab deruxtecan (regardless of the 
determination made by the investigator) by an independent, multidisciplinary Adjudication 
Committee (AC).   
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 49 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
The incidence of adjudicated ILD in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool was 32 (13.7%) 
subjects, with 12 (5.1%) subjects having events reported as serious.  
Events of ILD were adjudicated to be Grade 1 in 6 (2.6%) subjects, Grade 2 in 19 (8.1%), Grade 
3 in 1 (0.4%), Grade 4 in 0 (%), and Grade 5 in 6 (2.6%).  These 6 Grade 5 events were 
adjudicated as ILD associated with a fatal outcome (including 4 subjects from the EU).   
Drug was interrupted in 6 (2.6%) subjects, dose was reduced in 4 (1.7%), and drug was 
discontinued in 22 (9.4%) subjects.  Among the 32 subjects with adjudicated drug-related ILD 
events, the reported outcome was resolved in 8 (25.0%) subjects, recovered with sequelae in 1  
(3.1%), recovering in 2 (6.3%), not recovered in 13 (40.6%), fatal in 6 (18.8%), and 
missing/unknown in 2 (6.3%). 
ILD/pneumonitis requires appropriate monitoring and management to mitigate the risk of Grade 
4 or Grade 5 events, which have the potential to impact the benefit-risk for the patient.  The risk 
of ILD/pneumonitis is further characterised in Section SVII.3.1.  
Important Identified Risk: Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
Benefit-risk impact: 
The incidence of the PT of Ejection fraction decreased in the HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool 
was 3 (1.3%) subjects, with no events reported as serious.  The events were Grade 2 in 2 (0.9%) 
subjects and Grade 3 in 1 (0.4%) subject.   
Study drug was interrupted in all 3 (1.3%) subjects, with no dose reductions or discontinuations 
of study drug due to ejection fraction   decreased.  
Left ventricular dysfunction is characterised in Section SVII.3.1.  
Because the lack of a control group in available clinical data does not allow to rule out 
completely a causal association with T-DXd, and cardiac failure has been reported for drugs in 
similar class, left ventricular dysfunction is considered an important identified risk.  Appropriate 
monitoring and management is required to mitigate the risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which 
has the potential to impact the benefit-risk for the patient.   
SVII.1.2.2 
Important Potential Risks 
Important Potential Risk: Embryo-Foetal Toxicity 
Benefit-risk impact: 
Nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity data for T-DXd are described in 
Section Part II: Module SII.  
No clinical data on the effect of T-DXd on embryo-foetal toxicity potential are available.  
However, in postmarketing reports, the use of trastuzumab, a HER2 receptor antagonist, during 
pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, 
skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.  Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of 
action, the released drug of T-DXd can also cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman (SmPC Section 4.4 and SmPC Section 4.6).  Appropriate contraception as 
described in the SmPC is required to mitigate the risk of pregnancy, which could impact the 
benefit-risk of the drug.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Important Potential Risk: Product confusion-related medication errors 
Benefit-risk impact:  
With the availability of other trastuzumab-containing products and the HER2-targeted ADC 
trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), prescribers could potentially mix up trastuzumab-containing 
products if they do not use the tradename.  There is a potential for serious clinical consequences 
(eg, lack of efficacy) by inadvertently substituting one trastuzumab containing product for 
another. 
For T-DXd there have been no reports of product confusion-related medication errors in clinical 
trials or since marketing of the product in the US and Japan. 
Missing Information:  Use in Patients with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment  
No dedicated hepatic impairment study was conducted.  While patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment were generally excluded from the clinical programme, up to a maximum of 
10 patients with moderate hepatic impairment were eligible for enrolment into Study U201.  
However, only 1 patient meeting these criteria was enrolled.  Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment were excluded from the clinical programme.  
Based on the elimination of trastuzumab via hepatic metabolism, it is unknown whether 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment has an effect on trastuzumab deruxtecan elimination and 
exposure in humans, as well as whether patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
have a safety profile different from that of the general indicated population.  A warning 
statement is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC that administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan 
should be undertaken with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
Collection of PK and safety data from at least 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
from ongoing Phase 2 or 3 clinical studies with trastuzumab deruxtecan is planned. 
Missing Information:  Long-term Safety  
The median treatment duration (defined as date of last dose – date of first dose + 21) in the 
HER2-positive BC 5.4 mg/kg Pool (N = 234) was 9.82 months (range: 0.7 to 37.1).  A total of 
164/234 (70.1%) subjects had been treated for >6 months, 127/234 (54.3%) for >9 months, 
69/234 (29.5%) for >12 months, and 5/234 (2.1%) for >24 months.   
With continuation of currently ongoing Phase 3 studies (Studies DS8201-A-U301 and 
DS8201-A-U302), more long-term safety data will become available, which will be used to 
further characterise cumulative toxicity and the overall safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
SVII.2  New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an 
Updated RMP 
Use in Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment was removed based on the analysis of further 
PK and safety data pertaining to moderate hepatic impairment in subjects administered T-DXd 
addressing the required post-authorization measure (Module 2.5 Clinical Overview Addendum – 
Moderate Hepatic Impairment [Sep 2023]).  
This additional analysis included a total of 12 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment: 
7 BC subjects treated with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg and 1 GC and 4 colorectal cancer subjects treated 
Proprietary and Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
with T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg.  Pharmacokinetic data reveal distinct exposure disparities between 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function or mild 
hepatic impairment.  However, it is important to note that these variations lack clinical 
significance in the approved indication for GC and BC and a definitive conclusion could not be 
drawn. 
The safety data from the additional analysis align with the established safety profile, with no 
emergence of new safety concerns. 
SVII.3  Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and 
Missing Information 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
Important Identified Risk:  Interstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis 
Potential mechanisms: 
The exact underlying mechanism of drug-induced ILD/pneumonitis with T-DXd is unknown.  In 
drugs of similar class for which ILD/pneumonitis has been identified as a risk, 2 types of 
mechanisms have been proposed: chemotherapy that could lead to dose-dependent toxicity via an 
increase in the level of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and direct cytotoxic damage 
and monoclonal antibodies that could lead to an immune-mediated allergic lung injury.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Dose-dependent changes in the lung were seen in nonclinical data.  An independent AC 
adjudicated all potential events of ILD.  Although T-DXd is associated with a risk of 
ILD/pneumonitis and cases with fatal outcomes have been reported, most events have been 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity and manageable following clinical treatment guidelines, which include 
close monitoring signs and symptoms of potential ILD/pneumonitis (eg, cough, fever, and 
dyspnoea) and proactive management with dose modification (dose reduction or interruption), 
and use of steroid treatment and (for moderate, severe or life-threatening ILD/pneumonitis) 
discontinuation of T-DXd. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
ILD data collected in the clinical programme are based on events that the independent ILD AC 
adjudicated as being ILD and as related to T-DXd (regardless of the determination made by the 
investigator). 
ILD in the ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool is summarized by event category and grade in Table Part II: 
Module SVII.3.1, which includes 3 ILD events in Study J101 that occurred >28 days after the 
last dose (TEAE definition), per investigator-reported onset dates. 
Among the 307 of 2145 (14.9%) subjects who had an adjudicated ILD event, 296 (13.8%) 
subjects had events that were adjudicated as drug-related ILD at the following grades: 78 (3.6%) 
Grade 1, 166 (7.7%) Grade 2, 22 (1.0%) Grade 3, 1 (0.0%) Grade 4, and 29 (1.4%) Grade 5 
(Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 1.2.5.1 [U301]).  
Median time to onset date of the first adjudicated drug-related ILD event was 167.0 days (range: 
0 to 960) (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 1.2.5.4 [U301]).

Table 1.2.4.6, and Table 1.2.5.1. 
Among the 296 (13.8%) subjects with events adjudicated as drug-related ILD in the ATT 
≥5.4 mg/kg Pool, per the investigator, 137 (46.3%) recovered, 13 (4.4%) recovered with 
sequelae, 22 (7.4%) were recovering, 95 (32.1%) were not recovered, 21 (7.1%) had a fatal 
outcome, 1 (0.3%) had an event that was ongoing, and 7 (2.4%) were missing outcome 
information (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 1.2.5.4 [U301]).   
The median time to first onset of ILD event was 167 days, and the median duration of the first 
ILD event (as reported by the Investigator) was 47.5 days.  In the ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool, a higher 
incidence of adjudicated drug-related ILD was reported in subjects from Japan (121 [20.6%] 
subjects) compared with the subjects from other countries (175 [11.2%] subjects), and in subjects 
with mild/moderate renal impairment at baseline (172 [15.6%] subjects) compared with subject 
who had normal renal function (120 [11.8%] subjects). This difference was mainly driven by a 
higher number of subjects with Grade 1 and Grade 2 events in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment at baseline (Grade 1: 46 [4.2%] subjects and Grade 2: 96 [8.7%] subjects) (Module 
5.3.5.3 SCS Table 1.4.13 [U301]). 
Spontaneous data from the global safety database up to data lock point (19 Dec 2022): 
The following group of MedDRA PTs have been used to define T-DXd-related ILD in the 
postmarketing setting: Pneumonitis, Interstitial lung disease, Organising pneumonia, and Acute 
interstitial pneumonitis.  By using this approach, a total of 945 cases were identified 
cumulatively.  Of the 945 cases, 107 had a fatal outcome related to ILD, 427 met other 
seriousness criteria, and for 410 cases, ILD was classified as nonserious.  Ages ranged from 27 
years to 90 years (median: 64.0 years) with 68.1% female patients and 16.9% male patients (for 
remaining patients, sex was not reported).  Indications for T-DXd were BC in 64.4% of cases, 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 54 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
GC in 17.4% of cases, and the remaining cases derived from other cancer types (1.5%) and 
unknown indications (14.3%).   
In the majority of cases (68.9%), T-DXd was withdrawn due to the ILD event.  Outcomes 
primarily improved with appropriate ILD management (recovered 25.8%, recovering 20.1%, and 
recovered with sequelae 0.9%).  Reporting rates are different between regions; in particular, the 
ILD reporting rate in Japan is higher because of more intensified reporting in ongoing 
ILD-directed surveys.  Overall, evidence from post-marketing, spontaneous cases does not alter 
the risk of ILD/pneumonitis as observed in clinical studies. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
A stepwise multivariate Cox regression model evaluating the association of baseline factors with 
the time to occurrence of any grade of adjudicated drug-related ILD was conducted among 
1150 subjects who received at least 1 dose of T-DXd (5.4, 6.4, 7.4, or 8.0 mg/kg) in 9 phase 1 or 
2 studies across multiple tumour types.  
Seven baseline factors were potentially associated with increased ILD risk: 
  Patients treated in Japan vs non-Japan 
  Dose of >6.4 mg/kg vs ≤6.4 mg/kg 
  Baseline oxygen saturation <95% vs ≥95% 
  Moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline vs no impairment 
  Presence of lung comorbidities (yes vs no; asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, prior ILD/pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, or 
radiation pneumonitis) 
  Time since initial diagnosis of >4 years vs ≤4 years 
  Age <65 years vs. ≥65 years 
Given the limitations of this analysis (extensive prior treatment, differences in treatment 
durations, preselection of thresholds for Cox multivariate regression based on clinical judgement, 
and heterogeneity of the patient population), the potential clinical risk factors remain to be 
confirmed with future data in a larger, more homogenous patient population. 
Preventability: 
  While the occurrence of some events of ILD/pneumonitis is not completely preventable, 
steps can be taken to prevent events from progressing to a more serious outcome.   
  Patients should be advised to immediately report cough, dyspnoea, fever, and/or any new 
or worsening respiratory symptoms.   
  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis 
(SmPC Section 4.4).   
  Evidence of ILD/pneumonitis should be promptly investigated and patients with 
suspected ILD/pneumonitis should be evaluated by radiographic imaging.  Consultation 
with a pulmonologist should be considered.   
Proprietary and Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
  For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis 
  Corticosteroid treatment (eg, ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) should 
be considered.   
  T-DXd should be withheld until recovery to Grade 0 and may be resumed 
according to instructions in Table 2 of the SmPC Section 4.2.   
  For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater) 
  Corticosteroid treatment (eg, ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) should be 
promptly initiated and continued for at least 14 days  and then gradually tapered 
for at least 4 weeks).   
  T-DXd should be permanently discontinued in patients who are diagnosed with 
any symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) ILD/pneumonitis (SmPC Section 4.2).   
Patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis may be at increased risk of developing 
ILD/pneumonitis (SmPC Section 4.4). Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment should 
be monitored carefully because a higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD has been observed in 
these patients. 
Additional risk minimisation measures that will be implemented will include a Health Care 
Professional (HCP) Guide and a Patient Card (PC) to reinforce early detection of and 
intervention for ILD/pneumonitis cases in clinical practice and thus minimise the occurrence of 
more serious ILD/pneumonitis cases.   
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Although T-DXd is associated with a risk of ILD/pneumonitis and cases with fatal outcomes 
have been reported, most events have been Grade 1 or 2 in severity and manageable following 
clinical treatment guidelines, which include close monitoring for signs and symptoms of 
potential ILD/pneumonitis (eg, cough, fever, and dyspnoea) and proactively managing events 
with dose modification (reduction or interruption), use of steroid treatment, and (for moderate, 
severe or life-threatening ILD/pneumonitis) discontinuing use of T-DXd.  Appropriate 
monitoring and management is required to mitigate the risk of Grade 4 or Grade 5 
ILD/pneumonitis, which has the potential to impact the benefit-risk for the patient. 
Public health impact: 
There is no potential public health impact beyond the treated population.  
Important Identified Risk: Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
Potential mechanisms: 
The exact mechanism of potential cardiotoxicity manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction 
remains unknown for T-DXd.  HER2 receptors expressed in the membranes of adult 
cardiomyocytes have an important role in transmitting growth and survival signals.  Specifically, 
neuregulin (NRG)-HER2 signalling is involved in cardiac development and physiology, and it is 
suggested that blocking the NRG-1-mediated activation of HER2 reduces fundamental 
intracellular mechanisms that support cardiomyocyte contractility. This is a possible mechanism 
for anti-HER2 agent mediated cardiotoxicity; however, different mechanisms of action of HER2-
Proprietary and Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
targeted therapies contribute to the variable risks of cardiotoxicity across these agents.  Notably, 
the mAb trastuzumab is associated with mostly asymptomatic, reversible cardiac dysfunction, 
whereas the ADC T-DM1 allows intracellular drug delivery that is specific to 
HER2-overexpressing cells and is thereby associated with a lower rate of cardiac dysfunction.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Cardiotoxicity has been observed with anti-HER2 drugs, including single-agent trastuzumab, 
which has a warning for cardiomyopathy.  A nonclinical study in monkeys with T-DXd did not 
show an abnormality in cardiac function tests (including LVEF).   
Ejection fraction decreases have been reported with T-DXd.  However, available clinical data 
show that the reported ejection fraction decreases are of low frequency and severity and are often 
asymptomatic in nature.

LV dysfunction was reported infrequently. Specifically, 11 (0.5%) subjects experienced Grade 1 
events, 48 (2.2%) subjects experienced Grade 2 events, and 10 (0.5%) subjects experienced 
Grade 3 events.  Observed frequency of LVEF decreased on the basis of TEAEs and laboratory 
parameters (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition [MUGA] scanning) was 318 (14.8%), the 
majority (290/2145 [13.5%]) being Grade 2 and 23 of 2145 (1.1%) being Grade 3 (Module 
5.3.4.3 EU RMP Table 5 (U301).  Notably, in Study U302 similar proportions of subjects in the 
T-DXd and T-DM1 arms showed Grade 2 and Grade 3 LVEF measurements (see Module 5.3.4.3 
SCS Table 1.2.6.8 [HER2-low BC]).  In addition, the maximum LVEF decrease and increase 
from baseline were similar in the T-DXd arm.  The LVEF events were generally nonserious,

asymptomatic, and resolved.  Dose reduction or drug discontinuation was only required in few 
subjects. Temporary LVEF decreases <40% was measured in 6 subjects in the ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg 
Pool (details below) (see Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 1.2.6.8 [U301]).   
The most frequent PT used for LV dysfunction was PT of Ejection fraction decreased (63/69).  
Seven additional subjects in the ATT ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool had events of PTs other than Ejection 
fraction decreased, including  
  SAE of Grade 2 cardiac failure congestive that was associated with study drug 
discontinuation and resolved (LVEF value of 63% at baseline and 66% to 70% during 
the study). 
  SAE of Grade 2 cardiac failure that was associated with study drug interruption and 
resolved (LVEF value of 52% at baseline and 39% to 64% during the study). 
  Nonserious Grade 3 cardiac failure (LVEF value of 45%) that was associated with 
study drug discontinuation and resolved (LVEF value of 60% at baseline).  Grade 2 
ejection fraction decreased was also reported and was not resolved at the data cut-off 
date (LVEF value of 55%). 
  Grade 1 cardiac failure on Day 1 after the first dose that was not resolved at the data 
cut-off date (LVEF value of 52% at baseline and 57% to 60% during the study). 
  Grade 2 left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF value of 58% at baseline and 36% at 
Day 85) associated with study drug discontinuation; subject was recovering (LVEF 
value of 47%) 1 month later. 
  Grade 1 left ventricular dysfunction that recovered without dose change. 
  Grade 1 left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF value of 45%) at Cycle 9 that recovered 
within 35 days after drug interruption. 
Spontaneous data from the global safety database up to data lock point (19 Dec 2022): 
The SMQ Cardiac failure (Narrow Scope+PT left ventricular dysfunction) was used to define left 
ventricular dysfunction in the post-marketing setting.  This approach yielded 49 cases 
cumulatively, 33 reporting ejection fraction (EF) decrease (4 of them accompanied by cardiac 
disorder, cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity, and acute myocardial infarction, respectively), 
11 cardiac failure, 1 cardiopulmonary failure, 3 pulmonary edema, and 1 left ventricular 
dysfunction.  Of the 49 cases, 24 cases were serious (mainly cases of cardiac failure, 
cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity, and EF decreased), and 25 cases were nonserious (mainly cases 
of EF decreased).  Cases were often confounded by underlying cardiac/cardiovascular 
comorbidities and/or disease progression.  For 4 cases (2 cardiac failure, 1 cardiopulmonary 
failure with pneumonitis, and 1 EF decrease with pneumonitis), a fatal outcome was reported; 
however, death was primarily associated with progression of the underlying disease. 
The indication for T-DXd was breast cancer in 57.1% of the cases, gastric cancer in 18.4%, and 
lung cancer in 2%, with the remaining cases derived from other cancers (4.1%) and unknown 
indication (18.4%).

Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
When information was provided, EF decrease was reported to be mild, including isolated cases 
with EF decrease to 30%.  Dose reduction in line with the scheme provided in T-DXd label led 
to improvement of EF decrease in most case, where information was available.   
Risk factors and risk groups: 
No risk factors or risk groups have been associated with LVEF decrease.   
Anthracycline therapies are known to cause cardiotoxicity and have been shown to have a 
synergistic effect of cardiotoxicity with trastuzumab, a HER2 receptor antagonist.  In the ATT 
T-DXd ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool, approximately 35% subjects received prior therapy of doxorubicin and 
epirubicin.   
Preventability: 
Standard cardiac function testing (echocardiogram or MUGA scanning) should be performed to 
assess LVEF prior to the initiation of T-DXd and at regular intervals during treatment, as 
clinically indicated (SmPC Section 4.4).  LVEF decrease should be managed through treatment 
interruption or discontinuation (SmPC Section 4.2, 4.4).  Treatment with T-DXd has not been 
studied in patients with LVEF <50% prior to the initiation of treatment (SmPC Section 4.4). 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product: 
If not identified and managed appropriately, left ventricular dysfunction has the potential to lead 
to serious consequences such as cardiac failure with a reduction in the benefit-risk for the patient.   
Potential public health impact: 
There is no potential public health impact beyond the treated population.   
Important Potential Risk: Embryo-Foetal Toxicity 
Potential mechanisms: 
Based on results from general animal toxicity studies, T-DXd and its topoisomerase I inhibitor 
component (DXd) were toxic to rapidly dividing cells (lymphatic/hematopoietic organs, 
intestine, or testes), and DXd was genotoxic, suggesting the potential for embryotoxicity and 
teratogenicity (SmPC Section 5.3). 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Findings from nonclinical data, the potential mechanism of action of the released drug of T-DXd, 
and known effects of anti-HER2 agents on embryo-foetal toxicity suggest that T-DXd may 
potentially cause foetal harm.   
Characterisation of the risk: 
No pregnancy has occurred among women of childbearing potential who were subjects in or 
female partners of male subjects in clinical studies with T-DXd. 
No clinical data on the effect of T-DXd on fertility are available. 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 59 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
No risk factors or risk groups have been associated with embryo-foetal toxicity. 
Preventability: 
Contraception guidelines for both women of childbearing potential and men with female partners 
of childbearing potential are provided in SmPC Section 4.4 and SmPC Section 4.6.  The 
pregnancy status of females of childbearing potential should be verified prior to the initiation of 
T-DXd.  Females of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of 
childbearing potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product: 
It is possible that exposure to T-DXd during pregnancy may cause foetal harm.   
Potential public health impact: 
There is no potential public health impact beyond the treated population.   
Important Potential Risk: Product confusion-related medication errors 
Potential mechanisms: 
With the availability of other trastuzumab-containing products and the HER2-targeted ADC 
trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) prescribers could potentially mix up trastuzumab containing 
product if they would not use the tradename. Pharmacists reconstituting the infusion could 
potentially mix up trastuzumab-containing products if there are no specific distinguishing 
features regarding livery and cap colour of the vial to differentiate between trastuzumab-
containing products.   
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
For trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) 4 cases due to a confusion between trastuzumab emtansine 
and trastuzumab were reported in clinical trials and 2 spontaneous cases are evident for Kadcyla 
in the Eudravigilance database (data lock point 19 Dec 2022) reporting PT ‘Wrong drug 
administered’ or ‘Product name confusion’. Both cases involve two trastuzumab-containing 
products and both cases were not associated with an adverse event.   
As of 19 Dec 2022, there have been no case reports of product confusion-related medication 
errors associated with T-DXd. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
There is a potential for serious clinical consequences (eg, lack of efficacy) by inadvertently 
substituting one trastuzumab-containing product for another considering different dosing 
schedules apply for each product. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Not determinable. 
Preventability: 
To minimise the potential risk of product confusion-related medication errors with other 
trastuzumab-containing products, the vials and packages of T-DXd have distinctly different 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 60 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
designs. Additionally, the SmPC (SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 6.6) contains clear instructions for 
the health care professional regarding correct administration of T-DXd and differentiation from 
other trastuzumab-containing products, which is expected to further reduce the risk of 
medication errors with -DXd. 
Furthermore, T-DXd will only be prescribed by a physician and administered under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional who is experienced in the treatment of cancer patients 
which will further reduce the risk of such medication error. The use of the trade name 
(ENHERTU), rather than the International Nonproprietary Name (trastuzumab deruxtecan) can 
also minimise this risk of product confusion-related medication errors.  
Potential public health impact: 
There is no potential public health impact beyond the treated population.   
Missing Information:  Use in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment  
Evidence source:  
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from the clinical trial development 
programme.  The safety profile of T-DXd may be different in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment as the drug is primarily hepatically metabolised.  
Population in need of further characterisation:  
Patients with metastatic BC, GC, or NSCLC who have severe hepatic impairment. The safety 
profile in patients with severe hepatic impairment can further be characterised if such patients are 
exposed to T-DXd during postmarketing experience. 
Missing Information: Long-term Safety 
Evidence source:  
T-DXd is intended for long-term treatment and to date, long-term safety is considered missing 
information 
Population in need of further characterisation:  
Patients with metastatic BC, GC, or NSCLC. Long-term safety will be further characterised 
through Phase 3 clinical studies.

Additional Risk Minimisation Measures 
For the important identified risk of ILD/pneumonitis, an HCP Guide and a Patient Card are 
additional risk minimisation measures.  
For the important potential risk of product confusion-related medication errors, an HCP Guide is 
an additional risk minimisation measure.  
The proposed draft key messages of the additional risk minimisation activities are provided in 
Annex 6. 
Additional risk minimisation 1: Healthcare Professional Guide (ILD/Pneumonitis) 
Objectives: 
The objective of the HCP Guide is to ensure early recognition and diagnosis of ILD/pneumonitis, 
to allow prompt and appropriate treatment and minimise serious outcomes.   
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
The HCP Guide improves HCP awareness of the risk of ILD/pneumonitis and management 
options, which may lead to early detection of and intervention for ILD/pneumonitis cases in 
clinical practice and thus potentially minimises the occurrence of more serious ILD/pneumonitis 
cases.  The guide also improves the adherence to the key risk minimisation measures for 
ILD/pneumonitis defined in the T-DXd SmPC. 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 67 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
Where T-DXd is supplied, all HCPs are provided with the HCP Guide to use as a reminder/quick 
reference material before the administration of T-DXd. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
The Applicant verifies distribution of the HCP Guide and tests the understanding and knowledge 
of the key messages by the HCPs and evaluates the effectiveness using a survey.  
The frequency of all ILD/pneumonitis including ILD/pneumonitis cases with a fatal outcome in 
the postmarketing setting will be evaluated periodically and are presented in each Periodic Safety 
Update Report. 
Additional risk minimisation 2: Patient Card 
Objectives: 
The objective of the PC is to remind the patient of the risk of ILD/pneumonitis as well as its 
signs and symptoms and to encourage the patients to consult with the treating physician if they 
develop any relevant clinical signs/symptoms.  The wallet-size Patient Card is intended as a 
convenient way to keep patients aware of the ILD/pneumonitis risk.  
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
Being reminded about the signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis increases the likelihood that 
patients will seek attention from an HCP for early detection and treatment of ILD/pneumonitis.  
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
The HCP provides the PC to the patient before initial administration of T-DXd.  The PC has a 
compact design for portability. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
The MAH verifies distribution of the PC in the prescriber survey.  
The frequency of all ILD/pneumonitis including ILD/pneumonitis cases with a fatal outcome in 
the postmarketing setting are evaluated periodically and are presented in each Periodic Safety 
Update Report. 
Additional risk minimisation 3: Healthcare Professional Guide for prevention of product 
confusion-related medication errors 
Objectives:  
The objective of the HCP Guide is to ensure that the medicinal product being prescribed, 
prepared and administered is T-DXd and not other trastuzumab-containing products or the 
HER2-targeted ADC trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla).  
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
The HCP Guide improves HCP awareness of the potential risk for product confusion-related 
medication errors due to the availability of multiple trastuzumab-containing products and 
trastuzumab emtansine. The HCP Guide ensures the adherence to labelled language during the 
prescription, preparation and administration processes with T-DXd.

All cases representing potential product confusion-related medication errors in the postmarketing 
setting are evaluated periodically in terms of frequency, involved drugs, root causes (if available) 
as well as clinical outcomes and are presented in each Periodic Safety Update Report.

PART VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ENHERTU  
This is a summary of the RMP for T-DXd.  The RMP details important risks of T-DXd, how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about T-DXd’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
The SmPC and package leaflet for T-DXd give essential information to HCPs and patients on 
how T-DXd should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for T-DXd should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which will 
be part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of T-DXd’s 
RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is indicated: 
  As monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
HER2-positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based 
regimens.   
  As monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2-positive 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based 
regimen. 
  As monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
HER2-low breast cancer who have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic 
setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing 
adjuvant chemotherapy. 
  As monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC whose 
tumours have an activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutation and who require systemic 
therapy following platinum based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. 
Further information about the evaluation of T-DXd’s benefits be found in T-DXd’s EPAR 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/enhertu), including in its 
plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES 
TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of T-DXd, together with measures to minimise such risks, are outlined below. 
  Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be the 
following: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(eg, with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of T-DXd, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is continuously collected and 
regularly analysed, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of is not yet available for T-DXd, it is listed 
under “missing information” below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of T-DXd are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of T-DXd.  Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risks with T-DXd include ILD/pneumonitis and left ventricular dysfunction 
as outlined below.  
Important Identified Risk 1:  Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Dose-dependent changes in the lung were seen in nonclinical data 
(Section Part II: Module SII).  ILD/pneumonitis was reported in 
clinical studies with T-DXd, including fatal outcomes.  An 
independent Adjudication Committee adjudicated all potential 
events of ILD. 
Seven baseline factors of interest were identified: age <65 vs ≥65 
years; patients treated in Japan vs non-Japan; dose of >6.4 vs 
≤6.4 mg/kg; baseline oxygen saturation <95% vs ≥95%; 
moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline vs no impairment; 
presence of lung comorbidities (yes vs no; asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, prior ILD/pneumonitis, pulmonary 
fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, or radiation pneumonitis); and 
time since initial diagnosis of >4 vs ≤4 years.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
ANNEX 6  DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK 
MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES  
Prior to the launch of trastuzumab deruxtecan in each member state, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree on the content and format of the educational programme (Healthcare 
Professional [HCP] Guide,  Patient Card for ILD/pneumonitis and HCP Guide for product 
confusion-related medication errors), including communication media, distribution modalities, 
and other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority. 
The educational programme is aimed at: 
I) 
II) 
ensuring early recognition of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, to allow prompt 
appropriate treatment and to mitigate worsening of the condition 
improving HCP awareness of the potential risk for product confusion-related medication 
errors due to the availability of multiple trastuzumab-containing products and 
trastuzumab emtansine 
The MAH will ensure that each member state where trastuzumab deruxtecan is marketed, all 
HCPs and patients who are expected to administer/be administered trastuzumab deruxtecan are 
provided with the educational material. 
I) Healthcare Professional (HCP) Guide for ILD/pneumonitis 
The HCP Guide will contain the following key elements:   
  Summary of important findings of trastuzumab deruxtecan-induced ILD/pneumonitis 
(eg, frequency, grade, time to onset) observed in the clinical trial setting 
  Description of the appropriate monitoring and evaluation of ILD/pneumonitis in 
patients receiving trastuzumab deruxtecan  
  Detailed description of management of ILD/pneumonitis in patients treated with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan including guidance on drug interruption, reduction and 
treatment discontinuation for ILD/pneumonitis 
  Reminder to HCP that they should repeat the information about signs and symptoms 
of ILD/pneumonitis at each patient visit, including when the patient should seek 
attention from an HCP (eg, the symptoms to watch for; the importance to adhere to 
scheduled appointments) 
  Reminder to HCP to provide the patient with the Patient Card (PC), including advice 
that the PC should be kept with the patient at all times 
Patient Card 
The Patient Card will contain the following key elements: 
  Description of the important risks of ILD/pneumonitis associated with the use of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan 
  Description of key signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis and guidance on when to 
seek attention from an HCP 
  Contact details of the trastuzumab deruxtecan prescriber

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan 
  Cross-reference to Patient Information Leaflet 
II) Healthcare Professional Guide for prevention of medication errors 
The HCP Guide will contain the following key elements:   
  Alert to HCPs about a potential risk of confusion between Enhertu (trastuzumab 
deruxtecan) and other trastuzumab-containing products and the HER2-targeted 
antibody-drug conjugate Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine)  
  Mitigation measures for prescribing errors due to similarities in active ingredient 
names and measures to avoid errors during prescription phase by physicians 
  Comparison of commercial appearance between Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) 
and other trastuzumab-containing products and the HER2-targeted antibody-drug 
conjugate Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) 
  Potential mitigation strategies to avoid errors during preparation phase by pharmacists 
  Detailed Information about the dosage, method of administration and preparation as 
well as instructions to avoid medication errors during administration phase by nurses

Annex II 
Although available evidence is not sufficient to establish a 
to add DRESS as an important potential risk as well 
as the removal of the additional risk minimization 
measures for serious infections, following the 
assessment of procedure PSUSA/00000209/202205. 
Annex II is updated in accordance. 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
causal association between DRESS and anakinra, DRESS 
has been reported in patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors, 
predominantly in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (sJIA). Patients with DRESS may require 
hospitalization, as this condition may be fatal. If signs and 
symptoms of DRESS is present and an alternative aetiology 
cannot be established, anakinra should be discontinued and 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

is included as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
The additional risk minimization measures (educational 
materials for HCPs and reminder card for patients) for the 
safety concern of serious infections are removed from the 
RMP as this safety concern is found to be already 
sufficiently described in the product information.

EMEA/H/C/000363/II/086. This is a prospective, 
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the early start 
of anakinra treatment guided by suPAR in patients 
with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2 in improving the clinical 
state of COVID-19 patients over 28 days as 
measured by the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-
CPS. Following review of the final CSR, the section 
5.1 of the SmPC is updated to revise the percentage 
of patients receiving dexamethasone during 
treatment. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
make some editorial changes in the product

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC to update the 
clinical efficacy and safety information in Still’s 
disease. 
The updates proposed are based on the results from 
study Sobi.ANAKIN-301 (evaluated in procedure no. 
EMA/H/C/000363/P46/031) and Sobi.ANAKIN-302 
(evaluated in procedure no. 
EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0073).  
Sobi.ANAKIN-301 was a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and 
immunogenicity of anakinra as compared to placebo 
in newly diagnosed Still’s disease patients (including 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [SJIA] and 
adult-onset Still’s disease [AOSD]). 
Sobi.ANAKIN-302 was a non-interventional, post-
authorisation safety study to evaluate long-term 
safety of anakinra in patients with SJIA. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to correct 
in SmPC section 4.8 the MedDRA System Organ 
Class (SOC) for the adverse reaction ‘Injection Site 
Reaction’ and changed the SOC from ‘Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorder’ to ‘General disorders 
and administration site conditions’; and to align the 
product information with QRD template 10.2 rev.1. 
Further, minor editorial corrections were introduced 
in the SmPC. Those changes are accepted by CHMP.

to be overrepresented. A causal relationship with Kineret 
has not been established. 
Pulmonary events (Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary 
hypertension, alveolar proteinosis) are added as an

Safety analyses for allergic reactions concomitant with the 
warning on allergic reactions to specify that 
anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been 
reported as allergic reactions associated with 
administration of anakinra. Section 4.8 is updated to 
add the events of rash and allergic reactions 
including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, 
urticaria and pruritus. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to make a correction in the user 
intructions section of the of the package leaflet and 
to amend the product information to bring it in line 
with the QRD template (v.7.3.1). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
use of anakinra were performed covering from 14 
November 2001 to 25 February 2008 and from 26 February 
2008 to 13 May 2010. The analyses included all 
spontaneous, literature, registry, health-authority reports, 
and reports from clinical trials that were received by the 
MAH. The first analysis presents a total of 252 events (41 
from clinical trial, 18 from registries studies and 193 from 
spontaneous reporting) of allergic reactions associated with 
anakinra exposure from 186 cases (37 from clinical trials 
[21 serious], 13 from registries studies [11 serious] and 
136 [37 serious] from spontaneous reporting). The second 
analysis presents 31 events of allergic reactions associated 
with anakinra exposure from 20 medically confirmed case 
reports. Ten of these reports contained in total 15 serious 
adverse events. No case reports had a fatal outcome. 
Based on the data presented from the post-marketing 
registry study and spontaneous reports the following 
events are considered possible adverse drug reactions 
following anakinra administration: rash, urticaria, pruritus, 
Page 22/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
angioedema and anaphylactic reaction. From the clinical 
trials data, there is supportive evidence of association with 
hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, rash and 
pruritus. Therefore the existing warning on allergic 
reactions in Section 4.4 is amended to specify that these 
reactions can include anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema. In section 4.8 allergic reactions (including 
anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, urticaria and pruritus) 
are reported with a frequency of uncommon (?/1,000 to 
<1/100). Rash is reported with the same frequency.

Kineret in paediatric subjects with polyarticular-course 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, it emerged that the forming 
of neutralising antibodies was more common in children 
(6%) than in adults (3%). Therefore, the CHMP concluded 
that section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the SPC should be 
updated to include the incidence of neutralising antibodies 
observed in clinical studies in paediatric patients.

favourable. Therefore, the renewal of its marketing 
authorisation was granted with unlimited validity.

During the assessment of PSUR n. 6 (covering the period 
including the incidence of anti-anakinra antibodies in 
II, Labelling 
from 14 May 2004 to 13 November 2004), the MAH was 
clinical studies and that the incidence of these 
and PL 
requested to highlight and justify any differences between 
antibodies has no implications on safety and efficacy 
of the product following the CHMP assessment of 
PSUR No. 6. 
To include in sections 4.4 and 6.5 of the SPC a 
warning that the vial stopper and/or the needle cover 
of the prefilled syringe contains a derivative of latex 
that may cause allergic reactions. Section 2 of the PL 
has been updated accordingly. 
To update section 6 "Further information" of the PL 
in order to clarify information on how to inject the 
product following feedback from patients. 
To update the Annexes in line with the EMEA QRD 
template version 7.0. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
the European SPC and the Core Data Sheet (CDS). One 
substantive divergence was pointed out that concerned the 
occurrence of antibodies which are "common" in clinical 
trials and for which a statement was given in section 4.8 of 
the CDS but was not to be introduced into the SPC. The 
MAH informed that whilst antibodies to Kineret had been 
detected in clinical study subjects, the presence of 
antibodies had not been associated either with the 
occurrence of adverse effects or with reduced efficacy. The 
MAH explained that pharmacovigilance surveillance had not 
detected either any unexpected reductions in efficacy over 
long-term treatment, or any anaphylactoid or other adverse 
reactions for which a causal link to the development of 
antibodies had been suspected.  
The CHMP concluded that, even tough not an intentional 
finding, the formation of antibodies has been observed as 
"common" in clinical trials (across the studies whereby anti-
anakinra antibodies were assessed, neutralising antibodies 
Page 26/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were observed in approximately 2% of all subjects 
receiving anakinra for up to 3 years of duration), and 
therefore, in accordance with the SPC guideline, all adverse 
reactions should be included in the SPC if they are at least 
possibly causally related, based for example on their 
comparative incidence in clinical trials, or on findings from 
epidemiological studies and/or on an evaluation of causality 
from individual reports.  
Thus the CHMP concluded that the physician should be 
made aware of the findings and that sections 4.8 
"Undesirable effects" and  5.1 "Pharmacodynamic 
properties" of the SPC should be updated to include the 
incidence of anti-anakinra antibodies in clinical studies and 
that the incidence of these antibodies has no implications 
on safety and efficacy of the product.

patients with asthma, the incidence of serious infection was 
higher in Kineret-treated patients (4.5%) vs. 
placebo-treated patients (0%).    
In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, no difference was 
detected in anti-tetanus antibody response between Kineret 
and placebo treatment groups when a tetanus/diphtheria 
toxoid vaccine was administered concurrently with Kineret.  
No data are available on the effects of vaccination with 
other inactivated antigens in patients receiving Kineret. No

This variation relates to an update of section 4.8 of 
the SPC on serious infections and malignancies as 
requested by the CHMP following the assessment of 
PSUR No. 5 for Kineret. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or 
on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines 
in patients receiving Kineret. Therefore, live vaccines 
should not be given concurrently with Kineret. This new 
information is added in the SPC. 
The MAH proposed to include in the SPC that  the 
concurrent use of Kineret  with etanercept or any other TNF 
antagonist is not recommended. 
Following the assessment of PSUR No. 5 for Kineret, 
covering the period from 14 November 2003 to 13 May 
2004, the CHMP requested the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) to update section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of 
the SPC on serious infections and on malignancies. In 
observations up to 3 years, the serious infection rate 
remained stable over time and in clinical studies and post-
marketing experience, rare cases of opportunistic infections 
have been observed and included fungal, mycobacterial, 
bacterial, and viral pathogens. Infections have been noted 
in all organ systems and have been reported in patients 
receiving Kineret alone or in combination with 
immunosuppressive agents.  
Also rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients may be at a higher 
risk (on average 2-3 fold) for the development of 
lymphoma. In clinical trials, whilst patients treated with 
Kineret had a higher incidence of lymphoma than the 
expected rate in the general population, this rate is 
consistent with rates reported in general for RA patients.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Gilead Sciences Ireland UC submitted on 24 July 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Jyseleca, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 June 2018. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Jyseleca is indicated as monotherapy or in combination 
with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis 
who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant to, one or more DMARDs.  
Jyseleca is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely 
active rheumatoid arthritis who have highly active and early progressive (erosive) disease, were not 
previously treated with MTX, and for whom treatment with MTX is inappropriate.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0371/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance filgotinib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication initially proposed by the applicant was as follows: 
“Jyseleca is indicated as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional 
synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are 
intolerant to, one or more DMARDs.  
Jyseleca is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely 
active rheumatoid arthritis who have highly active and early progressive (erosive) disease, were not 
previously treated with MTX, and for whom treatment with MTX is inappropriate.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, incurable, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects 
about 1% of the adult population worldwide, with onset typically between the ages of 30 and 50 years, 
and a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence in women. The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of 
the joints, occurring in the synovial tissue and manifesting in swelling, pain, stiffness, and restricted 
mobility. This inflammation may be associated with the destruction of articular cartilage and 
juxta-articular bone, causing irreversible joint damage (Firestein 2003, Smolen 2007, Smolen 2016a). 
Rheumatoid arthritis is also associated with extra-articular manifestations that may involve the skin, 
eyes, salivary glands, and lungs. Lung involvement may include interstitial lung disease, which is 
responsible for significant morbidity and mortality (Olson 2011, Raimundo 2019). Cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) is markedly increased in patients with RA, in part due to accelerated atherosclerosis from chronic 
inflammation. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, 
diabetes mellitus, and physical inactivity are also highly prevalent among patients with RA and contribute 
to the increased CVD risk (Crowson 2018, Gonzalez 2008, Solomon 2010). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology of RA is unknown, although genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors (such as smoking) 
have been identified as contributors, and the development of inflammation is associated with loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens (Aletaha 2018, Smolen 2016b). The disease pathophysiology is heterogeneous, 
with joint inflammation and destruction driven by interactions between multiple resident cells and 
infiltrating immune cells, leading to propagation and maintenance of a pro-inflammatory cytokine 
response, a key driver of the disease. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints manifesting in swelling, pain, stiffness, 
and restricted mobility. This inflammation may be associated with irreversible joint damage and there are 
also extra-articular manifestations (see further above). 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 12/170 
 
 
 
The RA diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination, guided by additional procedures 
such as laboratory testing. Erosions detected by X-ray and positivity for antibodies against cyclic 
citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) or Rheumatoid Factor (RF) are factors associated with poor prognosis. 
2.1.5.  Management 
According to EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) recommendations (EULAR 
recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis with synthetic and biological 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: 2016 update), treatment should be initiated as soon as the RA 
diagnosis is made. Treatment should be aimed at reaching a target of sustained low disease activity. 
Methotrexate (MTX) should be the first treatment strategy. In patients with contraindications to MTX (or 
early intolerance), leflunomide or sulfalazine should be considered as the (first) line treatment strategy. 
If there is no improvement by at most 3 months after start of treatment or the target has not been 
reached by 6 months, therapy should be adjusted. Depending on whether poor prognostic factors are 
present or not, other csDMARD or addition of a bDMARD (biologic DMARD) or tsDMARD (targeted 
synthetic DMARD) could then be considered. JAK-inhibitors are tsDMARD.  
Despite the recent advances in this therapeutic field, there all still patients who either cannot tolerate or 
do not respond to the available treatment options i.e. there is still an unmet need. 
About the product 
Filgotinib is a new JAK-inhibitor initially intended for 1st, 2nd and 3rd line treatment of RA either as 
monotherapy or as combination therapy (see above for claimed indication). The proposed posology was 
200 mg once daily (100 mg once daily for patients with severe renal impairment). 
Type of Application and aspects on development

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of filgotinib maleate is N-(5-{4-[(1,1-Dioxidothiomorpholin-4-yl) 
methyl]phenyl}[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide (2Z)-but-2-enedioate 
corresponding to the molecular formula C21H23N5O3S.C4H4O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 541.6 
g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of filgotinib maleate was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy and single crystal x-ray 
crystallography. The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) and x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). 
Filgotinib maleate is a white to off-white achiral, slightly hygroscopic crystalline salt with three ionizable 
nitrogens exhibiting pH-dependent solubility in aqueous media. It is slightly soluble at pH 2 but practically 
insoluble at pH 5-7. A single polymorphic form was identified during development although water may 
also be present in the crystal lattice. Particle size is controlled in the active substance specification to 
ensure the performance of the finished product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Filgotinib maleate is synthesized convergently in several main steps using well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. The starting materials were discussed with CHMP during a scientific advice 
procedure and the applicant followed the advice. 
The Applicant has presented a comprehensive understanding of the origin, fate and purge of impurities 
generated during each step supported by spiking experiments at appropriate levels. In-process controls 
(IPCs) are in place to monitor key impurities. The final crystallisation and isolation step has been designed 
to control the polymorphic form and particle size distribution of filgotinib maleate. 
An  enhanced  development  approach  was  used  for  the  design  of  the  active  substance  manufacturing 
process using elements of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm. For each step, a D-Optimal DoE (Design 
of Experiments) study was performed at lab scale. The selection of the factors included in each DoE study 
and  their  ranges  was  guided  by  risk  assessment  (FMEA)  informed  by  reaction  understanding,  prior 
knowledge, and univariate experiments. The responses for each DoE were appropriate and included the 
levels  of  the  main  impurities  requiring  control.  Acceptance  criteria  for  the  selected  responses  are  the 
same as those listed in the intermediate and active substance specifications. 
For each DoE, statistical models were generated for the laboratory scale experiments and assessed using 
a defined process described for each response.

EMA/424374/2020

A design space is claimed for all the steps of the manufacturing process. Each design space is clearly 
described with parameter ranges defined in tabular format within the process description. The 
experiments to define the design spaces were conducted on lab scale although indications from further 
process development work are that there is no scale and equipment size dependency. However, a design 
space verification protocol has been submitted to cover commercial scale processing and is deemed 
acceptable.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of the 
active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
The manufacturing route to filgotinib has been essentially the same throughout development. The 
applicant has demonstrated that the process parameters in place are sufficient to ensure the correct 
polymorphic form is generated. The active substance impurity profile has been similar throughout 
development. 
The active substance is packaged in sealed double polyethylene bags stored in heat sealed, 
polyethylene-lined aluminium foil pouches. The foil bags are held in high-density polyethylene drums. The 
primary packaging material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), insoluble 
particulates (visual inspection), water content (Ph. Eur.), maleic acid content (HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), volatile organic impurities (GC) and particle size (laser 
diffraction). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. A risk assessment was 
conducted for the presence of potentially mutagenic impurities in the active substance and those 
identified were then assessed by QSAR analysis. If a risk wasn’t ruled out, then Ames testing was 
conducted. 2 compounds were identified which are classed at class 2 and 3 according to ICH M7 
respectively. Spike and purge studies were conducted to evaluate amounts present in the active 
substance relative to the TTC for each impurity. It was demonstrated that controlling these impurities 
according to ICH M7 option 3 (as unspecified impurities in either a starting material or intermediate) 
ensures that they are purged well below the respective TTCs. 
Adequate justification was provided for omitting some tests from the specification. Process parameters 
have been shown to control polymorphic form so no test is required. The active substance has a low water 
activity so a test for microbial examination is not necessary. Risk assessments have concluded that no 
control of elemental or inorganic impurities are needed.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from pilot and production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 4 pilot and production scale batches of active substance covering both of the proposed 
manufacturers stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up 
to 18 months under long term conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated

conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: appearance; assay; impurities; water content. The analytical methods used were the same 
as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes to appearance, assay or impurity content were observed. There was a small initial 
increase in water content which stabilised after 3 months without further trends. In addition, supportive 
data was provided to demonstrate that particle size, polymorphic form and maleic acid content do not 
change over time. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Filgotinib maleate is not 
photosensitive. Samples were also stored at either -20 or 60ºC for up to 4 weeks. Other than an initial 
increase in water content, no other changes were observed. Filgotinib was found to be degraded by 
hydrogen peroxide, light, acid and base when in aqueous solution. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored below 30 ºC 
in the proposed container.

The aim of development was an immediate release solid oral dosage form. In phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical 
studies, different formulations were used for practical reasons. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated 
that the profiles of the various formulations are equivalent in vivo. 
Filgotinib maleate is a crystalline solid with a single known polymorph which is stable during formulation. 
It exhibits pH-dependent solubility. It is classed as Biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS II), i.e. 
low solubility but high permeability. In order to prevent degradation, a desiccant is included in the 
primary packaging.

The chosen excipients are controlled according to Ph. Eur. standards, except for the film-coating for which 
there is an in-house standard. However, the coating components are of Ph. Eur. standard. No novel 
excipients are used and no incompatibilities were identified between filgotinib maleate and the excipients. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Initially, there was very little information on the development of the dissolution method, although the 
applicant had sought scientific advice on the topic on several occasions. The CHMP advice had not been 
clearly addressed in the description of how the dissolution method was developed and the discriminatory 
ability of the dissolution method had not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Questions were raised, both as 
major objections and other concerns. In response, the applicant further explained the development of the 
method and the investigation of its discriminatory power. Comparative dissolution profiles were provided 
for both tablet strengths. The QC dissolution method uses the paddle apparatus. The justification was 
deemed acceptable and the method is suitable as a QC procedure. 
Taking into account the properties of the active substance, a granulation approach was adopted, followed 
by compression to form tablets and then film-coating. Some elements of a QbD approach were applied. 
Risk assessments were carried out, informed by prior knowledge to identify potential critical process 
parameters (CPPs) for each step that could have an impact on finished product critical quality attributes 
(CQAs). These parameters were then investigated using both univariate and multivariate 
experimentation and optimised accordingly. For the roller compaction step, a full factorial DoE was carried 
out. The properties of the resultant powder blends were then measure, as well as the properties of the 
tablet cores following compaction and the film-coated tablets. All materials met with their acceptance 
criteria, irrespective of the DoE input parameters. Nonetheless are considered CPPs for the commercial 
granulation process. The applicant has declared that no design space is claimed and that parameters will 
be at their set-points. Only 1 parameter at a time may be moved from its set-point within the proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs). 
Tablets are packaged in HDPE bottles, fitted with screw caps and sealed with an aluminium liner prior to 
first opening. Each bottle also contains a sachet of desiccant (silica gel) to control moisture exposure and 
a polyester coil. Regarding the material in bottles and screw caps, compliance with relevant EU 
regulations and Ph. Eur. quality requirements are declared. 
The primary packaging is an HDPE bottle, fitted with a screw cap and sealed with an aluminium liner prior 
to first opening. Each bottle also contains a sachet of desiccant (silica gel) to control moisture exposure 
and a polyester coil. The material primary materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of several main steps. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
There are several process intermediates. Data has been provided to justify the bulk holding times for each 
intermediate. 
Manufacture of multiple batches up to double the planned commercial scale during development batches 
has  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. Formal process validation will be carried out on 3 production 
scale batches of each strength of tablet prior to commercialization. The process validation plan is deemed 
adequate. The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance, identity (HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed array of tests is deemed to be acceptable. The degradation product limit is justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. No risk was identified. In 
addition, batch analysis data on several pilot to production scale batches using a validated ICP-MS 
method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% 
of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it is not necessary to 
include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
The applicant submitted a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamines in Jyseleca. Both 
active substance and finished product manufacturing processes were considered, along with raw 
materials and packaging. No significant risk was identified. The analysis was deemed acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for several pilot to production scale batches of each strength 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 4 pilot to production scale batches of each strength tablet stored for up to 18 months 
under long term conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC 
/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Jyseleca were identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were 
tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  water  content,  dissolution  and  microbiological 
examination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed, other than a small decrease in 
water attributed to the presence of the silica desiccant. 
An in-use study was performed on 1 batch of each strength for 30 days. At the end of the period, water 
content had increased otherwise the results are in line with those of the other stability studies. 
Considering the specification limit set for water, the commercial pack size is 30 tablets/bottle and the 
intended dosage regimen is one tablet once daily, the results do not cause concern. 
In addition, 1 batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is not photosensitive. Samples of 
both strengths were also stored at 60°C for 2 weeks and -20°C for one month without negative impact on 
the evaluated parameters. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  24  months  with  the  following  storage 
statement as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable: “This medicinal product does not require any 
special temperature storage conditions. Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture. 
Keep the bottle tightly closed.”

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has applied QbD 
principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and their manufacturing 
processes. Design spaces have been proposed for all steps of the active substance manufacturing process 
but not for the finished product. An adequate design space verification protocol has been provided. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro – biochemical assays 
Filgotinib has been tested in different biochemical kinase assays against the JAK family members (JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)). The in vitro enzymatic activity of human JAKs were measured 
by 33P-incorporation analysis, TriFRET and ULight assays. In these assays, filgotinib repetitively inhibited 
JAK1 and JAK2 with similar potency; half max inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10-53 nM and 28-29 nM, 
respectively. For JAK3 and TYK2 family kinases 6- to 80-fold (311-810 nM) and 3- to 11-fold (116-177 
nM) higher IC50 values, respectively, were observed. Even though, filgotinib exerts lower inhibitory 
activity against JAK3 and TYK2, the IC50 values are well within clinically relevant concentrations 
(Cmax~6 µM).  
Also, the main metabolite GS-829845 was assessed regarding its capacity to inhibit the different human 
JAKs. The metabolite shows 10-fold lower potency against JAK1 and JAK2 than filgotinib itself (IC50 
around 500-600 nM). The exposure of the GS-829845 metabolite at steady state, Cmax 9.8 µM, suggests 
that this major metabolite may contribute to JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitory effects in vivo. The metabolite 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 19/170 
 
 
 
displayed > 5-fold selectivity for JAK1/JAK2 over JAK3/TYK. The IC50 values for JAK3 and TYK2 were 
>3606 and >2996 nM, respectively, indicating that this main filgotinib metabolite GC-829845 may also 
contribute to JAK3 and TYK2 inhibition in vivo at higher doses.   
Notably, all the biochemical assays were conducted in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
concentrations ≤10 µM. In Clark et al, filgotinib were tested in biochemical assays in the presence of 1000 
µM ATP. As expected, higher IC50 values for all JAKs were seen. Filgotinib show IC50 values for JAK1 (363 
nM), JAK2 (2400 nM), and JAK3(2600 nM) within concentrations of clinical relevance, whereas for TYK2 
an IC50 > 10.000 nM were reported. The results confirm that several JAKs can potentially be targeted at 
clinical exposure levels. 
In vitro cellular assays 
Effects and cellular potency of filgotinib on JAK inhibition was studied in several different cell systems. The 
cell-lines used were all of human origin and treated with different stimuli known to phosphorylate 
particular STATs via different JAKs. For the JAK1 and JAK3 mediated phosphorylation of signal 
transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6), STAT5 and STAT1 following interleukin-4 (IL-4), 
IL-2 and interferon γ (IFNγ) stimulations, IC50 values of 179 – 3364 nM were observed. None of these 
JAK dependent cell assays were specific for JAK3 and hence the relative contribution of JAK3 vs JAK1 in 
the JAK1/JAK3 dependent assay could not be discerned. The inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation was 
studied in IL-3 and erythropoietin (EPO) induced TF1 cells and UT-7-EPO cells, both specific for JAK2 
inhibition. The stimulation with IL-3 shows an IC50 of 3524 nM, whereas JAK2 mediated phosphorylation 
of STAT5 showed IC50 of >10.000 nM in the EPO induced cells. 
It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on potency and selectivity on specific JAKs from all cell assays 
conducted, but it can be concluded that filgotinib shows similar activity on JAK1 and JAK2 with IC50 
values in the range of the concentrations found at steady state in RA patients, and potentially both these 
pathways are inhibited in vivo. The exception includes EPO stimulation of UT-7 cells where IC50 of > 
10.000 nM were observed. However, the clinical relevance of this finding does not corroborate with 
toxicity findings in animal models. In rats and dogs, anaemia (an effect associated with EPO induced JAK 
2 inhibition) was observed at 100 mg/kg (~10-fold exposure margin) and 5 mg/kg (~2-fold exposure 
margin), respectively. However, anaemia was not observed in the clinic. 
In Oncostatin M (OSM) stimulated HeLA cells, filgotinib and the metabolite GS-829845 were studied 
against STAT1 phosphorylation (JAK1/JAK2 dependent) in a luciferase assay. The results show that the 
metabolite is around 10 times less potent than filgotinib itself, which is in agreement with biochemical 
studies. 
In vitro blood cells (ex-vivo) studies 
In the whole blood assays, blood was drawn from healthy subjects and pre-incubated in vitro with 
filgotinib and treated with different cytokines. The JAK-activities were quantified by measuring 
phosphorylation of STATs by flow cytometry or Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the 
signalling where JAK1 are involved, the STAT-phosphorylation was inhibited with IC50 values varying 
between 629-1789 nM; whereas the JAK2 dependent GM–CSF stimulated STAT5 phosphorylation was 
inhibited at higher concentrations (IC50 17453 nM). Filgotinib inhibited IL-6 induced STAT1 
phosphorylation (JAK1/JAK3/TYK2 dependent signal) with IC50 values ranging from 629 nM to 1180 nM. 
Filgotinib also inhibited IL-2 induced STAT5 (JAK1/JAK3), IFNα STAT1 (JAK1/TYK2) and IL-6 STAT3 
(JAK1/JAK3/TYK2) signalling with IC50 values between 1127-3410 nM. Since no JAK3 selective assay is 
available, it could not be sorted out from the JAK1/JAK3 dependent assays whether filgotinib is active on 
JAK1 only or both JAK1 and JAK3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 20/170 
 
 
 
In study 185, filgotinib was studied in order to further assess the JAK1 over JAK2 selectivity. In the JAK2 
inhibition of STAT5 by filgotinib in GM-CSF stimulated human blood cells, a 28-fold greater inhibition of 
JAK1 than JAK2 was found. The selectivity towards JAK1 over JAK2 with the experimental settings 
employed in above study is noted. In contrast, the in vitro selectivity assays have demonstrated that 
filgotinib shows similar activity towards JAK1 and JAK2 and furthermore somehow lower activity to JAK3 
and TYK2 (but still at concentrations of clinical relevance). Moreover, inhibition of these JAKs could 
potentially be of clinical concern since both JAK2 and JAK3 associated effects have been observed in the 
animal toxicity studies. However, this was not clearly observed in RA-patients.  
In study 186, the main metabolite GS-829845 was studied in whole blood, using same stimuli as in the 
filgotinib study 185. For the metabolite GS-829845, around 10-20-fold lower IC50 values were found for 
the different JAK1 specific pathways as compared to filgotinib itself. This is in agreement with the 
biochemical assays. Considering that the exposure of this metabolite is 16-21-fold higher than filgotinib 
after 200 mg twice a day (bid), the metabolite may exert PD effects that is of clinical relevance. 
Species comparison 
In addition to JAK inhibitory effects in humans, filgotinib blocked IL6 induced STAT1 and STAT3 
phosphorylation in whole blood from rat and mouse indicating species cross-reactivity. The rat IC50 
values are in same range as human IC50, whereas for mouse 3-fold higher IC50 values for filgotinib were 
observed. For the other species used in the toxicity studies (dogs and rabbits), no data regarding 
JAK-inhibition was presented. The applicant´s justification for this is based on the high sequence 
homology of the JAK family between species, data from other JAK-inhibitors that indicates similar 
inhibitory response between species and that dogs and rabbits has been considered as relevant species 
with these other JAK-inhibitors. Nevertheless, the CHMP reminded the Applicant that cross-reactivity data 
from all species considered for the toxicity testing is expected before actual inclusion in toxicology 
studies. However, this issue was no longer pursued by the CHMP. 
In vitro comparison with other JAK inhibitors 
Filgotinib was compared with other RA associated JAK inhibitors as baricitinib, tofacitinib, and 
upadacitinib. Baricitinib, tofacitinib and upadacitinib are potent inhibitors of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 in 
humans with >10-fold lower IC50 values than filgotinib and 100-fold lower than the filgotinib metabolite 
in biochemical assays. This corroborate with the clinical situation, e.g. that the Cmax at steady state for 
filgotinib (2.6 µg/mL) is approximately 60-times higher than for upadacitinib (~40 ng/mL, Klunder B, 
2019).  
In vivo studies 
In vivo collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rats, a common animal model for RA, were repeatedly used in a 
total of 12 PD studies. The rationale for conducting all these animal trials with overlapping dose 
administrations (doses ranges from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day) and readouts (clinical score, paw swelling, 
Larsen score) is not clear for the CHMP. Nevertheless, from the studies performed in male dark agouti 
(DA) rats it was demonstrated that two weeks treatment resulted in improvements of clinical score at 
lowest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg). Paw swelling was improved after 0.1 mg/kg (study 48) and after 0.3 
mg/kg (study 53). For Larsen score improvement, higher doses were required; in study 46 and 48 the 
highest doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively did not result in any improvement of Larsen score, 
whereas in study 53, 3 mg/kg was associated with a significant effect. In study 51, additional 
histopathology parameters including pannus severity, cell infiltration, cartilage and bone lesions were 
studied at doses between 0.3-30 mg/kg. At 10 mg/kg a decrease in pannus severity was found, whereas 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 21/170 
 
 
 
for the other cartilage and bone sparing parameters studied, no significant improvements were observed 
at the highest dose tested 30 mg/kg. 
From the in vivo CIA studies in DA rats, it can be concluded that for cartilage and bone effects, higher 
doses of filgotinib is needed than for the anti-swelling and clinical effects. Exposure of filgotinib in CIA DA 
rats (as analysed in study 53) revealed that the effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg corresponds to Cmax of 19 
ng/ml whereas 3 mg/kg corresponds to Cmax of 363 ng/m. Hence, both the anti-swelling effects and 
improvement in bone markers are seen at concentrations of clinical relevance.  
Lewis female CIA rats were dosed with 1-10 mg/kg and ankle swelling was improved in the 5 mg/kg bid 
treatment (but not at 10 mg once daily (QD)). The reason for the female CIA rats requiring higher doses 
for anti-swelling effect is not clear and has not been discussed by the Applicant. However, since no gender 
differences have been noted in the human subgroup analyses (assessed as endpoint ACR 20) of trials 
FINCH 1, 2 and 3 (see the clinical section 2.5) this PD and PK differences between CIA models were not 
considered to be of any clinical relevance to the CHMP. Notably, in the PD study in Lewis rats 
(PC-417-2010, 2019), high concentrations corresponding to the intended therapeutic exposure were 
tested but with filgotinib failing to demonstrate any targeted activity. Moreover, similar negative results 
were obtained in PD combination studies, when filgotinib was administrated alone. The Applicant’s 
explanation was that co administration of filgotinib with GS 829845 is necessary to achieve efficacy in PD 
model, which is agreed by the CHMP.  
Efficacy of the combination was evaluated in 3 different studies (in the rat CIA model) with filgotinib and 
GS-829845 administered at different ratio administrated for 2 weeks. Two studies (0148 and 158) were 
performed with three different treatment groups: filgotinib administrated alone, GS-829845 
administrated alone and treatment with the combination. The third study was performed only with the 
combination (ratio 1/20) at different doses; in this recent third study (PC-417-2006, 2019), 
administration of combination filgotinib/GS-829845 showed significant dose-dependent efficacy at 
exposure approximately similar to the human therapeutic exposure. In the two earlier studies (0148 and 
158, 2011 and 2012) the effect of filgotinib on GS-829845 activity (and vice versa) have been studied. 
Controversial results were obtained: in study 158, additive activity was observed when the compounds 
were administered in combination compared to each compound administered alone at the same doses, 
whereas in study 0148, filgotinib antagonised GS-829845 activity when administered in combination. In 
this second study, it was necessary to increase GS-829845 proportion in the ratio to retrieve a PD effect. 
The applicant concluded that the evaluation of filgotinib and GS 829845 co-dosing in rat CIA studies 
showed additive, and not antagonistic, effects of filgotinib and GS 829845 at reducing PD (pSTAT1) and 
demonstrating efficacy in the rat CIA. However, in study 0148, the combination of filgotinib/GS-829845 
at low doses (3/30 mg/kg, respectively) was less effective on all measured parameters (clinical score, 
change of paw swelling and global Larsen score) than filgotinib (3mg/kg) or GS-829845 administered 
alone (30 mg/kg). On the contrary, when the combination filgotinib/GS-829845 was administered at 6/60 
mg/kg an additive effect was observed. In addition, in the more recent study PC-417-2006, when the 
combination filgotinib/GS-829845 was administered at ratio 1/20 and in clinical therapeutic range, low 
additive effects were observed but the overall PD effect was mostly driven (>90%) by the metabolite 
GS-829845. This is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro binding screening and kinase activity profiling were performed in several studies including over 
450 protein kinases, 70 receptors and 22 enzymes. Some kinases displayed IC50 values below the Cmax 
for filgotinib. For some kinase targets competitive inhibition >50 % of ATP binding was observed, e.g. 95 
% inhibition for Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1)and73 % inhibition for Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase 1 (SRPK1).

The Applicant argues that due to higher potency towards JAK1 than to these non-JAK kinases, no 
meaningful impact from these targets are expected. 
The GS-829845 metabolite appears to be more promiscuous than filgotinib itself, binding to around 20 
non-JAK associated kinases in off-target binding assays. When enzymatic inhibition study was conducted, 
two non-JAK kinases were identified, i.e. Aurora B Kinase (AURB) (IC50 1.5 µM) and FMS (IC50 3.6 µM). 
Two follow up cell assays were conducted with AURB (a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation) concluding 
that AURB was not inhibited when concentration up to 10 µM filgotinib were tested. Surprisingly 
GS-829845 was not tested in any of these experiments and hence it cannot be concluded if GS-829845 
possesses any AURB off-target effects at clinically relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, as the toxicity 
studies have not identified any specific GS-829845 related concerns, off-target binding by GS-829845 is 
most likely not of clinical relevance.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In the safety pharmacology studies, filgotinib and GS-829845 had no effect on the central nervous system 
and respiratory system in rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg. The dose of 180 mg/kg corresponds to 
concentrations >10.3 ug/mL and > 29 ug/mL (no PK data provided 180 mg/kg), resulting in exposure 
margins above 10-fold and 8-fold, respectively. In the in vitro human ERG assay, low liability for delayed 
rectifier potassium current (Ikr) inhibition was seen with both filgotinib and GS-829845 at the lowest dose 
tested (10 uM). This corresponds to exposure margin of around 2-fold for both filgotinib and GS-829845. 
No QTc effects were observed in the dogs with highest dose tested which corresponds to exposure margin 
around 2.5 - 7-fold for filgotinib and GS-829845 metabolite, respectively. However, in clinical studies a 
minor QT prolongation (<10 msec) have been observed at supra-physiological doses that was considered 
of no clinical concern. 
In the cardiovascular (CV) studies in dogs, oral administration of filgotinib did not impact on any CV 
parameters. The metabolite GS-829845 on the other hand, increased heart rate (HR) (+41-52 bpm) and 
decreased blood pressure (BP) (up to 25 mmHg) at 100 mg/kg. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(NOAEL) (25 mg/kg) corresponds to exposure margins of 7 (based on Cmax). The clinical relevance of 
GC-829845 induced increase in HR and decrease BP in dogs is probably low, since this have not been 
reported as a concern in the toxicity studies or the human clinical trial TOT-study, where 
supra-physiological doses of filgotinib were administered. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No formal drug interaction study was conducted in animals which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical PK of filgotinib was evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies conducted in mice, 
rats, dogs, minipigs, rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys. 
The absorption of filgotinib was studied in vitro in Caco-2 cells and in vivo after single dosing to rats, 
mouse, dog, rabbit, minipigs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Filgotinib’s transepithelial permeability was 
high, and filgotinib was rapidly absorbed in all species tested. The clearance was low and distribution 
volumes greater than total body water in all species with T1/2 times between 4-10 hours. 
Binding to plasma proteins of filgotinib and the GS-829845 metabolite were low (25-70%) in all species 
studied, including humans. In human hepatic microsomes a free fraction of 86% and 95% were observed. 
In tissue distribution studies in rats with radiolabelled filgotinib, the highest radioactive concentrations

were detected in uveal tract and urinary bladder. Of note; after 48 hours, filgotinib was retained in 
epididymis. No placental transfers or milk excretion studies were conducted. 
The in vitro studies indicate that the main metabolite GS-829845 is formed by first passage metabolism 
predominantly by CES2. In humans, the exposure (AUC) of GS-829845 are 16-21 fold higher than the 
AUC for filgotinib. Neither of the species used in non-clinical studies show the same exposure ratios 
(highest AUC ratio of 1.57 was found in mice). Consequently, the GS-829845 needed to be separately 
studied and accordingly the Applicant has conducted repeat toxicity, genotoxicity, repro toxicity and 
cancer studies with this metabolite. It is estimated that around 20% of administered filgotinib is 
metabolized to cyclopropane carboxylic (CPCA)-carnitine. Mouse and dog appear to be the nonclinical 
species that are adequality exposed for this metabolite. 
The studies indicate that faecal elimination is the dominant route (59%) in dog, whereas in rat, urinary 
excretion is more common (59%). In humans, 87% of administered dose of radioactively labelled 
compound was excreted in urine and 15% in feces. 
The toxicological profile of filgotinib has been evaluated in non-clinical studies in agreement with relevant 
guidelines. In addition, the major human metabolite GS-829845, which in animal species is formed 
following dosing of filgotinib, was also assessed as multiples of the observed human GS-829845 exposure 
could only be achieved after co-dosing or administration of GS-829845 alone. In human whole blood 
assays, GS-829845 is approximately 10-fold less active than filgotinib, while having a similar JAK-1 
selectivity profile. Overall, the toxicity profile of filgotinib (and GS-829845) has been characterized via 
repeat dose toxicity (up to 1 month in CB6F1-nonTgrasH2mice, 6 months in Sprague Dawley rats and 9 
months in beagle dogs), genotoxicity (filgotinib only), carcinogenicity studies in Sprague Dawley rats (2 
years study) and CB6F1-TgrasH2 mice (6 months study), reproductive and developmental toxicity studies 
in Sprague Dawley rats and New Zealand White rabbits, juvenile toxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, 
local tolerance, and phototoxicity studies. 
The oral route of administration was utilized in all toxicity studies to match the intended clinical 
administration route.

The Sprague Dawley rat and Beagle dog were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent species in the 
general toxicity studies. The Sprague Dawley rat and the CB6F1-TgrasH2 mouse were selected for the 
carcinogenicity studies and reproductive studies were conducted in Sprague Dawley rat and New Zeeland 
White rabbits.

As discussed in the pharmacological section, data on JAK inhibitory effects in mice and rats have indicated 
that there is a cross-reactivity in these species which could qualify them as relevant toxicological species. 
No such data has been presented for dogs and rabbits.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity was tested in dogs and was conducted as the first part of a two-part study. Animals 
were dosed up to 100mg/kg/day. No lethality was identified. Clinical signs as vomiting (vehicle 1 and 3) 
and hypersalivation (vehicle 2) was observed at the highest dose. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In all pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, except for rat 4-week study, animals were administered with 
filgotinib or with the metabolite GS-829845 alone. The main organs and tissues affected were primarily 
male reproductive organs (testes and epididymides) and lymphoid organs and tissues. 
Mortality 
In the non-pivotal 7-day study in mice the highest dose (500 mg/kg/day) were tolerated. In the 
subsequent pivotal 4-week mice study doses of 50, 500 and 1500 mg/kg/day were selected. Two 
mortalities considered to be related to filgotinib occurred in the high dose group, one animal died on day 
3 and with clinical signs of poor condition on day 1-3 in all remaining high dose animals, the dose was 
thereafter reduced to 1000 mg/kg. At this dose the second mortality occurred on day 26. However, 
exposure measured on day 28 (3 days with 1500 mg/kg followed by 1000 mg/kg for 25 days) were 
several multiples (AUC 27-44 times; Cmax 23-times) compared to the clinical dose at 200 mg/kg/day. No 
mortalities occurred at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day with GS-829845.  
No test-article related deaths occurred in rats.  
In dogs no test-article related deaths occurred in the 13-week study. In the longer 26 and 39-week 
studies mid and/or high doses were adjusted due to unexpected clinical signs and premature sacrifice. 
The applicant considered these deaths related to misdosing/aspiration of compound in lungs. With the 
new dose settings one female dosed with 10 mg/kg/day of filgotinib were prematurely sacrificed due too 
poor clinical condition considered related to filgotinib. Among other findings, pronounced lesions in the 
buccal cavity and gastrointestinal tract lymphoid atrophy was observed in the thymus, spleen, GALT and 
mesenteric lymph node. The dose of filgotinib at 10 mg/kg/day corresponded to a 7.8-fold AUC exposure 
compared to a clinical dose or 200 mg. 
Male reproductive organs 
Male reproductive organs were affected after administration of filgotinib in all toxicological species. No 
corresponding effects were observed after administration of the metabolite GS-829845 alone in rats and 
dogs, except in the pivotal 13-week dog study at doses ≥ 20 mg/kg/day. In mice effects were observed 
only in single animals at high dose with GS-829845. The effects appeared at different exposure levels 
across the species with dog being most sensitive. In dogs, effects were observed already after 4-weeks of 
administration while in rat effects were seen after 13 weeks. In rats and dogs, there were no profound 
changes of the findings with longer duration of administration. The observed lesions consisted of germ cell 
depletion/degeneration and/or tubular vacuolation in testis with correlating findings in epididymides 
(reduced sperm content and/or increased cell debris). In the 4-week mice study, adverse effect was 
observed from 500 mg/kg/day, however effects were also observed at 150 mg/kg/day consisting of 
minimal to moderate testicular atrophy/degeneration with minimal to slight sloughed cells in the 
epididymides, but these findings were not considered as adverse effects by the applicant. The findings in 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 26/170 
 
 
 
male reproductive organs was the most profound lesions for the NOAEL setting. In male rats, findings of 
up to marked/severe grade in testis and epididymides was observed from a dose of 45 kg/mg/day in the 
26-week study and the NOAEL was set to 20 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 2.3-fold marginal to the 
clinical AUC exposure at 200 mg. In dogs, corresponding adverse effects were observed from 5 
mg/kg/day in the 26-week study and at 10 mg/kg/day in the 39-week study. There was no or very low 
(0.9 and 1.7-fold) AUC exposure marginals at NOAEL compared to the clinical exposure at 200 mg in dogs 
after 26 and 39 weeks of administration, respectively. 
At LOAEL for male reproductive organs generally no changes of hormonal levels or seminology 
parameters was observed except for increased luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in rats. At higher doses 
(and exposure) a decrease of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and inhibin levels was 
observed in rats. In dogs, no changes of testosterone or FSH levels were observed at any dose. 
A recovery group was included in the 13-week study in rats which showed persisting findings in testes 
(minimal to moderate) and epididymides (minimal to severe) after 8 weeks of recovery when dosed at 
180 mg/kg/day (only high dose animals were included). In dogs treated for 13-weeks and after 8 weeks 
of recovery a reduced sperm counts, and number of normal sperms persisted without microscopic 
findings in testes or epididymides. No recovery groups were included in longer-term rat and dog repeat 
dose toxicity studies which would have been beneficial to better characterize potential reversibility of 
observed toxicity. 
In the male fertility study in rat, comparable changes of male reproductive organ as described above 
occurred after administration with filgotinib. 
The applicant has conducted a mechanistic study in rats to investigate testicular toxicity including a 
genomic analysis. According to the applicant, filgotinib did not affect the transcription of genes relevant to 
the JAK pathway in testis and the gene expression observed did not match any profile published or within 
public database and suggests that the testicular toxicity represent a novel mechanism. 
Immune system 
Effects consistent with the inhibition of JAK1/3 were observed in nearly all dose levels in repeated dose 
toxicity studies of all species assessed after administration of either filgotinib or GS-829845. These effects 
included decreases in circulating lymphocytes (T-cells; total, helper and cytotoxic) and natural killer (NK) 
cells, and decreased cellularity and/or lymphoid depletion in lymphoid tissues. 
In rats at filgotinib doses from 100 mg/kg adverse effects was observed with up to frequent and severe 
effects on multiple lymphoid tissues and a 70-75% decrease of circulating lymphocytes. In dogs, the 
effects on lymphoid tissues and circulating lymphocytes appeared milder. The NOAEL for JAK-1 related 
changes were with filgotinib 45 mg/kg/day in rat and 5 mg/kg/day in dogs corresponding to 6-fold and 
1.8-fold, respectively, compared to the AUC clinical exposure at 200mg/kg. 
Altered immune function-secondary effects 
In dogs, the main manifestation of immunosuppression was the occurrence of infections. Demodex spp. 
is a mite considered to be normal flora of the dog skin which is otherwise controlled by the innate immune 
system. In the 39-week study, parasites consistent with Demodex spp. was confirmed in all high dose 
males and in 2/5 low dose males (2.5 mg/kg, clinical exposure) but associated macroscopic findings 
(cutaneous lesions recorded as increased size of erythema, desquamation, alopecia, thickening and 
swelling, and wounds and scabs) and marked granulomatous inflammation were observed only in high 
dose males.

Haematopoietic system 
Decreases of red blood cell (RBC) parameters (red blood cell, haemoglobin and haematocrit) and 
reticulocytes which are effects consistent with JAK-2 inhibition were observed in mice, rats and dogs 
administrated with filgotinib but no obvious corresponding effects in animals administrated with 
GS-829845. In rats, reduced RBC parameters were observed at doses from 100 mg/kg/day and in dogs 
at 5 mg/kg/day with NOAEL at 45 mg/kg/day in rat and 2.5 mg/kg/day in dogs corresponding to 6-fold 
and 1.1-fold, respectively, compared to the AUC clinical exposure at 200mg/kg. However, no changes in 
prolactin levels were observed in rats. 
Teeth 
Filgotinib related effects on incisor teeth was observed in the 26-week rat study. At 45 mg/kg/day 
changes in the lower incisor tooth enamel, termed striae, was observed and at 100 mg/kg/day the 
changes included slight to marked degeneration/loss/disorganization of ameloblast accompanied with 
malformed enamel. The NOAEL for these findings was set to 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to 2.8-fold of 
the clinical AUC exposure at 200 mg/kg. No corresponding findings were observed in juvenile rats (up to 
postnatal day 183) dosed up to 20 mg/kg/day. Filgotinib related findings in incisor teeth was not observed 
in mice or dogs. The applicant considered these findings not relevant for humans due to that, unlike in 
man, rat incisors grow throughout their lives and are therefore continuously depositing new enamel while 
in humans enamel formation is complete once secondary dentition is finished, generally, in the late teens. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development  
Two separate studies were conducted to evaluate male and female fertility potential and embryonic 
development in rats after administration of filgotinib and the metabolite GS-829845. Profound effects 
were observed after administration with filgotinib but not with GS-829845. 
In the first study using untreated males, females were treated with filgotinib at 15, 30 and 60mg/kg/day 
or with 60 and 180 mg/kg/day with GS-829845. Dosing of 60 mg/kg/day with filgotinib resulted with 
adverse effects on mean % post implantation loss which was due to an increase mean number of early 
and late resorptions. In the second study males were treated with filgotinib at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day 
or with GS-829845 at 60 and 180 mg/kg/day. Severe effects on male fertility was observed at 60 
mg/kg/day with up to marked changes in testis and epididymides, sperm quality and quantity and fertility 
index of 5% compared control animals (95%). Only one female that mated with males at this dose 
became pregnant. No toxicokinetic was performed which was acceptable to the CHMP. The NOAEL for 
filgotinib was set to 30 mg/kg/day which in the pivotal 13-week study corresponded to approximately a 
3-fold AUC exposure marginal to the clinical daily dose at 200 mg. 
Embryo-foetal development  
Embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits administrated with filgotinib or 
GS-829845. Rats were dosed with filgotinib at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg or with GS-829845 at 60 and 180 
mg/kg/day and rabbits were dosed with filgotinib at 10, 25 and 60 mg/kg or with GS-829845 at 60 and 
150 mg/kg/day. Profound effects were observed in both species after administration with filgotinib or with 
GS-829845. In rats, increased post implantation loss and a decrease number of live foetuses and foetal 
body weight were observed at high filgotinib dose (100mg/kg). Visceral and/or skeletal abnormalities 
occurred at all doses with filgotinib and GS-829845. Dose-related increase in incidence of abnormalities 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 28/170 
 
 
 
included, among others, vertebrate and sternal abnormalities, rudimentary ribs, dilated/convoluted 
ureter, internal hydrocephaly, and absent or small eyes. No NOAEL was established. The AUC exposure at 
the lowest dose corresponded to 2.4-fold (filgotinib) and 1.7-fold (GS-829845) to the clinical exposure at 
200 mg. Similar effects was observed in rabbits including increased post implantation loss and a decrease 
number of live foetuses and foetal body weight at high doses and visceral and/or skeletal abnormalities at 
all dose levels. No NOAEL was established. The AUC exposure at the lowest dose corresponded to 1.4-fold 
(filgotinib) and 4.9-fold (GS-829845) to the clinical exposure at 200 mg. 
Prenatal and postnatal development 
The potential effects of filgotinib and GS-829845 on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive 
performance and fertility of F1 generation were evaluated in rats at doses of 2, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day 
(filgotinib) or 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (GS-829845). No adverse effects occurred at any dose in the study. 
The AUC exposure at the highest dose of filgotinib (15 mg/kg/day) and GS-829845 (30 mg/kg/day) 
corresponded to a 1.2-fold and 0.8-fold marginal, respectively, to the clinical dose at 200 mg/kg/day. It 
is considered that this study is not conclusive due to the low exposure of the animals. 
Juvenile toxicity 
The current application concerns an indication in for treatment in adults only, therefore juvenile toxicity 
studies are considered to be of low relevance for this application. However, in the pivotal juvenile toxicity 
study conducted in Sprague Dawley rats no adverse findings occurred at administrations up to 20 
mg/kg/day (filgotinib) or 90 mg/kg/day (GS-829845) corresponding to 2.2-fold of the clinical AUC 
exposure at 200 mg/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
Filgotinib did not induce mutations when adequately tested in five histidine-requiring strains of 
Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA102) at concentrations up to 5000 
μg/plate in the absence and in the presence of a rat liver metabolic activation system (S9). In the in vitro 
mammalian chromosome aberration test in mouse lymphoma cells, filgotinib was negative at dose levels 
up to 500 µg/mL (signs of cytotoxicity were noted at levels of 5.1 µg/mL and above). In the two in vivo 
chromosomal aberration test (micronucleus) filgotinib was not clastogenic at doses up to 45 mg/kg or 
1000 mg/kg. In the latter study the high mortality occurred at the high dose 2000 mg/kg and was not 
considered relevant by the applicant for micronucleus scoring. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term study 
In the 2-year rat study the animals were dosed up to 45 mg/kg/day with filgotinib or with GS-829845 up 
to 75 mg/kg/day. The applicant selected the dose levels based on immunosuppression observed at higher 
doses in rats in previous studies and according to recommendations from Executive CAC. The exposure 
multiples for the maximum dose in male and female rats relative to the 200 mg clinical dose were 2.6 and 
5-fold -fold for filgotinib and approximately 2-fold for GS-829845. Toxicity was observed from mid-dose 
with filgotinib and the exposure at the highest dose of the metabolite GS-829845 exceeded the clinical 
exposure at 200mg/kg. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the animals have been adequately exposed.

An increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma was observed at 45 mg/kg filgotinib while no 
corresponding findings were observed with the metabolite GS-829845 (see Table 2). Other findings 
observed were similar to those observed in repeated toxicity studies including changes in male 
reproductive organs (testes and epididymides) at 45 mg/kg/day and lymphoid tissue at 15 mg/kg.

The applicant considered the increased Leydig cell tumours to be related to a rat-specific mechanism 
involving increasing levels of LH that is linked to increase in rat Leydig cells tumours referring to Cook et 
al. 1999  and Chapin 2016 who further states that rat Leydig cells are considerably more sensitive to LH 
than human Leydig cells due to an increased number of LH receptors and an increased sensitivity. In the 
rat repeated toxicity studies filgotinib induced increased levels of LH (at 45 mg/kg daily dose for 39-weeks 
the LH levels increased with a 2-fold and dosing of 180 mg/kg increases were 6-fold compared to control 
animals) and Leydig cell hyperplasia at 60 mg/kg. 
Short-term study 
The 6 months study in mice resulted in no neo-plastic lesions after administration of filgotinib or the 
metabolite GS-829845. Non-neoplastic changes were seen in male reproductive organs after 
administration of filgotinib at 150 mg/kg/day similar to those observed in rat repeated toxicity studies at 
corresponding dosing although with milder grades of severity. Dose setting was based on 
immunosuppression observed at higher doses in the 4-week mouse study and according to 
recommendations from Executive CAC. The AUC exposure at the maximum doses tested relative to the 
200 mg clinical dose was approximately a 6-fold for filgotinib and 8-fold for GS-829845. Toxicity was 
observed at high-dose with filgotinib and the exposure at the highest dose of the metabolite GS-829845 
exceeded the clinical exposure at 200mg/kg. Therefore, the animals are considered being adequately 
exposed. 
Toxicokinetics  
Toxicokinetic assessment of filgotinib was included in all pivotal repeated-dose toxicology studies 
conducted in mice, rats and dogs after oral administration. In the rat 13 and 26-weeks studies and in all 
dog studies measurement of the human metabolite GS829845 after administration of filgotinib or with 
GS-829845 alone. Administration of GS-829845 alone was performed to reach multiples of exposure 
observed in humans. In mice, plasma exposures of filgotinib and GS-829845 were higher in males 
compared with female mice. The exposure proportionality varied between doses. In rats, filgotinib 
exposure increased 2-fold after 13 and 26 weeks in both genders as well as GS-829845 exposure after 26 
weeks dosing with GS-829845. There were no significant differences between genders in rats.  
Local Tolerance  
Dermal and ocular irritation and testing has been made for filgotinib. By a mouse local lymph node assay 
and the Episkin reconstructed epidermis model, and by a bovine corneal opacity assay it was shown that 
filgotinib was not a skin irritating and non-corrosive and that filgotinib was a mild ocular irritant.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Specific immunotoxicity studies with filgotinib or GS-829845 was not performed. Considering the results 
in toxicological studies with decreases in white blood cells, T cells (total, helper and cytotoxic), and NK 
cells, decreased cellularity and/or lymphoid depletion in lymphoid tissues, and in one dog study an 
increased susceptibility to parasitic infection (Demodex spp.), it is clear that filgotinib and GS-829845 
induces immune suppression. The CHMP considered that this is consistent with the action of mode and as 
such not unexpected. 
Metabolites 
The primary human metabolite GS-829845 has been evaluated in several non-clinical studies in parallel 
with filgotinib. GS-829845 standalone studies included mutagenic activity in bacterial reverse mutation 
testing, mouse lymphoma assay, bone marrow nucleus test, repeated toxicity studies in rat and dogs, and 
a photoxicity test with negative result. GS-829845 is considered to pose no risk for a genotoxic or 
phototoxic potential. 
Impurities 
An impurity qualification study has been conducted with filgotinib in rats for 4 weeks including two 
filgotinib lots. No unexpected adverse effects were observed from filgotinib-related process impurities. 
The Applicant investigated potential impurities. The Applicant performed directly in vivo genotoxicity 
studies on impurities GS 831208 and GS 830681. This strategy was based on literature references for in 
vitro results and the PigA and Comet assays selection. 
Phototoxicity 
In a 3T3 NRU mouse fibroblast assay it was shown that filgotinib was a potential phototoxic product with 
a Photo Impact Factor of 2.9 and Mean Photo Effect of 0.12. In a following in vivo phototoxicity study in 
Long Evans rats dosed with either filgotinib up to 180 mg/kg/day or GS-829845 up to 360 mg/kg/day for 
3 days, no signs of phototoxicity was observed of either molecule. It can be concluded that filgotinib or 
GS-829845 pose no risk for phototoxicity. 
Combination studies  
Two combinations studies were performed with filgotinib/GS-829845 (ratio 1/6), one in rats and on in 
dogs with a 14-day treatment. The performance of these two studies was not justified or explained 
(selection of the duration or the doses). As there are pilot studies, it seems reasonable that the original 
plan was to perform longer studies. Moreover, filgotinib/GS-829845 ratio observed is human was 1/15 
and not 1/6 as originally observed in phase I. 
Regarding pilot study in dogs, no NOAEL could be established in view of immaturity of the male 
reproductive organs. Given the toxicity profile previously described, it is not acceptable and unnecessary 
that sexually immature dogs were used in this study and not in line with the 3Rs principles.  
Regarding the pilot study in rats, filgotinib/GS-829845 was administrated for 14 days and the ratio 
filgotinib/GS-829845 was 1/6. Effects on lymphoid system and male reproductive system were observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 31/170 
 
 
 
at all doses, these reproductive effects were considered adverse at mid- and high-dose (30/180 and 
60/360 mg/kg/d) but not at low dose (10/60 mg/kg/d) given the low severity and the absence of 
correlating findings in epididymis. Therefore, the NOAEL was determined at this low dose, 
filgotinib/GS-829845 10/60 mg/kg/day. The Applicant stated that effects noted in the combination 
studies were comparable to those seen at similar exposures in individual repeat-dose studies of the two 
compounds. However, NOAEL determined for the combination (10/60 mg/kg/day) was lower than the 
NOAEL determined when filgotinib and GS-829845 were separately administrated (filgotinib 4-w study: 
NOAEL > 45 mg/kg/d, 13-w and 26w-studies: 20 mg/kg/day and GS-829845 no effect on male 
reproductive system up to 26 weeks, NOAEL > 180 mg/kg/day). Therefore, the absence of impact of the 
combination filgotinib/GS-829845 in terms of safety is questionable.  
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA for the active substance filgotinib was performed in accordance with the CHMP guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 
2). 
The Phase I “worst case” PECsurfacewater of 1.28 µg/L increased to 2.12 µg/L following refinement based 
on prevalence data. The log Kow < 3 and filgotinib is not considered as a PBT or bioaccumulative 
substance. 
A Phase II, Tier A assessment was provided. Filgotinib was not readily degraded and was found very 
persistent is sediment. Significant distribution to the sediment compartment was observed and a Phase 
II, Tier B assessment for sediment was provided. The Koc values below the limit of 1000 L/kg and a Phase 
II, Tier B terrestrial assessment is not required. 
Studies on sewage microorganisms and freshwater aquatic organisms, representing three tropic levels 
have been performed using FIL DS, in accordance with current guidelines. No significant effects on the 
respiration of sewage sludge microorganisms, the early life stage of freshwater fish, or the growth of 
green freshwater algae, at their respective highest tested concentrations were observed. The no observed 
effect concentration (NOEC) for sewage sludge, freshwater green algae, and early life stages of 
freshwater fish were concluded to be ≥1000 mg·L-1, 5 mg·L-1, and 2.6 mg·L-1, respectively. The most 
sensitive taxonomic group tested was the freshwater invertebrate, Daphnia magna. Significant reduction 
in neonate production were observed at a FIL DS concentration of 2.6 mg·L-1. Based on this effect the 
NOEC was concluded to be 0.83 mg·L-1. In the sediment toxicity study in Chironomus riparius no effects 
on emergence ratio or development rates was observed and the NOEC was concluded to be 72.9 
mg·kgdwt-1. 
The calculated risk quotients were all below 1 and it can be concluded that no environmental effects are 
expected following the use of filgotinib.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The preclinical studies are submitted in accordance with legal requirements and available guidelines. 
Scientific advice on non-clinical developmental program has been received and the CHMP advice have 
been adequately followed.  
Pharmacology 
A series of in vitro and in vivo studies (biochemical assays, cell experiments, whole blood assays and 
collagen induced arthritis (CIA)) have been conducted in order to characterize the primary pharmacology 
of filgotinib and the major metabolite GS-829845. In vitro it was demonstrated that filgotinib is a JAK 
family inhibitor. Filgotinib treatment of CIA in rats resulted in variable improvements of RA-similar clinical 
symptoms. The GS-829845 also exerts JAK inhibitory effects (with ~10 fold less potency) and when 
co-administered with filgotinib in the same exposure ratio as seen in humans enhanced PD effects were 
seen in the CIA rat model. In addition, primary pharmacodynamic studies have been done to compare

filgotinib with other JAK inhibitors. The SmPC 5.1 text, initially suggested by the Applicant, claiming that 
filgotinib is a “selective JAK1 inhibitor”, was not agreed on. Filgotinib has not been convincingly 
demonstrated to be a specific JAK1 inhibitor as filgotinib (and/or GS-829845) may inhibit several of the 
JAK family members within the clinical Cmax; this is adequately reflected in the Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Extensive off-target screening studies of over 450 kinases, 40 receptors and 22 enzymes have been 
performed with filgotinib and the main metabolite GS-829845. Filgotinib and GS-829845 appears to bind 
to some non JAK-kinase proteins at concentration below and near the clinical Cmax of ~6 µM and 9.8 µM, 
respectively. The clinical consequences of these putative bindings are unknown and was not discussed by 
the Applicant in the initial MAA. However, in the context of a question on the toxicity findings on the male 
reproductive system, clinical consequences were partly discussed. Some potential off-target molecules 
were scrutinized by the Applicant but without identifying any plausible mechanism for these toxicities. 
In vitro binding screening and kinase activity profiling were performed in several studies including over 
450 protein kinases, 70 receptors and 22 enzymes. Some kinases displayed IC50 values below the Cmax 
for filgotinib. For some kinase targets, competitive inhibition >50 % of ATP binding was observed, e.g. 95 
% inhibition of LKB1 and 73 % inhibition of SRPK1. The Applicant argued that due to higher activity 
towards JAK1 than to these non-JAK kinases, no meaningful impact from these targets are expected. The 
CHMP did not agree with this argument. Even though filgotinib show 5 to 44-fold lower activity towards 
other kinases than to JAK1 itself, it is possible that filgotinib may interact with these non-JAK kinases at 
clinically relevant exposures. It is possible that such interaction may lead to non-traditionally JAK 
associated toxicity and adverse findings, e.g. testis toxicity (for example, in the in vitro screening study 
159 some of the kinases (LKB1 and SRPK1) identified are highly abundant in testis and have been 
associated with spermatogenesis). The Applicant was invited to provide a discussion on what potential 
secondary pharmacodynamic effects off-target binding may results in, focusing on potentially interaction 
related to testis toxicity. Thus, the applicant discussed literature findings for LKB1 and SRPK1 but without 
being able to identify any mechanism that could explain the testis toxicity. In addition, the Applicant did 
not find any relevant data in the literature regarding potential effects of inhibiting FLT4, STK16, or YSK4 
(MAP3K19).  
Furthermore, a reanalysis of the original microarray dataset was performed in order to determine whether 
newer databases or methodologies could provide additional functional insights. Upon CHMP’s request, the 
applicant submitted this reanalysis, along with a discussion on the study results but without being able to 
provide new insights on the mechanism of testicular toxicity (please, see also the non-clinical toxicology 
section 2.3.3. ). 
Overall, the applicant has not been able to identify a viable mechanism for the decreased fertility, 
impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs. It appears the 
search has been mostly focused on identifying a single mechanism/target as a cause of the observed 
toxicities. It could have been considered whether the findings on the male reproductive system are due to 
a combination of factors/mechanisms. However, the main focus for the CHMP is to understand whether 
the findings are clinically relevant. To this end, the data from the ongoing clinical MANTA study evaluating 
the impact on male fertility is expected to provide the most relevant information. The Applicant should 
submit the results of this study (see RMP- Section 2.7. ). 
No safety concerns have been identified in the safety pharmacology studies conducted with filgotinib and 
its main metabolite GS-829845. Some minor CV effects on HR and BP were noted but is considered to not 
be of clinical relevance. 
In summary, from the in vitro studies it can be concluded that filgotinib, in the experimental setting, 
preferentially inhibits JAK1/JAK2 whereas JAK3 and TYK2 are inhibited to less degree but still at 
concentrations that may be of clinical relevance. The main metabolite GS-829845 displays 10-fold lower 
potency for all the JAKs as compared to filgotinib. The human cellular studies demonstrated that filgotinib 
Assessment report

Page 34/170 
 
 
 
(and GS-829845 metabolite) inhibit signalling mediated by the cytokines IL6, IL2 and IFNα at clinically 
relevant concentrations. In rat CIA RA models, filgotinib treatment resulted in reduction of RA similar 
parameters. The PD effects were improved when co-administered with the GS-829845 metabolite. The 
overall PD effect in the animal model was mostly driven (>90%) by the metabolite GS-829845, which is 
reflected in SmPC in section 5.1. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The bioanalytical LC/MS/MS method used for quantification of filgotinib and its metabolite GS-829845 in 
the pivotal toxicity studies of rats, mice, rabbits and dogs have been performed according to GLP 
standard. 
Absorption 
In vivo the absorption of Filgotinib was studied in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys and minipigs after 
oral and i.v. single dose administration. After oral administration Filgotinib is rapidly absorbed in all 
species studied with Tmax occurring after 1-2 hours. In all species the clearance is moderate/high 
(1.87-2.87 L/h/kg) and volume of distribution greater than total body water volume.   
The bioavailability of filgotinib after oral intake ranges between 25 % and 82 % (being lowest in monkeys 
and highest in mouse) are indicative of various grades of first pass metabolism. The half-time (T ½) of 10 
hours (mice), 8 h (monkeys) and 4.5-6 h (dog), 4 h (rat and rabbit) after PO intake is similar as the 
half-time seen in humans (5 h).  
Rats, rabbits and dogs were also administered with GS-829845 to further study the PK parameters of this 
major metabolite. Single dose oral administration of the GS-829845 showed rapid absorption with Tmax 
1-2 hours and half-life of 7 hours (rats), 6 hours (rabbit) and 9 hours (dogs), i.e. somewhat longer 
half-life than the parent compound filgotinib. 
No PK data after repeat dosing were presented in the PKs overview but instead the Applicant referred to 
TK data from rat and dog toxicity studies. TK data after repeat dose of filgotinib did not indicate any 
evidence of accumulation of filgotinib and the GS-829845 metabolite, and no gender differences were 
discerned (see toxicology section 2.3.3. ).  
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of filgotinib and GS-829845 have been studied in mouse, rat, rabbit, 
dog, monkey and human. In all species, filgotinib and the metabolite show similar protein binding profile. 
The unbound fraction varies from 35-75 % with similar intra and inter-species differences. It was 
concluded that HSA (albumin) and AAG (alpha-1 acid glycoprotein) are the main plasma proteins involved 
(study GLPG0634-PK-002). When studied in presence of human hepatic microsomes, the unbound 
fraction of filgotinib and GS-829845 were only 14 and 5 %, respectively. Both filgotinib and GS metabolite 
showed whole blood/plasma concentrations around 1 in all species including humans.  
The tissue distribution of total radioactivity in pigmented and non-pigmented rats were monitored 
following single oral dose administration and quantified by whole-body autoradiography. The distribution 
was studied with two different labelled variants; 14C-carboxy-Filgotinib and 14C-GS-Filgotinib. The later 
when hydrolysed, the GS-829845 metabolite is formed and consequently the total radioactivity will be a 
result of both filgotinib and the metabolite. Both the labelled filgotinib variants were rapidly absorbed and 
widely distributed through a variety of tissues reaching peak concentrations within 1 hour post 
administration in most tissues. According to the applicant, similar distribution with filgotinib and its 
metabolite GS-829845 is shown justified by the physiochemical properties, plasma and blood binding, PK 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 35/170 
 
 
 
and distribution data, which is agreed. However, total distribution of GS-829845 was detailed neither in 
animal nor in human. This issue was no longer pursue by the CHMP.  
High concentrations were found in the gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary bladder, consistent with 
elimination pathways with urine and faeces. Another notably finding was that highest concentrations were 
detected in uveal tract of the eye which declined after 5 hours. The concentrations of radioactivity were 
about 2-3 fold higher in pigmented skin than non-pigmented. The Applicant stated the lipophilic weak 
bases are known to be associated with melanin containing tissues and should not lead to any clinical 
consequences. The CHMP agreed, as filgotinib was evaluated in phototoxicity studies with the conclusion 
that filgotinib is not phototoxic (see toxicology section 2.3.3. ).  
In the testis, radioactivity was below the limit of quantification by 48 hours in bothrat studies, and 
concentrations at the other time points were similar or lower than observed in many other tissues. 
However, for the 14C-carboxy-filgotinib, a high concentration was observed in epididymides that 
remained the same after 24 h and after 48 hours post administration, i.e. in accordance with retention 
that have occurred. Since no time points after 48 h were included, it is not possible to evaluate the 
half-life time of filgotinib in epididymis. Nor is it possible to see if repeat-dosing may result in 
accumulation. No discussion of this notably finding was given by the Applicant. When 14C-filgotinib was 
used in the distribution studies, the same retention of radioactivity in epididymides was not found. The 
applicant explain that it is the different label positions of 14C-filgotinib and 14C-carboxy that accounts for 
the different distribution profiles in rats in that the [14C] carboxy filgotinib represent filgotinib , 
cyclopropane carboxylic acid (CPCA) and its metabolites while  [14C] filgotinib represent filgotinib, GS 
829845 and its metabolites. Indeed, greater [14C] carboxy levels compared to [14C] filgotinib levels 
would indicate the presence of CPCA and/or CPCA conjugates as observed in epididymis. This justification 
was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Only 0.5 % of the total radioactivity was detected in the brain regardless of labelling variant used, so 
passing through the blood brain barrier appears low. The Applicant did not conduct any distribution 
studies to study if filgotinib was passing through placenta or excreted in milk. From repro and juvenile 
toxicity studies it can be concluded that filgotinib can be quantified in new-born pups of exposed mothers, 
as well in the milk of lactating mothers. This information is reflected in pre-clinical section 5.3 of the 
SmPC. 
Metabolism  
In vitro metabolism studies were conducted in hepatocytes from mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human. 
Three metabolites were identified, of which MF-2 (later known as GS-829845) was the only metabolite 
identified over 10 % of total radioactivity. Hence the other two metabolites MF-1 and MF-3 are of less 
relevance for toxicity studies.  
In vivo filgotinib metabolism were studied in transgenic mouse, rat, dog and human but not in rabbit. 
Since embryo-foetal developmental studies were performed in rabbit, the Applicant, upon request, 
presented the metabolism pathway also in this species. All detected metabolites were comparable to 
those in the other animal species and in human. 
In the transgenic mouse and in human, GS-8298845 was identified as the major circulating metabolite 
with radioactivity corresponding to 57 and 92 %. After single dose administration of filgotinib the 
concentrations of the main metabolite GS-829845 were analysed in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, minipig, 
and rabbit, and an exposures ratio between AUC for GS829845 and filgotinib were calculated. The AUC 
metabolite-to-parent ratio for AUC at steady state were below 1 in rat, dog, monkey, minipig and rabbit 
whereas in the mouse, GS-829845 was found at higher concentrations than filgotinib itself (AUC ratio of 
1.57). This clearly demonstrates that neither of the non-clinical species are subject to an exposure ratio 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 36/170 
 
 
 
of clinical relevance (the metabolite to parent ratio for AUC ratio in humans is 16-21). Therefore, the 
Applicant has carried out specific toxicity studies (REPRO toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity and 
cancer studies) with GS-S829845 in order to evaluate the toxicity of GS-829845 itself and when 
co-administered with filgotinib in ratios mimicking the exposure ratio in humans.  
The conjugated metabolite CPCA carnitine was not detected as a radioactive metabolite due to the 
labelling position but was estimated to be around 20 % of total drug exposure in humans. As this 
metabolite is formed in dog and mouse with similar exposure rates (Cmax and AUC) this metabolite is 
considered to have been sufficiently assessed in dog and mouse throughout the toxicity studies. 
So, in summary, from a PK point of view the species (i.e. rats, dogs, rabbits and mice) used in the toxicity 
studies of filgotinib have been adequately justified by the Applicant. 
Toxicology 
Relevance of animal models 
The applicant has provided data on JAK inhibitory effects in mice and rats indicating that there is a 
cross-reactivity in these species which could qualify them as relevant toxicological species. However, no 
such data has been presented for dogs and rabbits. The applicant´s justification for this is based on the 
high sequence homology of the JAK family between species, data from other JAK-inhibitors that indicate 
similar inhibitory response between species and that dogs and rabbits has been considered as relevant 
species with these other JAK-inhibitors. It is de facto that cross-reactivity of filgotinib has not been tested 
in these species which is expected before inclusion in toxicology studies. However, this issue was no 
longer pursue by the CHMP. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Filgotinib related adverse effects were observed in male reproductive system including microscopic 
testicular changes and reduced spermatogenesis and fertility. The lesions in testis consisted of germ cell 
depletion/degeneration and/or tubular vacuolation with correlating changes in epididymides (reduced 
sperm content and/or increased cell debris) and was observed in mice, rats and dogs with dogs being 
most sensitive. In dogs, effects were observed already after 4-weeks of administration while in rats, 
effects were seen after 13 weeks. In dogs, adverse testicular effects were observed at AUC exposure 
margins from 0.9-fold of the clinical exposure at 200mg. In fertility studies in rats, reduced male fertility 
(5% fertility) and marked testicular lesions and marked reduced sperm quality and quantity occurred at 
60 mg/kg/day with a NOAEL at 30 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately a 3-fold AUC exposure 
marginal to the clinical daily dose at 200 mg. 
Filgotinib related adverse effects on female fertility was observed at the same dose and included 
increased post implantation loss due to increased early and late resorptions. At LOAEL for male 
reproductive organs generally no changes of hormonal levels or seminology parameters were observed 
apart from increased LH levels in rats. At higher doses (and exposure) a decrease of testosterone, FSH 
and inhibin levels was observed in rats while in dogs no changes of testosterone or FSH levels occurred at 
any dose. Partial reversibility was observed in dogs treated for 13 weeks and 8 weeks of recovery with 
reduced number of sperms and normal sperms without microscopic testicular changes. In a mechanistic 
study in rats, filgotinib did not affect the transcription of genes relevant to the JAK pathway in testis and 
the gene expression observed did not match any profile published or within public database. However, 
other possibilities that is not related to the JAK pathway may exist for example cross reactivity to kinases 
and receptors potentially expressed in testis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 37/170 
 
 
 
Another potential mechanism contributing to impaired spermatogenesis may be related to carnitine, e.g. 
it is possible that the CPCA-carnitine formation may result in a depletion of carnitine. Carnitine, known to 
exert anti-oxidative effects is highly concentrated in epididymis and play a crucial role in sperm 
metabolism and maturation. Positive correlations between seminal concentrations and sperm 
count/motility have been found in clinical studies, and carnitine can function as marker of epididymal 
function. However, carnitine appears not to have been monitored in the preclinical studies and no 
discussion on carnitine impact on male infertility have been provided in the non-clinical dossier. The 
applicant proposed that a secondary effect caused by alteration of carnitine levels may be of minor 
relevance, referring to the low concentration of CPCA in plasma and urine and that no effects on testes 
was observed in a FDA 90-day rat study evaluating CPCA toxicity, but instead may be a direct effect by 
filgotinib which seems reasonable. Furthermore, with the clinical daily dose of 200mg/kg filgotinib the 
daily dietary intake or biosynthesis of carnitine overcome the potential loss further support a minimal risk 
of alteration of carnitine homeostasis causing a potential effect on male reproductive organs. 
Effects on male reproductive system were observed in dogs also with the metabolite GS-829845 after 
13-week treatment at doses ≥ 20 mg/kg/day. However, after longer duration of treatment, no testicular 
findings were observed up to 30 mg/kg/day after 26-week exposure and testicular findings observed at 
15 and 30 mg/kg/d after 39-week exposure were not considered adverse as they corresponded to those 
observed in the control groups. 
In summary, the mechanism behind the testicular toxicity remains unknown. At the CHMP’s request, the 
applicant proposed a stringent warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to mitigate the risk regarding male 
fertility which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. In addition, adequate risk minimisation measures 
have been proposed by the Applicant. This risk is addressed in the educational material with the aim to 
limit the use of filgotinib to female patients and male patients without intent of fathering a child. 
The applicant considers the increased Leydig cell tumours to be related to a rat-specific mechanism 
involving increasing levels of LH that is linked to increase in rat Leydig cells tumours referring to Cook et 
al. 1999  and Chapin 2016 who further states that rat Leydig cells are considerably more sensitive to LH 
than human Leydig cells due to an increased number of LH receptors and an increased sensitivity. In the 
rat repeated toxicity studies filgotinib induced increased levels of LH (at 45 mg/kg daily dose for 39-weeks 
the LH levels increased with a 2-fold and dosing of 180 mg/kg increases were 6-fold compared to control 
animals) and Leydig cell hyperplasia at 60 mg/kg. Considering this it is likely to think that increases of LH 
occurred also in rats after two years of dosing with filgotinib. Based on that LH is a known inducer of 
Leydig cell tumours in rodents and the known major differences between rodent and humans with respect 
to prevalence of different testicular tumour types, hormonal physiology and response and risk factors for 
Leydig cell tumours the CHMP agreed that the observed Leydig cell tumours are of little relevance for 
humans. 
Combinate toxicity of filgotinib and GS-829845 
One pilot 14-day study in rat raised concern about safety of the combination filgotinib/GS-829845, when 
administrated at ratio 1/6. NOAEL was determined based on male reproductive effect and this NOAEL 
determined in rat for the combination (10/60 mg/kg/day) was lower than the NOAEL determined when 
filgotinib and GS-829845 were administrated separately (filgotinib 4-w study: NOAEL > 45 mg/kg/d, 
13-w and 26w-studies: 20 mg/kg/day and GS-829845 no effect on male reproductive system up to 26 
weeks, NOAEL > 180 mg/kg/day). Indeed, the observed testicular findings after combination 
administration were at similar exposure than after administration of filgotinib alone. Co administration of 
filgotinib with its metabolite did not result in exacerbation of testicular toxicity.  
Assessment report

Immunosuppression 
Effects consistent with the inhibition of JAK1/3 (reduced circulating lymphocytes and NK-cells with 
correlating changes in lymphoid tissues) were observed in nearly all dose levels in repeated dose toxicity 
studies of all species assessed after administration of either filgotinib or GS-829845. Adverse, but 
reversible, effects were observed in rats from 20 mg/kg/day (1.6x clinical exposure) and in dogs from 15 
mg/kg/day (6x clinical exposure) after administration with filgotinib. Furthermore, effects consistent with 
JAK-2 inhibition (RBC parameters and reticulocytes) were observed in mice, rats and dogs administrated 
with filgotinib but without obvious effects with GS-829845. In rats, reduced RBC parameters were 
observed at doses from 100 mg/kg/day and in dogs at 5 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for JAK-1 and JAK-2 
related changes were with filgotinib 45 mg/kg/day in rat and 5 and 2.5 mg/kg/day in dogs corresponding 
to 5.9-fold and 1.8- and 1.1-fold, respectively, compared to the AUC clinical exposure at 200mg/kg. 
Carcinogenic potential 
Filgotinib can be considered as not genotoxic or clastogenic. 
Filgotinib (but not GS-829845) induced increased incidence of testis Leydig cell tumours in male rats. This 
is likely a rodent specific finding with little relevance for humans based on that filgotinib (but not 
GS-829845) induce increased levels of LH in rats which is a known inducer of Leydig cell tumours in 
rodents and the known major differences between rodent and humans with respect to prevalence of 
different testicular tumour types, hormonal physiology and response and risk factors for Leydig cell 
tumours. The Applicant concluded that the increase in Leydig cell hyperplasia/adenomas at exposures 
approximately 2.6 times the 200 mg filgotinib dose in the 2-year carcinogenicity study is not considered 
clinically relevant, which seems reasonable to the CHMP. Section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated 
accordingly. 
Developmental toxicity 
Filgotinib and GS-829845 produced embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Increased post 
implantation loss and a decrease number of live foetuses and foetal body weight were observed at high 
filgotinib dose (100mg/kg). Visceral and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred at all doses with filgotinib and 
GS-829845. Dose-related increase in incidence of abnormalities included, among others, vertebrate and 
sternal abnormalities, rudimentary ribs, dilated/convoluted ureter, internal hydrocephaly, and absent or 
small eyes. No NOAEL was established. The AUC exposure at the lowest dose corresponded to 2.4-fold 
(filgotinib) and 1.7-fold (GS-829845) to the clinical exposure at 200 mg. Similar effects were observed in 
rabbits including increased post implantation loss and a decreased number of live fetuses and fetal body 
weight at high doses and visceral and/or skeletal abnormalities at all dose levels. No NOAEL was 
established. The AUC exposure at the lowest dose corresponded to 1.4-fold (filgotinib) and 4.9-fold 
(GS-829845) to the clinical exposure at 200 mg. The applicant has addressed the embryotoxic and 
teratogenic effects of filgotinib and included pregnancy as contraindication in the SmPC. 
In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats no adverse effects occurred at any dose. The AUC 
exposure at the highest dose of filgotinib (15 mg/kg/day) and GS-829845 (30 mg/kg/day) corresponded 
to a 1.2-fold and 0.8-fold marginal, respectively, to the clinical dose at 200 mg/kg/day. It can be 
concluded that this study is not conclusive due to the low exposure of the animals. In the section 5.3 of 
the SmPC it is reflected that F1 offspring have not been sufficiently exposed and that the pre- and 
postnatal development rat study is therefore not conclusive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 39/170 
 
 
 
In conclusion, filgotinib and GS-829845 is teratogenic in rats and rabbits inducing visceral and skeletal 
malformations with no exposure marginals to the clinical dose at 200 mg/day. The applicant has 
addressed this issue and included pregnancy as contraindication in the SmPC. 
Effects on teeth 
Filgotinib related effects on incisor teeth was observed in rats only, including changes in the lower incisor 
tooth enamel, termed striae, at 45 mg/kg/day and slight to marked degeneration/loss/disorganization of 
ameloblast accompanied with malformed enamel at 100 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for these findings was 
set to 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to 2.8-fold of the clinical AUC exposure at 200 mg/kg. No 
corresponding findings were observed in juvenile rats (up to postnatal day 183) dosed up to 20 
mg/kg/day. The applicant argued that these findings are not relevant for humans as rat incisors grow 
throughout their lives and are therefore continuously depositing new enamel while in humans enamel 
formation is complete once secondary dentition is finished, generally, in the late teens. However, a 
potential risk for humans, in terms of adolescent and paediatric patients, cannot be ruled out. The 
applicant has agreed a PIP with EMA (EMEA 001619 PIP04 17 M01) for RA indication in paediatric patients 
and dosing regimen and PK blood sampling will be agreed with PDCO before initiation of treatment to 
minimize potential risks observed in non-clinical studies including effects on incisor teeth, which is 
acknowledged. At the CHMP’s request, the effects on incisor teeth in rats are addressed in the SmPC 
section 5.3. 
Impurities 
The Applicant’s strategy to perform directly in vivo genotoxicity studies on impurities GS 831208 and GS 
830681 is acceptable. Indeed, this strategy based on the provided literature references for in vitro results 
and the PigA and Comet assays selection are justified. Therefore, impurities GS 831208 and GS 830681 
could be considered as ICH M7 Class 5 impurity (non-mutagenic impurity) and controlled as such. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Filgotinib was found to be very persistent in the sediment compartment but is not considered as a PBT or 
vPvB substance. One transformation product U1 is identical with the major metabolite GS-845829 and 
this should be stated within an updated ERA. Based on a complete Phase II assessment it can be 
concluded that no environmental effects are expected following the use of filgotinib. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From the in vitro PD studies, it can be concluded that filgotinib is a JAK family inhibitor with some 
preference for JAK1 or JAK1/JAK3.  In absence of a JAK3 selective cellular assay, the relative contribution 
of JAK3 vs JAK1 inhibitory activity at the cellular level cannot be concluded. There were equivocal findings 
on selective inhibition of JAK1 over JAK2 with whole blood assay showing a >14-fold JAK1 selectivity but 
other cellular assays and biochemical binding showing less convincing results. Overall, the clinical Cmax 
for filgotinib is well above the observed Kd values for all JAK family members, consequently inhibition of 
any of these cannot entirely be ruled out. The main metabolite GS-829845 display 10-fold lower potency 
and contribute to PD effects when administered to CIA rats in similar exposure AUC ratio as observed in 
humans. All metabolites have been adequately exposed in the toxicity studies. 
The toxicological program revealed that filgotinib induced adverse effects on male reproductive system 
and fertility. Despite further investigations, intended to shed light on potential mechanisms for the 
toxicity, no further understanding has been gained. Thus, the clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. However, it seems clear that the toxicity is caused by filgotinib, and not by GS 829845, the 
major metabolite of filgotinib. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant proposed a stringent warning in 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 40/170 
 
 
 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to mitigate the risk regarding male fertility which was considered acceptable to 
the CHMP. In addition, adequate risk minimisation measures have been proposed by the Applicant. This 
risk is addressed in the educational material with the aim to limit the use of filgotinib to female patients 
and male patients without intent of fathering a child. Finally, the data from the ongoing clinical MANTA 
study evaluating the impact on male fertility is expected to provide an understanding as to whether the 
findings are clinically relevant (see RMP – Section 2.7. ). 
Furthermore, the toxicology program revealed that filgotinib and the human metabolite GS-829845 have 
embryotoxic and teratogenic potential at low exposures compared to that of the intended clinical dose. 
Therefore, filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. 
There were no concerns of human relevance regarding carcinogenic potential. Filgotinib or GS-829845 is 
not considered mutagenic, clastogenic or phototoxic. 
In summary, the application is acceptable from a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The systemic plasma concentration of the major metabolite GS-829845 was ca 15-fold compared to the 
exposure of filgotinib following oral administration of recommended doses. The in vitro activity of 
GS-829845 is about 1/10 of the activity of filgotinib. 
The objectives of the population PK analysis were to determine the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
on the PK of filgotinib and GS-829845 to better understand clinical factors that might affect exposure in 
individual subjects, and to provide model predicted individual subject PK parameter estimates from PopPK 
models for exposure-response analysis. Separate models were developed for filgotinib and its metabolite 
GS-829845. 
As both filgotinib and its metabolite GS-829845 contribute to efficacy, their exposures (active moiety) 
were combined into a single parameter, AUCeff. The exposure-safety analyses were performed 
separately for filgotinib and GS-829845 to characterize the individual safety profiles of each analyte. 
Bioanalysis 
Plasma concentrations of filgotinib and GS-829845 (major metabolite) have been determined 
simultaneously by using LC-MS/MS methods following validations/partially validations. The method was 
further developed during the development and transferred to different contract research organisations 
(CROs). In the final method, filgotinib-d4 and GS-829845-d4 were used as internal standards. The 
calibration range was set to 1-2000 ng/ml for filgotinib and 2-4000 ng/ml for GS-829845. Within study 
validations have been performed. 
Filgotinib and GS-829845 concentrations in the urine were determined simultaneously by LC-MS/MS 
using either filgotinib-d4 or filgotinib-d5 as internal standard. The calibration range was 1-1000 ng/ml for 
both filgotinib and GS-829845. The assay was transferred to different CROs and appropriately validated. 
An LC-MS/MS method was used and qualified for determination of CPCA (cyclopropane carboxylic acid) 
and conjugates in plasma and urine. CPCA-d5 was used as internal standard and the calibration range was 
5-5000 ng/ml and 10-5000 ng/ml for CPCA in plasma and urine, respectively. Assays for determination of 
CPCA-conjugates (CPCA-carnitine, glycine and taurine) were qualified using CPCA-carnitine-d5, 
CPCA-glycine-d5, and CPCA-taurine-d5 were used as internal standards. 
Following co-administration of midazolam, oral contraceptive, metformin and methotrexate, plasma 
concentrations of midazolam, 1-OH-midazolam and 4-OH-midazolam, norgestrel, norgestimate, ethinyl 
estradiol, metformin, methotrexate and 7-OH-methotrexate appropriately determined using available 
methods at CROs. 
Absorption  
Filgotinib is characterized as a BCS-II compound i.e. high permeability, low solubility. Both filgotinib and 
GS-829845 are characterized as Pgp substrate in vitro. 
Filgotinib was rapidly absorbed, with a tmax dependent on formulation 0.5-1h and 1-3h following 
administration a solution and a capsule, respectively. Tmax was determined to 1-3 h following 
administration of filgotinib 200 mg. 
Steady state was reached on Day 2 and Day 4 for filgotinib and GS-829845 following repeated dosing. The 
RAC (accumulation ratio) was 1.1 for filgotinib and 2.2 for GS-829845 after filgotinib 200 mg od. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 44/170 
 
 
 
 
A fairly dose-proportionality in the PK was seen at doses <100 mg but a more than dose-proportional 
increase at doses of ≥100 mg (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: AUC versus oral doses of filgotinib  
More than 85% of the dose was absorbed, as 87% of a 14C-filgotinib-dose was excreted in the urine . 
No clinically relevant difference in systemic exposure was seen following filgotinib 200 mg without and 
with food (high fat meal). Cmax and AUCinf of filgotinib was 0.8-fold and 1-fold, respectively, and for 
GS-829845 0.9-fold and 1.0-fold when given together with food compared to without. 
Formulation development continued during the whole development program of filgotinib. Different 
formulations have been used in the clinical pharmacology program - oral solution, capsule and “early” 
tablet except in the drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with transporter proteins where the “new” tablet 
was used. The “new” tablet was further developed during phase 3, where only the composition of the 
tablet was modified qualitatively but not quantitatively. 
• 
• 
The capsule (filgotinib-HCl) was not bioequivalent (BE) to the “early” tablet (filgotinib-HCl) after 
filgotinib 200 mg – fasted state tablet/capsule ratio of Cmax 1.04 (90%CI 0.80-1.35) and AUCinf 
1.16 (90%CI 0.99-1.36). No difference in GS-829845 between the two formulations. 
The “new” (commercial; filgotinib-maleate) tablet 200 mg was BE to the early tablet 100 mgx2 – 
“new”/early tablet ratio of Cmax 1.01 (90%CI 0.87-1.18) and AUCinf 0.97 (90%CI 0.91-1.04). No 
difference in GS-829845 between the two formulations. 
Distribution 
The fu (unbound fraction) of filgotinib 4 µg/ml and GS-829845 20 µg/ml were determined to 0.45 and 
0.66, respectively. 
Similar fu of filgotinib was seen in plasma from patients with moderate hepatic impairment (HI) 0.44 
compared to 0.41 in plasma from healthy subjects. For GS-829845 fu was 0.61 in moderate HI and 0.55 
in subjects with normal hepatic function. 
The in vitro CB/CP ratio (at 0.5 µM) was determined to 1 and 1.4 for filgotinib and GS-829845, 
respectively. 
Filgotinib and GS-829845 are substrates of the glycoprotein P (P-gp) transporter.

Elimination 
The terminal t1/2 (half-life) of filgotinib was calculated to approximately 7h and the t1/2 for the major 
metabolite GS-829845 was 19-27h. 
The excretion of 14C-filgotinib 100 mg (6.1 MBq) was studied in healthy subjects (n=6) following a single, 
oral dose in fed state. Eighty-seven percent (87%; range 80-94%) of the administered dose 
(14C-filgotinib) was excreted in the urine and 15% (range 11-22%) in faeces.  
The excretion was rapid with approximately half of the radioactivity excreted within the first 24-h period 
after administration.  
About 9% and 4% of the 14C-filgotinib dose was excreted as parent compound in the urine and faeces, 
respectively. 
Metabolism 
The main elimination pathway for filgotinib is via hydrolysis of the amide bond to GS-829845 and CPCA 
(cyclopropane carboxylic acid). In vitro metabolic identification suggested that filgotinib was mainly 
metabolized by CES2 (carboxylesterase 2) but also to a minor degree by CES1b and CES1c. Expression 
data from intestinal and liver S9 samples suggests that CES2 is expected to be the predominant enzyme 
overall, and that CES1 will play a larger role in hepatic metabolism of filgotinib versus intestinal 
metabolism. 
One major metabolite was identified, following a single dose 14C-filgotinib 100 mg, with 54% and 9% of 
the dose excreted as GS-829845 in urine and faces, respectively. Even more was metabolized via that 
way as 15% and 2% of the dose were identified as GS-829845-N-glucuronide in the urine and faeces, 
respectively. Thus 80% of the dose is eliminated via the GS-829845 metabolic pathway. 
Six further metabolites were observed in the urine and faeces and each of them was excreted as<2% of 
the dose in faeces and urine, respectively. 
The systemic exposure of the main plasma metabolite GS-829845, CPCA-carnitine and CPCA-glycine was 
15-, 7- and 0.4-fold of the exposure of filgotinib, respectively. 
Filgotinib=GLPG0634; GS829845=G254445

metabolites following a single oral dose of 14C-filgotinib 100 mg (6.1 MBq) 
Plasma concentration vs time profiles of total radioactivity, filgotinib and detected plasma 
The basic PK of GS-829845 has been determined after both single doses and at steady state. The t1/2, 
19-27h, was comparable with the t1/2 of total plasma radioactivity. The RAC was 1.8-2.2-fold at once daily 
dosing. 
The t1/2 of CPCA-carnitine was calculated to 49h following a single dose 14C-filgotinib 100 mg.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Since the population PK analysis was deemed inadequate, data from a DDI study with the commercial 
formulation (study GS-US-417-4107) and phase 3 data were used to describe variability, see Table 7.  
Table 7 PK parameters and their variability with the commercial formulation and in phase 3 studies 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The population PK analysis of filgotinib and GS-829845 included data from 7 Phase 1 clinical studies in 
healthy subjects, 4 Phase 2 clinical studies in subjects with RA and 3 Phase 3 clinical studies in subjects 
with RA.  
The final model of Filgotinib 
The final filgotinib model was described by a 2-compartment model, with a mixture model for absorption 
and linear elimination. 
The η-shrinkage for apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume Vc/F, ka and D1 was 25%, 
52%, 45% and 51%, respectively, and the ε-shrinkage was 12%. The final model parameter estimates 
are presented in Table 8. 
Capsules and tablets were found to have different relative bioavailability(F) with capsules showing a 34% 
lower F. Weight effects were included on CL/F, apparent intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), Vc/F and 
apparent peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F) using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 for the 
clearance (CL) and 1 for the volume of distribution (V) parameters. Moreover, baseline C-reactive protein 
(bCRP) and sex female (SEXF) were identified as statistically significant covariates on filgotinib CL/F, 
whereas race (white and Asian versus black or African American versus  other) were identified as a 
statistically significant covariate on Vc/F. Covariates were also examined to explain the mixture 
absorption model, but none of the available covariates could explain the difference in the absorption 
profiles observed.

Special population 
Dose adjustments in general are based on the AUCeff, which is the AUC for the active moiety as the sum 
for the AUC of filgotinib and its active metabolite GS 829845, corrected for molecular weight and potency 
according to the following equation: AUCeff = AUCFIL + AUCmet * 1/10 * (425.51/357.43) 
A threshold of 200% increase in AUCeff is considered for dose adjustments (Table 10).

Impaired renal function (RI) 
In an open, 2-part, 5-parallel-group design, subjects with varying degree of renal function received 
filgotinib 100 mg od for 10 days. Renal function was characterized using estimated using glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) by using the MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease) equation initially, before 
results based on absolute GFR were provided. Partly a reduced study design was applied, starting with 
investigations in severe RI (renal impairment) and then depending on the results mild and moderate RI 
were to be recruited 
When using absolute GFR, comparable exposure of filgotinib was seen in mild RI and in subjects with 
normal renal function. The exposure of filgotinib was about 1.6 and 2.2-fold in moderate and severe RI 
compared in healthy subjects, respectively. The exposure of GS-829845 increased more than parent 
compound with decreasing degree of renal function, with a total exposure of about 1.4-fold in mild RI 
compared to normal and ca 3.5-fold in severe RI. 
The AUCeff, which is determining for dose adjustments, was increased by 1.96-fold in patients with 
moderate renal impairment (Table 10). 
Impaired hepatic function (HI) 
Male and female subjects (n=48) diagnosed with different degrees of HI were included in an open, single 
dose study. Subjects were planned to be included in three cohorts, starting with cohort 1 (moderate HI). 
Adaptive cohorts 2 (severe HI) and 3 (mild HI) were to be enrolled as determined by review of preliminary 
data from cohort 1 to decide whether further evaluation in subjects with mild or severe HI was needed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 53/170 
 
 
 
The exposure of filgotinib was about 1.6-fold and GS-829845 ca 1.2-fold in moderate HI compared to in 
healthy subjects. The metabolite/parent compound ratio was slightly less in HI compared to in healthy 
17- and 22-fold, respectively. The t1/2 was slightly increased in moderate HI 7.4 h compared to 5.5 h in 
healthy subjects. 
Gender, Race, Age and Weight  
All clinical studies were conducted in adult (≥18 years of age) patients or healthy volunteers. 
Following filgotinib 200 mg once daily(od) for 10 days, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, study design, 
the PK of filgotinib and GS-829845 were investigated in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects (n=20). 
The PK of parent compound and major metabolite were in general comparable between the two groups 
with comparable AUCτ, Cmax and renal excretion of unchanged compound but with a slightly longer t1/2 
of filgotinib in Caucasians than in Japanese 11h and 7h. 
There was a tendency to increasing exposure of both filgotinib and GS-829845 with age following 
filgotinib 100 mg od. The AUC0-24h was about 1.4-fold in subjects ≥75 years compared to in 40-50 years 
subjects. The t1/2 was ca 6h independently of age. CLR (renal clearance) of both filgotinib and 
GS-829845 decreased with age. 
There is a trend between the AUC of filgotinib and weight (majority of subjects weighed between 60-100 
kg). However, the trend is not considered to be clinically relevant. There does not appear to be a clear 
trend between AUC of GS-829845 and weight. The relationship should be re-evaluated for both 
compounds if patients weighing less are included.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Filgotinib is an ATP-competitive and reversible inhibitor of the JAK family. There are currently three 
approved JAK-inhibitors and the knowledge on the effects and side effects are becoming increasingly 
known. Please refer to the non-clinical assessment for further characterisation of the MoA for filgotinib 
(Section 2.3. ).

Relationship between plasma concentration and response 
Data 
Estimated filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures were derived using the population PK model. 
As both filgotinib and its metabolite, GS-829845, contribute to efficacy, their exposures were combined 
into a single parameter, AUCeff. AUCeff was defined as the weighted sum of steady-state AUC0-24 values

of filgotinib and GS-829845 based on a relative 10-fold potency on JAK1 inhibition for filgotinib over the 
metabolite and molecular weight. 
The exposure-response analyses for safety were based on the pooled population in Phase 2/3 studies and 
were performed separately for filgotinib and GS-829845 to characterize the individual safety profiles of 
each analyte. 
Results 
Graphical analysis of exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety was conducted. 
Exposure-efficacy analysis (American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses stratified by octiles of 
AUCeff in subjects with RA) across the Phase 3 program confirmed that filgotinib produced robust 
therapeutic effects across the exposure range observed at both 200 mg and 100 mg once daily  
(See Figure 6).

once daily in Phase 3 subjects with RA. AUCeff is based on the population PK-predicted exposure in Phase 
3 subjects with RA receiving filgotinib.  
Exposure-safety analysis by serious adverse events (SAEs) and serious infections was generated. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIR) of SAEs and serious infections based on safety data up to 
52 weeks are stratified by octiles of AUC0-24 (x-axis). The analysis included population PK-based 
exposure estimated AUC0-24, with the upper 4 octiles approximately corresponding to a 200 mg 
once-daily dose and the lower 4 octiles associated with a 100 mg once-daily dose. 
In the analysis, subjects with higher PK exposures (upper 4 octiles) showed similar and overlapping EAIR 
of SAEs compared with subjects with lower PK exposures (lower 4 octiles) for both filgotinib and 
GS-829845. Similarly, EAIR of serious infections highly overlapped regardless of the higher or lower PK 
exposures. Thus, no exposure-driven trends are present, indicating a lack of association between 
filgotinib or GS-829845 exposures and SAEs or serious infections. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Filgotinib is a small molecule with no chiral centre and is very insoluble at physiological pH (BSC2). The 
major elimination pathway is metabolism to one major metabolite GS-829845, the systemic plasma 
concentration of GS 829845 was ca 15-fold compared to the exposure of filgotinib following oral 
administration with recommended doses. The in vitro activity of GS-829845 is about 1/10 of the activity 
of filgotinib, thus active moiety should be considered when risks with interactions or decreased organ 
function are discussed.  
Bioanalytical assays using LC-MS/MS for determination of filgotinib and the major metabolite GS 829845 
in plasma as well as in the urine have been developed. The assays have been appropriately 
validated/qualified for their intended purpose.  
Formulation development has been ongoing during the whole development also during the late phase, the 
initial phase-3-formulation was modified/adjusted. Relative bioavailability studies have shown that the 
capsule (filgotinib-HCl) used in the program cannot be claimed BE to the “early tablet”/phase-1 tablet 
(filgotinib-HCl). The “early tablet” 100 mg*2 is BE to the “new tablet” (filgotinib maleate) 200 mg. The 
“new tablet” and the commercial tablet differ only in their qualitative composition, which is not expected 
to have an impact on PK. Thereby, the lack of an additional BE study for the commercial tablet is 
acceptable to CHMP.  
The unbound fraction (fu) of both filgotinib and GS-829845 are important to know in the evaluation of 
systemic exposure in different situations as eg organ impairment. One-point estimations of fu at 
non-clinically relevant concentrations have been reported and further in vitro data were requested. The 
Applicant referred to in vivo protein binding data to justify the lack of further in vitro testing, which was 
deemed acceptable to CHMP.  
High exposure of GS-829845 was seen after both single and repeated dosing. In the SAD/MAD study the 
exposure of GS-829845 at steady state was about 20-fold compared to filgotinib but decreased with dose 
from 24- to 18-fold at doses from 25 to 100 mg bid. The exposure ratio between main metabolite and 
parent compound was 16-fold after 200 mg od. A fairly dose-proportional increase in exposure was seen 
at doses <100 mg but a more than dose-proportional increase at doses of ≥100 mg. The Applicant 
presented data showing that both filgotinib and GS-829845 exhibit time-independent PK. 
Filgotinib can be administered with or without food. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 58/170 
 
 
 
The major elimination pathway for filgotinib is via metabolism to GS-829845, with ca 80% of the dose 
excreted as GS-829845 or further conjugation. The overall in vitro metabolic turnover in hepatocytes was 
low but GS-829845 was formed during in vitro incubations with recombinant CES (carboxylesterases). 
The presented data demonstrates that filgotinib is primarily a substrate of CES2 and that CES1 has a 
minor involvement in the metabolism of filgotinib. Polymorphism of CES was likely to have a minimal 
impact on the PK of filgotinib, which is acceptable. There is however a difference between the inhibition of 
filgotinib metabolism by the pan inhibitor of amidases and esterases BNPP, as compared to the inhibition 
by the CES2 inhibitor only. Other amidases than CES2, CES1b and CES1c were however not studied in this 
system. It can currently not be concluded whether it is truly only CES1 and CES2 that are responsible for 
the metabolism of filgotinib to GS-829845, or whether other enzymes, also inhibited by the pan inhibitor 
of amidases and esterases BNPP, may be involved. As the Applicant noted, no clinical inhibitors of other 
amide hydrolases are reported; therefore, the issue was not further pursued by CHMP. 
The Applicant discussed the clinical relevance of CES inhibition, noting that it is unclear whether 
loperamide concentrations high enough to inhibit CES2 may occur in vivo. While the applicants concern 
regarding the clinical relevance of the interaction with loperamide is acknowledged, this elimination 
pathway is responsible for 80% of the elimination of filgotinib, which may result in significant increased 
exposure if this pathway was inhibited. There are however other examples of stronger CES2 inhibitors in 
the literature, even if they have only been studied in vitro. As this uncertainty remains, the CHMP 
requested the MAH to include a warning for co-administration with CES2 inhibitors in section 4.5 of the 
SmPC. Given the lower involvement of CES1, the CHMP agreed that no warning is required for CES1 
inhibitors. 
The Applicant clarified that dose adjustments are proposed based on the active moiety exposure (AUCeff) 
and not solely on the exposure of filgotinib. AUCeff is the sum of AUCs (as calculated by NCA) of filgotinib 
and GS 829845, corrected for their molecular weight and for the potency of GS 829845 (1/10). AUCeff is 
not corrected for the respective protein binding of filgotinib and GS 829845, which is acceptable, since 
these are in the same range. The proposed approach is endorsed by the CHMP. The defined threshold for 
a dose adjustment (200%) required further discussion, as adequate safety data was not provided for 
moderate renal impairment, where a 196% increase of AUCeff is observed and a dose adjustment in this 
population was included upon CHMP request in the SmPC. 
Instead of performing a new in vitro experiment on P-gp and BCRP inhibition by GS-829845 as requested 
by the CHMP, the Applicant recalculated the inhibitory effect of GS-829845 using different equations from 
the literature. There are however still uncertainties remaining regarding the initial experiment where 
inconsistent patterns are seen over the studied concentration range rendering the experiment unreliable, 
and the maximal studied concentration was far below the cutoff. As a consequence, the Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC was updated by the Applicant to state that “in vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential 
of the primary metabolite of filgotinib GS 82984 to inhibit P-gp or BRCP. In vivo inhibition of these 
transporters cannot be excluded, and caution is recommended when substrates with a narrow therapeutic 
index (e.g. digoxin) are co-administered with filgotinib”. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has 
committed to perform a new in vitro study of the inhibition of P-gP and BCR by GS-829845, with 
concentrations at least up to 50xCmax,u=274 µM by December 2020. If the outcome of the study is 
negative, the SmPC may be updated. Should the study result in inconclusive data, a second in vitro 
system should be considered. 
The mechanistic static model was used by the Applicant to verify the in vitro signals on CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 inhibition by GS 829845, with Ki determined from two experiments. The resulting AUR is below 
the guideline cut-off. Thus GS-829845 is not likely a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYP2C9 or CYP2C19.  
The inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 has not been verified in vivo instead the Applicant has developed 
and used a preliminary physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model (SimCYP v.18, Certara UK) 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 59/170 
 
 
 
to predict the potential for filgotinib and GS-829845 to inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. A qualification of 
the PBPK platform for the intended purpose has been presented, however key elements to qualify the 
model are missing. Therefore, the applicant was requested to include a warning for co-administration with 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates in section 4.5 of the SmPC. The applicant has also committed to the 
post authorisation measure to perform a clinical DDI study to investigate OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
inhibition by filgotinib and GS-829845 with the proposed timeline for the submission of new clinical DDI 
data by September 2022. 
From a mechanistic point of view there appears to be a limited potential for interactions between 
filgotinib, GS-829845 and most of the different cDMARDs. However, there are still some uncertainties 
regarding both filgotinib and GS-829845 as perpetrators. With the updated indication (see Section 2.5), 
only methotrexate is to be used in combination with filgotinib. Regarding methotrexate all data; 
mechanistic discussion, in vitro as well as in vivo data, point to no potential interaction between filgotinib 
and methotrexate. Hence, a new dedicated in vivo DDI study between methotrexate and filgotinib was 
not considered warranted by the CHMP. 
There was no effect of filgotinib on the PK of the combined contraceptive ethinyl estradiol and 
levonorgestrel when co administered with filgotinib; thus no dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is 
required. In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding filgotinib’s potential to induce CYP2B6 or CYP1A2. 
However, in vivo induction cannot be excluded. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Bodyweight, gender, race, and age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics (AUC 
and Cmax) of filgotinib or GS 829845. 
No clinically relevant changes in the exposures (AUC) of filgotinib and GS 829845 individually, or their 
combined exposure (AUCeff), were observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh 
B). Hence, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh A or B).  
Filgotinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) and is therefore 
not recommended for use in these patients. 
The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and GS 829845 were unaffected in subjects with mild renal impairment 
(CrCl 60 to < 90 mL/min). Hence, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 60 mL/min).   
Increases in exposures (AUC) of filgotinib, GS 829845, and combined AUCeff (≤ 2 fold), were observed in 
subjects with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to < 60 mL/min). In subjects with severe renal 
impairment (CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min), filgotinib exposure (AUC) increased by 2.2 fold and GS 829845 
exposure significantly increased by 3.5 fold leading to a 3 fold increase in AUCeff. Hence, a dose of 100 
mg of filgotinib once daily is recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 
15 to < 60 mL/min). 
The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib has not been studied in subjects with end stage renal disease (CrCl < 
15 mL/min); hence, filgotinib is not recommended for use in these patients. 
See also safety section 2.6. 
The Applicant conducted population PK analysis with the objectives to characterize the PK of filgotinib and 
GS-829845, determine the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK of filgotinib and GS-829845 
to better understand clinical factors that might affect exposure in individual subjects, and to provide 
model predicted individual subject PK parameter estimates from PopPK models for exposure-response 
analysis. There are identified issues in all aspects concerning the model, i.e. the handling of data, the 
structural and statistical model, and the covariate analysis. The popPK analysis is considered inadequate 
and no conclusion can be made based on this analysis with regard to demographic factors. The model 
Assessment report

cannot adequately capture phase 1 data, not Cmax of phase 2 or phase 3 data. Trends are observed in the 
goodness-of-fit plots. The filgotinib and GS-829845 models are considered inadequate and should not be 
used for determining the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK of filgotinib and GS-829845, or 
for predictions or simulations. The models can estimate the observed phase 2 and phase 3 AUC for 
filgotinib and GS-829845 sufficiently in this application for investigation of possible trends between AUC 
and efficacy and safety. 
Pharmacodynamics 
As both filgotinib and its metabolite , GS-829845, contribute to efficacy, their exposures were combined 
into a single parameter, AUCeff. The exposure-response analyses for safety were based on the pooled 
population in Phase 2/3 studies and were performed separately for filgotinib and GS-829845 to 
characterize the individual safety profiles of each analyte. This approach (combining concentration for 
efficacy assessment) is acceptable to the CHMP. The population PK model was used to predict individual 
exposures of filgotinib and GS-829845, which were then used in the evaluation of the relationships 
(exposure-response). With regard to AUCeff versus ACR20/50/70 it appears that the patients have 
reached an effect plateau with the 200 mg dose.  There does not seem to be an association between 
filgotinib or GS 829845 AUC and SAEs or serious infections. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of filgotinib have been adequately described. Polypharmacy is expected in the target population 
and some additional DDI data will have to be provided as post-approval measure to predict potential PK 
interactions in the clinical setting. 
A starting dose of 100 mg once daily is recommended for patients aged 75 years and older as clinical 
experience is limited. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 60 
mL/min). A dose of 100 mg of filgotinib once daily is recommended for patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment (CrCl 15 to < 60 mL/min). Filgotinib has not been studied in patients with end stage 
renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min) and is therefore not recommended for use in these patients. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or B). 
Filgotinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) and is therefore 
not recommended for use in these patients. 
The population PK model is considered inadequate for assessment of impact of intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors and simulation. The models can estimate the observed phase 2 and phase 3 AUC for filgotinib and 
GS-829845 sufficiently in this application for investigation of possible trends between AUC and efficacy 
and safety. 
Overall, the application is acceptable from a clinical pharmacology perspective. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
General features of submitted data and sought indication 
The efficacy of filgotinib were evaluated in 5 Phase 2 studies in an MTX-IR population (Studies 
GLPG0634-CL-201, GLPG0634-CL-202, GLPG0634-CL-203, GLPG0634-CL-204, and the long-term 
extension study GLPG0634-CL-205 [DARWIN 3]) and Phase 3 studies in a MTX-IR population (Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020

GS-US-417-0301), in a bDMARD-IR population (Study GS-US-417-0302), in an MTX-naive population 
(Study GS-US-417-0303), and a long-term extension (LTE) study (Study GS-US-417-0304 [FINCH 4]), 
see Table 12.  
The duration of FINCH 2 was 24 weeks while the other two-phase III studies were of 52 weeks duration. 
In the initial submission, only data up to 24 weeks were included (in 24 week-CSRs). As a response to the 
Day 120 list of question (LoQ0, the final CSRs with week 52-data were provided. 
For the three Phase 3 RCT, the primary analysis consisted of a superiority test of filgotinib based on the 
ACR20 response rate (at week 12 in FINCH 1,2 and at week 24 in FINCH 3) with an NRI-approach. 
There was one additional Phase 2 study in subjects with RA (Study GS-US-379-1582) that included a 
cohort of 21 subjects who received filgotinib 200 mg for 12 weeks (considered as an exploratory group in 
the study). According to the Applicant, study GS-US-379-1582 was an exploratory study conducted in 
parallel to Phase 3; therefore, it was not used to support dose selection (although an effect of filgotinib vs 
placebo was noted).

The indication initially proposed by the Applicant encompasses monotherapy and combination with MTX ≥ 
second line. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Design and conduct of phase II studies 
Two completed 4-week Phase 2a studies; GLPG0634-CL-201 and GLPG0634-CL-202, explored once or 
twice daily filgotinib doses, on top of MTX, up to a total daily dose of 200 mg or 300 mg, respectively. 
Doses above 200 mg daily were not pursued in Phase 2b because an exposure-response analysis was 
considered to demonstrate that responses were at plateau with the 200-mg daily dose.  
The phase 2b studies GLPG0634-CL-203; DARWIN 1 and GLPG0634-CL-204; DARWIN 2 included 
subjects exposed at 3 different daily doses of GLPG0634 i.e. filgotinib (i.e. 50, 100, and 200 mg daily) at 
2 dose regimens (once and twice daily administration). Both studies - the first MTX-add on, the second 
monotherapy - were to be conducted in the second line, MTX-IR population and were randomized, 
double-blind and placebo-controlled, with ACR 20 at week 12 being the primary endpoint and an 
NRI-approach. Regarding DARWIN 2, it is noted that although this was considered as a monotherapy 
study, antimalarial DMARDs were included among the permitted medications. 
Data from the phase II studies 
In GLPG0634-CL-201, 36 MTX-IRs subjects were randomized. At Week 4, the number and percentage of 
ACR20 responders (the primary efficacy endpoint) was 4 (33.3%), 9 (75.0%), and 11 (91.7%) in the 
placebo, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 and the Filgotinib 100 mgx2 groups, respectively. 
In GLPG0634-CL-202, 91 MTX-IRs subjects were randomized and received study treatment. At Week 4, 
the percentage of subjects achieving ACR20 response (the primary endpoint) in the placebo group was 
41.2% and in the Filgotinib 30 mg/day, Filgotinib 75 mg/day, Filgotinib 150 mg/day and Filgotinib 300 
mg/day groups: 35.3%, 54.5%, 40.0%, and 65.0%, respectively. 
In GLPG0634CL203; DARWIN 1, 594 subjects were randomized and treated. The outcome of the primary 
endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 12, was: 44.2% in the placebo group,  56.1% in 50 mgx1 group, 
63.5% in the 100 mgx1 group, 68.6% in the 200 mgx1, 57.0% in the 25 mgx1 group, 60.0% in the 50 
mgx2, 78.6% in the 100 mgx2 group (p-values<0.05 for the comparison vs placebo for the 100 mgx1, 
200 mgx1 and 100 mgx2 groups). Dose-dependent responses were observed in the majority of these 
secondary efficacy parameters including proportion of subjects achieving remission/Low Disease Activity 
(LDA).  
In GLPG0634-CL-204; DARWIN 2, 283 subjects were randomized and treated. The outcome of the 
primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 12, was: 29.2% in the placebo group, 66.7% in the 50 mgx1 
group, 65.7% in the 100 mgx1 group and 72.5% in the 200 mgx1 group (p<0.0001 for all comparisons 
vs placebo). The outcome for the secondary endpoint Disease Activity Score 28 C-reactive protein 
(DAS28 [CRP]) remission or LDA at Weeks 12 (NRI [ITT Population]) was as follows at week 12: 13.9% 
in the placebo group, 23.6% in the 50 mgx1 group, 27.1% in the 100 mgx1 group and 44.9% in the 200 
mgx1 group (p-value<0.05 for the comparison of the 200 mg group vs placebo). At week 24 the 
proportion with DAS28 (CRP) remission or LDA was 34.7% in the 50 mgx1 group, 50.0% in the 100 mgx1 
group and 42.0% in the 200 mgx1 group.

Following the phase II studies, the Applicant had initially selected only the 200 mgx1 dose to be tested in 
the phase 3 programme. As this was questioned by the SAWP/CHMP, both the 100 mg once daily and 200 
mg once daily-doses were then ultimately chosen for the phase 3 studies.  
From the week 156- interim CSR of GLPG0634-CL-205; DARWIN 3, the long term follow-up that included 
subjects that received filgotinib monotherapy (n = 242, rolled over from parent study DARWIN 2) or 
filgotinib with MTX (n = 497, rolled over from parent study DARWIN 1), there are indications that the 
treatment effect of filgotinib (as monotherapy or in combination with MTX) is maintained for up to 3 years 
in patients. It is noted that 229/491 MTX-IR subjects in the MTX + Filgotinib group had low disease 
activity at baseline and 200/290 subjects had low disease activity at week 156. For the monotherapy 
group, the numbers were 97/234 and 88/136. The majority of subjects were on 200 mg Filgotinib/day. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
FINCH 1 (GS-US-417-0301): A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-controlled, Multicenter, 
Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Filgotinib Administered for 52 weeks in Combination 
with Methotrexate to Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Have an 
Inadequate Response to Methotrexate 
Methods 
Study Participants and Treatments 
FINCH 1 is a placebo and active-controlled MTX-add on study that included a second line population 
(active RA despite MTX-treatment) with poor prognostic factors that were randomized to either Filgotinib 
100 mgx1, Filgotinib 200 mgx1, the TNF-inhibitor adalimumab or placebo, with a rescue-possibility to 
standard of care (SOC) at week 14 (in case at least 20% improvement from baseline in swollen joint 
count=SJC and tender joint count=TJC had not been achieved). In addition to MTX, concomitant 
anti-malarial csDMARDs were allowed but no other csDMARDs.  
At Week 24, all subjects assigned to placebo were reassigned to either filgotinib 100 mg once daily or 200 
mg once daily in a blinded fashion and continued in the study through Week 52. All subjects who 
continued on study drug were evaluated for loss of therapeutic response from Week 30 through Week 52. 
Subjects failing to maintain at least a 20% improvement from baseline in TJC and SJC discontinued from 
investigational study drugs but continued in the study. All subjects meeting this criterion are to receive 
standard of care RA treatment are not eligible for enrolment in the separate LTE -study; FINCH 4. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To evaluate the effects of filgotinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA as 
measured by the proportion of subjects achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% 
improvement response (ACR20) at Week 12 (superiority hypothesis). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 12. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 64/170 
 
 
 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints (according to protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) 2) were: 
The proportion of subjects who achieve DAS28 (CRP)≤3.2 (=LDA) at Week 12, Change from Baseline in 
the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score at Week 12, The proportion of 
subjects who achieve DAS28 (CRP)<2.6(=remission) at Week 24, Change from Baseline in modified total 
Sharp scores (mTSS) at Week 24. 
Primary and key secondary endpoints were also measured at time points up to Week 24. Additional 
endpoints measured over time included ACR50/70 response rates and changes in individual ACR 
components, other composite measures of disease activity, EULAR response criteria, Clinical Disease 
Activity Index (CDAI), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and additional patient-reported 
outcomes. 
Statistical methods, randomisation and blinding 
Overall, 1650 subjects were planned to be randomised in a 3:3:2:3 ratio to receive filgotinib 200 mg 
(450), filgotinib 100 mg (450), adalimumab (300), or placebo (450) using an Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS). Randomisation was stratified by geographic region (group A to E), prior exposure to 
bDMARD (Yes or No), and presence of RF or anti-CCP Ab at screening (Yes or No). Masking was to be 
achieved by the use of filgotinib and adalimumab matching placebos and double-dummy technique. The 
sample size was driven by the key secondary endpoint, change from baseline in mTSS at Week 24 which 
implied a high power for the analysis of the primary endpoint (>90%). The sample size estimation also 
considered the non-inferiority comparison with adalimumab aiming at demonstrating that filgotinib 200 
mg preserves more than 50% of the effect of adalimumab with respect to the response rate of 
DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12. 
The geographic regions in FINCH 1 was: 
•  Group A: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, 
Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, and USA 
•  Group B: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, India, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Ukraine, 
Serbia, Hungary, and Poland 
•  Group C: Argentina and Mexico 
•  Group D: Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Thailand 
•  Group E: Japan 
A planned Week 24 analysis was conducted after all subjects had either completed their Week 24 visit or 
prematurely discontinued from the study. A prespecified sponsor team, including members who were not 
actively involved in the conduct of the study after unblinding, reviewed the Week 24 unblinded efficacy 
analysis results and the safety results up to the data-cut of 08 October 2018. 
Statistical methods were described in two SAPs based on differences in feedback from regional health 
authorities. SAP 2 was based on the analysis hierarchy specified in the protocol consistent with CHMP 
Scientific Advice. SAP 2 (version 1.0 (EMA)) was dated 05 February 2019 and was finalised before the 
unblinding of Week 24 analysis.  
Two estimands were defined; a composite estimand and a treatment-policy estimand with the former 
considered primary. Intercurrent events where defined as intake of SOC medications due to inadequate 
response, study treatment discontinuation and study discontinuation. For the primary composite 
estimand the occurrence of an intercurrent event was taken to be a component of the variable, implying 
e.g. that an ACR20 responder besides a successful clinical outcome was required not to have discontinued 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 65/170 
 
 
 
randomised treatment or needing rescue/SOC. With the two estimand strategies analyses were based on 
two data sets; in primary analyses the data set comprised only data collected while the subject was on 
randomised treatment ignoring any data collected after the occurrence of an intercurrent event. For 
secondary analyses, the data set comprised all available data i.e. also measurements observed after a 
subject had discontinued randomised treatment but stayed in the study on SOC (instead ignoring the 
occurrence of an intercurrent event). Analyses using both approaches were planned and have been 
performed for the primary as well as key secondary endpoints.  
For categorical endpoints, including the primary (ACR20) and e.g. DAS28(CRP) endpoints, a logistic 
regression analysis with treatment groups and stratification factors in the model was used for statistical 
inference. For e.g. ACR20, the non-stratified response rate difference along with corresponding 95% CI 
were provided. Subjects who did not have sufficient measurements to establish efficacy were considered 
non-responders (i.e., non-responder imputation [NRI]). 
In the analyses of efficacy endpoints, stratification factors were included as covariates in the analysis 
model. If there were discrepancies in stratification factor values between the IWRS and the clinical 
database, the values recorded in the clinical database were to be used for analyses.  
For continuous endpoints, change from baseline in e.g. HAQ-DI and mTSS were analysed using a 
mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline value, stratification factors, treatment, 
visit, and treatment by visit interaction, included as fixed effects and subject being the random effect. The 
hypothesis testing for secondary analyses commenced after the primary analysis had reached statistical 
significance and was tested according to the hierarchical testing principle using a 2-sided 0.05 level. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Out of the 2582 patients screened, 1759 patients were randomized. Four subjects (2 in the filgotinib 200 
mg arm and 2 in the placebo arm) were randomized but not dosed. At cut-off date (of the initial 
submission), 304 (17.3%) had prematurely discontinued study drug. A similar proportion of subjects in 
the three active treatment arms had prematurely discontinued study drug. Up to the cut-off date (of the 
initial submission), 11.5% had prematurely discontinued study. 
Baseline data 
Most subjects were female (81.8%) and the mean (SD) age was 53 (12.7) years (safety analysis set).   
Presence of anti-CCP was 80.0% in Filgotinib 200 mg, 79.4% in Filgotinib 100 mg, 77.8% in Adalimumab 
and 79.6% in the Placebo group. Mean (SD) DAS28 CRP was 5.8 (0.88) in Filgotinib 200 mg, 5.7 (0.95) 
in Filgotinib 100 mg, 5.7 (0.88) in the Adalimumab and 5.7 (0.91) in the Placebo group. The proportion 
with Erosion score>0 was 84.0% in Filgotinib 200 mg, 85.6% in Filgotinib 100 mg, 85.2% in Adalimumab 
and 85.1% in the placebo group. 
Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised subjects (n=1759) who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug (n=1755); this was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  The Per-Protocol Analysis 
Set (n=1649) was the secondary analysis set for efficacy analyses on primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
For analyses based on FAS, subjects were grouped according to the treatment to which they were 
randomised.

Outcomes and estimation 
In FINCH 1, all superiority or noninferiority tests of filgotinib versus comparator in the hierarchical testing 
demonstrated a statistically significant superiority or noninferiority of filgotinib over the comparator (p < 
0.001), with the exception of the final noninferiority test of the percentages of subjects who achieved 
DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 (filgotinib 100 mg vs adalimumab; p = 0.054), see Table 13. 
Table 13: GS-US-417-0301: SAP 2, Hierarchical Testing of the Superiority of Filgotinib versus Placebo or 
Noninferiority versus Adalimumab 
For the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 12, the proportion of responders were 76.6% in the Filgotinib 
200 mgx1 (+MTX) group, 69.8% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1(+MTX) group, 70.8% in the Adalimumab (+ 
MTX) group and 49.9% in the placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between 
the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group).  
For the key secondary endpoint LDA (defined as DAS28 (CRP)≤3.2) at week 12, the proportion of 
responders were 49.7% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1(+MTX) group, 38.8% in the Filgotinib 100 
mgx1(+MTX) group, 43.4% in the adalimumab (+ MTX) group and 23.4% in the placebo (+ MTX) group 
(p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group and for 
the non-inferiority comparison of Filgotinib 200 mg group vs the adalimumab group). Non-inferiority of 
Filgotinib 200 mg vs adalimumab for DAS28(CRP) <= 3.2 at Week 12 was confirmed also in the 
Per-Protocol analysis. 
For the key secondary endpoint, change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at Week 12,  the mean (SD) 
was  -0.69 (0.613) in Filgotinib 200 mg(+ MTX), -0.56 (0.564) in Filgotinib 100mg(+ MTX), -0.61 (0.559) 
in Adalimumab (+ MTX) and -0.42 (0.544) in the Placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority 
comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group). 
For the key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects who achieve Remission (defined as DAS28 
(CRP)<2.6) at Week 24, the proportion of responders were 48.4% in the Filgotinib 200 mg (+ MTX) 
group, 35.2% in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+ MTX) group, 35.7% in the Adalimumab (+ MTX) group and 
16.2% in the placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between the Filgotinib 
groups and the placebo group). 
For the key secondary endpoint, change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 24, the mean (SD) was 0.13 
(0.937) in the Filgotinib 200 mg (+ MTX) group, 0.17 (0.905) in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+ MTX) group, 
0.16 (0.948) in the Adalimumab group (+ MTX) and 0.38 (1.408) in the Placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 
for both superiority comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group).

Numerically better outcomes were reported for both doses of Filgotinib compared to placebo for the PROs 
Change from Baseline in SF-36 PCS score at Week 12 and Change from Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue score 
at week 12 as well as for the CRP-independent outcome CDAI. 
Regarding long-time efficacy, at week 24, the number of ACR 20 responders in absolute numbers 
increased vs week 12 in all groups but in particular in the placebo group. This was true also for the 
numbers of subjects that achieved DAS28 (CRP) <2.6 and DAS28 (CRP) <= 3.2 at week 12 vs week 24. 
In response to the Day 120 LoQ, the final CSR with week 52-data was provided. The absolute number of 
ACR 20 responders in the Filgotinib 200 mg-group increased from week 12 to week 24 and did not 
decrease from week 24 to week 52. For the Filgotinib 100 mg group and the adalimumab group, a similar 
pattern was seen. The ACR 20 response increased among placebo subjects that subsequently received 
Filgotinib. For LDA, the absolute number of responders increased in all treatment groups through week 
12-24-52. Also with regards to remission, the absolute number of subjects increased from week 24 to 
week 52 in all three active treatment groups. Finally, data supporting maintenance of effect in HAQ-DI 
and ACR50 and ACR 70 as well as week 52 radiological data, were also presented. 
Ancillary analyses 
Compared to placebo, a beneficial effect of Filgotinib was seen across the analysed subgroups with regard 
to achievement of the primary endpoint, although there were some differences regarding for example the 
efficacy in seropositive vs seronegative, BMI, race and geographic region.

DMARD(s) Treatment  
Methods 
Study Participants and Treatments 
FINCH 2 is a placebo-controlled, csDMARD-add on study that included a third line population (failed or 
intolerant to at least 1 bDMARD) that were randomized to either Filgotinib 100 mgx1, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 
or placebo. There was a rescue-possibility to SOC at week 14 (in case ≥20% improvement in SJC and TJC 
had not been achieved). Concomitant csDMARDs included MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and 
leflunomide. Exclusion criteria include prior treatment B-cell depleting agent within 6 months prior to Day 
1 and use of non-cell depleting bDMARDs within 4 weeks prior to Day 1.  
Upon completion of the 24-week dosing period, all subjects, regardless of response, who had not 
discontinued the study due to toxicity, were given the option to screen for enrolment into the separate 
LTE study; FINCH 4. 
Objectives 
Primary objective  
To evaluate the effects of filgotinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA as 
measured by the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR20 response at Week 12 (superiority 
hypothesis).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 12. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints were (according to the protocol and SAP 2): The proportion of subjects 
who achieve DAS28 (CRP) ≤3.2 (=LDA) at Week 12 and Change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at 
Week 12. 
These primary and key secondary endpoints were also measured at time points up to Week 24 and over 
time from Day 1 through Week 24. Additional endpoints included measurements of DAS28(CRP) < 2.6, 
the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score, the FACIT-Fatigue score and CDAI. 
Statistical methods, randomisation and blinding 
Initially, approximately 423 subjects, 141 per treatment arm, were to be randomised to filgotinib 200 mg, 
filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo. Analogous study GS-US-417-0301 (FINCH1), the sample size was driven by 
a key secondary endpoint; change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12, implying a power >90% for the 
primary endpoint. Randomisation was performed using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) 
stratified by geographic region (group A to E), prior exposure to number of bDMARDs (< 3 or ≥3 
bDMARDs) and seropositivity (presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated 
peptide) antibody (Ab) at screening). Masking was achieved using double-dummy technique and seems 
to have been appropriate. 
Geographic region comprised 5 strata with the following countries included: 
•  Group A: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, 
Switzerland, United Kingdom, and USA; 
•  Group B: Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland; 
•  Group C: Argentina, Puerto Rico and Mexico; 
•  Group D: China; 
•  Group E: Japan 
The statistical analysis approach shared a number of features with FINCH1. The statistical methods used 
were described in two SAPs; the analysis plan version 1.0 (EMA) was dated 23 August 2018. The 
finalisation of the database and treatment unblinding was on the 24 August 2018. Two efficacy estimands, 
composite estimand and treatment-policy estimand were defined for the primary and key secondary 
efficacy endpoints, respectively and efficacy analysis were conducted using two datasets; On-treatment 
data and All available data (including data collected under standard of care). Analyses using both 
approaches were planned and have been performed for the primary as well as key secondary endpoints.  
For binary endpoints including the primary endpoint, statistical inference was based on the p-value from 
a logistic regression analysis with treatment groups and stratification factors in the model. Subjects who 
did not have sufficient measurements to establish efficacy at Week 12 were considered non-responders. 
In the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, this included subjects who had discontinued randomised 
treatment early or needed SOC due to inadequate treatment response. For the difference between 
treatment arms, the non-stratified ACR20 response rate difference along with corresponding 95% CI 
were provided. Continuous endpoints were analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) with baseline value, stratification factors, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction, 
included as fixed effects and subject being the random effect.

In the analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints, missing data was either handled using a 
non-responder imputation (categorical/response rates) or implicitly through the use of MMRM. 
The confirmatory hierarchical testing strategy comprised the primary endpoint and two key secondary 
endpoints; all three hypotheses for the comparison of the higher dose (200 mg) versus placebo were to 
be tested and found positive before the same hypotheses, including the analysis of the primary endpoint, 
was to be formally tested for the lower dose vs placebo.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Out of the 688 subjects screened, 449 subjects were randomised, and 448 subjects were both 
randomised and treated. Out of these, 108 subjects (24.1%) prematurely discontinued study drug 
(14.3% in the Filgotinib 200 mg group, 22.9% in the Filgotinib 100 mg group and 35.1% in the placebo 
group). Of the 52 subjects that discontinued study drug in the placebo group, 32 subjects discontinued 
due to lack of efficacy. Overall, 15.0% discontinued the study prematurely (8.2% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 
group, 15.0% in the Filgotinib 100 mg group and 21.6% in the placebo group). 
Baseline data 
Most subjects were female (80.4%) and the mean (SD) age was 56 (12.2) years. 
Presence of anti-CCP was 67.3% in Filgotinib 200 mg, 73.9% in Filgotinib 100 mg and 70.9% in placebo 
group. Mean (SD) DAS28 CRP was 5.9 (1.03) in Filgotinib 200 mg, 5.9 (0.98) in Filgotinib 100 mg and 5.9 
(0.86) in the placebo group. 
Number of prior bDMARD exposure ≥ 3 bDMARDs was 25.2% in the Filgotinib 200 mg, 22.2% in Filgotinib 
100 mg and 23.0% in the placebo group. Concurrent Methotrexate Use on First Dosing Date was 84.4% 
in Filgotinib 200 mg, 83.0% in Filgotinib 100 mg and 78.4% in the placebo group.  
Numbers analysed 
The FAS included all subjects who were randomised (n=449) and received at least 1 dose of study drugs 
(n=448) and was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. The Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set 
(n=397) was the secondary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
For analyses based on the FAS, subjects were grouped according to the treatment to which they were 
randomised. 
Outcomes and estimation 
In FINCH 2, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csMARD) or 100 mgx1 (+ csMARD) showed superiority over placebo 
(+csMARD) for the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, see Table 14.

Table 14: GS-US-417-0302: SAP 2–Hierarchical Testing of the Superiority of Filgotinib Versus Placebo 
(after the primary endpoint reached statistical signficance ) 
The proportion that attained the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 12, was 66.0% in the Filgotinib 200 
mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 57.5% in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+csDMARD) group and 31.1% in the placebo 
(+csDMARD) group (p<0.001 for both the comparison between the Filgotinib groups and placebo). 
For the key secondary endpoint, proportion of subjects who achieved LDA (defined as DAS28 [CRP] ≤ 3.2) 
at Week 12, it was 40.8% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 37.3% in the Filgotinib 100 
mgx1 (+csDMARD) group and 15.5% in the placebo (+csDMARD) group (p < 0.001 for both comparisons 
with placebo). 
For the key secondary endpoint change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at Week 12, the mean (SD) 
was -0.55 (0.590) in the Filgotinib 200 mg (+csDMARD) group, -0.48 (0.602) in the Filgotinib 100 mg 
(+csDMARD) group and -0.23 (0.547) in the placebo (+csDMARD) group. 
Numerically better response was seen for both tested doses of Filgotinib vs placebo with regards to SF-36 
PCS and FACIT-fatigue score at Week 12. Differences vs placebo was also seen for both doses with 
regards to the CRP-independent measure CDAI.   
Numerically better improvements were seen Filgotinib vs placebo for primary and key secondary 
endpoints from week 2-4 through week 24. In addition, data supporting an effect on ACR 50 and 70 week, 
12 and week 24, were presented. 
Ancillary analyses 
Compared to placebo, a beneficial effect of Filgotinib was seen across the investigated subgroups with 
regards to achievement of the primary endpoint although there were some differences regarding for 
example the efficacy in seropositive vs seronegative, BMI, race and geographic region. 
FINCH 3 (GS-US-417-0303): A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-controlled, Multicenter, 
Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Filgotinib Administered for 52 Weeks Alone and in 
Combination with Methotrexate (MTX) to Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid 
Arthritis Who Are Naïve to MTX Therapy 
Methods 
Study Participants and Treatments 
FINCH 3 is an active-controlled study that included a first line population (limited or no prior treatment 
with MTX) with at least one poor prognostic factor that were randomized to either Filgotinib 100 
mgx1+MTX, Filgotinib 200 mgx1+MTX, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 monotherapy or MTX monotherapy with a 
rescue-possibilities to SOC from week 24 (if a 20% improvement in both SJC and TJC was not reached). 
Antimalarials are included among the permitted concomitant medications.

After having completed this study, subject could continue in the LTE FINCH 4. 
Objectives 
Primary objective  
To evaluate the effects of filgotinib in combination with MTX versus MTX monotherapy for the treatment 
of signs and symptoms of RA as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 at Week 24 
(superiority hypothesis). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints in the protocol and in SAP 2 were: Change from baseline in the 
HAQ-DI score at Week 24, The proportion of subjects who achieved DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 at Week 24 
(=remission) and Change from baseline in the mTSS at Week 24. 
Statistical methods, randomisation and blinding 
The planned total sample size was 1200; 400 subjects for filgotinib 200 mg in combination with MTX 
group, 200 subjects for filgotinib 100 mg in combination with MTX group, 200 subjects for filgotinib 200 
mg alone group and 400 subjects for MTX alone group. The sample size was driven by the expected 
difference of filgotinib 200 mg + MTX versus MTX in change from baseline in mTSS at Week 24. The power 
for comparisons on the primary endpoint was >90%.  
Eligible subjects were randomised via an IWRS in a 2:1:1:2 ratio to filgotinib 200 mg + MTX, filgotinib 100 
mg + MTX, filgotinib 200 mg alone, or MTX alone, for up to 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by 
geographic region (Group A to E) and presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated 
peptide antibody (anti-CCP Ab) at screening. 
The regions included the following countries:  
•  Group A: United States of America, Spain, Germany, Republic of Korea, Canada, Belgium, South 
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland and Israel 
•  Group B: India, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Russian Federation, Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia, 
Romania and Slovakia 
•  Group C: Mexico, Argentina and Chile 
•  Group D: Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong 
•  Group E: Japan 
Masking of treatment was achieved by the use of placebo to match filgotinib tablets and placebo to match 
MTX capsules.  
The SAP Version 1.0 (EMA) was dated 31 January 2019. A planned Week 24 analysis was conducted after 
all subjects had either completed the Week 24 visit or had prematurely discontinued from the study. The 
date for the database finalisation and treatment unblinding for the current interim report was 17 January 
2019 and 01 February 2019, respectively. The final analysis of the data will be performed after all subjects 
have completed the study. The primary analyses consisted of a superiority test of filgotinib 200 mg + MTX 
Assessment report

compared with MTX monotherapy based on the primary endpoint. Superiority was tested at the 2-sided 
0.05-level. A logistic regression analysis with treatment groups and stratification factors in the model was 
used. Subjects who did not have sufficient measurements to establish efficacy at Week 24 were 
considered non-responders. If the superiority of filgotinib 200 mg + MTX over MTX monotherapy was 
established, hypothesis testing for the secondary analyses was initiated. The superiority of filgotinib 200 
mg + MTX or filgotinib 100 mg + MTX over MTX monotherapy was tested according to the hierarchical 
testing principle at the 2-sided 0.05-level. The change from baseline in HAQ-DI score, mTSS, SF-36 PCS, 
and FACIT-Fatigue score were analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). In 
addition to the FAS, analyses were based on the Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set, additional sensitivity 
analyses included observed case (OC) and last observation carried forward (LOCF) (for binary endpoints), 
multiple imputation (MI), and tipping point analyses. Analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints, as well as other secondary efficacy endpoints were repeated using all available data, including 
assessments collected under standard of care. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 1855 subjects screened, 1252 were randomized and 1249 were both randomized and dosed. Up to 
Week 24, 1130 of these 1249 subjects (90.5%) remained on study: 376 subjects (90.4%) in the filgotinib 
200 mg + MTX group, 193 subjects (93.2%) in the filgotinib 100 mg + MTX group, 188 subjects (89.5%) 
in the filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group, and 373 subjects (89.7%) in the MTX monotherapy group.  
Up to Week 24, 119 subjects (9.5%) of the 1249 subjects prematurely discontinued study drug and these 
were distributed as follows: filgotinib 200 mg + MTX: 40 subjects (9.6%); filgotinib 100 mg + MTX: 14 
subjects (6.8%); filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy: 22 subjects (10.5%); and MTX monotherapy: 43 
subjects (10.3%). 
Baseline data  
Most subjects were female (76.9%) and the mean (SD) age was 53 (13.6) years. 
In total, 9.4% had concurrent antimalarials use; 8.4% in the Filgotinib +MTX group, 11.6% in the 
Filgotinib 100 mg + MTX group, 8.6% in the Filgotinib monotherapy group and 9.9% in the MTX 
monotherapy group. Overall, 77.4% were DMARD naïve; ranging from 76.9% in the Filgotinib 200 mg + 
MTX group to 78.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group. 
Presence of aCCP was 69.0% in the Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX group, 69.1% in the Filgotinib 100 mg +MTX 
group, 63.3% in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 70.2%  in the MTX monotherapy group. 
Mean (SD) DAS28 CRP was 5.7 (0.99) in the Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX group, 5.7 (1.04) in the Filgotinib 
100 mg + MTX group, 5.8 (0.94) in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 5.7 (1.00) in the MTX 
monotherapy group. The proportion with Erosion Score > 0 was 94.2% in the Filgotinib 200 mg+MTX 
group, 95.7% in the Filgotinib 100 mg +MTX group, 94.8% in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group 
and 92.5% in the MTX monotherapy group. 
Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analysis used the FAS, which included all subjects who were randomized (n=1252) 
and received at least 1 dose of study drug (n=1249). The primary and key secondary endpoints were also 
evaluated based on the PP Analysis Set (n=1160), the secondary analysis set for efficacy analysis.

For analyses based on FAS, subjects were grouped according to the treatment to which they were 
randomized. 
Outcomes and estimation 
FINCH 3 met its primary endpoint demonstrating the superiority of filgotinib 200 mg + MTX over MTX 
monotherapy on the ACR20 response rate at Week 24. Moreover, Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX and Filgotinib 
100 mg + MTX demonstrated superiority over MTX monotherapy for ACR20, HAQ-DI, and DAS28(CRP) < 
2.6 at Week 24. The formal sequential testing according to SAP 2 was stopped at step 7 and only nominal 
significance was reported for the remaining hypotheses, see table below. 
Table 15: GS-US-417-0303: SAP 2, Hierarchical Testing of the Superiority of Filgotinib versus MTX 
Monotherapy at Week 24 (Full Analysis Set) 
For the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 24, this was reached by 81.0% in the Filgotinib 200 
mgx1+MTX group, 80.2% in the Filgotinib 100 mg x1+MTX group, 78.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 
monotherapy group and 71.4% in the MTX monotherapy group (p<0.05 for the two comparisons between 
Filgotinib combination therapy vs MTX).  
For the key secondary endpoint proportion with DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 i.e. remission at Week 24, this was 
achieved by 54.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 1x1 + MTX group, 42.5%, in the Filgotinib 100 mg 1x1+MTX, 
42.4% in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 29.1% in the MTX monotherapy group (p < 0.001 
for the comparisons with the two Filgotinib combination groups and MTX monotherapy group 
respectively). 
For the key secondary endpoint, change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at Week 24, the mean (SD) 
was -0.94 (0.721) in the Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX group, -0.90 (0.675) in the Filgotinib 100 mg +MTX 
group, -0.89 (0.631) in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and -0.79 (0.634) in the MTX 
monotherapy group (p<0.001 for the comparison between Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX and MTX 
monotherapy, p = 0.009 for the comparison between Filgotinib 100 mg + MTX vs MTX monotherapy) 
For the key secondary endpoint change from baseline in the mTSS at Week 24, the mean (SD) was 0.20 
(1.682) in the Filgotinib 200 mg group, 0.22 (1.530) in the Filgotinib 100 mg group, -0.04 (1.710) in the 
Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 0.52 (2.892) in the MTX monotherapy group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 74/170 
 
 
 
 
Change from Baseline in the PROs SF-36 PCS Score and Change from Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Score at 
Week 24 was numerically greater in all Filgotinib arms compared to the MTX monotherapy arm. Also, 
mean improvement from baseline to week 24 in the CRP-independent measure CDAI was numerically 
higher for each filgotinib group versus MTX monotherapy.  
Numerically greater ACR20 response rates versus MTX monotherapy were seen from Week 2 for the 
Filgotinib groups and through Week 24. This was observed also for the proportion of subjects in remission 
(DAS28 CRP<2.6).  
In response to the Day 120 LoQ, the final CSR with week 52-data was provided. In all four treatment 
groups there was a slight decrease in the absolute number of ACR 20 responders from week 24 to week 
52. In the Filgotinib + MTX arms, the absolute number in remission were essentially the same week 24 
and week 52 while it increased somewhat from week 24 to week 52 in the Filgotinib mono-arm and the 
MTX arm. Data supporting an effect of filgotinib on ACR 50, ACR 70 and HAQ-DI up to 1 year (52 weeks), 
as well as week 52 radiological data, were also presented. 
Ancillary analysis  
Compared to MTX monotherapy, a beneficial effect of Filgotinib measured as ACR 20 was present across 
investigated subgroups although there were some differences with regards to for example seropositivity, 
BMI, region, race and age.

Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no dedicated clinical studies focusing on efficacy in children, the elderly or patients with 
renal/hepatic impairment within the target indication (RA). 
The Applicant performed 3 phase 1 studies with filgotinib 100 mg in subjects: one with impaired hepatic 
function, one with renal impairment and one in elderly healthy subjects, please refer to Section 2.4. 
The number of subjects per age group in the filgotinib development programme is presented in Table 19.

The efficacy data to support all parts of this proposed indication derives from:

•  5 Phase II studies in an MTX-IR population (GLPG0634-CL-201, GLPG0634-CL-202, 
GLPG0634-CL-203, GLPG0634-CL-204; DARWIN 1-2 and the long-term extension study 
GLPG0634-CL-205; DARWIN 3) 
•  4 Phase III studies; in a MTX-IR population (Study GS-US-417-0301; FINCH 1), in a bDMARD-IR 
population (Study GS-US-417-0302; FINCH 2), in an MTX-naive population (Study 
GS-US-417-0303; FINCH 3), and one long-term extension study (Study GS-US-417-0304; 
FINCH 4).  
The duration of FINCH 2 (bDMARD-IR population) was only 24 weeks while the other two-phase III 
studies were of 52 weeks duration. In the initial submission, only data up to 24 weeks were included (in 
24 week-CSRs). In the response to the Day 120 LoQ, the final CSRs with week 52-data were provided.  
Long-term safety and efficacy data from FINCH 4 Study, that enrols subjects from the three Phase 3 
studies, will be submitted by 2Q 2021. 
Design and conduct of phase II studies; dose response studies 
Two completed 4-week Phase 2a studies; GLPG0634-CL-201 and GLPG0634-CL-202, explored once or 
twice daily filgotinib doses up to a total daily dose of 200 mg or 300 mg on top of MTX, respectively. Doses 
above 200 mg daily were not pursued in Phase 2b because an exposure-response analysis was considered 
to have demonstrated that responses were at plateau with the 200-mg daily dose.  
The phase 2b studies GLPG0634-CL-203; DARWIN 1 and GLPG0634-CL-204; DARWIN 2 included 
subjects exposed at 3 different daily doses of GLPG0634 i.e. filgotinib (i.e., 50, 100, and 200 mg daily) at 
2 dose regimens (once and twice daily administration). Both studies; the first MTX-add on, the second 
monotherapy, were conducted in the MTX-IR population and were randomized, double-blind and 
placebo-controlled, with ACR 20 at week 12 being the primary endpoint and an NRI-approach. The design 
of the phase IIb dose-finding studies, including the selection of the primary endpoint, are generally 
considered acceptable. 
Regarding DARWIN 2, it is noted that although this was considered as a monotherapy study, antimalarial 
DMARDs were included among the permitted medications. Given that a rather small proportion of 
subjects in the study were treated with antimalarials (approximately 10%), that this use was rather 
evenly distributed between the treatment groups and the known fairly modest treatment effect of 
antimalarials on RA, this condition is not expected to influence the overall conclusions to be drawn from 
this dose-finding study. However, as the Applicant indicated that the data from this study also supports 
the current monotherapy claim -and as this is actually the only study that provides data on monotherapy 
second line- the applicant was at Day 120 requested to re-analyse the data from this study (primary and 
key secondary endpoints with focus on endpoints reflecting low disease activity or remission) excluding 
subjects concomitantly treated with antimalarials (see outcome and discussion below). 
Design and conduct of phase III studies; main studies  
For the three Phase 3 RCT, the primary analysis consisted of a superiority test of filgotinib based on the 
ACR20 response rate (at week 12 in FINCH 1,2 and at week 24 in FINCH 3) with an NRI-approach.  
FINCH 1 is a placebo and active-controlled MTX-add on study that included a second line population 
(active RA despite MTX-treatment) with poor prognostic factors that were randomized to either Filgotinib 
100 mgx1, Filgotinib 200 mgx1, the TNF-inhibitor adalimumab or placebo, with a rescue-possibility (to 
SOC) at week 14. In addition to MTX, concomitant anti-malarial csDMARDs were allowed but no other 
csDMARDs. The patient population, overall design, timepoint for rescue and choice of comparator are in 
line with EMA RA guideline and previous SA. The choice of primary endpoint is not consistent with the new 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 84/170 
 
 
 
EMA RA guideline from 2017 but was discussed at a central SA in 2016. In the SA, the CHMP commented 
that remission at month 6 or LDA at month 3, was the recommended endpoint and if the applicant would 
like to choose an ACR response measure as a primary endpoint and LDA as key secondary and testing 
both using a hierarchical strategy, the CHMP would consider the study positive if both endpoints were 
positive. Based on this advice, the outcome of the secondary endpoints reflecting LDA or remission was 
carefully considered in the evaluation of the outcome from FINCH 1.  
FINCH 2 is a placebo-controlled, csDMARD-add on study that included a third line population (failed or 
intolerant to at least 1 bDMARD) that were randomized to either Filgotinib 100 mgx1, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 
or placebo with a rescue-possibility (to SOC) at week 14. Concomitant csDMARDs included MTX, 
hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and leflunomide and these are indeed considered as relevant 
csDMARDs to be tested in combination with the new drug. Overall, the study design is in line with relevant 
EMA guidelines regarding confirmatory RA trials and the timepoint for rescue is in line with the given 
central advice. However, the two following issues require some additional consideration. 
First, in the SA April 2016, it was commented that the patient population to be studied in FINCH 2 was 
heterogeneous (as it included a mix of true third line patients and patients intolerant to bDMARDs that 
could be considered as second line population if the treatment duration was <3 months) and that across 
such mix, the most appropriate selection of primary endpoint could differ. It was stated that if the 
originally proposed heterogenous study population was to be maintained, the following requirements 
would at least have to be met: 1) the ACR 20 primary endpoint but would need to be supported by 
consistent results for LDA as key secondary endpoint and 2) the study would have be sufficiently large to 
support subgroup analyses across the heterogenous population so that consistency of effect for both 
AC20 and LDA could be verified. These remarks were considered when evaluating the main outcomes of 
the study (see below). It is noted that ACR 20 is the primary endpoint of FINCH 2 study but LDA, 
expressed as DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2, at week 12 is a ranked key secondary endpoint. 
Second, in the relevant EMA RA guideline, the potential for residual response of prior bDMARD at the time 
of inclusion and sudden deterioration if the prior bDMARD is suddenly discontinued (potentially inflating 
treatment effect) is underlined. According to the study protocol, exclusion criteria include: 1) Prior 
treatment B-cell depleting agents within 6 months prior to Day 1 and 2) Use of non-cell depleting 
bDMARDs within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Although any loss of partial bDMARD-response is probably 
similarly distributed in all three treatment groups (due to randomization) and thus it would be expected 
that the three treatment groups would be equally affected, the applicant was at Day 120 asked to discuss 
the issue and whether observed treatment effects could have been inflated. In response to the question, 
the applicant stated that although withdrawal of prior bDMARD therapy could have resulted in a 
worsening of disease, withdrawal was mandated uniformly in all treatment groups for subjects who failed 
1 or more bDMARDs, were intolerant to bDMARDs, or used specific bDMARDs. A majority of the subjects 
had a longer washout period than what was required by the protocol and that there was no meaningful 
imbalance noted that would introduce significant bias favouring filgotinib over placebo. Tabulated data 
that support this statement was provided. Based on this, the CHMP agreed that the risk that residual 
response of prior bDMARD would potentially inflate the treatment effect and introduce bias favouring 
filgotinib, is low. 
FINCH 3 is an active-controlled study that included a first line population (limited or no prior treatment 
with MTX) with at least one poor prognostic factor that were randomized to either Filgotinib 100 
mgx1+MTX, Filgotinib 200 mgx1+MTX, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 monotherapy or MTX monotherapy with a 
rescue-possibility (to SOC) at week 24. Overall, the study design and choice of MTX as a comparator are 
in line with relevant guidelines. However, the two following issues require some additional consideration: 
First, antimalarials are included among the permitted concomitant medications and thus the treatment 
arm referred to as the Filgotinib monotherapy arm is actually not a monotherapy arm in the strictest 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 85/170 
 
 
 
sense. As in total, only 9.4% had concurrent antimalarials, since this use has a fairly even distribution 
among treatment groups and since the treatment effect of antimalarial DMARDs is known to be rather 
modest, this condition is not expected to have any major impact on the overall study results. However, to 
verify this preliminary view and to get a more precise view of the performance of Filgotinib given as true 
monotherapy (which is important given the proposed wording of the indication) the applicant was 
requested to re-analyse the data with regards to the primary and key secondary endpoints excluding 
subjects on concomitant anti-malarias (see outcome and discussion below). 
Second, as stated in the relevant EMA RA guidelines, for studies on the treatment on naïve patients, 
remission at 3 or 6 months is the preferred endpoint. The outcome of this endpoint should be 
corroborated by the other outcomes such as CDAI.  In FINCH 3, the proportion of subjects who achieved 
remission defined as DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 at Week 24 was included as a secondary, ranked endpoint and 
special consideration will be given to the outcome of this endpoint as it is considered the most relevant for 
the study population. CDAI was measured in the study and the outcome of this endpoint will also be given 
extra attention.  
Statistical considerations  
All the three phase 3 studies, FINCH1, FINCH2 and FINCH3 were run in parallel and shared a number of 
features implying similarities in the planned statistical analyses that overall are considered appropriate 
but which required clarifications for a few minor issues. For all three studies, there were two SAPs based 
on different regional regulatory feedback foremost concerning differences in mutual importance of 
endpoints, analysis time-points and treatment comparisons. In all three phase 3 studies multiple 
comparison were planned given the two dose arms of filgotinib and, in one study (FINCH1) due to two 
comparators, besides placebo also adalimumab. In addition, a number of key secondary endpoints (same 
but for mTSS in the shorter 24-week study (FINCH2)) were defined and several hypotheses were thereby 
included in the confirmatory testing hierarchy. This approach was agreed by the CHMP. A comment in the 
CHMP scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/209886/2016) concerned the importance of a hierarchy that 
could be justified based on clinical relevance. In SAP 2 (EMA), the hierarchy implied that the 200 mg dose 
was tested first for the primary and key secondary endpoints before the testing of the 100 mg dose 
commenced. Within the same scientific advice procedure, the non-inferiority comparison versus 
adalimumab (Study 417-0301/FINCH-1) was criticised with regard to the proposed retention method.  
The Applicant retained this method and thereby there was no unambiguous definition of the NI margin, no 
clinical rational offered and no discussion clarifying expected DAS28 (CRP)≤3.2 response rates at week 12 
more than expected to be similar in the filgotinib and adalimumab arm, respectively. However, with the 
primary analysis already performed this is now a matter of assessment (see below).. 
In all three phase 3 studies, one primary (composite) and one secondary (treatment policy) estimand 
were defined that each were aligned with one of two datasets; on-treatment data and all available data, 
respectively. In primary analyses the data set comprised only data collected while the subject was on 
randomised treatment ignoring any data collected after the occurrence of an intercurrent event. 
Intercurrent events where defined as intake of SOC medications due to inadequate response, study 
treatment discontinuation and study discontinuation. For the primary composite estimand the occurrence 
of an intercurrent event was taken to be a component of the variable, here implying that for a subject to 
be a responder for the primary endpoint (ACR20), besides a successful clinical outcome was required not 
to have discontinued randomised treatment. For secondary analyses, the data set comprised all available 
data i.e. also measurements observed after a subject had discontinued randomised treatment but stayed 
in the study on standard of care (instead ignoring the occurrence of an intercurrent event). Albeit both 
approaches are of interest for an assessment of robustness, it could be questioned whether the primary 
estimand is equally relevant irrespective of comparison (placebo, adalimumab (FINCH1)) and objective 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 86/170 
 
 
 
(superiority or non-inferiority). Analyses using both estimand strategies were pre-planned and have been 
performed for the primary as well as all key secondary endpoints. However, being difficult to compare the 
outcomes of the different analyses offered, additional tables showing the outcomes from the analyses 
based on the two data sets were requested for all three phase 3 studies. In their response to D120 LoQ, 
the applicant stated that week 52 data were used for the requested analysis. No new analyses were 
requested but easily digestible summaries of the different analyses performed for the primary analysis of 
each study respectively. It is assumed that outcomes currently provided are the same as in the original 
analysis. In comparing outcomes using the on-treatment data approach with the all-available data, the 
latter ignoring SoC, no concern was raised what regards the already drawn conclusions concerning the 
efficacy of treatment with filgotinib. Overall, there were generally only minor differences in point 
estimates and/or CIs and none that alters any conclusion per se. The presentation of outcomes based on 
on-treatment data in the Section 5.1 of the SmPC was therefore accepted by the CHMP.  
In the analyses of efficacy endpoints, stratification factors were included as covariates in the analysis. 
This was agreed by the CHMP. However, if there were discrepancies between the IWRS and the clinical 
database, the values recorded in the clinical database were to be used in the analyses that hence, not 
necessarily reflected randomisation restrictions. Being unclear whether there were any discrepancies, the 
applicant was requested to clarify and, if there were discrepancies for a non-negligible proportion of 
subjects, provide additional analyses using values according to IWRS. As clarified by the applicant, there 
were some small discrepancies in stratification factors between the interactive web response system 
(IWRS) and the clinical database. The proportions in each study has been described. As clear from now 
presented point estimates for the primary endpoint (ACR20) in all three studies comparing analyses using 
values according to IWRS and the clinical database respectively, none of the discrepancies seemed to 
have any impact on the outcomes. 
For categorical endpoints, including the primary (ACR20) and e.g. DAS28(CRP) endpoints, a logistic 
regression analysis with treatment groups and stratification factors in the model was used for statistical 
inference. For the estimation of treatment differences for e.g. ACR20, the non-stratified response rate 
difference along with corresponding 95% CI were provided. While acceptable that inference and 
estimation can be based on different tests/analysis methods, here this implied that the stratification 
factors were considered in analyses for inference however not for the estimation of the treatment effect. 
A comparison of outcomes from both adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models as well as SAS 
outputs were requested to comprehend the impact of the stratification variables on estimated treatment 
differences. No clear justification was provided for the approaches using different methods for inference 
and estimation, but the applicant’s answer is interpreted as a wish to avoid odd ratios in the presentation 
of filgotinib treatment efficacy. The CHMP agreed that results overall, adjusted compared to unadjusted 
outcomes, were very similar with hence only minor differences, generally in favour of adjusted analyses. 
Given this and convincing p-values, importantly, overall conclusions are the same (irrespective of 
analysis).   
The main analyses of the primary endpoint followed a “NRI” (Non-responder Imputation) approach in the 
studies. In case collected data for the primary efficacy assessment was insufficient to calculate ACR20, 
observations were imputed as non-responders.  
• 
• 
FINCH 1: there were 40/475 patients with imputed response due to missing outcomes data in the 
placebo arm, vs. 20/475 in the filgotinib 200 mg, 27/480 in the filgotinib 100 mg, 15/325 in the 
adalimumab arm. 
FINCH 2: there were 21/148 patients with imputed response due to missing outcomes data in the 
placebo arm, vs. 11/147 in the filgotinib 200 mg and 13/153 in the filgotinib 100 mg arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 87/170 
 
 
 
• 
FINCH 3: it was more balanced in FINCH 3: 47/417 in the placebo arm, vs. 43/416 in the filgotinib 
200 mg + MTX arm, 18/207 in the filgotinib 100 mg + MTX arm, 25/210 in the filgotinib 200 mg 
monotherapy arm.  
Overall, in order to appreciate the risk of estimate biases, the Applicant was asked to further discuss the 
imputed observations in the analysis of primary ACR20 in studies FINCH 1, FINCH 2 and FINCH 3. In most 
cases, the missing responses corresponded in fact to patients who discontinued treatment prematurely; 
this was more frequent in the control groups across the studies. Only few evaluable patients had missing 
ACR assessment across randomization arms (incomplete or completely missing). Taken together, there is 
no concern what regards a risk that the imputation introduced any important bias. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Data from the phase II studies; dose response studies 
In GLPG0634-CL-201 (MTX add-on), 36 MTX-IRs subjects were randomized. At Week 4, the number and 
percentage of ACR20 responders (the primary efficacy endpoint) was 4 (33.3%), 9 (75.0%), and 11 
(91.7%) in the placebo, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 and the Filgotinib 100 mgx2 groups, respectively. 
In GLPG0634-CL-202 (MTX add-on), 91 MTX-IRs subjects were randomized and received study 
treatment. At Week 4, the percentage of subjects achieving ACR20 response (the primary endpoint) in 
the placebo group was 41.2% and in the Filgotinib 30 mg/day, Filgotinib 75 mg/day, Filgotinib 150 
mg/day and Filgotinib 300 mg/day groups: 35.3%, 54.5%, 40.0%, and 65.0%, respectively. 
In GLPG0634CL203; DARWIN 1 (MTX add-on), 594 subjects were randomized and treated. The outcome 
of the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 12, was: 44.2% in the placebo group, 56.1% in 50 
mgx1 group, 63.5% in the 100 mgx1 group, 68.6% in the 200 mgx1, 57.0% in the 25 mgx1 group, 
60.0% in the 50 mgx2, 78.6% in the 100 mgx2 group (p-values<0.05 for the comparison vs placebo for 
the 100 mgx1, 200 mgx1 and 100 mgx2 groups). Dose-dependent responses were observed in the 
majority of these secondary efficacy parameters including proportion of subjects achieving 
remission/LDA. It is noted that the level of response with regards to the primary endpoint was different in 
the four investigated regions and tended to be lower in EU than in the other three regions. However, as 
the effect size vs placebo was comparable in the 4 regions, the issue was not further pursued by the 
CHMP. 
In GLPG0634-CL-204; DARWIN 2 (monotherapy study), 283 subjects were randomized and treated. It is 
noted that according to the inclusion criteria, eligible subjects had to have shown an inadequate response 
in terms of either lack of efficacy or toxicity to MTX but according to the presented baseline data, only 84.1 
% had prior use of MTX and 7.8% had prior use of MTX sodium. However, 97.5 % had previous treatment 
with csDMARD which means that this is still a representative second line population. 
The outcome of the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 12, was: 29.2% in the placebo group, 
66.7% in the 50 mgx1 group, 65.7% in the 100 mgx1 group and 72.5% in the 200 mgx1 group 
(p<0.0001 for all comparisons vs placebo). The level of response with regard to the primary endpoint was 
different in the four investigated regions and tended to be lower in EU than in the other three regions, 
however the effect size vs placebo was similar in the 4 regions. 
The outcome for the secondary endpoint DAS28 (CRP) remission or LDA at Weeks 12 (NRI [ITT 
Population]) was as follows at week 12: 13.9% (10/72) in the placebo group, 23.6% (17/72) in the 50 
mgx1 group, 27.1% (19/70) in the 100 mgx1 group and 44.9% (31/69) in the 200 mgx1 group 
(p-value<0.05 for the comparison of the 200 mg group vs placebo). At week 24 the proportion with 
Assessment report

DAS28 (CRP) remission or LDA was 34.7% in the 50 mgx1 group, 50.0% in the 100 mgx1 group and 
42.0% in the 200 mgx1 group. 
In response to the Day 120 LoQ, a re-analyse of important endpoints in DARWIN 2 excluding subjects 
concomitant antimalarials were conducted. The outcome in all study subjects vs subjects without 
antimalarials (FAS, NRI) were compared. The proportion of subjects with LDA at week 12 was similar in 
the three different treatment groups (Filgotinib 200 mg, Filgotinib 100 mg, placebo) for all subjects vs 
subjects without antimalarials. Such coherence was seen also for the other presented endpoints including 
ACR 20, which was the primary efficacy endpoint of this study and remission. The CHMP agreed with the 
applicant that the results in this monotherapy second line study were similar for subjects without 
antimalarials as compared to the overall study population. 
Following the phase II studies, the applicant had initially selected only the 200 mgx1 dose to be tested in 
the phase 3 programme. As this was questioned by the SAWP/CHMP, both the 100 mg once daily and 200 
mg once daily-doses were then ultimately chosen for the phase 3 studies. Overall, treatment with these 
doses conferred a clinically relevant effect vs placebo in the studied MTX-IR (second line) population both 
in the MTX add-on and monotherapy setting. Given the clinical efficacy data (including the dose-response 
observed) and the clinical safety data from this phase 2 studies, the selection of doses is considered 
acceptable. Of note, this would provide some support for the efficacy of filgotinib as monotherapy second 
line. 
From the week 156- interim CSR of GLPG0634-CL-205; DARWIN 3, the long term follow-up that included 
subjects that received filgotinib monotherapy (n = 242, rolled over from parent study DARWIN 2) or 
filgotinib with MTX (n = 497, rolled over from parent study DARWIN 1), there are indications that the 
treatment effect of filgotinib (as monotherapy or in combination with MTX) is maintained for up to 3 years 
in patients. The majority of subjects were on 200 mg Filgotinib/day. It is noted that 229/491 MTX-IR 
subjects in the MTX + Filgotinib group had low disease activity at baseline and 200/290 subjects had low 
disease activity at week 156. For the monotherapy group, the numbers were 97/234 and 88/136. This is, 
together with the week 52 phase III data (see below), considered consistent with maintenance of efficacy.  
Data from the phase III studies; main studies 
In GS-US-417-0301, FINCH 1, the second line MTX-add on study, 1755 subjects were randomized and 
treated. All superiority or noninferiority tests of filgotinib versus comparator in the hierarchical testing 
demonstrated a statistically significant superiority or noninferiority of filgotinib over the comparator (p < 
0.001), with the exception of the final noninferiority test of the percentages of subjects who achieved 
DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 (filgotinib 100 mg vs adalimumab; p = 0.054). Non-inferiority of Filgotinib 
200 mg vs adalimumab (for DAS28(CRP) <= 3.2 at Week 12) was confirmed also in the Per-Protocol 
analysis. 
For the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 12, the proportion of responders were 76.6% in the Filgotinib 
200 mgx1 (+MTX) group, 69.8% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1(+MTX) group, 70.8% in the 
Adalimumab(+MTX) group and 49.9% in the placebo(+MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority 
comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group). For the key secondary endpoint of 
special regulatory interest, LDA at week 12, the proportion of responders were 49.7% in the Filgotinib 200 
mgx1 (+MTX) group, 38.8% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1(+MTX) group, 43.4% in the adalimumab (+MTX) 
group and 23.4% in the placebo (+MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between the 
Filgotinib groups and the placebo group). The differences for the Filgotinib groups vs placebo for these 
endpoints were both statistically significant and clinically relevant. 
Across endpoints, the short-term effect in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 group (on top of MTX) was consistently 
numerically better than in the other treatment groups (Filgotinib 100 mgx1, adalimumab or placebo on 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 89/170 
 
 
 
top of MTX). This was noted for the proportion of subjects that achieved remission and disease activity, 
the most informative endpoints in this patient population, and for the radiological endpoint included 
among the key secondary endpoints (change from Baseline in mTSS). Numerically better improvements 
in the Filgotinib 200 mg group vs the other groups were finally seen for PROs and the CRP-independent 
outcome CDAI that were included as other endpoints in the study. Overall, not only the effect in the 
Filgotinib group 200 mgx1 (+MTX) group but also the effect in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1 (+MTX) group is 
of clinical relevance. There was a consistent and distinct difference for the Filgotinib 100 mgx1 (+MTX) 
group vs placebo (+MTX) and overall the observed magnitude of effect in the Filgotinib 100 mg 
(+MTX)-group was similar to what was observed in the active comparator adalimumab (+MTX) group. 
The outcome with regards to the primary endpoint in FINCH 1 is largely consistent with the outcome in the 
phase IIb study DARWIN 1 which also included MTX-IRs and was a MTX add-on study. 
For the interpretation of the subgroup analysis, it should be noted that randomization was stratified by 
geographic region, prior exposure to biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), and 
presence of RF or anti-CCP at screening. Compared to placebo, a beneficial effect of Filgotinib was seen 
across the investigated subgroups with regards to achievement of the primary endpoint, although there 
were some differences regarding for example the efficacy in seropositive vs seronegative, BMI, race and 
geographic region. The outcome of the subgroup analysis of the key secondary endpoints which was 
provided in the response to the D120 LoQ, overall supported the conclusion of consistent treatment 
effect. 
Taken together, the observed short-term efficacy of both the studied doses of filgotinib on top of MTX in 
the MTX-IR population are of clear clinical relevance and of similar magnitude as the effect of the active 
comparator adalimumab. Depending on the safety profile of Filgotinib, both the tested doses could be 
considered for the finally recommended posology (currently, the applicant proposes 200 mgx1 as the 
primary posology, reserving 100 mgx1 for patients with reduced renal function). The part of the proposed 
indication covering second line treatment in combination with MTX can be considered supported by the 
submitted data. 
Regarding long-time efficacy, at week 24, the number of ACR 20 responders in absolute numbers 
increased vs week 12 in all groups but in particular in the placebo group. This was true also for the 
numbers of subjects that achieved DAS28 (CRP) <2.6 and DAS28 (CRP) <= 3.2 at week 12 vs week 24. 
In response to the D120 LoQ, it was reported that the absolute number of responders in the Filgotinib 200 
mg-group did not decrease from week 24 to week 52. For the Filgotinib 100 mg group and the 
adalimumab group, a similar pattern was seen. The ACR 20 response increased among placebo subjects 
that subsequently received Filgotinib. For LDA, the absolute number of responders increased in all 
treatment groups through week 12-24-52. Also with regards to remission, the absolute number of 
subjects increased from week 24 to week 52 in all three active treatment groups. It was clarified that for 
subjects who discontinued study drug and received standard of care, their efficacy data collected after 
receiving standard of care (from Week 14 and onwards) were excluded and treated as missing and 
missing binary efficacy data were imputed as non-responders.  
The applicant also showed that in all groups, a step up in ACR20 response from Week 12 to Week 14 was 
observed. This step up was larger in the placebo group compared with the active treatment groups. Week 
14 was the first time point that blinded study drug had to be discontinued for subjects with an inadequate 
response, as defined in the protocol. The applicant states that as both subjects and investigators were 
aware of the requirement to discontinue blinded study drug, there may have been a bias toward reporting 
higher response rates and that this potential bias (which according to the applicant has been observed in 
other clinical studies) may have contributed to the placebo rate being higher at Week 24 compared with 
Week 12.

Taken together, the CHMP agreed that treatment efficacy of Filgotinib is maintained on a group-level for 
up to 1 year for both Filgotinib doses as add-on to MTX in the MTX-IR population in FINCH 1. Efficacy even 
appeared to improve not only from week 12 to week 24 but also from week 24 to week 52 which is 
unexpected. It is further noted that the proportion of ACR 20 responders in the adalimumab (+MTX) arm 
is somewhat higher than expected (and reported for adalimumab + MTX in the adalimumab PI) but in 
particular the proportion of ACR 20 responders in the placebo group at week 12 and 24 are higher than 
what would have been expected. However, as there is a clear difference for Filgotinib vs placebo at all 
timepoints and (at least) comparable effect to adalimumab, as there was a clear increase in the number 
of responders after the placebo subjects had been re-randomized to Filgotinib at week 24 and as the 
outcome in the comparator arms are clearly presented in the SmPC along with the outcome in the 
Filgotinib arms, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP.  
Finally, in response to the RSI, radiological measurements up to week 52 were provided and are reflected 
in the approved product information.In GS-US-417-0302, FINCH 2, the third line csDMARD-add on study, 
448 subjects were randomized and treated. Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csDMARD) or 100 mgx1 (+ csDMARD) 
showed superiority over placebo (+csDMARD) for the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints. 
The outcome for the LDA-endpoint is of particular importance and there was a clear and clinically relevant 
difference between Filgotinib (both the high and low dose) vs placebo for this endpoint. Also, for the 
CRP/ESR-independent endpoint CDAI differences for Filgotinib vs placebo were noted. Overall, 15.0% 
discontinued the study prematurely with the highest number in the placebo group and lowest number in 
the Filgotinib 200 mg group. This imbalance is not expected to change the main, clearly positive, outcome 
of the study; at least not the outcome of the primary and key secondary endpoints assessed at week 12, 
a timepoint at which a higher number were still in the study (only about 10% of the number in the primary 
analysis appears to have been imputated while 90% were observed). 
The proportion that attained the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 12, was 66.0% in the Filgotinib 200 
mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 57.5% in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+csDMARD) group and 31.1% in the placebo 
(+csDMARD) group (p<0.001 for both the comparison between the Filgotinib groups and placebo). For 
the secondary endpoint of special regulatory interest, proportion of subjects who achieved DAS28(CRP) ≤ 
3.2 at Week 12, it was 40.8% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 37.3% in the Filgotinib 100 
mgx1 (+csDMARD) group and 15.5% in the placebo (+csDMARD) group (p < 0.001 for both comparisons 
with placebo). 
Consistently, the results in the Filgotinib 200 mg arm were numerically better than in the Filgotinib 100 
mg arm but the differences were not large. Relevant differences vs placebo was seen for both doses with 
regards to ACR response and LDA as presented above but also with regards to function as measured by 
HAQ and the ESR/CRP-independent measure CDAI. Consequently, the CHMP considered that both 
Filgotinib doses could be included in the recommended primary posology. 
Numerically better improvements were seen Filgotinib vs placebo for primary and key secondary 
endpoints from week 2-4 through week 24. In all three groups, the absolute number of subjects that was 
considered as responders with regards to the primary study endpoint was roughly similar week 24 
compared to week 12. However, in GS-US-417-0302 / FINCH 2, maintenance of effect beyond 24 weeks 
could not be demonstrated and such evidence, as well as data on radiographic progression, needs to 
come from other studies in the development programme. 
Filgotinib appears effective across subgroups with regards to promoting ACR 20 response. Randomization 
was stratified by the number of bDMARDs: < 3 or ≥ 3 (as well as region and positive serology) and ACR 20 
responses at week 12 were similar in these two subgroups. This is important considering the discussion in 
the previous SA. It is further noted that also the proportion of subjects that achieved LDA at week 12 was 
similar in subjects exposed to < 3 or ≥ 3 bDMARDs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 91/170 
 
 
 
Compared to placebo, a beneficial effect of Filgotinib was seen across analysed subgroups with regards to 
achievement of the primary endpoint although there were some differences regarding for example the 
efficacy in seropositive vs seronegative, BMI, race and geographic region. In the response to the D120 
LoQ, the applicant conducted additional subgroup analyses addressing previous treatment experience 
and based on this it can be concluded that the effects of filgotinib appear consistent regardless of MoA and 
number of prior exposures to bDMARDs. There was a numerical difference vs placebo in all analysed 
subgroups. The efficacy of filgotinib was further evaluated in subjects with bDMARD intolerance compared 
with the overall subject population using ACR20 at Week 12, and DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 and DAS28(CRP) ≤ 
3.2 at Weeks 12 and 24. Although small differences were observed, the efficacy in this subgroup appeared 
generally similar to the outcome in the overall population. The intolerant group constituted only 103/448 
subjects in the FAS (23%) limiting the impact of the outcome in this subgroup on the result in the overall 
population. 
The conclusion that Filgotinib has a beneficial effect across the entire (in some respects) heterogeneous 
study population, was overall supported by the outcome in the different baseline factor subgroups that 
was provided for all key endpoints in the FINCH 2 study with the responses to the D120 LoQ. 
In conclusion, the results overall indicate that Filgotinib given on top of csDMARDs to bDMARD-IR subjects 
are clearly better than placebo and the effect is observed from week 2-4 to week 24. 
It is noted that GS-US-417-0302 / FINCH 2 is essentially the only study in the clinical development 
programme for Filgotinib designed to provide efficacy data for Filgotinib on top of csDMARD (i.e. not only 
on-top of MTX). The setting of this study is third line. Permitted csDMARDs included MTX, 
hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide. However, a clear majority in this study was treated with 
MTX (84.4% in Filgotinib 200 mg, 83.0% in Filgotinib 100 mg and 78.4% in the placebo group). The 
efficacy data from this study is considered supportive of the part of the indication that consists of 
combination therapy third line. 
In GS-US-417-0303; FINCH 3, the first line study, 1249 subjects were randomized and treated. On 
average the included subjects had high disease activity as measured by DAS28 CRP (DAS28-CRP >5.1) 
and most patients (>90%) had at least one erosion.  
FINCH 3 met its primary endpoint demonstrating the superiority of filgotinib 200 mg + MTX over MTX 
monotherapy on the ACR20 response rate at Week 24. Moreover, Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX and Filgotinib 
100 mg + MTX demonstrated superiority over MTX monotherapy for ACR20, HAQ-DI, and DAS28(CRP) < 
2.6 at Week 24. The formal sequential testing according to SAP 2 was stopped at step 7 and only nominal 
significance was reported for the remaining hypotheses. However, numerically lower radiographic 
progression from baseline was observed in the mTSS at week 24 for the filgotinib 200 mg + MTX, filgotinib 
100 mg + MTX and filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy groups compared with the MTX monotherapy group. 
Numerically higher improvements for the ESR/CRP-independent outcome-measure CDAI in the three 
Filgotinib groups vs the MTX monotherapy group were also noted. 
With regards to the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 24, this was reached by 81.0% in the 
Filgotinib 200 mgx1+MTX group, 80.2% in the Filgotinib 100 mg x1+MTX group, 78.1% in the Filgotinib 
200 mg monotherapy group and 71.4% in the MTX monotherapy group (p<0.05 for the two comparisons 
between Filgotinib combination therapy vs MTX). For the secondary endpoint of special interest, 
proportion with DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 (remission) at Week 24, this was achieved by 54.1% in the Filgotinib 
200 mg 1x1 + MTX group, 42.5%, in the Filgotinib 100 mg 1x1+MTX, 42.4% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 
monotherapy group and 29.1% in the MTX monotherapy group (p < 0.001 for the comparisons with the 
two Filgotinib combination groups and MTX monotherapy group respectively). The proportion of ACR 20 
responders at week 24 were indeed numerically higher in all Filgotinib treatment arms compared to MTX 
monotherapy but the differences were not large between any of the arms in the study. However, with 
regards to the more relevant endpoint proportion of subjects in remission (DAS28 CRP<2.6) at week 24, 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 92/170 
 
 
 
the magnitude of the difference between the arms were larger (Filgotinib high dose + MTX vs low dose 
+MTX or high dose monotherapy as well as Filgotinib monotherapy vs MTX monotherapy) and considered 
clinically meaningful.  
Numerically greater ACR20 response rates versus MTX monotherapy were seen from Week 2 for the 
Filgotinib groups and through Week 24. This was observed also for the proportion of subjects in remission 
(DAS28 CRP<2.6).  
It is noted that there were 50 additional ACR 20 responders from week 12 to week 24 in the MTX-group 
which is of interest as individual response to MTX treatment is usually assessed at 3-4 months. The 
increase in ACR 20 response between week 12 and 24 was not as prominent in the Filgotinib arms. 
Regarding the number of subjects that achieved DAS28 CRP<2.6, there was an apparent increase 
between 12 and 24 weeks for all treatment groups including the MTX-group, in which 50 additional 
subjects became responders. 
In all four treatment groups there was a slight decrease in the absolute number of ACR 20 responders 
from week 24 to week 52. In the Filgotinib + MTX arms, the absolute number in remission were 
essentially the same week 24 and week 52 while it increased somewhat from week 24 to week 52 in the 
Filgotinib mono-arm and the MTX arm. The latter observation is unexpected but as there is a clear 
difference for the Filgotinib groups vs the MTX group at both timepoints, the issue will not be further 
pursued. Overall, it is agreed that treatment efficacy is maintained on a group-level for up to 1 year for 
both Filgotinib +MTX (in the two tested doses), Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy and MTX monotherapy in 
the MTX naïve patients in FINCH 3. 
In response to questions to the CHMP, radiological measurements up to week 52 were provided. At Week 
52, a numerically greater proportion of subjects in the filgotinib 200 mg + MTX group had no radiographic 
progression compared with the MTX monotherapy group. 
Overall, there were no unexpected findings in the subgroup analysis or the sensitivity analysis. When 
interpreting the subgroup analysis, it should be noted that randomization was stratified by geographic 
region and presence of either RF or anti-CCP. Compared to MTX monotherapy, a beneficial effect of 
Filgotinib measured as ACR 20 seemed to be present across the investigated subgroups although some 
differences with regards to for example seropositivity, BMI, region, race and age were noted. The 
outcome in the different baseline factor subgroups for all key endpoints, which was provided as a 
response to the D120 LoQ, supported the conclusion of overall consistency of treatment effect. 
The applicant was asked to re-analyse the data in subjects without antimalarials with focus on Filgotinib 
monotherapy. The proportion of subjects that achieved the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 24 were in 
the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group 78.1% for all subjects vs 77.2% for subjects without 
antimalarials. Also in the other three treatment arms in the study, the differences in outcome between the 
overall population and subjects without antimalarials were very marginal. As for the proportion that 
achieved remission according to DAS28 at week 24, it was 42.4% for all subjects and 43.0% for subjects 
without antimalarials in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group. Also in the other three treatment 
arms, the differences in outcome between the overall population and subjects without antimalarials were 
marginal (and not better in the “all subject”-group). Similar patterns were seen also for the other 
presented endpoints. Thus, the CHMP agreed with the applicant that the results in this monotherapy first 
line study were similar for subjects without antimalarials as compared to the overall study population. 
In conclusion, a preliminary view is that the combination of Filgotinib + MTX achieved better efficacy in a 
MTX-naïve population than MTX alone from week 2 to week 24. 
The currently proposed indication includes monotherapy ≥second line. Support for monotherapy second 
line could come from DARWIN 2. However, for monotherapy ≥third line, there are no observed data and 
thus this part of the indication will instead have to rely on extrapolation. It should be noted that previously 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 93/170 
 
 
 
approved JAK-inhibitors (baricitinib and tofacitinib) that are indicated for use in monotherapy third line 
were also evaluated only as combination therapy in this setting. It is further noted that placebo-corrected 
response rates for ACR 20 and LDA appear similar for combination therapy 3rd line (FINCH 2) vs 
combination therapy 2nd line (FINCH 1). Although the limitations of inter-study comparisons are 
acknowledged, this provides some support for the extrapolation of efficacy observed with monotherapy 
2nd line to monotherapy 3rd line. Taking into account the totality of data supporting the efficacy of 
Filgotinib therapy in RA, it is considered that, in line with previous precedents, there is no absolute 
requirement for separate monotherapy data third line to approve this part of the indication. 
With regards to the observed monotherapy data, the following observations can be made:  
-Regarding monotherapy first line: Although data are somewhat limited and although none of the 
comparisons between filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy and MTX in FINCH 3 resulted in an outcome that 
was considered statistically significant, it is noted that for the primary endpoint and all three key 
secondary endpoints (which included effect on structural progression and function as well as proportion of 
subjects in remission) numerically better outcomes were noted for filgotinib monotherapy vs MTX 
monotherapy (the active comparator). However, the CHMP questioned the initially proposed 
monotherapy indication in the D120 LoQ in the light of the totality of data on JAK-inhibitors that has so far 
become available also considering that such indication has not been approved for previous members in 
the class. As a consequence, the first line indication was withdrawn by the applicant during the 
application. 
-Regarding monotherapy second line: In the phase 2 DARWIN 2-study, an effect of filgotinib 200 mg vs 
placebo was seen both for the primary and the secondary endpoints (including the proportion of subjects 
with remission/low disease activity). Although an active comparator would have been a more appropriate 
choice than placebo to better elucidate the effects of monotherapy in this MTX-IR population, the study 
included a rather limited number of patients and did not include a direct comparison between filgotinib 
monotherapy vs. filgotinib in combination, this data provides some support for monotherapy second line. 
Together with the support that can be retrieved through extrapolation from FINCH 3, data from DARWIN 
3 (that supports maintenance of effect of filgotinib monotherapy second line although only pooled data 
from this study was provided without details on the exact dose regimen in each group ), it is considered 
sufficient to support the proposed monotherapy second line indication as it is currently worded (i.e. with 
no restrictions that monotherapy second line is only indicated when combination therapy is inappropriate- 
as the available data do not indicate a major efficacy advantage for the combination vs monotherapy and 
there are instead safety disadvantages associated with the combination, see safety section 2.6. ). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the data submitted by the Applicant support the short-term 
efficacy of Filgotinib, both as monotherapy and in combination with MTX for the treatment of RA second 
and third line. Data supporting maintenance of effect up to 1 year has also been provided. 
However, the CHMP questioned the initially proposed indication “[Tradename] is indicated as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis 
who have highly active and early progressive (erosive) disease, were not previously treated with MTX, 
and for whom treatment with MTX is inappropriate” in the D120 LoQ in the light of the data submitted with 
this application, the totality of data on JAK-inhibitors that has so far become available and also 
considering that it would be the 1st in the class. The first line indication was withdrawn by the applicant 
with their responses to the D120 LoQ (see also Section 2.6.1).  
In addition, filgotinib was initially proposed to be given either in monotherapy or in combination with MTX 
or other csDMARDs. Since sufficient data supporting the combination with csDMARDs other then MTX 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020

were not presented, this was raised as a major objection in the D120 LoQ. As a consequence, the proposal 
for use in combination with csDMARDs was withdrawn by the applicant with their responses to the D120 
LoQ. 
In conclusion, the application is considered acceptable from an efficacy perspective in the revised 
indication: 
“Jyseleca is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients 
who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti 
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Jyseleca may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX ).” 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 4120 subjects with RA have received at least 1 dose of filgotinib for a total exposure of 
7218.36 patient-years of exposure (PYE) across all Phase 2 and Phase 3 RA studies. Of these, 
2928 subjects have received any dose of filgotinib for over 1 year (PYE = 6647.91).

Adverse events 
Phase 1 studies 
Filgotinib has been evaluated in Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. Adverse events of interest were 
not formally evaluated in the healthy volunteer studies. One occurrence of non-serious DVT was reported 
in a female subject following a single-dose of filgotinib in a healthy volunteer study 
(Study GS-US-417-3900).

Subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease were excluded from the clinical studies, according to the 
following exclusion criterion (that was in place for all three phase 3 studies):  
History of or current moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] 
class III or IV), or within the last 6 months, a cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, unstable arrhythmia, new or significant ECG finding at screening, or any other cardiovascular 
condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would have put the subject at risk by participation in 
the study.

Hepatitis B or C infections 
In phase 2 studies, subjects with positive serology for hepatitis B or C were excluded from participation. 
In phase 3 studies, subjects with evidence of prior exposure to hepatitis B (Hep B core antibody positive, 
surface antigen negative and Hep B DNA negative) and/or hepatitis C (Hep C antibody positive) were 
allowed to enrol. They were monitored every 3 months by hepatitis B DNA or hepatitis C RNA testing.  
Adverse events of Hepatitis B or C infections reported during the first 12 weeks of treatment for As 
Randomized Subjects were reported for 1 subject (<0.1%) in the filgotinib 200 mg group/total filgotinib 
group (Hepatitis B DNA assay positive). No subject in the filgotinib 100 mg, adalimumab, or other groups 
had an AE of hepatitis B or C infection.  
The frequency of hepatitis B-related AEs for As Treated Subjects in the Phase 3 studies (up to week 52) 
was as follows: filgotinib 200 mg: 0.4%; filgotinib 100 mg: 0.4%; adalimumab: 0.3%.

Serious adverse events 
Table 36 presents an overall summary of SAEs for As Treated Subjects in the pooled safety population.  
Table 36 Overall Summary of Serious Adverse Events in the Pooled Safety Population (Safety Analysis Set, 
As Treated Subjects) 
Pneumonia was the most common treatment-emergent SAE reported across all treatment groups for As 
Treated Subjects (filgotinib 200 mg: 13 subjects, 0.6%, filgotinib 100 mg: 7 subjects, 0.4%; 
adalimumab: 2 subjects, 0.6%; MTX monotherapy: 1 subject, 0.2%). Rheumatoid arthritis (worsening) 
was the most commonly reported SAE in the other treatment group (3 subjects, 0.3%). 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for SAEs of pneumonia was 0.4 per 100 PYE in the filgotinib 200 mg 
group, 0.5 per 100 PYE in the filgotinib 100 mg group, 0.7 per 100 PYE in the adalimumab group, and 
0.8 per 100 PYE in the MTX monotherapy group. 
Laboratory findings 
According to the applicant, the clinical laboratory safety profile in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies 
indicated that filgotinib was generally well tolerated.

Other findings relevant to safety 
Vital signs and body weight 
According to the applicant, there were no clinically relevant changes in any treatment group or differences 
between treatment groups in mean values for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, 
respiration rate, or body temperature in the Phase 3 study population. 
According to the applicant, in the Phase 1 Safety Populations, no safety signals for vital signs or physical 
findings were identified. 
ECG findings 
A thorough QT study (GS-US-417-3911) was performed. According to the ICH guideline, a negative 
thorough QT/QTc study is one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the 
largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms. For filgotinib, at all 
time-points, the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval is below 10 ms, and the criterion 
has thus been fulfilled. 
ECG findings in phase 2 and 3 studies 
In Study GLPG0634-CL-204, 1 subject in the placebo group had an abnormal ECG shift that was reported 
as an AE and led to study drug discontinuation. No additional clinically relevant shifts in ECG parameters 
were reported for subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 1 Safety Populations.

Sex 
According to the applicant, the percentage of As Treated Subjects in the Pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 
Safety Studies who experienced any AE, any SAE or any serious infection was similar for male subjects 
and female subjects across all treatment groups. 
Hepatic impairment 
A total of 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CPT] B) and 10 healthy 
matched control subjects received a single, oral dose of filgotinib 100 mg in Study GS-US-417-4048. No 
deaths, SAEs, or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. Three subjects (30.0%) with moderate 
Assessment report

hepatic impairment and 1 healthy matched control subject (10.0%) experienced AEs. All AEs were 
Grade 1 in severity. Filgotinib was, according to the applicant, generally well tolerated in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. 
The applicant stated that because exposures of filgotinib and its primary metabolite GS-829845 were not 
significantly impacted by moderate hepatic impairment, filgotinib and GS-829845 PK was not evaluated in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment. The applicant further stated that no dose adjustment is necessary 
in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment but as filgotinib has not been evaluated in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment it is not recommended for use in this patient population.  
Renal impairment 
A total of 6 subjects with mild renal impairment, 6 subjects with moderate renal impairment, 3 subjects 
with severe renal impairment, and 9 subjects with normal renal function received filgotinib 100 mg once 
daily for 10 days in Study GLPG0634-CL-106.  
No deaths, SAEs, or discontinuations due to AEs were reported among these subjects. Three subjects 
(33.3%) with normal renal function, 1 subject (16.7%) with mild renal impairment, and 1 subject 
(16.7%) with moderate renal impairment experienced AEs. All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
According to the applicant, there were no clinically significant safety-related changes on laboratory 
parameters. 
Furthermore, according to the applicant, mild renal impairment had no impact on filgotinib or GS-829845 
PK when compared to subjects with normal renal function. Moderate and severe renal impairment 
modestly increased filgotinib exposure (AUCtau) by 1.5-fold. In subjects with severe renal impairment 
the recommended dose of filgotinib is 100 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is recommended in 
subjects with mild renal impairment. In response to day 180 LoQ, the applicant presented safety data in 
patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR  30-60, Table 42).

Concomitant csDMARD 
Most As Treated Subjects in the Pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 Safety Population were taking a csDMARD 
(including MTX) on the date of their first dose of study drug in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 parent studies 
(filgotinib 200 mg: 79.8%; filgotinib 100 mg: 90.0%; total filgotinib: 86.5%; adalimumab: 100.0%; and 
other: 94.2%). Overall, the percentage of As Treated Subjects in the Pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 Safety 
Studies who experienced any AE or SAE was numerically lower for subjects who were taking filgotinib 200 
mg in monotherapy, than in combination with MTX (Table 30). 
Pregnancy, lactation and male fertility 
Pregnancy 
According to the applicant, based on findings in animals, filgotinib may cause foetal harm and is therefore 
contraindicated during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception 
during and for at least 1 week after cessation of filgotinib treatment.  
Embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated embryolethality and teratogenicity at 
exposures comparable to 200 mg filgotinib once daily dosing in humans. Visceral and skeletal 
malformations and/or variations were observed at all dose levels of filgotinib.  
Filgotinib was administered to pregnant rats at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day. Dose-related 
increases in the incidence of internal hydrocephaly, dilated ureters, and multiple vertebral anomalies 
were seen at all dose levels. At 100 mg/kg/day, an increased number of early and late resorptions were 
noted together with a decreased number of viable fetuses. In addition, fetal body weights were 
decreased. 
In rabbits, filgotinib caused visceral malformations mainly in the lungs and cardiovascular system, at a 
dose level of 60 mg/kg/day. Filgotinib caused skeletal malformations affecting the vertebral column 
region at dose levels of 25 and 60 mg/kg/day, mainly in vertebra, ribs and sternebrae. Fused sternebrae 
also occurred at 10 mg/kg/day filgotinib. Retarded skeletal ossification was evidenced at 60 mg/kg/day. 
Overall, 19 pregnancies were reported in the clinical development program for filgotinib through the data 
cutoff dates (Table 43). In clinical studies of filgotinib, male and female subjects of childbearing potential 
who engage in heterosexual intercourse must have agreed to use protocol-specified methods of 
contraception.

Lactation 
In animal studies, filgotinib was detected in the plasma of nursing rat pups likely due to the presence of 
filgotinib in milk. It is not known if filgotinib is secreted in human breast milk. According to the applicant, 
a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded and therefore filgotinib should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Male fertility 
In animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male 
reproductive organs were observed. These effects are currently being investigated in ongoing studies in 
human males (MANTA [Study GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-RAy [Study GLPG0634-CL-227]).  
Immunological events 
Not applicable for a small molecule. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
According to the applicant, filgotinib is primarily metabolized by carboxylesterase (CES)2 and CES1, and 
is not a clinically relevant inhibitor or inducer of enzymes or transporters commonly involved in drug 
interactions such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferases. 
According to the applicant, in drug interaction studies conducted with filgotinib no clinically relevant DDIs 
were observed when filgotinib was combined with the following drugs: the combined oral contraceptive 
ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, famotidine, itraconazole (P-glycoprotein [P-gp] inhibitor), metformin 
(OCT2/MATE1/MATE2K substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), omeprazole, and rifampin (P-gp 
inducer).

As Treated Subjects) 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing data available, since filgotinib is currently not approved anywhere.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
There are currently three JAK inhibitors approved for the treatment of RA; Xeljanz (tofacitinib), Olumiant 
(baricitinib) and Rinvoq (upadacitinib). The previously observed safety issues with JAK inhibitors include 
venous thromboembolism, neutropenia, infections (especially herpes zoster), lipid disorders, 
hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated muscle enzymes. There has been concern on an 
increased risk for malignancies and cardiovascular events, and long-term studies are ongoing. There has 
also been concern on an increased risk for gastrointestinal perforations, although the exact role of JAK 
inhibition is currently not clear. 
JAK inhibitors differ in their in vitro selectivity for JAK subtypes. Tofacitinib preferentially inhibits the in 
vitro activities of JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, and to a lesser extent, JAK2/JAK2, while baricitinib more 
selectively inhibits the in vitro activities of JAK1/JAK2 and TYK2 compared with JAK3. In human cellular 
assays, upadacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over 
cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2. 
The clinical development program of filgotinib included five phase 2 studies (including one long-term 
extension) and four phase 3 studies (including one long-term extension) in over 3000 adults with RA  
including MTX-naive subjects (FINCH3), those with inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR, FINCH1), and 
subjects with inadequate response or intolerance to bDMARDs (bDMARD-IR, FINCH2). For two of the 
phase 3 studies, FINCH1 and FINCH 3, interim data up to 24 weeks (October 2018) were presented in the 
original submission. Final data from the 52-week period were submitted in response to day 120 LoQ. For 
the third phase 3 study and phase 2 studies (FINCH2, DARWIN 1 and DARWIN 2), the final CSRs included 
24-week data. Pooled data are presented from the phase 2 and phase 3 studies. This pooled population 
also includes subjects in the interim CSRs from the phase 2 long-term extension study DARWIN 3.  
Subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease, subjects with a history of malignancy or gastrointestinal 
perforations, and subjects with severe impairment of renal or liver function were excluded from the 
clinical studies.

In addition, filgotinib was initially proposed to be given either in monotherapy or in combination with MTX 
or other csDMARDs. Since data supporting the combination with csDMARDs other then MTX were not 
presented, this was raised as a major objection in the D120 LoQ. As a consequence, the proposal for use 
in combination with csDMARDs was withdrawn by the applicant with their responses to the D120 LoQ. 
JAK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, and filgotinib is proposed to be contraindicated during 
pregnancy (see Section 2.3.5. ).  
The adverse drug reactions proposed for labelling were infections (including urinary tract infection, upper 
respiratory tract infection, herpes zoster and pneumonia), neutropenia, dizziness, nausea, and increased 
blood creatine phosphokinase . Warnings were proposed for infections, malignancy, live vaccines, lipid 
derangements, and venous thromboembolism. 
During the first 12 weeks (pooled data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies), adverse events were reported 
for 658/1403 (47%) of subjects treated with filgotinib 200 mg, 442/995 (44%) of subjects treated with 
filgotinib 100 mg, 130/325 (40%) of subjects treated with adalimumab and 522/1197 (44%) of subjects 
in the “other” (MTX, other csDMARD or purely placebo) arms. The most common adverse events were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, headache, hypertension, urinary tract 
infection and bronchitis. Serious adverse events were reported less frequently for both filgotinib arms 
than for adalimumab, and there were no dose-relation observed. There were two deaths in the filgotinib 
200 mg arm; 1 septic shock secondary to pneumonia on day 25, and 1 lupus cardiomyopathy on day 7. 
There was 1 death in the filgotinib 100 mg arm; a myocardial infarction on day 13.  
In pooled data from the final phase 2 and 3 studies, adverse events were observed in a similar frequency 
for filgotinib 200 mg (1771/2267 patients, 78.1%, EAIR 43.8 E/100PY) and adalimumab (239/325 
subjects, 73.5%, EAIR 82.4 E/100 PY), while the exposure-adjusted incidence rate was higher for 
adalimumab. Adverse events were less frequent for filgotinib 100 mg (1140/1647 subjects, 69.2%, EAIR 
56.1E/100 PY). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the pooled data were presented in response to day 
120 LoQ. The regimen dose 100 mg BID have been evaluated during phase 2, and the applicant was in the 
first LoQ requested to present the pooled data for this regimen in order to allow proper benefice/risk ratio 
comparison. Due to the few events, it is difficult to conclude regarding a tendency of difference in adverse 
events EAIR between 200 mg once daily and 100 mg BID arms. At this time, it seems there is no 
difference regarding safety between the 2 administration schemes; hence, the CHMP considered that the 
issue is solved. 
FINCH3 includes a direct comparison between filgotinib 200 mg in combination with MTX and filgotinib 
200 mg in monotherapy. The frequency of TEAEs was higher for filgotinib in combination with MTX 
(318/416 subjects, 76.4%) than for filgotinib in monotherapy (143/210 subjects, 68.1%) in the final 
52-week data presented in response to day 120 LoQ. Although SAEs were observed less frequently in 
combination therapy, all deaths were observed when filgotinib was given in combination with MTX. The 
additional benefit gained by combining filgotinib with MTX was discussed in response to day 120 LoQ, 
when the Applicant argued that current evidence from randomized controlled studies and observational 
studies supports that there might be long-lasting, clinically meaningful benefit of initial, aggressive 
therapy with a combination of MTX and bDMARDs or tsDMARDs versus MTX monotherapy. This was 
agreed by the CHMP.  
Adverse events of special interest included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), infections 
(including serious infections, herpes zoster, TB, opportunistic infections and hepatitis B or C infections), 
venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), malignancy and 
gastrointestinal perforations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 139/170 
 
 
 
MACE 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE was higher for the filgotinib 200 mg group than for the 
adalimumab group, but lower than for the MTX monotherapy group. The EAIR was slightly higher for 
filgotinib 100 mg than for filgotinib 200 mg and thus, no dose-relation was seen. 
In updated pooled data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies presented in response to day 120 LoQ, a total 
of 10 deaths from positively-adjudicated MACE was observed, all in filgotinib treatment groups. These 10 
deaths were due to different aetiologies including lupus myocarditis, ischemic stroke, exudative 
pericarditis, myocardial infarction and subarachnoid haemorrhage, and no clear pattern was identified. In 
addition, there was 1 death due to pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in a patient switching 
from placebo to filgotinib 200 mg.  
According to the applicant, a majority of the subjects had cardiovascular risk factor such as obesity, 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or advanced age. At the CHMP’s request, a warning on the cardiovascular 
risk was included in the Section 4.4 SmPC. 
All infections 
In pooled safety data from the final CSRs presented in response to day 120 LoQ, the frequency of 
infections was not higher for filgotinib 200 mg (26.5 E/100PY) or filgotinib 100 mg (31.9 E/100PY) than 
for adalimumab (44.5 E/100PY) or MTX (44.1 E/100PY). No dose-relation was seen, which is reassuring. 
Serious infections 
In pooled safety data from the final CSRs presented in response to day 120 LoQ, the exposure-adjusted 
incidence rate for serious infections was not higher for any filgotinib group than for adalimumab. The risk 
was numerically lower for filgotinib 200 mg than for filgotinib 100 mg.  
At the CHMP’s request, the Applicant included a contraindication for filgotinib in patients with active 
serious infections. In addition, at the CHMP’s request, more detailed description regarding infections was 
included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Pneumonia is a serious adverse event which have been proposed in section 4.8 of the draft SmPC. 
Following CHMP’s request, the applicant presented the infectious agents involved in pneumonia and 
discussed if the risk might be prevented (vaccination). The presented data included too few cases to 
conclude regarding a predominant infectious agent, and the issue was considered solved by the CHMP. At 
the CHMP’s request, a warning is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The applicant presented in response to the day 120 LoQ a review on the acute respiratory failure cases. 
The answers provided were considered satisfactory, and the applicant’s proposal of monitoring through 
routine pharmacovigilance is endorsed. 
Herpes zoster and varicella zoster 
Herpes zoster was observed more frequently in filgotinib arms than in the adalimumab and MTX arms. 
Herpes zoster is proposed to be listed as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency uncommon; 
this is supported by the CHMP.  
There were a total of 7 serious cases of herpes zoster – 5 in subjects receiving filgotinib 200 mg and 2 in 
subjects receiving filgotinib 100 mg. All 7 cases required hospitalisation. There were two cases reported 
of varicella zoster, both in the filgotinib 100 mg arm. At the CHMP’s request, a warning is included in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 140/170 
 
 
 
In addition to these cases, there was one death (FINCH1) due to varicella. This case was further discussed 
in response to day 120 LoQ, and no SmPC update was considered needed by the CHMP.  
Tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections 
There were three cases of active TB in the filgotinib 100 mg group. All subjects screened negative in the 
QuantiFERON TB-Gold In-Tube test at entry into the parent studies, indicating there were no reactivation 
of TB. At the CHMP’s request, filgotinib was contraindicated in patients with active tuberculosis and 
adequate information was included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There were 3 cases of oesophageal candidiasis reported in filgotinib groups. Mentioning oesophageal 
candidiasis in SmPC section 4.4 was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Hepatitis B or C infections 
In phase 2 studies, subjects with positive serology for hepatitis B or C were excluded from participation. 
In phase 3 studies, subjects with active HBC or HCV infection (as defined by positive HBsAg, HBV DNA or 
HCV RNA) were excluded while subjects with positive HBV core Ab and negative HBV DNA were allowed to 
participate, and were tested every 3 months for HBV DNA. At the CHMP’s request, a warning on the risk 
for viral reactivation has been added in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) 
VTE has been observed for the previously approved JAK inhibitors. In final pooled data presented in 
response to day 120 LoQ, there were 8 cases reported for filgotinib 200 mg and 1 case for filgotinib 100 
mg, compared to 1 case reported for adalimumab and 2 cases for MTX. It is noted that the EAIR for 
venous thromboembolism is not higher for filgotinib than for adalimumab or MTX. Nonetheless, at the 
CHMP’s request, a warning on the potential class effect of JAK inhibitors on the risk for venous 
thromboembolism has been added in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) 
No firm conclusions can be drawn from the data due to the limited exposure so far, although it is 
reassuring to the CHMP that the risk observed so far is not higher for filgotinib than for the comparators. 
The described malignancies include solid tumours as well as lymphomas. The risk also needs to be 
followed post-approval (see RMP –Section 2.7. ). A warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC was proposed 
which was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
Although long-term data are limited, there have been cases of NMSC described with a possible 
dose-relation. A warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC was proposed which was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Gastrointestinal perforations 
Subjects with a history of GI perforation were excluded from the phase 3 studies. Nonetheless, there were 
three cases of gastrointestinal perforation (duodenal/gastric/diverticular) in subjects treated with 200 mg 
filgotinib, as compared to no cases in the other groups. Of these, 2 were upper GI perforations and 1 was 
a lower GI perforation. There is previous concern on lower GI perforations in patients treated with 
interleukin-6 receptor antagonists and potentially with agents that have downstream effect on 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 141/170 
 
 
 
interleukin-6 signalling. Gastrointestinal perforation is included as an important potential risk in the 
filgotinib RMP (see RMP – Section 2.7. ). Based on this, the CHMP accepted not to include a warning in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC but to continue the observation of this risk post-marketing. 
Deaths 
To date, there have been 19 deaths among filgotinib 200 mg-treated subjects and 6 deaths among 
filgotinib 100 mg-treated subject (pooled phase 2 and phase 3 studies). The causes of death include 
infections, venous thromboembolism, malignancies and cardiovascular events and no specific pattern 
could be observed other than what is expected in an RA population. 
There seems to be an increased mortality for filgotinib 200 mg (19 events, 0.5 E/100 PY) than for 
filgotinibib 100 mg (6 events, 0.3 E/100 PYs), adalimumab (1 event, 0.3 E/100PY) and MTX monotherapy 
(0 events), although the comparison is hampered by the different exposure to the drugs. When compared 
to other RA clinical trial programs, the EAIR for death for filgotinib is comparable to the other  approved 
JAK inhibitors, although limitations of inter-study comparisons are acknowledged. 
The causes of death are expected given the known safety problems with JAK inhibitors; infections 
including meningitis, venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease. There were 6 cases of 
malignancies. The follow-up time is too short for firm conclusions with regards to malignancy; however, 
these cases occurred after quite long treatment (minimum 214 days).  
There were two cases of death due to interstitial lung disease. The applicant presented further 
information on these cases in response to day 120 LoQ. Since causality could not be considered 
established, no SmPC update was considered needed by the CHMP. 
In the final CSR from FINCH1, with a direct comparison between filgotinib and adalimumab on top of MTX, 
there were 3 deaths/475 subjects for filgotinib 200 mg (0.6%, these were 2 cases of septic shock due to 
pneumonia and 1 case of alveolitis and respiratory failure), 1/480 (0.2%, this was a myocardial 
infarction) for filgotinib 100 mg and 1/325 (0.3%, sepsis) for adalimumab. There was one additional 
death for filgotinib 200 mg (+MTX) in a subject who switched from placebo; a case of ischemic stroke, 
DVT and pulmonary embolism on day 224 (switched after 24 weeks, approx. day 168). The comparison 
between filgotinib and adalimumab (on top of MTX) is highly clinically relevant. Although the numbers are 
small there seems to be a numerical difference with an increased incidence of death for filgotinib 200 mg 
in combination with csDMARDs, compared to the 100 mg dose and to adalimumab. Even if the absolute 
risk is small, the relative risk is doubled compared to the 100 mg dose. Therefore, the applicant was asked 
to discuss the strength of the evidence supporting this imbalance in mortality and to justify that the 
benefits of the 200 mg dose outweigh the increased risk. In this context, the Applicant was asked to 
discuss which implications an increased risk of mortality might have post-approval when filgotinib may be 
used in a wider population than the population included in the clinical development programme (where for 
example patients at high cardiovascular risk were excluded). 
In response to this major objection, the applicant discussed the numerical difference in mortality for the 
filgotinib 200 mg dose compared to the 100 mg dose and to adalimumab. With regards to the observed 
mortality difference between filgotinib (0.5 E per 100 PYE) and adalimumab (0.3 E per 100 PYE), the 
CHMP agreed with the applicant that the exposure to adalimumab in filgotinib clinical studies is low and 
that this influences the ability to achieve an accurate estimate of mortality rates. 
As stated by the applicant, the main causes of death among patients with RA are CVD, infection, 
respiratory disease, and cancer. In the presented data, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates for deaths 
due to CV, and serious infections were similar across all treatment group. A numerically higher rate of 
mortality due to malignancies were observed for filgotinib 200 mg (6 cases, 0.1E/100PYE) compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 142/170 
 
 
 
other treatments (OE). The 6 on-study reported deaths due to malignancies were diverse, including 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous cell carcinoma of the 
esophagus, ovarian cancer, and unknown primary. The applicant states that two additional deaths, one in 
the placebo group (fatal malignant glioma) and one in the MTX group (small cell lung cancer), were 
reported after the subjects had left the study. When looking at all cases of malignancies (excluding 
non-melanoma skin cancer), there is no dose-dependency observed. Similarly, no dose-dependence is 
observed for the AESIs of serious infectious AEs or MACE which is reassuring. 
The applicant has also discussed potential implications when filgotinib may be used in a wider population 
than was enrolled in clinical trials. The filgotinib RA clinical program excluded subjects with uncontrolled 
heart failure (New York Heart Association class 3 or 4), cerebrovascular accident, or myocardial infarction 
within the last 6 months before screening. However, these exclusion criteria have been used in most RA 
clinical trials. According to the applicant, extrapolating clinical trial findings to a wider RA population is 
challenging given the multifaceted nature of the disease, disease heterogenicity, and the interplay of 
disease activity and DMARDs on safety outcomes in RA. Usually clinical trial subjects have higher disease 
activity than the common RA population, and a lower mortality rate might be expected in the overall RA 
population. However, any potential for a lower mortality rate might be offset by the advanced age in the 
wider RA population. The risk of filgotinib in a wider RA population will be evaluated post-marketing. 
Meanwhile, the CHMP considered that the applicant has adequately minimized the risk through warnings 
and precautions in the SmPC. 
Finally, the applicant has presented a benefit-risk discussion for the filgotinib 200 mg dose. From the 
presented data, the CHMP agreed that additional benefit of filgotinib is observed at the 200 mg dose over 
the 100 mg dose. There is a small numerical difference in mortality point estimates; however, the 
relevance of this observation is difficult to assess taken into account that overall the differences between 
all the analyzed treatment groups are small with overlapping 95% CIs and that there are no 
dose-dependency observed for the most important AESIs of serious infections, MACE or malignancy. In 
conclusion, the CHMP considered that the data supports the approval of the 200 mg-dose. 
Laboratory findings 
In pooled data from phase 2 and 3 studies, the proportion of subjects with grade 3 anaemia was similar 
in the filgotinib and adalimumab group, and higher in the “other” arm (placebo ± MTX or csDMARDs, and 
MTX monotherapy) during the first 12 weeks. The Hb levels seem to increase over time, probably 
reflecting a decreased inflammatory burden. 
Decreased lymphocytes, total leukocytes and neutrophils was observed more frequently in 
filgotinib-treated subjects than in other groups. Neutropenia is proposed to be listed as an ADR in section 
4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency uncommon which is acceptable. At the CHMP’s request, monitoring 
recommendation has been added to section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Lipids 
A dose-dependent increase in total cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed for filgotinib (pooled data 
from phase 2 and 3). Information is included in the SmPC in sections 4.2, 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC, which 
is acceptable to CHMP.  
Renal and liver parameters 
Increases in serum creatinine was very rare, and creatinine levels remained stable over time.

During the first 12 weeks, ALAT elevations were less common in the filgotinib group than in the 
adalimumab group, and ASAT elevation were comparable between the groups. Grade 3 increases in 
ASAT/ALAT were balanced between the groups, but one subject in the filgotinib 200 mg group had a grade 
4 increase in ASAT/ALAT compared to none in the comparator groups. Details on this case was presented 
in response to day 120 LoQ, but due to confounding factors and lack of information, causality with 
filgotinib was not considered established. The CHMP agreed with the applicant that treatment with 
filgotinib does not confer an increased risk for elevated liver enzymes than the comparators 
adalimumab+MTX or MTX. Hence, no SmPC update was considered needed. 
The applicant was asked to review the cases of acute kidney injury and Cholelithiasis and discuss if they 
constitute signals and should be added to SmPC. The applicant considered that the cases involved 
subjects with risk factors for cholelithiasis condition (such as being female and age ≥ 40 years). This risk 
factors are also associated with higher prevalence of RA and cholelithiasis are not retrieved with 
methotrexate. The applicant was also asked to discuss if there is a pharmacologic mechanism which may 
explain the greater occurrence of cholelithiasis in filgotinib groups compared to methotrexate, and also 
present and discuss the time to onset of cholelithiasis in filgotinib and placebo arms. Due to few cases 
during the analysis period. Based on the data submitted, the CHMP agreed that it is not possible to 
conclude that filgotinib had a role in the occurrence of cholelithiasis. This is was therefore considered 
solved. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The percentage of subjects in the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 safety studies who experienced any AE, SAE 
and serious infection was numerically higher in subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared with subjects 
< 65 years of age, in the filgotinib 200 mg group.  
For patients treated with MTX monotherapy group, the EAIR of TEAE, TE serious AE, Infectious AE, 
Serious Infectious AE were not higher for subjects≥ 75 years of age as compared to subjects<75 years of 
age. For the filgotinib 200 mg +/-csDMARD all these EAIRs were higher for subjects≥ 75 years compared 
to subjects<75 years while the pattern was less distinct for the lower filgotinib dose group. For 
adalimumab, most of these EAIRs were higher in the oldest group. Thus, the effect of age on safety 
appears more prominent for the higher filgotinib dose as compared to MTX monotherapy and also, to 
some extent, compared to the lower filgotinib dose. All the three JAK—inhibitors previously approved for 
the RA-indication includes SmPC-wordings aimed to mitigate the risks in the elderly population. Since 
both the 100 mg and 200 mg doses of filgotinib have been demonstrated to be effective, the benefits of 
recommending the 200 mg dose to all elderly patients are not considered to outweigh the risks. 
Therefore, a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended for patients aged 75 or above (See also clinical 
pharmacology section 2.4. ). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Filgotinib  is  primarily  excreted  in  urine.  Mild  renal  impairment  had  no  impact  on  filgotinib  PK  when 
compared  to  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  Moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  modestly 
increased filgotinib exposure (AUCtau) by 1.5-fold. No dose adjustment is necessary in subjects with mild 
or  moderate  renal  impairment.  In  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  the  recommended  dose  of 
filgotinib  is  100  mg.  In  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment,  a  1.96  fold  increase  of  AUCeff  is 
observed  Therefore,  a  lower  dose  of  100  mg  is  recommended  for  patients  with  moderate  renal 
impairment (See also clinical pharmacology section 2.4. ). 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 144/170 
 
 
 
Exposures of filgotinib were not significantly impacted by moderate hepatic impairment, and was not 
evaluated in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is necessary in subjects with 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Filgotinib has not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment and is therefore not recommended for use in this patient population. This is adequately 
reflected in Section 4.2 of the SmPC (See also clinical pharmacology section 2.4). At the CHMP’s request, 
the need for a contraindication was discussed and this was not considered needed because filgotinib is not 
primarily hepatically excreted and because there is no obvious effect on hepatic transaminases.  
Concomitant csDMARDs and other drugs 
As mentioned previously, data supporting the combination with csDMARDs other then MTX have not been 
presented. Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the indication was revised by the applicant to include only 
monotherapy or combination with MTX. 
The applicant was in the first round invited to discuss potential interactions of filgotinib with other drugs, 
such as pivalate antibiotics and valproate, whose metabolic pathways also involve carnitine conjugation 
which may lead to secondary carnitine deficiency, but no such safety issue was found. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Filgotinib is proposed to be contraindicated during pregnancy and should not be used during 
breast-feeding. This is adequately reflected in Sections 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC.  
Although contraception was required during the clinical studies, it is noted that there were several 
pregnancies observed during the studies. In 6 of 19 pregnancies, a protocol-specified method was 
correctly used. The reason for this lack of efficacy is not entirely clear, since there are no expected drug 
interactions between filgotinib and oral contraceptives. At the CHMP’s request, the Applicant discussed 
the reasons why contraception was not effective during the clinical studies, and whether this should 
warrant any further information in the SmPC, such as preferred contraceptive method. In view of the 
answers provided by the applicant and the information on pregnancy and contraception provided in the 
health care professionals brochure and patient card, the issue was considered solved. Section 4.6 of the 
SmPC recommends that “Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and 
for at least 1 week after cessation of filgotinib treatment.” 
Male fertility 
In animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male 
reproductive organs were observed (see non-clinical Section 2.3). These effects are currently being 
investigated in ongoing studies in human males (MANTA [Study GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-RAy 
[Study GLPG0634-CL-227]). The clinical consequences of these findings are currently uncertain. At the 
CHMP’s request, the applicant presented blinded interim data from the MANTA study. The applicant has 
also reported results of hormone levels from phase 2 studies, in which there were no clinically relevant 
changes in sex hormone levels. The CHMP agrees with the applicant that current data suggest there is no 
clinically relevant effect of filgotinib on male reproductive hormones, including testosterone, FSH, LH, and 
inhibin B.  
Interim data from the MANTA and MANTA-Ray studies will be submitted in first half of 2021. The findings 
in pre-clinical studies are of great concern and has not been seen for other JAK inhibitors. No mechanistic 
explanation has been identified, and thus there is a potential risk for humans. At the CHMP’s request, a 
warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and information on this risk in the proposed educational 
material.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The major safety concern given the immunosuppressive effect of filgotinib is the risk for infections. The 
most commonly reported infections were mild (for example upper respiratory tract infections, 
nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infection), although also severe infections and deaths due to infections 
occurred. Filgotinib is contraindicated in active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections. Adequate 
warnings are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There is concern on an increased risk for venous thromboembolism for all agents in the JAK class. This is 
adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
There is currently limited long-term data on the safety profile of filgotinib. Up to current cut-off, the 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate of death is higher for filgotinib 200 mg than for the comparator 
adalimumab, although the actual numbers are small. The relevance of this observation is difficult to 
assess taken into account that overall the differences between all the analysed treatment groups are 
small with overlapping 95% CIs and that there are no dose-dependency observed for the most important 
AESIs of serious infections, MACE or malignancy. The CHMP considered that those uncertainties would 
need to be followed-up post approval but were sufficiently addressed in the SmPC and the RMP. 
The clinical consequences of pre-clinical findings on substantial decrease of fertility, impaired 
spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs are unclear. These 
unexpected findings were observed already from 4 weeks of treatment and with low marginals and only 
partial recovery. The clinical consequences of these findings are being investigated in ongoing studies in 
human males (MANTA [Study GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-RAy [Study GLPG0634-CL-227]). At the 
CHMP’s request, the applicant has included warnings in the SmPC section 4.4, the package leaflet (PL) 
and in the educational material regarding the risk for infertility in male patients treated with filgotinib, 
aiming to limit the use of filgotinib to female patients and male patients without intent of fathering a child. 
This was considered acceptable to the CHMP until the results of the MANTA studies are available (1H21). 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the safety profile of filgotinib was acceptable in view of the 
information included in the SmPC and RMP.

in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of filgotinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers filgotinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
statutory information via mobile scanning and other technologies has been submitted by the applicant 
and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code:  
• 
• 
Package leaflet 
Educational material for patients as outlined in the Risk Management Plan 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Jyseleca (filgotinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially proposed indication for this new JAK-inhibitor was: 
“Jyseleca is indicated as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional 
synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are 
intolerant to, one or more DMARDs.  
Jyseleca is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely 
active rheumatoid arthritis who have highly active and early progressive (erosive) disease, were not 
previously treated with MTX, and for whom treatment with MTX is inappropriate.” 
RA treatment should, according to relevant European recommendations (EULAR), generally be aimed at 
reaching a target of sustained low disease activity. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Methotrexate (MTX) should, according to relevant European recommendations (EULAR), be the first 
treatment strategy for RA. In patients with contraindications to MTX (or early intolerance), leflunomide or 
sulfalazine should be considered as the (first) line treatment strategy. If there is no improvement by at 
most 3 months after start of treatment or the target has not been reached by 6 months, therapy should 
be adjusted. Depending on whether poor prognostic factors are present or not, other csDMARD or 
addition of a bDMARD (biologic DMARD) or tsDMARD (targeted synthetic DMARD) could then be 
considered. JAK-inhibitors are tsDMARD.  
Despite the recent advances in this therapeutic field, there all still patients who either cannot tolerate or 
do not respond to the available treatment options i.e. there is still an unmet need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development programme includes 4 Phase 2 studies in an MTX-IR population+ a long-term 
extension study and 3 pivotal phase III studies in MTX-IR, bDMARD-IR and MTX-naïve patients+ a 
long-term extension. The studies cover different aspects of the proposed indication and posology. 
Phase II studies 
Two completed, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week Phase 2a studies; 
GLPG0634-CL-201 (n=36, randomized) and GLPG0634-CL-202 (n=91, randomized), explored once or 
twice daily filgotinib doses up to a total daily dose of 200 mg or 300 mg on top of MTX, respectively. Doses 
above 200 mg daily were not pursued in Phase 2b because an exposure-response analysis was considered 
to have demonstrated that responses were at plateau with the 200-mg daily dose.  
The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b studies GLPG0634-CL-203; DARWIN 1 
(n=594, randomized and treated) and GLPG0634-CL-204; DARWIN 2 (n= 283, randomized and treated) 
included subjects exposed at 3 different daily doses of GLPG0634 i.e. filgotinib (i.e., 50, 100, and 200 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 154/170 
 
 
 
daily) at 2 dose regimens (once and twice daily administration). Both studies; the first MTX-add on, the 
second monotherapy, were conducted in the MTX-IR population and were randomized, double-blind and 
placebo-controlled, with ACR 20 at week 12 being the primary endpoint and an NRI-approach. The 
designs of the phase IIb dose-finding studies, including the selection of the primary endpoint, are 
generally considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Regarding DARWIN 2, it is noted that although this was considered as a monotherapy study, antimalarial 
DMARDs were included among the permitted medications.  
Phase III studies 
FINCH 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled MTX-add on study in which 1755 
subjects from a second line population (active RA despite MTX-treatment) with poor prognostic factors 
were randomized and treated with either Filgotinib 100 mgx1, Filgotinib 200 mgx1, the TNF-inhibitor 
adalimumab or placebo. There was a rescue-possibility (to SOC) at week 14. In addition to MTX, 
concomitant anti-malarial csDMARDs were allowed but no other csDMARDs.  
FINCH 2 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, csDMARD-add on study in which 448 subjects 
from a third line population (failed or intolerant to at least 1 bDMARD) were randomized and treated with 
either Filgotinib 100 mgx1, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 or placebo with a rescue-possibility (to SOC) at week 14. 
Concomitant csDMARDs included MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and leflunomide.  
FINCH 3 is randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in which 1249 subjects from a first line 
population (limited or no prior treatment with MTX) with at least one poor prognostic factor were 
randomized and treated with either Filgotinib 100 mgx1+MTX, Filgotinib 200 mgx1+MTX, Filgotinib 200 
mgx1 monotherapy or MTX monotherapy with a rescue-possibility (to SOC) at week 24. Antimalarials are 
included among the permitted concomitant medications and thus the treatment arm referred to as the 
Filgotinib monotherapy arm is not a monotherapy arm in the strictest sense. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Short term favourable effects-data up to week 24  
Short term favourable effects supporting the different parts of the proposed indication were provided and 
are summarized under the different headings below. An effect vs placebo was seen across populations 
although response rates were lower the more treatment-experienced the patients were. 
Effects in MTX-IR for combination with MTX  
In DARWIN 1, the outcome of the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 12, was: 44.2% in the 
placebo group (+MTX),  56.1% in Filgotinib 50 mgx1+MTX group, 63.5% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1+MTX 
group, 68.6% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1+MTX, 57.0% in the Filgotinib 25 mgx1+MTX group, 60.0% in 
the Filgotinib 50 mgx2+MTX group and 78.6% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx2 +MTX group (p-values<0.05 for 
the comparison vs placebo for the 100 mgx1, 200 mgx1 and 100 mgx2 groups). Dose-dependent 
responses were observed in the majority of these secondary efficacy parameters including proportion of 
subjects achieving remission/LDA. 
In FINCH 1, all superiority or noninferiority tests of filgotinib versus comparator in the hierarchical testing 
demonstrated a statistically significant superiority or noninferiority of filgotinib over the comparator (p < 
0.001), with the exception of the final noninferiority test of the percentages of subjects who achieved 
DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 (filgotinib 100 mg vs adalimumab; p = 0.054). 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 155/170 
 
 
 
For the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 12, the proportion of responders were 76.6% in the Filgotinib 
200 mgx1 (+MTX) group, 69.8% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1(+MTX) group, 70.8% in the Adalimumab (+ 
MTX) group and 49.9% in the placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between 
the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group).  
For the key secondary endpoint LDA (defined as DAS28 (CRP)≤3.2) at week 12, the proportion of 
responders were 49.7% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1(+MTX) group, 38.8% in the Filgotinib 100 
mgx1(+MTX) group, 43.4% in the adalimumab (+ MTX) group and 23.4% in the placebo (+ MTX) group 
(p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group) and for 
the non-inferiority comparison of Filgotinib 200 mg group vs the adalimumab group). Non-inferiority of 
Filgotinib 200 mg vs adalimumab for DAS28(CRP) <= 3.2 at Week 12 was confirmed also in the 
Per-Protocol analysis. 
For the key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects who achieve Remission defined as DAS28 
(CRP)<2.6 at Week 24, the proportion of responders were 48.4% in the Filgotinib 200 mg (+ MTX) group, 
35.2% in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+ MTX) group, 35.7% in the Adalimumab (+ MTX) group and 16.2% in 
the placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 for both superiority comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and 
the placebo group). 
For the key secondary endpoint, change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 24, the mean (SD) was 0.13 
(0.937) in the Filgotinib 200 mg (+ MTX) group, 0.17 (0.905) in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+ MTX) group, 
0.16 (0.948) in the Adalimumab group (+ MTX) and 0.38 (1.408) in the Placebo (+ MTX) group (p<0.001 
for both superiority comparisons between the Filgotinib groups and the placebo group). 
Numerically better outcomes were reported for both doses of Filgotinib compared to placebo for the 
CRP-independent outcome CDAI. 
Regarding longer time efficacy, at week 24, the number of ACR 20 responders in absolute numbers 
increased vs week 12 in all groups but in particular in the placebo group. This was true also for the 
numbers of subjects that achieved DAS28 (CRP) <2.6 and DAS28 (CRP) <= 3.2 at week 12 vs week 24. 
Effects in MTX/csDMARD-IR for monotherapy  
In DARWIN 2, the outcome of the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 12, was: 29.2% in the 
placebo group, 66.7% in the Filgotinib 50 mgx1 group, 65.7% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1 group and 
72.5% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 group (p<0.0001 for all comparisons vs placebo).  The outcome for the 
secondary endpoint DAS28 (CRP) Remission or LDA at Weeks 12 (NRI [ITT Population]) was as follows at 
week 12: 13.9% in the placebo group, 23.6% in the Filgotinib 50 mgx1 group, 27.1% in the Filgotinib 100 
mgx1 group and 44.9% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 group (p-value<0.05 for the comparison of the 200 mg 
group vs placebo). At week 24 the proportion with DAS28 (CRP) Remission or LDA was 34.7% in the 
Filgotinib 50 mgx1 group, 50.0% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1 group and 42.0% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 
group. 
The overall results were not changed when subjects taking antimalarials were excluded from the analysis. 
Effects in bDMARD-IR for combination with csDMARD  
In FINCH 2, Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csDMARD) or 100 mgx1 (+ csDMARD) showed superiority over 
placebo (+csDMARD) for the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints.  
The proportion that attained the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at week 12, was 66.0% in the Filgotinib 200 
mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 57.5% in the Filgotinib 100 mg (+csDMARD) group and 31.1% in the placebo 
(+csDMARD) group (p<0.001 for both the comparison between the Filgotinib groups and placebo). 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 156/170 
 
 
 
For the key secondary endpoint, proportion of subjects who achieved LDA defined as DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 at 
Week 12, it was 40.8% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 37.3% in the Filgotinib 100 mgx1 
(+csDMARD) group and 15.5% in the placebo (+csDMARD) group (p < 0.001 for both comparisons with 
placebo). 
Differences vs placebo was seen for both doses with regards to the CRP-independent measure CDAI.   
Numerically better improvements were seen Filgotinib vs placebo for primary and key secondary 
endpoints from week 2-4 through week 24. 
Effects in MTX-naïve for combination with MTX and monotherapy  
In FINCH 3, for the primary endpoint the superiority of filgotinib 200 mg + MTX over MTX monotherapy 
on the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was formally demonstrated. Moreover, Filgotinib 200 mg + MTX 
and Filgotinib 100 mg + MTX demonstrated superiority over MTX monotherapy for ACR20, HAQ-DI, and 
DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 at Week 24.  
For the primary endpoint, ACR 20 response at week 24, this was reached by 81.0% in the Filgotinib 200 
mgx1+MTX group, 80.2% in the Filgotinib 100 mg x1+MTX group, 78.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 
monotherapy group and 71.4% in the MTX monotherapy group (p<0.05 for the two comparisons between 
Filgotinib combination therapy vs MTX). The results were not substantially changed when subjects taking 
antimalarials were excluded from the analysis. 
For the key secondary endpoint proportion with DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 i.e. Remission at Week 24, this was 
achieved by 54.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 1x1 + MTX group, 42.5%, in the Filgotinib 100 mg 1x1+MTX, 
42.4% in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 29.1% in the MTX monotherapy group (p < 0.001 
for the comparisons with the two Filgotinib combination groups and MTX monotherapy group 
respectively). 
For the key secondary endpoint change from baseline in the mTSS at Week 24, the mean (SD) was 0.20 
(1.682) in the Filgotinib 200 mg group, 0.22 (1.530) in the Filgotinib 100 mg group, -0.04 (1.710) in the 
Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 0.52 (2.892) in the MTX monotherapy group. 
Mean improvement from baseline to week 24 in the CRP-independent measure CDAI was numerically 
higher for each filgotinib group versus MTX monotherapy.  
Numerically greater ACR20 response rates versus MTX monotherapy were seen from Week 2 for the 
Filgotinib groups and through Week 24. This was observed also for the proportion of subjects in remission 
(DAS28 CRP<2.6). 
Long-term favourable effects 
Effect in MTX/csDMARD-IR for combination with MTX and monotherapy  
From the week 156- interim CSR of DARWIN 3, the long term follow-up that included MTX/csDMARD-IR 
subjects that received filgotinib monotherapy (n = 242, rolled over from parent phase II study DARWIN 
2) or Filgotinib with MTX (n = 497, rolled over from parent phase II study DARWIN 1), there are 
indications that the treatment effect of filgotinib ( as monotherapy or in combination with MTX) is 
maintained for up to 3 years in patients. It is noted that 229/491 MTX-IR subjects in the MTX + Filgotinib 
group had low disease activity at baseline and 200/290 subjects had Low disease activity at week 156. For 
the monotherapy group, the numbers were 97/234 and 88/136. 
In response to the Day 120 LoQ, the final CSR for FINCH 1 with week 52-data was provided. The absolute 
number of responders in the Filgotinib 200 mg-group increased from week 12 to week 24 and did not

Page 157/170 
 
 
 
decrease from week 24 to week 52. For the Filgotinib 100 mg group and the adalimumab group, a similar 
pattern was seen. The ACR 20 response increased among placebo subjects that had been reassigned to 
receive Filgotinib (at Week 24). For LDA, the absolute number of responders increased in all treatment 
groups through week 12-24-52. Also with regards to remission, the absolute number of subjects 
increased from week 24 to week 52 in all three active treatment groups. 
In response to the RSI, radiological measurements up to week 52 were provided and are reflected in the 
product information.  
Effects in MTX-naïve for combination with MTX and monotherapy 
In response to the Day 120 LoQ, the final CSR for FINCH 3 with week 52-data was provided. In all four 
treatment groups there was a slight decrease in the absolute number of ACR 20 responders from week 24 
to week 52. In the Filgotinib + MTX arms, the absolute number in remission were essentially the same 
week 24 and week 52 while it increased somewhat from week 24 to week 52 in the Filgotinib mono-arm 
and the MTX arm.  
In response to the RSI, radiological measurements up to week 52 were provided. At Week 52, a 
numerically greater proportion of subjects in the filgotinib 200 mg + MTX group had no radiographic 
progression compared with the MTX monotherapy group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The CHMP questioned the initially proposed indication “[Tradename] is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have highly active 
and early progressive (erosive) disease, were not previously treated with MTX, and for whom treatment 
with MTX is inappropriate” in the D120 LoQ in the light of the data submitted with this application, the 
totality of data on JAK-inhibitors that has so far become available and also considering that it would be the 
1st in the class. The first line indication was withdrawn by the applicant with their responses to the D120 
LoQ. 
In addition, filgotinib was initially proposed to be given either in monotherapy or in combination with MTX 
or other csDMARDs. Since sufficient data supporting the combination with csDMARDs other then MTX 
were not presented, this was raised as a major objection in the D120 LoQ. As a consequence, the proposal 
for use in combination with csDMARDs was withdrawn by the applicant with their responses to the D120 
LoQ. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The major safety concern given the immunosuppressive effect of filgotinib is the risk for infections. During 
the first 12 weeks, the overall rate of infectious adverse events was 16.7% for filgotinib 200 mg, 15.3% 
for filgotinib 100 mg, 18.5% for adalimumab and 14.2% for MTX/csDMARDs/placebo group. The most 
commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis and urinary tract 
infection. During the same period, the rate of serious infections was 0.6% for filgotinib 200 mg, 0.8% for 
filgotinib 100 mg, 1.5% for adalimumab and 0.5% for MTX/csDMARDs/placebo group. In long-term data 
(up to 52 weeks), the incidence rate of infectious AEs was 26.5 E/100 PY for filgotinib 200 mg, 31.9 
E/100PY for filgotinib 100 mg, 44.5 E/100PY for adalimumab and 44.1 E/100PY for MTX. Filgotinib is 
contraindicated in active serious infections. Adequate warnings are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Herpes zoster has been observed for other products in the class. The incidence rate for herpes zoster was 
1.8 E/100PY for filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1 E/100PY for filgotinib 100 mg, 0.7 E/100 PY for adalimumab and 
1.1 E/100PY for MTX. There were a total of 7 serious cases of herpes zoster – 5 in subjects receiving 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 158/170 
 
 
 
filgotinib 200 mg and 2 in subjects receiving filgotinib 100 mg.. Adequate warnings are included in Section 
4.4 of the SmPC. 
There were three cases of active tuberculosis in the filgotinib 100 mg group. According to the applicant, 
there were no cases of reactivation of latent TB. Filgotinib is contraindicated in Active tuberculosis (TB) or 
active serious infections. Adequate warnings are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There is concern on an increased risk for venous thromboembolism for other JAK inhibitors. The incidence 
rate of VTE was 0.2 E/100PY for filgotinib 200 mg, 0 E/100PY for filgotinib 100 mg, 0.3 E/100 PY for 
adalimumab and 0.6 E/100PY for MTX. There have been two cases of death due to VTE in 
filgotinib-treated subjects. Adequate warnings are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Gastrointestinal perforations have been observed for JAK inhibitors, including also filgotinib. Currently, 
there have been three cases of gastrointestinal (gastric/duodenal/diverticular) perforation in the filgotinib 
200 mg group, as compared to no cases in the other groups. The CHMP considered that the data didn’t 
warrant the inclusion of a warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC but this risk will be carefully followed-up 
post-marketing. 
With regards to laboratory derangements, filgotinib is associated with a decrease in neutrophil counts. 
Increases of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels have been observed, while LDL/HDL ratios 
remained unchanged. Increases in creatinine kinas were more frequent for filgotinib than for the 
comparators. At the CHMP’s request, monitoring recommendation has been added to section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
JAK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, and filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Important uncertainties relate to unfavourable effects of long latency and low frequency. Potential 
long-term unfavourable effects include: 
Malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer): In the final data in phase 2/3 studies, there have 
been 22 cases of malignancies in filgotinib 200 mg-treated subjects and 11 cases in filgotinib 100 
mg-treated subjects. The incidence rate of malignancies was 0.5 E/100PY for both filgotinib 200 mg and 
100 mg, 0.7 E/100 PY for adalimumab and 1.1 E/100PY for MTX. The described malignancies include solid 
tumours as well as lymphomas. Adequate warnings are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC and 
long-term data that will be provided post approval will be important to better assess this risk. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events: Subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease were excluded from 
the phase 3 studies. In the updated data up to week 52 in phase 2/3 studies, the incidence rate of MACE 
was 0.5 E/100PY for filgotinib 200 mg, 0.6 E/100PY for filgotinib 100 mg, 0.3 E/100 PY for adalimumab 
and 0.6 E/100PY for MTX. Adequate warnings are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC and long-term data 
that will be provided post approval will be important to better assess this risk. 
In animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male 
reproductive organs were observed. These effects are currently being investigated in ongoing studies in 
human males (MANTA [Study GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-RAy [Study GLPG0634-CL-227]). The 
knowledge on the clinical consequences of these findings are currently very limited. Adequate warnings 
are included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the educational material regarding the risk for infertility in 
male patients treated with filgotinib, aiming to limit the use of filgotinib to female patients and male 
patients without intent of fathering a child. 
There are limited data in patients over 75 years of age and in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
In the available data, an increased risk for serious AEs is observed for the 200 mg compared to the 100 
Assessment report

mg dose. Therefore, a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended to patients aged 75 or above. In patients 
with moderate renal impairment, a 1.96-fold increase of AUCeff is observed. Therefore, as for patients 
with severe renal impairment, a dose of 100 mg is recommended to patients with moderate renal 
impairment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The different favourable effects of filgotinib (overall response measured by ACR 20, achieving disease 
target state, prevention of structural damage) across the populations targeted by the proposed 
indication, is provided under the headings below.  
Short term favourable effects- Data up to week 24 
Overall clinical response measured by ACR 20 
ACR 20 response at week 12/24 was the primary endpoint in all phase IIb and phase III studies in the 
Filgotinib development programme. ACR 20 response is no longer the endpoint of choice according to 
current RA EMA guidelines and not consistent with current RA treat to target-policies as underlined in 
current RA EULAR recommendations. However, it is still of some value that across the studies and 
populations, clear differences that are considered as clinically relevant were observed between Filgotinib 
groups (that included both monotherapy and combination therapy) and placebo/MTX monotherapy 
groups regarding this endpoint. As expected, rates were lower the more treatment-experienced the 
patients were. 
Reaching target disease state 
Regarding the outcomes of the more important endpoints reflecting a target disease state, that were 
recommended in the CHMP Scientific Advice as well as in current EMA guideline, these also appear to 
support the efficacy of Filgotinib across studies and populations:  
Effects in MTX-IR for combination with MTX: In FINCH 1, almost half of the subjects that were treated with 
Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+MTX) achieved low disease activity; LDA, at week 12 compared to approximately 
¼ of the subjects in the control arm that received placebo (+MTX). The difference is considered both 
clinically and statistically significant. The proportion of subjects reaching LDA was lower in the 100 mg 
arm than the 200 mg arm but still clearly higher than in the placebo arm. In the group that received the 
active comparator adalimumab (+MTX), the proportion of subjects that achieved LDA was somewhat 
numerically lower than in the Filgotinib 200 mg (+MTX) group but higher than in the Filgotinib 100 mg 
(+MTX) group. The non-inferiority of Filgotinib 200 mg (+MTX) vs adalimumab (+MTX) was confirmed 
both in the primary analysis and the peer protocol analysis. This is considered important given that 
adalimumab would be an appropriate treatment alternative to JAK-inhibitors in clinical practice. 
Effects in MTX/csDMARD-IR for monotherapy: In DARWIN 2, the outcome for DAS28 (CRP) Remission or 
LDA at Weeks 12 was 13.9% in the placebo group, and 44.9% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 group. The 
difference between the groups appears both of a clinically relevant magnitude and statistically significant. 
The proportion reaching Remission or LDA was lower in the 100 mg group than the 200 mg group but 
again still clearly higher than in the placebo group. 
Effects in bDMARD-IR for combination with csDMARD: In FINCH 2, the proportion of subjects who 
achieved LDA at Week 12 was 40.8% in the Filgotinib 200 mgx1 (+csDMARD) group, 37.3% in the 
Filgotinib 100 mgx1 (+csDMARD) group and 15.5% in the placebo (+csDMARD) group. The difference vs 
placebo was, for both tested doses of Filgotinib, of a clinically relevant magnitude and also statistically 
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 164/170 
 
 
 
 
 
significant. That approximately 2/5 patients that do not respond to bDMARD do indeed respond to 
Filgotinib is an important finding given that this is a group of patients for which the number of alternative 
future treatment options are rather limited. 
Effects in MTX-naïve for combination with MTX and monotherapy: In FINCH 3, Remission at Week 24, was 
achieved by 54.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg 1x1 + MTX group, 42.5%, in the Filgotinib 100 mg 1x1+MTX, 
42.4% in the Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy group and 29.1% in the MTX monotherapy group. For both 
Filgotinib groups the difference vs MTX monotherapy was considered statistically significant and also 
clinically relevant. However, the comparison between Filgotinib monotherapy and MTX monotherapy as 
well as the comparison between Filgotinib monotherapy and combination therapy could be considered of 
even more clinical importance. Filgotinib monotherapy was numerically better than MTX monotherapy 
although the difference was not considered statistically significant. Similarly, the Filgotinib combination 
with MTX was numerically better than Filgotinib monotherapy. 
Prevention of structural damage 
Regarding prevention of structural damage, in the MTX-IR population in FINCH 1, in the comparison of 
mean change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 24 on top of MTX, both Filgotinib doses were statistically 
superior to placebo. Compared to adalimumab (comparison not included in the hierarchical statistical 
testing procedure), Filgotinib (in both doses) appeared to have a similar capability of preventing 
structural damage.   
In the MTX-naïve population with poor prognostic factors in FINCH 3, Filgotinib in combination with MTX 
did not seem to be better than Filgotinib monotherapy in preventing structural damage (although no 
formally statistically significant differences could be reported). There were numerically lower 
progressions in all three Filgotinib groups compared to in the MTX monotherapy group.  
Taken together, the week 24 radiographic data from these two studies are of clear interest as an 
important goal of RA therapy is to limit structural progression.  
Long term favourable effects- Beyond 24 weeks 
The interim data from the on-going phase 2 open-label extension study DARWIN 3 (with no control arm) 
that was submitted with this application is considered to provide some support for maintenance of efficacy 
up to 1 year and beyond. Together with the week 52-data from the FINCH 1 study (in MTX-IR) and FINCH 
3-data (in MTX-naïve), maintenance of effect of filgotinib (on a group level) is considered to have been 
sufficiently demonstrated. 
The week 52 radiographic data provided in response to the D120 LoQ, was overall consistent with the 
week 24 data. 
3.7.1.2.  Importance of unfavourable effects 
The major safety concern given the immunosuppressive effect of filgotinib is the risk for infections. The 
most commonly reported infections were mild (for example upper respiratory tract infections, 
nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infection), although also severe infections and deaths due to infections 
occurred. Infections are frequently observed in the RA population and it is an expected risk with all 
immunosuppressive drugs. The risk seems comparable to other JAK inhibitors and TNF blockers. 
There is concern on an increased risk for venous thromboembolism for all agents in the JAK class. This is 
considered possible to handle through information in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/424374/2020  
Page 165/170 
 
 
 
 
There is currently limited long-term data on the safety profile of filgotinib. Up to current cut-off, the 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate of death is higher for filgotinib 200 mg than for the comparator 
adalimumab, although the actual numbers are small. The relevance of this observation is difficult to 
assess taken into account that overall the differences between all the analyzed treatment groups are 
small with overlapping 95% CIs and that there are no dose-dependency observed for the most important 
AESIs of serious infections, MACE or malignancy. The CHMP considered that those uncertainties would 
need to be followed-up post approval but were sufficiently addressed in the SmPC and the RMP. 
Regarding safety in fragile populations, there is very limited experience from the use of filgotinib in 
patients over 75 years of age. In the available data, an increased risk for serious AEs is observed for the 
200 mg compared to the 100 mg dose. Therefore, a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended to patients 
aged 75 or above.  
In patients with moderate renal impairment, a 1.96-fold increase of AUCeff is observed. Therefore, a dose 
of 100 mg is recommended to patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.  
JAK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, and filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy.  
There is concern on the clinical consequences of non-clinical findings on substantial decrease of fertility, 
impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs. These unexpected 
findings were observed already from 4 weeks of treatment and with low marginals and only partial 
recovery. The clinical consequences of these findings are currently uncertain and are being investigated 
in ongoing studies in human males (MANTA [Study GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-RAy [Study 
GLPG0634-CL-227]). At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has included warnings in the SmPC section 
4.4, the PL and in the educational material regarding the risk for infertility in male patients treated with 
filgotinib, aiming to limit the use of filgotinib to female patients and male patients without intent of 
fathering a child. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP until the results of the MANTA studies are 
available (1st half 2021). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Favourable effects in terms of overall clinical response (as measured by ACR 20) achieving disease target 
state (as measured by the proportion of subjects reaching low disease activity and remission) and 
prevention of structural damage have been demonstrated across the populations targeted by the 
proposed indication. Both short term and long-term favourable effects i.e. maintenance of effect have 
been shown. 
The CHMP questioned the initially proposed indication “[Tradename] is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have highly active 
and early progressive (erosive) disease, were not previously treated with MTX, and for whom treatment 
with MTX is inappropriate” in the D120 LoQ in the light of the data submitted with this application, the 
totality of data on JAK-inhibitors that has so far become available and also considering that such 
indication would have been the 1st in the class. The first line indication was withdrawn by the applicant 
with their responses to the D120 LoQ. 
In addition, filgotinib was initially proposed to be given either in monotherapy or in combination with MTX 
or other csDMARDs. Since data supporting the combination with csDMARDs other then MTX were not 
presented, this was raised as a major objection in the D120 LoQ. As a consequence, the proposal for use 
in combination with csDMARDs was withdrawn by the applicant with their responses to the D120 LoQ. 
The degree of support for monotherapy in DMARD-IR subjects is considered sufficient as it includes both 
observed data from DARWIN 2 and extrapolation from FINCH 3. Extrapolation from the first-line FINCH 3

EMA/424374/2020

study is considered justified on the basis of filgotinib in combination therapy generally displaying efficacy 
across the treatment lines. 
The major safety concern given the immunosuppressive effect of filgotinib is the risk for infections. The 
most commonly reported infections were mild (for example upper respiratory tract infections, 
nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infection), although also severe infections and deaths due to infections 
occurred. Filgotinib is contraindicated in active serious infections and active TB. Adequate warnings are 
included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The clinical consequences of non-clinical findings on substantial decrease of fertility, impaired 
spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs are unknown. The clinical 
consequences of these findings are being investigated in ongoing studies in human males (MANTA [Study 
GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-RAy [Study GLPG0634-CL-227]). At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has 
included warnings in the SmPC section 4.4, the PL and in the educational material regarding the risk for 
infertility in male patients treated with filgotinib, aiming to limit the use of filgotinib to female patients and 
male patients without intent of fathering a child. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP until the 
results of the MANTA studies are available (1H21). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Jyseleca is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Jyseleca is favourable in the following indication:

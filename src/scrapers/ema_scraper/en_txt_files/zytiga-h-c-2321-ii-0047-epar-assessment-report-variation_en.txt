Newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. An estimated 1.1 million men worldwide were 
diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012, accounting for 15% of the cancers diagnosed in men, with 
almost 70% of the cases (759,000) occurring in more developed regions. In 2012, 420000 new cases 
were diagnosed and 101000 deaths estimated in Europe (Globocan, 2012). 
The risk of clinically significant prostate cancer is related to age, ethnicity, family history, PSA level, 
free/total PSA ratio and findings on digital rectal examination (DRE) (Thompson IM, et al. 2006). 
At diagnosis, patients may present with localised, regional or distant metastatic disease. Approximately 
15-30% of newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer have metastatic disease at the time of 
Assessment report

diagnosis (Flamand 2008, Howard 2001, Jack 2009, Jonsson 2006, Norgaard 2010, Quaglia 2003). 
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has allowed earlier detection of prostate cancer. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Newly diagnosed prostate cancers are dependent upon androgen through activation of the androgen 
receptor. Androgens are a key factor in prostatic development, homeostasis and malignancy.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone naïve prostate cancer (mHNPC) typically have a high 
disease  burden,  and  the  majority  present  with  bone  metastases  (James  2015).  Bone  metastases  are  a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality, and therefore pose a substantial burden as they are associated 
with skeletal-related events, pain, and the need for radiation therapy or surgery to bone (Smith 2012). 
The median survival for patients with mHNPC is variable (ranging from 13 months up to 75 months), and 
is dependent on the presence of high-risk prognostic features such as high PSA at diagnosis, high Gleason 
score, increased volume of metastatic disease, presence of bony symptoms (Milikan 2008) or presence of 
visceral metastasis (Gandaglia 2014). 
As  a  guide  to  prognosis  and  therapy,  localised  disease  is  classified  as  low-,  intermediate-  or  high-risk. 
Patients with intermediate- (T2b and/or GS7 and/or PSA10-20) or high-risk disease (≥T2c or GS8-10 or 
PSA >20) should be staged for metastases (Cancer of the Prostate: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines). 
The  prostate  cancer  staging  summary  (7th  edition of  the  AJCC/UICC  Cancer  Staging  Handbook)  is  used 
for clinical staging (Cancer of the Prostate: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines).  
2.1.5.  Management 
Hormone sensitive prostatic cancer (HSPC) responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. In the 
hormone  naïve  setting  the  standard  of  care  has  historically  been  ADT  (luteinizing  hormone-releasing 
hormone [LHRH] agonist or surgical castration) with or without concurrent anti-androgens.  
Recently, docetaxel-based chemotherapy has shown to provide significant benefit on OS when combined 
with ADT metastatic or locally advanced hormone-naïve disease (James at al, 2016; Sweeney et al, 2015) 
thus  changing  disease  course  (OS  medians  in  the  range  of  50-60  months  compared  to  medians  around 
32-45  months  if  treated  with  standard  ADT)  and  treatment  decisions  in  the  metastatic  castration-
resistant setting. 
The ESMO guideline recommends continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as first-line treatment 
of  metastatic,  hormone-naïve  disease  and  ADT  plus  docetaxel  as  first-line  treatment  of  metastatic, 
hormone-naïve disease in men fit enough for chemotherapy. Three phase III trials compared ADT alone 
versus ADT plus docetaxel in men with metastatic, hormone-naïve disease and showed a progression-free 
and/or  overall  survival  benefit  for  the  combination  arm  (Sweeney  C,  et  al.  2014;  Gravis  G,  et  al.  2013, 
James ND, et al. 2015). Although the efficacy of docetaxel was positive, clinically significant toxicity was 
also noted (Gravis 2013, James 2016). The toxicities associated with docetaxel include myelosuppression 
(including  febrile  neutropenia),  fatigue,  alopecia,  diarrhoea,  neuropathy  and  peripheral  oedema  (Parker 
2015, docetaxel package insert 2015).

About the product 
Abiraterone  acetate  (ZYTIGA)  is  converted  in  vivo  to  abiraterone,  an  androgen  biosynthesis  inhibitor. 
Specifically,  abiraterone  selectively  inhibits  the  enzyme  17α  hydroxylase/C17,20  lyase  (CYP17).  This 
enzyme  is  expressed  in  and  is  required  for  androgen  biosynthesis  in  testicular,  adrenal  and  prostatic 
tumour  tissues.  CYP17  catalyses  the  conversion  of  pregnenolone  and  progesterone  into  testosterone 
precursors,  DHEA  and  androstenedione,  respectively,  by  17α  hydroxylation  and  cleavage  of  the  C17,20 
bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. 
Treatment  with  ZYTIGA  plus  prednisone  or  pednisolone  decreases  serum  testosterone  to  undetectable 
levels (using commercial assays) when given with LHRH analogues (or orchiectomy). 
A  marketing  authorisation  was  granted  by  the  European  Commission  on  5  September  2011  for  ZYTIGA 
plus prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate 
cancer  (mCRPC)  whose  disease  has  progressed  on  or  after  a  docetaxel-based  chemotherapy  regimen 
based on the pivotal Study COU-AA-301.  
A Type II variation to extend the indication of ZYTIGA plus prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment 
of  patients  with  mCRPC  who  are  asymptomatic  or mildly  symptomatic  after  failure  of  ADT  and  in  whom 
chemotherapy  is  not  yet  clinically  indicated,  based  on  pivotal  Study  COU-AA-302,  was  subsequently 
approved in the European Union (18 December 2012).  
Zytiga  plus  prednisone  or  prednisolone  is  currently  authorised  in  more  than  100  countries  worldwide 
(including the EU and US) for the treatment of men with mCRPC (exact wording of indications vary). 
The applied and recommended indication is: 
ZYTIGA plus prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for: 
• 
the  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  high  risk  metastatic  hormone  sensitive  prostate  cancer 
(mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see SmPC section 5.1) 
The recommended dose is 1,000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) as a single daily dose that must not be taken 
with food. Taking the tablets with food increases systemic exposure to abiraterone (see SmPC 
sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
For mHSPC, ZYTIGA is used with 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Scientific  advice  was  sought  from  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  on  19 
April  2012  (EMEA/H/SA/985/3/2012/II)  and  on  20  March  2014  (EMEA/H/SA/985/3/FU/1/2014/II)  in 
relation to the pivotal study PCR3011 submitted in support of the present application.  
Discussion  points  covered  the  key  elements  of  the  study,  including  sample  size,  inclusion  of  co-primary 
endpoints, and the statistical analysis plan. A brief summary of the conclusions of the advice are shown 
below. 
EMEA/H/SA/985/3/2012/II (April 2012) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The CHMP agreed that the proposed key inclusion exclusion criteria appear appropriate 
In order to minimise the risk of bias, the CHMP did not recommend an open-label trial 
The use of prednisone in the control group would be desirable 
There are no specific concerns regarding ADT as the reference 
•  A successful submission requires sufficiently mature data on overall survival (OS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 8/81 
 
  
  
•  Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) could be affected by the open-label nature of the 
trial and the company should make every effort to make rPFS as precise and robust as possible 
•  CHMP agreed that no new PK data would be required 
•  Results from a single pivotal study should be convincing and compelling 
EMEA/H/SA/985/3/FU/1/2014/II (March 2014) 
• 
The approach to amend the ongoing study to promote rPFS to co-primary endpoint with OS was 
agreed 
•  CHMP agreed that rPFS with a positive trend in OS, and support from secondary endpoints, would 
be considered a valid measure of clinical benefit 
• 
The double blind design was expected to contribute to minimising bias 
•  CHMP agreed with the proposed secondary endpoints 
• 
• 
The proposed audit of a random sample of 160 scans could in principle be acceptable 
The proposed analysis plan was endorsed. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Apart from the environmental risk assessment, no new non-clinical data have been submitted in this 
application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data were submitted in this 
application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was submitted to support the extension of the ZYTIGA plus 
prednisone or prednisolone indications to include the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic 
hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT). Formerly, the MAH submitted an ERA that was assessed as part of the initial MA 
application for Zytiga 250 mcg tablets. An extended partial life cycle study with fathead minnow 
(Pimephales promelas) was subsequently submitted. The aim of this study was to assess the specific 
mode of action of abiraterone acetate for endocrine disrupting substances, according to the OECD 
recommendations. Within this study, an updated ERA report, the toxicity NOEC and PECSURFACEWATER were 
refined. In the ERA submitted in the current application, the MAH has refined the PEC SURFACEWATER. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the result of the ratio PECsurfacewater/PNECwater, it is concluded that abiraterone acetate may 
represent a risk to organism populations in the aquatic environment. 
Therefore, abiraterone acetate should be used according to the current precautions stated in the SmPC in 
order to minimise any potential risks to the environment (see SmPC sections 5.3 and 6.6.).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new data were provided with this submission, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The PK 
of abiraterone has been characterised in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with mCRPC who have 
progressed on or after treatment with docetaxel in Study COU-AA-301, and in chemotherapy-naïve 
patients who are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms in the ongoing Study COU-AA-302. It is not 
expected that abiraterone PK in the newly diagnosed mHNPC patient population in Study 212082PCR3011 
would deviate significantly from that observed in the latter 2 patient groups studied. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamic 
No new data were provided with this submission, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The mechanism of action of abiraterone has been previously described (see SmPC section 5.1). 
However, there remains a need to develop biomarker strategies to better understand and identify a priori, 
patients who will derive most benefit from abiraterone. The Clinical Study Report (CSR) and trial protocol 
of the main study (see under clinical efficacy) describes secondary objectives of identifying predictive 
markers of abiraterone response or resistance. Exploratory analysis of biomarker tumour samples 
collected from patients enrolled in this study is ongoing. Expression of response and resistance marker(s) 
will be correlated with rPFS. Although exploratory nature of this analysis is acknowledged, these data is of 
interest and the MAH is recommended to submit the results at the earliest opportunity for formal 
assessment (see letter of recommendations).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No new dose responses studies were submitted with this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. The dosing of ZYTIGA is in line with the two other approved prostate cancer indications; aside 
from the change in the recommended dose of prednisone from 10 mg daily to 5 mg daily. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study  LATITUDE:  A  randomised,  double-blind,  comparative  study  of  abiraterone  acetate  plus  low  dose 
prednisone plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus ADT alone in newly diagnosed subjects with 
high risk, metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC)  
Methods 
This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study of abiraterone 
acetate plus low-dose prednisone and ADT (AA-P group) compared with placebo and ADT (Placebo group) 
in subjects with newly diagnosed (within 3 months) mHNPC who had high-risk prognostic factors. 
The  study  consisted  of  a  Screening  Phase  of  up  to  28  days  before  randomization  to  establish  eligibility 
and document baseline measurements, a Double-blind Treatment Phase (28-day treatment cycle), and a 
Follow-up Phase of up to 60 months to monitor survival status and subsequent prostate cancer therapy. 
An Open-label Extension Phase was also planned to allow all subjects to receive active study drug (AA-P) 
in the event of a positive study result at either the interim analyses or the final analysis. 
Extension Phase will allow subjects to receive active drug (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) for up to 
3 years. A diagrammatic representation of the study design is presented below:

Study participants 
The subjects selected for participation in this study were adult men (≥18 years) with high-risk, newly 
diagnosed mHNPC, who met the following acceptance criteria: 
•  Newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer with metastases within 3 months prior to 
randomization with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology 
•  Distant metastatic disease documented by positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI 
scan 
•  At least 2 of the following 3 high-risk prognostic factors:  
-    (1) Gleason score ≥ 8,  
-    (2) presence of ≥ 3 lesions on bone scan,  
-    (3) presence of measurable visceral (excluding lymph node disease) metastasis on CT or 
MRI scan (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) 
•  ECOG performance status grade of 0, 1, or 2 
Subjects were not to be enrolled into the study if it were determined upon pre-study examination that 
they had significant cardiac, adrenal, or liver dysfunction; a malignancy other than prostate cancer or 
non-melanoma skin cancer within 5 years; or a significant laboratory abnormality. In addition, exclusions 
to participation were:

•  Active infection or other medical condition that would make prednisone use contraindicated 
•  Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher systemic dose of corticosteroid than 5 mg 
prednisone per day 
• 
Pathological findings consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate 
•  Known brain metastasis 
• 
Prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer, except for 
up to 3 months of ADT or 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy as outlined in the 
protocol. 
•  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP≥95 mmHg). 
Subjects with a history of hypertension are allowed provided blood pressure is controlled by anti-
hypertensive treatment 
•  Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders 
secondary to hepatic dysfunction 
•  History of adrenal dysfunction 
•  Clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic 
events or history of cardiac failure in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina, or New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV heart disease 
•  Existing atrial fibrillation with or without pharmacotherapy. Other cardiac arrhythmia requiring 
pharmacotherapy 
•  Other malignancy (within 5 years), except non-melanoma skin cancer 
•  Administration of an investigational therapeutic or invasive surgical procedure (not including 
surgical castration) within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 or currently enrolled in an investigational 
study 
•  Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk, 
may confound study results, or interfere with the subject’s participation in this study. 
Treatments 
•  Abiraterone acetate (1,000 mg once daily) and low-dose prednisone (5 mg once daily) plus ADT 
(AA-P group) or  
• 
Placebos of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT (Placebo group). 
Selection of the ADT (LHRH agonist) was at the investigator’s discretion, and dosing was consistent with 
the respective product labelling. Subjects could also have opted to undergo surgical castration in lieu of 
receiving ADT by LHRH analog. 
Abiraterone acetate/placebo was to be taken on an empty stomach. No food was to be consumed for at 
least 2 hours before the dose of abiraterone acetate/placebo and for at least 1 hour after the dose of 
abiraterone acetate/placebo. Tablets were to be swallowed whole with water. If an abiraterone 
acetate/placebo dose was missed, it was to be omitted and not made up. 
Prednisone/placebo 5 mg was to be taken orally once daily. It did not need to be taken at the same time 
as the abiraterone acetate/placebo dose. If the prednisone/placebo dose was missed, it was to be omitted 
and not made up. 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 15/81 
 
  
  
The dose and frequency of administration of the LHRH agonist was to follow the prescribing information 
and was only to be adjusted if clinically indicated to achieve and maintain subcastrate concentrations of 
testosterone (<50 ng/dL or <1.7 nM). 
Subjects were to receive treatment until documented disease progression, withdrawal of consent, dosing 
noncompliance, or unacceptable toxicity. Study drug was to be discontinued prior to documented 
radiographic progression if the investigator determined that the subject had experienced clinical 
progression. Treatment also was to have been discontinued due to dosing noncompliance, unacceptable 
toxicity, or subject choice.  
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study was to determine whether abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in 
combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was superior to ADT alone in improving 
radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in subjects with metastatic 
hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) with high-risk prognostic factors. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were: (a) to evaluate the clinically relevant improvements as well 
as the safety of abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone and ADT compared to ADT alone and (b) to 
identify microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA profiles predictive of abiraterone acetate response or resistance. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Analysis for the Co-Primary Endpoints: rPFS and Overall Survival 
The co-primary endpoint of rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of 
radiographic progression or death from any cause. Radiographic progression included progression by 
bone scan (according to modified PCWG2) and progression of soft tissue lesions by CT or MRI (according 
to RECIST 1.1), both assessed by investigators. Subjects without radiographic progression or death were 
censored at the last disease assessment. Tumour measurements (CT or MRI and bone scans) were 
assessed at screening and then every 4 months starting with Cycle 5 in accordance with PCWG2 
recommendations. 
To assess any potential bias with the investigator-assessed radiographic progression, an audit plan was in 
place to randomly select at least 160 evaluable subjects for BICR. If a bias was present, a complete BICR 
of all subjects’ scans would be performed. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, OS, was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death 
(regardless of cause). Survival time of living subjects was censored on the last date the subject was 
known to be alive as of the cutoff date for the interim analysis. 
Follow-up for survival was to occur every 4 months up to 60 months after subjects discontinued study 
drug.

Sample size 
The overall level of significance for the study was 0.05, allocated between the 2 co-primary endpoints 
(0.001 for rPFS and 0.049 for OS). The timing of the first interim analysis was determined according to 
both rPFS and OS events required, so that the analysis would take place when the required number of 
events for both measures has been reached. Subjects were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive AA-P or 
Placebo (ADT alone). 
It was assumed that failure would follow an exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate for both 
the rPFS and OS endpoints. It is estimated that 565 rPFS events would be required to provide at least 
94% power in detecting a HR of 0.667 (median rPFS of 20 months for the ADT alone group versus 30 
months for the AA-P group) at a 2-tailed level of significance of 0.001. Assuming a median OS of 33 
months for the control group (placebo; ADT alone), a planned sample size of approximately 1,200 
subjects provides 85% power to detect a HR of 0.81 (33 months versus 40.75 months, or >7 months of 
improvement) at a 2-tailed overall significance level of 0.049 and an enrollment duration of 
approximately 24 months over a total study duration of 78 months to obtain the required 852 death 
events. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either abiraterone acetate (1,000 mg once 
daily) and low-dose prednisone (5 mg once daily) plus ADT (AA-P group) or placebos of abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone and ADT (Placebo group). 
Prior to randomization, eligible subjects were stratified by presence of measurable visceral disease and 
ECOG performance status, and then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the active treatment (i.e., AA-P 
group) or control group (Placebo group). Randomization was facilitated by a centralized interactive web 
response system (IWRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Randomization codes were maintained within the IWRS, which had the functionality to allow the 
investigator to break the blind for an individual subject. Investigators were instructed that under normal 
circumstances, the blind was not to be broken. Unblinding could have occurred in the following situations: 
• 
• 
• 
If specific emergency treatment/course of action dictated knowing the treatment status of the 
subject 
If the subject discontinued from the study because of disease progression, and the investigator 
considered the information was essential to determine the next course of therapy 
In the event the IDMC recommended unblinding and crossing over of subjects to active treatment 
(abiraterone acetate) 
It was recommended that the investigator contact the Sponsor or its designee if possible to discuss the 
particular situation before breaking the blind. In the event of unblinding, the Sponsor was to be notified 
as soon as possible, and the date, time, and reason for unblinding documented in the IWRS, eCRF, and 
source document. Subjects who had their treatment assignment unblinded were to be discontinued from 
the Double-blind Treatment Phase and entered into the Follow-up Phase.

Statistical methods 
Unless otherwise specified, all continuous endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics, which 
included the number of subjects with a valid measurement (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. 
Time-to-event endpoints were analysed using Kaplan-Meier product limit methods to estimate the 
survival distributions and the median time-to- event. Inference for time-to-event endpoints were 
assessed using a stratified log-rank statistic as the primary analysis. The proportional hazard assumption 
was assessed graphically by plotting log (-log [estimated survival distribution function]) against log 
(survival time). The resulting graphs have approximately parallel lines when the assumption holds. If the 
proportional hazards assumption was reasonably met, then the HR was used as an estimate of treatment 
effect. 
The rPFS and OS distribution, median rPFS and median OS, and the 95% confidence intervals were 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference for OS was evaluated according to the 
group sequential testing design. The resulting statistic (stratified log-rank test statistic) was evaluated 
using East software to ensure that it was compared with the appropriate stopping boundary given the 
precise number of events observed at the time of the interim analysis. 
A supportive analysis, using the Cox proportional hazards model, was performed. The score statistic, 
which is equivalent to a log-rank test statistic, was used to provide an adjusted estimate of the HR and 
corresponding 2-tailed 95% confidence interval. 
Comparisons of secondary endpoints between treatment groups were conducted according to the 
Hochberg test procedure at an overall 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. 
Estimates of the time-to-event endpoints were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival 
distributions. Statistical inference was evaluated similarly as in the primary analysis, except that it was 
not evaluated using the group sequential testing design. The relative risk (AA-P:Placebo) for response 
rate was reported along with the associated 2 tailed 95% CIs. Statistical inference was evaluated using 
the Chi square statistic; the Fisher’s exact test was used if the expected counts in some cells are small. 
Endpoints with change in scores used 2 independent t-test procedures. For PROs, a repeated measures 
model was used to estimate the mean PRO scores at each cycle. 
Sensitivity analyses: 
Sensitivity analyses on primary endpoints were performed to assess the robustness and consistency of 
the endpoints. The results from the analyses were not adjusted for multiplicity testing. In the event a 
large number of subjects crossover to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or other life-extending 
subsequent therapies, additional sensitivity analyses were used in estimating the true treatment effect. 
Subgroup Analysis for the Co-Primary Endpoints:  
A non-stratified analysis on co-primary endpoints of rPFS and OS was performed. Subgroup analyses 
were planned for the co-primary endpoints (rPFS and OS) to investigate whether treatment effects were 
consistent within subgroups using a non-stratified univariate model. Each subgroup was analysed 
separately. The pre-planned subgroups were as follows: Age (<65, ≥ 65, ≥ 75), ECOG performance status 
grade (0/1 versus 2) at randomization, Gleason score (<8 versus ≥8), Number of baseline bone lesions 
(≤10 versus >10), Presence of visceral disease at randomization (Yes versus No), Baseline PSA was 
greater than the median baseline value (Yes versus No), LDH value was greater than the median baseline 
value (Yes versus No), Region (Eastern EU, Western EU, Asia Pacific, Rest of World) 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 19/81 
 
  
  
The HR within each subgroup was estimated using a non-stratified Cox proportional hazard model. 
Results from these analyses were considered consistent with the primary analysis if the 95% confidence 
interval for the HR within the subgroup included the point estimate for the primary analysis. 
Other exploratory analyses: 
A post hoc multivariate analysis was conducted to evaluate the treatment effect when controlling for 
clinically meaningful factors (ECOG performance status scale, baseline serum PSA, baseline LDH, 
measurable visceral, bone metastasis at baseline and age) at baseline to estimate the HR for treatment 
effect. Then a Cox regression model was run with treatment and those factors as covariates. 
A post hoc analysis of time to life-extending subsequent therapy for prostate cancer was conducted as 
done for the similar secondary endpoint, i.e., time to subsequent therapy for prostate cancer. 
The strength of association between rPFS and OS was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, 
estimated through the Clayton copula,4 which takes censoring into account. 
A non-stratified analysis of PSA response based on PCWG2 Criteria was conducted; the relative risk (95% 
CI) and p value were calculated based on confirmed responses. A PSA response was defined as a ≥ 50% 
decline from baseline according to PCWG2 criteria. For a PSA response to be confirmed, an additional 
central laboratory measurement obtained 4 or more weeks later had to show ≥ 50% decline from 
baseline. 
To evaluate the treatment outcome following the subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, analysis of 
progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) was performed. PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to 
the second disease progression during follow-up after the subsequent therapy, or to death from any 
cause. Patients alive and for whom a second progression had not been observed were censored at the 
last time known to be alive and without second disease progression. 
Patient-reported outcome measures of BPI-SF, FACT-P, BFI, and the EQ-5D-5L were evaluated to assess 
treatment effect on pain, prostate cancer symptoms, functional status, and health-related quality of life. 
The analyses of these PRO outcomes are described in the PRO Statistical Analysis Plan in Appendix 9 
(PRO). 
In addition, other analyses were conducted to evaluate treatment effect: time to symptomatic local 
progression (i.e., occurrence of urethral obstruction or bladder outlet obstruction symptoms requiring 
medical or surgical intervention), prostate cancer-specific survival (i.e., time from randomization to death 
date due to prostate cancer), time to chronic opiate use (i.e., time from randomization to new opioid 
analgesics use, or increased dose or frequency of the existing opioid analgesics from Cycle 1 Day 1 for 
≥ 3 weeks orally or 7 days parenterally), and best overall response as assessed by RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
(including complete response and partial response). Also, an evaluation of testosterone levels over time 
was conducted to determine if subjects’ castration levels were met. 
Planned Analyses 
A single analysis was planned for the co-primary endpoint of rPFS, after ~565 rPFS events occurred. The 
OS endpoint incorporates the group sequential design by including 2 interim analyses and 1 final analysis 
with an alpha spending function calculated as Wang-Tsiatis power boundaries of shape parameter 0.2 
(East software). 
Analyses of the co-primary endpoint OS were planned to occur following ~426, ~554, and ~852 death 
events (corresponding to approximately 50%, approximately 65%, and 100% of the total events) using 
the ITT population (i.e., all subjects randomized into the study at the time of the interim analysis) (Table 
2). The cumulative alpha spend was planned to be 0.011 and 0.022 for each of the 2 interim analyses, 
respectively. The exact significance levels were planned to be determined according to the observed

number of events at each interim analysis. It was expected that the first interim OS analysis would likely 
occur in conjunction with the rPFS analysis.

Recruitment 
From 12 February 2013 (first subject randomized) until 11 December 2014 (last subject randomized), 
1,209 subjects were randomized at 236 sites in 34 countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, 
South Africa, Canada, and Latin America.  
The clinical cutoff was 31 October 2016 (main analysis for rPFS and first IA for OS (48% of total events)). 
Data from 10 subjects at Site 70139 were excluded (due to GMP non-compliance of the study site). The 
remaining 1,199 subjects comprise the ITT population. All ITT subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug comprise the Safety population.  
Table  3  -  Primary  Reason  for  Treatment  Discontinuation;  Safety  Population  (Study 
212082PCR3011) 
74 subjects in the ITT population were unblinded during the study, 31 subjects in the AA-P group and 43 
subjects in the Placebo group. The majority of subjects in the AA-P and Placebo groups were unblinded 
with the sponsor’s approval, as permitted by the protocol, after disease progression (27 and 38, 
respectively) and a small number of subjects were unblinded for other unspecified reasons (4 and 5, 
respectively). No subjects were unblinded due to an adverse event.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was amended 3 times. Amendments INT-1, and INT-2 were considered to be 
substantial and INT-3 was considered non-substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Details of each 
amendment are included in the protocol. 
Amendment INT-1 (27 November 2012; N=0 subjects enrolled) 
The overall reason for the amendment was to address requests and recommendations from health 
authorities, investigators, and ethics committees. Major changes associated with this amendment are 
outlined below. 
•  Abiraterone acetate would be provided for a maximum of 3 years during the Open-label Extension 
Phase. 
• 
PSA results would be made available to investigators and investigators would be notified if 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 22/81 
 
  
  
 
 
testosterone levels did not fall below 50 ng/dL (or <1.7 nM; i.e., castrate levels). In these cases, 
the dose and frequency of LHRH agonist could be adjusted. 
• 
• 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were updated to include all of the parameters utilized in the 
Child-Pugh classification for chronic liver disease. Inclusion Criterion 7 required a screening serum 
albumin of ≥3 g/dL; Exclusion Criterion 7 excluded subjects with active or symptomatic viral 
hepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction. 
Inclusion Criterion 5 (definition of high risk prognostic factor) specified that only CT or MRI scans 
were acceptable for measurement of visceral metastases. 
•  Exclusion Criterion 5 (prior therapy) revised the timing to allow for up to 3 months of ADT with 
LHRH agonists or orchiectomy with or without concurrent anti-androgens prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; 
and clarified that subjects may have had 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to 
treat symptoms resulting from metastatic disease if it was administered at least 28 days prior to 
Cycle 1 Day 1 with all AEs associated with these procedures resolved at least to Grade 1 by Cycle 
1 Day 1. Baseline echocardiograms were not required. Therefore, Exclusion Criterion 9 was 
revised to exclude subjects with clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial 
infarction, or arterial thrombotic events or history of cardiac failure in the past 6 months, severe 
or unstable angina, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV heart disease. 
• 
• 
To monitor for peripheral oedema throughout treatment, the requirement was added that weight 
be measured at all visits during the Double-blind Treatment Phase. Amendment INT-2 (18 April 
2014; N=739 subjects enrolled) 
The overall reason for the amendment was to add rPFS as a co-primary endpoint with OS. Given 
that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone had already demonstrated a statistically significant 
survival benefit in patients with mCRPC who received prior chemotherapy, rPFS along with 
important secondary endpoints (e.g., time to subsequent chemotherapy, time to opiate use for 
cancer pain) and a strong trend in OS was considered a measure of clinical benefit to patients 
with newly diagnosed hormone-naïve high-risk metastatic prostate cancer. Therefore, rPFS was 
promoted from a secondary endpoint to a co-primary endpoint to provide an alternate measure of 
efficacy. Major changes associated with this amendment are outlined below. 
• 
The planned sample size was changed from 1,270 to 1,200 subjects, the anticipated study 
enrollment duration was changed from 30 to 24 months, the total study duration was changed 
from 74 to 78 months to obtain the required number of final OS death events (n=852) 
•  A description of the statistical assumptions for the hypothesized rPFS HR was added, and the 
projections for the number of events needed for the 2 interim and final analyses were revised 
based on the change in α from 0.05 to 0.049 due to the addition of the rPFS co-primary endpoint 
•  Moved the endpoint “time to pain progression” from an exploratory to a secondary efficacy 
endpoint 
•  All CT, MRI, and bone scans will be sent to a central location for potential auditing Purposes 
Revised Exclusion Criterion 5.1: Anti-androgen use is allowed for up to 2 weeks after Cycle 1 Day 
1 to adequately control tumour flare for subjects receiving LHRH agonist 
•  Revised Exclusion Criterion 10.1: to exclude subjects with existing atrial fibrillation with or 
without pharmacotherapy 
•  Removed the requirement for haematology assessments during the Open-label Extension Phase 
• 
Frequency of liver function test (LFT) monitoring was increased to at least once per week for 
subjects with Grade 2 or 3 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate amino 
Assessment report

transferase (AST) 
•  Defined conditions under which subjects were to be discontinued due to opioid use for cancer pain 
as the initiation of new opioid analgesics or increased dose or frequency of existing opioid 
analgesics for at least 3 weeks orally or 7 days parenterally 
Amendment INT-3 (24 March 2016; N=1209 subjects enrolled) 
The overall reason for the amendment was to revise the protocol language to accommodate for the time 
gap between the final rPFS and 1st interim analysis for OS. Therefore, the text was revised to clarify that 
the analysis of rPFS will occur at an estimated 565 rPFS events. 
Protocol Deviations 
Major protocol deviations for eligibility criteria not met are summarized in Table 4.  
Note that 1 subject in the Placebo group in Table 5 (under “Subject did not meet inclusion or exclusion 
criteria”) based on the Sponsor’s assessment of eligibility is not included in Table 4, which is based on the 
investigator’s assessment of eligibility from the eCRF.

The most common protocol deviation was having received the wrong treatment or the incorrect dose, i.e., 
dose interruptions or reductions were not performed correctly as per protocol guidelines for management 
of adverse events (6.2% for AA-P; 2.3% for Placebo). Only 3 subjects received the alternate treatment 
for 1 to 2 months (1 kit) over the duration of the study: 1 subject received active prednisone instead of 
placebo (1 month out of 13 months), 1 subject received placebo instead of active abiraterone acetate 
(1/2 month out of 26 months), and 1 subject received active abiraterone acetate instead of placebo (1 
month out of 10 months). 
Treatment compliance 
Throughout the study, study sites maintained logs of the investigational tablets that were dispensed and 
returned. Compliance with study drug administration was to be assessed on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, 
once a month from Cycles 4 to 13, then every 2 months until the end of study treatment.

Concomitant Medications 
As required by the protocol, all subjects were to have received GnRH analog or have had an orchiectomy. 
Since 144 (12%) subjects underwent an orchiectomy prior to randomization and another 12 (1.0%) 
subjects underwent orchiectomy after randomization, as expected the most common class of concomitant 
medication taken by subjects was endocrine therapy (89.6% and 90.0% of subjects in the AA-P and 
Placebo groups, respectively); specifically, GnRH agonists (also known as LHRH agonists) were taken by

87.9% of subjects in the AA-P group and 87.9% of subjects in the Placebo group. Degarelix was classified 
under other hormone antagonists and related agents and was received by 0.8% of subjects in the AA-P 
group and 0.5% of subjects in the Placebo group. 
Subsequent therapy 
A summary of subsequent therapies for prostate cancer is presented in Table 11.  
Antineoplastic agents were administered as subsequent therapy for 18.3% of subjects in the AA-P group 
and 31.9% of subjects in the Placebo group. Anti-androgens (consisting of bicalutamide, enzalutamide, 
and flutamide) were administered to 11.6% of subjects in the AA-P group and 24.1% of subjects in the 
Placebo group. The most commonly administered subsequent therapy was docetaxel (17.8%, AA-P; 
31.1%, Placebo), followed by bicalutamide (7.7%, AA-P; 14.0%, Placebo), enzalutamide (5.0%, AA-P; 
12.6%, Placebo), and abiraterone acetate (1.7%, AA-P; 8.6%, Placebo).

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT population, which included 1,199 randomized subjects 
(597 subjects in the AA-P group and 602 subjects in the Placebo group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
•  Radiographic Progression-Free Survival  
As of the cutoff date, among the 1,199 randomized subjects assessed by investigators, 593 (49.5%) 
subjects had radiographic progression or died: 239 (40.0%) in the AA-P group and 354 (58.8%) in the 
Placebo group. Radiographic PFS is presented in Table 13 and Figure 1. 
Treatment with AA-P was statistically significant with a decreased risk of radiographic progression or 
death by 53% compared with Placebo (HR=0.466; 95% CI: 0.394, 0.550; p<0.0001). The median rPFS 
was 33.0 months in the AA-P group and was 14.8 months in the Placebo group. 
The 24-month event-free rate was 61.1% for AA-P treatment and 34.7% for Placebo. The 36-month 
event-free rate was 47.1% for AA-P and 20.9% for Placebo. 
The unstratified analysis of rPFS (HR=0.466; p<0.0001) was consistent with the stratified analysis.

•  Overall Survival 
At the time of main (only analysis planned) rPFS analysis a first IA on OS was performed (planned to be 
performed at approximately 50% of total events). The results of the first interim analysis of OS are 
presented in Table 14 and Figure 2.  
At the time of the data cutoff, 406 deaths were observed: 169 (28.3%) in the AA-P group and 237 
(39.4%) in the Placebo group. The median follow-up time for all subjects was 30.4 months. The hazard 
ratio for OS was 0.621 (95% CI: 0.509, 0.756; p<0.0001), representing a 38% reduction in the risk of 
death; the median survival was not reached in the AA-P group and was 34.7 months in the Placebo 
group. The prespecified nominal statistical significance level based on the Wang-Tsiatis efficacy boundary 
with observed 406 events is 0.010.

On 12 January 2017, the IDMC reviewed trial data and recommended the study to be unblinded because 
of  “compelling”  clinical  benefit.  From  that  point  cross-over  of  patients  from  Placebo  to  AA-P  arm  is 
allowed.  A  second  interim  analysis  of  OS  is  planned  at  approximately  554  (approximately  65 %  of  total 
events) events and a final analysis is planned at approximately 852 events (total events). 
Sensitivity Analysis for Overall Survival 
Subjects in the Placebo group received more life-extending subsequent therapy (20.9 % in AA-P and 
40.9% in Placebo group (Table 12). A sensitivity analysis of OS conducted using the Inverse Probability 
censoring weight (IPCW) method, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS in favor of AA-P

(HR: 0.477; 95% CI: 0.3596, 0.6336, p<0.0001) after adjusting for subjects switching to other life-
extending subsequent therapy. 
A sensitivity analysis of OS conducted using a time-dependent Cox regression prior to subjects receiving 
subsequent anticancer therapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS in favor of AA-P 
(HR: 0.573; 95% CI: 0.4453, 0.7369; p<0.0001). 
A sensitivity analysis of OS conducted using censoring at the time of initiation of life-extending 
subsequent anticancer therapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS in favour of AA-P 
(HR: 0.577; 95% CI: 0.449, 0.743; p<0.0001). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
Time to Initiation of Chemotherapy 
Time to initiation of chemotherapy was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the 
date of initiation of chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Initiation of chemotherapy was documented for 
18.3% of subjects in the AA-P group and 31.7% of subjects in the Placebo group (Table 15 and Figure 3). 
There was a 56% reduction in risk of initiation of chemotherapy (HR=0.443; 95% CI: 0.349, 0.561, 
p<0.0001). The median time to initiation of chemotherapy was not reached in the AA-P group and was 
38.9 months in the Placebo group demonstrating that AA-P delayed the need for initiation of 
chemotherapy. The 36-month event free rate (i.e., percent of subjects for whom chemotherapy was not 
required at 3 years after initiation of study treatment) was 75.3% for AA-P versus 54.0% for Placebo.

Time to subsequent therapy (all subsequent therapy for prostate cancer including hormonal therapy, 
chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to 
the date of initiation of subsequent therapy for prostate cancer and is provided in Table 16 and Figure 4.  
There were 32.0% of subjects in the AA-P group and 53.5% of subjects in the Placebo group who 
received subsequent therapy for prostate cancer. The median time to subsequent therapy was not 
reached in the AA-P group and was 21.6 months in the Placebo group (HR=0.415; 95% CI: 0.346, 0.497; 
p<0.0001), demonstrating that AA-P delayed the need for initiation of subsequent therapy.

The time to life-extending subsequent therapy (i.e., docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T, and radium-223) was analysed; a summary of life-extending 
therapy received during the study is provided in Table 12 of this report.  
There were 20.9% of subjects in the AA-P group and 40.9% of subjects in the Placebo group who

received life-extending subsequent therapy (i.e., docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T, and radium-223).  
The median time to life-extending subsequent therapy was not reached in the AA-P group and was 29.5 
months in the Placebo group, demonstrating that AA-P delayed the need for initiation of life-extending 
subsequent therapy (HR=0.365; 95% CI: 0.294, 0.454; p<0.0001). The 36-month event-free rate was 
70.1% for AA-P and 43.3% for Placebo. 
• 
Time to Pain Progression 
Time to pain progression was defined as the time interval from randomization to the first date a subject 
experiences a ≥30% increase from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity (Item 3) observed at 2 
consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart. Time to pain progression is presented in Figure 5. Pain 
progression was documented for 39.0% of subjects in the AA-P group and 48.0% of subjects in the 
Placebo group. There was a 31% reduction in risk of pain progression (HR=0.695; 95% CI: 0.583, 0.829; 
p<0.0001). The median time to pain progression was not reached in the AA-P group and was 16.6 
months in the Placebo group. The 36-month event-free rate (i.e., the percent of subjects without pain 
progression at 3 years after initiation of study treatment) was 55.5% for AA-P versus 37.9% for Placebo. 
Figure 5 - Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Pain Progression (BPI3); Intent-to-treat Population 
(Study 212082PCR3011) 
Sensitivity Analysis for Time to Pain Progression 
In a population of subjects who have no or minimal pain, a 2-point increase in time to pain intensity 
progression may be more clinically relevant. Therefore, an analysis for time to worst pain intensity 
progression (2-point increase) was conducted. A 2-point increase in time to pain intensity progression 
was defined as the time interval from randomization to the first date a subject experienced an increase 
by 2 points from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity item (Item 3) observed at 2 consecutive 
evaluations ≥4 weeks apart. 
Treatment with AA-P reduced the risk of worst pain intensity progression (2-point increase) by 37% 
compared with placebo; the median time to pain progression (2-point increase) was not reached in either

treatment group (HR=0.631; 95% CI: 0.517, 0.770; p<0.0001). The 36 –month event-free rate was 
64.9% in the AA-P group compared with 51.2% in the Placebo group. 
• 
Time to Skeletal-related Event 
Time to skeletal-related event was defined as the earliest of the following: clinical or pathological 
fracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or surgery to bone. There was a 30% 
reduction in the risk of skeletal-related event (HR=0.703; 95% CI: 0.539, 0.916; p=0.0086). The 25th 
percentile time to skeletal-related event was not reached for the AA-P group and was 33.0 months for 
Placebo. A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to skeletal-related event is presented in Figure 6.

• 
Time to PSA Progression (by PCWG2 Criteria) 
Time to PSA progression was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of 
PSA progression, according to PCWG2 criteria. Prostate-specific antigen progression was documented for 
40.4% of subjects in the AA-P group and 72.1% of subjects in the Placebo group (Figure 7). Treatment 
with AA-P statistically significantly decreased the risk of PSA progression by 70% compared with Placebo 
(HR=0.299; 95% CI: 0.255, 0.352; p<0.0001). The median time to PSA progression was 33.2 months in 
the AA-P group and 7.4 months in the Placebo group, a delay in PSA progression by >25 months in the 
AA-P group compared with the Placebo group.

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints Analyses 
Exploratory analyses included PSA response rate, progression-free survival following subsequent therapy 
(PFS2), PRO measures (BPI-SF, FACT-P, BFI, and EQ-5D-DL),  time to symptomatic local progression, 
prostate cancer-specific survival, time to chronic opiate use, and best overall response. Castration status 
is also included in this section. 
PSA Response Rate 
A confirmed PSA response was observed in 91.0% of subjects in the AA-P group and 66.8% of subjects in 
the Placebo group (relative risk=1.362; p<0.0001). 
Progression-free Survival Following Subsequent Therapy (PFS2) 
Progression-free survival following subsequent therapy (PFS2) was defined as the time from 
randomization to the second disease progression during follow-up after systemic subsequent therapy, or 
death from any cause. 
Among the 164 (27.5%) subjects in the AA-P group and 296 (49.2%) subjects in the Placebo group that 
received systemic subsequent therapy, 98/164 (59.8%) and 183/296 (61.8%) experienced PFS2 events, 
respectively. The median PFS2 was longer with initial AA-P treatment (27.8 months) compared with initial 
Placebo treatment (23.9 months), but did not reach statistical significance (HR=0.819; 95% CI=0.638, 
1.051; p=0.1162). Note that PFS2 was based on investigator-assessed progression 
(clinical/radiographic/PSA progression), after first subsequent therapy, and this progression was not 
based on a protocol-defined criterion definition. 
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures: BPI-SF, FACT-P, BFI, EQ-5D-5L 
PRO data for the BPI-SF, FACT-P, BFI, and EQ-5D-5L were collected at baseline, every month from Cycle 
2 to Cycle 13, every 2 months thereafter until radiographic or clinical progression of disease, and at the 
end of study treatment visit. In addition, EQ-5D-5L data were collected further, i.e., every 4 months for a 
total of 12 months after treatment discontinuation.

•  Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form 
The BPI-SF was used to measure subjects’ self-assessment of pain experienced during the study. The 
cumulative compliance rate for completion of the BPI-SF was greater than 95.0% through Cycle 13 and 
90.0% or greater thereafter (through Cycle 47); compliance rates were similar across the treatment 
groups.

Time to Event Analysis on BPI-SF 
The results for BPI-SF Worst Pain Intensity (BPI-SF Item 3, a secondary efficacy endpoint, titled “Time to 
Pain Progression”) and the corresponding sensitivity analysis utilising a 2-point scale are presented under 
secondary endpoints subheading (see above). 
Time to BPI-SF pain interference progression (Combined scale of Items 9A through 9G, Impact of Pain on 
Interference with Activities) showed that treatment with AA-P significantly reduced the risk of pain 
interference progression by 33% compared with treatment with Placebo (HR=0.671; 95% CI: 0.561, 
0.803; p<0.0001). The median time to BPI-SF pain interference progression was not reached in the AA-P 
group and was 18.4 months in the Placebo group. 
Time to BPI-SF average pain progression (average of BPI-SF Items 3, 4, 5, and 6) showed that the 
median time to BPI-SF average pain progression was not reached in either treatment group; HR=0.896; 
95% CI: 0.691, 1.162; p=0.4057. It should be noted that the majority of subjects in this analysis were 
censored (80.6%, AA-P group; 81.1%, Placebo). 
•  Repeated Measures Analysis on BPI-SF 
Change from baseline using the repeated measures mixed-effect model was conducted for BPI-SF worst 
pain intensity, pain interference and average pain progression. Significant differences were observed as 
early as Cycle 2 through Cycle 33 for all BPI measures, except for Cycle 3 for BPI-SF average pain 
progression and Cycle 25 for BPI-SF pain interference, with lower mean scores for AA-P indicative of less 
pain intensity, interference, and progression.  
• 
FACT-P 
The FACT-P is a prostate-specific PRO instrument used to measure prostate cancer symptoms, functional 
status, and health-related quality of life. 
Time to Event Analysis: The results for the FACT-P Total Score showed that treatment with AA-P 
statistically significantly delayed the time to health-related quality of life degradation by 15% (HR=0.853; 
95% CI: 0.736, 0.989; p=0.0322) (Mod5.3.5.1\PCR3011\Sec5.4.3.2.1). The median time to deterioration 
in FACT-P (Total Score) was 12.9 months in the AA-P group and 8.3 months in the Placebo group. 
The results for the FACT-P Pain-related Subscale (PRS) showed that treatment with AA-P statistically 
significantly delayed the time to pain-related symptoms by 24% (HR=0.760; 0.659, 0.876; p=0.0001). 
The median time to degradation in FACT-P PRS was 10.2 months in the AA-P group and 6.5 months in the 
Placebo group. 
A summary of the FACT-P Total Score and subscale score results is presented in Table 17. Results for the 
majority of subscales of the FACT-P were consistent with a delay of degradation of functional status and 
health-related quality-of-life for the AA-P group compared with the Placebo group. The other FACT-P 
subscales showed a statistically significant decrease in the risk of worsening function for subjects in the 
AA-P group compared with the Placebo group (PCS, p=0.0025; other subscales, p=0.0001), except for 
the FACT-P subscales of Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), Social/Family Well-
Being (SFWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB), and Functional Well-Being (FWB). 
The FACT-P endpoints showed a consistent pattern of delays in pain and prostate cancer symptom

progression, as well as degradation of functional status, and health-related quality of life in subjects 
treated with AA-P compared with Placebo. 
Table 17 - Summary of FACT-P Total Score and Subscale Score Results (Study PCR3011: ITT 
Population) 
Repeated Measures Analysis: Change from baseline using repeated measures mixed effect model was 
conducted for FACT-P total score and all subscales. Significant differences were observed favouring AA-P 
versus placebo as early as Cycle 2 for the FACT-P PRS, as early as Cycle 4 for PWB, and as early as Cycle 
5 for the FACT-P Total, PCS, TOI, FACT-G through Cycle 33.  
Clear numeric separation was observed for FWB with significant differences as early as Cycle 3 and then 
for the majority of the cycles (except Cycle 4, Cycle 11, and Cycle 33). Numeric differences were 
observed between groups for EWB with some of these differences being significant. No differences were 
observed between AA-P versus placebo for the SFWB. 
•  BFI 
The BFI instrument was used to evaluate fatigue. 
Time to Event Analysis: For time to BFI worst fatigue intensity progression (Item 3), treatment with AA-P 
significantly delayed the time to BFI worst fatigue interference progression by 35% (HR=0.652; 95% CI: 
0.527, 0.805; p=0.0001); the median time to BFI worst fatigue intensity progression was not reached in 
either the AA-P or Placebo group. 
For time to BFI fatigue interference progression (average of Items 4A-4F), treatment with AA-P 
significantly delayed the time to BFI fatigue interference progression by 41% (HR=0.594; 95% CI: 0.470, 
0.750; p<0.0001); the median time to BFI fatigue interference progression was not reached in either the 
AA-P or Placebo group. 
Repeated Measures Analysis: Change from baseline using the repeated measures mixed-effect model was 
conducted for BFI worst fatigue intensity and BFI fatigue interference scales. Significant differences 
between groups were observed in both BFI worst fatigue intensity and fatigue interference as early as 
Cycle 5 through Cycle 33, except for Cycles 17 and 27 for BFI worst fatigue intensity. 
•  EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D-5L questionnaires were used to measure mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression and health-related quality of life. A summary of the health states from the five 
dimensions and the VAS score for overall health status over time are presented in. Changes from baseline 
on the VAS were all positive for subjects treated with AA-P and were numerically greater than those from

the Placebo group. 
Time to Symptomatic Local Progression 
Time to symptomatic local progression, defined as the occurrence of urethral obstruction or bladder outlet 
obstruction symptoms requiring medical or surgical intervention (e.g., transurethral resection of the 
prostate, nephrostomy tube insertion, bladder catheter insertion) is presented in 
Mod5.3.5.1\PCR3011\Sec5.4.4. Overall, only a small number of subjects experienced such an event, 33 
(5.5%) subjects in AA-P group and 37 (6.1%) subjects in Placebo group. The analysis of time to 
symptomatic local progression favoured treatment with AA-P compared with Placebo (HR=0.683; 95% 
CI: 0.426, 1.097; p=0.1126); the median time to symptomatic local progression was not reached in 
either treatment group. Note that the majority of subjects in this analysis were censored (94.5%, AA-P; 
93.9%, Placebo) as only 5.8% of subjects across both treatment groups experienced symptomatic local 
progression. 
Prostate Cancer-specific Survival 
Prostate cancer-specific survival, defined as the time from randomization to death date due to prostate 
cancer, is summarized in Mod5.3.5.1\PCR3011\Sec5.4.5. Subjects who were alive or who died due to 
other reasons were censored at last date of known alive or death not due to prostate cancer. Death due 
to prostate cancer occurred less frequently in the AA-P group (122 [20.4%] events) as compared to the 
Placebo group (194 [32.2%] events). A statistically significant improvement in prostate cancer-specific 
OS was observed for the AA-P group compared with the Placebo group (HR=0.547; 95% CI: 0.436, 
0.687; p<0.0001). 
Time to Chronic Opiate Use 
Time to chronic opiate use was defined as the time from randomization to new opioid analgesics use, or 
increased dose or frequency of the existing opioid analgesics (from Cycle 1 Day 1 for ≥3 weeks orally or 
7 days parenterally [for non-oral formulations]). Subjects with no event were censored at the last dose + 
30 days. A slightly lower percentage of subjects in the AA-P group compared with those in the Placebo 
group received chronic opioid analgesics (20.8% vs. 22.8%) and received this medication much later (24-
month event free rate: 80.0% vs. 71.3%). A 29% reduction in risk of requiring chronic opioid use was 
observed (HR=0.706; 95% CI: 0.553, 0.902; p=0.0051). The median time to chronic opioid analgesic 
use was not reached in either treatment group. It should be noted that the majority of subjects in this 
analysis were censored (79.2%, AA-P group; 77.2%, Placebo group) as less than 25% of subjects across 
both treatment groups received chronic use of opioid analgesics. 
Best Overall Response 
Best overall response in subjects with measurable disease at baseline (257 subjects in AA-P group and 
271 in Placebo group), as assessed by RECIST 1.1. A higher percentage of subjects in the AA-P group 
compared with those in the Placebo group achieved a complete or partial response. Complete response 
was observed in 59 (23.0%) subjects in the AA-P group and 41 (15.1%) subjects in the Placebo group. 
Partial response was observed in 147 (57.2%) subjects in the AA-P group and 137 (50.6%) subjects in 
the Placebo group, while stable disease was observed in 34 (13.2%) and 50 (18.5%) subjects, 
respectively. 
The unstratified analysis of objective response rate favored treatment with AA-P over Placebo (relative 
risk=1.220, p=0.0002) and was consistent with the stratified analysis. 
Castration Status 
Castration level for testosterone <0.50 ng/mL (<1.70 nmol/L) was attained for the majority of subjects at 
baseline (61.2% for AA-P group and 61.8% for Placebo group). Overtime the majority of subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 44/81 
 
  
  
AA-P and Placebo groups were below the castration level (Cycle 3, Day 1: 95.3% and 92.5%, Cycle 6, 
Day 1: 96.6% and 93.8%, End of Treatment: 96.4% and 93.8%, respectively). As a result, subjects on 
AA-P treatment as well as those who received Placebo treatment received adequate castration treatment 
for prostate cancer. 
Ancillary analyses 
Radiographic Progression-Free Survival  
•  Subgroup Analyses of Radiographic Progression-free Survival  
Subgroup analyses of rPFS are presented in Figure 8. The treatment effect of AA-P on rPFS was 
favourable and consistent with the overall study population (HR<1.0; ranging from 0.32-0.73), except for 
the subgroup of ECOG score of 2.

Symmetry of Time of Tumour and Bone Assessments 
The timing of tumour and bone scan assessments through 96 weeks after randomization is presented 
below. Tumour and bone scan assessments were to be performed every 16 weeks. The timing of 
assessments in both treatment groups adhered closely to the visit schedule specified in the protocol. No

differences in the timings of the assessments were noted between the treatment groups. 
Radiographic Review by Audit Plan 
An audit was performed based on a random sample of 202 evaluable subjects, i.e., subjects who had 
both a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline disease assessment (100 in AA-P group and 102 in Placebo 
group) to compare the investigators’ assessments with that of the BICR. 
The results are as follows: 
Early discrepancy rates (EDR) (AA-P) – EDR (Placebo) was 10.1%, which is greater than - 10%, and 
Late discrepancy rates (LDR) (AA-P) – LDR (Placebo) was -12.4%, which is less than 10%. 
The IDMC reviewed the results and concluded no bias favouring the AA-P group. 
Overall survival 
•  Subgroup Analyses of Overall Survival 
The subgroup analyses of OS are presented in the figure below. The point estimates of the treatment 
effect of AA-P on OS were favourable for all subgroups (HR<1.0; ranging from 0.50-0.82) and consistent 
with the overall study results, except for the subgroup of ECOG score of 2.

•  Multivariate Analysis of Overall Survival 
A multivariate analysis was conducted for OS to evaluate the treatment effect when controlling for 
potential prognostic factors. After adjusting for these prognostic factors, the results remain supportive of 
the primary analysis (Table 18).

The strength of association between rPFS and OS was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation coefficient 
estimated through the Clayton copula (Burzykowski 2001) which takes censoring into account. A positive

Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone is currently indicated for the treatment of patients 
with mCRPC (see SmPC section 4.1 for detailed indications). The new claimed indication for abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone is for an earlier setting of metastatic prostate cancer, prior to 
development of castration resistant disease. In the hormone naïve setting the standard of care has 
historically been ADT (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or surgical castration) with 
or without concurrent anti-androgens. Recently, docetaxel-based chemotherapy has shown to provide 
significant benefit on OS when combined with ADT metastatic or locally advanced hormone-naïve disease 
(James et al, 2016; Sweeney et al, 2015) thus changing disease course (OS medians in the range of 50-
60 months compared to medians around 32-45 months if treated with standard ADT) and treatment 
decisions in the metastatic castration-resistant setting. 
In support of the present application, the MAH submitted the results of study LATITUDE (PCR3011) which 
is phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial in which AA (1000 mg once daily) plus low dose prednisone (5 
mg) administered add-on to ADT was compared to ADT alone (placebo group) in subjects with newly 
diagnosed (within 3 months prior to randomization) mHNPC with high-risk prognostic factors. High-risk is 
defined as having at least 2 of the following 3 risk factors: (1) Gleason score of ≥ 8 of primary tumor; (2) 
presence of 3 or more lesions on bone scan; (3) presence of measurable visceral (excluding lymph node

disease) metastasis. The term mHNPC refers to either metastatic hormone naïve prostate cancer or 
metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer as the study population included those subjects that may 
have never received hormonal therapy (naïve) as well as subjects who received up to 3 months of 
hormonal therapy but were still responsive to treatment (sensitive). Newly diagnosed patients in this 
first-line setting could have received previous prostate cancer therapy not more than three months prior 
to randomization consisting of LHRH analogues or orchiectomy with or without concurrent antiandrogens 
or one course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to treat symptoms. Prior chemotherapy, radiation 
therapy or surgery were not allowed out of these exceptions.  
The MAH has provided a statement regarding GCP compliance for the main study. However, GCP-non-
compliance was detected at one investigative site during a sponsor conducted audit which led to the 
exclusion of 10 patients from the ITT population. The MAH implemented a number of tools to ensure the 
robustness and integrity of the clinical trial data. Aside from the non-compliant GCP site, no major study 
conduct issues are identified.  
Stratification according to ECOG status (0, 1 vs. 2) and presence of measurable visceral metastases (yes 
vs. no excluding lymph node metastases) was performed. The prednisone dose proposed to be 
administered together with AA was lower than that to be used in the castration resistant setting in an 
attempt to reduce long-term toxicity of higher doses of corticosterioids, which is acceptable.  
Although ADT is considered an appropriate comparator, based on the recent results of the large 
STAMPEDE and CHAARTED trials, ADT plus docetaxel (6 cycles) is currently considered an alternative for 
some patients based on the significant benefit shown in terms of OS in metastatic or locally advanced 
hormone-naïve disease (James at al., 2016; Sweeney et al, 2015). In this sense, a head to head 
comparison vs. docetaxel would have been also informative. 
In terms of choice of endpoints, the use of rPFS along with OS as co-primary endpoint is acceptable, 
seeing as rPFS would provide a faster endpoint to observe the benefit from this approach, whereas OS 
can indeed offer most valuable information about the benefit in the long-run, with important facts 
regarding the right sequence. PFS2 is also endorsed with the objective in mind of exploring cross-
resistance phenomena.  
The primary analysis of rPFS was based on the investigator-assessment of progression. To confirm the 
absence of investigator bias, a radiology review by independent assessors was planned on a sample of at 
least 160 evaluable subjects. The proposal for an audit plan in a representative sample was reviewed and 
accepted by the SAWP. 
Demographic characteristics are considered consistent with that of a population newly diagnosed mPC, 
nevertheless as also previously observed in trials in the castration resistant setting the number of 
patients with ECOG PS=2 is limited and black race patients are underrepresented. This has been 
adequately reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Median time from diagnosis to first dose was 1.8 and 2.0 months for AA-P and Placebo arms respectively. 
All patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis with a 97.4% having bone metastases (46.3% >20 bone 
lesions) and 47.7% having node involvement. The trial population can be considered representative of a 
high-risk population as defined by the company, most patients has a Gleason score ≥8 (Gleason score=8 
in 45.7%; =9 in 45.4% and =10 in 6.5% of patients). The majority of patients (95.3%) presented with 
(Gleason score ≥8+≥3 bone lesions) and an additional 11.8% had (Gleason score ≥8+≥3 bone lesions+ 
Measurable visceral disease). 14.1% presented with (Gleason score ≥8+ Measurable visceral) and a 
minority complied with the 3 criteria to be considered high risk (14.1% had both +≥3 bone lesions+ 
Measurable visceral disease without a Gleason score ≥8). 
Baseline pain score was ≥4 for 27.6% of patients. PSA level at baseline was similar between the 
treatment groups (median: 25.43 ng/mL, AA-P; 23.05 ng/mL, Placebo). 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 53/81 
 
  
  
Regarding prior therapies for prostate cancer, the majority of patients had received previous therapies 
(no more than 3 months prior to randomization) only 79 patients had not received any prior therapy. 
Importantly, significant amendments to study protocol were introduced by means of two important 
protocol amendments and an additional amendment that introduced minor changes. Main changes 
pertained to the inclusion of rPFS as co-primary endpoint with OS (the previously planned single primary 
endpoint) and also changes on the definition of “high-risk” population. The company informed about 
changes introduced by the first two protocol amendments which affected, among others, two of the main 
aspects of trial design in a follow-up scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/985/3/FU/1/2014/II): the primary 
efficacy endpoint (INT-2) and key characteristics of study population (INT-1). According to SA letter, the 
definition of high risk patients changed in a manner that could potentially lead to bias in trial population. 
Initially high risk patients were those with Gleason score of ≥8 and/or presence of cancer-related bone 
pain (defined as BPI-SF score ≥4 in the worst pain over the last 24 hours or requirement for the use of 
opioid analgesics to treat cancer-related pain associated with distant metastases). This was subsequently 
modified and according to the new definition Gleason score >8 was not mandatory anymore and a patient 
could be considered as high risk with visceral disease and bone metastasis. Although pain may not be so 
directly related to survival, high Gleason score together with presence of bone pain and poor performance 
status seem to be the most important prognosis factors for a shorter life expectancy. In spite of the 
methodological concerns related to a change in the target population made during the conduct of the 
trial, no concerns were raised by the SAWP given the status of enrolment at the time of review. 
Protocol deviations were reported in 12.7% of trial population (14.7% in AA-P arm vs. 10.6% in Placebo 
arm) being most of them due to subjects receiving disallowed concomitant treatments, wrong treatment 
or incorrect dose of due to non-compliance with eligibility criteria. Numbers are small and thus there is no 
impact on study outcomes is foreseen. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis in support of this application was performed at the data cut-off of 31-oct-
2016. This was the only planned analysis for rPFS and the first IA planned for OS, two additional analyses 
one IA and one final were planned OS.  
Cross-over of patients progressing on placebo arm to AA-P was recommended by the IDMC after the cut-
off date for the efficacy analyses presented in this report, thus no impact of cross over on efficacy 
endpoints is present for the time being.  
With 49.45% (593/1199) of the total events, results in terms of rPFS based on investigator assessment 
showed a median rPFS of 33.02 months (95%CI: 29.57, NE) for the AA-P arm which represents a 18-
months increase compared to the Placebo arm, 14.78 months (95%CI: 14.69, 18.27). The addition of 
AA-P to backbone ADT therapy decreased the risk of radiographic progression or death (rPFS) by 53% 
compared with ADT alone (HR=0.466; 95% CI: 0.394, 0.520; p<0.0001) which is considered clinically 
relevant for the target population.  
The fact that the analysis of time of tumour and bone assessments shows symmetry between study arms 
is reassuring. An audit plan was planned by the company to randomly review a subset of evaluable 
subjects (n=202) concluding the lack of bias in the investigator assessment, with an agreement rate 
around 90% between investigators’ and BICR assessments. There was no evidence of investigator bias in 
the assessment of rPFS based on thresholds for the late and early discrepancy rates of -10% for EDR and 
10% for LDR. The discrepancy rates were 10.1% for EDR and -12.4% for LDR. 
Results in terms of the co-primary endpoint OS at the time of the first interim analysis are immature 
(33.9% event). An update on OS data is expected to be available at the time of the 2nd preplanned IA 
(1Q 2018). In spite of the low rate of events, a statistically significant result shows an early marked result 
in favour of AA-P (HR=0.621; 95% CI: 0.509, 0.756; p<0.0001). The use of subsequent therapies known

to have impact on patient´s survival was almost 2-fold higher in the placebo arm, which is in line with 
what can be expected based on primary results. Although the magnitude of the impact that subsequent 
therapies have in OS results cannot be completely elucidated, the company performed different 
sensitivity analyses all supporting primary analysis. 
Subgroup analyses for both co-primary endpoints showed consistent results in all subgroups analysed but 
for patients with ECOG-PS=2. Although the limited number of patients with ECOG PS=2 (n=40) precludes 
from drawing firm conclusions, section 5.1 of SmPC has been revised to reflect this observation.  
Main secondary endpoints which indirectly reflect the quality of life of patients were: Time to initiation of 
chemotherapy, Time to subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, Time to pain progression, Time to SRE, 
Time to PSA progression. All showed statistically significant results in favour of AA-P arm with medians 
not reached in any of the endpoints in the AA-P arm but for time to PSA progression (median AA-P arm 
33.2 months vs. 7.4 placebo arm). 
Additional exploratory endpoints also favoured AA-P arm. A PSA response was observed in 91% of 
patients in AA-P arm vs. 66.8% in placebo arm. PROs consistently favoured AA-P arm. 
A trend for longer PFS2 was observed in the AA-P arm (27.8 months and 23.9 months) with a HR<1 but 
not reaching statistical significance, which is to some extent expectable given the limited number of 
patients that received subsequent therapies in the AA-P arm (27.5% vs.49.2% in placebo arm). 
Overall, in spite of the immaturity of the results submitted in terms of OS, a marked and statistically 
significant difference is observed in favour of AA-P arm. An increase in rPFS of the observed magnitude 
(18-month increase in median rPFS) together with evidence of positive result in terms of OS and 
improvement in the quality of life of patients as pointed out by results of secondary endpoints is deemed 
clinically compelling for the proposed setting. 
Apart from issues related to the comparator arm, the main uncertainty of this assessment is related to 
treatment sequencing. The lack of mature OS data appears critical when it comes to answering the 
question whether early initiation of AA-P is better than its use in later lines appears. The impact of the 
use of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone administered to mHNPC patients rather than in the castration-
resistant setting on the development of cross-resistances and on the overall survival and overall patient´s 
benefit could not be evaluated based on available data.  
Despite a clear benefit is observed in terms of main efficacy endpoints, it is highly unlikely that unbiased 
OS data can be obtained because of the noise that cross-over of patients will have in future analyses. An 
exploratory analysis of OS according to the different treatment sequences received by patients after 
progression in trial PCR3011 i.e. chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy or vice versa, was 
requested in order to try to depict treatment sequencing after abiraterone acetate use in the hormone 
naïve setting. Given the limited data available no reliable conclusions on best treatment sequencing can 
be drawn.  
Overall, it seems challenging to assess the impact that early initiation of AA-P may have on cross-
resistance development. Although PFS2 results appear to point out in a positive direction, further data is 
needed. Efficacy analysis in the subset of patients that received enzalutamide as subsequent therapy to 
abiraterone acetate plus prednisone compared to those patients who did not was also submitted. 
Although a 2.7 months difference is observed between those patients who received subsequent 
enzalutamide and those who did not, the exploratory nature of the analysis and the limited number of 
subjects (n=30) that received enzalutamide as subsequent therapy after discontinuation of AA-P limits 
drawing any firm conclusion. Updated PFS2 data is expected to be submitted by the company at the time 
of the second IA on OS (1Q 2018) and these data might shed some light on cross-resistance development 
(see letter of recommendations). Additionally, exploratory data from biomarker analysis (currently 
ongoing) is expected to be provided by the company as soon as available (see letter of 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017

recommendations). 
As part of the application, the Applicant presented descriptive data across relevant trials to contextualise 
the results seen in study PCR3011 to current clinical standard of care. In similar populations of prostate 
cancer patients, statistically significant improvements in OS were observed with the addition of docetaxel 
to ADT, in both the STAMPEDE study (HR: 0.76, p=0.005) and the CHAARTED study (HR: 0.60, 
p<0.001). Based on this data, the ADT + docetaxel combination is considered to be the standard of care 
for mHNPC patients eligible for chemotherapy (and referenced in the current ESMO guideline on prostate 
cancer; 2015).  Comparable survival results are seen in study PCR3011, when abiraterone acetate + 
prednisone was added to ADT (HR: 0.62, p<0.0001). The utility of more effective blockage of the 
androgen-receptor axis has also been explored in the STAMPEDE study; 1:1 randomisation ADT alone or 
ADT + abiraterone acetate + prednisone (n= 1917, multi-stage, multi-arm platform design study - 
published recently as James et al., 2017; New England Journal of Medicine). With a median follow up of 
40 months, the HR for OS was 0.63 (0.52-0.76) and the HR for treatment-failure events 0.29 (0.25-
0.34). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Results from trial PCR3011 show a statistically significant and clinically relevant result in terms of both 
rPFS and OS. The magnitude of the observed effect is considered of clinical relevance with a 18-month 
increase the median rPFS together with an already positive outcome in terms of OS despite the 
immaturity of survival data. Secondary endpoints consistently supported primary efficacy outcomes, 
indirectly reflecting improvement in the quality of life of patients. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Summary of known safety profile of abiraterone as described in the current SmPC 
The most common adverse reactions seen with abiraterone are peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, 
hypertension and urinary tract infection. Other important adverse reactions include cardiac disorders, 
hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic alveolitis. Abiraterone may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and 
fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic consequence of its mechanism of action. In clinical studies, 
mineralocorticoid adverse reactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone than in patients treated with placebo: hypokalaemia 21% 
vs.11%, hypertension 16% vs. 11% and fluid retention (peripheral oedema) 26% vs. 20%, 
respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone, CTCAE 
(version 3.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia and CTCAE (version 3.0). Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were 
observed in 4% and 2% of patients, respectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be 
successfully managed medically. Concomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity 
of these adverse reactions.  
Patient exposure 
Integrated safety population 
Safety data from a total of 3,993 subjects are included in the integrated safety population: 2,230 AA 
subjects and 1,763 Placebo subjects. The safety population includes subjects from Study PCR3011 in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017 
Page 56/81 
 
  
  
mHNPC population as well as subjects from 4 previous Phase 3 registration studies in the mCRPC 
population (Studies COU-AA-302 + ABI-PRO-3002 and COU-AA-301 + ABI-PRO-3001).  
This summary of clinical safety incorporates data from the 5 randomized phase 3 clinical studies, in which 
a total of 2,230 subjects were treated with AA 1,000 mg once daily plus prednisone/prednisolone 5 mg 
once or twice daily. Only the safety data from the double-blind phase was included for Studies ABI-PRO-
3001 and PCR3011; Studies COU-AA-301, COU-AA-302, and ABI-PRO-3002 include all unblinded safety 
data. For all 5 studies, all subjects received and remained on a stable regimen of ADT (LHRH analogs 
[LHRH agonists in Study PCR3011] or had surgical castration).  
Studies COU-AA-301 and ABI-PRO-3001 were grouped together because these 2 studies enrolled mCRPC 
patients whose disease had progressed on or after docetaxel therapy; Studies COU-AA-302 and ABI-PRO-
3002 were grouped together because these 2 studies enrolled asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
chemotherapy- naïve patients. 
The ADR analyses were generated from the ‘integrated safety population – all clinical studies’ dataset and 
are presented below. 
The ‘integrated safety population – Phase 3 studies’ and the ‘integrated safety population – all clinical 
studies’ datasets include any subject who received at least 1 dose of abiraterone acetate or placebo 
during the study.  
All subjects in both treatment groups (the AA group and the placebo group) of Studies COU-AA-301, ABI-
PRO-3001, COU-AA-302, and ABI-PRO-3002 received concurrent 10 mg prednisone/prednisolone. 
Subjects in the AA treatment group of Study PCR3011 received abiraterone acetate plus 5 mg prednisone 
and no prednisone in the placebo group.  
Extent of exposure  
In all of the Phase 3 studies included in the summary, the median treatment duration was longer in the 
AA-P group compared with the placebo group: Study PCR3011 (AA-P: 24.0 months, Placebo: 14.3 
months), COU-AA-302 and ABI-PRO-3002 (AA-P: 10.8 months, Placebo: 5.9 months), COU-AA-301 + 
ABI-PRO-3001 (AA-P: 7.4 months, Placebo: 3.7 months).  
In study 212082PCR3011, the median total treatment duration was 24 months (25 cycles, [treatment 
cycle 28 days]) in the AA-P group and 14 months (15 cycles) in the placebo group. A majority of

subjects, 91.8% of subjects in the AA-P group and 86.0% of subjects in the placebo group, received ≥6 
cycles of study drug; 54.4% and 29.7% of subjects, respectively, received ≥24 cycles.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
Adverse events were coded and reported according to standard methods. Treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) were defined as any AEs occurring or worsening in severity, on or after the first dose and 
within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Investigators were required to assess the 
relatedness of all TEAEs.  
To assess the effect of the longer duration of exposure in the AA-P group, an analysis standardising for 
the difference in treatment duration was performed for all reported AEs and reported as number of events 
per 100 patient-years (P-Y) of exposure (time on treatment). More than 1 event per subject may be 
included in this rate. This differs from the other AE analyses in which rates are calculated on the basis of 
the number of subjects who experience an event. A subject is counted only once in these analyses, 
irrespective of whether multiple events occur.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) (study 212082PCR3011) 
Based on previous experience and the known mechanism of action of abiraterone, adverse events of 
special interest were highlighted in the clinical study report.  These include cardiac disorders, events 
related to mineralocorticoid excess (hypertension, hypokalaemia, and fluid retention/oedema), 
hepatotoxicity, cataract, osteoporosis, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, allergic alveolitis and drug-drug 
interactions (CYP2D6) and food effect.  
Events related to mineralocorticoid excess: Fluid retention/oedema 
Fluid retention/ oedema were reported in 12.4% of subjects in the AA-P group and 11.3% of subjects in 
the placebo group. Peripheral oedema accounted for most of these events (9.4% vs. 8.8%). Most were 
Grade 1 or 2; no Grade 4 events were reported. No subject had fluid retention/ oedema events with an 
outcome of death. Treatment discontinuation was rare for fluid retention/ oedema. After standardising for

the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an excess of 2.3 fluid retention/oedema events/100 P Y 
(for all grades) was observed in the placebo group (9.3 in the AA-P group and 11.6 in the placebo group). 
Events related to mineralocorticoid excess: Hypokalaemia  
Hypokalaemia were reported in 20.4% of subjects in the AA-P group and 3.7% of subjects in the Placebo 
(Grade 3; 9.5% vs. 1.2%). Hypokalaemia rarely led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or 
interruption. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an excess of 17.6 
hypokalaemia events/100 P-Y was observed in the AA-P group (23.2 in the AA-P group and 5.6 in the 
placebo group). 
Events related to mineralocorticoid excess: Hypertension 
Hypertension was reported in 38.5% of subjects in the AA-P group and 23.9% of subjects in the Placebo 
group. Grade 3 events were reported in 20.9% of subjects in the AA-P group and 10.3% of subjects in 
the Placebo group. Hypertension SAEs were reported in 5 (0.8%) subjects in the AA-P group and 3 
(0.5%) subjects in the Placebo group. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment 
exposure, an excess of 20.2 hypertension events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-P group 
(57.5 in the AA-P group and 37.3 in the Placebo group). Potentially consequential events resulting from 
hypertension were rare; the incidence of death due to cardiac disorders and cerebrovascular accident was 
low and similar between both treatment groups. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity was reported in 22.4% of AA-P group and 18.1% of placebo group. The most frequently 
reported individual hepatotoxicity AE were ALT increased (16.4% vs. 12.8%), AST increased (14.6% vs. 
11.3%), hyperbilirubinaemia (2.8% vs. 0.5%), hepatic enzyme increased (1.2% vs. 0.3%), and blood 
alkaline phosphatase increased (0.3% vs. 1.2%). Grade 3 events were reported in 7.7% of subjects in 
the AA-P group and 3.3% of subjects in the Placebo group. SAEs were reported in 1.2% of subjects in the 
AA-P group and none in the Placebo group. Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients 
treated with ZYTIGA plus prednisone in Study 3011.  
Adverse events leading to dose reduction or interruption in the AA-P and Placebo groups were most 
frequently reported for AST increased (5.4% vs. 1.7%) and ALT increased (5.2% vs. 1.8%). After 
standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an excess of 8.5 hepatotoxicity 
events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-P group (45.2 in the AA-P group and 36.7 in the 
Placebo group).  
Ten patients who received ZYTIGA plus prednisone were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; two had 
Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. No patient 
died of hepatotoxicity in Study 3011. 
In the 3011 trial, patients with baseline ALT and AST > 2.5 X ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 X ULN or those with 
active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to 
hepatic dysfunction were excluded. 
Cardiac disorders 
Cardiac disorders were reported in 12.4% of subjects in AA-P group and 7.8% of subjects in the placebo 
group; arrhythmias (6.7% versus 3.3%), ischemic heart disease (3.2% versus 1.2%), cardiac disorders-
other causes (2.2% versus 3.3%), and cardiac failure (3.0% versus 1.2%). Grade 3 events were reported 
2.5% in the AA-P and 1.0% of subjects in the placebo groups. Grade 4 events were reported in 0.8% of 
subjects in the AA-P group and no subjects in the placebo group. Grade 5 events were reported in 2.0% 
of subjects in the AA-P group and 1.5% of subjects in the placebo group. SAES were reported in 3.5% of 
subjects in the AA-P group and 0.7% of subjects in the placebo group. After standardising for the 
Assessment report

difference in duration of treatment exposure, there was no difference in cardiac disorder events/100 P-Y 
(for all grades) (9.5 in the AA-P group and 9.4 in the Placebo group).  
Cataract 
Cataract events were reported in 2.7% of subjects in the AA-P group and 1.3% of subjects in the Placebo 
group. Grade 3 cataract events were reported in 5 (0.8%) subjects in the AA-P group and 1 (0.2%) 
subject in the Placebo group. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an 
excess of 0.8 cataracts/ 100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-P group (1.9 vs. and 1.1). 
Osteoporosis (including osteoporosis-related fractures) 
Osteoporosis, events were reported in 5.4% of subjects in the AA-P group and 4.2% of subjects in the 
placebo group; osteoporosis/osteopenia (4.2% versus 2.8%) and fractures (1.3% in both treatment 
groups). Grade 3 osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures were reported in 1.2% of subjects in 
the AA-P and 2.2% of subjects in the placebo group. After standardising for the difference in duration of 
treatment exposure, a slight increase of 0.3 osteoporosis events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in 
the AA-P group (3.5 in the AA-P group and 3.2 in the Placebo group). 
Rhabdomyolysis /myopathy 
Rhabdomyolysis/ myopathy was not reported for any subject in the AA-P group and in 1 (0.2%) subject 
in the placebo group with Grade 1 myopathy. 
Allergic Alveolitis 
No events of allergic alveolitis were observed in either treatment group. 
Adverse events of clinical importance 
Adverse events of clinical importance were described as anaemia, diarrhoea, sexual dysfunction, 
thrombocytopenia, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, haematuria, and adrenal insufficiency. These events 
were reported in a total of 28.3% of subjects in the AA-P group and 28.1% of subjects in the placebo 
group.  
Anaemia 
Anaemia was reported in 9.2% of subjects in the AA-P group and 14.3% of subjects in the placebo group. 
Grade 3 anaemia was reported in 2.0% vs. 4.3% of subjects. SAE were reported in 1.0% of subjects in 
each groups. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an excess of 10 
anaemia events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the placebo group (7.2 in the AA-P group and 
17.2 in the placebo group). 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea was reported in 5.0% of subjects in the AA-P group and 6.8% of subjects in the placebo group. 
Grade 3 diarrhoea; 0.3% vs. 0.2%. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment 
exposure, an excess (almost doubling) of 3.1 diarrhoea events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in 
the Placebo group (3.3 in the AA-P group and 6.4 in the placebo group). 
Sexual dysfunction 
Sexual dysfunction, decreased libido, and impotence events were reported in 16 (2.7%) subjects in the 
AA-P group and 5 (0.8%) subjects in the placebo group. Erectile dysfunction accounted for most of these 
events. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, a doubling of sexual 
dysfunction events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-P group (1.7) compared to the 
placebo group (0.7).

Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia was reported in 3.4% of subjects in the AA-P group and 3.3% of subjects in the 
Placebo group. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was reported in no subject in the AA-P group and 1.0% of 
subjects in the Placebo group. After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, 
thrombocytopenia events/100 P-Y (for all grades) were similar (3.9 in the AA-P group and 3.7 in the 
Placebo group). 
Dyspepsia 
Dyspepsia was reported in 2.8% of subjects in the AA-P group and 2.0% of subjects in the Placebo group. 
After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an increase of 0.6 dyspepsia 
events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-P group (2.1 in the AA-P group and 1.5 in the 
Placebo group). 
Urinary tract infection 
Urinary tract infection was reported in 7.2% of subjects in the AA-P group and 3.7% of subjects in the 
placebo group (Grade 3; 1.0% vs. 0.8%). After standardising for the difference in duration of treatment 
exposure, an excess of 1.7 urinary tract infection events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-
P group (5.2 in the AA-P group and 3.5 in the placebo group). 
Haematuria 
Haematuria  was  reported  in  4.5%  of  subjects  in  the  AA-P  group  and  3.2%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo 
group.  After  standardising  for  the  difference  in  duration  of  treatment  exposure,  an  increase  of  0.3 
haematuria events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the AA-P group (3.0 in the AA-P group and 
2.7  in  the  Placebo  group).  6  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the  AA-P  group  and  3  (0.5%)  subjects  in  the  Placebo 
group had Grade 3 event.

Adverse Drug Reactions 
The ADR analysis was conducted using AE data from 14 clinical studies (N=4,422): 5 Phase 3 randomized 
studies (N=3,993) ((COU-AA-301, ABI-PRO-3001, COU-AA-302, ABI-PRO-3002, and PCR3011) and 9 
Phase 1/2 single arm studies (N=429) (Studies 006, 015, PCR2007, 001/001EXT, 002, 003/003EXT, 004, 
BMA, and BE). Based upon this analysis of 14 clinical studies, the preferred terms of Fatigue and 
Hyperglycemia met the pre-specified ADR criteria: 1% (AA vs placebo) and 5 events per 100 P-Y between 
group difference (AA vs placebo).

Review of the AE data for the preferred term of Fatigue from the 5 Phase 3 studies combined (N=3,993) 
and from Study PCR3011 alone (N=1,199) did not meet the pre-defined ADR criteria. In fact, in Study 
PCR3011, there was a lower incidence of Fatigue in the AA group (12.9%) compared with the Placebo 
group (14.3%), and lower to that seen in the mCRPC studies. 
Review of the AE data for the PT of Hyperglycemia from the 5 Phase 3 studies combined (N=3,993) and 
from Study PCR3011 alone (N=1,199) did not meet the pre-defined ADR criteria. In the 5 Phase 3 studies 
combined, 8.9% of subjects in the AA group and 7.8% of subjects in the Placebo group reported AEs of 
Hyperglycemia. In Study PCR3011, Hyperglycemia was reported by 12.6% of subjects in the AA group 
and 11.3% of subjects in the Placebo group. For the 5 Phase 3 studies combined and for Study PCR3011, 
the criterion for a between group difference (AA vs Placebo) of ≥5 events per 100 P-Y was not met. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were reported in 27.6% of subjects in the AA-P group and 24.3% of subjects in 
the placebo group. Commonly reported SAEs were pneumonia (1.8% versus 0.3%), spinal cord 
compression (1.7% versus 1.8%), urinary retention (1.5% versus 1.7%), urinary tract infection (1.2% 
versus 0.8%), haematuria (1.0% versus 0.5%), back pain (0.8% versus 1.7%), bone pain (0.7% versus

Shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 3 or 4 for ALT and AST were observed in 6.4% and 4.5% of subjects in 
the AA-P group and in 1.3% and 1.5% of subjects in the placebo group. Shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to 
Grade 3 or 4 for low potassium were observed in 9.6% of subjects in the AA-P group and 1.3% of 
subjects in the Placebo group. Shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 3 or 4 for fasting serum glucose (high) 
were observed in 4.4% of subjects in the AA-P group and 2.6% of subjects in the placebo group. 
Safety in special populations 
Higher incidences of AEs were generally observed in subjects with advanced age, higher baseline ECOG 
performance status, lower baseline haemoglobin and higher baseline LDH. These findings were also 
observed in the previous abiraterone acetate studies. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no reports of new drug-drug interaction TEAEs in study PCR3011. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
For the subjects who discontinued treatment in the AA-P group (57.0%) and Placebo group (81.4%), 
progressive disease was the primary reason for discontinuation (35.0% in the AA-P group, 61.3% in the 
Placebo group). Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation were reported in 73 (12.2%) 
subjects in the AA-P group and 61 (10.1%) subjects in the Placebo group. The most frequently reported 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (reported in ≥1% of subjects in either the AA-P or Placebo 
group) were Spinal cord compression (0.8% versus 1.0%) and Bone pain (0.5% versus 1.0%). Notably, 
there were only rare cases of discontinuation for the preferred terms of hypokalaemia (0.3% in the AA-P 
group versus 0 in the Placebo group), Hypertension (0.5% in the AA-P group versus 0 in the Placebo 
group)/Blood pressure increased (0 in the AA-P group and 0.2% in the Placebo group), and in the cardiac 
disorders SOC (1.2% in the AA-P group and 0.3% in the Placebo group).

Dose interruptions, reductions, or other modifications 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction or interruption were reported for 32.2% of subjects in the AA-P 
group and 17.4% of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AEs leading to reduction 
or interruption of treatment were hypokalaemia (8.2% versus 0.7%), hypertension (7.0% versus 2.5%), 
AST increased (5.4% versus 1.7%) and ALT increased (5.2% versus 1.8%). 
Post marketing experience 
The first marketing approval for abiraterone acetate plus prednisone was on 28 April 2011 in the United 
States. Based on the 71,418,529 grams distributed worldwide, the estimated post-marketing exposure 
for abiraterone acetate from launch to 31st October 2016 is 71,418,529 person-days or 
10,202,646 person-weeks or 2,380,618 person-months or 195,667 person-years. No new ADRs have 
been detected for abiraterone from post-marketing data. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Abiraterone plus prednisone or prednisolone has been authorised in the EU since September 2011. 
Special warnings and precautions for use include hypertension, hypokalaemia, fluid retention and cardiac 
failure due to mineralocorticoid excess, hepatotoxicity and hepatic impairment, corticosteroid withdrawal 
and coverage of stress situations. These and other adverse events were considered to be adverse events 
of special interest in the clinical trial protocol.  
Treatment emergent AEs were reported in 93.5% of subjects in the AA-P group and 92.5% of subjects in 
the placebo group. The most frequently reported events in ≥20% of AA-P subjects were hypertension 
(36.7% versus 22.1%), hypokalaemia (20.4% versus 3.7%) and back pain (18.4% versus 20.4%). No 
new safety signal has been identified. The incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs was higher in the AA-P group 
compared to placebo, (63% vs. 48%). The most frequently reported events were related to 
mineralocorticoid excess and included hypertension (20.3% vs. 10.0%) and hypokalaemia (10.4% vs. 
1.3%).  
A higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive population 
(study 3011). Hypertension was reported in 36.7% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 
3011) compared to 11.8% and 20.2% in studies 301 and 302, respectively. Hypokalemia was observed in 
20.4% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) compared to 19.2% and 14.9% in 
301 and 302, respectively.  
The number of subjects with drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the AA-P 
group compared to the placebo group, 56.3% vs. 44.7% and for grade 3-4 events 27.1% vs. 11.1%. In a 
cross trial comparison, the safety profile of abiraterone plus prednisone was broadly consistent with that 
observed to the previous mCRPC Phase III studies, with the exception of Grade 3-4 drug-related adverse 
events (COU-AA-301: 15.6%, COU-AA-302: 18.2% and PCR3011: 27.1%). The Applicant proposes this 
may be due to a higher incidence of hypertension compared with the previous studies and this difference 
may be attributed to the use of more stringent criteria to determine Grade 3 hypertension. However, it 
cannot be excluded that a lower dose of prednisone (5 mg in the PCR3011 vs. 10 mg in the mCRPC 
studies) did not impact the incidence of hypertension in the pivotal study. Taking into account that 
adverse events (including hypertension) were generally manageable and the benefits outweigh the risks 
for the claimed indication, no concerns arise.

Based on previous experience and the known mechanism of action of abiraterone, adverse events of 
special interest were highlighted in the CSR. These include cardiac disorders, events related to 
mineralocorticoid excess (hypertension, hypokalaemia, and fluid retention/oedema), hepatotoxicity, 
cataract, osteoporosis, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, allergic alveolitis and drug-drug interactions (CYP2D6) 
and food effect. Consistent with the mechanism of action of abiraterone and previous clinical experience, 
mineralocorticoid-related toxicities were reported commonly in abiraterone treated subjects. 
Hepatotoxicity is a well-known abiraterone adverse reaction and was observed in the study. The current 
section 4.2 of the SmPC contains detailed guidance regarding emerging patient hepatotoxicity and drug 
interruptions, dose reduction and drug discontinuation. No further changes to the hepatotoxicity section 
are proposed on the basis of the data derived from study PCR3011. 
The incidence and severity of adverse events was higher in the subgroups of patients with baseline 
ECOG2 performance status grade and also in elderly patients (≥75 years) (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Deaths within 30 days of last dose were similar between arms, 6.7% vs. 6.1%. Marginally more serious 
adverse events were reported in the AA-P group vs. placebo, 27.6% vs. 24.3%. Adverse events leading 
to dose reduction or interruption were reported for 32.2% of subjects in the AA-P group and 17.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group.  
The reported AEs leading to dose reduction or interruption are well known events and listed in section 4.4 
of the SmPC. More subjects in the placebo group discontinued treatment, 81.4% (61.3% for disease 
progression) vs. 57.0% (35.0% for disease progression). 
The abiraterone plus prednisone group received therapy for almost twice as long as subjects in the 
placebo group (24 vs. 14 months). To assess the effect of the longer duration of exposure an analysis 
was conducted and reported as the number of events per 100 patient-years (P-Y) of exposure. When 
standardising for exposure (events per 100 P-Y), the rate of adverse events was lower for the AA-P group 
(484) compared with the placebo group (530). The following events (Grades 1 - 4) were observed at an 
excess of 5 or more events/100 P-Y in the AA-P group compared with the placebo group: hypertension 
(53.1 vs 34.6) and hypokalaemia (23.2 vs 5.6). The following events were observed at an excess of 5 or 
more events/100 P-Y in the placebo group: anaemia (7.1 vs 17.0), back pain (13.8 vs 21.3), arthralgia 
(12.3 vs 18.1) and bone pain (9.1 vs 14.0). 
The Applicant states no new ADR has been identified in the post marketing data to date. Although it 
cannot be excluded that a lower dose of prednisone did not impact the incidence of hypertension in the 
pivotal study, adverse events (including hypertension) were generally manageable and the benefits 
outweigh the risks for the claimed indication. 
The product information has been updated to reflect revised frequencies of adverse drug reactions based 
on the integrated Safety Population (see SmPC section 4.8). No new ADRs were included based on the 
review of the available safety data which is considered acceptable. No changes are warranted to the list 
of safety concerns and pharmacovigilance plan (see RMP). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The risks associated with abiraterone plus prednisone treatment in the mHNPC population are concordant 
with the known toxicities previously observed and described in the approved mCRPC population, and 
appear clinically manageable to the majority of patients.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable considering the changes to the package 
leaflet are minimal. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is: Zytiga is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult 
men with newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in 
combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 
Prostate cancer is an androgen driven malignancy. Approximately 15-30% of patients have metastatic 
disease at the time of diagnosis, typically presenting high disease burden and bone metastases in its 
majority. After standard ADT therapy, most patients will develop castration-resistant disease.   
The median survival for patients with mHNPC is variable (ranging from 13 months up to 75 months), and 
is dependent on the presence of high-risk prognostic features such as high PSA at diagnosis, high Gleason 
score, increased volume of metastatic disease, presence of bony symptoms (Milikan 2008) or presence of 
visceral metastasis (Gandaglia 2014). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the hormone naïve setting the standard of care has historically been ADT (luteinizing hormone-
releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or surgical castration) with or without concurrent anti-androgens.  
Recently, docetaxel-based chemotherapy in addition to standard ADT is considered an alternative based 
on the significant benefit shown in terms of OS in metastatic or locally advanced hormone-naïve disease 
(James et al, 2016; Sweeney et al, 2015) (OS medians in the range of 50-60 months compared to 
medians around 32-45 months if treated with standard ADT) thus changing disease course and treatment 
decisions in the metastatic castration-resistant setting. Although docetaxel plus standard ADT is currently 
recommended for patients candidates to chemotherapy, significant toxicities are associated to docetaxel 
therapy (ESMO guideline).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy data in support of this application were provided from trial PCR3011: A phase 3, randomized, 
double-blind trial in which AA (1000 mg once daily) plus low dose prednisone (5 mg) administered add-on 
to ADT was compared to ADT alone in subjects with newly diagnosed (within 3 months prior to 
randomization) mHNPC with high-risk prognostic factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/816845/2017

High-risk is defined as having at least 2 of the following 3 risk factors: (1) Gleason score of ≥ 8 of primary 
tumor; (2) presence of 3 or more lesions on bone scan; (3) presence of measurable visceral (excluding 
lymph node disease) metastasis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from trial PCR3011 study in the efficacy target population of patients at the cut-off date of 31-
oct-2016 included the main analysis planned for rPFS (investigator assessed) and the first interim 
analysis for OS (2 IA planned plus 1 final analysis). 
The outcome from one of the two co-primary endpoints of the trial (rPFS & OS) shows a statistically 
significant and clinically relevant increase of 18 months in median rPFS (median 33.2 months in the AA-P 
arm vs. 14.78 placebo arm; HR=0.466; 95% CI: 0.394, 0.520; p<0.0001). OS data though immature 
(event rate 33.9%) already reached statistical significance (median not reached in AA-P arm vs. 34.73 
months) pointing towards an effect of clinical relevance. These results are supported by several sensitivity 
and subgroup analyses.  
Secondary endpoints were included to provide additional evidence of clinical benefit, in particular delaying 
the course of the disease, and to show consistency with the primary endpoints. Treatment with AA-P 
delayed the need for initiation of chemotherapy (HR=0.443; p<0.0001), delayed the time to initiation of 
all subsequent therapy (HR=0.415; p<0.0001), delayed the time to pain progression (HR=0.695; 
p<0.0001), delayed the time to skeletal-related event (HR=0.703; p=0.0086) and delayed the time to 
PSA progression (HR=0.299; p<0.0001). Thus, the secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrated 
favourable benefit of AA-P compared to the placebo group, supporting the primary analysis.  
Exploratory analyses included PSA response rate, progression-free survival following subsequent therapy 
(PFS2), PRO measures, time to symptomatic local progression, prostate-cancer-specific survival, time to 
chronic opiate use, and best overall response and were also favourable for AA-P treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although promising results are shown in terms of OS, more mature data are needed in order to confirm 
these findings. Updated OS data will be available at the time of the 2nd preplanned IA, this is 1Q 2018 
(see letter of recommendations). However, it can be anticipated that the cross-over of patients (allowed 
after results of main analysis of rPFS and 1st IA on OS) will unavoidably confound results. 
The main drawbacks of the trial relate to the ADT comparator arm, which is not considered the only 
alternative anymore for all mHNPC patients and as such it is not possible to put the findings in context of 
current clinical practice. Furthermore, the premature unblinding of trial preclude definitive conclusion 
about the place of AA-P in therapeutic. Based on the available, it is not possible to evaluate whether early 
initiation of AA is better than its use in later lines and additionally how the introduction of AA in the 
mHNPC setting will impact not only cross-resistance to subsequent hormonal therapy but also patient’s 
benefit and long-term overall survival throughout entire course of the disease. Regarding the 
development of cross-resistances, data on PFS2 point out in the right direction as there appears to be a 
trend for longer PFS2 in the AA-P arm however data are still too immature with low percentage of events. 
Although the limited sample size of the subgroups of patients with an ECOG-PS of 2 is acknowledged, a 
consistent negative effect is observed in rPFS and OS results (PFS HR=2.43; OS HR=2.38). The SmPC 
has been updated to reflect that the treatment effect of AA-P on rPFS and OS across the pre-specified 
subgroups was favourable and consistent with the overall study population, except for the subgroup of 
ECOG score of 2.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Abiraterone plus prednisone or prednisolone has been authorised in the EU since September 2011. The 
Applicant states no new ADR has been identified in the post marketing period to date. 
The abiraterone plus prednisone group received therapy for almost twice as long as subjects in the 
placebo group (24 vs. 14 months). To assess the effect of the longer duration of exposure an analysis 
was conducted and reported as the number of events per 100 patient-years (P-Y) of exposure. When 
standardising for exposure (events per 100 P-Y), the rate of adverse events was lower for the AA-P group 
(484) compared with the placebo group (530).  
Without adjustment for treatment duration, the number of subjects with drug-related treatment-
emergent adverse events was higher in the AA-P group compared to the placebo group, 56.3% vs. 44.7% 
and for grade 3-4 events 27.1% vs. 11.1%. In a cross trial comparison, the safety profile of abiraterone 
plus prednisone was broadly consistent with that observed to the previous mCRPC Phase III studies, with 
the exception of Grade 3-4 drug-related adverse events (COU-AA-301: 15.6%, COU-AA-302: 18.2% and 
PCR3011: 27.1%).  
Treatment emergent AEs were reported in 93.5% of subjects in the AA-P group and 92.5% of subjects in 
the placebo group. The most frequently reported events in ≥20% of AA-P subjects were hypertension 
(36.7% versus 22.1%), hypokalaemia (20.4% versus 3.7%) and back pain (18.4% versus 20.4%). No 
new safety signal has been identified. The incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs was higher in the AA-P group 
compared to placebo (63% vs. 48%). The most frequently reported events were related to 
mineralocorticoid excess and included hypertension (20.3% vs. 10.0%) and hypokalaemia (10.4% vs. 
1.3%). A higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive 
population (study 3011).  
Hepatotoxicity is a well-known abiraterone adverse reaction and was observed in the study. It was 
reported in 22.4% of AA-P group and 18.1% of placebo group. The most frequently reported individual 
hepatotoxicity AE were ALT increased (16.4% vs. 12.8%), AST increased (14.6% vs. 11.3%), 
hyperbilirubinaemia (2.8% vs. 0.5%), hepatic enzyme increased (1.2% vs. 0.3%), and blood alkaline 
phosphatase increased (0.3% vs. 1.2%). 
Deaths within 30 days of last dose were similar between arms, 6.7% vs. 6.1%. Marginally more serious 
adverse events were reported in the AA-P group vs. placebo, 27.6% vs. 24.3%.  
Adverse events leading to dose reduction or interruption were reported for 32.2% of subjects in the AA-P 
group and 17.4% of subjects in the placebo group. The reported AEs leading to dose reduction or 
interruption are well known events and listed in section 4.4 of the SmPC. More subjects in the placebo 
group discontinued treatment, 81.4% (61.3% for disease progression) vs.  57.0% (35.0% for disease 
progression).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone as add-on therapy to standard ADT has shown a clinically relevant 
increase in terms of rPFS. Although results are rather immature, OS data shows an early marked result in 
favour of AA-P. These results are consistently supported by favourable results in terms of main secondary 
endpoints which are considered to indirectly reflect the quality of life of patients. 
Even though results are considered per se compelling to conclude about superiority of AA-P vs. ADT alone 
in the proposed target population of mHNPC patients with high-risk characteristics, some uncertainties 
mainly related to the ADT comparator arm, which is not considered the only alternative for all mHNPC 
patients, as well as the premature unblinding of trial preclude from definitive concluding about the place 
in therapeutic of AA-P. 
Acknowledging the limitations of cross trial comparison, the beneficial effects of abiraterone + prednisone 
+ ADT observed in the PCR3011 study appear to be at least as effective as the current docetaxel + ADT 
combination standard of care with the added patient advantage of abiraterone acetate being an oral 
formulation,. Importantly, for an application based on a single pivotal study, the beneficial results seen in 
the PCR3011 study have recently been replicated in the STAMPEDE study. 
Updated OS data with longer follow-up is expected to be provided, however this will not totally clarify the 
question whether it is better to challenge the mPC with AA-P at an early stage or whether on the 
contrary, it is better to delay AA-P administration to the castration-resistant setting. Despite the 
uncertainties about the right sequence, there is no doubt that abiraterone plus prednisone can prolong 
the survival in patients with mCRPC, as previously shown in other studies. In summary, abiraterone plus 
prednisone treatment appears to offer a valuable option for patients newly diagnosed with high risk

metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) delaying the progression disease and likely 
increasing the life expectancy. 
Updated PFS2 data is expected to be submitted by the company at the time of the second IA on OS. 
Additionally, exploratory data from biomarker analysis is expected to be provided by the company as 
soon as available (see letter of recommendations). 
The safety profile of abiraterone plus prednisone is well characterised. In this new setting, no new 
unexpected events have been reported. The overall safety profile of abiraterone plus prednisone in the 
treatment of adult men with newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) and in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is consistent with that known in 
the already authorized conditions for use. Concomitant medications and the underlying condition may 
explain an important portion of the observed AEs. Although it cannot be excluded that a lower dose of 
prednisone did not impact the incidence of hypertension in the pivotal study, adverse events (including 
hypertension) were generally manageable and the benefits outweigh the risks for the claimed indication.  
Overall, the safety profile is considered manageable and well tolerated, based on the frequencies of SAEs, 
AE leading to treatment discontinuation and AES leading to death, with no major differences over 
placebo. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results from trial PCR3011 showed a clinically relevant and significant advantage for patients with 
mHNPC whereas the safety profile of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone remains manageable and 
consistent with the already authorised conditions of use. Considering all favourable and unfavourable 
effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of ZYTIGA plus prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk 
metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) is positive.

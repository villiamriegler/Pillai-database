PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection. 
The solution is a clear and colourless liquid.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Firazyr is indicated for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency.  
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Firazyr is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose for adults is a single subcutaneous injection of Firazyr 30 mg.  
In the majority of cases a single injection of Firazyr is sufficient to treat an attack. In case of 
insufficient relief or recurrence of symptoms, a second injection of Firazyr can be administered after 
6 hours. If the second injection produces insufficient relief or a recurrence of symptoms is observed, a 
third injection of Firazyr can be administered after a further 6 hours. No more than 3 injections of 
Firazyr should be administered in a 24 hour period.  
In the clinical trials, not more than 8 injections of Firazyr per month have been administered.  
Paediatric population 
The recommended dose of Firazyr based on body weight in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 
years) is provided in table 1 below.

In the clinical trial, not more than 1 injection of Firazyr per HAE attack has been administered. 
No dosage regimen for children aged less than 2 years or weighing less than 12 kg can be 
recommended as the safety and efficacy in this paediatric group has not been established. 
Elderly 
Limited information is available on patients older than 65 years of age.  
Elderly people have been shown to have increased systemic exposure to icatibant. The relevance of 
this to the safety of Firazyr is unknown (see section 5.2).   
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.  
Method of administration  
Firazyr is intended for subcutaneous administration preferably in the abdominal area.   
Firazyr solution for injection should be injected slowly due to the volume to be administered. 
Each Firazyr syringe is intended for single use only. 
Refer to the patient information leaflet for instructions for use. 
Caregiver/self-administration 
The decision on initiating caregiver or self-administration of Firazyr should only be taken by a 
physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema (see section 4.4).  
Adults 
Firazyr may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training in subcutaneous 
injection technique by a healthcare professional. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents aged 2-17 years 
Firazyr may be administered by a caregiver only after training in subcutaneous injection technique by 
a healthcare professional. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Laryngeal attacks 
Patients with laryngeal attacks should be managed in an appropriate medical institution after injection 
until the physician considers discharge to be safe. 
Ischemic heart disease 
Under ischemic conditions, a deterioration of cardiac function and a decrease in coronary blood flow 
could theoretically arise from antagonism of bradykinin receptor type 2. Caution should therefore be 
observed in the administration of Firazyr to patients with acute ischemic heart disease or unstable 
angina pectoris (see section 5.3). 
Stroke 
Although there is evidence to support a beneficial effect of B2 receptor blockade immediately 
following a stroke, there is a theoretical possibility that icatibant may attenuate the positive late phase 
neuroprotective effects of bradykinin. Accordingly, caution should be observed in the administration 
of icatibant to patients in the weeks following a stroke. 
Caregiver/self-administration  
For patients who have never received Firazyr previously, the first treatment should be given in a 
medical institution or under the guidance of a physician. 
In case of insufficient relief or recurrence of symptoms after self-treatment or administration by a 
caregiver, it is recommended that the patient or caregiver should seek medical advice. For adults, 
subsequent doses that may be required for the same attack should be administered within a medical 
institution (see section 4.2). There are no data on administering subsequent doses for the same attack 
in adolescents or children.   
Patients experiencing a laryngeal attack should always seek medical advice and be observed in a 
medical institution also after having taken the injection at home. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 milligrams) of sodium per syringe, so it is 
essentially ‘sodium-free.’ 
Paediatric population 
There is limited experience with treatment of more than one HAE attack with Firazyr in the paediatric 
population. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving CYP450 are not expected (see section 5.2). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of Firazyr with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has not been 
studied. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in HAE patients due to possible enhancement of 
bradykinin levels. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For icatibant, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies showed effects on 
uterine implantation and parturition (see section 5.3), but the potential risk for humans is unknown.  
Firazyr should be used during pregnancy only, if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the 
foetus, (e.g for treatment of potentially life threatening laryngeal attacks). 
Breast-feeding 
Icatibant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal blood. 
No effects were detected in the post-natal development of rat pups.  
It is unknown whether icatibant is excreted in human breast milk but it is recommended that 
breastfeeding women, who wish to take Firazyr, should not breastfeed for 12 hours after treatment. 
Fertility 
In both rats and dogs, repeated use of icatibant resulted in effects on reproductive organs. Icatibant had 
no effect on the fertility of male mice and rats (see section 5.3). In a study of 39 healthy adult men and 
women treated with 30 mg every 6 hours for 3 doses every 3 days for a total of 9 doses, there were no 
clinically significant changes from baseline in basal and GnRH-stimulated concentration of 
reproductive hormones in either females or males. There were no significant effects of icatibant on the 
concentration of luteal phase progesterone and luteal function, or on menstrual cycle length in females 
and there were no significant effects of icatibant on sperm count, motility and morphology in males. 
The dosing regimen used for this study is unlikely to be sustained in the clinical setting. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Firazyr has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, lethargy, tiredness, 
somnolence, and dizziness have been reported following the use of Firazyr. These symptoms may 
occur as a result of an attack of HAE. Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they 
feel tired or dizzy. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical studies used for registration, a total of 999 HAE attacks have been treated with 30 mg 
Firazyr administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional. Firazyr 30 mg SC has been 
administered by a healthcare professional to 129 healthy subjects and 236 patients with HAE.  
Almost all subjects who were treated with subcutaneous icatibant in clinical trials developed reactions 
at the site of injection (characterised by skin irritation, swelling, pain, itchiness, erythema, burning 
sensation). These reactions were generally mild to moderate in severity, transient, and resolved 
without further intervention.

Paediatric Population 
A total of 32 paediatric patients (8 children aged 2 to 11 years and 24 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years) 
with HAE were exposed to treatment with icatibant during clinical studies. Thirty-one patients 
received a single dose of icatibant and 1 patient (an adolescent) received icatibant for two HAE attacks 
(in total, two doses). Firazyr was administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg based 
on body weight to a maximum dose of 30 mg.   
The majority of paediatric patients who were treated with subcutaneous icatibant experienced injection 
site reactions such as erythema, swelling, burning sensation, skin pain and itching/pruritus; these were 
found to be mild to moderate in severity and consistent with reactions that have been reported in 
adults. Two paediatric patients experienced injection site reactions which were assessed as severe and 
which were completely resolved within 6 hours. These reactions were erythema, swelling, burning and 
warm sensation.  
No clinically significant changes in reproductive hormones were observed during clinical studies.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
Across repeated treatment in adults in the controlled phase III trials, transient positivity to anti-
icatibant antibodies was observed in rare cases. All patients maintained efficacy. One Firazyr-treated 
patient tested positive for anti-icatibant antibodies before and after treatment with Firazyr. This patient 
was followed for 5 months and further samples were negative for anti-icatibant antibodies. No 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions were reported with Firazyr.   
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
No clinical information on overdose is available. 
A dose of 3.2 mg/kg intravenously (approximately 8 times the therapeutic dose) caused transient 
erythema, itching, flushing or hypotension in healthy subjects. No therapeutic intervention was 
necessary.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used to treat hereditary angioedema; 
ATC code: B06AC02. 
Mechanism of action 
HAE (an autosomal dominant disease) is caused by an absence or dysfunction of C1-esterase-
inhibitor. HAE attacks are accompanied by an increased release of bradykinin, which is the key 
mediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.  
HAE manifests as intermittent attacks of subcutaneous and/or sub mucosal oedema involving the 
upper respiratory tract, the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. An attack usually lasts between 2 to 5 
days. 
Icatibant is a selective competitive antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 (B2) receptor. It is a synthetic 
decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin, but with 5 non-proteinogenic amino acids. In HAE 
increased bradykinin concentrations are the key mediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In healthy young subjects, icatibant administered in doses of 0.8 mg/kg over 4 hours; 1.5 mg/kg/day or 
0.15 mg/kg/day for 3 days, development of bradykinin-induced hypotension, vasodilatation and reflex 
tachycardia was prevented. Icatibant was shown to be a competitive antagonist when the bradykinin 
challenge dose was increased 4-fold.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy data were obtained from an initial open-label Phase II study and from three controlled Phase 
III studies.  
Phase III clinical studies (FAST-1 and FAST-2) were randomized, double-blind, controlled trials and 
had identical designs except for the comparator (one with oral tranexamic acid as the comparator and 
one placebo controlled). A total of 130 patients were randomized to receive either a 30 mg dose of 
icatibant (63 patients) or comparator (either tranexamic acid, - 38 or placebo - 29 patients). 
Subsequent episodes of HAE were treated in an open label extension. Patients with symptoms of 
laryngeal angioedema received open label treatment with icatibant. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
the time to onset of symptom relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Table 3 shows the efficacy 
results for these studies. 
FAST-3 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 98 adult patients with a median 
age of 36 years. Patients were randomized to receive either icatibant 30 mg or placebo by 
subcutaneous injection. A subset of patients in this study experienced acute HAE attacks while 
receiving androgens, antifibrinolytic agents or Cl inhibitors. The primary endpoint was time to onset 
of symptom relief assessed using a 3-item composite visual analog score (VAS-3) consisting of 
assessments of skin swelling, skin pain, and abdominal pain. Table 4 shows the efficacy results for 
FAST-3.  
In these studies, patients on icatibant had a faster median time to onset of symptom relief (2.0, 2.5 and 
2.0 hours, respectively) compared to tranexamic acid (12.0 hours) and placebo (4.6 and 19.8 hours). 
The treatment effect of icatibant was confirmed by secondary efficacy endpoints.  
In an integrated analysis of these controlled Phase III studies, the time to onset of symptom relief and 
time to onset of primary symptom relief were similar regardless of age group, sex, race, weight or 
whether or not the patient used androgens or antifibrinolytic agents. 
Response was also consistent across repeated attacks in the controlled Phase III trials. A total of 237 
patients were treated with 1,386 doses of 30 mg icatibant for 1,278 attacks of acute HAE. In the first 
15 Firazyr treated attacks (1,114 doses for 1,030 attacks), the median times to onset of symptom relief 
were similar across attacks (2.0 to 2.5 hours). 92.4% of these attacks of HAE were treated with a 
single dose of Firazyr.

A total of 66 patients with attacks of HAE affecting the larynx were treated in these controlled Phase 
III clinical trials. The results were similar to patients with non-laryngeal attacks of HAE with respect 
to time to onset of symptom relief. 
Paediatric population 
An open label, non-randomised single-arm study (HGT-FIR-086) was performed with a total of 32 
patients. All patients received at least one dose of icatibant (0.4mg/kg body weight up to a maximum 
dose of 30 mg) and the majority of patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Eleven 
patients were of prepubertal status and 21 patients were either pubertal or postpubertal. 
The efficacy population consisted of 22 patients who had been treated with icatibant (11 prepubertal 
and 11 pubertal/postpubertal) for HAE attack. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to onset of symptom relief (TOSR) measured using a 
composite investigator-reported symptom score. Time to symptom relief was defined as the duration 
of time (in hours) taken for improvement of symptoms to occur by a magnitude of 20%.  
Overall the median time to onset of symptom relief was 1.0 hour (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1 
hours). At 1 and 2 hours post treatment, approximately 50% and 90% of patients experienced onset of 
symptom relief, respectively.   
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the median time to minimal symptoms (earliest time post treatment when all symptoms were 
either mild or absent) was 1.1 hours (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.0 hours). 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of icatibant has been characterized by studies using both intravenous and 
subcutaneous administration to healthy volunteers and patients. The pharmacokinetic profile of 
icatibant in patients with HAE is similar to that in healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability of icatibant is 97%. The time to 
maximum concentration is approximately 30 minutes.  
Distribution  
Icatibant volume of distribution (Vss) is about 20-25 L. Plasma protein binding is 44%.  
Biotransformation  
Icatibant is extensively metabolized by proteolytic enzymes to inactive metabolites that are primarily 
excreted in the urine. 
In vitro studies have confirmed that icatibant is not degraded by oxidative metabolic pathways and is 
not an inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and is not an inducer of CYP 1A2 and 3A4.  
Elimination 
Icatibant is mainly eliminated by metabolism with less than 10% of the dose eliminated in the urine as 
unchanged drug. Clearance is about 15-20 l/h and independent of dose. The terminal plasma half-life 
is about 1-2 hours.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
Data suggest an age-related decline in clearance resulting in about 50-60% higher exposure in older 
people (75-80 years) compared to patients aged 40 years.  
Gender 
Data suggest that there is no difference in the clearance between females and males after correcting for 
body weight.  
Hepatic and Renal Impairment 
Limited data suggest that icatibant exposure is not influenced by hepatic or renal impairment.  
Race 
Information on individual race effect is limited. Available exposure data suggest no difference in the 
clearance between non-White (n=40) and White (n=132) subjects.

Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of icatibant were characterized in paediatric HAE patients in study HGT-FIR-
086 (see section 5.1). Following a single subcutaneous administration (0.4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 
30 mg), the time to maximum concentration is approximately 30 minutes and the terminal half-life is 
about 2 hours. There are no observed differences in the exposure to icatibant between HAE patients 
with and without an attack. Population pharmacokinetic modelling using both adult and paediatric data 
showed that clearance of icatibant is related to body weight with lower clearance values noted for 
lower body weights in the paediatric HAE population. Based on modelling for weight banded dosing, 
the predicted exposure to icatibant in the paediatric HAE population (see section 4.2) is lower than the 
observed exposure in studies conducted with adult HAE patients. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data  
Repeated-dose studies of up to 6-months duration in rats and 9-months duration in dogs have been 
conducted. In both rats and dogs, there was a dose-related reduction in circulating sex hormone levels 
and the repeated use of icatibant reversibly delayed sexual maturation. 
Maximum daily exposures defined by area under the curve (AUC) at the No Observed Adverse Effect 
Levels (NOAEL) in the 9-month study in dog were 2.3 times the AUC in adult humans after a 
subcutaneous dose of 30 mg. A NOAEL was not measurable in the rat study, however, all of the 
findings from that study showed either completely or partially reversible effects in treated rats. 
Adrenal gland hypertrophy was observed at all doses tested in rats. Adrenal gland hypertrophy was 
seen to reverse after cessation of icatibant treatment. The clinical relevance of the adrenal gland 
findings is unknown. 
Icatibant had no effect on the fertility of male mice (top dose 80.8 mg/kg/day) and rats (top dose 
10 mg/kg/day). 
In a 2 year study to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of icatibant in rats, daily doses giving exposure 
levels up to approximately 2-fold that achieved after a therapeutic dose in humans had no effect on the 
incidence or morphology of tumours. Results do not indicate a carcinogenic potential for icatibant. 
In a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests icatibant was not genotoxic.  
Icatibant was not teratogenic when administered by SC injection during early embryonic and fetal 
development in rat (top dose 25 mg/kg/day) and rabbit (top dose 10 mg/kg/day). Icatibant is a potent 
antagonist of bradykinin and therefore, at high dose levels, treatment can have effects on the uterine 
implantation process and subsequent uterine stability in early pregnancy. These uterine effects also 
manifest in late stage pregnancy where icatibant exhibits a tocolytic effect resulting in delayed 
parturition in the rat, with increased fetal distress and perinatal death at high doses (10 mg/kg/day). 
A 2-week subcutaneous dose range finding study in juvenile rats identified 25 mg/kg/day as a 
maximally tolerated dose. In the pivotal juvenile toxicity study in which sexually immature rats were 
treated daily with 3 mg/kg/day for 7 weeks, atrophy of testes and epididymides were observed; the 
observed microscopic findings were partially reversible. Similar effects of icatibant on reproductive 
tissue were seen in sexually mature rats and dogs. These tissue findings were consistent with reported 
effects on gonadotrophins and during the subsequent treatment-free period appear to be reversible.  
Icatibant did not elicit any cardiac conduction change in vitro (hERG channel) or in vivo in normal 
dogs or in various dog models (ventricular pacing, physical exertion and coronary ligation) where no 
associated hemodynamic changes were observed. Icatibant has been shown to aggravate induced 
cardiac ischemia in several non-clinical models, although a detrimental effect has not consistently 
been shown in acute ischemia.

Package Leaflet: Information for the user 
Firazyr 30 mg solution for injection pre-filled syringe 
icatibant 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet: 
1.  What Firazyr is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before you use Firazyr  
3.  How to use Firazyr 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Firazyr 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What Firazyr is and what it is used for 
Firazyr contains the active substance icatibant. 
Firazyr is used for treating the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 2 years and older. 
In HAE levels of a substance in your bloodstream called bradykinin are increased and this leads to 
symptoms like swelling, pain, nausea, and diarrhoea. 
Firazyr blocks the activity of bradykinin and therefore ends the further progression of the symptoms.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Firazyr  
Do not use Firazyr  
- 
If you are allergic to icatibant, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Firazyr: 
- 
- 
if you are suffering from angina (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle)  
if you have recently suffered a stroke 
Some of the side effects connected with Firazyr are similar to the symptoms of your disease. Tell your 
doctor immediately if you notice that your symptoms of the attack get worse after you received Firazyr 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition: 
- 
You or your caregiver must be trained on subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique 
before you self-inject or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr. 
- 
- 
Immediately after you self-inject Firazyr or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr while you 
are experiencing a laryngeal attack (obstruction of the upper airway), you must seek medical 
care in a medical institution. 
If your symptoms are not resolved following one self- or caregiver administered injection of 
Firazyr, you should seek medical advice regarding additional injections of Firazyr. For adult 
patients, up to 2 additional injections may be given within 24 hours. 
Children and adolescents  
Firazyr is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 12 kg because 
it has not been studied in these patients.  
Other medicines and Firazyr 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Firazyr is not known to interact with other medicines. If you are taking a medicine known as an 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example: captopril, enalapril, ramipril, 
quinapril, lisinopril) which is used to lower your blood pressure or for any other reason, you should 
inform your doctor before receiving Firazyr. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor before starting to use Firazyr. 
If you are breast-feeding you should not breast-feed for 12 hours after you have last received Firazyr. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy as a result of your HAE attack or after using 
Firazyr. 
Firazyr contains sodium 
The injection solution contains less than 1 mmol (23 milligrams) of sodium per syringe, so it is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Firazyr 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.  
If you have never received Firazyr previously, your first dose of Firazyr will always be injected by 
your doctor or nurse. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe for you to go home. After discussion 
with your doctor or nurse and after training in subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique, you 
may be able to inject yourself with Firazyr or your caregiver may inject Firazyr for you when you have 
an HAE attack. It is important that Firazyr is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you 
notice an attack of angioedema. Your healthcare provider will teach you and your caregiver how to 
safely inject Firazyr by following the instructions in the Package Leaflet.   
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When and how often should you use Firazyr? 
Your doctor has determined the exact dose of Firazyr and will tell you how often it should be used. 
Adults 
-  The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection (3 ml, 30 mg) injected subcutaneously (under 
the skin) as soon as you notice the attack of angioedema (for example increased skin swelling, 
particularly affecting the face and neck, or increasing tummy pain). 
- 
If you experience no relief of symptoms after 6 hours, you should seek medical advice regarding 
additional injections of Firazyr. For adults, up to 2 additional injections may be given within 24 
hours. 
-  You should not have more than 3 injections in a 24 hour period and if you require more than 
8 injections in a month, you should seek medical advice. 
Children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years 
-  The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection of 1 ml up to a maximum of 3 ml based on 
body weight injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you develop symptoms of an 
angioedema attack (for example increased skin swelling, particularly affecting the face and neck, 
increasing tummy pain).   
-  See section on instructions for use for the dose to inject. 
- 
- 
If you are not sure which dose to inject, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If your symptoms get worse or do not improve, you must seek immediate medical help. 
How should Firazyr be administered? 
Firazyr is intended for subcutaneous injection (under the skin). Each syringe should only be used once. 
Firazyr is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin in the abdomen (tummy).  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
The following step-by step instructions are intended for: 
-

Step-by-Step Instructions for Injection 
1)  General Information 
  Clean the work area (surface) to be used before beginning the process. 
  Wash your hands with soap and water. 
  Open the tray by peeling back the seal. 
  Remove the pre-filled syringe from the tray. 
  Remove the cap from the end of the pre-filled syringe by unscrewing the cap. 
  Put down the pre-filled syringe after unscrewing the cap. 
2a) Preparing the syringe for  
children and adolescents (2-17 years) 
weighing 65 kg or less: 
Important information for healthcare professionals and caregivers: 
Where the dose is less than 30 mg (3 ml), the following equipment is required to extract the 
appropriate dose (see below): 
a)  Firazyr pre-filled syringe (containing icatibant solution) 
b)  Connector (adapter) 
c)  3 ml graduated syringe 
The required injection volume in ml should be drawn up in an empty 3 ml graduated syringe (see table 
below). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: Dosage regimen for children and adolescents 
Body Weight 
12 kg to 25 kg 
26 kg to 40 kg 
41 kg to 50 kg 
51 kg to 65 kg 
Injection Volume 
1.0 ml 
1.5 ml 
2.0 ml 
2.5 ml 
Patients weighing more than 65 kg will use the full contents of the pre-filled syringe (3 ml). 
If you are not sure which volume of solution to extract, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse 
1)  Remove the caps on each end of the connector. 
Avoid touching the ends of the connector and syringe tips, to prevent contamination 
2)  Screw the connector onto the pre-filled syringe. 
3)  Attach the graduated syringe to the other end of the connector ensuring that both connections fit 
securely. 
Transferring the icatibant solution to the graduated syringe: 
1)  To start transfer of icatibant solution, push the pre-filled syringe plunger (on far left of below 
image). 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)  If the icatibant solution does not begin to transfer to the graduated syringe, pull slightly on the 
graduated syringe plunger until the icatibant solution starts to flow into the graduated syringe (see 
below image). 
3)  Continue to push on the pre-filled syringe plunger until the required injection volume (dose) is 
transferred to the graduated syringe. Refer to table 1 for dosage information. 
If there is air in the graduated syringe: 
  Turn the connected syringes so that the pre-filled syringe is on top (see below image). 
  Push the plunger of the graduated syringe so that any air is transferred back into the pre-filled 
syringe (this step may need to be repeated several times). 
  Withdraw the required volume of icatibant solution. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4)  Remove the pre-filled syringe and connector from the graduated syringe. 
5)  Discard the pre-filled syringe and connector into the sharps container. 
2b) Preparing the syringe and needle for injection: 
All patients (adults, adolescents and children) 
 
 
Remove the needle cap from the blister. 
Twist the lid of the needle cap to break the seal (the needle should be still in the needle cap). 
  Grip the syringe firmly. Carefully attach the needle to the syringe containing the colourless 
solution. 
  Screw the syringe on the needle still fixed in the needle cap. 
  Remove the needle from the needle cap by pulling the syringe. Do not pull up on the plunger. 
  The syringe is now ready for injection. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3) Preparing the injection site 
  Choose the injection site. The injection site should be a skin fold on your abdomen approximately 
5-10 cm (2-4 inches) below your navel on either side. This area should be at least 5 cm (2 inches) 
away from any scars. Do not choose an area that is bruised, swollen, or painful.  
  Clean the injection site with a rubbing alcohol pad and allow it to dry. 
4) Injecting the solution 
  Hold the syringe in one hand between two fingers with your thumb at the bottom of the plunger.

Hold syringe between 45-90 degrees angle to skin with needle facing the skin. 
Keeping the syringe in one hand, use your other hand to gently hold a fold of skin between your 
thumb and fingers at the previously disinfected injection site. 
Hold the fold of skin, bring the syringe to the skin and quickly insert the needle into the skin 
fold. 
Slowly push the plunger of the syringe with a steady hand until all the fluid is injected into the 
skin and no liquid remains in the syringe. 
Press slowly so that this takes approximately 30 seconds. 
Release the skin fold and gently pull the needle out. 
5) Disposal of the injection material 
  Discard the syringe, needle and needle cap into the sharp container for throwing away waste that 
might hurt others if not handled properly.

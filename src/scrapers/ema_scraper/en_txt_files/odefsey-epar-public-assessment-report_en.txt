1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Gilead Sciences International Ltd submitted on 29 July 2015 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Odefsey, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 January 2015. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older weighing at least 35 kg infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) without known 
mutations associated with resistance to the non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class, 
tenofovir or emtricitabine and with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV 1 RNA copies/mL (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
tenofovir alafenamide was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0107/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The application concerns a fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet containing 200 mg emtricitabine (FTC), 25 
mg rilpivirine (RPV) corresponding to 27.5 mg of RPV hydrochloride and 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), 
corresponding to 28 mg TAF fumarate. This new FDC (F/R/TAF) results in systemic exposure to the same 
three active substances as provided by the marketed FDC Eviplera. The difference is replacement of TDF with 
TAF, giving lower tenofovir (TFV) plasma levels vs. TDF, but the resulting active substance (TFV diphosphate; 
TFV-DP) is the same. 
TAF was a new active substance in the EU at the time of filing the application dossier for F/R/TAF. Both FTC 
(Emtriva) and RPV (Edurant) are well established licensed agents in the EU and both are already available in 
other FDC presentations that include TDF. The applicant provided a full application dossier. Fundamentally, 
the application is based on a pivotal clinical bioequivalence study (GS-US-366-1159) that compares F/R/TAF 
to each of the marketed RPV 25 mg tablet (Edurant) and to Genvoya (E/C/F/TAF; recently reviewed and 
given a positive opinion by the CHMP). This bioequivalence (BE) study is intended to bridge the safety and 
efficacy documented for each of Edurant and Genvoya to F/R/TAF.  
Some relevant studies that are specific to the intended FDC are: 
- 
- 
- 
The pivotal BE study (GS-US-366-1159) 
The FDC food effect study (GS-US-366-1651) 
A DDI study with the FDC and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (GS-US-366-1689) 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg of emtricitabine (FTC), 25 mg of 
rilpivirine (as 27.5 mg of the hydrochloride - RPV) and 25 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as 28.0 mg of the 
fumarate – TAF) as active substances.  
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: croscarmellose sodium, lactose (as monohydrate), magnesium stearate, microcrystalline 
cellulose, polysorbate 20 and povidone. 
Film-coating: macrogol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide (E171) and iron oxide black (E172).  
The product is packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene (PP) continuous-
thread, child-resistant cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains silica 
gel desiccant and a polyester coil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Emtricitabine (FTC) 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of emtricitabine active substance has been 
previously assessed through centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisation applications for Emtriva, Truvada, Atripla, Eviplera and Stribild. 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for emtricitabine provided by the applicant are identical to the 3.2.S 
sections submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]-
1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one and has the following structure: 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal x-ray determination. 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in methanol 
and water. Its pKa is 2.65 and the partition coefficient Log P is -0.43. It has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 
5 of the oxathiolane ring. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist: cis-(-)-FTC and cis-(+)-FTC, 
trans-(-)-FTC and trans-(+)-FTC. The synthetic route has been chosen to be stereoselective for the formation 
of the desired cis-(-) enantiomer, emtricitabine. Three polymorphs of emtricitabine have been observed. 
However, the most stable thermodynamically form at room temperature, is consistently produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Emtricitabine is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and followed by 
two options comprising either one or two extra steps. The synthesis was described in sufficient detail.  
The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the formation of 
the desired emtricitabine enantiomer. Five manufacturing sites are involved. Adequate in-process controls are 
applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been shown to consistently produce 
emtricitabine that meets the required quality standards. 
 The active substance packaging is in compliance with EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 11/120 
  
  
 
Specification 
Emtricitabine specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), clarity 
of solution (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and particle size 
(Laser Light Scattering). Analytical methods have been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The 
testing and the proposed limits applied, conform to current ICH guidelines and are acceptable from a 
toxicological and clinical perspective. 
Extended testing during development has demonstrated that only a single polymorphic form results from the 
synthetic process of emtricitabine. Therefore as per ICH Q6A, testing for polymorphic form at release is not 
necessary. Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and therefore, as per ICH Q6, 
microbial testing of the active substance is not required. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 22 commercial scale batches of the active substance from all proposed manufacturers 
were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Thirteen commercial scale and additional pilot scale batches of emtricitabine manufactured using both 
synthetic routes and packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in accordance with the 
ICH Q1A (R2) Guideline under long-term conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) for up to 36 months. Of the above 
batches, eight commercial scale and five pilot batches were stored under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75% 
RH) for up to 6 months. In addition another three batches were stored under intermediate conditions (30 
ºC/65% RH) for up to 12 months. Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content and 
for enantiomeric purity by validated stability indicating methods. Stability data for emtricitabine 
manufactured by both synthetic routes were comparable. The majority of tested parameters remained within 
the specification limits throughout the study period for all three stability conditions. In one isolated batch, 
one degradation product exceeded the specification limit at the last time point (36 months). The same 
degradation product is observed in emtricitabine stored under accelerated conditions. Four batches stored 
under accelerated conditions exceeded the specification limit at 6 months. These data indicate that 
emtricitabine should not be exposed to elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. 
A photostability study was conducted on one batch of emtricitabine. The results showed no significant 
changes in appearance, purity, and impurity content and indicate that emtricitabine is not sensitive to light. 
Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable. 
Rilpivirine (RPV) 
Rilpivirine is currently approved in Eviplera tablets and in other mono-component and combination products. 
The manufacturing methods, specifications and analytical procedures applied to this active substance are in 
accordance with those currently authorised. An ASMF procedure was used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 12/120 
  
  
General information 
The chemical name of rilpivirine hydrochloride is 4-[[4-[[4-[(E)-2-cyanoethenyl]-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-
2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile monohydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C22H18N6∙HCl 
and it has the following structure: 
The chemical structure of rilpivirine was adequately demonstrated by elemental analysis, UV absorption 
spectroscopy, FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and MS. 
Rilpivirine hydrochloride is a non-hygroscopic white to almost white powder, practically insoluble in water at 
neutral, basic and acidic pH and in apolar organic solvents. Its pKa is 5.6 and the partition coefficient log P is 
4.86. The active substance does not contain chiral centres. 
Three polymorphic forms (Form A, Form B and Form C) of rilpivirine were identified and a number of solvates 
can also be formed with a variety of organic solvents. A hydrated form (form D) was also identified. Form A 
was determined to be the thermodynamically most stable polymorphic form and is routinely produced by the 
synthetic process described in the dossier. The solid state properties of the polymorphic forms were fully 
characterised by IR, XRD, DSC, TGA and dynamic vapour sorption. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance was provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF, already approved in the frame of the authorised medicine Eviplera, and it was considered satisfactory. 
Rilpivirine is obtained from two manufacturing sites. 
The active substance is synthesized in five steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents were presented. The E-olefin is formed selectively 
during the process and the minor Z-isomer is limited in the active substance specification. 
The active substance packaging is in compliance with the current European guideline on plastic immediate 
packaging materials CPMP/QWP/4359/03.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identification (IR, 
identification of chloride (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content 
(KF), particle size (laser diffraction), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.) and heavy metals (USP). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set. One genotoxic impurity was found in the 
drug substance and is controlled by suitable tests and limits in an intermediate and the drug substance 
specification in line with ICH M7. 
Skip testing for residual solvents, water content, sulphated ash and heavy metals was justified. 
Omission of testing for polymorphism and palladium was justified. Regarding polymorphism, it was 
demonstrated that Form A was consistently produced in the process and the IR identification method was 
able to discriminate between Forms A, B, C and D. No changes in polymorphic form were observed in the 
primary stability batches stored at different ICH conditions. Palladium testing was omitted based on the batch 
data submitted and the fact that Pd was controlled in-process. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data on 10 production scale batches of rilpivirine hydrochloride were provided. The results 
were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Batch analysis data on development 
batches used in toxicological and clinical studies and manufactured by slightly different synthesis methods 
and tested against the specifications applied at the time of manufacture were also provided. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of rilpivirine hydrochloride from one of the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term (25 °C / 60% 
RH) and intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
°C / 75% RH) in line with the ICH guidelines was provided. Stability studies were  also conducted for 36 
months at 5°C and 30°C / 75% RH. Photostability testing following the ICH Q1B was performed on one 
batch. Results under stressed conditions (oxidative conditions, unbuffered aqueous suspensions and DMF or 
DMF + 0.1 N HCl or DMF + H2O2) were also provided on one batch. 
Active substance specifications are the same at both manufacturing sites and batch results presented 
demonstrated equivalency of the sites with regard to the quality characteristics of the active substance. 
Because of this equivalency, stability data from only one of the manufacturing sites is provided and 
considered acceptable. Nevertheless, the three validation batches manufactured at the second manufacturing 
site were placed on stability and the study protocol was provided, along with a commitment to undertake the 
study up to the end of shelf life. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, water content, particle 
size, microbiological purity and identification of polymorph. Some of the analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. The additional analytical methods (microbiological purity, 
polymorphism and chromatographic purity) and changes in the analytical methods implemented during the

course of the stability studies were adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
The active substance remained unchanged at all time points and under all conditions tested. No significant 
trends were observed for any test parameter under any conditions with the exception of the photostability 
study. A slight increase in particle size at 40°C/ 75% RH was also observed. All tested parameters were 
within the specifications. In solution (0.03% H2O2), the active substance was shown to be prone to oxidation 
and some degradation was observed in 0.1N aqueous NaOH suspensions as well as in DMF or DMF + 0.1 N 
HCl or DMF + H2O2.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period at the proposed storage conditions in the 
proposed container and protected from light. 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF fumarate) 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is propan-2-yl N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-
yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, (2E)-but-2-enedioate (2:1) and has the 
following structure: 
The chemical structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by infrared 
spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 31P), mass spectrometry, elemental 
analysis, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. Tenofovir alafenamide 
fumarate is a BCS Class III compound, with pH-dependent aqueous solubility decreasing with increasing 
basicity. It is soluble at low pH (pH 2.0), sparingly soluble at pH 3.8, and slightly soluble at pH values up to 
8.0. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in 
isopropanol and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral centre 
at the propyloxy- side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the 
carbonylethylamino- substituent has the S-configuration at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is 
located at the phosphorus atom and is in the S- configuration. Enantiomeric purity is monitored  routinely by 
chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has been observed for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.  A single polymorphic form is 
consistently generated through the manufacturing process and this form has been adequately characterized.

The applicant has provided justification for TAF to be considered as a new active substance (NAS) on the 
basis of its unique chemical structure. However, both TAF and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which is a 
known active substance, are prodrugs being metabolised to the same major active metabolite tenofovir (TFV) 
in vivo. Therefore, both active substances share the same therapeutic moiety and as such, TAF is not 
considered a NAS on quality grounds. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route. 
The active substance is synthesized in multiple steps. During the evaluation procedure, the active substance 
starting materials were re-defined to ensure enough of the process is documented in the dossier in line with 
ICH Q11. Commercially available well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual impurities 
were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Critical process parameters were identified using a risk assessment approach. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance packaging is in compliance with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identity (IR, HPLC), 
identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual examination), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP MS), and melting 
point (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (n=16 using the proposed commercial process; 13 of which were commercial scale and 3 
pilot scale) of the active substance, manufactured at both proposed manufacturing sites are provided. 
Additional batch analysis data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics and 
toxicological studies are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Assessment report

The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA).  
Stability 
Stability data on 6 commercial scale batches of active substance from the both proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions at 5 ºC and for 
up to 24 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Results under stress conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH on 5 batches were provided. 
Additionally, results for 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH; for 4 days at 50 ºC / ambient RH; and for 4 days at -
20 ºC were also provided on one batch. 
Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content, and solid state characteristics (XRD 
and melting point). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Degradation products increased under accelerated conditions but remained within the specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indicating that the active 
substance is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the both proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed re-test period at the recommended long-term 
storage condition the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (FTC/RPV/TAF) fixed dose combination tablets are an 
immediate-release dosage form containing 200 mg of emtricitabine (FTC), 25 mg of rilpivirine (RPV) and 25 
mg of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). RPV is incorporated into the finished product as the RPV hydrochloride 
(RPV HCl) salt and TAF as the hemifumarate form (TAF fumarate). FTC/RPV/TAF tablets are grey, capsule-
shaped, film coated tablets, of dimensions 15 mm x 7mm, debossed with “GSI” on one side of the tablet and 
“255” on the other side of the tablet. 
The overall goal of FTC/RPV/TAF tablet development was to create a tablet containing the same established 
doses and physical, chemical, and biopharmaceutical performance of FTC and RPV as currently combined in 
Eviplera and to replace tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with an efficacious dose of TAF, a second-generation 
prodrug of tenofovir, ensuring TAF chemical stability. Formulation and process selection were based on the 
biopharmaceutical properties of FTC, RPV HCl, and TAF fumarate, the chemical stability of TAF fumarate, and 
the physical and chemical compatibility of FTC, RPV HCl and TAF fumarate. This formulation approach was 
based on prior knowledge gained during development of Eviplera tablet. Moreover, this approach enabled the 
use of a RPV final powder blend composition equivalent to that of the RPV layer in Eviplera and an FTC/TAF 
final powder blend composition equivalent to that in Descovy. 
FTC is a BCS Class I compound with high aqueous solubility and high permeability. RPV HCl is a BCS Class II 
compound with low aqueous solubility and high permeability. The RPV HCl particle size was controlled to the 
Assessment report

same specification as used for the authorised Eviplera formulation. TAF fumarate is a BCS Class III compound 
with high aqueous solubility and low permeability and it is susceptible to hydrolysis.  
The physical and chemical compatibility of FTC and TAF fumarate were previously established during 
development of Genvoya and Descovy. Formulations containing FTC and TAF fumarate in combination have 
exhibited excellent physical, chemical, and biopharmaceutical properties, including suitable FTC and TAF 
chemical stability, content uniformity, dissolution, and pharmacokinetic performance. 
The choice of manufacturing process was based on the properties of the active substances. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. or other 
relevant standards except for the film coating material, which is commercially available and tested according 
to an in-house standard. All the components of the coating material comply with the standards in EU 
Regulation 231/2012 or compendial monographs. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The physical and chemical compatibility between TAF fumarate, FTC and excipients was evaluated by 
studying the chemical stability of the prototype FTC/TAF formulation matrices under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC/75% RH) and no incompatibilities were found after 3 months of storage.  
A detailed account of the evolution of the formulation and manufacturing process throughout clinical 
development was presented. The clinical bioequivalence batches were representative of the commercial 
product and were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site. Comparative dissolution data was 
provided. Results of bioequivalence studies demonstrated that the FTC/RPV/TAF tablet is bioequivalent to 
Genvoya as the FTC and TAF comparator, and to Edurant, the single agent RPV comparator. 
Two separate dissolution methods were used to control the final finished product given the chemical 
instability of TAF at low pH and the incomplete dissolution of RPV at high pH. The development of the 
dissolution methods has been discussed and the methods are considered to be acceptable. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution methods was demonstrated.  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The manufacturing development 
has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of experiments (DoE) to identify the 
critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) were 
identified. A risk analysis was performed in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that 
may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the 
prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The results of this initial risk 
assessment supported the evaluation of certain unit operations and process parameters in development 
studies to define the control strategy for the commercial manufacturing process. The critical process 
parameters have been adequately identified. 
The manufacturing process development history and key outcomes of each development step that influenced 
the designated commercial manufacturing process were presented including details of the establishment of 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs), normal operating ranges (NORs), and operating parameter targets for all 
key units operations. 
Although multi-variate experiments (DoE) were carried out for a number of the process development studies, 
no design spaces are claimed. It is intended to operate within the NORs defined for all process parameters 
and unit operations. PARs have been accepted for several parameters but only one parameter at a time may 
be varied from its set-point.

The primary packaging is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a propylene continuous-thread, 
child-resistant cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains silica gel 
desiccant and polyester coil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  multiple  steps:  blending  of  the  active  substance  with 
intragranular/extragranular excipients, fluid-bed granulation/dry granulation and milling, compression, tablet 
film-coating, and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies carried out at 
representative commercial-scale. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Full validation will be carried out 
on commercial scale for at least 3 consecutive batches prior to release the market and a suitable scheme has 
been provided. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
Adequate justification for holding times of bulk intermediates (powder blends, tablet cores, and film-coated 
tablets prior to packaging), has been provided and is discussed in the stability section. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include tests for 
appearance,  identification  (UPLC,  UV),  water  content  (KF),  strength  (UPLC),  degradation  products  (UPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing was presented. 
Batch analysis results from both proposed production sites are provided for seven full or representative 
commercial-scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released to the market based on the above release specifications, through final 
product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on six pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long term (25 
ºC/60 % RH) and intermediate (30 ºC/75 % RH) conditions, and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC/75 % RH), in line with ICH guidelines, was provided. The batches tested were 
manufactured at both commercial manufacturing sites, were representative of those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. In addition, one batch from one 
manufacturing site was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. Stressed studies were carried out to evaluate conditions which may be experienced 
during shipping and handling. Studies were conducted on one batch from one manufacturing site at -20 ºC 
for 14 days and at 50 ºC / ambient humidity or 60 ºC / ambient humidity for 4 days. Additionally, studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 19/120 
  
  
were carried out on FTC/RPV/TAF tablets stored at 25 °C / 60% RH and 30 °C / 75% RH without primary 
packaging for 4 weeks. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  strength,  degradation  products,  water  content,  dissolution  and 
microbiological examination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Stability  data  for  all  batches  of  FTC/RPV/TAF  finished  product  tested  met  the  acceptance  criteria  for  all 
stability  test  attributes  at  all  studied  time  points.  No  trends  were  observed  for  any  of  the  measured 
parameters except for TAF strength and TAF-related degradation products. A slight decrease in TAF strength 
and a slight increase of TAF-degradation products was observed at accelerated conditions. No RPV- and FTC-
related degradation products were observed. Also, the water content of the tablets showed a slight decrease 
upon  storage  as  an  effect  of  desiccant  present  in  primary  packaging  at  long,  intermediate  and  accelerated 
conditions. 
Regarding photostability studies, no significant difference between the dark control and the sample exposed 
to light was observed for any of the measured parameters, except for a slight increase in water content. This 
was  attributed  to  atmospheric  moisture  as  the  study  was  carried  out  on  un-packaged  tablets.  The  data 
confirm that FTC/RPV/TAF tablets are not photosensitive. 
The  quality  attributes  monitored  during  stability  remained  within  the  acceptance  limits  when  tablets  were 
stored  at  -20  °C,  50  °C  and  60  °C  for  short  durations  representative  of  excursions,  and  when  the  tablets 
were stored without primary packaging at 25 °C / 60% RH and 30 °C / 75% RH. No changes to any of the 
measured  parameters  were  observed  other  than  a  slight  decrease  in  TAF  strength  and  a  slight  increase  in 
TAF degradation products at 60 ºC / ambient humidity and 30 °C / 75% RH without protection from primary 
packaging  conditions.  No  RPV-  and  FTC-related  degradation  products  were  observed.  A  slight  increase  in 
water  content  was  observed  at  25  °C/60%  RH  and  30  °C/75%  RH  without  protection  from  primary 
packaging. However, all measured parameters remained within their specification limits. 
Studies on bulk storage of intermediate products were also carried out. The bulk holding times are supported 
by  stability  data.  Satisfactory  information  was  provided  on  containers  and  bulk  transport  conditions  and 
supported by stability data. 
The  comparative  stability  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  stability  of  the  three  active  substances  in 
FTC/RPV/TAF tablets is comparable to the stability in already authorized medicinal products containing these 
active substances. 
Based on available stability data for FTC/RPV/TAF tablets and comparative stability data, the proposed shelf-
life of 24 months without specific storage conditions when stored in the commercial container closure system, 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), is acceptable. 
Appropriate post-approval stability protocol and stability commitments have been provided.

It is confirmed that the lactose monohydrate is sourced from bovine milk from healthy animals in the same 
conditions as milk collected for human consumption. No other ruminant or animal materials are used during 
the process. Lactose monohydrate is therefore excluded from the scope of the note for guidance on 
minimising the risk of transmitting TSE.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The medicinal product is a fixed-dose combination containing three active substances already approved in 
marketed products. The applicant has successfully developed a tablet which separates incompatible 
components whilst ensuring adequate bioavailability of the active ingredients. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The development strategy was to use the knowledge obtained for 
other products containing the same active substances. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD elements in the development of the finished product and the manufacturing 
process. PARs are justified for some manufacturing steps although no design space was claimed. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacology  programmes  have  been  completed  for  each  of  the  components  of  FTC,  RPV  and  TAF, 
comprising of primary pharmacology, secondary pharmacology and safety pharmacology studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Emtricitabine  (FTC)  is  a  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  (NRTI),  and  intracellularly  it  is 
phosphorylated  to  the  active  metabolite,  emtricitabine  triphosphate  which  has  activity  against  HIV  and 
hepatitis B virus.   
Rilpivirine (RPV) is a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that does not require modification 
for  anti-viral  activity.  RPV  binds  to  HIV-1  reverse  transcriptase  (RT),  and  shows  at  least  nanomolar  EC50 
values against wild-type HIV-1 isolates.  
Tenofovir  alafenamide  (TAF)  is  a  prodrug  of  tenofovir  (TFV),  and  after  absorption  TAF  is  converted  to  TFV 
intracellularly,  which  is  phosphorylated  to  the  active  metabolite,  tenofovir  diphosphate  (TFV-DP),  that 
competes with natural 2’-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation by the HIV-1 or HBV reverse 
transcriptase (RT) and, once incorporated, results in chain-termination.  TAF differs from tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate  (TDF)  as  it  is  more  stable  in  human  plasma  than  TDF  despite  rapidly  undergoing  intracellular 
conversion to TFV. Treatment with TAF results in higher levels of TFV-DP in PBMCs and 90% lower circulating 
levels of TFV relative to TDF.

Emtricitabine (FTC) is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, 2′-deoxycytidine. 
Intracellularly, FTC is converted through 3 phosphorylation reactions to its active tri-phosphorylated anabolite 
FTC-TP.   
Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits viral polymerases by direct binding competition with the natural 
deoxyribonucleotide substrate (deoxycytidine triphosphate; dCTP), and after incorporation into DNA, by DNA 
chain termination. Published literature describes that the EC50 of FTC against laboratory adapted strains of 
HIV-1 ranged from 0.001 to 0.62 µM depending on cell type and virus strain used in the assay. With clinical 
isolates of HIV-1, EC50 values ranged from 0.002 to 0.028 µM.   
In vivo animal studies have been completed with FTC or FTC in combination to demonstrate its activity 
against immune deficiency in the macaque monkey. Macaques were infected with the simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and 50 days post-inoculation animals were treated subcutaneously with either 
TFV (20 mg/kg) and FTC (50 mg/kg) or were not given any drugs.  The treated macaques achieved SIV 
levels that were below the limit of detection (ie, < 100 copies/mL of viral RNA), whereas only 1 of the non-
treated macaques showed a decrease in SIV RNA.  SIV levels remained low in all treated animals for up to 6 
months.   
In another study, monkeys were exposed to 14 weekly doses of SHIV (SIV/HIV chimeric virus).  Rhesus 
macaques were injected subcutaneously with TFV/FTC daily, at 2 hours before and 24 hours after the first 
virus exposure or at 2 hours before first virus exposure only.  Twenty of the 21 control animals became 
infected. However, all 6 of animals treated with TFV/FTC daily or before and 24 hours after the first challenge 
were fully protected after 14 challenges.  In the single-dose group, 1 of 6 animals was infected, confirming 
that multiple dose therapy was highly effective at protecting these animals against rectal transmission of HIV.

RPV: 
Rilpivirine (RPV, TMC278) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor that does not require 
modification for antiviral activity. Crystal structures of the binding site between RPV and the HIV-1 RT 
complex revealed that RPV, similarly to other members of the diarylpyrimidine family of inhibitors, binds to 
HIV-1 RT and adapts to the conformational changes in the NNRTI-binding pocket, which may explain the 
increased genetic barrier to the development of in vitro resistance. RPV shows sub-nanomolar EC50 values 
against wild-type HIV-1 group M isolates A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (0.07 to 1.01 nM), HIV-1IIIB (0.73 nM), and 
nanomolar EC50 values against HIV-1 group O isolates (2.88 to 8.45 nM). RPV retained antiviral activity 
against 63.0% (136 of 216) of the HIV-1/HXB2 site-directed mutant (SDMs) carrying single, double, triple 
and quadruple RT mutations. No in vivo pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with RPV.  
TAF: 
Tenofovir alafenamide is hydrolysed to tenofovir (TFV) by the lysosomal carboxypeptidase, Cathepsin A 
(CatA). To investigate the intracellular activity of TAF in lymphoid cells and tissues, CD4+ T lymphocytes and 
monocyte-derived macrophage (MDMs) were isolated from PBMCs from viable donors and extent of CatA 
activity determined by measuring the rate of conversion of TAF to TFV-alanine (Figure 2.1.1).  Level of active 
CatA was similar across all donors, as was the rate of conversion from TAF to TFV-alanine in CD4+ cells. 
Cathepsin A activity was approximately 2-fold greater in MDMs compared with CD4+ T cells.  There was 
conversion of TAF to TFV-DP across both cell types in all donor extracts (Figure 2).   
As shown in Figure 1, TAF is hydrolysed to TFV, and is then metabolised to the active metabolite, TFV-DP, 
which is an inhibitor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV polymerases, and is an inhibitor of HIV-1 RT that competes 
with deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation into nascent DNA and terminates the elongation 
of the viral DNA chain during the process of retroviral reverse transcription, thereby effectively blocking the 
replication and spread of infectious HIV.   
In vitro studies have shown that TAF has effective anti-HIV activity in lymphoid T-cells, primary human 
PBMCs, and macrophages with EC50 values ranging from 3 to 14 nM.  The in vitro activity of TAF against HIV-
1 is 100- to 600-fold greater than TFV and 4- to 6-fold greater than TDF (Robbins et al. 1998).   
In MT-2 cells, TAF shows low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index (SI) of > 10,000). Based on data generated 
with the parent nucleotide TFV, TAF is expected to be active against a wide range of HIV-1 subtypes and also 
against HIV-2.  In addition, TAF is a potent inhibitor of HBV replication, exhibiting in vitro activity comparable 
to that of TDF with an EC50 value of 18 nM.

Following incubation for 4 hours with 1μM TAF, the formation and quantity of intracellular TAF metabolites in CD4+ T cells (A) and MDMs (B) were determined by 
HPLC combined with mass spectrometry. 
The interaction potential of TAF with other CatA inhibitors such as HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) (Study No. 
PC-120-2001) has been evaluated. The HIV PIs DRV, ATV, lopinavir (LPV), and RTV, as well as the 
pharmaco-enhancing agent COBI, did not inhibit CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF up to a concentration of 50 
μM, well above the clinical Cmax of each drug.  In a similar manner, the potential for interaction with HCV PIs 
- TMC-435, BI-201355, MK-5172, GS-9256, and GS-9451 showed little-to-no inhibition of CatA, with IC 50 
values ranging from 25 to >50 μM.  Two irreversible inhibitors of the HCV protease, telaprevir and 
boceprevir, were identified as potent inhibitors of CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF, with IC50 values of 0.3 
and 0.2 μM, respectively.  When adjusted for plasma binding, these IC50 values are 6 to 8-fold below the 
clinical maximum concentration (Cmax) levels observed in patients.

No in vivo work with TAF was conducted. However, this has been completed with the active component of 
TAF, TFV.  Monkeys received a single dose of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled TFV subcutaneously, and the extent of 
TFV in plasma and levels of intracellular TFV and TFV metabolite concentrations were determined. The TFV 
concentration in plasma reached a maximum of approximately 50 µM and declined with a t1/2 of 5 to 7 
hours.  As was seen in the in vitro studies, TFV is efficiently taken up by PBMCs and is metabolised to TFV-
DP, with the intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite TFV-DP reaching 0.9 µM. 
FTV/RPV/TAF: 
No additional studies for the FTC/RPV/TAF FDC have been conducted in animal models in view of the 
extensive clinical experience with the use of FTC, RPV, and TDF, FTC/TDF containing regimens, and the EVG 
(elvitegravir, Vitekta®)/COBI (Tybost®)/FTC/TAF FDC for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. FTC, RPV, and 
TAF/TFV are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1, which all show potent antiretroviral activity against 
diverse subtypes of HIV-1 in vitro. Emtricitabine and TAF/TFV are phosphorylated intracellularly through non-
overlapping pathways, and in combination show no antagonism for the formation of their active metabolites.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability FTC, RPV or TAF (TFV) to affect anti-viral activity of other anti-retrovirals has been explored in 
detail, reviewing in vitro cytotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, off target activity and potential metabolic 
toxicities.  
FTC: 
For FTC, no cytotoxicity was observed in vitro in human PBMC, MT-2, HepG2, CEM, MOLT-4, and Vero cells at 
concentrations up to 100 µM.  FTC was also found to be nontoxic to human bone marrow progenitor cells in 
vitro.   
The potential for mitochondrial toxicity with FTC was evaluated. FTC was incubated with HepG2 cells at 
concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 10 µM for 2 weeks, and MT-2 cells were incubated with FTC at 
concentrations up to 100 µM for up to 8 weeks (Study No. TPI 11963, non-GLP). FTC had no adverse effects 
on cell growth, mitochondrial DNA synthesis, or lactic acid production. Further studies confirmed this finding.   
The inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis was also assessed in an in vitro cell culture assay using Molt-4 
cells (a T-lymphoblast cell line) (Study No. TGZZ/93/0016 and TGZZ/93/0023, non-GLP).  FTC did not reduce 
the ratio of mitochondrial to cellular DNA when tested at concentrations of up to 100 µM after 7 days of 
continuous cell exposure. 
FTC had no significant binding affinity at 19 different receptors (Study No. TPZZ/93/0002, non-GLP), has 
shown little or no direct effect on various isolated muscle preparations (cholinergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, 
and serotonergic), and had no major inhibitory effects on the contractile responses to acetylcholine, 
norepinephrine, serotonin, isoproterenol, arachidonic acid, histamine, bradykinin, and angiotensin II (Study 
No. TPZZ/92/0055, non-GLP). 
RPV: 
RPV has no effect on DNA synthesis by human polymerase α, β or γ when tested at concentrations up to 
1000 μM (Study No. TMC278-1646_0005343, non-GLP). In addition, RPV caused no significant inhibition of 
binding to α- or β-adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, opioid, interleukin or chemokine receptors at 
concentrations up to 10 μM (Study No. TMC278-870219, non-GLP). 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016

RPV (9.1 mg/kg) showed a 20% increase in gastric acidity in the pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acidity 
assay in rats compared to vehicle (Study No. TMC278-NC204[1]). The significance of the small increase in 
gastric acidity is unknown. 
In vitro cytotoxicity of RPV was investigated in a range of cell lines, including HeLa, HepG2, Hep-2, MRC-5 
and A549 (Study No. TMC278-IV2-AVMR, non-GLP). Inhibition of cell proliferation by 50% (expressed as 
CC50) ranged from 16.9-35.6 μM on Day 3 and 5. Inhibition of cell viability was indicated by a reduction in 
growth by 50% (expressed as TC50), and ranged from 31.9->40μM on Day 3 and 5.  
TAF/TFV: 
A range of studies have been completed to examine the potential secondary effects of TAF, utilising studies 
already completed for TFV.   
The effect of the major metabolite of TAF, TFV, and the other prodrug of TFV, TDF, on the inhibition or 
stimulation of binding was investigated against a series of protein targets including neuroreceptors, ion 
channels, transporters, and nuclear receptors, Study No. V2000020). There was no significant inhibition or 
stimulation of ligand by either TFV or TDF, confirming that neither TFV nor TDF significantly interacts with 
any of the 111 protein targets tested. 
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, its stereoisomer GS-7339, TDF, and TFV were investigated in 
resting and dividing human PBMCs following 5 days of continuous drug incubation (Study No. PC-120-2009, 
non-GLP).  The maximum concentrations of drugs used were 100, 100, 50, and 2000 μM, for TAF, GS-7339, 
TDF, and TFV, respectively. TAF doses used in this in vitro study were supra-therapeutic in concentration and 
duration. CC50 values for TAF ranged from 6.8 μM in dividing PBMCs to 25.1 μM in resting PBMCs.  TAF 
showed low cytotoxicity in resting and in dividing PBMCs.   
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, TDF, TFV, and a panel of clinically relevant antiretroviral 
inhibitors were also evaluated in 2 T-lymphoblastoid cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) following 5 days of exposure 
(Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP), TAF showed low cytotoxicity in T-lymphoblastoid cells providing ≥1997-
fold increased selectivity relative to antiviral activity in T-lymphoblastoid cell lines.    Similarly TAF 
demonstrated low cytotoxicity to hepatic cells (Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP). 
Tenofovir alafenamide also showed little to no effect on erythroid and myeloid progenitor proliferation in vitro 
(Study No. PC-120-2016, non-GLP). 
TFV exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity in resting and activated human PBMCs, and in an established T-
lymphocyte cell line, with CC50 values >1 mM.  Similar findings for TFV were observed in HepG2 cells, 
skeletal muscle cells of human origin, and in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs). Similarly, 
TFV has shown no effect on haematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro (Study No. PC-120-2016, non-GLP).  
Overall, TFV has a low order of cytotoxicity in vitro. 
The cytotoxicity of TAF and TFV was assessed in human HEK293T cells transiently expressing OAT1 and OAT3 
(Study No. PC-120-2018, non-GLP). Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of TFV or TAF for 4 days. TAF 
did not interact with the renal organic anion transporters 1 or 3 (OAT1 or OAT3), and TAF exhibited no OAT-
dependent cytotoxicity in human epithelial kidney cells transiently expressing these transporters. In addition, 
the selectivity index (considering CC50 in renal HEK293 cells expressing OAT1 or OAT3 relative to EC50 in 
primary CD4+ T lymphocytes) for TAF (29,000 and 4270, respectively) was much higher than for TFV (14 and 
82, respectively). As a result TAF is unlikely to accumulate in renal proximal tubules in an OAT-dependent 
manner, supporting the hypothesis that it has the potential for an improved renal safety profile. TFV has 
been investigated in a number of in vitro models for renal proximal tubular toxicity, where it was shown to 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 27/120 
  
  
have negligible effects on cell growth and viability (Study No. P4331-00037). In addition, TFV had no effect 
on the integrity of the differentiated proximal tubule epithelium after 10 day incubation in vitro (Cihlar et al, 
2001).  
When primary osteoblasts and PBMCs were treated with TAF doses consistent with human therapeutic 
exposure, comparable TFV-DP levels were achieved (Study No. PC-120-2008).  At these therapeutically 
relevant doses of TAF, there were no in vitro effects on cell viability with primary osteoblasts or PBMCs. 
The impact of TAF on mitochondrial toxicity was assessed. Previous studies have demonstrated a minimal 
effect of TFV on the mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vitro. The potential for TAF to induce mitochondrial DNA 
depletion was evaluated in HepG2 cells (Study No. PC-120-2006, non-GLP).  HepG2 cells treated with TAF 
(0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μM) for 10 days exhibited no significant reduction in mitochondrial DNA compared with 
untreated cells.   
No effect of TFV was seen on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or lactic acid production (a mitochondrial 
marker) in HepG2 human liver cells or in normal human skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) (Study No. P1278-
00042, non-GLP). The results confirm the low potential for TFV to interfere with mitochondrial functions. 
Combinations 
The combination of TFV and FTC was studied for cytotoxicity observed at the highest concentrations tested, 
up to 50 µM TFV and 5 µM FTC (Study No. PC-164-2002, non-GLP).  Cytotoxicity studies were also conducted 
on the combination of TFV and FTC in HepG2 cells to evaluate their potential combined mitochondrial toxicity; 
no cytotoxicity was observed (Study No. TX-104-2001, non-GLP). Similarly, in human renal proximal tubule 
epithelial cells (RPTECs), TFV alone or in combination with FTC was not cytotoxic after 5 days incubation in 
vitro (Study No. PC-164-2002). Mitochondrial toxicity studies conducted in HepG2 cells with FTC and TFV 
alone or in combination indicated that the potential for interference with mitochondrial functions was low 
(Study No. TOX-104-2001). 
Given the lack of effects in the in vitro studies with the individual agents or with other combinations, no 
additional secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted for the FTC/RPV/TAF combination.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
FTC: 
Cardiovascular System: 
In vitro the effects of FTC on cardiac preparations was evaluated using isolated cardiac muscle from rat, 
guinea pigs and cats (Study No. TPZZ/92/0056, non-GLP). Results from these in vitro studies suggested that 
FTC was free of negative cardiac effects at 1 µM. 
No effects on the cardiovascular system were reported in anesthetised dogs administered a cumulative dose 
of 38.5 mg/kg of FTC intravenously over a 1-hour period (Study No. TPZZ/92/0076, non-GLP).  Rats given 
oral doses of up to 250 mg/kg FTC showed no effect on heart rate or blood pressure (Study No. 
TPZZ/92/0057, non-GLP). In addition, there were no abnormalities reported on the ECG data obtained from 
the repeated-dose toxicity studies in monkeys, where AUC exposures were up to 26-fold higher than in 
humans at 200 mg.

Central Nervous System: 
A range of central nervous system effects were examined in a single study conducted with male ICR rats 
(Study No. 477, non-GLP).  Mice (10/dose) were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg 
as a single dose.  FTC did not affect reflex, spontaneous locomotion, motor coordination, anticonvulsant 
activity, pro-convulsant activity or analgesic activity at any dose tested.   
A further two studies in rats examined the effects of FTC on reflexes, analgesic activity and conditioned 
avoidance (Study Nos. TPZZ/93/0001 and TPZZ/93/0119, non-GLP). FTC had no effect on these parameters.  
Respiratory System: 
Effects of FTC on the respiratory system have been examined in mice, rats and dogs.  In mice (Study No. 
TPZZ/93/0001, GLP) and rats (Study No. TPZZ/93/0001, GLP), animals were exposed to up to 1000 mg/kg of 
oral FTC with no effect on respiratory rate at any dose. In dogs (Study No. TPZZ/92/0076, GLP), male beagle 
dogs were intravenously administered FTC at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg (cumulative dose = 38.5 mg/kg) 
over an hour. No changes were observed on respiratory function at any dose.   
Gastrointestinal System: 
Male ICR mice (10/dose) were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg, then given a 
charcoal suspension orally at 1 hour post-dose.  Emtricitabine did not affect GI motility at any dose (Study 
No. 477, non-GLP). 
Renal System:  
Male Long Evans-derived rats were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg and urine 
was collected for 6 hours post-dose.  FTC did not affect urine output, pH, or electrolyte excretion at any dose 
(Study No. 477, non-GLP). 
RPV: 
Cardiovascular System: 
In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with hERG encoding the IKr channel, RPV caused a 
concentration-dependent inhibition of IKr ranging from 10% at 0.1μM (0.037 μg/mL) to 80% at 3 μM (1.1 
μg/mL, Study No. TCM278-CPF730, non-GLP). 
In ex vivo isolated guinea pig right atrium (Study No. TMC278-N168576, non-GLP), RPV caused a 
concentration-dependent decrease of the rate of spontaneous contractions to 86%, 72%, and 44% of 
baseline at 1, 3, and 10 μM (0.369, 1.11, and 3.69 μg/mL), respectively. No effects of the force of 
spontaneous contractions and effective refractory period were noted. In anaesthetised guinea pigs (Study No. 
TCM278-CPF643, non-GLP), RPV (up to 5 mg/kg IV) had no effect on heart rate and mean arterial blood 
pressure. While a trend to an increase in QT interval (+18% compared to +10% in vehicle group) was 
observed after administration of 5 mg/kg, after correction for heart rate using Bazett’s formula, no RPV-
induced effects on QT interval were evident.  
Anaesthetised beagle dogs receiving an intravenous infusion of RPV (5 mg/kg), showed no effects on ECG 
parameters (Study No. TMC278-CPF648, non-GLP). However, effects were noted on systemic vascular 
resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output at the end of the infusion. The interpretation of 
these findings may have been confounded by cardio-haemodynamic effects observed with the vehicle used in 
the study, which contained PEG400. In instrumented, conscious dogs, a single oral dose of RPV had no 
effects on heart rate, blood pressure, systolic pressure rate product, LV dp/dt max, LV dp/dt min, LV dp/dt 
Assessment report

max/pd, cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, and ECG intervals (Study No. TMC278-
CPF654, non-GLP). In addition, telemetered conscious dogs receiving single oral doses of RPV (up to 160 
mg/kg), showed no effects on cardio-haemodynamic or ECG parameters (Study No. TMC278-5555, GLP). 
To investigate the mechanism of the QTc prolongation and of the delayed onset observed clinically after 11 
days of dosing with doses of 75 mg and above, additional non-clinical studies were conducted. The potential 
of RPV to induce pro-arrhythmic effects, in particular Torsade de Pointes (TdP), was also evaluated.  
RPV caused a concentration-dependent block in CHO cells in vitro of IKs from 1 μM (0.37 μg/mL) and above, 
with an IC50 of 3.1 μM (1.15 μg/mL, Study No. TMC278-NC342, non-GLP). In addition, in HEK293 cells, RPV 
at nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 μM (0.037, 0.11, and 0.37 μg/mL) caused 19.1% inhibition of 
IKs at 1 μM (0.37 μg/mL), and 13.6% and 35.5% inhibition of Ito at 0.3 and 1μM (0.1 and 0.37 μg/mL), 
respectively. RPV had no biologically relevant effects on IK1, INa, or ICa,L at 1 μM (Study No. TMC278-NC331, 
non-GLP). 
One mechanism possibly considered responsible for the delayed-onset QTc-prolongation observed in the 
clinical TQT study was inhibition by RPV of the synthesis, assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, and/or 
transport of the hERG channel to the cell membrane. This was investigated in HEK293 cells transfected with 
either wild-type hERG (hERG-WT) or a single mutant channel (hERG-SM, Study No. TCM278-NC330, non-
GLP). RPV caused reduced expression of the hERG-WT on the cell membrane (29% and 36% of control 
expression at 10 and 30 μM, respectively), and therefore appears to have the potential to reduce trafficking 
of the hERG channel. Overexpression of hERG-SM on the cell membrane was observed (146%-213% of 
control values at RPV concentrations between 1-30 μM) indicated that RPV to inhibit the hERG channel. This 
result is in line with that of the patch clamp study with CHO cells expressing the hERG channel (Study No. 
TCM278-CPF730).  
The potential of orally administered RPV to inhibit in vivo trafficking of the hERG channel was evaluated 
through the occurrence of delayed-onset QT-prolongation in a repeat-dose (16 consecutive days) telemetered 
guinea pig model (Study No. TCM278-NC327, non-GLP). The dose of RPV (10 mg/kg/day) was selected in a 
pharmacokinetics study as that giving a Cmax value of approximately 2 times the human Cmax at 75 mg RPV 
once daily (0.466 μg/mL) in a clinical Phase 2b study (C204), which resulted in approximately 10 milliseconds 
QT prolongation in the TQT study (C131). In telemetered guinea pigs, RPV (10 mg/kg, oral, 16 days) had no 
effect on ECG parameters, heart rate and body temperature (Cmax ranged between 0.69-0.91 μg/mL during 
the dosing period).  
In the rabbit arterially-perfused left ventricular wedge model, RPV showed only a marginal potential to induce 
proarrhythmic effects, including a 6% and 9% prolongation of the QT-interval from baseline at concentrations 
of 1 and 10 μM (0.37 and 3.7 μg/mL), respectively. At 10 μM only, the assessment of the potential to induce 
TdP resulted in a marginal score of 0.5 (Study No. TMC278-NC341, non-GLP). 
The potential of RPV to inhibit potassium currents IKr, IKs, and Ito involved in the repolarization phase of the 
cardiac action potential is probably a contributing factor to the observed clinical QTcF prolongation. However, 
inhibition of these potassium currents in the cells expressing their channels is a direct concentration-related 
effect, and can therefore not explain the delayed onset of the QTc prolongation in the clinical TQT study. 
However, additional clinical studies determined that a daily dose of 25 mg RPV was devoid of clinically 
relevant QTcF prolongation.

Central Nervous System: 
In a modified Irwin test conducted in rats, a single oral dose RPV was administered at doses up to 400 mg/kg 
(Study No. TMC278-Exp5560, GLP). Apart from a slight reduction in pupil size 2 hours post-dose in all 
animals, no RPV-related neurological changes or delayed neurotoxicity were observed in this study. 
In dogs, RPV administered via oral gavage was evaluated for behavioural effects in both conscious 
telemetered animals (up to 160 mg/kg, Study No. TMC278-Exp5555, GLP) and in awake instrumented 
animals (20 mg/kg) via cage-side observations (Study No. TCM278-CPF654, non-GLP). RPV did not produce 
overt changes in behaviour or locomotor activity. 
Respiratory System: 
In anaesthetised dogs, intravenous infusion of RPV (5 mg/kg) did not affect respiratory arterial blood 
parameters during the one hour infusion or for up to 3 hours after the end of infusion (Study No. TMC278-
CPF648, non-GLP). Similarly, no effects on respiratory rate and tidal volume were noted in conscious 
telemetered dogs after a single oral dose of RPV (up to 160 mg/kg, Study No. TMC278-Exp5555, GLP). 
TAF: 
In vivo safety pharmacology experiments were conducted using TAF as the monofumarate form (GS-7340-
02) in 50 mM citric acid.  In the in vitro hERG assay, TAF as GS-7340-03 was dissolved in DMSO and diluted 
with HEPES-buffered physiological saline to a final concentration of 0.3% DMSO. 
Cardiovascular System: 
TAF (as GS-7340-03) was evaluated at concentrations of 1 and 10 μM (free base equivalents [fbe]), and 
hERG inhibition was not significant. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of TAF on hERG was estimated to be 
greater than 10 μM (Study No. PC-120-2005, GLP).  
Oral administration of TAF (as GS-7340-02) to conscious instrumented male beagle dogs at doses of 30 or 
100 mg/kg (24 and 80 mg fbe/kg) did not induce pharmacologic effects on heart rate, systemic blood 
pressure, or ECGs (Study No. D2000006, GLP). 
Central Nervous System: 
The effect of TAF on the central nervous system has been examined in GLP Study No. R990188 using male 
SD rats. Animals were treated with single oral doses of TAF (as the monofumarate form) with doses of 0, 100 
or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents [fbe]/kg). There was no evidence of any effect on the 
CNS at any dose tested up to 1000 mg/kg.   
Gastrointestinal: 
SD rats were administered TAF (as GS-7340-02) by oral gavage at doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (0, 80 or 
800 mg fbe/kg).  At the highest dose, the rate of gastric emptying was reduced, although this was not 
observed at 100 mg/kg (80 mg fbe/kg).  A dose of 100 mg/kg was considered to have had no effect on 
gastric emptying or intestinal motility (Study No. R990187, GLP). 
Renal:  
The effect of TAF (as GS-7340-02) on the renal system was evaluated in male SD rats following 
administration of single oral doses of 0, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents [fbe]/kg) 
(Study No. R990186, GLP). Urinary output of calcium was increased at 1000 mg/kg. However, this was 
correlated with an increase in serum calcium concentration and indicated that the kidneys were functioning 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 31/120 
  
  
well in order to reduce the serum calcium load. The no-effect dose for a pharmacological effect on the renal 
system was 1000 mg/kg. 
Combination:  
FTC and TAF had little effect on vital organ systems in safety pharmacology studies. From the cardiovascular 
studies with TAF, there is potential for PR interval to be prolonged, as seen in the 39 week dog study at 
18/12 mg/kg/day. This change was observed to be associated with decreased weight gain, bone and renal 
toxicity, and significant decreases in triiodothyronine (T3). In the safety pharmacology study in dogs, 
however, there was no evidence of PR prolongation or any change in ECG results in doses of up to 1000 
mg/kg.  Results from the clinical thorough QT study also have revealed no cardiac signal. 
RPV has shown a weak potential for QT prolongation in in vitro studies, a finding that was not reproduced in 
vivo in non-clinical species. However, a delayed effect was confirmed in a thorough QT study in healthy 
subjects (Study No. TMC278-TiDP6-C131). At the 25 mg dose of RPV, the observed change in QTcF was not 
considered clinically relevant, and the combination product is not anticipated to exacerbate the small 
cardiovascular effect seen with the 25 mg RPV dose. 
As there has been a comprehensive program for each of the three components in respect of safety 
pharmacology, no studies have been conducted with the combination in accordance with CHMP guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). There is sufficient knowledge of the individual components to assess 
potential overlaps in safety risks, and the results do not warrant additional investigation of the combination. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of  FTC,  RPV,  and  TFV/TAF  were  evaluated  in  vitro 
and  in  a  variety  of  animal  models in  vivo.  In  addition,  the  drug-drug  interaction  profile  was  also evaluated. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  the  FTC/RPV/TAF  FDC  is  discussed  based  on  the  results  of  nonclinical  studies 
completed with the individual agents. Given the lack of remarkable effects in the non-clinical studies with the 
individual  agents,  no  additional  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  FTC/RPV/TAF 
combination. 
Methods of analysis 
TAF: 
The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of TAF were assessed in mouse, rat, 
dog, and monkey.  The in vitro absorption, metabolism, and drug interaction characteristics of TAF were 
studied in appropriate model systems.  Levels of TAF and TFV in rats and dog plasma and PBMCs were 
determined using fluorescence derivitization/HPLC. Additional methods to detect levels of TAF and TFV in 
mouse, rat, rabbit and dog plasma/PMBCs included validated LC/MS/MS methods, and HPLC detection 
methods.  The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TAF were assessed in various species 
following a single oral administration of [14C]TAF, and levels of TAF and its metabolites were measured using 
LSC, HPLC or LC/MS/MS coupled with flow-through detector (RFD). In vitro determination of TAF levels were

in the main determined by LC/MS/MS, with some LC-radio-profiling.  Induction potential of TAF on CYP 
activity measured mRNA levels using qRT PCR methods.  
Absorption  
FTC: 
No in vitro permeability studies have been carried out with FTC, as FTC shows high, dose-independent 
bioavailability in vivo in mice and monkeys. Single-dose pharmacokinetics of FTC has been studied in mice, 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. FTC was rapidly and well absorbed with oral bioavailability ranging from 58% 
to 97% over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg/kg. 
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC were derived as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice (80 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX109; IUW00701; TOX599; TOX628), in rats (60 to 
3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX108; TOX097), and monkeys (40 to 2000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX600; 
TOX627; TOX032) dosed for periods of 3 days to 104 weeks. There were no significant differences in 
pharmacokinetics following single and multiple dosing. Exposure to FTC (Cmax and AUC) increased 
approximately proportionally with dose and was similar between males and females. 
RPV: 
The transepithelial permeability of RPV was intermediate in human colon carcinoma-derived (Caco-2) cells 
(Study Nos. TMC278-TiDP6-JRF [FK4155], TMC278-NC104). Passive transcellular diffusion was proposed as a 
mechanism for RPV intestinal absorption. RPV was not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). However, RPV 
showed P-gp inhibitory properties with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 9.2 μM (3.4 
μg/mL). Therefore, inhibition of transepithelial permeation of P-gp substrates by RPV cannot be excluded, but 
is unlikely to be clinically significant at the intestinal absorption level. 
After oral administration of RPV (base form), the absolute oral bioavailability of RPV was 32%, 31%, and 
24% in rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively. Adding citric acid in the formulation administered to rats and 
dogs usually increased the exposure, showing that the absorption of RPV is pH-dependent in these species as 
in humans. 
After oral administration of RPV (base and HCl forms), peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were generally 
reached rapidly (~1 hour) followed by a decline at lower dose levels, whereas at higher dose levels, the 
plasma profiles showed a plateau until at least 8 hours in all species. Across the dose range studied and 
species including humans, plasma concentrations of RPV increased dose-proportionally or more often less 
than dose-proportionally, due to low solubility. At very high dose levels in animals, there was exposure 
saturation and no further increase in exposure was seen. Exposure in female mice and rats was generally 
higher than in males.  
TAF: 
In vitro: The permeability of TAF was examined using Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-120-2037).  TAF was 
applied to monolayers at 10, 100, and 1000 µM. TAF showed a dose dependent increase in forward 
permeability and a decrease in efflux ratio indicating saturable efflux transport. Addition of the efflux 
transport inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) diminished the efflux ratio and increased the permeability.   
Mouse: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in mice.   
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 33/120 
  
  
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in mice, TAF/TFV were evaluated following administration of TAF by 
dosing either GS-7340-02 or GS-7340-03 to male CD-1 mice or GS-7340-03 to both male and female 
001178-W mice via oral gavage (Study Nos. AD-120-2014 and AD-120-2016).   
Tenofovir exposure increased with the increase in dose and was greater than dose proportional between 10 
to 100 mg/kg (Table 1).  Gender differences in plasma TFV levels were less than 2-fold in Cmax and AUC0-t 
values (Table 2).  The pharmacokinetic profiles for the 2 different fumarate forms of TAF were observed to be 
generally similar. 
Table 1.  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of GS-7340-02 and GS-
7340-03 to Male CD-1 Mice 
Table 2.  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of GS-7340-03 to 001178-
W Wild type Mice 
GS-7340-02 was administered by oral gavage for up to 14 days to male and female mice at a dose of 100, 
500, or 1000 mg/kg/day (Study No. TX-120-2006).  Due to early death for animals given 500 or 1000 
mg/kg/day, only the 100 mg/kg/day dose group was evaluated.  GS-7340 at 100 mg/kg/day corresponded to 
a Day 14 Cmax of 27.1 and 2.89 ng/mL for males and females, respectively; the AUC0-24 could not be 
calculated due to the lack of a distinct elimination phase. GS-7340 rapidly converted to its metabolite, TFV. 
There were no significant differences in TFV pharmacokinetic profiles between males and females. 
Following daily administration of GS-7340-02 to mice via oral gavage for at least 13 weeks at doses of 0, 10, 
30, and 100 mg/kg/day, the pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and TFV were determined (Study No. TX-
120-2007).  Exposure to TFV increased with the increase in GS-7340-02 dose from 10 to 100 mg/kg/day. 
The increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were generally greater than proportional between the 10 to 100 mg/kg/day 
dose levels. Gender-based differences were less than 2-fold in TFV Cmax and AUC0-t values. There was no sign

of accumulation of TFV after multiple dosing, and there is rapid and extensive conversion of TAF to TFV after 
oral administration in mice. 
Rat: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in rats.   
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats, the two forms of TAF (GS-7340-02 and GS-7340-03) were 
again compared, as was the exposure to TFV between TAF and TDF (Study Nos. R990130, AD-120-2015, and 
R2000065).  TAF was rapidly absorbed and generation of the major metabolite TFV was observed with a Tmax 
of less than 1 hour (Table 3).  TFV exposure increased in a greater than dose proportional manner.  There no 
significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two forms of TAF, GS-7340-02 and GS-
7340-03.   
Table 3.  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters following a Single Dose of GS-7340-02 and GS-
7340-03 to Male Sprague-Dawley Rats 
In a comparison between exposure of TFV generated due to TAF or TDF (Study No. R20000065), rats were 
treated orally with a single dose of 400 mg/kg of TAF (GS-7340-02) or TDF.  The plasma Cmax and AUC for 
TFV were 2- to 3-fold higher with 400 mg/kg TAF compared to 400 mg/kg TDF. 
The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of TFV was determined during the course of a 28 day oral gavage toxicity 
study in adult male and female albino rats following daily administration of either 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100 or 400 
mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. R990182). A greater than dose proportional increase in exposure was 
observed.  There was no evidence of accumulation.  
In a 26-week toxicology study, GS-7340-02 was administered once daily at doses of 0 (vehicle only), 5, 25 
and 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of TFV were determined on Day 
1 and during Weeks 13 and 26 (Study No. TOX-120-001). No consistent differences in plasma 
pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and female rats. Mean tenofovir Cmax and AUC values 
increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 to 100 mg/kg/day.  Mean TFV AUC obtained on Day 1 
was slightly lower than that measured during Weeks 13 and 26, which suggested that there was a slight 
accumulation of tenofovir with repeat dosing. 
Dog: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in dogs.  
In Study No. 99-DDM-1278-001-PK, the effect on pharmacokinetic parameters due to changes in the stereo 
configuration, fumarate form, food, and the route of administration was examined. In this study Beagle dogs 
were administered TAF as a single IV bolus (GS-7340-02 [6.3 mg/kg]), or oral administration (TAF as free 
base [18.0 mg/kg], its diastereomer GS-7339 [18.0 mg/kg], the mixture GS-7171 [16.0 mg/kg], or GS-
7340-02 [4,8, 5.0, and 20 mg/kg under fasted and 5.0 mg/kg under fed conditions]). Following oral 
administration, TAF and its diasteroisomer were rapidly absorbed and eliminated with a t max of less than 0.5 
h and t½ ranging from 0.2-0.9 h.  The plasma exposures to the intact prodrugs were similar when TAF or 
Assessment report

Page 35/120 
  
  
 
GS-7339 were dosed separately. However, when the isomeric mixture, GS-7171, was dosed, the exposure to 
GS-7339 was approximately 3-fold higher than TAF.  TFV exposure was similar for both diasteroisomers, 
although exposure in PBMCs was higher following dosing with TAF than with GS-7339.  The effect of food led 
to a decrease in overall plasma exposure of TFV and TAF (2.5 fold).   
When male Beagle dogs were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg TAF, there was rapid absorption and 
elimination, t max was less than 0.5 h and t½ ranged from 0.2-0.9 h. The pharmacologically active metabolite, 
TFV-DP was the major metabolite in liver achieving a Cmax of 126 µM at 4.0 hours post-dose. 
Following daily oral administration of 8.29 mg/kg TAF for 7 days to male Beagle dogs, the plasma and liver 
pharmacokinetic profiles were determined on day 1 and 7 (Study No. AD-120-2033). TAF was rapidly 
absorbed and exhibited a short terminal half-life (t½) of 0.3 hours in plasma on both Day 1 and 7.  The rapid 
disappearance of TAF was accompanied by an increase in TFV.  Tenofovir was the major metabolite detected 
in plasma achieving a maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1.47 and 2.12 μM on Day 1 and 7, 
respectively. The pharmacologically active diphosphate metabolite, TFV-DP, was efficiently formed in dog 
livers achieving concentrations of 242 and 153 μM at 4.0 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 7, respectively. 
The plasma PK of TAF and TFV and TFV levels in PBMCs were determined during the course of a 28-day oral 
gavage toxicity study in adult male and female beagle dogs following daily administration of either vehicle, 
0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. D990175-PK).  Repeat dosing at 10 mg/kg/day 
resulted in nonlinear pharmacokinetics between Days 1 and 28 with TAF median AUC values of 0.454 and 
0.985 μg·h/mL, Cmax values of 582 and 1280 ng/mL, and t½ λz values of 18 and 23 minutes, respectively. 
The TFV Cmax values appeared to be linear with increasing dose as well as repeat dosing. The TFV t½ was 
estimated to be 37 h and substantial accumulation of TFV was observed after repeat dosing. The TFV levels in 
PBMCs were not linear with increasing dose; however, a linear correlation was observed between TFV levels 
in PBMCs and corresponding trough plasma concentrations. PBMC concentrations were approximately 100-
fold higher than corresponding plasma concentrations. 
In a 9-month toxicology study in dog, GS-7340-02 was administered once daily at doses of 0, 2, 6, and 18 
mg/kg/day (Study No. TOX-120-002). The dose of 18 mg/kg/day was decreased to 12 mg/kg/day on Day 2 
of Week 7 for males and Day 2 of Week 8 for females due to severe clinical signs and reduced body weight 
and food consumption. The concentrations of GS-7340 and tenofovir in plasma samples and total TFV in 
Week 39/40 PBMC samples were determined.  GS-7340 was rapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir 
following oral dose administration, with peak plasma concentrations of GS-7340 and tenofovir occurring at 
0.5 and 1 hour post-dose, respectively. GS-7340 was eliminated rapidly from the plasma with a terminal 
phase half-life of less than 1 hour.  The median t½ of tenofovir was estimated to be in the range of 25 to 31 
hours on Day 1. The plasma pharmacokinetics of GS-7340 and tenofovir were comparable between male and 
female dogs after oral administration. Plasma Cmax and AUC values for TAF increased more than 
proportionally over the dose range of 2 to 18/12 mg/kg/day.  The plasma TFV C max and AUC increased 
roughly dose proportional.  There was some accumulation of tenofovir following repeat dosing (~3-fold). 
Tenofovir concentrations in PBMCs were measurable at 24-hour post-dose for all dose groups. The median 
terminal phase half-life of total tenofovir in PBMCs was estimated to be 31 hours (similar to the tenofovir 
plasma estimate) from the recovery animals with PBMC concentrations measured up to 72 hours. Dose-
normalized PBMC mean AUC values of total tenofovir increased more than dose proportionally during Week 
39/40.

Monkey: 
Single dose pharmacokinetics for TAF and TFV, and TFV in PBMCs was determined using rhesus monkeys 
administered single oral doses of GS-7340-02 at 0.5, 5.0, and 50 mg/kg (Study No. P2000087).  Tenofovir 
alafenamide and TFV levels increased rapidly with t max values of approximately 0.5 and 1 hour, respectively 
(Table 4).  Levels of TFV in PBMCs were also detected, levels of TFV persisted in PBMCs for up to 96 h and 
persisted to a higher extent to samples treated with acid phosphatase suggesting that a significant proportion 
of TFV-related material in PBMCs was in phosphorylated forms (Table 5).

7340-02 to Rhesus Monkeys 
Table 5.  Concentrations of TFV in PBMCs from Monkeys Dosed with GS-7340-02 
Following daily oral administration of GS-7340-02 at 0, 3, and 30 mg/kg/day or TFV at 15 mg/kg/day for 28 
days, pharmacokinetic profiles of TAF and/or TFV were determined on Day 1, Day 14 and Day 28 (Study No. 
P2000114-PK). No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were found between males and 
females. The pharmacokinetic parameters for TFV were dose linear on Day 1 but were greater than dose-
linear on Day 28 after oral administration of GS-7340-02. There was no statistically significant accumulation 
of TFV following repeat dosing of either GS-7340-02 or TFV. The intracellular TFV concentrations in PBMCs 
were determined from the 30 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 dose group where 72.3 and 27.2 µg/mL were detected 
on Day 14 and Day 28, respectively. 
FTC/RPV/TAF: 
With respect to potential drug interactions within the combination that could affect absorption, FTC and RPV 
shows high passive permeability and is unlikely to be affected when administered with TAF. While TAF is an 
efflux substrate in the intestine, absorption is unlikely to be affected by FTC as intestinal efflux transport is 
not inhibited by FTC. Inhibition of P-gp by RPV observed in vitro is unlikely to be clinically relevant as RPV did 
not affect plasma exposure to P-gp substrates including digoxin and TAF in clinical drug interaction studies 
(TMC278IFD1001 and GS-US-120-1554). Although formal non-clinical studies of the absorption kinetics of 
the FTC/RPV/TAF FDC have not been conducted, comprehensive clinical studies on the combination have 
been performed.

Distribution 
FTC: 
The protein binding of FTC was very low (<5%) in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma (Study No. 
TBZZ/93/0025). The tissue distribution of [14C]FTC was characterised in rats and cynomolgus monkeys after 
a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg (Study Nos. TOX092 and TOX063, respectively).  Distribution was extensive 
and rapid; levels were detected within 1 h post oral administration.  The highest concentration of FTC was 
found in the kidney and the liver. There was no indication of FTC binding to melanin. Concentrations in CNS 
tissues were 2-10% of the concentration in plasma. There was no sign of FTC accumulation and elimination 
was rapid. No radioactivity remained at 72 hours post-dose.   
Pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC in pregnant animals appeared to be generally similar to those reported 
for non-pregnant animals. 
RPV: 
RPV was extensively bound to plasma proteins in all species and the plasma protein binding was found to be 
concentration independent. Plasma protein binding values ranged between 99.08% and 99.97% (Study No. 
TMC278-NC112). RPV was extensively bound to human albumin (99.5% at the physiological protein 
concentration of 4.3% and irrespective of the RPV concentration) and to lesser extent to α1-acid glycoprotein 
(48.8% at the physiological protein concentration of 0.07% and a RPV concentration of 1 μg/mL). The rank 
order of blood to plasma concentration ratio in all species was monkey > dog > rat > man > guinea pig > 
rabbit > mouse and ranged from 0.96 to 0.58. The distribution of RPV to red blood cells (RBCs) was limited in 
all species tested. 
In pigmented Long Evans rats and pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, the tissue distribution of [14C]RPV base 
and its metabolites after a single dose was rapid and extensive (Study Nos TMC278-NC108 and TMC278-
NC109). The highest concentrations of radioactivity were measured in the liver, adrenal gland, brown fat, and 
kidney. In pigmented tissues, the radioactivity decreased more slowly than in the other tissues and was still 
quantifiable 14 days postdose. Tissue to blood AUC0–336h ratios were 146 (uveal tract), 18 (brain meninges) 
and 15 (pigmented skin). Although levels in pigmented tissues at 14 days postdose still represented about 
20% of corresponding peak levels, radioactivity levels decreased from 4 or 24 hours onwards. There was no 
evidence of undue retention and irreversible binding of RPV and its metabolites to melanin. In pregnant rats 
(Study No. TCM278-NC109), AUC0–8h values in the placenta and in whole fetuses were 0.95- and 0.64-fold 
the AUC0–8h value of maternal blood, respectively, suggesting that the placenta is only a partial barrier for 
RPV and its metabolites. 
TAF/TFV: 
The extent of binding of TAF to plasma protein was determined using dog and human plasma only (Study No. 
AD-120-2026).  Rat plasma was not included as TAF is highly unstable in rat plasma due to the presence of a 
high number of esterases. Protein binding of TAF was moderate in dog and human plasma with the percent 
unbound values of 48.0% and 46.8%, respectively. The in vitro values are slightly higher than those 
observed using ex vivo samples from TAF treated humans which ranged from 14 – 23%.  For the use in the 
interaction studies, the percentage of unbound TAF was round up to be 20%.   
The protein binding of TFV has been determined in human plasma and serum using centrifugal ultrafiltration 
(Study No. P0504-00039.1). Percent of unbound TFV was 99.3 ± 3.3% in human plasma, and 92.8 ± 3.6% 
in human serum. Tenofovir therefore showed very low protein binding in either human plasma or serum.

Extensive tissue distribution studies with TAF were completed using mice, rats and dogs.   
Male CD-1 mice were treated with a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011).  Most 
tissues reached maximum concentration by 1 hour postdose. The tissues showing the highest maximum 
concentrations of radioactivity, excluding GI tract, included liver, gall bladder, urinary bladder, diaphragm, 
kidney cortex, kidneys, and kidney medulla.  The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were testis, brain 
cerebrum, fat (abdominal), spinal cord, and brain medulla. Similar distribution profiles were seen in male C57 
Black (pigmented) mice. More persistent exposures in eye lens, eye uveal tract, and eyes were observed in 
CD57 black mice compared to CD-1 mice, although there was no indication that there was a difference in 
distribution between pigmented and non-pigmented skin, or that TAF was more preferentially distributed to 
melanin-containing tissues. 
Male SD or Long Evans rats were administered oral 5 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study AD-120-2020). There was rapid 
distribution to most tissues, both to pigmented and non-pigmented rats. The tissues showing the highest 
maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, kidney(s), kidney medulla, and liver. The 
tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain olfactory lobe, seminal vesicle(s), eye vitreous humour, 
thymus, eyes, testes, and harderian gland for Sprague-Dawley rats and bone, brain olfactory lobe, seminal 
vesicle(s), fat (abdominal), muscle, eye vitreous humour, and eye(s) for Long Evans rats. As there was no 
indication that there was any difference in distribution between pigmented and non-pigmented animals, 
binding to melanin was unlikely.   
The distribution of TAF and TFV in pregnant and lactating animals has been evaluated. In pregnant rats, 
rabbits and monkeys the extent of placental transfer of TAF and TFV was measured during the embryo-fetal 
developmental studies. In rats, there was a clear increase in TFV exposure with increasing dose of TAF 
(Study Nos. TX-120-2001 and TX-120-2002). Multiple dosing in the dose-range finding study showed signs of 
accumulation of TFV, however this was not seen in the definitive study.   
In rabbits, there was an increase in exposure to TAF and TFV with increasing dose, with no evidence of 
accumulation (Study Nos TX-120-2004 and TX-120-2005).   
In the monkey, the extent of placental transfer of TFV following subcutaneous administration was determined 
in pregnant rhesus monkeys (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-005). Placental transfer of TFV appeared to be 
significant with a fetal/maternal serum concentration ratio of 0.17 ± 0.07 (mean ± SD) at approximately 30 
minutes post-dose. 
In immature rhesus monkeys (newborn to 12 months old) administered with TFV subcutaneously (30 mg/kg, 
Study No. 96-DDM-1278-005), Cmax was higher in younger animals, likely a result of a gradual increase in 
clearance from birth to 1 year. It is therefore expected that younger monkeys had higher TFV exposure at an 
equivalent dose. It is likely that newborn monkeys lack the anion transport system responsible for tubular 
secretion of TFV. 
FTC/RPV/TAF: 
Drug interactions, within the FTC/RPV/TAF combination, that affect distribution would not be expected from 
the data available. Interactions through binding displacement would not be anticipated. While plasma protein 
binding is high for RPV and moderate for TAF, the binding was very low for FTC and TFV. Therefore, 
interactions through binding displacement would not be anticipated.

Metabolism 
FTC: 
FTC is highly metabolically stable in vitro and in vivo, and is not subject to significant metabolism by CYP 
enzymes. Generation of a minor (~1%) sulfoxide metabolite (M1 and/or M2) was catalysed by CYP3A4, and 
inhibitor studies suggested that at least one other enzyme, possibly flavin-containing monooxygenase, may 
play a role (Study No. 15396 v1). A minor direct glucuronide metabolite, M3, was also detected.   
FTC was not extensively metabolised and is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug by renal excretion in 
mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Over 90% of the radioactivity in mouse and rat urine and 64% of the 
radioactivity in monkey urine was unchanged drug. Only trace levels of metabolites were found in faeces 
(Study Nos. TEIN/93/0015, TEIN/93/0016, TOX063).  In all 3 species, metabolism accounted for only a minor 
percentage of FTC elimination. FTC is subject to Phase I metabolism (oxidation to a diastereomeric sulfoxide) 
and to direct conjugation (glucuronidation of hydroxymethyl group) as minor metabolic routes. 
RPV: 
In vitro, the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the biotransformation of RPV. Therefore, some effects 
of drugs modulating CYP3A4 enzyme activity on plasma concentrations of RPV were expected in humans. 
Such effects were seen in drug-drug interaction trials with CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin and rifabutin, 
which both decreased the exposure of RPV, and with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, which 
increased the exposure of RPV. 
A large number of RPV metabolites were identified in the in vivo studies in mice, rats, dogs, and humans 
(TMC278-NC190, TMC278-NC113, TMC278-NC114, and TMC278-NC157). RPV is metabolized via Phase I and 
Phase II reactions and the most important pathways are hydroxylation and glutathione conjugation. In mice, 
oxidation of RPV and, to a lesser extent, glutathione conjugation, were the predominant pathways. In rats, 
the glutathione conjugation pathway predominated, whereas in dogs and man, oxidation of RPV was 
predominant. No unique human metabolites were observed. In plasma of animals and human, unchanged 
RPV was more abundant than all metabolites combined. In mice, the predominant metabolites in faeces were 
M41 and M42, accounting for up to 18 and 26% of the dose respectively, and M25 in urine (up to 1.6% of the 
dose, Study No. TMC278-NC190). In rats, M47 was the predominant metabolite (up to 4% of the dose) in 
faeces. In urine, only M17 and M18 were detected at low levels (1.1 and 0.45% respectively, Study Nos 
TMC278-NC113 and TMC278-NC145). In dogs, M33, M42 and M44 were the most abundant metabolites in 
faeces (8.7, 5.3 and 4.3% respectively), and only minor metabolites were detected in urine (Study No. 
TMC278-NC114). In humans, the predominant faecal metabolite was M42, accounting for 16% of the dose 
(Study No. TMC278-NC157/TMC278-NC119). In urine, the only Phase I metabolite detected was M30 (0.03% 
of the dose).  
TAF: 
Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further phosphorylated to the 
anabolites, TFV-MP and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active form.   
The applicant has proposed a possible metabolism pathway based upon the findings from mice, rats, dogs 
and humans (Figure 3.4.1). TAF is also subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further 
phosphorylated to the anabolites, tenofovir-monophosphate and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the 
pharmacologically active form (Figure 3).

Figure 3.  Proposed metabolism pathway for TAF 
In vitro Metabolism:  
The potential for CYP enzymes to metabolise TAF was assessed by incubating TAF with 6 individual bacterially 
expressed human CYP enzyme preparations co-expressed with human NADPH CYP reductase (Study No. AD-
120-2004). Metabolism of TAF was not detected by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP 2D6.  
Tenofovir alafenamide was slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 at a rate of 1.9 min-1 which was 26.6% of the 
positive control, testosterone. 
Intracellular metabolic activation of TAF in PBMCs or other lymphatic tissues involves conversion to TFV by 
cathepsin A.  In contrast to PBMCs, TAF was primarily hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in primary 
hepatocytes. Tenofovir is then further phosphorylated to TFV-DP by cellular nucleotide kinases.

The in vitro activation of TAF in human primary hepatocytes was evaluated and compared with that of TDF 
and TFV (Study No. AD-120-2017). Following a 24-hour continuous incubation of primary hepatocytes with 5 
µM TAF, TDF, or TFV, the levels of GS-77938 increased to 1,470, 302, and 12.1 pmol/million cells illustrating 
that incubation with TAF resulted in 5- and 120-fold higher intracellular levels of GS-77938 compared to TDF 
and TFV, respectively. 
The in vitro metabolism of [14C]TFV was studied in dog plasma, in control and induced (Aroclor 1254) rat liver 
microsomes, and also in dog liver and intestinal S9 fractions (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-003).  Tenofovir was 
recovered unchanged under all conditions: no metabolites were detected in either rat microsomal 
preparation, with or without the addition of NADPH cofactor. There was no evidence of chiral inversion either.  
In vivo Metabolism: 
The metabolic profiles of TAF were determined in plasma, urine, faeces, kidney, liver, and nasal turbinate 
from mice (Study No. AD-120-2012); in plasma, urine, bile, and faeces from rats (Study No. AD-120-2021); 
and in plasma, urine, bile, faeces, bone, and liver from dogs (Study No. AD-120-2008).  The metabolite 
profiles were also determined in human plasma, urine, and faeces following administration of a single oral 
dose of [14C]TAF (Study No. GS-US-120-0109).  The findings from these studies are summarised in Table 
3.4.1 below.   
TFV accounted for a majority of drug related material in plasma, urine, and faeces from all species except for 
human plasma, in which uric acid (M27B) was the predominant metabolite accounting for 73.9% of the total 
AUC over 96 hours.  Uric acid is also detected to a large extent in mouse plasma (19.4%).  M18 was the 
major metabolite in rat bile accounted for 63% of total radioactivity recovered in bile.  M18 and its oxidised 
metabolite, M16 were the major metabolites in dog bile accounted for 29 and 38% of total radioactivity 
recovered in bile. Various oxidative metabolites were found in dog bile.  No metabolites unique to human 
were observed. 
The extent of TFV transformation to TFV-DP was examined in PBMCs, red blood cells (RBCs) and lymph nodes 
from monkeys (Study No. P2001025).  Animals were administered a single dose of 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg of 
[14C]TFV subcutaneously. TFV was taken up by PBMCs and anabolised to TFV-DP, with intracellular 
concentrations of the active antiviral anabolite reaching 1.6 µM (60 mg/kg dose group).  The half-life of TFV-
DP in this experiment was >50 hours. A similar pattern developed in RBCs and lymph nodes. The long 
intracellular half-life in this respect supports the proposed once daily clinical dosing regimen.   
FTC/RPV/TAF: 
While RPV is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, TAF and FTC do not interact with drug metabolizing enzymes 
as inhibitors or inducers at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, metabolic drug interactions between 
these agents are unlikely.  
FTC and TAF are analogues of two different nucleosides, cytidine and adenosine, respectively, and do not 
share a common intracellular metabolism pathway for pharmacological activation through phosphorylation. In 
experiments where both drugs were incubated together at concentrations higher than achieved in the 
plasma, the intracellular activation of TFV to its active diphosphate was not negatively influenced by the 
presence of FTC, and the activation of FTC to FTC-triphosphate, was not negatively affected by the presence 
of TFV (Study No. PC-164-2002). Also, because FTC and TAF form analogues of different nucleotides, there 
should be no competition for incorporation by HIV-1 RT and subsequent chain termination. This was 
confirmed in vitro in antiviral assays where strong synergy between FTC and TAF was observed (Study No. 
PC-183-2004). Similarly, because of the highly restricted substrate specificity of the enzymes catalysing the 
Assessment report

phosphorylation of FTC and TFV, inhibition of pharmacological activation by RPV is unlikely and there was no 
evidence for antagonism in antiviral assays in vitro. 
Excretion 
FTC: 
The primary route of elimination of [3H]FTC and [14C]FTC was via renal excretion of parent drug after oral 
and IV administration in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys, and accounted for 85%, 91% and 41% in 
mice, rats and monkeys respectively. The majority of the FTC recovered in the faeces after oral 
administration most likely represents unabsorbed drug, rather than biliary excretion. Although FTC is 
metabolised to only a minor extent, its metabolites are also excreted via the kidneys. 
Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for FTC. 
RPV: 
In mice, rat, dogs and humans, the predominant route of excretion was as unchanged drug via the faeces, 
and amounted to 87% to 96%, 93%, 95% and 85% of the administered radioactive dose in mice, rats, dogs 
and humans, respectively. Only in mice at 20 mg/kg, one metabolite, M42, was the most abundant in faeces. 
Urinary excretion of radioactivity was less than 4.2% in mice, rats, and dogs, but was slightly higher (6.1%) 
in humans. In all species, including humans, the amount of unchanged RPV in urine was negligible, and renal 
clearance of RPV is negligible. RPV was also excreted in the bile in rats (18%-25% of the administered 
radioactive dose). The amount of unchanged RPV excreted in bile was negligible (about 0.2 % within 24 
hours). The biliary excretion study demonstrated that the major part of unchanged RPV in the faeces in rats 
had not been absorbed. 
Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for RPV. 
TAF and TFV: 
Excretion of oral radiolabelled TAF has been evaluated in mice, rats and dogs.   
Mice were administered a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011). Recovery of 
radioactivity was 61% from urine and faeces 48 hours post-dose. An average of 41.3 and 27.7% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. 
Bile duct-intact and bile-duct cannulated (BDC) male SD rats were given a single 5 mg/kg oral dose of 
14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2020). [14C]TAF was rapidly excreted within 24 hours after oral dosing. The 
mean values of 71.9 and 22.2% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, 
respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. The mean overall recovery of radioactivity was 96.7%.   
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was examined following IV administration at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg to SD 
rats. Excretion was 85.2 ± 7.63% at 24 hrs, and 92.7% ± 6.77 % by 7 days post-dose in urine.  Faecal 
elimination was 3.18% ± 1.85% by 24 hours, and 4.48% ± 1.89% by 7 days post-dose. 
In dogs, the excretion of [14C]TAF was determined after administration of a single 15 mg/kg oral dose of 14C-
TAF to bile duct-intact and BDC male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007). [14C]TAF was readily excreted mostly 
within 48 hours after oral dosing. The mean values of 37.4% and 35.9% of the administered radioactivity 
were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose.  Overall mean recovery of 
radioactivity was 80.4%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 43/120 
  
  
 
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was evaluated in dogs following a single IV dose of [14C]TFV (Study No. 96-
DDM-1278-002). The primary route of elimination was via urine, where 70.03% of total radioactivity was 
recovered.  Total faecal recovery of radioactivity was 0.42% of the total dose. 
Bile excretion: Bile excretion has been examined in both rat and dog studies following oral administration 
with radiolabelled TAF. 3.2%, and 2.11% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces, urine, 
and bile, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. The mean overall recovery of radioactivity after oral dosing to 
BDC rats was 99.9%. 
The excretion of [14C]TAF was determined following oral administration of a single 15 mg/kg dose of [14C]TAF 
to male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007). Mean values of 42.7%, 26.5%, and 14.0% of the administered 
radioactivity were excreted in faeces, urine, and bile, respectively, through 168 hours post-dose. Based on 
the radioactivity excreted in urine and bile, a minimum of approximately 41% of the orally administered dose 
was absorbed. Elimination via biliary excretion appears to be the major route of elimination of [14C]TAF in 
dogs. The overall recovery of radioactivity in BDC dogs was 86.2%.   
Excretion to milk: The extent of TFV excretion in lactating monkeys was evaluated. Milk was obtained from 
two lactating adult female rhesus monkeys following a single 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of TFV (Study No. 
P2000116).  TFV was detected in the milk; the AUC in milk was between 18.6-21.5% of that seen in plasma.   
FTC/RPV/TAF: 
FTC and TFV are almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion. While TFV is a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, 
and MRP4, none of these transporters was inhibited by FTC. RPV is predominantly excreted in faeces. 
Therefore, interactions within the components of the FTC/RPV/TAF FDC during excretion are considered 
unlikely. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
FTC: 
FTC is eliminated, largely unchanged, by renal excretion, and metabolism by CYP3A enzymes plays a minor 
role in clearance of FTC. It is therefore unlikely that FTC will be a victim of drug interactions, due to inhibition 
or induction of drug metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters at the intestine or liver. Similarly, it is 
unlikely that FTC would affect the metabolism of co-administered medications through inhibition or induction.  
In vitro data confirmed that FTC was not an inhibitor of activities catalysed by CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, or 3A in human hepatic microsomal fractions. FTC also did not show inhibition of the 
glucuronidation of 7-hydroxycoumarin, a general UGT substrate. FTC did not activate human AhR or PXR at 
concentrations up to 50 μM (Study No. AD-162-2005). The ability of FTC to affect to action of drug 
transporters has been explored in a number of in vitro studies. A summary of the relevant transporters 
assessed is listed below in Table 3.6.2 (transporter substrates) and Table 3.6.3 (transport inhibition). These 
studies indicated that FTC is not a substrate or an inhibitor of any of the transporters tested, except for being 
a substrate of OAT3. 
RPV: 
In vitro, RPV was an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (IC 50 >4.2 μM [1.5 μg/mL]) and CYP2C19 (IC50 <0.06 μM [0.021 
μg/mL]). Further in vitro data indicated a possible inhibitory effect of RPV on the metabolism of substrates of 
CYP3A4, e.g. clarithromycin (IC50 = 2 μM, 0.72 μg/mL), norethindrone (IC50 = 3.9 μM, 1.4 μg/mL), and 
sildenafil (IC50 = 1.4 μM, 0.5 μg/mL); and on the metabolism of omeprazole (IC50 = 12 μM, 4.3 μg/mL), a 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 44/120 
  
  
substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 (Study No. TMC278-NC194). However, no impact was expected from 
these findings clinically since the mean Cmax was 0.13 μg/mL (Week 4 to 8) obtained in HIV-infected 
treatment-naive patients at 25 mg once daily, the recommended dose, and this was confirmed in clinical 
drug-drug interaction studies performed using substrates of CYP3A4 (atorvastatin, omeprazole, and 
norethindrone) and a substrate of CYP2C19 (omeprazole).  
RPV is also an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 in vitro with Ki values of 10 μM (3.7 μg/mL) and 1.7 μM (0.62 
μg/mL), respectively. Taking into account the clinical mean Cmax of 0.13 μg/mL, inhibition of CYP2C8 and 
CYP2C9 by RPV was not expected.  
The in vitro interaction of RPV with the metabolism of sertraline (substrate of multiple CYPs, monoamine 
oxidase and UDP-GT), paroxetine (CYP2D6), clarithromycin (CYP3A4), sildenafil (CYP3A4), omeprazole 
(CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), 17α-ethinylestradiol (Phase II metabolism), S-
mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and norethindrone (different isoenzymes) was investigated in a pooled batch of 
human liver microsomes and the same was done for abacavir (alcohol dehydrogenase) in a pooled batch of 
human liver cytosol (Study No. TMC278-NC194). RPV seemed to have a significant inhibitory effect (IC50 <5 
μM) on the metabolism of clarithromycin, sildenafil, S-mephenytoin, and norethindrone and a moderate effect 
(5 μM< IC50 <10 μM) on sertraline, paroxetine, and 17α-ethinylestradiol. Omeprazole metabolism was only 
poorly inhibited by RPV (IC 50 12 μM). RPV did not affect the metabolism of abacavir or chlorzoxazone, as 
metabolite formation of these compounds was not inhibited (IC50 >30 μM).  In summary, RPV may have a 
possible effect on the in vivo metabolism of clarithromycin, sildenafil, S-mephenytoin, and norethindrone. In 
addition, metabolism of sertraline, paroxetine, and 17α-ethinylestradiol may also be affected by RPV, 
although likely to a lesser extent.  
The potential of RPV to inhibit renal transporters, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K was assessed in vitro (Study 
Nos TMC278-FK10042 and TMC278-FK10420). RPV showed IC50 values for OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K of 
5.46, 7.51, and <0.05 μM, respectively. Since the estimated clinical unbound plasma Cmax for RPV is 3.5 nM, 
the effect of RPV on OCT2 and MATE1 is unlikely to be clinically relevant, but it cannot be excluded that RPV 
would inhibit MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Renal clearance is, however, negligible for RPV 
and it is not known what the intracellular RPV concentrations are at the local level of the MATEs’ site of 
action. Metformin is a known substrate for OCT2 and MATEs and co-administration with RPV did not affect the 
plasma exposure or urine concentrations of metformin (Clinical Study No. TMC278IFD1004). OCT2, MATE1, 
and MATE2-K are known to be involved in renal secretion of creatinine. Small increases in serum creatinine 
have been observed in humans treated with RPV, likely due to inhibition of renal transporters for creatinine, 
but these are not considered to be clinically important. 
TAF/TFV: 
The potential for TAF to be involved in drug-drug interactions has been assessed in a range of in vitro test 
systems. The potential of TAF or its metabolites to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes and serve as substrates or 
inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters was assessed. The effect of other drugs, including other antiviral agents 
that may be co-administered with TAF, on intestinal stability and the absorption potential was also 
determined.  Considering the data generated using ex vivo human tissue, the extent of unbound TAF was 
estimated to be 20% of total exposure.   
Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 enzymes and UGT1A1: 
The potential for TAF and TFV to inhibit human CYP-mediated drug metabolism was examined in vitro using 
hepatic microsomal fractions and enzyme-selective activities (Study Nos. AD-120-2003 and V990172-104).  
Inhibition of the following CYP450 enzymes was evaluated, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 45/120 
  
  
CYP2D6, and CYP3A.  TAF at a concentration of 25 µM was shown to weakly inhibit CYP3A with an IC50 
ranging from 7.4 to 7.6 µM. TFV did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A.   
In Study AD-120-2040, the potential for TAF to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of human CYP enzymes was 
investigated. TAF at a concentration of 50 µM had no effect on inhibition to any of the tested isoenzymes 
(CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6). Tenofovir alafenamide did not inhibit UGT1A1 
up to 50 µM (IC50 > 50 µM) (Study No. AD-120-2006). 
Enzymology of Metabolism: 
To examine whether TAF may be metabolised by intestinal esterases and/or CYP enzymes following intestinal 
absorption, the effects of other HIV PIs and CYP inhibitors was explored in Study AD-120-2027.  TAF was 
incubated with HIV-1 PIs (atazanivir or darunavir) or CYP inhibitors (ritonavir or COBI) at concentration of up 
to 100 µM.  The stability of TAF was unaffected by the presence of these CYP inhibitors or PIs.    
In order to investigate which enzymes are involved in activation of TAF in human hepatocytes, TAF was 
incubated alongside known CatA inhibitors (approved hepatitis C virus NS3 inhibitors, telaprevir and 
boceprevir), CES1 inhibitor (bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, BNPP), CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor (COBI), or 
telaprevir and BNPP together (Study No. AD-120-2031).  BNPP inhibited the metabolism of TAF in a dose 
dependent manner. Formation of the active constituent of TAF, TFV-DP was unaffected on co-incubation with 
telaprevir, boceprevir, or COBI. Combining BNPP and telaprevir resulted in an enhanced level of inhibition. 
From the results of this study it is implied that TAF is primarily hydrolysed by CES1 and CatA.   
Induction Liability: 
The ability of TAF to induce CYP enzymes/activity, P-gp or UGT1A1 was examined using cultured human 
helpatocytes treated with 1, 10, and 100 µM TAF once daily for 3 consecutive days (Study No. AD-120-2032). 
There was evidence of cytotoxicity following dosing with 100 µM TAF with reduced CYP activity, but increased 
mRNA levels. After treatment with 10 µM TAF, the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- and 
8.3-fold which correspond to 3% and 6% of control levels. This demonstrates that TAF has a potential to 
induce CYP isoenzymes at 10 µM, but this was reduced to little or no induction potential at 1 µM. There was 
no evidence of a change in induction potential for P-gp or UGT1A1 mRNA.   
The potential for TAF to induce human drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters through the 
activation of human AhR or human PXR was further evaluated in cell-based systems (Study No. AD-120-
2005). At a concentration of 50 µM TAF was only able to activate PXR at 23% of a positive control, rifampicin.  
This effect reduced to less than 5% with a dose of 15 µM TAF. Activation of AhR was not observed following 
dosing with 50 µM TAF. TAF is unlikely to activate either PXR or AhR xenobiotic receptors.   
Potential for Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions with TAF and TFV: 
The ability of TAF and TFV to affect to action of drug transporters has been explored in a number of in vitro 
studies. A summary of the relevant transporters affected by TAF (and EVG, COBI and FTC) is listed below in 
Table 3.6.2 (transporter substrates) and Table 3.6.3 (transport inhibition).   
TAF:  
In terms of inhibiting drug transporters, TAF was unable to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 (Study 
No.s. AD-120-2019 and AD-120-2036). Inhibition to OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1, and MATE1 was 
observed but only to a small extent, i.e. at doses that were 200-fold in excess to clinical meaningful 
exposures.  TAF is unlikely to mediate the role of transporter-mediated drug interactions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 46/120 
  
  
In terms of TAF acting as a substrate to drug transporters, TAF has been shown to be a substrate for 
intestinal efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP.  There is an increase in TAF absorption in the presence of 
cyclosporine A (CsA) and COBI (inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP) (Study Nos. AD-120-2037 and AD-120-2013). 
In a study in which dogs were orally administered TAF at 2 mg/kg following untreated or pretreated animals 
with 75 mg/kg CsA, there was increased exposure to TAF in the CsA pretreated animals, although this had no 
effect on the overall level of TFV present. The increased TAF plasma exposure led to an increase in levels of 
TFV-DP detected in PBMCs, suggesting that co-administration of TAF with an efflux transport inhibitor (i.e. 
COBI) would increase absorption and also result in higher levels of the active anti-viral substance, TFV-DP.   
TAF was found to be a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Exposure to TAF 
may be affected by inhibitors of these transporters or genetic polymorphisms that affect the transport 
activities.  Unlike TFV, TAF was not a substrate for renal transporters, OAT1 and OAT3. 
TFV:  
The route of elimination of TFV is renal excretion by a combination of glomerular filtration and tubular 
secretion.  In order to understand the role of transporters in the renal secretion of TFV and to explore 
potential drug interactions based on these transport systems, the interactions of TFV with a variety of both 
uptake and efflux transporters were studied in vitro.   
Results of in vitro transport studies indicate that the active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by human 
OAT1 (basolateral uptake) and MRP4 (apical efflux) transporters acting in series in proximal tubules (Study 
Nos. PC-103-2001, AD-104-2001, AD-104-2002).  Human OAT3 may play a secondary role in the tubular 
uptake of TFV.  Neither P-gp nor MRP2 appear to be involved in the efflux of TFV.   
As the primary transporter handling the uptake of TFV, OAT1 has been assessed for its potential role in drug 
interactions between TFV and other renally secreted therapeutics including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory 
agents, and other antivirals. Under physiologically relevant conditions, none of the tested drugs affected 
OAT1-mediated transport of TFV, indicating a low potential for renal interactions with TFV due to inhibition of 
this pathway (Study No. PC-104-2010 and Study No. PC-104-2011).  
COBI also shows no detectable inhibition of human OAT1 or OAT3.  Similarly, PIs ATV, LPV, and RTV did not 
exhibit any effect on the active cellular elimination of TFV mediated by the MRP4 efflux pump, and COBI is a 
very weak inhibitor of MRP4.  The results of in vitro drug interaction studies indicate that PIs or COBI are 
unlikely to exert any substantial effect on the renal elimination of TFV in general or result in the accumulation 
of TFV in renal proximal tubules.  
The results from in vitro studies investigating the contribution from MRP1 in tubular reabsorption of TFV 
(Study No. PC-104-2014) indicated that MRP1 is not involved in the reabsorption of TFV at the basolateral 
membrane of proximal tubule cells.  
TFV did not inhibit the activity of human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 >300 μM), so TFV is unlikely to cause drug 
interactions through inhibition of these transporters (Study No. AD-104-2012). 
FTC, TAF, and TFV do not inhibit any of the transporters tested at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. 
Therefore, FTC, TAF, and TFV are unlikely to be perpetrators of transporter-mediated drug interactions. Renal 
excretion of TFV is facilitated by basolateral uptake by OAT1 and OAT3 and apical efflux by the MRP4 efflux 
transporter. There is no evidence for inhibition of TFV renal excretion by FTC as it shows undetectable 
inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, and MRP4 in vitro.

FTC/RPV/TAF: 
While RPV is primarily metabolised by CYP 3A, FTC, TAF and TFV are not clinically relevant substrates, 
inhibitors, or inducers. In addition, TFV and FTC do not inhibit each other's pharmacological activation 
through phosphorylation. Thus, the drug interactions through drug metabolizing enzymes within the three 
compounds are unlikely. However, co-administration of strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A may affect 
exposure to RPV. In addition to the studies described for FTC and TAF, a number of transporter studies were 
conducted with the STB components, EVG, COBI, FTC, and TFV. Since TFV is the major circulating metabolite 
for both TDF and TAF, these results are relevant to evaluate the potential for transporter-mediated drug-drug 
interactions among these components. 
Based on the available data FTC, TAF, and TFV are unlikely to be a perpetrator of transporter-mediated drug 
interactions. 
Renal excretion of TFV is facilitated by basolateral uptake by OAT1 and OAT3 and apical efflux by the MRP4 
efflux transporter. There is no evidence for inhibition of TFV renal excretion by FTC as it shows undetectable 
inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, and MRP4 in vitro. 
While RPV was found to inhibit P-gp with IC50 of 9.2 μM in vitro, it is not a clinically relevant inhibitor as 
exposure of digoxin and TAF was not affected by RPV (Clinical Study No. TMC278IFD1001, GS-US-120-0117, 
and GS-US-120-1554). As discussed above, inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1 by RPV observed in vitro is 
unlikely to be clinically relevant. In addition, inhibition of MATE2-K by RPV may not result in drug-drug 
interactions with xenobiotics which are substrates for both MATE1 and MATE2-K. Drug interactions through 
inhibition of these transporters by RPV within the components of the FTC/RPV/TAF FDC are unlikely as FTC 
and TAF components of the FTC/RPV/TAF FDC were clinically bioequivalent to the E/C/F/TAF FDC (Clinical 
Study No. GS-US-336-1159). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
FTC toxicology summary 
Emtricitabine  (FTC)  is  an  NRTI  that  is  marketed  as  a  once-daily  capsule  (Emtriva  200  mg)  and  as  an  oral 
solution (Emtrival Oral Solution 10 mg/mL) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. FTC is a synthetic analogue 
of  the  naturally  occurring  pyrimidine  nucleoside,  2′-deoxycytidine  that  is  structurally  similar  to  lamivudine 
(Epivir).  Intracellularly,  FTC  is  phosphorylated  by  cellular  enzymes  to  form  the  active  metabolite, 
emtricitabine triphosphate. 
The  general  systemic  (single  and  repeat  dose)  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  toxicity, 
and immunotoxicity of FTC have been characterized in a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
The non-clinical toxicity studies demonstrated that FTC was well tolerated after oral dosing for up to one year 
at  doses  producing  systemic  exposure  levels  in  animals  much  greater  than  those  anticipated  in  patients 
treated with the recommended clinical dose. 
Treatment-related  effects  were  confined  to  high-dose  groups  only  and  included  changes  in  red  blood  cell 
(RBC)  parameters,  interpreted  as  a  mild,  reversible  anaemia  (mice  1  month,  6  months;  rat  3  months; 
monkey 1 year); changes in various organ  weights without any associated adverse histopathological effects 
in  rodents  (mouse  1  month,  6  months;  rat  3  months),  increased  urine  output  (mice  6  months),  and  soft 
faeces  (monkeys  1  month,  3  months).  No  observed  effect  levels  (NOELs)  could  be  established  for  all

treatment-related  effects,  and  in  several  cases  the  minor  effects  observed  were  reversible  after  a  recovery 
period. 
FTC was not genotoxic or clastogenic. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats showed no evidence 
of  carcinogenic  potential  at  exposures  greater  than  25  times  those  observed  in  humans  at  the  therapeutic 
dose. FTC did not adversely affect reproduction or embryo-fetal development. It was relatively non-cytotoxic 
to human cells in vitro, including bone marrow progenitor cells, and did not produce mitochondrial toxicity. 
The  impurities  and  degradation  products  in  the  FTC  drug  substance  have  been  identified  and  qualified  in 
toxicology studies. 
RPV toxicology summary 
Rilpivirine (RPV, TMC278) is an NNRTI active against wild type and NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 that is marketed as 
a  once-daily  tablet  (Edurant  25  mg)  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  and  is  a  component  of 
Complera®/Eviplera® (FTC/RPV/TDF). The following convention is applied throughout this module: reference 
is  made  to  “TMC278”  when  the  hydrochloride  (HCl)  salt  was  administered  and  to  “TMC278  base”  when  the 
base  was  administered.  The  dose  or  concentration  is  always  given  as  base  equivalent.  The  analyte  in 
bioanalytical determinations is referred to as “TMC278.” 
All  in  vivo  studies  were  done  by  oral  administration,  with  the  exception  of  the  sensitisation  and  dermal 
irritation  studies.  For  oral  dosing,  TMC278  base  was  dissolved  in  polyethylene  glycol  400  (PEG400)  usually 
with  100  mg/mL  citric  acid  (CA)  to  improve  exposure,  with  the  exception  of  the  rabbit  studies  in  which 
TMC278  base  was  suspended  in  0.5%  (m/v;  mass  per  volume)  aqueous  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose 
(HPMC). TMC278 was suspended in 0.5% (m/v) aqueous HPMC in the mouse, rat, and dog studies. In studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys, the vehicle was 1% (m/v) aqueous HPMC with 0.5% v/v Tween 20. 
No formal single-dose studies were conducted and single dose evaluations were part of the initial dose range 
finding studies or, in the case of mice, part of the bone marrow micronucleus test. The single-dose toxicity of 
TMC278  in  mice,  rats,  and  dogs  appeared  to  be  low.  The  maximal  feasible  dose  did  not  induce  significant 
toxicity or effects. 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  done  in  mice  as  preparation  for  a  3-month  dose  range  finding 
carcinogenicity study; in rats for up to 6 months; in non-pregnant rabbits for 5 days as preparation for the 
dose range finding early embryonic development studies; in dogs up to 12 months; and in immature female 
cynomolgus monkeys up to 8 weeks as part of the assessment of the effects of TMC278 on juvenile animals. 
Juvenile  rats  were  used  in  a  2-week  oral  dosing  study  starting  on  lactation  Day  12  (LD  12).  The  dogs  in 
studies up to 1-month duration are also considered immature. Since the animals were 6.5 to 8 months old at 
the  start  of  these  studies  they  were  not  yet  sexually  mature  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  period.  Reversibility 
(after a 1-month recovery period) of the effects of TMC278 on the high dose group was investigated in the 6-
month rat study and the 1-month dog study. 
The targets of toxicity of TMC278 identified in the repeat-dose studies were: red  blood cells (RBCs; mouse, 
rat, and dog); coagulation (rat); liver (rat and dog); kidneys (mouse and dog); thyroid gland with secondary 
effects on the pituitary gland (rat); adrenal glands (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey); testes (dog); 
and  ovaries  (dog,  in  immature  females  with  secondary  effects  on  other  tissues  of  the  genital  tract  and  on 
mammary glands). The majority of the induced effects appeared to be completely reversible after a 1-month 
dose-free  period.  The  effects  on  thyroid  gland  and  coagulation  in  rats  and  on  liver  and  serum  alkaline 
phosphatase  (ALP)  in  dogs  showed  signs  of  recovery,  but  this  was  not  complete  at  the end  of  the 1-month

recovery period. A number of targets were affected at the low dose tested in dogs and cynomolgus monkeys 
preventing establishment of no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in these two species. 
TMC278  did  not  show  a  potential  for  genotoxicity  in  the  in  vitro  bacterial  reverse  mutation  (Ames)  tests, 
mouse  lymphoma  assays  or  in  the  in  vivo  mouse  bone  marrow  micronucleus  test.  No  potential  for 
carcinogenicity  was  concluded  in  the  2-year  studies  in  mice  and  rats.  The  hepatocellular  adenomas  and 
carcinomas seen in mice are considered to be induced by liver enzyme induction, an epigenetic mechanism. 
Similarly, the hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in rats were also 
considered to derive as result of liver enzyme induction and a likely associated increased clearance of thyroid 
hormones leading to a continuous stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). No 
neoplastic lesions associated with the other targets of TMC278 were detected. 
TMC278  did  not  show  a  teratogenic  potential  and  did  not  affect  fertility,  fecundity,  early  embryonic 
development,  maternal  behaviour  at  parturition  and  during  lactation,  or  peri- and  postnatal  development  of 
offspring from dams (rats) treated with TMC278. 
Overall,  TMC278  had  a  similar  toxicological  profile  in  juvenile  or  sexually  immature  rats,  dogs,  and 
cynomolgus  monkeys  as  in  adult  animals.  The  TMC278-related  effects  on  the  female  genital  tract  and 
mammary  glands  in  dogs  at  the  end  of  the  1-month  studies  differed  from  the  effects  in  longer  duration 
studies  in  which  animals  were  sexually  mature  animals  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  period.  The  activation  of 
ovaries in dogs treated with TMC278 in the 1-month studies led to secondary activation noticed in the other 
parts  of  the  genital  tract  and  mammary  glands.  These  secondary  effects  occur  normally  in  sexually  mature 
animals during oestrous cycle. Therefore, they were not noted as a difference between TMC278-treated and 
control  animals  in  longer  duration  studies.  However,  in  the  1-month  study,  the  control  animals  were  still 
dormant  (i.e.,  no  activation  of  ovaries  and  therefore  no  secondary  effects).  In  the  evaluation  relative  to 
control  animals,  the  secondary  effects  were  noted.  Activation  of  ovaries  was  not  induced  during  an  8-week 
study in immature cynomolgus monkeys at the age of approximately 18 months at the start of the study. 
TMC278  tested  negative  for  the  potential  to  cause  phototoxicity,  skin  irritation,  and  delayed-type 
hypersensitivity and to induce an immunotoxic effect on the challenge of rats with sheep RBCs. TMC278 was 
classified as a moderate eye irritant in an in vitro test.  
The  RPV  drug  substance  contains  three  impurities  that  were  qualified  according  to  ICH  Q3A  (R2).  Two  of 
these,  R600682  and  R600683,  have  been  evaluated  by  spiking  to  the  drug  substance  at  a  level  of  4%. 
Qualification  comprised  a  bacterial  reverse  mutation  Ames  test,  a  mouse  lymphoma  assay,  and  a  1-month 
oral rat study. The presence of the impurities at 4% did not modify the effects of TMC278 in any of the tests. 
The  third  impurity,  R289932,  is  the  Z-isomer  of  TMC278.  This  isomer  was  present  in  all  drug  substance 
batches involved in pivotal non-clinical studies at the level of minimally 0.61%. In view of the close structural 
relationship  with  TMC278  and  the  overage  between  the  lowest  non-clinical  dose  (5  mg/kg/day)  and  the 
recommended clinical dose of 25 mg once daily, separate qualification of R289932 is not considered relevant. 
Three  further  (potential)  impurities,  T002592,  R600646,  and  R600687,  containing  structural  mutagenic 
alerts,  are  present  in  the  drug  substance  at  levels  that  do  not  warrant  qualification  according  to  ICH  Q3A 
(R2).  The  mutagenic  potentials  of  the  HCl  salts  of  T002592,  T002594,  and  of  R600646  and  R600687  were 
tested  in  an  Ames  test.  Only  T002594  showed  a  mutagenic  potential.  T002592  is  considered  a  genotoxic 
impurity.  The  maximum  allowable  level  of  T002592  in  a  daily  dose  of  25  mg  TMC278  was  calculated  to  be 
400 ppm, on the basis of the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach with daily treatment for 1-
10 years per ICH M7. The level of T002592 in drug substance and drug product has been controlled at less 
than 10 ppm.

TAF toxicology summary 
Tenofovir  alafenamide  (TAF)  is  a  prodrug  of  Tenofovir  (TFV).  Comprehensive  programmes  of  non-clinical 
studies  have  previously  been  conducted  with  RPV  and  FTC  in  support  of  marketing  authorisations  for  these 
medicinal products. As a result, only new data relating to TAF will be discussed in this report, and only brief 
toxicology summaries have been included below for FTC and RPV.  
Tenofovir  alafenamide  was  evaluated  in  mouse,  rat,  dog,  and  non-human  primate  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies up to 39 weeks in duration. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted. Rat fertility and 
developmental  toxicity  studies  were  conducted,  along  with  developmental  and  reproductive  toxicity  studies 
and  a  local irritation  study  in  the  rabbit.  The  vehicle  for  toxicity  studies  used was  1)  25mM  citric  acid or  2) 
0.5%  polysorbate  20,  0.5%  carboxymethylcellulose,  0.9%  benzyl  alcohol  or  3)  0.1%  (v/v)  Tween  20  and 
0.1% (v/v) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). 
With 
agreement 
from 
the  Committee 
for  Medicinal 
Products 
for  Human  Use 
(CHMP) 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012;  EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1),  no  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted 
due to the lack of TAF exposure in rats and TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats and mice compared 
to  the  same  studies  in  which  TDF  was  administered.  No  peri/postnatal  study  was  conducted  based  on 
scientific  advice  adopted  by  CHMP  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/  214541/2013;  EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1).  As 
with the carcinogenicity study rationale, there is an inability to measure plasma concentrations of TAF in rats, 
and TFV exposure after TAF administration was less than that already tested in the TDF peri/postnatal study. 
In the development of TAF, 3 forms of the active drug substance were used: GS-7340, synonym for GS-7340 
as the free base; GS-7340-02, synonym for GS-7340 as the monofumarate (1:1 molar ratio of free base to 
fumaric acid), and GS-7340-03, synonym for the hemifumarate (2:1 molar ratio of free base to fumaric acid). 
The  hemifumarate,  GS-7340-03  (TAF  fumarate)  is  the  selected  for  final  development.  It  is  stated  that  GS-
7340-03  is  considered  comparable  to  GS-7340-02  based  on  physical/chemical  properties  and  both  exist  as 
the free base in blood and biological fluids.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies used GS-7340-02. However, the applicant states that any potential effects of the 
hemifumarate  have  been  evaluated  by  studies  of  the  monofumarate.  The  hemifumarate,  GS-7340-03  was 
used in the male and female fertility study, dermal and ocular irritation studies, the local lymph node assay, 
and a second impurity qualification study.

The FTC/RPV/TAF FDC contains the same dose of FTC (200 mg) that is currently approved within Emtriva®, 
FTC/TDF 
(Truvada®), 
FTC/efavirenz/TDF 
(Atripla®), 
FTC/RPV/TDF 
(Complera®/Eviplera®)  and 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/FTC/TDF  (Stribild®)  and  the  same  dose  of  RPV  (25  mg)  currently  approved  within 
Edurant®  and  Complera®/Eviplera®.  Comprehensive  programs  of  non-clinical  toxicology  studies  with  FTC, 
RPV,  and  TAF  have  been  completed.  Based  on  the  well-characterized  toxicity  profiles  of  FTC,  RPV  and  TAF, 
the low potential for toxicologic interaction noted in the combination toxicology studies with FTC/TDF and the 
clinical  safety  data  for  TVD  (Truvada),  and  other  FTC/TDF-containing  regimens  including  FTC/RPV/TDF,  the 
available  data  demonstrate  an  acceptable  benefit/risk  profile  for  the  proposed  use  of  the  FTC/RPV/TAF  FDC 
product.  In  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of 
Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005,  January  2008),  non-clinical  safety  studies  with  the 
FTC/RPV /TAF combination were therefore not conducted.  
Single dose toxicity 
In male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (5/sex/group) given an oral dose (15 mL/kg) of TAF at 100, 300, or 
1000 mg/kg (80, 240, 800 mg/kg free base equivalents [f.b.e.]/kg) followed by a 14-day observation period 
(study number: R990185) the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg. 
Male and female beagle dogs (1/sex/group) were given a single oral dose (15 mL/kg) of 30, 90, or 270 
mg/kg (24, 72, 216 mg f.b.e./kg) TAF followed by a 14-day observation period (Study number: D990181). 
In-life observations of salivation, vomiting, reduced activity, tremors, incoordination seen at 270 mg/kg 
which resolved 2 days following dosing. There was an increase in blood urea nitrogen at 270 mg/kg (present 
on study Day 2, not study Day 14. Thymus weights were reduced at all doses compared with controls, and 
thymic atrophy was present in males at 90 and 270 mg/kg. Renal tubular changes characterised by 
basophilia and/or karyomegaly were present in the male at 270 mg/kg and females at 270 mg/kg and 90 
mg/kg. The NOAEL as considered to be 30 mg/kg.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Mouse 
A two week mouse study was conducted. However, the results were not interpretable due to a large number 
of confirmed gavage errors and the viscosity of the formulation. These data will not be discussed further. 
13-Week GLP Oral Mouse Toxicity Study (study number TX-120-2007) 
Crl:CD1(ICR)  mice  (15/sex/group)  were  given  10,  30  or  100  mg/kg/day  (8,  24,  80  mg  f.b.e./kg/day).  The 
vehicle used was 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (v/v) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). Reduced body 
weight gain was seen at 100 mg/kg/day in males and at all doses in females. Reduced food consumption was 
noted at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. In the nasal turbinates, an increased incidence and severity of minimal to 
slight infiltrates of neutrophils in respiratory and olfactory mucosa, and minimal to moderate (100 mg/kg/day 
only) degeneration of olfactory epithelium was seen in both sexes at all doses. In addition, adverse findings 
were  noted  in  the  nasal  turbinates  (exudate  in  the  lumen)  of  both  sexes  at  30  mg/kg/day  and  100 
mg/kg/day.  Minimal  infiltrates  and  minimal  olfactory  degeneration  were  observed  at  a  lower  incidence  in 
control  animals.  Minimal  increased  apoptosis  of  the  rectum  was  seen  in  males  and  females  at  100 
mg/kg/day. No NOAEL could be determined. Due to limited concentration data for TAF, AUC values could not 
be calculated. At week 13, the TFV AUCtau (combined sexes) was 0.213 μg·h/mL at 10 mg/kg/day. 
Rat 
4-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (Study number R990182) 
Daily oral administration of GS-7340-02 (15 mL/kg) at 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (1.2, 5, 20, 
80,  320  mg  free  base  equivalents  (f.b.e.)/kg/day)  to  SD  rats  (10/sex/group)  for  28  days  resulted  in 
decreased  body  weight  gain,  reduced  food  consumption,  decreases  in  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  and  RBC 
parameters,  calciuria,  decreased  bone  mineral  density  (BMD),  decreased  1,25  dihydroxy  vitamin  D3,  renal 
karyomegaly,  thymic  atrophy,  and  atrophy  of  cancellous  bone  of  the  femur.  Most  effects  were  seen  at  400 
mg/kg/day  group;  however,  some  changes  were  noted  at  25  mg/kg/day  with  a  non-significant  decrease  in 
1,25  dihydroxy  vitamin  D3  observed  at  6.25  mg/kg/day.  Based  on  changes  in  WBCs,  the  NOAEL  was 
considered to be 6.25 mg/kg/day (no change in WBC count was observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in 
the subsequent 26-week rat toxicity study – see below). 
26-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (Study number TOX-120-001).  
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 5, 25, and 100 mg/kg/day (4, 20, 80 mg f.b.e./kg/day) to 
SD rats (15/sex/group) for 26 weeks resulted in minimal renal cortical tubular karyomegaly (100 mg/kg/day) 
and  minimal  to  slight  tibial  cancellous  bone  atrophy  (females,  100  mg/kg/day),  changes  in  bone  density 
measurements  (100  mg/kg/day)  and  changes  in  biochemical  markers  of  bone  turnover  (25  and  100 
mg/kg/day)  were  also  noted.  These  effects  were  not  observed  at  5  mg/kg/day.  TAF  (GS-7340-02)  dose-
dependently  increase  biochemical  markers  of  bone  turnover  in  males  and  dose-independently  decrease 
serum 1,25-dihydroxy- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in both sexes at 25 and 100 mg/kg/day. It is stated that 
as the effects (increases in biochemical markers of bone turnover and changes in related hormones) seen at 
25 mg/kg/day were minimal, the NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic  analysis  of  plasma  samples  showed  that  TAF  was  rapidly  absorbed  after  oral  dosing  and  was 
rapidly  converted  to  TFV.  No  consistent  differences  in  plasma  pharmacokinetics  were  found  between  the 
sexes. Tenofovir was eliminated from the plasma with half-lives ranging from 7 to 13 hours. Mean TFV Cmax 
and AUC values for combined sex groups increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 mg/kg/day 
to 100 mg/kg/day at each study period.

Rabbits (Study number TX-120-2003) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 20, 50 and 75 mg/kg/day to female rabbits, for 7 days, was 
generally well tolerated. Plasma exposure to TAF and TFV generally increased with increase in dose level from 
20 to 75 mg/kg/day. Values for mean Cmax and AUC0-t of TFV were generally higher on Day 7 than on Day 1. 
TAF  was  rapidly  and extensively  converted  to  TFV.  The  mean  TAF  AUC0-t on  day  7  was  not  calculated  at  20 
mg/kg/day  (due  to  values  below  the  lower  limit  of  quantitation  of  1.00  ng/mL)  and  was  0.252  and  1.174 
μg·hr/mL at 50 and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively. The mean TFV AUC0-t on day 7 was 2.256, 5.741 and 10.070 
μg·hr/mL at 20, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Dog 
4-Week Oral Toxicity Study (Study number: D990175) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.08, 0.24, 0.8, 2.4, 8 mg 
f.b.e./kg/day) (Study number D990175) to male and female beagle dogs (4/sex/group) for 28 days resulted 
in increased AST in females at 10 mg/kg/day and renal tubular karyomegaly and/or basophilia in both sexes 
at  10  mg/kg/day  and  1  male  and  1  female  at  3  mg/kg/day.  Mean  values  for  bone  specific  alkaline 
phosphatase, N telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and 25 hydroxy-vitamin D were 
generally similar across all groups. There were no effects on peripheral quantitative computed tomography-
derived bone densitometry parameters (eg, bone mineral content and bone mineral density of the total slice 
and trabecular and cortical/subcortical compartments). The NOAEL was considered to be 1 mg/kg/day. 
At the lower doses, only Cmax and Tmax values for TAF were determined as most values were below the lower 
limit of quantitation of the assay. TAF was rapidly absorbed on Day 1, with median peak values within 0.25 to 
0.5  hours  of  18.5,  38.7,  and  0.582  μg/mL  at  1.0,  3.0,  and  10  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  Peak  TFV 
concentrations occurred within 1 hour. At 10 mg/kg/day, Day 28 TFV Cmax and AUCtau were 0.44 μg/mL and 
5.26  μg·h/mL,  respectively  (males  and  females  combined).  Comparisons  between  Day  1  and  Day  28  at  10 
mg/kg/day  showed  potential  accumulation  upon  repeat  dosing.  Tenofovir  in  PBMCs  was  measurable  (18.6 
μg/mL) after 28 days of 10 mg/kg/day TAF. 
39-Week Oral Toxicity Study with a 3 month recovery period (Study number: TOX-120-002). 
Male and female beagle dogs were administered daily oral doses (10 mL/kg) of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 2, 6, or 
18/12  mg/kg/day  (1.6,  4.8,  14.4/9.6  mg  f.b.e./kg/day)  for  13  weeks  (2/sex/group)  or  39  weeks 
(4/sex/group).  A  dose-related  decrease in  body  weight  gain  at 39  weeks  was  seen  in  all  males  at  all  doses 
and  for  females  at  18/12  mg/kg/day.  The  dose  for  the  high  dose  group  was  reduced  from  18  to  12 
mg/kg/day on Days 45 and 51, for males and females, respectively, due to the occurrence of severe clinical 
signs and reduced body weight.  
There  were  two  unscheduled  deaths  (2  males  at  18  mg/kg).  One  of  these  was  considered  to  be  due  to  a 
gavage  accident.  A  different  male  at  18  mg/kg  was  killed  on  Day  45  due  to  deteriorating  clinical  condition, 
which  was  considered  to  be  treatment  related.  Prior  to  necropsy,  this  animal  had  shown  reduced  body 
weight, reduced food consumption, increased AST, globulin levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, total bilirubin, and 
decreased  monocyte  and  platelet  counts.  Macroscopically,  there  was  bilateral  enlargement  of  the 
submandibular lymph nodes, which  histologically had slight inflammation and plasmacytosis. Histopathology 
consisted  of  mild,  mononuclear  infiltrate  in  the  ocular  posterior  uvea;  renal  cortical  tubular  degeneration; 
atrophy of GALT, mesenteric lymph node, and thymus accompanied by an infiltrate of macrophages; mucosal

atrophy  of  the  fundic  gland;  mucosal  hyperplasia  of  the  pyloric  gland;  and  mucosal  degeneration  and/or 
regeneration in the cecum and colon. 
Increased  mean  AST  (~2.6x  compared  to  control)  and  total  bilirubin  (~1.6x  compared  to  control)  in  dogs 
administered  18/12  mg/kg/day.  No  ECG  changes  occurred  at  2  mg/kg/day.  At  Week  39,  a  dose-related 
prolongation  of  PR  interval  was  observed  at  6  (~  +13%)  and  18/12-mg/kg/day  (~  +24%)  groups.  TAF 
reduce heart rate with an associated QT interval prolongation was seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day. According to the 
Applicant, these changes were associated with decreases in serum triiodothyronine (T3).  After the 13-week 
recovery period, serum T3 values returned to levels similar to the controls.  
The applicant states that all bone markers showed age-related decreases. After 3 months, there were some 
differences  noted  among  mean  values  for  bone  formation  (skeletal  alkaline  phosphatase  [sALP])  and  bone 
resorption markers (urinary free deoxypyridinoline and N telopeptide) at all doses compared to controls. After 
9  months,  statistically  significant  increases  in  mean  values  for  the  bone  resorption  marker  urinary  N 
telopeptide were noted for both sexes at 18/12 mg/kg/day (p ≤0.05), compared to controls. A similar though 
not statistically significant trend was noted in animals at 6 mg/kg/day, suggesting a dose-related response. 
No significant changes in free deoxypyridinoline were observed, with no consistent effects (increases) among 
treated  groups.  For the  formation marker,  serum  sALP  values  at  all doses  were  comparable  controls  except 
for one  male  at  18/12  mg/kg/day,  which  was  outside  the  control  ranges  (no  further  details  are  provided  in 
the  non-clinical  toxicology  summary).  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  bone  marker  values  returned  to 
below the control range consistent with an age effect and recovery from treatment. 
At  18/12  mg/kg/day  administered  once  daily  to  young  beagle  dogs  for  39  weeks  changes  in  bone 
densitometry  parameters  (by  dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry  [DXA]  analysis)  considered  to  reflect 
primarily  effects  on  bone  growth  were  observed.  These  changes  were  considered  by  the  Applicant  as 
secondary to the effects on body weight. 
Histopathology changes were noted in the kidneys, eyes, lungs, and spleen after both 13 and 39 weeks. The 
liver and possibly the adrenal glands were additional target organs identified after 39 weeks. After 13-weeks 
of treatment, findings of renal cortical tubular degeneration/regeneration and karyomegaly were seen at 6 or 
18/12 mg/kg/day; findings after 39 weeks of treatment were similar. These changes were minimal to slight 
(Grade  1  to  2)  at  6  mg/kg/day  in  both  sexes.  At  18/12  mg/kg/day  severity  ranged  from  mild  to  moderate 
(Grade  2  to  3).  After  39-weeks  of  treatment,  similar  lesions  (minimal  (Grade  1)  karyomegaly  and  tubular 
degeneration) were seen in 2 males at 2 mg/kg/day.  
A minimal to slight (Grade 1 to 2) infiltration of mononuclear cells in the ocular posterior uvea was noted in 
some  animals  at  18/12  mg/kg/day  after  both  treatment  periods.  Alveolar  histiocytosis  was  present  in  the 
lungs  after  13-weeks  at  18/12  mg/kg/day.  Additional  pulmonary  findings  noted  following  39-weeks  of 
treatment  and  consisted  of  macrophage  accumulation  with  pigment,  which  was  detected  predominantly  at 
18/12 mg/kg/day and in few animals at 6 or 2 mg/kg/day. An infiltration of macrophages laden with pigment 
was very frequently seen in the splenic white pulp at 18/12 mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. After 39 
weeks  of  treatment,  centrilobular  hepatocellular  cytoplasmic  acidophilic  inclusions  were  seen  at  18/12 
mg/kg/day,  pigment  deposits  in  hepatic  macrophages  and/or  sinusoidal  cells  (Kupffer  cells)  was  seen  at 
18/12 mg/kg/day. Also, similar pigment deposits in the sinusoidal cells (tissue macrophages) of the adrenal 
glands  were  seen  in  a  few  animals  at  18/12  mg/kg/day.  The  Applicant  states  that  the  cause  of  the 
intracellular  pigment  in  tissue  macrophages  in  the  lung,  liver,  spleen,  and  adrenal  is  not  known,  but  could 
represent accumulation of the test article and/or test article metabolite(s) in these cells of the mononuclear 
phagocyte  system.  After  the  13-week  recovery  period,  test  article-related  histological  changes  were  still 
present in the kidneys, lungs, and liver, but were however reduced in incidence and severity.

At  18/12  mg/kg/day,  a  minimal  infiltration  of  histiocytes  was  present  in  some  organs  (eye  [choroid  plexus, 
ciliary body], lung, and spleen) in some animals. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were normal. 
The NOAEL after 39 weeks of treatment was considered to be 2 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related findings were 
completely or partially reversible following a 13-week recovery period. 
Toxicokinetic  analysis  showed  that  TAF  was  rapidly  absorbed  and  converted  to  TFV  following  oral  dose 
administration,  with  peak  plasma  concentrations  of  TAF  and  TFV  occurring  0.5  and  1  hour  after  dosing, 
respectively.  The  systemic  exposure  of  TAF  was  dose  dependent.  Plasma  Cmax  and  AUC  values  for  GS-7340 
increased  more  than  proportionally  over  the  dose  range.  Plasma  Cmax  and  AUC,  increased  roughly  in 
proportion  to  the  administered  dose.  There  was  some  accumulation  of  TFV  following  repeat  dosing 
(approximately 3-fold). There were no gender differences in exposure. 
Tenofovir  concentrations  in  PBMCs  were  measurable  at  24  hours  after  dosing  at  all  doses.  The  median 
terminal  phase  half-life  of  total  TFV  in  PBMCs  was  estimated  to  be  31  hours  (similar  to  the  TFV  plasma 
estimate)  from  the  recovery  animals  with  PBMC  concentrations  measured  up  to  72  hours.  Dose-normalised 
PBMC mean AUC values of total TFV increased more than dose proportionally during Week 39/40. 
Non-human primate  
4-Week Oral Rhesus Monkey Toxicity Study (Study number P2000114) 
Animals  were  given  TAF  (GS-7340-02)  at  3  or  30  mg/kg/day  (2.4,  24  mg  f.b.e./kg/day)  or  TFV  at  15 
mg/kg/day. According to the company, there were no adverse in-life effects and no clear test article-related 
effects  on  body  weight,  serum  chemistry,  plasma  chemistry,  haematology  (including  lymphocyte  subsets 
determined  by  flow  cytometry),  standard  urinalysis  parameters,  organ  weights,  and  bone-related  or 
histologic parameters. There was 1 death at 30 mg/kg/day TAF, which was not considered test article-related 
(no  further  details  are  provided  on  the  toxicology  summary).  Kidney,  liver  and  skeletal  muscle  samples 
assayed for indicators of mitochondrial integrity showed no effects. The NOAEL for TAF was considered to be 
30 mg/kg/day.  
The TAF  Cmax values were nonlinear with dose, with greater than expected increases in Cmax with dose. The 
TAF  AUCtau  could  only  be  calculated  at  30  mg/kg/day  group,  with  a  mean  value  of  1.03  µg·h/mL  and  a 
terminal elimination half-life of 0.335 hours. There were no gender differences in exposure. 
Day  28  TFV  Cmax  and  AUC  exhibited  slightly  greater  than  proportional  increases  with  increasing  dose. 
Comparison between Days 1 and 28 showed no statistical difference for Cmax or AUC indicating no change in 
clearance over time. There were no gender differences in exposure.

TAF was shown to be negative in 2 in vitro and one in vivo genotoxicity study. 
FTC/RPV/TAF combination: 
FTC, RPV and TAF are considered non-genotoxic agents. The combination of the three components is 
therefore not expected to have an altered genotoxicity profile as compared with that of the individual agents. 
Carcinogenicity 
Based 
on 
the 
scientific 
advice 
adopted 
by 
the  CHMP 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1),  carcinogenicity  studies  are  not  required  for  TAF registration  based on  the lack 
of TAF exposure in rats and TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats and mice compared to TDF. 
Daily administration of TDF at dose levels of up to 300 mg/kg/day administered for 104 weeks did not reveal 
any  evidence  of  carcinogenicity  in  mice.  At  600  mg/kg/day,  a  low  incidence  of  duodenal  tumours  was 
observed,  possibly  related  to  high  local  test  article  concentration  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  This  is 
adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. In rats, daily administration of TDF at dose levels up to 300 
mg/kg/day did not reveal any evidence of carcinogenicity. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Oral Fertility and General Reproduction Toxicity Study of TAF in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study 
number TX-120-2012).  
Male and female Crl:CD(SD) rats 20, 80, or 160 mg free base equivalent (f.b.e.)/kg/day (22, 90, 180 mg GS-
7340-03/kg/day) TFV (GS-7340-03). Males were necropsied after at least 10 weeks of dosing, the 
reproductive organs were weighed followed by assessment of sperm motility and total concentration. Male 
and female reproductive performance was evaluated based on results of confirmation of mating and 
pregnancy. There were some effects on male body weight at 80 and 160 mg/kg/day and female at 160 
mg/kg/day throughout the study.  
There were no differences in premating oestrous cycles. There were no test article-related differences in male 
or female reproductive parameters. There were no test article-related effects on the uterine and fetal

parameters and no significant differences in female reproductive organ weights. There was a slight increase 
in absolute testis weight (significant increase (9%) in the adjusted mean of the left testis only) at 160 
mg/kg/day. This was considered by the Applicant to be test article-related, but not adverse, as there were no 
other reproductive organ weight or functional reproductive effects. There were no test article-related effects 
observed on mean epididymal sperm motility or on sperm concentration. The NOAEL for male and female 
toxicity was 80 mg/kg/day. The TAF NOAEL for reproductive and early embryonic toxicity was 160 
mg/kg/day.  
Embryo-fetal development 
Oral Embryo-Fetal Development Study of TAF in Rats (Study number: TX-120-2002) 
Four  groups  of  25  pregnant  female  Crl:CD(SD)  rats  were  given  daily  doses  of  TAF  (GS-7340-02),  by  oral 
gavage,  from  gestation  day  (GD)  6  to  17,  inclusive.  Targeted  dose  levels  were  0  (vehicle  control),  25,  100 
and  250  mg/kg/day.  Dose  formulation  analysis  showed  that  each  5  mg/kg/day  animal  was  administered  a 
GS-7340-02  concentration  of  3.85  mg/mL  instead  of  5  mg/mL  for  5  to  8  days  between  GD  10  and  17, 
providing a daily dose of 19.3 mg/kg/day (77% of targeted dose) on these days. Dose formulation analysis 
showed  that  each  20  mg/kg/day  animal  was  administered  a  GS-7340-02  concentration  of  12.9  mg/mL 
instead of 20 mg/mL for 4 to 7 days between GD 6 and 12, providing a daily dose of 64.6 mg/kg/day (65% 
of targeted dose) on these days. 
At  250  mg/kg/day,  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  number  of  animals  noted  with  incomplete 
ossification of the interparietal and hyoid bones was noted at 250 mg/kg/day. Other minor skeletal anomalies 
were  comparable  in  incidence  to  controls.  At  this  dose  group,  body  weights,  body  weight  gains  and  food 
consumption were significantly decreased during the treatment period. On GD 21, the mean body weight of 
the  250  mg/kg/day  group  was  10%  lower  than  that  of  the  controls.  Mean  corrected  body  weights  (body 
weight on GD 21 minus gravid uterus weight) and  mean corrected body weight gains (body weight gain on 
GD  6  to  21  minus  gravid  uterus  weight)  were  also  lower  at  250  mg/kg/day,  with  the  corrected  mean  body 
weights  also  10%  lower  than  controls  on  GD  21.  Fetal  weights  (males,  females  and  sexes  combined)  were 
decreased dose dependently and remained within the range of historical control data. However, fetal weights 
at  250  mg/kg/day  were  at  the  lower  extreme  of  this  range.  The  incidences  of  fetal  major  malformations, 
minor external, visceral and skeletal anomalies were not affected by TAF. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 and 5 
and 6) were increased at 250 mg/kg/day.  
In summary, at 250 mg/kg/day, there was decreased fetal body weight associated with some delays in the 
rate  of  ossification.  There  was  no  evidence  of  embryo-lethality  or  teratogenicity  attributed  to  TAF  in  this 
study. The maternal TAF NOAEL and the TAF NOAEL for embryo-fetal development were both considered to 
be  100  mg/kg/day,  which  resulted  in  GD17  AUC0-t  values  of  17.4  and  0.2  μg·hr/mL  for  TFV  and  TAF, 
respectively. 
Plasma concentrations of TAF were all below the lower limit of quantitation at 25 mg/kg/day. Exposure to TAF 
increased with the increasing dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day. Exposure to TFV increased with the increase in 
TAF dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day. 
Oral Embryo-Fetal Development Study of TAF in Rabbits (TX-120-2005) 
TAF  (GS-7430-02)  was  administered  by  oral  gavage  to  time-mated  F0  generation  female  rabbits  (20  main 
study  females  per  group  and  3  toxicokinetic  females  per  group)  at  0  (vehicle  control),  10,  30  and  100

mg/kg/day.  Lower  body  weight  gains  were  noted  at  100  mg/kg/day  for  the  first  week  following  treatment 
initiation.  Lower  food  intake  was  noted  at  100  mg/kg/day  from  GD  8  to  24.  Three  animals  at  this  dose 
consumed less than 30 g for at least 4 days during the dosing period. There were no TAF-related macroscopic 
changes.  The  number  of  corpora  lutea,  implantation  sites,  live  fetuses,  dead  fetuses,  resorptions,  the  sex 
ratio  and  the  pre-  and  post-implantation  losses  were  not  affected.  There  was  no  effect  of  TAF  on  fetal 
weights.  The  incidence  of  major  malformations,  minor  external,  visceral,  skeletal  anomalies  and  common 
skeletal variants were not affected by TAF. 
Exposure to TAF increased when increasing dose (10 to 100 mg/kg/day). The increases in Cmax were greater 
than  proportional  between  10  to  100  mg/kg/day  and  the increases in  AUC0-t were  greater than  proportional 
between  30  to  100  mg/kg/day  on  GD  20.  Exposure  to  TFV  increased  with  increasing  TAF  doses  from  10  to 
100  mg/kg/day.  The  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  were  roughly  proportional  between  the  10  to  100 
mg/kg/day. Accumulation of TFV was observed after multiple dosing. 
Concentrations of TFV were higher than concentrations of TAF, indicating that TAF was extensively converted 
to TFV. The TAF NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 1.1 and 5.0 μg·h/mL for TAF and 
TFV, respectively) and the TAF NOEL  for embryo-fetal development was 100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 11.0 and 
27.3 μg·h/mL for TAF and TFV, respectively.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Based 
on 
the 
scientific 
advice 
adopted 
by 
CHMP(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/214541/2013; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1),  a  peri/postnatal  study  in  rats  is  not  required  for  TAF  registration  due  to 
the lack of TAF exposure in rats and lower TFV exposure compared to TDF. 
In  a  rat  peri-and  postnatal  reproduction  toxicity  study  conducted  with  TDF,  the  maternal  NOEL  50 
mg/kg/day.  Higher  doses  (150,  450,  and  600  mg/kg/day)  resulted  in  adverse  clinical  observations, 
reductions in body weight gain during gestation, and increases in body weight gain during lactation; and the 
450  and  600  mg/kg/day  dosages  reduced  gestation  and  lactation  feed  consumption  values.  The 
developmental  NOEL  for  TDF  was  considered  to  be  150  mg/kg/day,  as  higher  doses  (≥450  mg/kg/day) 
resulted  in  increased  peri/postpartum  pup  mortality,  reduced  pup  survival,  and  reduced  pup  body  weights. 
The  NOEL  for  general  toxicity  of  TDF  in  the  F1  generation  was  50  mg/kg/day,  as  a  result  of  mortality, 
reduced  body  weights  and/or  food  consumption  in  the  150,  450,  and  600  mg/kg/day  dose  groups.  The  F1 
generation male and female NOEL for behavioural, reproductive, and developmental toxicity of TDF was 150 
mg/kg/day  due  to  the  effects  on  sexual  maturation  that  were  observed  at  doses  of  450  and/or  600 
mg/kg/day. 
Local Tolerance  
In  a  bovine  corneal  opacity  and  permeability  assay  (BCOP)  TAF  (GS-7340-03)  elicited  an  in  vitro  irritancy 
score of 21.0 ± 8.7 with a 4-hour incubation and was predicted to be a non-corrosive/non-severe eye irritant. 
In  a  dermal  irritation  study  in  rabbits  animals  were  given  a  single  4  hour,  semi-occlusive,  dermal 
administration of approximately 0.5 g of TAF (GS-7340-03 and were observed for 4 days (Study number: TX-
120-2011). No local dermal reaction was observed in any animal throughout the duration of the study.  The 
Primary Irritation Index was calculated to be 0.0; TAF was classified as a ‘non-irritant’.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Full ERAs have been provided for FTC and RPV. The applicant has also conducted a full ERA for TAF in the 
overall assessment for the FDC. Using default values for Fpen, the PEC surface water values for FTC, RPV and 
TAF are all above the action limit of 0.01 µg/L; hence a full (Phase II) assessment was performed. In Phase 
II, Fpen refinement for the three substances has been made based on sales forecasts.  
The studies on transformation in water/sediment systems (OECD 308) show that all three active substances 
(FTC, RPV and TAF) are very persistent considering the DT50 values in sediment (FTC > 1000 days, RPV > 
1000 days, TFV: 303 days at 12°C), water (FTC: 209/81 days at 12°C) and soil (RPV: 213.3 d at 12°C). 
Furthermore FTC forms persistent transformation products M-3 (RT 2.7 min) and M-6 (RT 3.5 min) in 
sediment. In compliance with the current OECD 305 guideline, a normalisation of the BCF values to a lipid 
content of 5% is required to enhance the comparability of results. For RPV, the lipid normalized BCF values 
are below 2000, and RPV is therefore not expected to bioaccumulate. The overall conclusion of the ERA 
confirms that the FTC/RPV/TAF combination poses an acceptable risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The toxicology profiles of FTC and RPV have already been well-characterised previously.  
Prolonged PR intervals (approximately 13% to 24%) with associated QT interval prolongation were noted in 
the  39  week  dog  study  with  TAF.  No  PR  prolongation  or  any  change  in  ECG  results  occurred  in  the  safety 
pharmacology study that evaluated a TAF dose up to 100 mg/kg or in the clinical TQT study.  
At 18/12 mg/kg/day in dogs (39 week dog study), a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in some 
organs (eye [choroid plexus, ciliary body], lung, and spleen). The posterior uveitis seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day 
occurred  at  3.7-  and  17-fold  higher  exposure  to  TAF  and  TFV,  respectively,  than  that  observed  in  human 
subjects administered a 25-mg dose of TAF.  In-life  ophthalmologic examinations were  normal in this study. 
There  were  no  test  article-related  effects  on  ophthalmic  exams  or  microscopic  exams  of  ocular  tissue 
observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  mice  (up  to  13  weeks),  rats  (up  to  26  weeks),  non-human 
primates (4 weeks) or in the 4-week dog toxicology study.  It is  unlikely that  these findings would translate 
into  a  concern  regarding  the  ocular  safety  of  TAF  and  were  probably  due  to  the  poor  condition  of  these 
animals during the in-life phase of the study. However, there was one adolescent with uveitis considered to 
be  drug-related  by  the  investigator.  A  brief  description  of  these  ocular  findings  is  included  in  section  5.3  of 
the SmPC. 
Adverse degenerative (olfactory) and acute inflammatory (infiltrate neutrophil) changes in the nasal mucosa 
were noted in mice given TAF for 13 weeks. Given that these findings were not seen any other species or rats 
for  longer  durations  of  administration,  it  can  be  agreed  that  these  findings  probably  do  not  pose  a  clinical 
risk. 
In  the  rat  fertility  and  reproductive  toxicology  study,  an  increase  in  absolute  testis  weight  was  seen  at 160 
mg/kg/day. This was considered by the applicant to be test article-related but not adverse as there were no 
effects  on  other  reproductive  organ  weights  or  reproduction.  Sternebrae  variants  were  increased  at  250 
mg/kg/day  in  the  rat embryo-fetal  development  study  (the  NOEL  was  considered  to  be  100  mg/kg/day [84 
Assessment report

mg/kg/day achieved]). There were no effects seen the embryo-fetal development study in rabbits. Given no 
that  peri/postnatal  study  was  conducted  with  TAF,  the  product  literature  should  contain  the  reproductive 
findings seen with TDF (i.e. reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-postnatal toxicity studies at 
maternally toxic doses) or this omission otherwise justified using relative exposures of TFV and TFV-DP after 
TAF exposure. 
Overall,  TAF  showed  a  similar  toxicity  profile  as  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (TDF).  The  kidney  and  bone 
findings seen in the rat and dog toxicology are known toxicities of TFV.  
The  combination  of  FTC,  RPV  and  TAF  is  not  anticipated  to  exacerbate  known  toxicities  or  lead  to  new 
toxicities. Comprehensive non-clinical safety databases on these drugs, including combination toxicity studies 
with  FTC  and  TDF,  strongly  indicate  that  further  toxicological  investigations  are  unlikely  to  yield  new  data 
relevant  to  humans.  Further  studies  of  longer  duration  with  the  combination  are  not  warranted  because  of 
the  lack  of  significant  overlapping  toxicities,  and  the  use  of  additional  animals  that  would  be  required  to 
obtain such information.  
Concerns raised on the ERA have been adequately addressed by the applicant, and the overall conclusion of 
the ERA confirms that the FTC/RPV/TAF combination poses an acceptable risk to the environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major concerns have been identified from the nonclinical data. The initial concerns relating the ERA have 
been adequately addressed. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The F/R/TAF tablet provides a single tablet regimen (STR) for treatment of HIV infection. All doses reported 
below  refer  to  the  TAF  content  of  the  various  formulations  (and  not  the  equivalent  dose  of  the 
hemifumarate).  The  commercial  F/R/TAF  FDC  film-coated  tablets  were  used  in  the  pivotal  bioequivalence 
study and the other two new Phase 1 studies.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absolute bioavailability 
•  Absolute  bioavailability  has  not  been  determined  for  TAF  but  the  applicant  estimates  that  this  is 
~ 40% in the absence of P-gp inhibition or induction.  
• 
• 
FTC-110 demonstrated that the absolute bioavailability of FTC is 93%.  
The absolute bioavailability of RPV has not been documented. 
Effect of a P-gp inhibitor on TAF and TFV concentrations 
GS-US-292-0101  was  an  open-label  crossover  study  that  compared  two  formulations  of  E/C/F/TAF  each 
containing  25  or  40  mg  TAF  monofumarate  with  Stribild  (STB)  and  TAF  25  mg  alone.  Dosing  was  for  12 
days with 2-day washouts and after a meal of 550-650 kcal and 25-30% fat.  
Following  administration  of  E/C/F/TAF  25  mg  vs.  TAF  25  mg  administered  alone  the  TAF  AUClast  and  Cmax 
were  ~2.2  and  2.3-fold  higher,  respectively,  while  TFV  AUCtau  and  Cmax  were  ~3.1  and  3.7-fold  higher, 
respectively. Mean TFV exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) following TAF alone were ~90% lower compared with 
those achieved after STB. For FTC there was bioequivalence between the E/C/F/TAF formulations and STB.

Influence of food 
GS-US-311-1386 was an open-label crossover study that evaluated the effect of food on F/TAF tablets. 
Dosing was on days 1 and 8 with a single F/TAF 200/25 mg tablet in the fasted state or after a high-
calorie/high-fat meal of approximately 800 kcal and 50% fat. Administration of F/TAF under fed conditions 
resulted in a slightly lower TAF Cmax and delayed Tmax (by 30 min). In contrast the GLSM ratios for TAF 
AUCs were ~175% (90% CI ~165, 188) for the fed vs. fasted state. TFV was not measured in this study. As 
expected, FTC AUCs were unaffected by food, although slightly lower, and Cmax was clearly reduced.  
Compared to GS-US-292-0110, which assessed the PK of TAF after dosing E/C/F/TAF 10 mg STR under 
fasted and fed conditions (including the same meal type as above), the effect of food on TAF was greater 
after dosing with 200/25 mg F/TAF. The difference was thought to reflect a lesser effect of food on TAF 
absorption in the presence of P-gp inhibition by COBI. 
GS-US-366-1651 was a randomised, single-dose, 2-period, crossover, food-effect study that used F/R/TAF 
(200/25/25 mg) FDC tablets. Meals tested were ~600 kcal and 27% fat (B) and ~800-1000 kcal and 50% fat 
(C). There was intensive post-dose sampling after each dose up to 240 h. 
• 
• 
TAF AUClast increased by 45% and 53% (moderate-fat and high-calorie, high-fat conditions, 
respectively) vs. dosing in the fasted state. This magnitude of effect of the high fat meal on TAF 
plasma exposure was less for the F/R/TAF tablet compared with the F/TAF tablet (above). 
There was no important effect of food on FTC but Tmax was delayed by 1 h and Cmax reduced. 
•  RPV AUCinf increased by ~13% with treatment B and 73% with treatment C vs. dosing in the fasted 
state. Both Edurant and Eviplera are recommended to be taken with a meal.

Bioequivalence studies to support the F/R/TAF formulation 
GS-US-311-1088 was an open-label crossover study in which subjects received  F/TAF (200/25 mg) and 
FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg. Dosing was after completion of a 600 kcal and 27% fat meal. Bioequivalence was 
demonstrated for each of TAF and FTC. The CSR states that TFV levels were not reported due to failure of the 
incurred sample reliability measure. The bioanalytical report states that the QCs spiked with GS-7340 plus 
TFV showed conversion of GS-7340 to TFV so the method did not control conversion effectively, particularly 
when the GS-7340:TFV ratio was high. 
GS-US-311-1473 was a large (>100 subject) open-label crossover study which compared F/TAF (200/25 
mg) with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg. Dosing was after completion of a 600 kcal and 27% fat meal. Bioequivalence was 
demonstrated for each of TAF (i.e. between 25 mg in F/TAF and 10 mg in E/C/F/TAF) and FTC. TFV was not 
measured. 
GS-US-366-1159 is the pivotal bioequivalence study supporting this application. This was an open-label 3-
way crossover study in which subjects received single doses of the following in randomised order and with 
12-day washout periods: 
A: FTC/RPV/TAF (200/25/25 mg) FDC tablet  
B: RPV 25 mg tablet  
C: E/C/F/TAF (150/150/200/10 mg) FDC tablet  
All dosing was within 30 minutes after the start of a standardised breakfast containing ~600 kcal and 27% 
fat and within 5 minutes of meal completion. Bioequivalence criteria were met for each of FTC, RPV and TAF. 
Plasma TFV was not measured in this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 71/120 
  
  
 
GS-US-264-0103 was a 3-way crossover study that provides data on co-administration of RPV and FTC with 
TDF compared to two test formulations of the FTC/RPV/TDF FDC. This study did not include separate dosing 
with each constituent but it does provide TFV and FTC plasma levels on dosing with RPV that can be 
compared with the typical range observed with other FTC/TDF-containing presentations. All dosing was within 
5 minutes of completing a standardised breakfast (400 kcal and 13 g fat).  Bioequivalence criteria were met 
except for RPV Cmax after the F4 test formulation. 
To put these data for TFV and FTC into context, the assessor compared plasma exposures to TFV and FTC 
that were provided by the applicant during the assessment of Stribild, which is also taken with food due to 
effects on EVG and COBI. The TFV AUC and Cmax values documented above fall within the range observed in 
prior studies in healthy subjects and HIV-infected patients treated with Stribild. The FTC AUC and Cmax 
resemble the values observed in healthy subjects given Truvada.   
Excretion and metabolism 
In GS-US-120-0109 healthy male volunteers received a single TAF 25 mg capsule containing 24.15 mg TAF 
plus 100 μCi [0.85 mg] radiolabeled [14C]TAF after a standardised breakfast. The total mean (± SD) 
recovery of [14C]radioactivity in faeces plus urine (n=7) was 84.4% (± 2.45%). The percent of radioactive 
dose recovered from faeces was 47.2% (± 4.62%) and the percent recovered from urine was 36.2% (± 
5.62%).

Quantifiable levels of [14C]radioactivity were observed in whole blood for up to 360 h post-dose in most 
subjects but quantifiable levels of TAF were observed in plasma for up to 6 h post-dose and then remained 
BLQ. TAF was extensively metabolised with only 1.41% (± 0.561%) of the total radioactive dose appearing in 
urine as TAF and no radioactive TAF was detected in faeces. TFV accounted for 99% of the radioactivity 
recovered in faeces and 86% of the radioactivity recovered in urine. At 2 h post-dose the predominant 
species was TAF, accounting for 72.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity quantified. At 24 to 48 h post-dose the 
predominant species was uric acid, accounting for 97.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity quantified. Low 
quantities of other metabolites were formed including xanthine, hypoxanthine and adenine (identical to the 
endogenous products of purine metabolism). 
For pooled urine a mean of 25.8% (± 5.50%) of the radioactive dose was quantified, within which the 
predominant species was TFV (M12), accounting for 22.2% (± 4.47%). All other metabolites appeared in 
trace amounts and none exceeded 2% of the administered dose of radioactivity. For pooled faeces a mean of 
31.7% (± 10.5%) of the radioactive dose was quantified, within which the predominant species was TFV 
(M12), accounting for 31.4% (± 10.4%). Two unidentified metabolites appeared in trace amounts. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
POPPK analyses were performed for TAF and TFV using PK data collected from E/C/F/TAF studies as reported 
in full in the previous assessment reports. Since the applicant proposed use of F/R/TAF from the age of 12 
years and 35 kg the PK data from the E/C/F/TAF study GS-US-292-0106 and the RPV study C213 (PAINT; 
which previously supported the Edurant variation II/17G) were provided. Plasma exposures to TAF, TFV, FTC 
and RPV were concluded to be comparable between adults and adolescents.  
The POPPK predicted values were also comparable between adolescents and adults.

Impaired renal function 
TAF study GS-US-120-0108 
A single 25 mg dose of TAF was administered to 14 subjects with severe renal impairment (15 ≤ CrCL ≤ 29 
mL/min) and 13 matched controls. 
In severe renal impairment there was a 92% (< 2-fold) higher mean plasma TAF AUCinf, 92% higher AUClast 
and 79% higher Cmax. Correspondingly the mean plasma TAF CL/F was lower (61,717.8 mL/h vs. 117,633.1 
mL/h, respectively, p = 0.003) but the half-life was not statistically significantly different. At 1 and 4 h the 
mean percent unbound TAF was not different between those with severe renal impairment (20.0% and

14.2%) vs. controls (20.1% and 13.6%). Approximately 0.117 mg TAF (0.47% of the dose) was excreted in 
urine in renally impaired subjects vs. ~0.500 mg (2.00%) in controls with renal clearance of 4.2 mL/min and 
35.8 mL/min, respectively. 
In severe renal impairment there was much higher (about 5-6-fold) plasma exposure to TFV vs. controls with 
lower plasma and renal clearance but no significant difference in half-life. TFV plasma protein binding at 2 
and 24 h was not different between groups (e.g. 99.2% vs. 98.9% at 24 h). Approximately 30% vs. 24% of 
the dose was excreted in urine. The plasma TFV exposures (mean TFV AUCinf 2073.8 ng•h/mL vs. 342.6 
ng•h/mL for controls) were within or below the TFV exposure ranges of subjects with normal renal function 
taking TDF 300 mg once daily 
E/C/F/TAF study GS-US-292-0112  
This open-label study in HIV-infected patients with eGFRCG in the range 30-69 mL/min included an intensive 
PK/PD sub-study.  
• 
• 
• 
TAF PK parameters were consistent with data obtained from HIV-infected patients with normal renal 
function in E/C/F/TAF studies as well as from healthy subjects (AUClast 244.8 ng*h/mL). Exposure to 
TAF was numerically higher in those with baseline eGFRCG < 50 vs. ≥ 50 mL/min but it was less than 
the mean AUClast (510.6 ng*h/mL) in subjects with eGFRCG 15-29 mL/min in GS-US-120-0108. 
TFV plasma levels were higher in those with screening eGFRCG 30 to 69 mL/min compared to the 
HIV-infected patients in E/C/F/TAF studies (mean TFV AUCtau 552.7 ng*h/mL vs. 326.2, 311.8 and 
286.2 ng*h/mL; see section 2.1.8 above) but well below the TFV exposure in those with eGFRCG 15-
29 mL/min in GS-US-120-0108 (mean AUCinf 2073.8 ng*h/mL) and after TDF-containing regimens. 
As expected, exposure to TFV was higher in those with baseline eGFRCG < 50 vs. ≥ 50 mL/min. 
FTC plasma levels were higher in those with screening eGFRCG 30 to 69 mL/min compared to the 
Phase 2 E/C/F/TAF patients (mean AUCtau 20,968 ng*h/mL vs. 11,714.1 ng*h/mL).  
Impaired hepatic function 
TAF study GS-US-120-0114 
This was an open-label study in which single doses of 25 mg TAF were administered after completion of a 
moderate-fat meal (600 calories, 27% fat). The plasma exposure parameters of TAF and TFV were 
considered to be comparable between subjects with mild hepatic impairment and matched controls. The 
lower exposures vs. controls were not considered to be clinically relevant. In those with moderate hepatic 
impairment the plasma exposure parameters for TAF were slightly higher and exposures to TFV were slightly 
lower vs. matched controls. The differences observed were not considered to be clinically relevant. TAF 
plasma protein binding at 1 and 4 h post-dose showed a mean unbound TAF range from 16% to 19% in mild 
hepatic impairment and from 14% to 23% in moderate hepatic impairment. TFV plasma protein binding at 2 
and 24 h post-dose showed a mean unbound TFV of > 99% in mild or moderate hepatic impairment. For TAF 
and TFV binding was similar to controls.  
Race 
In the E/C/F/TAF study GS-US-292-0108 after multiple dosing: 
• 
• 
The AUCs of all analytes were lower in Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects.  
For FTC the lower bounds of the 90% CI were well below 80% for AUCtau and Ctau.

Interactions 
In vitro 
•  At TAF concentrations up to 25 μM all IC50 values were > 25 µM except for CYP3A4. TAF showed 
weak inhibition of CYP3A-mediated oxidation of midazolam or testosterone with IC50 values of 7.6 or 
7.4 µM, respectively. 
•  At 10 µM TAF the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- and 8.3-fold, which 
correspond to 3% and 6% of the induction levels observed with respective positive controls. TAF 
showed little or no potential for CYP induction at clinically relevant concentration (1 µM).  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TAF did not inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM. 
There was no significant induction of P-gp and UGT1A1 mRNA on exposure to TAF. 
TAF showed weak inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1 and MATE1 but none was inhibited 
by 50% at 100 µM TAF, which is approximately 200-fold Cmax in plasma. 
TAF is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. An increase in TAF absorption was observed in the presence of 
efflux transport inhibitors CsA or COBI. Co-administration of TAF with efflux inhibitors may potentiate 
antiviral efficacy by increasing TFV-DP levels in PBMCs.  
TAF is also a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Exposure to TAF may be affected by inhibitors of 
these transporters or genetic polymorphisms affecting activities.  
TAF was not a substrate for OAT1 and OAT3. 
•  At 50 µM TAF the extent of activation of PXR was only 23% of the maximal effect of rifampicin and 15 
μM TAF demonstrated activation of < 5% of the maximal induction elicited by rifampicin.  
• 
• 
• 
TAF did not activate AhR up to 50 µM, the highest concentration tested.  
TFV at 100 μM did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A.  
The active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by human OAT1 (basolateral uptake) and MRP4 
(apical efflux) transporters acting in series in proximal tubules. Human OAT3 may play a secondary 
role in the tubular uptake of TFV.  
•  Under physiologically relevant conditions, none of the tested drugs affected OAT1-mediated transport 
of TFV. 
• 
TFV did not inhibit the activity of human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 > 300 μM).

In vivo 
GS-US-311-0101 - F/TAF with Efavirenz [EFV] and TAF with COBI 
Although F/R/TAF is not anticipated to be given with these agents the effects of co-administration are of 
interest for assessing the wider risk of DDIs.  
• 
FTC/TAF (40 mg) plus EFV resulted in no clinically relevant changes in FTC, TFV or TAF AUCs 
compared with FTC/TAF (40 mg) dosed alone based on the pre-defined acceptance criteria. The TAF 
and TFV Cmax values were lower on co-administration but the differences were not considered to be 
clinically meaningful. 
•  Co-administration of TAF 8 mg plus COBI 150 mg resulted in substantially higher TAF and TFV 
exposures relative to TAF 8 mg dosed alone. The applicant ascribed the effect to COBI-mediated 
inhibition of P-gp-mediated intestinal secretion of TAF.  
GS-US-311-1387 – F/TAF with carbamazepine 
The study evaluated the effect of steady-state carbamazepine (CBZ) on the PK of TAF and TFV. Subjects 
received a single dose of F/TAF (200/25 mg) and a second dose with CBZ at steady-state (titrated from 100 
mg twice daily to 300 mg twice daily over 20 days) with food. When co-administered with CBZ 300 mg at 
steady-state, TAF AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax decreased by approximately 54%, 55% and 57%, respectively, 
compared with administration of F/TAF FDC alone. A lesser decrease in TFV exposure was observed on co-
administration such that AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax decreased by approximately 23%, 25%, and 30%, 
respectively.

TAF had no significant effect on plasma MDZ or 1’OH-MDZ after oral dosing based on 90% CI that fell 
within 80, 125%. The 90% CI for MDZ AUCs were slightly higher on co-administration (did not span 
100%) but the metabolite was not similarly affected. 
TAF had no significant effect on plasma MDZ or 1’OH-MDZ after IV dosing based on 90% CI that fell 
within 80, 125% but the 90% CI for MDZ and metabolite AUCs did not span 100%. 
There was 25% to 30% decrease in TAF Cmax (25% to 30%) after co-administration with oral or IV 
MDZ, which the Company proposed may reflect an effect of MDZ on gastrointestinal motility. The 
AUCs were also slightly lower on co-administration but relatively less affected (~10-15% decreases). 
GS-US-120-0117 – Single doses of TAF + RPV 
This was an open-label crossover study to evaluate co-administration of TAF with rilpivirine (RPV), which is 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A but is not expected to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or P-gp at 25 mg QD.   
• 
• 
• 
Plasma TAF was unaffected by RPV in that all 90% CI fell within 80, 125% and spanned 100%.  
The TFV Cmax and AUC were slightly higher on co-administration with 90% CI around AUC ratios that 
did not span 100% and with a Cmax ratio of 118.1 and 90% CI 107.3, 130.   
The RPV Cmax and AUCs were slightly lower on co-administration with lower bounds of the 90% CI 
just below or at 80%. Clast (at 120 h) was not affected (9.2 ng/mL vs. 10 ng/mL) and mean 
concentrations did not diverge at earlier time points.  
GS-US-120-1554 – Multiple doses of TAF + RPV 
This was an open-label study in two cohorts who received 14 days of either TAF 25 mg or RPV 25 mg and all 
subjects also received both together after standardised breakfasts.  
• 
• 
• 
Plasma PK parameters for TAF were unaffected by co-administration. 
For TFV the 90% CI fell within 80, 125% but all exceeded 100%.  
The RPV AUC was unaffected by co-administration whilst Cmax was slightly lower and Ctau was 
slightly higher. 
GS-US-366-1689 - F/R/TAF plus sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LDV) 
This was an open label, multiple-dose, 3-way cross-over study to evaluate the potential for interactions 
between the F/R/TAF FDC and SOF, its metabolites (GS-566500 and GS-311007) or LDV. All dosing was with 
food.  
Co-administration with LDV/SOF did not notably affect the PK of FTC, RPV or TAF. Compared to FTC/RPV/TAF 
alone co-administration led to increases in TAF and TFV AUCtau of 32% and 75%, respectively. TFV Cmax was 
increased by 62% and Ctau by 85% but there was no effect on TAF Cmax. Co-administration with F/R/TAF did 
not notably affect the PK of LDV or SOF (including its metabolites GS-566500 or GS-331007).  
The applicant discussed that the increase in TFV (the major TAF metabolite) exposures of approximately 75% 
was consistent with the mechanistic understanding of the interaction between the P-gp inhibitor LDV and the 
P-gp substrate TAF. It was pointed out that the mean TFV AUCtau on co-administration (467 ng*hr/mL) is 
approximately 5 times lower than TFV exposure following dosing with TDF (AUCtau 2290 ± 690 ng*hr/mL). As 
such, the differences in overall TFV exposure following administration of LDV/SOF+FTC/RPV/TAF vs. 
Assessment report

FTC/RPV/TAF alone were not considered to be clinically relevant and no dose adjustment of FTC/RPV/TAF is 
proposed when it is co-administered with LDV/SOF. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
TAF  is  predominantly  hydrolysed  to  TFV  by  Cathepsin  A  (CatA)  cleavage  in  target  lymphoid  cells.  TFV  (a 
monophosphate) is then metabolised to TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP), which is a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 
RT. In T-cells, macrophages and PBMCs TAF EC50 values ranged from 3 to 14 nM. The in-vitro activity of TAF 
against  HIV-1  is  100-  to  600-fold  greater  than  TFV  and  4-  to  6-fold  greater  than  TDF.  For  TAF  intracellular 
activation pathways in lymphoid cells and tissues, refer to Figure 1. 
Since  TAF  is  a  pro-drug  of  TFV  it  is  affected  by  the  same  resistance  associated  mutations  (RAMs).  In-vitro 
studies indicated that TAF and TFV have similar propensities to select for mutational resistance and that EC50 
values  are  affected  to  a  similar  extent  by  various  mutations  and  combinations  of  mutations.  However,  the 
applicant postulated that the in-vivo resistance profile may differ when dosing with TAF or TDF since the level 
of TFV-DP achieved after TAF is significantly higher than that after TDF.  
Viral  breakthrough  experiments  were  conducted  using  known  TDF-resistant  HIV-1  isolates  in  MT-2  cells  to 
model  the  impact  of  the  higher  TFV-DP  concentrations.  These  experiments  were  conducted  at  a  higher 
multiplicity  of  infection  (MOI)  compared  to  typical  EC50  assays;  the  EC50  values  for  TAF  and  TFV  were  0.02 
and  5  µM,  respectively.  The  cells  were  incubated  in  the  presence  of  TAF  or  TFV  (concentrations  were 
equivalent to the EC95 [estimated at 10 × EC50] with a 5-fold increase for TAF) followed by HIV-1 infection. 
After 4 or 5 days of incubation cultures were scored for viral breakthrough (i.e., CPE) and the procedure was 
repeated  every  4  to  5  days  for  up  to  4 weeks.  TAF  inhibited  viral  breakthrough  for  the  duration  of  the 
experiment for 9/11 viruses but viral breakthrough was only inhibited for 2/11 viruses in the presence of TFV. 
However, breakthrough of viruses with 5 TAMs was not prevented by TAF or TFV.

Tolerance, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of GS-7340-02 in Antiretroviral-Naïve Patients Who Are 
Chronically Infected with HIV-1 
This study explored the antiviral activity of TAF (50 mg and 150 mg QD as the monofumarate) vs. TDF during 
14 days monotherapy in 30 ARV-naïve patients (27 male) with plasma HIV-1  RNA ≥ 15,000 copies/mL and 
CD4  cell  count  ≥  200  cells/mm3  at  screening.  TFV  was  detectable  within  PBMCs  earlier,  more  consistently, 
and  at  greater  concentrations  after  TAF  vs.  TDF.  DAVG1,  2  and  3  were  all  significantly  greater  in  the  TAF 
groups compared to TDF but there was no significant difference between the TAF doses.

copies/mL, CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and without use of ARVs within 90 days. Randomisation (2:2:2:1:2) 
was to TAF at 8, 25 or 40 mg or to TDF 300 mg or placebo. At steady state, the mean TFV AUCtau after TAF

doses  were  97%,  86%  and  79%  lower,  respectively,  vs.  the  mean  after  TDF dosing  and  Cmax  values were 
98%, 94% and 89% lower, respectively.  
The peripheral blood mononuclear cell TFV-DP concentrations were highly variable but the mean AUCtau was 
similar between TAF 8 mg and TDF 300 mg and was ~ 7-fold and ~ 25-fold higher after 25 mg and 40 mg 
doses  of  TAF,  respectively.  The  antiviral  effect  of  GS-7340  8  mg  was  similar  to that  of  TDF  300  mg.  There 
were statistically significantly greater decreases in viral load with 25 mg and 40 mg TAF doses compared to 
TDF 300 mg. The first phase decay slopes for plasma HIV-1 RNA in the TAF 25 mg and 40 mg groups were 
also significantly steeper than for TDF 300 mg.

The PK/PD relationships between TAF and TFV plasma exposures and antiviral activity were explored using a 
maximum (PD) effect (Emax) model. The TAF AUC fitted well with an Emax model, with an Emax of ~1.7 to 1.8 
log10  decline  from  baseline  and  the  EC50  for  AUC  of  ~32  ng•h/mL.  A  similar  fit/Emax  estimate  was  obtained 
using TAF Cmax, which was somewhat expected given its brief plasma half-life and the resulting contribution 
of the Cmax to the overall AUC. Upon comparison of antiviral activity with 40 mg and previous data with 150 
mg (GS-120-1101), TAF 25 mg was expected to provide near-maximal activity (~1.7 to 1.8 log10 copies/mL). 
Plasma  TFV  exposure,  which  was  substantially  lower  with  TAF  versus  TDF,  did  not  correlate  with  antiviral 
activity.

Phase  3  E/C/F/TAF  studies  provided  intracellular  TFV-DP  concentrations  following  administration  of  TAF  vs. 
TDF (i.e., E/C/F/TAF vs. STB) in HIV-infected patients. There was a >4-fold higher intracellular concentration 
of TFV-DP (based on the AUCtau GLSM ratio) when TAF was given vs. TDF.  
The PK/PD analysis sets included all ARV-naïve patients who received a dose of E/C/F/TAF and had at least 
one  TAF  or  TFV  PK  parameter  (AUCtau  or  Cmax)  estimated  from  the  POPPK  analysis.  Virologic  success  was 
uniformly high across TAF AUCtau quartiles with no trends in exposure-response relationship observed.

These results based on TAF 10 mg when given with COBI (or other agent with similar PK effects on TAF) are 
of  relevance  to  the  unboosted  dose  of  TAF  25 mg,  which  was  concluded  to  provide  near  maximal  antiviral 
efficacy in the monotherapy study.  
The  data  were  also  used  to  explore  the  exposure-safety  relationships  in  these  two  studies,  focusing  on 
diarrhoea and nausea (very common), vomiting and GI/abdominal pain (common). 
• 
• 
For diarrhoea and GI/abdominal pain, both the TAF and TFV exposure was comparable regardless of 
the presence or absence of either of those symptoms and no exposure-AE trends were observed. 
For nausea and vomiting, the TFV exposure was comparable regardless of the presence or absence of 
either  of  those  symptoms  with  no  exposure-AE  trends  noted.  Logistic  regression  analysis  showed  a 
trend between the highest TAF exposure and the presence of these AEs (nausea correlated with the 
highest  4%  of  TAF  exposure;  vomiting  correlated  with  the  highest  19% of  TAF  exposure).  No  trend 
was observed between TAF exposure and severity. 
•  Across all TAF and TFV AUCtau quartiles, the percentage change from baseline at Week 48 in BMD was 
comparable; no trends in exposure-changes in BMD were noted. 
•  Across all TAF and TFV AUCtau quartiles, the maximum increase from baseline in serum creatinine was 
comparable; no trends in exposure-changes in serum creatinine were noted. 
GS-US-311-1089 
Further data on intracellular TFV-DP concentrations were provided from an ongoing study GS-US-311-1089 in 
which  patients  who  are  virologically  suppressed  on  regimens  containing  FTC/TDF  either  switch  to  F/TAF  or 
stay  on  FTC/TDF  and  are  followed  for  48  weeks.  The  report  is  based  on  trough  blood  samples  collected  at 
Week 4 (20 to 24 h post-dose). Overall, F/TAF resulted in intracellular TFV-DP concentrations >4-fold those 
observed with FTC/TDF.

Further breakdowns according to co-administered agents, noting the variable denominators, showed:

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
TFV is presented for clinical use as a nucleotide analogue, i.e. it is already monophosphorylated. The effects 
of combination of TFV with other agents that require intracellular phosphorylation has been investigated in in-
vitro  studies.  Combination  with  ABC  did  not  change the  rates  of  phosphorylation  of  either  compound  to the 
triphosphate (active) forms.  
The anti-HIV-1 activity of TAF in combination with a broad panel of representatives from the major classes of 
approved  anti-HIV  agents  was  evaluated  in  HIV-1  IIIB  infected  MT-2  cells.  TAF  exhibited  moderate  to  high 
synergistic effects (synergy scores from 41 to 131) when combined with any of the N(t)RTIs or NNRTIs. None 
of the drug combinations containing TAF exhibited antagonistic antiviral effects. The combination of FTC, RPV 
and TFV demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity in cell culture. 
Secondary pharmacology 
GS-US-120-0107 was a TQT study that evaluated single doses of 25 mg and 125 mg TAF.  Pharmacokinetic 
parameters for TAF and TFV following single oral doses of 25 or 125 mg TAF were approximately proportional 
to dose. The lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference between moxifloxacin and placebo 
was  >  5  ms  at  2  post-dose  time  points  (3  and  4  h)  establishing  assay  sensitivity.  At  these  respective  time 
points  the  actual  changes  were  -1.4  and  +4.1  ms  for  moxifloxacin  compared  to  -12.9  and  -7.1  ms  for 
placebo.  
For the primary analysis, TAF was concluded to have no QTcF prolongation effect as the upper bounds of the 
2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference between 25 mg and 125 mg TAF and placebo were below 10 ms at 
each  time  point  after  dosing.  Small  negative  changes  in  QTcF  were  observed  at  both  doses.  Analyses  of 
secondary endpoints (QTcB, QTcN and QTcI) were consistent with the primary analysis. 
In the categorical analyses no subject had a treatment-emergent absolute QTc interval > 500 ms or a change 
from  pre-dose  baseline  QTc  >  60  ms  with  any  correction  factor  following  any  treatment.  No  subject  had  a 
treatment-emergent absolute QTc interval > 480 ms or a change from pre-dose baseline > 30 ms following 
either dose of TAF.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Doses of TAF, FTC and RPV in F/R/TAF  
The evidence to support selection of 25 mg TAF once daily in the absence of an inhibitor or inducer of P-gp 
comes from the monotherapy studies. Doses of 25 mg and 40 mg TAF achieved effects on viral load similar 
to those of 50 mg and 150 mg in the preliminary study, suggesting a plateau effect from ~25 mg upwards 
and superiority over TDF 300 mg. It was clear that 8 mg TAF was not an appropriate dose. Doses between 8 
and 25 mg were not studied.  
The  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cell  TFV-DP  concentrations  were  highly  variable  across  dose  groups  and 
time points in the monotherapy and other studies in which data were generated. Differences among studies 
are expected given the technical challenges associated with the assessment of intracellular nucleotide levels, 
including  TFV-DP  in  PBMCs.  For  example,  there  is  currently  no  GLP  standard  for  PBMC  collection,  and 
haemolysis during sample collection may adversely affect quantification. Accurate counting of PBMCs is also 
technically difficult and PBMCs are variably contaminated with RBCs, which can contain significant quantities 
of  nucleotide  analogues.  Additionally,  dephosphorylation  may  occur  during  cell  collection  and  isolation. 
Potential  variances  in  the  application  of  PBMC  processing  procedure  at  different  clinical  trial  sites  may 
contribute to the observed differential TFV-DP concentrations. 
However, within any one study it seems that the quantitative differences in TFV-DP concentrations between 
TDF  and  TAF  treatment  groups  are  most  likely  real  even  if  the  absolute  values  reported  differ  between 
studies due to the inherent variance in the technical assessment of TFV-DP levels. It is notable then that in 
the monotherapy study the intracellular PBMC concentrations of TFV-DP were ~ 7-fold and ~ 25-fold higher 
after  25  mg  and  40  mg  doses  of  TAF,  respectively,  vs.  TDF.  Thus  there  was  a  lack  of  linearity  with  dose. 
Despite  this  apparent  difference  in  intracellular  TFV-DP  the  40  mg  dose  of  TAF  did  not  have  a  superior 
antiviral  effect  to  25  mg. Since  the  antiviral  effect  should  carry  more  weight,  the  TAF  monotherapy  studies 
support a conclusion that doses lower than 25 mg should not be pursued and that increasing the dose beyond 
25 mg is unlikely to achieve a greater antiviral effect.  
To further support the selection of the 25 mg TAF dose the applicant provided the results of Emax modelling. 
The models gave an Emax of ~1.7 to 1.8 log 10 decline in viral load from baseline. The EC50 approximated to a 
TAF  AUC  of  ~32  ng•h/mL.  After  10  days  dosing  with  TAF  25  mg  alone  the  mean  and  median  TAF  AUClast 
values were 115 and 109 ng.h/mL, respectively. It was concluded that 25 mg TAF will provide near maximal 
activity.  It  is  important  to  note  that  there  was  no  relationship  detected  between  plasma  TFV  and  antiviral 
activity.  
The observation of higher levels of TFV-DP in PBMCs after dosing with TAF 25 mg compared to TDF 300 mg is 
not  mechanistically  explained.  However,  TAF  is  a  more  stable  prodrug  than  TDF  and  it  is  more  efficiently 
loaded into PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV-target cells), although the mechanism of cell uptake 
is  not  known.  Due  to  its  poor  cellular  permeability,  plasma  TFV  does  not  meaningfully  contribute  to 
intracellular levels of TFV-DP in patients receiving F/R/TAF. This is supported by the kinetic profile of TFV-DP 
in  PBMCs  since  TFV-DP  accumulates  rapidly  after  dosing,  when  plasma  TAF  levels  are  still  high,  and  are 
maintained based on its long intracellular half-life. Additionally, the TAF AUC fitted well with an Emax model 
but TFV exposure did not correlate with antiviral activity.  
The  slight  deviation  from  dose  proportionality  in  TAF  and  TFV  plasma  levels  observed  in  the  negative  TQT 
study  for  25  vs.  125  mg  TAF  over  the  5-fold  range  tested  suggests  that  uptake  of  TAF  into  cells  and 
conversion to TFV was not easily saturable.

There is no evidence to suggest that substitution of TDF with TAF in the FDC will increase the risk of selection 
of  resistance.  Also,  in-vitro  studies  with  FTC  and  TAF  indicated  synergy,  suggesting  no  intracellular 
interference in formation of their respective phosphorylated active moieties.  
Overall,  the  applicant’s  rationale  for  pursuing  a  TAF  dose  of  25  mg  once  daily  in  the  absence  of  a  P-gp 
inhibitor can be supported. Based on the multiple dose DDI study that showed no interaction between TAF 25 
mg  and  RPV  25  mg,  the  known  lack  of  interaction  potential  of  FTC,  and  the  bioequivalence  study  that 
compared  F/R/TAF  with  Edurant,  the  selection  of  the  licensed  doses  of  FTC  and  RPV  in  the  F/R/TAF  FDC  is 
supported. The resulting FDC differs from the approved FDC Eviplera only in substitution of TDF with TAF. 
The doses of FTC and RPV in the proposed F/R/TAF FDC are those approved in the standalone presentations 
and also in the approved FDC Eviplera. A lack of interaction between TAF and RPV was shown in the multiple 
dose  DDI  study.  A  definitive  study  that  compares  F/R/TAF  with  each  component  dosed  alone  has  not  been 
conducted but FTC does not have any potential to affect exposures to TAF, TFV or RPV.  
Effect of food 
After dosing the F/R/TAF FDC with food the TAF AUClast was increased by 53% (high-calorie/high-fat; AUClast 
312  vs.  201  ng.h/mL  fasted).  The  magnitude  of  effect  of  the  high  fat  meal  on  TAF  was  less  than  that 
observed  after  dosing  with  the  F/TAF  tablet  under  similar  conditions  (75%)  in  another  study  (GS-US-311-
1386;  AUClast  235  fed  vs.  134  ng.h/mL  fasted).  Although  these  data  come  from  two  different  studies  the 
actual  TAF  AUClast  values  were  notably  lower  for  F/TAF  vs.  F/R/TAF  when  each  was  dosed  with  or  without 
food.  It  is  also  relevant  to  note  that  the  food  effect  study  for  E/C/F/TAF  (GS-US-292-0110)  showed  only  a 
small effect of a similar meal on TAF AUClast (240 vs. 206 ng.h/mL fasted) in the presence of a strong P-gp 
inhibitor (COBI). In addition, it is interesting that the TAF AUClast value in the fasted state after dosing with 
E/C/F/TAF (10 mg TAF) is very close to that observed in the fasted state for F/R/TAF (25 mg TAF) and, again, 
notably higher than after dosing F/TAF (25 mg) in the fasted state.   
The magnitudes of effect of food on TAF AUCs when dosed as F/R/TAF vs. F/TAF and the differences in actual 
AUC  values  in  each  of  fed  and  fasted  states  could  suggest  that  RPV  dosed  at  25  mg  does  have  some 
inhibitory effect on gut P-gp, which increases TAF absorption. In this regard it should be noted that the DDI 
study  that  concluded  no  effect  of  RPV  on  P-gp  was  conducted  with  digoxin,  which  is  not  the  most  sensitive 
substrate. 
After dosing with F/R/TAF, the RPV AUC inf increased by ~13% with the moderate fat meal and 73% with the 
high  fat  meal  vs.  dosing  in  the  fasted  state.  However,  the  effect  on  TAF  AUClast  was  not  very  different 
between  the  two  types  of  meal  (44%  vs.  53%).  These  data  do  not  suggest  that  there  is  a  relationship 
between the  systemic  exposure  to  RPV  and  TAF  exposure  but this  does  not  rule out  an  underlying effect  of 
RPV on P-gp-mediated TAF absorption in the gut.  
Both  Edurant  and  Eviplera  are  recommended  to  be  taken  with  a  meal  and  the  SmPC  recommends  that 
F/R/TAF is also taken with a meal. This recommendation is considered appropriate. It is relevant to note that 
the pivotal bioequivalence study was conducted with all dosing after a meal of ~600 kcal and 27% fat, which 
is the moderate fat meal tested in the F/R/TAF food effect study. This design could seem to be acceptable but 
it  remains  the  case  that  the  bioequivalence  criteria  may  not  have  been  fully  met  if  this  study  had  been 
conducted in the fasted state or after a high fat meal.  
As expected from prior data, there was no important effect of food on FTC. Therefore the recommendation to 
dose F/R/TAF with food is driven by the RPV and TAF content of the FDC.   
Bridging to the E/C/F/TAF and RPV efficacy data 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016

The  pivotal  study  to  bridge  the  efficacy  observed  with  E/C/F/TAF  and  RPV  in  the  ART-naïve  to  F/R/TAF 
(200/25/25  mg)  was  conducted  with  all  dosing  in  the  fed  state  after  standard  moderate  fat  meals.  The 
requisite  bioequivalence  criteria  were  met.  The  TAF  AUClast  values  were  250  and  238  ng.h/mL  for  F/R/TAF 
and  E/C/F/TAF,  respectively.  These  values  are  very  similar  to  those  reported  above  after  dosing  each  FDC 
with the same moderate fat meal type in the food effect studies.   
These data were generated in healthy subjects. Therefore it is pertinent to observe that in the POPPK analysis 
based on the E/C/F/TAF studies the applicant concluded that HIV disease status did not have an effect on TAF 
exposure  and  was  not  a  statistically  significant  or  clinically  relevant  covariate.  The  estimated  TAF  AUClast 
values were 250 ng.h/mL for healthy subjects vs. 206 ng.h/mL for HIV-infected patients, noting that patients 
were to take E/C/F/TAF with food. In the additional integrated ad hoc PK analysis in the F/TAF dossier, from 
which the applicant again concluded that there was no clinically relevant difference in TAF exposure between 
healthy subjects and HIV-infected patients, the estimated TAF AUClast  was 127 ng.h/mL for TAF 25 mg. This 
resembles the value observed with this dose in the TAF monotherapy studies. 
There are no patient PK data available as yet after dosing with the F/R/TAF FDC although such data will be 
collected and reported from two ongoing studies in which virologically suppressed patients switch to F/R/TAF. 
There  were  too  few  patients  treated  with  F/TAF  25  mg  +  RPV  in  GS-US-311-1089  to  substantiate  patient 
plasma levels and intracellular TFV-DP with this combination regimen. 
During the procedure several questions were raised regarding the validity of bridging efficacy on the basis of 
bioequivalence as described above. In the Phase 1 study GS-US-292-103 plasma TAF was very slightly lower 
on  dosing  with  Genvoya  but  the  plasma  TFV  AUC  was  lower  after  dosing  with  F/TAF  25  mg.  This  finding, 
which remains mechanistically unexplained, suggested an effect of COBI on the compartmental disposition of 
TFV.  
o  The  finding  raised  a  question  regarding  the  basis  for  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  Genvoya  to  F/TAF 
regardless of the third agent co-administered (i.e., including F/R/TAF).  
o 
It  also  raised  a  question  regarding  the  CNS  levels  of  TFV-DP  that  may  be  achieved  with  F/TAF,  and, 
hence, the efficacy of various TAF-containing regimens (including F/R/TAF) against HIV within the CNS.  
The applicant responded to these concerns during the procedure and the questions were referred to the SAG 
Viral Diseases. When considering these issues the following observations have some relevance. 
To ascribe the difference in TFV plasma levels that was observed when TAF was administered with or without 
COBI to a differential effect on the whole body distribution of TFV would require that systemic concentrations 
of COBI are sufficient to exert effects on relevant transporters outside of the gut.   
In vitro, COBI inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MRP-2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Its effect on 
plasma exposures to substrates of P-gp and/or BCRP via inhibition at the gut level is clear. There are modest 
changes in TFV exposure when TDF (a known substrate of P-gp) is given with inhibitors of intestinal P-gp, 
including COBI and RTV. In addition, COBI is predicted to inhibit intestinal BCRP and MRP2 at concentrations 
theoretically achievable in the intestinal lumen following a 150 mg oral dose. The results of a study to 
evaluate whether MRP2 or BCRP could contribute to the intestinal efflux transport of TDF were submitted 
during the evaluation of the Tybost dossier and indicated that this could occur. However, in the context of 
plasma TFV levels after oral administration of TAF, it should be noted that TFV is not a substrate for P-gp, 
MRP2 or BCRP and its renal elimination should not be affected by COBI based on the calculated 
Cmax,u/IC50 ratios.  
Regarding the potential for systemic effects on other transporters it is clear that COBI reaches sufficient 
concentrations to inhibit MATE1 in the kidney, with consequent effects on serum creatinine. It is also 
predicted to have weak to modest effects resulting in increased exposures to OATP1B substrates. In the 
Assessment report

interaction study with digoxin, in which Cmax and AUC0−last increased but AUCinf remained unchanged on co-
administration, there was a numerical decrease in the digoxin t1/2 from 38 to 30 h, which was unexpected in 
light of the calculations described above suggesting that COBI would not reach sufficient systemic 
concentrations to inhibit renal P-gp and so affect elimination of digoxin in urine. This effect on t1/2 remains 
unexplained and in a small DDI study it may not represent a true difference. 
Overall, existing knowledge regarding COBI and its effects on transporters, as well as the substrate profile of 
TFV, do not explain the modest difference in TFV plasma levels observed when TAF was given with and 
without COBI to healthy subjects. There is no clear basis for concluding that the difference truly reflects 
different whole body distribution of TFV when TAF is administered with or without COBI. 
TFV is not the active moiety but is the moiety associated with adverse renal and bone effects. Since TFV 
plasma levels were slightly lower for F/TAF 25 mg vs. TAF 10 mg given with COBI there is no reason to 
expect a worse safety profile for F/TAF when used without COBI compared to Genvoya. In addition, the 
safety data from GS-US-311-1089, in which subjects either switched to TAF or remained on TDF, each with 
FTC and a wide range of third agents (including PI/r combinations), indicated that the safety profile for TAF-
treated patients vs. TDF-treated patients was consistent with observations made in the Phase 3 Genvoya 
studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild. 
The issue was whether the supposed difference in whole body distribution of TFV in the presence and absence 
of COBI could bring into question the validity of bridging F/R/TAF to the Genvoya Phase 3 efficacy data by 
means of TAF bioequivalence. Thus, to consider whether the durable anti-viral activity observed so far in 
plasma when dosing TAF as part of Genvoya, accompanied by lack of any signal for neurocognitive disorders 
caused by HIV-1 in the CNS, would apply when dosing TAF within other ART regimens, including F/R/TAF.  
As part of this concern regarding bridging of efficacy, it was questioned whether CNS penetration of TAF and 
formation of the active moiety TFV-DP in brain parenchyma could be different in the presence vs. absence of 
COBI. In addition, it was questioned whether control of HIV-1 within the CNS could vary depending on the 
third agent used with F/TAF. On this latter theme, and in relation to the well-recognised concerns regarding 
the efficacy of RPV 25 mg QD, it was questioned whether patients taking this FDC could be at particular risk 
of HIV-related neurocognitive disorders. Thus, several issues culminated in a series of questions that covered 
both the efficacy of F/TAF when used with third agents other than EVG/co, including but not limited to RPV, 
and the associated potential for HIV-1 neurocognitive disorders to occur. 
With regard to the brain levels of the active moiety (TFV-DP) when TAF is given orally, the theoretical 
concern is that systemic levels of inhibitors of transporters known to be located at the BBB (including P-gp, 
BCRP and MRP-4) could suffice to have a clinically important impact. Hence, if COBI or RTV were to exert 
some inhibition of these transporters at the BBB, the efflux of their substrates from the brain might be 
reduced. TAF is a substrate of P-gp and BRCP but TFV is not a substrate of either of these transporters. 
Theoretically brain parenchyma concentrations of TAF and TFV-DP could be relatively higher when TAF is 
dosed with vs. without COBI or RTV.  
TFV and TAF poorly penetrate into the CSF, likely resulting in concentrations well below EC50 for HIV reverse 
transcriptase. However, as reported by Kalvass et al. (2013) in a review conducted by the ITC, transport 
processes at the blood-CSF barrier can be functionally different than those at the BBB. For example, P-gp and 
BCRP secrete substrates into the CSF at the blood–CSF barrier, but at the BBB they act as efflux transporters 
pumping substrates into blood. In contrast, MRP4 acts as an efflux transporter at both the BBB and the 
blood–CSF barrier. The authors point out that effects on the activity of BCRP or MRP4 at the BBB are not 
likely to result in clinically relevant effects. As elaborated by the authors, drug detection and drug

concentrations in CSF may not provide an accurate reflection of concentrations in brain parenchyma. CSF 
concentrations are often not representative of unbound brain concentrations for substrates of P-gp, BCRP 
and/or MRP4. Furthermore, TFV-DP is the active moiety but it is formed only within cells. Hence it cannot be 
assumed that TAF and TFV levels measured in CSF necessarily correlate with inhibition of HIV-1 replication by 
TFV-DP within the brain. 
Kalvass et al. (2013) also discuss uptake transporters at the BBB. In light of the possibility that COBI could 
have effects on other (as yet untested or unrecognised transporters) this potential effect of COBI cannot be 
ruled out but it would only be important whenever TAF was a sensitive substrate. 
In the switch study GS-US-311-1089 there were no differences in efficacy or safety of F/TAF when used with 
a boosted PI or unboosted third agents, including no signal for neurocognitive disorders. However, the 
demonstration of efficacy in a population in which HIV-1 replication is already profoundly suppressed may not 
be relevant to initiation of treatment in the ART-naïve. In addition, only 3 patients received F/TAF+RPV in 
this switch study.  
During the review of F/R/TAF the applicant provided interim and blinded data on virologic failures in two 
ongoing studies in which patients who are virologically suppressed on Atripla or Eviplera are randomised to 
switch or not switch to F/R/TAF (GS-US-366-1160 and GS-US-366-1216). So far there have been very few 
virologic rebounds but, as for GS-US-311-1089, these interim switch study efficacy data cannot per se 
overcome the theoretical concerns that have been raised. 
HIV-1 replication in the CNS is thought to occur in perivascular macrophages and/or microglia within the 
brain parenchyma. In patients with cognitive impairment, HIV-1 RNA in the CSF is derived primarily from 
enriched perivascular macrophages and migrating monocytes. Although plasma TFV exposures with TAF are 
~90% lower vs. TDF, intracellular TFV-DP levels are typically 4- to 7-fold higher. Theoretically it may be that 
TAF is able to load migrating monocytes more effectively than TDF prior to entry into the CNS. 
Neuro-symptomatic replication of HIV-1 in the CNS (in which CSF HIV-1 RNA is higher than in plasma) does 
occur but appears to be rare and is mostly documented anecdotally via case reports or series. In reported 
cases of concurrent virologic failure in the CSF and plasma it is not possible to determine whether plasma 
virologic failure followed CSF virologic failure or vice versa. Generally the evidence supports a conclusion that 
clinically significant escape replication of HIV-1 in the CNS is extremely unlikely to occur when there is 
successful suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA regardless of the regimen used and the predicted CNS 
penetration of the active moieties. In addition, there is only a very remote possibility that escape replication 
in the CNS would lead to failure to control plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. 
In summary, although there remains a theoretical possibility that the presence of a P-gp inhibitor as part of 
an overall TAF-containing ART regimen could affect entry of TAF into the brain and, thus, TFV-DP levels, the 
overall picture at present suggests that this is a remote possibility. CSF levels of TFV or TAF cannot be 
regarded as highly predictive of TFV-DP in the brain. Brain penetration in nonclinical studies may poorly 
predict the human situation. There is at least a theoretical possibility that use of TAF rather than TDF could 
improve on levels of TFV-DP achieved in the CNS replicating sites.   
The general experience with the more highly effective ART regimens that have become available especially in 
the last decade support a conclusion that effective and sustained virologic suppression in plasma is 
associated with CSF virologic suppression or, at least, only asymptomatic and usually temporary detection of 
HIV-1 RNA in CSF. There no reason to believe that rates of plasma virologic failure or CSF virologic failure are 
more likely to occur with regimens containing TAF vs. otherwise identical regimens containing TDF. Thus, 
F/R/TAF should exert similar activity to Eviplera when used in accordance with identical restrictions and

warnings and there is no good reason to expect that the risk of escape HIV-1 replication in the brain is any 
greater with the former vs. the latter. 
The SAG concurred with a conclusion that F/TAF should pose no difference vs. Truvada in control over HIV 
replication in plasma and in the CNS when each is given with the same third agent, including RPV.  
Co-administration of TAF with inhibitors and inducers of P-gp 
There is incomplete overlap between inhibitors and inducers of each of CYP3A and P-gp and the magnitude of 
effect of any one agent can vary according to the co-administered substrate.  
The results of the DDI study with F/TAF and carbamazepine reported during the procedure shows that the 
effect of P-gp inducers on TAF is an important issue to be mentioned. In line with the Edurant SmPC, F/R/TAF 
is contraindicated for use with several agents that are known to induce CYP3A due to potential lack of efficacy 
resulting from lower RPV levels. These agents are also to some extent inducers of P-gp, although this is not 
specified in section 4.3. However, section 4.5 acknowledges that medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp 
activity may lead to changes in TAF absorption, including a lowering of TAF by P-gp inducers. Therefore the 
issue seems to be adequately covered in the SmPC. 
It was clear from GS-US-292-0101 that even after co-administration of 25 mg TAF with a strong P-gp 
inhibitor (COBI) the plasma TFV levels were markedly below those attained after dosing with TDF.  
Due to the overlap (although incomplete) between P-gp and CYP3A inhibitors it should be noted that the 
Edurant SmPC acknowledges that CYP3A inhibitors may increase RPV plasma levels but no dose adjustment 
is required. Therefore it seems that the RPV plasma levels reached were not anticipated to be associated with 
important safety issues. On the other hand, using F/TAF 25 mg in the presence of well-recognised potent 
inhibitors of P-gp could lead to chronic exposure to plasma TFV that is well above that observed in the 
E/C/F/TAF and other studies that support beneficial safety effects (including the switch study GS-US-311-
1089). It is not known whether longer-term exposure to plasma TFV levels well below those seen with TDF 
yet above those observed in the Phase 3 studies that provide the critical safety data for TAF vs. TDF could 
translate into a safety profile that more resembles TDF than TAF.  
For F/TAF there is the option of using 10 mg TAF when it is given with potent P-gp inhibitors. In the D180 
responses on F/TAF the applicant agreed that F/TAF 10 mg should be the dose used when the FDC is given 
with ciclosporin, ketoconazole and itraconazole. Since dose adjustment is not possible using F/R/TAF the only 
option seems to be to state that use with agents such as the triazoles and ciclosporin should be “not 
recommended” in the table in section 4.5.  
Other DDI issues 
F/R/TAF represents a single treatment regimen for HIV and therefore co-administration with other ART 
should not occur. This is stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Other issues for TAF pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has not been able to identify the mechanism of uptake of TAF into PBMCs. If there were to be 
any reason why TAF uptake into PBMCs was reduced to a level below that achieved with TDF 300 mg there 
would have to be a concern for efficacy. During the assessment of E/C/F/TAF and F/TAF the applicant 
provided additional argumentation supporting a conclusion that TAF uptake into cells is not associated with a 
specific transporter. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 87/120 
  
  
The applicant has concluded that TAF is primarily hydrolysed by CatA in PBMCs. Cathepsin A is a ubiquitously 
expressed multifunctional enzyme with deamidase, esterase and carboxypeptidase activities and is encoded 
by the CTSA gene. Genetic polymorphisms in CatA have been described, some of which can result in 
depressed enzymic activity. The potential for human polymorphisms in CatA to affect conversion of TAF to 
TFV was addressed during the procedure and seems to be remote. In-vitro studies did not suggest significant 
inhibition of the conversion step by HIV protease inhibitors (known to inhibit CatA) but during review of the 
E/C/F/TAF dossier the applicant acknowledged that the HCV PIs telaprevir and boceprevir could have an 
effect intracellularly and the SmPC was amended such that co-administration with these agents is not 
recommended. The same advice has been included in the F/R/TAF SmPC. The applicant commits to review 
newly marketed HIV or HCV PIs for any possibility that they could exert a similar effect on TAF conversion. 
After TAF is converted to TFV it is proposed that metabolism proceeds via the purine catabolic pathway. This 
includes formation of uric acid. In the metabolite profiling study with TAF uric acid levels in pooled plasma 
increased over time and reached a maximum at 72 h. TAF was undetectable by the 6-h time point, indicating 
that the depurination reaction proceeded even after TAF was depleted from plasma. The applicant considered 
that in theory complete inhibition of the depurination pathway could result in increase of plasma TFV levels 
up to 4-fold. Even under these conditions, the plasma TFV levels would be lower than those after 
administration of TDF (300 mg). Since the depurination reaction is likely to occur after TAF is converted to 
TFV, potential induction of this pathway should not affect the TAF levels and, therefore, not affect efficacy 
which is mainly delivered by intact TAF. On this basis the applicant concluded that clinically important DDIs 
associated with the depurination pathway are unlikely. 
TAF is slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro, which is inhibited by COBI. However, given the rapid rate of 
hydrolysis of TAF to form TFV it is thought to be unlikely that CYP3A4 plays a significant role in the activation 
of TAF.  
Special populations 
The SmPC recommends no dose adjustment in adult patients with estimated creatinine clearance 
≥ 30 mL/min or with Class A or B hepatic impairment. Treatment should not be initiated if CrCL is < 30 
mL/min and is not recommended in patients with Class C severe hepatic impairment due to lack of data. The 
Emtriva (FTC) SmPC requires lengthening of the dose interval when CrCL falls below 50 mL/min, which 
cannot be achieved using the F/R/TAF FDC. However, based on GS-US-292-0112, it was agreed that the data 
support use of FTC in patients with mild or moderate impairment of renal function without dose adjustment. 
Since this advice does not conflict with the RPV recommendations, the advice in the SmPC for F/R/TAF is 
acceptable regarding use in renal and hepatic impairment categories. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
TAF was selected for development specifically because it had potential to be active with much lower TFV 
plasma levels and hence improved safety vs. TDF. Thus, selection of the TAF dose could not be based on 
matching plasma profiles of TFV achieved with TAF vs. those observed with TDF. The TAF dose in F/R/TAF 
provides plasma TAF levels comparable with those obtained when 10 mg TAF is given with a strong P-gp 
inhibitor as part of E/C/F/TAF. F/R/TAF provides plasma levels of RPV bioequivalent to those achieved on 
dosing RPV alone under similar dosing conditions (i.e. after a standard moderate fat meal).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
There  were  no  dose-finding  studies  with  F/TAF  or  F/R/TAF  since  the  dose  of  TAF  was  identified  from  the 
monotherapy studies and modelling.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The  anticipated  efficacy  of  F/RTAF  is  primarily  based  on  PK  bridging  to  the  E/C/F/TAF  and  RPV  Phase  3 
studies in ART-naïve patients as described in the table below. The two Eviplera switch studies may be viewed 
as  supportive.  Data  from  the  two  adolescent  studies  (GS-US-292-0106  and  C213)  are  notable  because  the 
F/R/TAF FDC is proposed for use from 12 years of age.  
Data  up  to  Week  48  were  provided  from  the  F/TAF  switch  study  GS-US-311-1089  but  very  few  patients 
received  RPV  as  the  third  agent  so  they  are  of  limited  relevance.  During  the  procedure  blinded  virologic 
failure rates were provided from two ongoing studies in which virologically suppressed patients remained on 
Atripla  or  Eviplera  or  switched  to  F/R/TAF.  These  switch  studies  are  not  in  the  overview  of  clinical  studies 
table.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB in HIV-infected, ART naive adults 
based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. The details of the assay(s) used to measure HIV RNA are 
not reported but virological responses are reported at the < 50 and < 20 copies/mL level.  
A sample size of 840 patients randomised 1:1 (420 per group) was planned to achieve at least 95% power to 
assess a non-inferiority margin of 12% applied to the difference in Week 48 response rate (HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL as defined by the FDA snapshot algorithm) between 2 groups. It was assumed that each treatment 
would elicit a response rate of 0.85. The significance level was 1-sided alpha of 0.025. 
Two interim IDMC analyses were conducted prior to the primary analysis. An alpha penalty of 0.00001 was 
applied for each interim analysis so the primary efficacy hypothesis of non-inferiority of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB 
was tested with a 1-sided, 0.02499 alpha level. The Week 48 primary efficacy analysis used the FAS. The 
baseline stratum weighted difference in the response rate and its 95.002% CI were calculated based on 
stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportion. 
Based on planned Week 48 interim analyses conducted after all randomised patients had completed the Week 
48 study visit or had prematurely discontinued. It was planned that data would be combined across studies 
to assess efficacy, including an assessment of superiority of E/C/F/TAF over STB. After Week 96, patients will 
continue to take their blinded study drugs and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are 
unblinded, at which point all patients will return for an unblinding visit and will be given the option to 
participate in an open-label (OL) rollover study to receive E/C/F/TAF.

Study Title: A Phase 3 Open-label Safety Study of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
Alafenamide Single-Tablet Regimen in HIV-1 Positive Patients with Mild to Moderate Renal Impairment 
This open-label study was primarily designed to assess the safety profile of E/C/F/TAF in HIV-infected 
patients with stable renal impairment (eGFRCG 30-69 mL/min) at Week 24. Enrolment was in 2 cohorts: 
o  Cohort 1: switched to E/C/F/TAF from an existing ARV regimen on which they had HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL for at least 6 months or they had successfully completed GS-US-236-0118. 
o  Cohort 2: ARV-naïve with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL 
All subjects received E/C/F/TAF once daily with food. Selection criteria were similar to those for Phase 3. 
In Cohort 1 the majority was male (79.3%) with median age 58 years (63 were ≥ 65 years). Most (65.3%) 
were taking TDF-containing regimens prior to the switch. The baseline median CD4 count and CD4% were 
632 cells/µL and 34.7%, respectively. Overall, 97.5% had baseline HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and 2.5% had 
≥ 50 to ≤ 100,000 copies/mL. The majority acquired HIV via homosexual sex (52.1%), 74.4% were 
asymptomatic and 14.0% had AIDS. Overall, 33.1% had eGFRCG < 50 mL/min, 63.6% had eGFRCG 30-59 
mL/min, 42.3% had clinically significant proteinuria (UPCR > 200 mg/g) and 48.9% had clinically significant 
albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g). Dipsticks showed that 9.5% had Grade 2, 23.1% had Grade 1 and 67.4% 
had no proteinuria. In Cohort 2 only 6 patients were enrolled. 
Following the completion of all patients to Week 48 there were no clinically relevant differences in virologic 
success rates between subgroups (age, sex, race, region, or study drug adherence rate) for Cohort 1. The 
virologic success rate for those aged ≥ 65 years was 85.7% (54/63). The percentages with < 20 copies/mL 
at Week 48 using the FAS were 90.1% for Cohort 1 (baseline eGFRCG < 50 mL/min 88.8%; baseline eGFRCG 
≥ 50 mL/min 90.7%) and 6/6 in Cohort 2. In Cohort 1, 2 patients (0.8%) had virus that showed resistance 
to multiple drug classes. One had the same resistance documented in an historic genotype and the other 
appeared to have had reinfection with a resistant virus.

administered as 25 mg once daily compared with control (EFV 600 mg once daily) in regard to the proportion 
of virologic responders (plasma viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, according to the TLOVR algorithm) at 
48 weeks in ARV treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, with a maximum allowable difference of 
12%. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion 
Adult subjects with a viral load ≥ 5000 copies/mL, who were ARV treatment-naive, who had HIV-1 
susceptible to the FTC/RTF at screening, and in whom the genotype of HIV-1 exhibited no NNRTI RAMs at 
screening were eligible for the trial.

Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) Single Tablet Regimen (STR) in HIV-
1 Infected Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adolescents 
This open-label study was conducted in ARV-naïve HIV-infected adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 years) with 
body weight  ≥ 35 kg, plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL, CD4 cell counts > 100 cells/μL and eGFR ≥ 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (Schwartz formula) at screening. Viruses were to be sensitive to TFV, EVG and FTC based 
on genotyping at screening. All patients received E/C/F/TAF QD with food.  
In Part A: 18 to 24 patients (at least 6 aged 12 to < 15 years and 6 aged 15 to < 18 years) were to be 
enrolled to evaluate steady-state intensive PK at Week 4 (see Pharmacokinetics). 
In Part B: The remaining patients (up to the planned total of 50 across Parts A and B) were enrolled to 
evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of E/C/F/TAF. 
The completed Week 24 analyses showed that 90% (45/50) had < 50 copies/mL. There was no virologic 
resistance to E/C/F/TAF detected.  
The mean (SD) increase from baseline in CD4 cell count at Week 24 was 191 (175.2) cells/µL

Ongoing Studies with F/R/TAF 
Two Phase 3b studies (GS-US-366-1160 and GS-US-366-1216) are currently ongoing with the F/R/TAF FDC 
and  will  provide  post-approval  data  on  use  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  who  are  virologically  suppressed  on 
their current regimen. 
GS-US-366-1160 is a randomised (1:1), double-blind Phase 3b study in which virologically-suppressed 
patients do or do not switch from Atripla (EFV/FTC/TDF) to F/R/TAF. The primary analysis will consist of a 
non-inferiority evaluation of switching to F/R/TAF vs. continuing on Atripla based on proportions with HIV-1 
RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 (as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis). Interim unaudited data reported 
that the study was fully enrolled with 875 patients and the median study drug duration as of 14 December 
2015 was 12.3 weeks. Virologic success (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, missing treated as failure) at Week 12 
per blinded preliminary data of both treatment groups combined was 97% (855/874) and there were no 
discontinuations due to lack of efficacy. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
occurred in 11 patients (1.3%), none of whom had evidence of virologic failure at the time of discontinuation. 
GS-US-366-1216 is a randomised (1:1), double-blind Phase 3b study in which virologically-suppressed 
patients do or do not switch from Eviplera to F/R/TAF. The primary analysis will consist of a non-inferiority 
evaluation of switching to F/R/TAF vs. continuing on Eviplera based on proportions with HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL at Week 48 (as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis). Based on interim unaudited data the study 
was fully enrolled with 630 patients and the median study drug duration as of 14 December 2015 was 14.7 
weeks. Virologic success (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, missing treated as failure) at Week 12 per blinded 
preliminary data of both treatment groups combined was 98.3% (619/630) and there were no 
discontinuations due to lack of efficacy. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
occurred in 2 patients (0.3%), neither of whom had evidence of virologic failure at the time of 
discontinuation.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose of TAF within F/R/TAF 
The  Phase  2  and  3  E/C/F/TAF  studies  vs.  STB  evaluated  the  use  of  TAF  with  other  highly  active  agents  to 
which  patients’  viruses  were  known  to  be  susceptible.  The  design  of  these  studies,  while  appropriate  for 
patient  care,  cannot  provide  definitive  evidence  that  the  TAF  dose  within  these  highly  active  regimens  was 
necessarily  sufficient.  The  critical  data  to  support  the  dose  in  the  FDC  come  from  the  monotherapy  studies 
(with  doses  ranging  from  8  to  150  mg),  the  Emax  modelling  and  the  PK  data.  Taking  into  account  the 
apparent lack of any negative interaction between TAF and RPV, the use of 25 mg TAF when combined with 
FTC  and  RPV  can  be  supported.  The  discussion  of  pharmacokinetics  further  considers  the  basis  for  bridging 
efficacy from Genvoya and Edurant studies to F/R/TAF. 
Indicated population for F/R/TAF  
Phase 2 results suggested that STB might be better than  E/C/F/TAF in those with the highest baseline viral 
loads (but only 20% had >100,000 c/mL) and lowest CD4 counts (but < 5% had < 200 cells/µL). One Phase 
3 study (0104) essentially showed no difference between treatments in these subgroups. In the other study 
(0111)  the  differences  in  percentages  (E/C/F/TAF  vs  STB)  were  -3.1%  (95%  CI:  -12.8%  to  6.5%)  for 
baseline HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/mL and -6.4% (95% CI: -20.8% to 8.0%) for baseline CD4 cell count 
<  200  cells/μL.  After  further  exploration  of  the  data  pooled  across  Phase  2  and  3  studies  the  applicant 
concluded that the apparent differences between treatments for the subgroups were driven by non-virologic 
reasons  for  non-success  (e.g.  missing  data  or  study  drug  discontinuation  due  to  AEs,  deaths  or  other 
reasons). These arguments were accepted for Genvoya.  
Moreover,  updated  week  96  efficacy  results  were  provided  for  these  studies  (0104  and  0111)  and  are 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Nevertheless, it is appropriate that the proposed indication for use of F/R/TAF is restricted to patients with ≤ 
100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL due to the conclusions drawn from the RPV Phase 3 studies. In addition, the 
SmPC conveys the major findings from the RPV studies, including the high rate of emergent RAMs in viruses 
from treatment failures. 
Use of F/R/TAF in adolescents 
The  E/C/F/TAF  study,  included  the  updated  results,  was  assessed  as  part  of  the  application  dossier  for 
Genvoya.  The  viral  response  rate  in  the  48  adolescents  studied  was  high  and  similar  to  that  in  adults. 
Emergence of viral resistance was not observed.  
In contrast, the viral response rates at Week 24 and 48 (75% and 72%) in the 36 adolescents enrolled into 
the RPV study C213 were, if anything, slightly lower than observed in the adult Phase 3 studies. In common 
with  the  adult  studies  there  was  lower  efficacy  as  viral  load  increased  and  6/8  failures  at  Week  48  had 
evidence  of  emergence  of  NNRTI  resistance  mutations.  There  were  no  further  virologic  failures  between 
weeks 48 and 96. At Week 48 72.2% (26/36) were virologic responders. These results are described under 
the  heading  Paediatric  population  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  The  warning  statement  agreed  as  a  result  of 
the variation to add use in adolescents to the Edurant SmPC has been carried over into the F/R/TAF SmPC. 
Lack of efficacy data with F/R/TAF 
Unfortunately the applicant’s two ongoing studies with F/R/TAF are both switch studies (one from Atripla and 
one from Eviplera), so that the question of primary efficacy will not be addressed. Nevertheless, supportive 
Assessment report

efficacy data and very useful safety data will come from these two studies. Thus far the blinded data suggest 
very high rates of maintenance of viral suppression. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
F/R/TAF provides plasma levels of RPV bioequivalent to those achieved on dosing RPV alone under similar 
dosing conditions (i.e. after a standard moderate fat meal). Therefore the contribution of RPV to the efficacy 
of F/R/TAF could be presumed to be similar to that exerted when it is combined with FTC/TDF, including 
administration as the FDC Eviplera. In Phase 3 studies with RPV in combination with FTC/TDF or with other 
NRTIs, the viral suppression rates have been lower than observed with E/C/F/TAF, especially in the subset 
with the highest baseline viral loads, with emergence of NNRTI RAMs in a substantial proportion of virological 
failures. However, the F/R/TAF SmPC recommends dosing with food and restricts use to patients with viral 
loads < 100,000 c/mL.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of the FTC/RPV/TAF (200/25/25 mg) FDC is based on the established safety of E/C/F/TAF 
(150/150/200/10 mg), Edurant (RPV 25 mg), and Complera/Eviplera (FTC/RPV/TDF 200/25/300 mg) using a 
pharmacokinetic bioequivalence bridge between FTC/RPV/TAF and E/C/F/TAF (for the FTC/TAF component) 
and between FTC/RPV/TAF and Edurant (for the RPV component). The safety of E/C/F/TAF, Edurant, and 
Complera/Eviplera has been established in the following HIV-infected patient populations: 
•  Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive subjects: E/C/F/TAF pivotal Phase 3 Studies GS-US-292-0104 and 
GS-US-292-0111 and the randomized phase of Phase 2 Study GS-US-292-0102; RPV pivotal Phase 3 
Studies C209 and C215 
•  Virologically suppressed subjects: E/C/F/TAF Phase 3 Study GS-US-292-0109 and the open-label 
extension phase of Phase 2 Study GS-US-292-0102; Complera/Eviplera Phase 2b Study GS-US-264-
0111 and Phase 3b Study GS-US-264-0106 
•  Subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment: E/C/F/TAF Phase 3 Study GS-US-292-0112 
•  ART-naive adolescent subjects: E/C/F/TAF Phase 2/3 Study GS-US-292-0106; RPV Phase 2 Study 
C213 
The applicant provided a summary of safety containing all the information related to E/C/F/TAF, F/TAF, RPV 
and FTC/RPV/TDF.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC is based on the two E/C/F/TAF studies vs. STB in the ART-naïve and the two pivotal 
RPV  studies  in  the  ART-naïve  plus  post-marketing  experience  from  Eviplera.  The  table  in  section  4.8  of  the 
SmpC  attempts  to  differentiate  whether  the  table  entries  arise  from  the  E/C/F/TAF  or  RPV  studies  or  the 
post-marketing experience. 
Patient exposure 
The assessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which 
2,396 patients received emtricitabine+tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir+cobicistat as a 
fixed-dose combination tablet, pooled data from 686 patients in the controlled studies TMC278-C209 and 
TMC278-C215 in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, who received rilpivirine 25 mg once

daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, and on post-marketing experience with 
emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  
In Phase 1 studies, a total of 197 healthy subjects received at least 1 dose of the FTC/RPV/TAF FDC.

There are no unblinded safety data in HIV-infected patients using F/R/TAF.  
New safety data using F/R/TAF in healthy subjects 
The three new Phase 1 studies provide the only safety data but these are of very limited relevance to the 
intended clinical use.

AEs  were  reported  in  6  subjects  (6.3%)  following  FTC/RPV/TAF,  10  (10.5%)  following  RPV  and  8  (8.3%) 
following E/C/F/TAF. The  most frequently reported AEs were constipation (9 [9.4%]), nausea and headache 
(6 [6.3%] each). Constipation was reported for 2 (2.1%) following FTC/RPV/TAF, 6 (6.3%) following RPV and

2 (2.1%) following E/C/F/TAF. Nausea was reported in one, one and 4 after each treatment while headache 
was  reported  for  3,  1  and  2  per  treatment.  AEs  considered  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator  were 
reported in none, one and four subjects after respective treatments. 
GS-US-366-1651  
AEs  were  reported  in  8/60  (13.3%)  after  dosing  under  fasted  conditions,  1/30  (3.3%)  after  dosing  with 
moderate-fat  food  and  4/30  subjects  (13.3%)  following  dosing  with  high-calorie,  high-fat  food.  No  AE  was 
reported  in  >  1  subject.  One  subject  had  AEs  that  were  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  study 
drug, which included Grade 1 AEs of nausea, vomiting and dizziness that occurred after dosing on the day of 
administration of FTC/RPV/TAF under fed conditions (high-calorie, high-fat food). All these events resolved on 
the same day without treatment. 
GS-US-366-1689  
AEs  were  reported  in  15  subjects  (35.7%),  including  7  (16.7%)  following  LDV/SOF,  6  (14.3%)  following 
F/R/TAF and 8 (19.0%) following combined treatment. AEs reported in 2 or more subjects were: 
• 
• 
• 
LDV/SOF: nausea (4.8%, 2 subjects) and vomiting (4.8%, 2 subjects) 
FTC/RPV/TAF: constipation (9.5%, 4 subjects) 
LDV/SOF+FTC/RPV/TAF: constipation (4.8%, 2 subjects) and headache (4.8%, 2 subjects).  
All AEs were Grade 1 or 2. Five subjects (11.9%) had AEs that were considered treatment related but none 
occurred  with  F/R/TAF  alone  (2  with  LDV/SOF  and  3  with  combined  treatment).  One  subject  completed  11 
days F/R/TAF and then started combined treatment. On Day 12 (Day 1 of LDV/SOF+F/R/TAF) she had Grade 
2 non-serious colitis and eventually discontinued on Day 28. The AE of colitis was considered related to study 
drug by the investigator.  
There have been no deaths or SAEs in the three Phase 1 studies. 
In  GS-US-366-1689  with  11-day  treatment  periods  laboratory  abnormalities  were  reported  for  17  subjects 
(40.5%) following LDV/SOF, 20 (47.6%) following F/R/TAF and 20 (47.6%) following combination treatment. 
The most common laboratory abnormalities are shown in the table below.  
Three  subjects  had  Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities.  Grade  3  laboratory  abnormalities  included 
increased LDL (observed with each treatment; see above), positive occult blood in urine (following F/R/TAF; 
single  occasion  and  probably  menstrual)  and  increased  AST  (following  F/R/TAF).  One  Grade  4  laboratory 
abnormality of increased creatine kinase following F/R/TAF was reported. This subject had a baseline AST of 
23  U/L  that  increased  on  Day  26  to  217  U/L  (Grade  3).  Creatine  kinase  was  also  assessed  for  this  subject 
only  and  found  to  be  9081  U/L  (Grade  4).  No  corresponding  AEs  were  reported,  as  the  elevations  were 
consistent with physical exercise.  Both laboratory values returned to within the reference range by the end 
of study (Day 34). 
Laboratory findings 
Renal laboratory parameters for emtricitabine+tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimens 
In GS-US-299-0102 increases from baseline in mean values for serum creatinine occurred in both groups but 
were smaller at weeks 24 and 48 in the D/C/F/TAF group. Note that the actual changes were small in both

groups (e.g. increases from baseline at Week 48 were D/C/F/TAF 0.06 mg/dL vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 0.09 
mg/dL [p = 0.053]). 
Decreases from baseline in median eGFRCG occurred in both groups but were smaller in the D/C/F/TAF 
group. For example, at Week 48 the median changes from baseline were D/C/F/TAF -2.9 mL/min vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD -10.6 mL/min (p = 0.017). The changes from baseline in eGFRCKD-EPI, creatinine and 
eGFRCKD-EPI, cysC all followed the observations for eGFRCG. 
Figure 5.  GS-US-299-0102: Median (Q1, Q3) of Change from Baseline in Estimated GFR by Cockcroft-Gault 
(mL/min) by Visit (Safety Analysis Set) 
Proteinuria was reported for 32.4% in the D/C/F/TAF group and 34.0% in the DRV+COBI+TVD group.  Most 
proteinuria by dipstick was Grade 1 or 2; one in the DRV+COBI+TVD group had Grade 3. There were 
numerical but not statistically significant differences between treatment groups in median percentage change 
from baseline in UPCR or UACR (UPCR: D/C/F/TAF -8.22% vs. DRV+COBI+TVD -27.52%; UACR -13.1% vs. -
22.6%). 
The median percent increase from baseline at Week 48 in RBP to creatinine ratio was D/C/F/TAF 9% vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD 54% (p = 0.003) whereas the median percent change from baseline at Week 48 in beta-2-
microglobulin to creatinine ratio was -42.0% vs. 2.3% (p = 0.002), respectively. 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median values for the other renal biomarkers in 
either group (FEPO4 and FEUA using serum creatinine adjusted or unadjusted values) and no statistically 
significant differences between groups.

Renal laboratory parameters for rilpivirine-containing regimens 
The pooled data from the Phase 3 TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215 studies of treatment-naïve patients 
demonstrate that serum creatinine increased and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased over 
96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine. Over 96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine mean changes of 
0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 mg/dL to 0.6 mg/dL) for creatinine and -13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range: 
-63.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 40.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) for eGFR were observed.  
Lipid laboratory parameters for emtricitabine+tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimens 
In studies in treatment-naïve patients, increases from baseline were observed in both treatment groups for 
the fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 96.  The median increase from baseline for these 
parameters was greater in patients receiving emtricitabine+tenofovir alafenamide compared with patients 
receiving emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both given with elvitegravir+cobicistat as a fixed-dose 
combination tablet (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct 
LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides).  Median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 96 in total 
cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio was 0.1 (-0.3, 0.7) in patients receiving emtricitabine+tenofovir 
alafenamide and 0.0 (-0.4, 0.5) in patients receiving emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (p < 0.001 
for the difference between treatment groups). 
Lipid laboratory parameters for rilpivirine-containing regimens 
At 96 weeks in the pooled Phase 3 C209 and C215 studies of treatment-naïve patients, in the 
rilpivirine+emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate arm the mean change from baseline in total cholesterol 
(fasted) was 2 mg/dL, in HDL-cholesterol (fasted) 4 mg/dL, in LDL-cholesterol (fasted) -1 mg/dL, and in 
triglycerides (fasted) -14 mg/dL.  In the efavirenz+emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate arm the mean 
change from baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) was 26 mg/dL, in HDL-cholesterol (fasted) 11 mg/dL, in 
LDL-cholesterol (fasted) 14 mg/dL, and in triglycerides (fasted) 6 mg/dL.  
Cortisol 
In the pooled Phase 3 TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215 studies of treatment-naïve patients, at Week 96, 
there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -19.1 (-30.85; -7.37) nmol/L in the 
rilpivirine arm and of -0.6 (-13.29; 12.17) nmol/L in the efavirenz arm. At Week 96, the mean change from 
baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the rilpivirine arm (+18.4 ± 8.36 nmol/L) than in the 
efavirenz arm (+54.1 ± 7.24 nmol/L). Mean values for the rilpivirine arm for both basal and ACTH-stimulated 
cortisol at Week 96 were within the normal range. These changes in adrenal safety parameters were not 
clinically relevant.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Across all studies, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were uncommon, and the percentages were 
generally similar between treatment groups within each study.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
There  are  no  safety  data  in  patients  specific  to  F/R/TAF.  The  safety  data  from  the  ongoing  switch  studies 
(either from Atripla or from Eviplera) will be useful. Meanwhile the safety data from the three new studies in 
healthy subjects are of very limited relevance. Nevertheless they do not raise any new concerns.  
The data in adolescents were not generated with F/R/TAF but they do provide some support for use from the 
age  of  12  years  and  35  kg  body  weight.  There  were  no  important  differences  in  the  safety  profiles  in 
adolescents  compared  to  adults.  These  studies  are  described  under  the  heading  paediatric  population  in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Regarding the specific issue of bone effects for TAF in the adolescents, the overall mean and median changes 
from baseline in spine and TBLH BMD at Weeks 24 and 48 were positive in Study GS-US-292-0106. At Week 
24, 3/47 subjects (6.4%) had a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD but none had a ≥ 4% decrease in TBLH BMD. 
Also, 5/47 showed a worsening (change from > -2 to ≤ -2) from baseline in their spine or TBLH height-age 
BMD Z-scores at Weeks 24 and/or 48. However, the interplay between these and other factors is complex in 
a population that is mostly actively growing and it is not possible to identify any specific factors that definitely 
pre-disposed  these  patients  to  develop  decreases  in  BMD.  Moreover,  it  is  not  possible  to  discern  from  48 
weeks  uncontrolled  safety  data  whether  long  term  exposure  to  relatively  low  plasma  TFV  levels  could 
ultimately  lead  to  similar  effects  on  bone  as  observed  with  TDF.  This  possibility  has  been  raised  during 
assessment  of  the  prior  TAF  dossiers  and  is  reflected  in  the  RMPs.  More  data  from  GS-US-292-0106  will 
become available since there is an extension period. 
In the E/C/F/TAF Phase 2/3 studies there were direct comparisons of safety with STB in previously untreated 
patients  and  assessments  of  safety  after  switching  from  TDF  to  TAF  within  regimens.  The  AE  profile  of 
E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of STB. Overall the data suggested benefits in terms of renal and 
bone effects for TAF vs. TDF, which was apparent in prospective comparisons in ART-naïve patients as well as 
post-switching.  
Detailed  assessment  of  renal  function  in  patients  with  eGFRCG  30-69  mL/min  treated  with  E/C/F/TAF 
supports no adjustment of the FTC dose when CrCL is < 50 mL/min. Thus far there have not been any cases 
of  PRT  or  Fanconi’s  syndrome  with  TAF.  Use  of  RPV  is  not  restricted  by  renal  function  and  therefore  the 
proposal  to  use  F/R/TAF  from  CrCL  values  30  mL/min  upwards  is  acceptable  but  the  SmPC  also  notes  that 
RPV does have a modest effect on serum creatinine, resulting in decreased eGFR.  
Current data, including updates provided during the review of E/C/F/TAF, do not suggest that the nonclinical 
findings  translate  into  a  concern  regarding  the  ocular  safety  of  TAF.  There  was  one  adolescent  with  uveitis 
considered  to  be  drug-related  by  the  investigator.  At  present  it  seems  reasonable  to  keep  this  issue  under 
close review with appropriate reflection in the RMP. 
In  previously  ART-naïve  patients  E/C/F/TAF  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of  abnormal  fasting  lipids, 
including Grade 3 and 4 abnormalities, than STB. The differences between TAF and TDF-containing regimens 
are  thought  to  mainly  reflect  the  known  lipid-lowering  effect  of  TFV  and  the  loss  of  this  effect  due  to  the 
much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF vs. STB. Also, based on the finding that median 
changes  from  baseline  decreased  in  renally  impaired  patients  in  0112  who  switched  to  E/C/F/TAF  from  a 
non-TDF-containing regimen the applicant suggests that the effect on lipids was not due to TAF per se.  
Furthermore, the lipid changes after initiation of E/C/F/TAF are in line with those observed with several other 
ART  regimens  that  do  not  contain  TDF.  In  the  Phase  3  RPV  studies  in  the  ART-naïve  there  was  a  minimal 
change in fasting lipids vs. EFV-containing regimens with the same NRT backbones. On this basis the effects 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 109/120 
  
  
on  lipids  during  treatment  with  F/R/TAF  seems  unlikely  to  be  very  different  from  the  effects  observed  with 
E/C/F/TAF.  
There  was  no  excess  of  Grade  3  or  4  hyperuricaemia  with  E/C/F/TAF  in  the  ART-naïve  and  only  a  slightly 
higher rate of hyperuricaemia. Mean and median uric acid levels were effectively unchanged from baseline to 
Week  48  in  the  E/C/F/TAF  group  with  a  small  decrease  in  the  STB  group.  AEs  that  could  be  due  to 
hyperuricaemia  were  not  observed.  However,  the  applicant  should  address  the  potential  concern  regarding 
co-administration of any TAF-containing regimen with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. 
The safety profiles of RPV in Phase 3 studies and of Eviplera in the two switch studies have been extensively 
reviewed previously and have been taken into account in the SmPC for F/R/TAF.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The known safety profile has been reflected in the SmPC for F/R/TAF. Another beneficial effect is that the 
renal safety profile of TAF appears to be better than that of TDF in patients previously naïve to ART and in 
those who switched from TDF to TAF. There are also post-marketing data available for Eviplera that have 
been taken into account.

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Odefsey (emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir 
alafenamide) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 
January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
TAF was selected for development specifically because it had potential to be active with much lower TFV 
plasma levels and hence improved safety vs. TDF. Thus, selection of the TAF dose could not be based on 
matching plasma profiles of TFV achieved with TAF vs. those observed with TDF. The TAF dose in F/R/TAF 
provides plasma TAF levels comparable with those obtained when 10 mg TAF is given with a strong P-gp 
inhibitor as part of E/C/F/TAF. 
E/C/F/TAF, containing 10 mg TAF in the presence of a strong P-gp inhibitor (COBI), demonstrated a 
consistently high level of efficacy in previously ART-naïve patients in two Phase 3 studies. In the two Phase 3 
studies with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg vs. STB in ART-naïve patients fewer patients in the E/C/F/TAF group had a 
> 3% decrease from baseline in hip or spine BMD, noting nonetheless that such decreases did still occur in 
the 48 weeks after starting treatment with E/C/F/TAF. The FRAX analysis also suggested a benefit for 
E/C/F/TAF over STB as did bone biomarkers. On switching from TDF to TAF in another study with E/C/F/TAF 
10 mg it was also apparent that TAF had markedly less effects on BMD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 115/120 
  
  
Another beneficial effect is that the renal safety profile of TAF appears to be better than that of TDF in 
patients previously naïve to ART and in those who switched from TDF to TAF. Additionally, detailed 
assessments of renal function in the E/C/F/TAF study in patients with baseline eGFRCG in the range 30-69 
mL/min support a conclusion that F/TAF has an acceptable renal safety profile in patients in the 30-50 
mL/min range. The data also support use of FTC without dose adjustment in this group and RPV is approved 
for use in mild and moderate renal insufficiency. 
F/R/TAF provides plasma levels of RPV bioequivalent to those achieved on dosing RPV alone under similar 
dosing conditions (i.e. after a standard moderate fat meal). Therefore the contribution of RPV to the efficacy 
of F/R/TAF could be presumed to be similar to that exerted when it is combined with FTC/TDF, including 
administration as the FDC Eviplera. In Phase 3 studies with RPV in combination with FTC/TDF or with other 
NRTIs, the viral suppression rates have been lower than observed with E/C/F/TAF, especially in the subset 
with the highest baseline viral loads, with emergence of NNRTI RAMs in a substantial proportion of virological 
failures. However, the F/R/TAF SmPC recommends dosing with food and restricts use to patients with viral 
loads < 100,000 c/mL.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
GS-US-292-103 showed that although plasma TAF was very slightly lower on dosing with Genvoya compared 
with F/TAF 25 mg, the plasma TFV AUC was lower after dosing with F/TAF 25 mg vs. Genvoya. This finding, 
which remains mechanistically unexplained, suggested an effect of COBI on the compartmental disposition of 
TFV.  
• 
• 
The finding raised a question regarding the basis for extrapolation of efficacy from Genvoya to F/TAF 
regardless of the third agent co-administered and whether or not the regimen included P-gp inhibitors 
COBI or RTV.  
It also raised a question regarding the CNS levels of TFV-DP that may be achieved with F/TAF, and, 
hence, the efficacy of various TAF-containing regimens against HIV within the CNS.  
The applicant responded to these concerns during the procedure and the questions were referred to the 
Virology SAG. When considering these issues the following observations have some relevance. 
To ascribe the difference in TFV plasma levels that was observed when TAF was administered with or without 
COBI to a differential effect on the whole body distribution of TFV would require that systemic concentrations 
of COBI are sufficient to exert effects on relevant transporters outside of the gut.   
In vitro, COBI inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MRP-2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Its effect on 
plasma exposures to substrates of P-gp and/or BCRP via inhibition at the gut level is clear. However, in the 
context of explaining effects on plasma TFV levels after oral administration of TAF, it should be noted that 
TFV is not a substrate for P-gp, MRP2 or BCRP and its renal elimination should not be affected by COBI based 
on the calculated Cmax,u/IC50 ratios. Regarding the potential for systemic effects on other transporters it is 
clear that COBI reaches sufficient concentrations to inhibit MATE1 in the kidney, with consequent effects on 
serum creatinine. However, it is not expected to reach sufficient concentrations to inhibit P-gp at the BBB and 
inhibition of BCRP and MRP4 at the BBB does not seem to have marked effects on their substrates. Overall, 
existing knowledge regarding COBI and its effects on transporters, as well as the substrate profile of TFV, do 
not explain the modest difference in TFV plasma levels observed when TAF was given with and without COBI 
to healthy subjects. There is no clear basis for concluding that the difference truly reflects different whole

Page 116/120 
  
  
body distribution of TFV when TAF is administered with or without COBI or that dosing with and without COBI 
will affect brain parenchyma levels of the active moiety TFV-DP. 
TFV is not the active moiety but is the moiety associated with adverse renal and bone effects. Since TFV 
plasma levels were slightly lower for F/TAF 25 mg vs. TAF 10 mg given with COBI there is no reason to 
expect a worse safety profile for F/TAF when used without COBI compared to Genvoya. In addition, the 
safety data from GS-US-311-1089, in which subjects either switched to TAF or remained on TDF, each with 
FTC and a wide range of third agents (including PI/r combinations), indicated that the safety profile for TAF-
treated patients vs. TDF-treated patients was consistent with observations made in the Phase 3 Genvoya 
studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild. 
In summary, although there remains a theoretical possibility that the presence of a P-gp inhibitor as part of 
an overall TAF-containing ART regimen could affect entry of TAF into the brain and, thus, TFV-DP levels, the 
overall picture at present suggests that this is a remote possibility. CSF levels of TFV or TAF cannot be 
regarded as highly predictive of TFV-DP in the brain. Brain penetration in nonclinical studies may poorly 
predict the human situation. There is at least a theoretical possibility that use of TAF rather than TDF could 
improve on levels of TFV-DP achieved in the CNS replicating sites.   
The general experience with the more highly effective ART regimens that have become available especially in 
the last decade support a conclusion that effective and sustained virologic suppression in plasma is 
associated with CSF virologic suppression or, at least, only asymptomatic and usually temporary detection of 
HIV-1 RNA in CSF. There no reason to think that rates of plasma virologic failure or CSF virologic failure are 
more likely to occur with regimens containing TAF vs. otherwise identical regimens containing TDF. Thus, 
F/R/TAF should exert similar activity to Eviplera when used in accordance with identical restrictions and 
warnings and there is no good reason to expect that the risk of escape HIV-1 replication in the brain is any 
greater with the former vs. the latter. 
The SAG concurred with the conclusion that F/TAF should pose no difference vs. Truvada in control over HIV 
replication in plasma and in the CNS when each is given with the same third agent, including RPV.  
There are concerns regarding the adequacy of 25 mg TAF in the presence of a strong inducer of P-gp. Since 
co-administration of F/R/TAF is contraindicated with strong inducers of CYP3A because of the effect on RPV, 
and since inducers of CYP3A and P-gp overlap, use of F/R/TAF is effectively contraindicated with potent P-gp 
inducers. Use of F/R/TAF with strong inhibitors of P-gp is not recommended since no dose reduction is 
possible with this FDC. 
For E/C/F/TAF and for RPV there are currently few data available in adolescents. The available data for 
E/C/F/TAF suggest high efficacy in this age group. RPV appears slightly less effective in adolescents than 
adults and the same issues relating to baseline viral load and emergence of resistance apply as for adults. 
However, adherence to F/R/TAF when presented as a FDC may be better. The safety data with E/C/F/TAF 
thus far do suggest that TAF can be used in growing adolescents and that the restriction placed on use of TDF 
need not apply. However, longer exposures and larger numbers of treated patients are needed to confirm the 
current findings.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In comparative studies in ART-naïve patients the AE profile of E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of 
STB. E/C/F/TAF was associated with higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids, including Grade 3 and 4 
abnormalities, than TDF-containing comparative regimens. Similarly, higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids 
were observed in those who switched to E/C/F/TAF vs. those who maintained a TDF-containing regimen. The 
difference between TAF and TDF-containing regimens likely reflects the known lipid-lowering effect of TFV 
and the much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF. Nevertheless, the effect of TAF-containing 
regimens resembles that of other commonly used ART regimens without TDF and the benefits of TAF vs. TDF 
in terms of renal and bone effects appear to outweigh any concerns there may be regarding the lipid profile.  
The known safety profile has been reflected in the SmPC for F/R/TAF. There are also post-marketing data 
available for Eviplera that have been taken into account.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Thus far there have not been any cases of PRT or Fanconi’s syndrome in patients treated with TAF. More 
extensive and longer-term data are needed to confirm the observation. In addition, although data thus far 
support a conclusion that TAF is much less likely than TDF to exert negative effects on BMD or on renal 
function it remains to be seen whether very long term exposure to low TFV plasma levels could have an 
effect. This matter can really only be addressed in routine use.  
Taking into account the metabolic pathway, it was noted that Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricaemia occurred in 2 
E/C/F/TAF and no non-switch patients in GS-US-292-0109. Also, any grade hyperuricaemia occurred in 
13.2% vs. 5.0% although no AEs were related to abnormal uric acid. Thus far there does not appear to be a 
link between the hyperuricaemia and gout or other AEs that could be due to hyperuricaemia (including renal 
stones). However, this matter needs to be kept under review as a potential risk. The possible effect of co-
administering xanthine oxidase inhibitors on the final metabolic fate of TAF also needs to be addressed. 
Current data do not suggest that the nonclinical findings translate into a concern regarding the ocular safety 
of TAF. There was one adolescent with uveitis considered to be drug-related by the investigator. At present it 
seems reasonable to keep this issue under close review as reflected in the RMP. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
E/C/F/TAF  has  been  shown  to  achieve  high  virologic  suppression  rates  in  the  ART-naïve  and  to  support 
maintenance of suppression after switching from successful regimens. The safety profile for the most part is 
similar  or  improved  vs.  that  of  STB,  especially  notable  for  the  renal  and  bone  effects.  The  fact  that  lipid 
abnormalities are more likely to occur with TAF then TDF does not impact on the overall conclusions on safety 
provided  that  the  rates  observed  are  shown  to  be  in  line  with  those  that  occur  with  other  commonly  used 
regimens.  
Assessment report  
EMA/335723/2016 
Page 118/120 
  
  
RPV co-administered with FTC/TDF and taken with food exerts acceptable antiviral efficacy in patients with no 
known RAMs of relevance and with baseline viral loads < 100,000 c/mL. At a dose of 25 mg taken once daily 
with  food  RPV  has  been  shown  to  have  an  acceptable  safety  profile  when  administered  in  conjunction  with 
FTC/TDF. If anything, the safety profile for F/R/TAF can be expected to be more benign than that of Eviplera. 
While the application is based on bridging to the Genvoya and Edurant studies the potential issues regarding 
bridging were thoroughly explored during the procedure. In conclusion, there were no remaining major issues 
precluding acceptance of the bridging strategy of this application. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The fixed dose combination F/TAF/R offers an alternative option to Eviplera with which similar efficacy can be 
expected. The improved renal safety profile allows the administration in patients with estimated creatinine 
clearance > 30 ml/min and no dose adjustments are required. However the potential risk of nephrotoxicity 
from chronic exposure cannot be excluded and deserves to be monitored. Based on the evaluation of quality, 
efficacy and safety data the benefit-risk balance is favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Odefsey for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with 
body weight at least 35 kg) infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) without known mutations 
associated with resistance to the non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class, tenofovir or 
emtricitabine and with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV 1 RNA copies/mL (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1), is 
favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of data, the CHMP considers that the active substance tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 
contained in the medicinal product Odefsey is a derivative of tenofovir disoproxil (both prodrugs of tenofovir). 
The active substance tenofovir alafenamide is contained in the marketing authorisation Genvoya which was 
authorised in the Union on 19/11/2015. Tenofovir alafenamide is therefore not a new active substance in 
itself, as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0107/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

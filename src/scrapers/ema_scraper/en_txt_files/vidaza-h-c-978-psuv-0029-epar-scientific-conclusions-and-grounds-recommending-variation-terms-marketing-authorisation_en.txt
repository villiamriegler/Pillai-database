Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Vidaza, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Upon request of regulatory authorities, the MAH performed a cumulative safety review of cases of 
necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The occurrence was 11 NF cases and 2 well documented literature reports, 
including 6 fatal cases. The data provided was supportive of a causal relation with azacitidine therapy; 
therefore the risk of necrotizing fasciitis should be included in the product information. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Vidaza, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance azacitidine is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

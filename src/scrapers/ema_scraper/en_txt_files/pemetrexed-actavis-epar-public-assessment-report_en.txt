2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This submission concerns a hybrid application for pemetrexed concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Pemetrexed Actavis 100 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg Concentrate for Solution for Infusion has the same 
active substance and the same excipients in comparable amounts to the centrally approved reference 
medicinal product Alimta (EU/1/04/290/001-002). After reconstitution, each vial contains 25 mg/ml of 
pemetrexed. 
The claimed indication for Pemetrexed Actavis is: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients 
with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Pemetrexed  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  other  than  predominantly  squamous  cell  histology  in  patients 
whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Pemetrexed  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  second-line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
As monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin, the recommended dose of pemetrexed is 500 mg/m2 
of body surface area (BSA) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of 
each 21-day cycle. 
Pemetrexed Actavis must be diluted prior to use.  
About the product 
Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial 
folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
Mode of action 
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT) and aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase 
(AICARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and 
purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed gains entry to the cell via the reduced folate carrier (RFC) and proton 
coupled folate transporter (PCFT). In the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly converted to polyglutamate forms 
bynthe enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.  
The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 
Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a 
lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life 
resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 25 mg/ml of 
pemetrexed (as pemetrexed diacid) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: trometamol, anhydrous citric acid, cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, and 
water for injection. 
The product is available in colourless glass vial (type I) with type I rubber (bromobutyl) serum stopper 
and an aluminium cap with polypropylene disk as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of pemetrexed diacid monohydrate is N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-
pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-Glutamic acid, monohydrate and has the following 
structure: 
A series of analysis methods were applied to verify the structure: peak purity, elemental analysis (EA), 
ultraviolet/visible absorption spectrophotometry (UV/VIS) and molar absorptivity, infrared absorption 
spectrophotometry (IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), and 
electrical conductivity. 
The active substance is a white or almost white powder, practically insoluble in water, anhydrous 
ethanol, and methylene chloride, and is slightly hygroscopic. Pemetrexed contains a single chiral centre 
and is synthesised as the single L-isomer. The D-isomer (Impurity E) is limited in the active substance 
specification. Based on XRPD test results, the crystalline form of the active substance is Form B. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is synthesised in one manufacturing site. 
Pemetrexed is synthesized in nine main steps by 5 well defined starting materials. During evaluation, 
re-definition of the proposed starting material was requested by CHMP as a large part of the full 
synthesis including incorporation of structural elements and stereochemistry was outside the proposed 
Assessment report

route falling under GMP requirements. The re-defined starting materials are controlled by acceptable 
specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Pemetrexed  diacid  is  packed  in  two  layers  of  pharmaceutical  LDPE  (Low-Density  polyethylene)  bags 
and then sealed in aluminium foil bag. The polymer used for the manufacturing of LDPE complies with 
the requirement for food contact material legislation. The polymer also complies with the requirement 
of Ph. Eur. and with EU Regulation 1183/2012. The specifications of the LDPE bag and aluminium foil 
bag are presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification (UV, IR, 
HPLC), clarity of solution (Ph Eur), color of solution (Ph Eur), water (Ph Eur), heavy metals, residue of 
ignition (Ph Eur), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur), 
microbial limit (Ph Eur), and assay (HPLC).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the 
reference standards has been provided. 
Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for 12 months under long term conditions at -20 ºC ± 5 ºC 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 5 ºC ± 3 ºC according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. 
The following parameters are tested during stability study: appearance, identification by HPLC, clarity 
and colour of solution, water, related substances, enantiomer and assay. The analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were shown to be stability indicating. 
The batches meet the acceptance criteria in the specification and showed no change during the 
storage. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 3 batches. Photostability 
results of three batches meet the acceptance criteria in the specification thus it is concluded that no 
additional light protection packaging is needed for the active substance. 
Additional accelerate stability studies under conditions of 40 ºC ± 2 ºC / 75% ± 5% RH and long term 
study under conditions of 25 ºC ± 2 ºC / 60% ± 5% RH were performed on three validation batches 
manufactured from redefined starting materials. The test results up to 3 months meet the acceptance 
criteria and no significant changes were observed during the storage. Only 3 months results are 
available hence it is not possible to make extensive conclusions on the stability at these conditions. 
Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the manufacturer should continue the study and in case no 
changes are detected the manufacturer could take it into account to set the storage conditions to be 
less restrictive.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months stored in a 
freezer (-20ºC±5ºC) and keep the container tightly closed to protect from moisture.   
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product has been developed as a concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion 
intended to be diluted with 5% glucose solution. There are no objections either form the quality or 
from the clinical point of view to accept glucose as diluent. The finished product is a sterile, clear and 
colourless to slightly yellowish or yellow-greenish solution. 
A letter from the applicant dated 5 November 2015 was received requesting for the product only to be 
authorised for administration in 5% glucose solution on the basis of the existence of a relevant usage 
patent regarding administration of the product in saline.   
The finished product Pemetrexed Actavis 25 mg/ml – Concentrate for solution for infusion (100 mg/4 
ml; 500 mg/20 ml; 1000 mg/40 ml) was developed as a hybrid to the reference product Alimta powder 
for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  (100  mg/vial;  500  mg/vial)  authorized  in  the  Community  via 
the  centralized  procedure.  Pemetrexed  Actavis  25  mg/ml  -  Concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion 
contains  the  same  active  substance  as  the  reference  product  Alimta,.  It  has  an  identical  content  of 
active  substance  per  vial  (as  pemetrexed  free  base)  as  the  reference  product  Alimta,  for  the 
presentation  forms  100  mg  pemetrexed/vial  and  500  mg  pemetrexed/vial.  The  pharmaceutical  form 
(concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion)  is  different  than  the  reference  product  Alimta  (powder  for 
concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion).    Pemetrexed  Actavis  has  the  same  concentration  of  active 
ingredient  like  Alimta  (25  mg/ml  of  pemetrexed  active  moiety).  In  powder  form,  Alimta  is  a  salt  - 
pemetrexed  disodium  salt;  once  reconstituted/diluted  for  administration,  the  ions  are  dissociating  in 
water. 
The aim of the development of the product Pemetrexed 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion 
100 mg/4 ml, 500 mg/20 ml and 1g/40 ml was: 
-  A  finished  product  presented  as  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  simplifying  the 
administration by eliminating the first reconstitution step; 
-  A  finished  product  with  three  commercial  presentation  forms  of  Pemetrexed  Actavis  25  mg/ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion: 100 mg/4 ml, 500 mg/20 ml and 1000 mg/40 ml; 
-  A  finished  product  having  an  identical  content  of  active  substance  per  vial  (100  mg  of 
pemetrexed; 500 mg of pemetrexed) as the reference product Alimta; 
- An additional 1000 mg strength of pemetrexed, which is proportional in quantitative composition 
to the other two presentations and which also results in a concentration of 25mg/ml.  
The  active  substance  used  for  the  product  development  is  pemetrexed  diacid,  which  is  insoluble  in 
water.  In  order  to  obtain  the  pemetrexed  solution,  stabilising  base  compounds  that  provide  counter 
ions  to  the  pemetrexed  diacid,  forming  water  soluble  base  addition  salts  were  proposed: 
diethanolamine,  trometamol  and  meglumine.  L-Cysteine  and  trisodium  citrate  were  added  as 
antioxidants and stabilizer. 
The excipients used in the formulation of Pemetrexed  Actavis25 mg/ml – Concentrate for solution for 
infusion are trometamol, anhydrous citric acid, cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, water for injection 
Assessment report  
EMA/523246/2016 (Pemetrexed Actavis) 
Page 10/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  nitrogen.  The  excipients  are  in  compliance  with  current  Ph  Eur.  Trometamol  is  a  mildly  alkaline 
chemical  compound  used  in  a  wide  variety  of  pharmaceutical  preparations,  where  it  serves  as  buffer 
(pH  =  7.0  –  8.0),  neutralizer,  solubilizer  and  stabilizer.  Citric  acid  anhydrous  is  used  as  antioxidant 
synergist.  Cysteine  hydrochloride  monohydrate  is  aα-amino  acid  with  a  thiol  side  chain  used  as  an 
antioxidant. Water for injection is used as solvent to obtain the pemetrexed solution. Nitrogen is used 
as a technological additive in the phases of pemetrexed solution preparation and filtrations and in the 
phase of vial closing in order to limit the oxidative degradation reactions. 
The  proposed  product  Pemetrexed    Actavis  25  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  has  three 
strengths (100 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg), whereas the reference product has only two (100 mg and 
500 mg). As dosing is performed on a mg/m2 basis, the use of the proposed 1000 mg strength does 
not result in the administration of a higher dose to the patient. Taking an average adult body surface 
area of 1.6 m2 (female) and 2.0 m2 (male) and the maximum dosing regimen, a patient would need to 
receive between 800 mg and 1000 mg pemetrexed. Therefore commercialising a larger strength could 
be  more  convenient  for  healthcare  professionals  in  some  circumstances  and  will  allow  the  pysician’s 
choice  in  the  vials  selected  to  prepare  an  individual  patient’s  dose.  The  bulk  formulation  and 
manufacturing process of the 1000 mg preparation are stated to be identical to those of the proposed 
100  mg  and  500  mg  presentations.  Consequently,  no  additional  safety  or  efficacy  studies  are 
necessary to support the 1000 mg strength. 
Physico-chemical  studies  demonstrated  that  both  test  and  reference  products  contain  pemetrexed 
active moiety dissociated in an ionic solution in a similar manner. When further diluted for intravenous 
administration, both Alimta and Pemetrexed Actavis have the same concentration of active ingredient. 
The  extrapolated  concentration  of  1000  mg  vial  of  Actavis  is  the  same  per  unit  (ml)  as  the  one  of 
smaller  vials  of  Alimta.  Therefore,  adding  the  1000  mg  vial  does  not  imply  any  changes  in 
administration  of  the  product,  it  just  addresses  the  need  of  facilitating  the  product  administration 
(average dosage per patient is 900 mg, so diluting from one vial is easier). 
Given  the  change  in  formulation,  the  applicant  analysed  in  depth  the  existing  differences  and 
performed  comparative physicochemical  and  non-clinical  studies to  demonstrate equivalence between 
the proposed product and Alimta. 
The comparative studies that have been conducted to demonstrate equivalence between the proposed 
product  and  Alimta  are  provided. Both in-vitro  studies  performed  demonstrated  the  similar  behaviour 
of  reference  and  hybrid  medicinal  product  on  both  intracellular  uptake  and  renal  elimination.  The 
studies are detailed in the Nonclinical Overview and the full study reports are enclosed in Module 4. 
At the time of the pharmaceutical development, after the formulation was defined, the finished product 
was stored in a normal and reversed position at 56°C in order to study the influence of the head space 
volume, the type of the gas bubbled in the solution and the compatibility of the solution with selected 
stoppers.  It  was  showed  that  at  higher  head  space, the  degradation  increased  as  it  was  indicated by 
the assay values and the purity profile. On the other hand, it was noticed that for the finished product 
bubbled with N2, the degradation was not so advanced as in the case of air bubbling (for same solution 
volume and vial capacity) which justifies the use of N2 bubbling. 
A  further  study  was  performed  on  1  batch  to  evaluate  that  the  active  substance  in  Pemetrexed  25 
mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion did not racemize under stress temperature conditions (60 
°C after 4 and 7 days) and light exposure (22 hours at 1.32 million lux and integrated near ultraviolet 
energy  of  495  watt/  m2,  at  25°C  +  2°C,  on  vials  placed  in  both  upright  and  inverted  positions;  the 
vials rapped with aluminium foil have been used as dark control). The results showed that Pemetrexed 
active ingredient in Pemetrexed 25 mg/ml, concentrate for solution for infusion does not racemize after

both  thermal  and  light  stress:  the  enantiomeric  purity  in  stressed  samples  does  not  change  with 
respect to its content in the unstressed sample. 
Compatibility  with  5% glucose  solution,  ie  stability  of  the  finished  product  after  dilution  have  been 
studied under experimental conditions which simulate the recommendations for preparing and storing 
the  product  prior  to  administration,  as  indicated  in  the  product  information.  The  study  covered  all 
aspects  known  in  medical  practice  and  the  results  demonstrated  the  physicochemical  and 
microbiological stability of the diluted solution is satisfactory. 
In  order  to  select  the  sterilisation  method,  the  requirements  of  the  guide  CPMP/QWP/054/98  – 
“Decision trees for the selection of sterilization methods” (Annex to Note for Guidance on Development 
Pharmaceutics) were considered. The results obtained during the preformulation tests showed that the 
aqueous solution of 25 mg/ml pemetrexed diacid is not chemically stable under autoclaving conditions. 
The results obtained for one batch at the end of one and two autoclaving cycles (15 minutes at 121°C) 
were  presented.  After  autoclaving  the  colour  of  the  solution  changed  from  colourless  to  dark  green-
yellow  (more  intensely  coloured  than  reference  solution  and  the  level  of  impurities  increased).  Also, 
the  level  of  the  unknown  impurity  increased.  Since  sterilisation  by  moist  heat  is  not  applicable, 
according  to  the  decision  tree  for  sterilisation  choices  for  aqueous  products  (CPMP/QWP/054/98)  the 
use of a combination of aseptic filtration and aseptic processing (filling) was selected.  
The  choice  of  filter  type  was  based  on  the  solution  type  designated  to  be  processed,  the  solution 
compatibility  with  the  component  material  of  the  filter,  its  porosity,  as  well  as  on  the  efficiency  of 
sterilization  by  filtration.  The  Pall  filter  with  polyvinyliden  fluoride  membranes,  0.45  µm  and  0.2  µm 
pore size were proposed for experimental and production scale processing of the product, in order to 
validate the industrial manufacturing process. 
The  packaging  materials  used  as  primary  package  (clear  glass  vials  type  I,  bromobutylic  rubber 
closures type I) are considered as standard for this type of pharmaceutical dosage form Teflon coated 
bromobutylic  rubber  stoppers  were  selected  knowing  that  FluroTec®  coated  stoppers  provide  an 
effective barrier against most organic/inorganic extractable/leachables to minimize interaction between 
the drug and the stopper. Type I colourless glass vials meet the requirements of Ph.Eur. <3.2.1>.The 
closure complies with the Type I requirements for rubber closures as defined in monograph <3.2.9> of 
the  current  Ph.  Eur.  Tests  and  specifications  together  with  certificates  of  analysis  from  the  suppliers 
and manufacturers of the finished product have been provided. The suitability of the proposed closure 
system with the proposed formulation was investigated by studying their compatibility of the product. 
The  integrity  of  the  container  closure  system  is  ascertained  by  the  results  obtained  for  the 
microbiological  parameters  “Sterility”  and  “Bacterial  endotoxins”  at  product  release.,  and  should  be 
reconfirmedby  the  results  of  the  stability  study.  The  integrity  of  the  container  closure  system  is  also 
demonstrated  by  the  qualification  of  performances  tests  for  the  vial  filling  and  closing  machine,  tests 
performed  by  using  1  ‰  methylene  blue  solution  and  105  cfu/  ml  microorganisms  suspension. 
Compatibility studies with the rubber stopper have been performed, the stopper is compatible with the 
finished product formulation. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured in one manufacturing site. 
The  manufacturing  process  involves  the  following  steps:  preparation  of  bulk  solution,  pre-filtration, 
first  and  second  sterilising  filtration,  filling  and  stoppering,  filled  vial  washing  and  labelling  and 
packaging. All the manufacturing operations are conducted under nitrogen blanketing or bubbling until 
stoppering.

Critical  steps  and  process  parameters  that  are  considered  critical  for  the  quality  of  the  product  were 
identified and are controlled by in-process controls adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process.  As  a  non-standard 
manufacturing  process  is  used,  the  validation  was  performed  on  three  consecutive  commercial  scale 
batches  of  each  concentration.  Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  (hold  time,  media  fill, 
filtration  and  container  closure  integrity)  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance,  colour  (Ph  Eur),  clarity  (Ph  Eur),  pH  (PH  Eur),  visible  particles  (Ph  Eur),  visible  particles 
(Ph  Eur),  sub-visible  particles  (Ph  Eur),  extractable  volume  (Ph  Eur),  osmolality  and  osmolarity 
(Ph Eur), identification (HPLC, TLC), assay (HPLC),  degradation products (HPLC), bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph Eur) and sterility (Ph Eur).  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards of 
active substance and impurities has been presented. 
During evaluation, the applicant agreed to tighten the limits for impurities according to the presented 
stability  results.  Most of  the  limits  are  set  according  to the  qualification  threshold  of  0.2%  except for 
Impurity  RRT  0.43.  A  limit  of  NMT  0.4%  is  proposed  based  on  the  stability  results  and  toxicological 
study.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  this  can  be  accepted  at  the  moment  but  recommended  that  the  limit 
should  be  re-revaluated  once  the  stability  studies  have  been  completed  up  to  36  month  period  as 
foreseen by the applicant. The limit for total impurities can be accepted on the same grounds.   
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Three production scale batches (1 per concentration) were subjected to stability studies as per the ICH 
guidelines under refrigerated (2 to 8 °C), long-term (25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH), intermediate (30 ± 
2°C/75 ± 5% RH) for up twelve months and accelerated (40 ± 1°C/75 ± 5% RH) conditions for up to 
six months. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Testing was performed on appearance, clarity and colour, visible particles, sub-visible particles, pH, 
assay and degradation products, bacterial endotoxins, and sterility. The analytical methods used for 
testing of the stability samples are the same as the methods used for release testing. 
The  solution  remained  clear  during  stability  studies,  but  intensifications  in  the  solutions  colour  were 
observed, especially for some batches of the presentation form of 100 mg/ml, with results out of the 
specification.  The  obtained  results  for  the  assay  show  a  very  slight  decrease,  but  remain  around  the 
theoretical value of 25 mg/ml. Some results for degradation products show an increase from the initial 
moment.  
Pemetrexed  Actavis  is  presented  as  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  stored  in  glass  vials.  The 
product however is not stable at higher temperatures and the storage conditions 5 ± 3°C are proposed

for the shelf life of the product. The tests for visible and sub-visible particles are included in the shelf 
life specifications as an additional assurance if any delamination issues may occur. 
Photostability  studies  were  also  performed on  production  scale batch  by  exposure  to  light in  a  Xenon 
lamp  to  a  total  light  energy  of  minimum  1.2  million  lux  hour  for  14  hours  considered  as  the  worse 
scenario  of  photostability  study  condition,  covering  the  exposure  to  an  integrated  near  ultraviolet 
energy  of  minimum  200  Watt  hour/m2  (exposure  for  3.4  hours).  An  accelerated  photochemical 
degradation  study  was  performed  by  exposure  to  light  in  a  Xenon  lamp  to  a  total  light  energy  of 
minimum 1.2 million lux for 22 hours on an R&D batch. Based on the photostability tests performed by 
the  active  substance  manufacturer  and  cumulated  with  finished  product  manufacturer,  it  was 
demonstrated that both active substance and finished product are light sensitive, therefore the finished 
product should be protected from light in an outer carton. 
The  finished  product  was  also  subjected  to  various  forced  degradation  studies  in  order  to  obtain 
information  about  the  degradation  pathways  and  potential  degradation  products.  These  studies  were 
performed during the manufacturing development phase, and also as part of the photostability studies 
and  analytical  method  validation.  Stress-testing  was  conducted  by  exposing  the  finished  product  to 
thermos  (80°C  for  7  hours),  photo  (6  hours  at  photo  light  (1.2  million  lux  hours/200  Watts/m2)), 
acidic  (0.1N  HCl  for  36  hours  at  56  °C),  alkaline  (1  N  NaOH  for  16  hours  at  56  °C)  and  oxidative 
degradation  (1  %  H2O2  for  7  hours  at  56  °C).  Based  on  the  results,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the 
finished  product  is  sensible  to  alkaline  degradation,  oxidative  stress  and  thermal  degradation  and  it 
was shown that the proposed analytical methods are stability indicating.  
In use stability studies were performed in order to evaluate the physicochemical stability of the diluted 
solutions  (10  mg/mL  and  4  mg/mL)  for  Pemetrexed  Actavis  25  mg/mL  –  concentrate  for  solution  for 
infusion. The concentrations of the diluted solutions, 4 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml, were established based 
on the therapeutic indications of minimum and maximum recommended daily dose. 
The in-use stability study of diluted solutions has been a concern; therefore it was performed from the 
beginning of finished product pharmaceutical development in order to study the behaviour of the 
diluted solutions.  
Diluted  solution  stability  studies  were  performed  under  different  conditions  of  temperature  and 
container available at different time points during this application (6 months shelf life at submission, 9 
and 12 months shelf life at the time of this response preparation). The diluted solution stability studies 
protocols and results conducted on finished products having 12 months shelf life were provided and are 
considered satisfactory. 
Based  on  the  in-use  stability  results  chemical  and  physical  in-use  stability  of  infusion  solution  of 
pemetrexed was demonstrated for 24 hours at refrigerated temperature. From a microbiological point 
of  view,  the  product  should  be  used  immediately.  If  not  used  immediately,  in-use  storage  times  and 
conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C 
to 8°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life for the unopened vial of 18 months, and the 
proposed  storage  conditions  “Store  and  transport  refrigerated  (2°C to 8°C).  Do  not  freeze.  Keep  the 
vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are 
acceptable.

No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the  finished product 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- The manufacturer of the active substance should continue the accelerated stability studies and in 
case no changes are detected the manufacturer could take it into account to set the storage conditions 
to be less restrictive. 
- The limits for Impurity RRT 0.43 and total impurities in the finished product specifications should be 
re-revaluated and if necessary tightened once the stability studies have been completed up to 36 
month period as foreseen by the applicant. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  have  shown  that  pemetrexed  had  activity  against  a  variety  of  tumour 
types,  including  non-small  cell  lung,  breast,  bladder,  head  and  neck,  and  ovarian  cancers,  as  well  as 
mesothelioma. 
A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. In addition, in order to further support 
the  application,  Actavis  has  conducted  comparative  pharmaceutical  studies  designed  to  demonstrate 
that the change in formulation and existing difference in excipients and the use of tromethamine salt 
do not impact the safety and efficacy of the product. The Applicant further investigated the degree of 
similarity between the test and reference product in two in vitro studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data on the pemetrexed have been adequately presented in review articles, 
monographs, and standard drug manuals (Eli Lilly Product Information Alimta 2004, 2011, 2012; Eli 
Lilly Product Monograph Canada, 2012; NDA-21-462, EMA Scientific Discussion Alitma, 2004; Alimta Eli 
Lilly SPC, 2012, etc.). 
Pemetrexed was administered intravenously by the route intended for use in man. After single 
intravenous doses administered to mice, dogs, and human, plasma concentration of pemetrexed 
declined in a biphasic manner, a rapid distribution phase followed by a longer terminal elimination 
phase. 
The AUC increased in a dose-dependent manner over the tested dosages (20-100 mg/kg). 
Approximately 90% of the active drug is excreted unchanged in urine. The elimination half-life was 
short in dogs compared to mice. The PK of pemetrexed in mice, dogs and man after single doses were 
similar. 
The Applicant has conducted a comparative study to evaluate the Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta as 
substrates of human OAT3 mediated transport in vitro. The products were studied in the concentration 
range of 10 – 500 µM. The studies demonstrated the similarity of transport through OAT3 of both 
tested products. 
Study OPT-2014-136: “Assessment of Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta as substrates of 
human RFC and PCFT mediated transport.” 
The purpose of the study is to determine whether Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are transported by 
human PCFT (proton-coupled folate transporter) and RFC (reduced folate carrier).  
The uptake test systems for PCFT and RFC consisted of a polarized monolayer of MDCK-II cells grown 
on permeable supports. The MDCK-II cells were treated to express the transporter of interest or 
treated with a control vector. Experiments were performed under the same conditions for the cells 
expressing the transporter and for those treated with the control vector. Cells were seeded on 96-well 
plates approximately 24 hours before transfection. Transport assays were carried out approximately 48 
hours after transfection. 
The transport of the probe substrate was determined by radiometric detection. The transport of 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta was determined by LC/MS/MS. 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta 100 mg dosage form was used for this experiment. 
Data Analysis 
1. PCFT and RFC Transporter: Net transporter mediated uptake of substrate by the PCFT or RFC is 
calculated by subtracting uptake in the control system, which does not express the transporter of 
interest, from uptake in the test system which does express the transporter of interest. 
Net Transporter Mediated Substrate Uptake = (Cellular accumulation in the presence of the 
transporter) - (Mean cellular accumulation in the absence of the transporter) 
2. Kinetic Analysis: The Km and Vmax are calculated by non-linear regression using the Michaelis-
Menten equation. 
Criteria for acceptable control values for transport: 
• 
PCFT-mediated methotrexate uptake: ≥ 0.558 pmol/min/cm2 
•  RFC-mediated methotrexate uptake: ≥ 0.095 pmol/min/cm2

Ca2+ and Mg2+ free buffer for RFC mediated transport. A dose dependent increase in uptake of both 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta was observed (Table 4, Table 5). The Km values for Pemetrexed 
Actavis and Alimta are 1.95 µM ± 0.436 µM and 3.15 µM ± 1.47 µM, respectively (Figure 2). The Vmax 
values for Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are 0.410 ± 0.0240 pmol/min/cm2 and 0.524 ± 0.0743 
pmol/min/cm2.

Study OPT-2014-058: “Assessment of Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta as substrates of 
human OAT3 mediated transport 
The purpose of the study is to determine whether Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are transported by 
human OAT3.  
The uptake test system for OAT3 consisted of a polarized monolayer of MDCK-II cells grown on 
permeable supports. The MDCK-II cells were treated to express the transporter of interest or treated 
with a control vector. Experiments were performed under the same conditions for the cells expressing 
the transporter and for those treated with the control vector. Cells were seeded on 96-well plates 
approximately 24 h before transfection. Transport assays were carried out approximately 48 h after 
transfection. Positive control was 10 µM [H3]-p-aminohippurate. 
The transport of the probe substrate was determined by radiometric detection. The transport of 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta was determined by LC/MS/MS.

Data Analysis 
1. OAT3 Transporter: Net transporter mediated uptake of substrate by the OAT3 is calculated by 
subtracting uptake in the control system, which does not express the transporter of interest, from 
uptake in the test system which does express the transporter of interest. 
Net Transporter Mediated Substrate Uptake = (Cellular accumulation in the presence of the 
transporter) - (Mean cellular accumulation in the absence of the transporter) 
2. Kinetic Analysis: The Km and Vmax are calculated by non-linear regression using the Michaelis-
Menten equation. 
Criteria for acceptable control values for transport: 
•  OAT3-mediated p-aminohippurate uptake: ≥0.287 pmol/min/cm2 
Criteria for acceptable control values for reference inhibition: 
• 
Percent inhibition of human OAT3 mediated aminohippurate uptake by 100 µM probenecid: 
≥80.7% 
Results 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta were studied in the concentration range of 10 - 500 µM (7 total) in 
Ca2+ and Mg2+ free buffer. A dose dependent increase in uptake of both Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta 
was observed (Table 6, Table 7). The Km values for Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are 11.7 µM ± 
2.99 µM and 11.6 µM ± 3.25 µM, respectively (Figure 3). The Vmax values for Pemetrexed Actavis and 
Alimta are 8.12 ± 0.389 pmol/min/cm2 and 8.77 ± 0.444 pmol/min/cm2. Km and Vmax determined 
experimentally are similar for Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta.

In conclusion 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta were studied in the concentration range of 10 - 500 µM. A dose 
dependent increase in uptake of both Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta was observed. The Km values for 
Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are 11.7 and 11.6 µM, respectively. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology studies were submitted. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Pemetrexed Actavis manufactured by Actavis Group PTC ehf is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all pemetrexed containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar 
and not increased. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant presented in vitro studies and literature data. The scientific literature submitted is 
relevant for the pemetrexed and excipients (trometamol, citric acid and L-cysteine). There is a lack of 
the safety pharmacology published studies but these are not critical for this type of Application. 
According to the EPAR of Alimta, because of better transport efficiency, RFC is likely to be the main 
carrier for pemetrexed, as in the case for natural folates. PCFT has been more recently described and 
its physiological role is not entirely clear. It is well established that pemetrexed is actively secreted by 
OAT3. Both studies used standard experimental conditions in respect to cell system (MDCK-II cells), 
positive controls (methotrexate and p-aminohippurate, respectively), over a wide range of pemetrexed 
concentrations. According to the EPAR of Alimta, peak circulating levels of pemetrexed approach 200

µg/ml (468 µM) in humans. For OAT3 study pemetrexed concentration tested ranged from 10-500 µM, 
and is appropriate. For folate transporter studies, pemetrexed concentration ranged from 0.03-30 µM 
and 0.1-100 µM. No justification was provided on the selected range of concentrations.  
No apparent differences in the observed Km and Vmax values were seen for Pemetrexed Actavis and 
Alimta. However, from a clinical point of view it is difficult to define maximum allowed difference in the 
Km and Vmax values to result in clinically significant differences in PK or PD. On these grounds, these 
studies are considered supportive.  
Physico-chemical characterisation in comparative pharmaceutical studies is considered pivotal for this 
application. Data provided demonstrate saturation of transporters at very low pemetrexed 
concentrations. Raw data provided supportive internal validity of the results. 
The toxicity profile of pemetrexed remains unchanged. The safety profile of excipients in parenteral 
drug products administered IV is well known, and relatively large doses are currently administered to 
humans in various drug products; therefore, no safety concern regarding their dosage is expected. No 
new toxicology studies are required for this application.  
The bulk formulation and manufacturing process 1000 mg/vial preparation of the Pemetrexed Actavis 
is identical to those of the Alimta (100 and 500 mg/vial) presentations. Consequently, no additional 
safety or efficacy studies are necessary to support the Pemetrexed Actavis 1000 mg/vial strength. 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The in vitro pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that Pemetrexed Actavis has 
the same similar intracellular uptake and renal elimination profiles as the reference product Alimta. 
Given the fact that the products are administered intravenously, and their transport and elimination 
mechanisms are comparable, the CHMP agrees that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for concentrate for solution for infusion containing pemetrexed.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of pemetrexed based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
2.4.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
Exemption  
The  application  has  been  submitted  under  Article  10.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  (i.e.  hybrid 
application),  due  to  the  differences  in  terms  of  pharmaceutical  form  (concentrate  for  solution  for

infusion  instead  of  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion)  and  addition  of  1000  mg/vial 
strength. No bioequivalence studies have been conducted. 
Reference  product  disodium  pemetrexed  is  chemically  synthesized  and  purified.  Its  molecular 
formula is C20H19N5O6Na2 and its molecular weight is 597.49 Da. 
The structural formula is as follows: 
Disodium  pemetrexed  is  an  ionic  compound  being  able  to  dissociate  in  plasma  to  release  the  ionic 
molecule  active  drug.  Supporting  evidence  is  provided  by  Li  Li  et  al,  2011  study,  demonstrating  that 
pemetrexed molecule is mostly dissociated at physiological pH. The authors correlated the pH with the 
antifolates binding capacity to cell receptors, the polar molecule of pemetrexed is described as having 
2  negative  charges  at  pH  7.0.  Pemetrexed  (PMX)  is  a  polyelectrolyte  carrying  two  carboxyl  groups, 
with pKa of 3.46 (α-carboxyl) and 4.77 (γ-carboxyl), and the guanidinic N-1 on the pterine ring (pKa 
5.27).  At  physiological  pH,  PMX  exists  in  a  predominantly  negatively  charged  form  because  of  the 
deprotonation of the two carboxyl groups. 
Pemetrexed  Actavis  contains  diacid  pemetrexed  which  has  a  chemical  formula  of  C20H21N5O6 
and a molecular mass of 427.5g/mol. Its chemical name is N-[4-[2-(2-Amino-4, 7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-
pyrrolo  [2,  3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)  ethyl]  benzoyl]-L-glutamic  acid  and  it  has  the  following  chemical 
structure: 
Pemetrexed  diacid  is  practically  insoluble  in  water,  ethanol  anhydrous  and  methylene  chloride. 
Pemetrexed  is  white  or  almost  white  powder,  slightly  hygroscopic.  The  structural  formula  or 
pemetrexed-ditromethamine  is  shown  below,  as  demonstrated  by  NMR  characterization  studies 
performed by the Applicant:

This  compound  is  formed  in-situ,  in  the  watery  solution,  from  diacid  pemetrexed  and  tromethamine 
(molar  report  1:2),  as  salt,  resulted  from  the  interaction  between  an  acid  and  a  base.  The  structure 
was  elucidated  by  the  Applicant  by  physico-chemical  studies  (detailed  in  the  Pharmaceutical 
Development section). 
Pemetrexed Actavis has the same concentration of active ingredient as Alimta. In powder form, Alimta 
is  a  salt  –  pemetrexed  disodium;  once  reconstituted/diluted  for  administration,  the  ions  are 
dissociating  in  water.  Actavis’  studies  demonstrated  that  both  test  and  reference  products  contain 
pemetrexed active moiety dissociated in a ionic solution in a similar manner. When further diluted for 
intravenous administration, both Alimta and Pemetrexed Actavis have the same concentration of active 
ingredient.  
The proposed Actavis product contains the following excipients: trometamol, L-Cysteine and citric acid 
and has no mannitol (which is present in Alimta; mannitol is very frequently used excipient in powder 
drugs). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been submitted. 
According  to the  SmPC  of  Alimta, pemetrexed  has  a  steady-state  volume  of distribution  of  9  l/m2.  In 
vitro  studies  indicate  that  pemetrexed  is  approximately  81  %  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Pemetrexed 
undergoes  limited  hepatic  metabolism.  Pemetrexed is  primarily  eliminated in  the  urine,  with  70 %  to 
90 % of the administered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following 
administration.  In  vitro  studies  indicate  that  pemetrexed  is  actively  secreted  by  OAT3  (organic  anion 
transporter).  Pemetrexed  total  systemic  clearance  is  91.8  ml/min  and  the  elimination  half-life  from 
plasma  is  3.5  hours  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  (creatinine  clearance  of  90  ml/min). 
Between  patient  variability  in  clearance  is  moderate  at  19.3  %.  Pemetrexed  total  systemic  exposure 
(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics of 
pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. 
As the originator and hybrid product are administered as IV solution, the bioavailability is considered to 
be  100%.  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Pemetrexed  Actavis  based  on  a  different  salt  is  not  expected  to 
differ from Alimta. 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application.

2.4.5.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data were submitted. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This application is based on quality, non-clinical studies and literature data. 
Pemetrexed 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion contains the same active substance as the 
reference product Alimta, but conjugated to a different salt (tromethamine salt instead of sodium salt).  
In order to support the application, Actavis has conducted comparative pharmaceutical studies 
designed to demonstrate that the change in formulation and existing difference in excipients and the 
tromethamine salt used do not impact in any way the safety and efficacy of the product.  
When diluted for administration, both products contain the same amount of pemetrexed as free base. 
In a watery environment, both products release the free Pemetrexed ions from the sodium and 
trometamol salts respectively. 
The Applicant investigated further the degree of similarity between the test and reference product in 
two in-vitro studies. 
Alimta and Pemetrexed Actavis were comparatively tested in an in vitro study OPT-2014-058, 
assessing the affinity of pemetrexed at renal level by OAT3 transporters. The study demonstrated the 
similarity of pemetrexed affinity to the OAT3 transporter from both Alimta and Pemetrexed Actavis 
formulations. Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta were studied in the concentration range of 10 - 500 µM. 
A dose dependent increase in uptake of both Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta was observed. The Km 
values for Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are 11.7 and 11.6 µM, respectively. 
Furthermore, in order to assess the similarity of drug transport inside the cell, the Applicant performed 
another in-vitro comparative study OPT-2014-136. The study was designed to evaluate the degree of 
similarity of Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta through human RFC (reduced folate carrier) and PCFT 
(proton coupled folate transporter) receptors. For PCFT, Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta were studied 
in the concentration range of 0.03 - 30 µM. The Km values for Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are 
0.0995 µM and 0.212 µM, respectively. For RFC, Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta were studied in the 
concentration range of 0.1 - 100 µM. The Km values for Pemetrexed Actavis and Alimta are 1.95 µM 
and 3.15 µM, respectively. 
In vitro studies with folate and OAT3 transporters demonstrated similar affinity of Pemetrexed Actavis 
and Alimta. However, from clinical point of view it is difficult to define maximum allowed difference in 
the Km and Vmax values to result in clinically significant differences in PK or PD. On these grounds, 
these studies are considered supportive. Physico-chemical characterisation in comparative 
pharmaceutical studies is considered pivotal for this application. 
As the active substance pemetrexed is widely used and well- known, the applicant has not provided 
additional clinical studies but a justification that further studies are not needed. The CHMP agrees with 
the justification. 
Appropriate data from published literature on pemetrexed were provided supporting the safe and 
effective use of Pemetrexed Actavis in the intended indications. 
Pemetrexed Actavis contains trometamol as an excipient. Trometamol is incompatible with cisplatin 
resulting in degradation of cisplatin. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal

products. Intravenous lines should be flushed after administration of Pemetrexed Actavis (see section 
6.6 of the SmPC). 
Pemetrexed Actavis is proposed to be diluted in 5% glucose solution. More rigorous post treatment 
serum glucose monitoring may be needed in patients with diabetes mellitus.  It is expected that the 
physician will take the general health status of the patient into account before treating patients with 
Pemetrexed Actavis. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Pemetrex Actavis and justifications that the 
different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety 
and efficacy of the reference product was provided and can be accepted by the CHMP. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

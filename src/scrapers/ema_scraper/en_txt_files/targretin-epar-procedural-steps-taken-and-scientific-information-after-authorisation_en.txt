are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and 
requested the PRAC to review the routine risk 
minimisation in place for the oral and topical 
retinoids to ensure the available data and the risks 
associated with the adverse teratogenic effects and 
neuropsychiatric disorders are accurately and 
consistently addressed within the product 
Page 4/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information where appropriate and justified by data. 
Furthermore, the PRAC was requested to review any 
additional risk minimisation measures to ensure that 
these are optimal in terms of provision of information 
and delivery of effective risk management that is 
subject to appropriate monitoring. The PRAC was 
called upon to assess the impact of the above 
concerns on the benefit-risk balance of retinoid-
containing medicinal products and issue a 
recommendation on whether the products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request resulted from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the PRAC 
issued a recommendation to the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

the Summary of Product characteristics, section 5.2: 
Pharmacokinetic Properties. 
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations  
Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
data for 232 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 343 patients 
aged < 65 years, age has no statistically significant effect 
on bexarotene pharmacokinetics.  
Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population 
pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a 
weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent 
clearance increases with increasing body weight.  Gender 
has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene 
pharmacokinetics.  
Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene 
pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians.  
There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences 
in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. 
In addition changes were introduced to bring the text in 
line with approved templates and changes to the contact 
details of local representatives were made.

with information regarding combination with CYP3A4 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic margin. 
In the absence of detailed information, caution must be 
advised in case of combination with CYP3A4 substrates 
having a narrow therapeutic margin i.e. 
immunosuppressive agents (ciclosporine, tacrolimus,

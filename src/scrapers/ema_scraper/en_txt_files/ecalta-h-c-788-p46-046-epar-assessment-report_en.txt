1.  Introduction 
On 28th September 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Ecalta, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. These data are also submitted as part 
of the post-authorisation measure (Follow Up Measure 021). A short critical expert overview has also 
been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study ‘A8851008 - A Prospective, Open-Label Study to Assess the 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of Anidulafungin when used to Treat Children with Invasive 
Candidiasis, including Candidemia’ is part of a clinical development program.  
The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing PK/PD data from 
several studies) is expected to be submitted by end of February 2019.  
Assessor’s comments 
The present study will be submitted in an upcoming type II variation application in which the MAH 
intends to extend the indication and include relevant paediatric data in the labelling. A preliminary 
assessment of study A8851008 is contained in the current assessment report.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
All subjects received IV anidulafungin as study drug. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
A8851008 - A Prospective, Open-Label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and 
Efficacy of Anidulafungin when used to Treat Children with Invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study design 
Study A8851008 was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multi-centre, multinational study 
designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of anidulafungin for the treatment 
of invasive candidiasis/candidaemia (ICC) in paediatric patients 1 month to <18 years of age.  
All study subjects received anidulafungin IV treatment (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on study day 1 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance dose daily thereafter), administered at a rate of 1.1 mg/min or 
less. Subjects were to receive anidulafungin IV for a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 35 days. 
There was an option to switch to oral treatment with fluconazole (6 to 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 
mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV treatment, provided the subject met pre-specified criteria. 
In order to confirm the appropriateness of the protocol’s study dosing regimen for the 1 month to <2 
years old age group, the first 6 children in this age group were enrolled in a PK sub-study in which 
intensive PK sampling was conducted at selected centres. The PK sub-study completed prior to protocol 
Amendment 8, therefore polysorbate 80 plasma concentrations were not assessed in these 6 subjects. 
Following initiation of treatment, blood samples (approximately 0.3 to 0.5 mL each) were collected for 
anidulafungin measurement at 6 time points as follows:  
-  On day 1 (receiving 3 mg/kg IV infusion): 2 minutes before the end of infusion 
-  On day 2 (receiving 1.5 mg/kg IV infusion): Just prior to the start of infusion; 2 minutes before 
the end of infusion, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the start of infusion 
Blood samples (approximately 0.3 to 0.5 mL each) for anidulafungin measurement and blood samples 
(approximately 1 mL each for subjects enrolled under protocol amendment 8) for polysorbate 80 
measurement were collected at 3 to 5 of the following time points during the study for all study 
subjects, with the exception of subjects in the PK sub-study: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
day 1: post-dose (between 0 and 2 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 3: pre-dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 5: post-dose (between 0 and 3 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 7: delayed post-dose (between 6 and 12 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 9: pre-dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion) 
Assessor’s comments 
In general the design of the pharmacokinetic part of study A8851008 is acceptable.  
Bioanalytical methods 
The plasma samples were analysed for anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 using validated high 
performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-/MS/MS). The 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for anidulafungin was 50.00 ng/mL. The LLOQ for polysorbate 80 
was 5.00 μg/mL. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 4/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Assessor’s comments 
The bioanalytical methods for both anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 are acceptable.  
Results 
Pharmacokinetic sub-study 
The final PK sub-study dataset included 6 anidulafungin concentrations per subject plus 1 
concentration prior to start of treatment. These data were obtained from the 6 subjects in the 1 month 
to <2 years age group who underwent intensive (serial) PK sampling. One subject did not have a 
sample at the end of loading dose on Day 1. 
The anidulafungin plasma concentrations for all 6 of the subjects are presented by subject and 
sampling time on Day 1 and 2. A descriptive summary of anidulafungin PK parameters from these 6 
subjects is presented and summarised in the table below. 
Anidulafungin exposures in these 6 subjects fell within the expected range for adult ICC patients dosed 
with 200 mg load followed by 100 mg/day, which supports dose selection for the youngest age group. 
Pharmacokinetic sparse sampling 
The PK dataset, excluding data from the 6 subjects enrolled in the PK sub-study, included 253 
anidulafungin plasma concentrations from 60 subjects (11 subjects from 1 month to <2 years; 19 
subjects 2 to <5 years; 30 subjects 5 to <18 years) who underwent sparse PK sampling. These data 
are presented for individual subjects by sampling time and age group, and will be combined with the 
PK sub-study and additional concentration data from other studies and analysed in a population PK 
analysis to be reported separately. The anidulafungin plasma concentrations from these 60 subjects 
generally fell within the expected ranges for adult ICC subjects dosed with 200 mg loading followed by 
100 mg per day. 
Polysorbate 80 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 5/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The final PK dataset contained 28 polysorbate 80 samples from 8 subjects (1 month to <2 years of 
age) enrolled under protocol amendment 8. These data are presented for individual subjects by 
sampling time and age group. 
Only one subject of the 8 subjects, a 20-month old white male weighing 13 kg, had one sample 
collected 5 hours post infusion on Day 1 which was above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ: 5.0 
µg/mL) with a polysorbate 80 concentration of 5.3 µg/ml. Otherwise, none of the other samples, 
including those for this subject, had detectable polysorbate 80 concentrations and they were all below 
the LLOQ. Therefore, plasma concentrations of polysorbate 80 were low or undetectable in infants 1 
month to <2 years of age following administration of anidulafungin 3.0 mg/kg loading and 1.5 mg/kg 
per day. 
Conclusions 
Anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 PK results support an anidulafungin dose recommendation of 3.0 
mg/kg load followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day for paediatric ICC patients aged 1 month to 17 years.  
The finding of extremely low/undetectable levels of polysorbate 80 post-infusion, along with safety 
results from the study, suggest that presence of this excipient in the anidulafungin formulation, at the 
recommended dose of anidulafungin, is not a safety issue in infants as young as 1 month of age. 
The PK/PD analyses in support of the PK/PD objective will be described in a separate report. 
Anidulafungin PK data collected in this study were combined with external PK data across other age 
groups, including neonates, adults and elderly, and will be reported separately in a comprehensive 
population PK/PD analysis. 
Assessor’s comments 
Conclusions on the results of pharmacokinetic characterisation are agreed upon. 
Discussion on pharmacokinetics 
Regarding the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin, the only results relevant to be discussed at this point 
are the results of the PK-sub study. Additional population pharmacokinetic model analyses (based on 
the pharmacokinetic sparse sampling of the full pharmacokinetic dataset including 253 anidulafungin 
plasma samples from 60 subjects) are still awaited and said to be presented in a separate report, at a 
later stage. 
The goal of the PK-sub study was to confirm the appropriateness of the dosing regimen for the 1 
month to <2 years old age group. It was concluded that anidulafungin exposure in these 6 sub-study 
subjects fell within the expected range for adult population, which supports the chosen dose regimen. 
This is agreed. Pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin seem to have been characterised adequately during 
this study. The dosing regimen of 3.0 mg/kg loading followed by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance in the 
population of 1 month to <2 years, resulted in exposures similar to those observed in the adult 
population. An AUC0-24 of 66.4 µg.hr/ml (28%CV) and Cmax of 5.96 µg/ml (29%CV) was observed for 
the first 6 subjects in the 1 month to <2 year age group, while for the adult population (at a loading 
dose of 200 mg and a daily dose of 100 mg) Cmax was about 7.2 μg/ml and AUCss 110 μg.h/ml. It is 
noted that the observed AUC is somewhat lower in the young age group, and the calculated AUC was 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 6/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
not based on measurements from steady state conditions. Nevertheless, the results do demonstrate an 
exposure in the youngest age group compared to adult patients which is in the same range and 
therefore support appropriateness of the dosing regimen of 3.0 mg/kg loading followed by 1.5 mg/kg 
maintenance the next day. 
However, in order to fully assess the pharmacokinetic behaviour of anidulafungin in the paediatric 
population, the awaited pharmacokinetic modelling is pivotal. Until then, no firm conclusions can be 
drawn. 
Further based on this study, in which polysorbate 80 was measured 5 hour post dose in samples from 
8 subjects in the month to <2 years of age group, concentrations of polysorbate 80 are not expected 
to be higher than 5.3 µg/ml in these patients.

Study population /Sample size 
Assessor’s comments 
The in- and exclusion criteria changed during the course of the study. See also under conduct of the 
study. 
Below are the inclusion criteria as per the final protocol amendment affecting these, Protocol 
Amendment 9, dated 16 September 2016.  
Prior to protocol Amendment 9 and at the time of enrolment, subjects must have had either a 
confirmed diagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida spp. from a culture obtained from a 
normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment), or mycological evidence highly suggestive of 
Candida spp. Subjects may have been enrolled and initiated study treatment prior to culture 
confirmation of Candida spp. If positive culture confirmation for Candida spp. was not obtained 
subjects were discontinued from treatment; however, such subjects remained in the study for 
continued safety monitoring for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrolment into the study: 
1. Subject must be either (1) at high risk for candidiasis or (2) have a definitive diagnosis of invasive 
candidiasis/candidaemia (ICC), as defined below: 
a. At high risk for candidiasis (subjects 1 month to < 2 years of age only): 
Subject is at high risk for candidiasis and antifungal therapy with anidulafungin for a minimum of 5 
days is considered appropriate by the investigator. 
--OR-- 
b. Definitive diagnosis of invasive candidiasis/candidaemia (ICC) (all age groups) is based on the 
growth of Candida spp. from a blood and/or tissue culture obtained from a normally sterile site. 
For the purpose of study entry, a subject enrolled with definitive diagnosis of ICC must have at least 
one microbiologic AND at least one clinical criterion listed below. 
Microbiologic Criteria: 
Subject must have at least one of the criteria listed below either at the time of study entry or within 96 
hours prior to study entry. 
•  Candidaemia: At least one blood culture positive for Candida spp. (in the absence of other 
demonstrated foci of infection) or; 
EMA/916359/2019

•  Other forms of invasive candidiasis: 
• 
• 
• 
Positive culture for Candida spp. from a specimen from a normally sterile site (other than blood), 
with or without a positive blood culture; 
Positive culture for Candida spp. from a percutaneous drain (eg, chest tube, intra-abdominal) 
placed <24 hours in a normally sterile site; 
Positive blood culture for Candida spp. plus ophthalmic examination consistent with Candida 
endophthalmitis; 
•  Candida endocarditis (not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites): At least one 
positive blood culture for Candida spp. and evidence of endocarditis on echocardiogram; 
•  Candida osteomyelitis (not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites): At least one 
positive culture for Candida spp. from a bone biopsy or aspirate and evidence of osteomyelitis on a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study; 
Clinical Criteria: 
1.  Subject must have at least one of the criteria listed below either at the time of study entry or 
within 96 hours prior to study entry. 
• 
Fever, defined as an oral/tympanic temperature ≥100.4°F (38.0°C), rectal temperature ≥101.4°F 
(38.6°C) or an axillary temperature ≥99.4°F (37.4°C); 
•  Hypothermia, defined as a temperature less than 96.8°F (36.0°C); 
•  Hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 100% for age and gender norms 
(per National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Working Group on Children and 
Adolescents guidelines); 
•  Other signs or symptoms of candidaemia/invasive candidiasis, which may include the following: 
feeding intolerance, bloody stools, abdominal distension, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, colour 
change, hyperglycaemia, glycosuria, unexplained metabolic acidosis. 
Subjects may be enrolled in the study and initiate study treatment on the basis of mycologic 
evidence highly suggestive of Candida spp. (e.g., the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct 
microscopic visualisation of yeast, hyphae, or pseudohyphae) from a sample obtained from a 
normally sterile site (e.g. blood and/or tissue). If culture confirmation of Candida spp. is not 
obtained, subjects may remain in the study and receive study treatment at the discretion of the 
investigator. Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study treatment, the 
subject will discontinued treatment but will remain in the study for continued safety monitoring for 
up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. Refer to Section 6.5 and Section 6.6 for 
follow-up visit requirements. 
Positive cultures for Candida spp. from urine (in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of 
pyelonephritis), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endotracheal aspiration, gastric drainage or 
gastric aspiration do not qualify as a positive culture for definitive diagnosis of ICC. 
2.  Male or female between the ages of 1 month and <18 years. 
3.  Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of 
contraception throughout the treatment period and up to the 6 week follow-up visit. A subject is of 
childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the investigator, he/she is biologically capable of having 
children and is sexually active. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 9/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
4.  For each subject, parent or legal guardian must be willing and able to provide signed and dated 
written informed consent documentation. Assent from the child or adolescent will be obtained as 
appropriate. This is to be obtained prior to enrolment. 
5.  Will be available for the duration of the study and be able to abide by the study restrictions. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study: 
1.  Subjects who are investigational site staff members or relatives of those site staff members or 
subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the trial. 
2.  Premature neonates born at gestation of less than 36 weeks (unless the sum of gestational age 
plus chronological age is at least 44 weeks).  
3.  Known history of intolerance, allergy, hypersensitivity or serious reaction to anidulafungin or any of 
its excipients (including fructose), or to other echinocandin antifungals. 
4.  Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential not using 
highly effective contraception or not agreeing to continue highly effective contraception during the 
treatment period and up to the 6 week follow-up visit.  
5.  Subjects who have failed antifungal therapy with any systemic echinocandin for this episode of 
candidiasis/candidaemia. Recurrence within 2 weeks is considered failure of previous therapy. 
6.  Subjects with any of the following abnormal laboratory values: Total bilirubin, AST or ALT >5 times 
the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
7.  Subjects who require continued treatment with another systemic antifungal agent [oral non-
absorbable azoles (e.g., clotrimazole troches) will be permitted]. Exception: the first 6 subjects 
enrolled who are between 1 month to <2 years of age may receive a second systemic antifungal 
agent at the investigator’s discretion.  
8.  Subjects with poor venous access that would preclude IV drug delivery or multiple blood draws. 
9.  Subjects who have participated in a study of an investigational drug or device (without any FDA 
and EMA approved indications) within four weeks of study entry. The investigational use of licensed 
agents are permitted if the subject is on a stable regimen for four weeks prior to study start, and 
expected to remain on the stable regimen for the duration of the trial. 
10. Life expectancy <72 hours. 
11. Subjects with suspected Candida meningitis. (For Korean and Portuguese investigator sites only: 
Subjects with suspected Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis are also excluded.) 
12. Subjects with a prosthetic device and/or vascular catheter (including central venous catheter or an 
implantable port) at a suspected site of infection are to be excluded, unless the device is removed 
or in situations where catheter salvage is desirable due to the subject's clinical condition. 
13. Subjects with a vascular graft suspected to be the site of the Candida infection and positive blood 
cultures. 
14. Subjects with prosthetic or native valve Candida endocarditis who have not and/or cannot undergo 
valvular replacement surgery prior to or soon after study entry. (Not applicable to Korean and 
Portuguese investigator sites.)  
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 10/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
15. Subjects with Candida osteomyelitis associated with a prosthetic device in whom the prosthetic 
device has not been and/or cannot be removed surgically prior to or soon after study entry. (Not 
applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)  
16. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, electrocardiogram (ECG) 
abnormalities, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study 
participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of 
study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for 
entry into this study. 
Assessor’s comments  
In and exclusion criteria have changed during the course of the study. The protocol was updated to 
broaden the study population to include children aged 1 month to <2 years only who were at high risk 
for candidiasis, in order to accelerate the availability of PK and safety data in this lowest age group as 
requested by the PDCO at the EMA. This could have changed the study population over the course of 
the study. The most impactful change in the protocol consists of protocol amendment 9.  
The MAH mentioned that despite the broadened entry criteria applied in Amendment 9, subjects 
enrolled under Amendment 9 were generally similar to those enrolled prior to the amendment, with 
only 2 subjects enrolled as being at high risk for ICC without microbiologically confirmed ICC. No 
further analyses are requested to analyse the impact of these protocol changes. 
Treatments 
All study subjects received anidulafungin IV treatment (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Study Day 1 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance dose daily thereafter). Subjects were to receive anidulafungin IV 
for a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 35 days. There was an option to switch to oral treatment 
with fluconazole (6 to 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV treatment, 
provided the subject met pre specified criteria.  
Subjects who were enrolled under Amendment 9 without microbiologically confirmed Candida infection 
were treated with IV anidulafungin (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Study Day 1 followed by 1.5 mg/kg 
maintenance dose daily thereafter) at the discretion of the Investigator for a minimum of 5 days to a 
maximum of 35 days. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
•  Safety and tolerability of anidulafungin. 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Global response of success, failure, or indeterminate at the EOIVT and subsequent time points 
(see description below) 
• 
• 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin in children aged 1 month to <2 years following IV 
infusion of anidulafungin: AUC24 and Cmax; 
Exposure-response (efficacy and safety endpoints) relationships of anidulafungin using a 
nonlinear mixed effects approach as appropriate; 
•  Rates of relapse at the Week 2 and Week 6 FU visits; 
•  Rates of emerging infection at the Week 2 and Week 6 FU visits; 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 11/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  All-cause mortality during study therapy and follow-up visits. 
Global response was defined as: 
•  Success: A subject was categorised as a success if there was both a clinical response of success 
(cure or improvement) and microbiological response of success (eradication or presumed 
eradication). 
• 
• 
Failure: A subject was categorised as a failure if there was a clinical response of failure and/or a 
microbiological failure (persistence or new infection at follow-up or relapse of infection at follow-
up). 
Indeterminate: A subject was categorised as indeterminate if there was a clinical response of 
indeterminate and/or microbiological response of indeterminate and neither response was a failure. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 12/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In cases where the subject received concomitant antifungal use with activity for any baseline Candida 
spp., the following algorithms were used for determining global response at EOIVT, EOT, and 2- and 6-
week follow-up visits. 
• 
• 
• 
If a subject took 2 or more days of antifungal medications (as identified by the clinical team) after 
the start of study medication until EOT for any reason, the subject was imputed to failure for all 
visits that occurred after the antifungal medication was taken. 
If a subject took 1 day of antifungal medication after the start of study treatment until EOT for the 
reason “lack of efficacy” the subject was similarly imputed to failure for all visits that occurred after 
the antifungal medication was taken. The clinical team determined whether the antifungal 
medication was used for “lack of efficacy”. 
In the follow-up period, if a subject took at least 1 day of antifungal medication for reason of “lack 
of efficacy”, the subject was imputed to failure for all visits that occurred after the antifungal 
medication was taken. Again, the clinical team determined whether the antifungal medication had 
been used for “lack of efficacy”. 
Assessor’s comments 
Primary and secondary outcomes are considered appropriate. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary analysis will be the evaluation of adverse events throughout the trial, laboratory tests, 
temperature, and physical examination. The set of subjects for this evaluation will be the Safety 
population, defined as all subjects with at least 1 dose of study medication. The following parameters 
will be summarised: rates of discontinuation, adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Safety 
data will be descriptively summarised. Descriptive statistics for categorical data will include frequencies 
and/or percentages.  
Secondary efficacy analyses will be assessed in the Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) population, 
defined as all subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug and who have microbiological 
evidence of Candida infection. The efficacy analysis will be an assessment of global response, 
conducted by frequencies and percentages of global response (success, failure). 
PP population: subjects in the MITT population, who also: 
o  Completed a minimum of 10 days of IV anidulafungin treatment, unless declared a clinical and/or 
microbiological failure. 
o  Received total antifungal treatment (IV only or IV plus oral) for a minimum duration of 14 days, 
unless declared a clinical and/or microbiological failure. 
o  Had not received more than 48 hours of systemic antifungal therapy (for treatment of current

Results 
Conduct of the study 
During the course of the study, 9 protocol amendments were implemented. Most significant 
amendments are listed here. Amendment 4 (2010) modified the entry criteria to allow enrolment of 
patients with Candida endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Amendment 8 (2015) added measurement of 
plasma concentrations of polysorbate 80 in the youngest age. Due to ongoing challenges in enrolling 
sufficient numbers of patients in the youngest age cohort (1 month to <2 years), Amendment 9 (2016) 
broadened the study population to align with regulatory agency feedback and to ensure that adequate 
numbers of appropriate patients were enrolled; in this latter amendment, patients at risk for Candida 
infection were permitted to be enrolled, in addition to the original target population, which was 
required to have confirmed Candida infection.

Assessor’s comments 
Most of the protocol deviations were related to the administration of the investigational product and 
concerned ‘lab not done’. Four subjects had received >48 hrs of antifungal therapy at baseline and a 
total of four subjects had received >1 day of systemic antifungal therapy either during treatment or 
follow up.  
When submitting the type II variation application, the MAH should discuss the use of concomitant 
antifungal treatment and discuss the reasons (if not lack of efficacy), and whether these subjects were 
considered failures or not (according to protocol of a subject took 2 or more days of antifungal 
medications this persons was imputed a failure). 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study initiated in 2009 and completed its last subject last visit in 2018. 
Over the 9-year study duration, 70 subjects were enrolled at 26 sites in 10 countries (Brazil, Canada, 
Greece, Italy, Republic of Korea, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom [UK], and United States 
[US]), and an additional 47 sites were supplied study drug but did not enrol any subjects. Study sites 
were established in 3 countries (France, Germany, and Portugal) that did not screen any subjects. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 16/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Of the 72 screened subjects, 4 subjects did not receive study drug and were not included in the safety 
population: 2 subjects were screen failures and 2 subjects were not included due to protocol violation 
(permitted window for prior antifungal therapy had elapsed). Of the 68 subjects in the safety 
population, 64 were included in the MITT population, ie, these subjects had received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had microbiological confirmation of Candida infection. Two subjects were excluded from 
the MITT population when final results of their screening cultures did not show growth of Candida spp., 
rather one culture was positive for Exophiala (Wangiella) dermatitidis and the other positive for 
Malssezia furfur. Two additional subjects were excluded from the MITT population as they were 
enrolled under Amendment 9 as being at high risk of IC and did not have microbiologically-confirmed 
ICC.

Within the 9 year period this trial ran for, 72 subjects were screened, 70 were randomised and 68 
subjects were treated. Of the 68 subjects who were treated and thus included in the safety population, 
four were removed from the mITT (primary analysis population) as they did not have confirmation of 
invasive Candida infection. Approximately half of patients who were screened were included in the per 
protocol population (n=40, 55.6%) suggesting a high rate of protocol deviations which is not surprising 
considering the patient population. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics are summarised by age group in Table 9. 
A large proportion of subjects had a present medical history indicative of significant underlying disease, 
including blood and lymphatic system disorders (n=42, 65.6%), infections and infestations (n=40, 
62.5%), gastrointestinal disorders (n=38, 59.4%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(n=36, 56.3%), metabolism and nutritional disorders (n=34, 53.1%), and neoplasms benign, 
malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (n=24, 37.5%). 
The most frequently reported risk factors for Candida infection were the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics and the use of a central venous catheter (50 [78.1%] subjects each) followed by total 
parenteral nutrition (29 [45.3%] subjects). Nearly a third of subjects overall were receiving 
chemotherapy, were neutropenic (n=21 each, 32.8%), or were receiving systemic steroids 
/immunosuppressives (n=20, 31.3%). Approximately 25% of subjects had either surgery or abdominal 
surgery as a risk factor. Additionally, 16 (25.0%) subjects had an intensive care unit length of stay of 
at least 4 days, and 11 (17.2%) subjects were mechanically ventilated. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 18/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Overall, the most commonly reported baseline pathogens identified in the 64 subjects in the MITT 
population included Candida albicans (25 [39.1%] subjects), Candida parapsilosis (17 [26.6%] 
subjects), and Candida tropicalis (9 [14.1%] subjects). Among subjects in the 1 month to <2 years 
and the 2 to <5 years age groups, Candida albicans was the most common baseline pathogen, while 
Candida parapsilosis was the most common baseline pathogen identified in the 5 to <18 years age 
group. The percent of subjects with Candida parapsilosis was lower in the 2 to <5 years age group 
(11.1%) compared to the other age groups: 31.3% and 33.3% in the 1 month to <2 years and the 5 
to <18 years age groups, respectively. 
Assessor’s comments 
EMA/916359/2019

Baseline criteria are reflective of a patient population at high risk of ICC, with substantial underlying 
morbidity, high rates of underlying malignancies, high rate of parenteral nutrition, and substantial use 
of concomitant medication. Thirty-three % of subjects were neutropenic; similar proportions of 
patients were receiving chemotherapy or were receiving systemic steroids /immunosuppressives. The 
most prevalent baseline pathogens were Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective with relevant secondary outcomes being Global 
Response at EOIVT and subsequent timepoints, relapse rates (2 & 6 weeks follow up), emerging 
infection rates (2 & 6 weeks follow up) and all-cause mortality. PK and exposure response are 
discussed elsewhere in this AR. Subgroup analyses included examination of response data in various 
categories, including age group, site of infection, Candida spp., and neutropenic status. 
Global response (combination of clinical and microbiological response as assessed by the Investigator) 
of success, failure, or indeterminate at the EOIVT and subsequent time points; 
An overall global response of success was observed in 45 of 64 (70.3%) subjects at EOIVT. Over 
90% of subjects in the MITT population overall and in each age group had Candida isolated from blood 
only.  
A sensitivity analysis of global response was performed excluding indeterminate and missing data. In 
this analysis, the success rate overall was 88.2% at EOIVT, 88.5% at EOT, 86.8% at the 2-week 
follow-up, and 81.1% at the 6-week follow-up. 
The Global response of success at EOIVT was 87.5 % (73.2, 95.8) in the PP population. 
Global response by age group 
Accounting for the small number of subjects, there were no notable trends with respect to global 
response between age groups. At EOT, the rate of success per age group was similar.

Assessor’s comments 
The global response rate at the end of IV treatment in the overall study population is 70.3% for the 
MITT population. Response rates are slightly higher in the per-protocol population as well as when 
missing data are disregarded. Response rates are roughly in line with rates seen in adults: in adults 
with ICC the success rate at EOIVT was 76% (88/116), at 2-week FU it was 65% (82/127), at 6-week 
FU it was 56% (71/127). 
Relapse rate and all-cause mortality 
Relapse of infection was reported in 3 subjects at the 6-week follow-up visit. No new Candida 
infections were reported for subjects at the 2- and 6-week follow-up visits.  
The overall all-cause mortality rate was 12.5% (8 subjects). While the observed mortality rates were 
varied between age cohorts, a meaningful interpretation is difficult due to the low number of subjects. 
Global Response by site of infection 
Blood Only 
Over 90% of subjects overall and in each age group had blood only infection. For blood only infections, 
overall global response success rates at the EOIVT and EOT visits were identical and observed in 42 
(71.2%) subjects. Across the 3 age groups, global response success rates at both visits was 9 of 14 
(64.3%) subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 13 of 16 (81.3%) subjects in the 2 to <5 
years age group, and 20 of 29 (69.0%) subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group. 
Overall, 12 (20.3%) subjects had an indeterminate response at both EOIVT and EOT, with relatively 
similar proportions across all 3 age groups. 
Among subjects for whom follow-up clinical and microbiological response assessments were available 
(n=59), an overall global response rate of success was observed in 42 (71.2%) subjects at the 2-week 
follow-up, and in 39 (66.1%) subjects at the 6-week follow-up. 
Blood and Other Sterile Sites 
Two subjects had infections in blood and other sterile sites. The overall global response success rate in 
this category at all study visits was 50.0%. One subject in the 2 to <5 years age group had reported 
source of infection as blood, eyes, and urinary tract. Though the Investigator assessed this subject as 
a clinical cure and microbiological eradication at EOIVT, the MAH assessed the global response as 
failure for all study visits because the Investigator discontinued subject’s study treatment to begin 
fluconazole IV for treatment of Candida albicans in the urine.  
Sterile Sites (Other than Blood Only)

For infections in sterile sites (other than blood only) the overall global response success rate at EOIVT 
and EOT was 66.7% (2 of 3 subjects) and 100% (3 of 3 subjects), respectively.

Assessor’s comments 
The failure rates are similar per species, whilst there is some variation in the indeterminates. However, 
numbers per strata are particularly low, no CIs are given and therefore no conclusions should be 
drawn. 
Global Response by neutropenic status 
The overall global response success rate at EOIVT was lower (63.6%) among subjects in the MITT 
population with laboratory-confirmed neutropenia (ANC ≤500 cells/mm3) at baseline (n=11) compared 
to those with ANC >500 cells/mm3.

Assessor’s comments 
Numbers are low (n=11) therefore data should be cautiously interpreted. The success rate is lower 
than in patients without neutropenia at baseline. Failure rates are not dissimilar however again, 
numbers are low. 
Clinical cure 
An overall clinical response of success (cure plus improvement) was observed in 50 of 64 (78.1%) 
subjects at EOIVT, and in 49 of 64 (76.6%) subjects at EOT. Across the 3 age groups, a clinical 
response rate of success ranged from 68.8 to 83.3% at both EOIVT and EOT. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 23/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Microbiological Response 
A microbiological response of success (eradication plus presumed eradication) was observed in 54 of 
64 (84.4%) subjects at EOIVT and 56 of 64 (87.5%) subjects at EOT. 
Assessor’s comments 
Clinical Cure and Microbiological response in the MITT is roughly in line with the Global Response.

Safety results 
Exposure 
Of the 72 screened subjects, 4 subjects did not receive study drug and were not included in the safety 
population: the safety population included 19 subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 19 
subjects in the 2 to <5 years age group and 30 subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group. 
The median duration of anidulafungin treatment for the overall safety population was 11 days. Of the 
68 subjects, 31 subjects were switched to receive treatment with fluconazole for a median duration of 
8 days. The total median duration of overall treatment (anidulafungin plus fluconazole) was 17 days. 
Adverse events 
There were 422 treatment emergent adverse events reported in 66 subjects. A total of 45 treatment-
related AEs were reported in 21 (30.9%) subjects. No notable trends were observed across the 3 age 
groups with regard to overall AEs.  
The 3 most commonly reported TEAEs were vomiting (n=16, 23.5%), diarrhoea (n=15, 22.1%), and 
pyrexia (n=13, 19.1%). The most commonly reported TEAEs reported in the Investigations SOC were 
increased ALT (n=7, 10.3%), increased AST (n=5, 7.4%), and transaminases increased (n=4, 5.9%).

Overall, 3 (15.8%) subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 4 (21.1%) subjects in the 2 to <5 
years age group, and 14 (46.7%) subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group experienced an 
anidulafungin-related TEAE. While the proportion of TEAEs was higher in the oldest age group; overall, 
no notable trends were identified between age groups. 
The majority of TEAEs were not considered treatment-related; a total of 45 treatment-related TEAEs 
(attributed to either anidulafungin or fluconazole) were reported in 21 (30.9%) subjects. 
The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs attributed to anidulafungin were diarrhoea (4 
subjects, 5.9%), vomiting, pyrexia, increased ALT, and increased AST (each reported by 3 subjects, 
4.4%). With the exception of diarrhoea, vomiting, and pyrexia, no other anidulafungin related TEAEs 
were reported by more than 1 subject within an age group. 
Overall, 3 (15.8%) subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 4 (21.1%) subjects in the 2 to <5 
years age group, and 14 (46.7%) subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group experienced an 
anidulafungin-related TEAE. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 27/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 7 (10.3%) subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs; 6 subjects discontinued 
anidulafungin and 1 subject discontinued fluconazole. Six TEAEs (diarrhea, vomiting, increased ALT, 
increased AST, generalised pruritus, and increased transaminases), experienced by 5 subjects, were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 28/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
All of these resolved with the exception of 1 event of increased transaminases; this event and other 
hepatobiliary AEs of interest are discussed below. Three TEAEs were considered severe and were also 
reported as SAEs. 
Adverse events of Special Interest 
The AEs of special interest for anidulafungin (hepatobiliary events, convulsions, QT prolongation/ 
Torsades de Pointes, anaphylaxis, infusion-related reactions, and anaesthetic exacerbation of infusion-
related reactions) were determined in accordance with the anidulafungin risk management plan and 
the safety review plan. These events were programmatically assessed based on pre-defined standard 
MedDRA queries (SMQs) and AE PTs (MedDRA, Version 20.1), and are summarised overall in Table 5.

Anaphylaxis 
Although the incidence of anaphylaxis appears artificially high, the search criteria, SMQs, broad and 
narrow (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema), and preferred terms (infusion-related reaction, hot flush, 
chills, dizziness, feeling hot, and hyperhidrosis), were used to identify cases potentially indicating 
anaphylaxis. Overall, 24 (35.3%) subjects experienced events potentially indicating anaphylaxis that 
were reported due to the wide search criteria used to identify all possible events. Following review of 
these events, no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis were reported for anidulafungin-treated subjects. 
Hepatobiliary Events 
The incidence of hepatobiliary disorder events is summarised in Table 31. Overall, 16 (23.5%) subjects 
experienced hepatic-related AEs (in the SOCs of Hepatobiliary disorders, Infections and infestations, 
Investigations, and Metabolism and nutrition disorders). The majority of events were mild to moderate 
in severity. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 29/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most events were reported in the Investigations SOC; study drug was permanently discontinued for 3 
subjects who experienced 4 hepatobiliary events (transaminases increased, ALT increased, and AST 
increased).  
Three subjects were reported to have severe hepatic-related AEs. Increased ALT and AST was 
assessed as severe for 1 subject in the 1 month to <2 year age group, and hyperbilirubinemia and 
transaminases increased were assessed as severe for 1 subject each in the 5 to <18 years age group. 
Of these, one hepatobiliary event (see below under SAEs) was reported as an SAE. 
Assessor’s comments  
Increased levels of hepatic enzymes have been observed in healthy volunteers. Significant hepatic 
dysfunction including hepatic failure has been observed in clinical trials in adult patients treated with 
anidulafungin. In the present study, 23.5% of paediatric patients experienced a hepatic related AE. 
Evidently it is a risk also observed in paediatric patients and here similar precautions will need to be 
taken. It is unclear whether the risk is similar to that in adults based upon the available data. 
Serious adverse events 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 30/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 30 (44.1%) subjects and 3 of these were considered 
related to study drug anidulafungin. 
•  A 17-year old Asian male with underlying history of acute lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple 
other reported conditions, including thrombocytopenia, experienced an SAE of gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage on Day 15 which was assessed as severe. The subject’s last dose of anidulafungin 
was on Day 12; fluconazole was administered until Day 16. The subject died due to sepsis on Day 
18. 
•  A 5-year old male of other race, was treated with anidulafungin from Day 1 to 10, and 
experienced an AE of severe transaminases increased which was assessed as an SAE. On Day 1, 
the subject experienced an SAE of severe medulloblastoma disease progression, with documented 
tumour progression on MRI. During enrolment, multiple AEs were reported, including, among 
others: bradycardia (Days 2 and 4), pyrexia (Day 2 to 10), tachypnoea and respiratory disorder 
(Day 3 to 4); scrotal oedema (Day 5 onward), penile oedema (Day 7 onward), and dyspnoea (Day 
8 to 10, following a tracheostomy on Day 6 to replace endotracheal intubation from Day -2). On 
Day 10, the subject developed severe transaminases increased, which was also considered an 
SAE and was assessed by the Investigator as related to anidulafungin; this event resulted in 
permanent discontinuation of study drug. Other AEs reported as of Day 10 included pupil fixed, 
areflexia, and epistaxis. The subject died on Day 12. The cause of death, as assessed by the 
Investigator, was attributed to medulloblastoma disease progression.  
•  A 3-month old white female with a prior history of gastrointestinal obstruction, experienced an 
SAE of diarrhoea (Day 1), which was assessed as severe and resulted in discontinuation of study 
drug. The event was reported as resolved on Day 6. No other SAEs were assessed as related to 
either anidulafungin or fluconazole treatment. The majority of SAEs reported had an outcome of 
recovered/resolved. 
Deaths 
A total of 10 death cases were reported to the MAH; 1 occurred during the active treatment phase, 7 
occurred during the post-treatment (follow-up) phase, and 2 occurred post-treatment outside of the 
safety reporting period (after the 6-week follow-up visit). For the 8 deaths that occurred during the 
study reporting period, Investigators specified the cause of death on the CRF as related to one of the 
following: (1) death from infection under study; (2) death unrelated to infection under study, but 
infection was still current; or (3) death unrelated to infection under study and no evidence of infection 
at time of death.  
None of the deaths were assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug. One death was 
assessed by the Investigator to be related to the infection under study: 
•  A 7-year old Asian male, discontinued anidulafungin after 1 dose due to a treatment-related AE of 
pruritus generalised. The subject then started IV fluconazole and later micafungin; the subject 
died of septic shock on Day 20. 
The remaining 7 deaths were assessed as related to other conditions: intracranial haemorrhage, 
sepsis/septic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, progression of 
medulloblastoma, and multi-organ failure (metachromatic leukodystrophy. 
In the 2 subjects with death related to sepsis/septic shock, the Investigators assessed the deaths as 
unrelated to the infection under study, but infection was still current. 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 31/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  A 3-year old male of other race died of septic shock on Day 1. Septic shock is noted as present 
medical history at baseline. The causality of death in the CRF is noted as "Other illness-previous 
septic shock due to neutropenia, which was caused by previous chemotherapy treatment."  
•  A 17-year old Asian male, died of sepsis (on Day 18; causality was reported as being related to 
acute lymphocytic leukaemia). The subject's baseline blood culture was positive for Candida 
tropicalis; however, all subsequent blood cultures were negative for Candida spp. On Day 16, a 
blood culture was positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This single arm prospective set out to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK of anidulafungin in children 1 
month to <18 years of age with ICC. Although the study would have benefitted from a control arm, in 
general the methods are considered appropriate. 
Subjects received anidulafungin IV treatment with a 3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Study Day 1 followed 
by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance dose daily thereafter IV for a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 35 
days. There was an option to switch to oral treatment with fluconazole (6 to 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 
800 mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV treatment. 
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of anidulafungin in children has only partially been characterised. 
Results of the awaited population pharmacokinetic modelling should be presented and assessed, before 
conclusions on the pharmacokinetics can be drawn.  
Inclusion criteria were significantly altered during the course of the study however as only 2 subjects 
were recruited under the new inclusion criteria, i.e. being at high risk for ICC without microbiologically 
confirmed ICC, the impact on the conclusions of this study is considered to be minimal. 
Over a 9-year period, 72 patients were screened, 70 were randomised and 68 were treated. Of these, 
19 subjects were in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 19 subjects in the 2 to <5 years age group 
and 30 subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group.  
The baseline characteristics of subjects were reflective of a patient population at high risk of ICC with 
high rates of central catheter and broad spectrum antibiotic use, total parenteral nutrition, underlying 
malignancy, and chemotherapy. The most commonly reported baseline pathogens in the MITT 
population included Candida albicans (39.1%), Candida parapsilosis (26.6%), and Candida tropicalis 
(14.1%). 
The overall global response success rates in the MITT population were 70.3% (95% CI: 57.6, 81.1) 
at EOIVT. Success rates were slightly higher in the PP population. Response rates are roughly in line 
with rates seen in adults: in adults with ICC the success rate at EOIVT was 76% (88/116), at 2-week 
FU it was 65% (82/127), at 6-week FU it was 56% (71/127). 
As over 90% of subjects in the MITT population had Candida isolated from blood only, global response 
rates in subjects with candidaemia (blood-only infections) were similar to the overall population at all 
time points. Success rates at EOIVT were slightly lower (63.6%) in patients with neutropenia at 
baseline than patients without neutropenia at baseline, however this is based upon 11 subjects only.  
The median duration of anidulafungin treatment for the overall safety population was 11 days. Of the 
68 subjects, 31 subjects were switched to receive treatment with fluconazole for a median duration of 
8 days. The total median duration of overall treatment (anidulafungin plus fluconazole) was 17 days. 
The 3 most commonly reported TEAEs were vomiting (n=16, 23.5%), diarrhoea (n=15, 22.1%), and 
pyrexia (n=13, 19.1%). Increased ALT and increased AST was reported by 10.3% (n=7) and 7.4% 
EMA/916359/2019  
Page 32/33 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(n=5) of subjects respectively. A total of 7 (10.3%) subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs. 
Transaminases increased was reported by 5.9% (n=4) of subjects. The most commonly reported 
treatment-related TEAEs attributed to anidulafungin were diarrhoea (4 subjects, 5.9%), vomiting, 
pyrexia, increased ALT, and increased AST (each reported by 3 subjects, 4.4%). In adults too most 
commonly reported adverse drug reactions include gastrointestinal adverse events including diarrhoea 
and vomiting. The study was too small to inform adverse reactions occuring less frequently than 
roughly 1 in 10 paediatric subjects. There were no clear age-related patterns in the safety data 
however numbers in different age strata are low. 
As seen in the adult patient population, a relatively high proportion of subjects reported hepatic related 
AEs (23.5%) in this paediatric study. It is unclear whether the risk is similar to that in adults based 
upon the available data, however evidently similar precautions will need to be taken in paediatric 
patients. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 30 (44.1%) subjects. There were 3 SAEs considered 
related to study drug anidulafungin (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic enzymes increased, 
diarrhoea); there were 10 deaths of which none were considered related to treatment and one was 
considered related to ICC. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall the data provided by study A8851008 suggests that the efficacy and safety in paediatric 
patients aged 1 month to 18 years with invasive candidiasis/candidaemia is largely in line with the 
efficacy and safety profile seen in adults. However data are limited and pharmacokinetics are not yet 
fully characterised, therefore this assessment is only preliminary. The submission of a Type II variation 
application in 2019 to update the Product Information as supported by the A8851008 CSR and the final 
PMAR for the aforementioned population PK/PD analysis is awaited.  
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data regarding paediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years with invasive 
candidiasis/candidaemia, the MAH should either submit a variation application in accordance with 
Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This 
should be provided by end of February 2019.

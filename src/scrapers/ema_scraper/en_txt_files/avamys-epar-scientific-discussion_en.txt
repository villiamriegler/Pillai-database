SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
Allergic rhinitis (AR) in its seasonal and perennial form is a common allergic condition. It is clinically 
defined as a symptomatic disorder of the nose induced by IgE-mediated inflammation after allergen 
exposure to the mucous membranes of the nose. Symptoms of AR include rhinorrhoea, nasal 
obstruction, nasal itching and sneezing, accompanied frequently by eye symptoms. 
Rhinopathies  can  be  classified  as  being  structural,  infectious,  allergic,  or  non-allergic.  AR,  an 
inflammatory  condition  of  the  nasal  mucosa  mediated  by  an  IgE-associated  response  to  indoor  and 
outdoor  environmental  allergens,  has  traditionally  been  classified  as  being  seasonal  (SAR)  or 
perennial  (PAR),  depending  on  whether  an  individual  is  sensitized  to  cyclic  pollens  or  year  round 
allergens, such as dust mites, pets, cockroaches, and moulds.  
The diagnosis of AR can be made presumptively based on the types of symptoms and the history of 
allergen  triggers.  The  diagnosis  is  further  supported  by  documentation  of  specific  IgE  reactivity 
through  determination  of  allergen  sensitivity  by  using  skin  prick  testing  or  in  vitro  specific  IgE 
determination. These procedures can help detect specific allergic sensitivities and provide information 
for directing environmental control interventions. 
According  to  data  supplied  from  the  applicant  the  prevalence  of  allergic  rhinitis  is  30%  of  US 
population  and  similar  in  Europe;  13-19%  among  adolescents  (13-14  years  olds)  and  5-10%  for 
children 6-7 years old. Higher figures have been reported in some countries, in which 40% of children 
were found to have symptoms compatible with allergic rhinitis. 
The goal of allergic rhinitis therapy is to manage both the acute and chronic manifestations of the 
disease by minimizing the associated symptoms and improving quality of life.  To achieve this, current 
treatment recommendations include allergen avoidance, immunotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy.  
Avoidance is difficult to achieve for the most common allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites).  
Immunotherapy is an effective chronic therapy in some patients but it is time-consuming, 
inconvenient, and has potential serious adverse effects (such as large local reactions and anaphylaxis). 
Current pharmacotherapy options include intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents and decongestants.  Local (intranasal) glucocorticoids are considered drugs of 
choice in symptomatic treatment of AR. Their well-known, class-typical anti-inflammatory properties 
enable efficacious control of symptoms of AR in the majority of patients treated. 
Avamys nasal spray suspension (27.5 micrograms per spray) contains fluticasone furoate (FF) as 
active substance. Fluticasone furoate (GW685698X) is a new corticosteroid developed by 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) presented as an aqueous suspension in a novel side-actuated nasal spray 
delivery system claimed for once daily treatment for topical use in relieving symptoms of seasonal 
(SAR) and perennial (PAR) allergic rhinitis. 
This application concerns a centralised procedure, according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, 
“optional scope” Article 3(2)(a) – new active substance. This application is submitted in accordance 
with the Article 8(3) in Directive 2001/83/EC – i.e. dossier with administrative, quality, preclinical 
and clinical data for a new active substance. The application is a full application.

2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Composition 
Avamys is a multidose preserved aqueous nasal spray suspension. Each spray delivers 27.5microgram 
of the active substance fluticasone furoate to the patient (ex device).  
Other ingredients include dispersible cellulose (as suspending agent), glucose (as a tonicity-adjusting 
agent),  Polysorbate  80  (as  a  surfactant),  benzalkonium  chloride  solution  and  disodium  edetate  (as 
preservatives) and purified water. 
The  suspension  is  contained  in  an  amber  glass  bottle  fitted  with  a  metering  atomising  spray  pump.  
The  bottle  is  enclosed  within  an  outer  plastic  device  with  a  dose  indicator  window,  a  side-actuated 
lever and a nozzle, which is protected by a lid containing a stopper.  
The product is provided in three pack sizes to deliver a minimum of 30, 60 or 120 sprays respectively. 
Active Substance 
Fluticasone furoate is a tetracyclic steroidal molecule. It contains 9 sterogenic centres and is the 
isomer with the 6S, 8S, 9R, 10S, 11S, 13S, 14S, 16R, 17R configuration. It is a neutral molecule and 
has no acidic or basic centres. It is non-hygroscopic, practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble 
in  acetone,  dimethylsulphoxide  and  ethanol.  The  proof  of  chemical  structure  was  achieved  by 
elemental, spectroscopic and X-Ray diffraction analysis. Fluticasone furoate exists in 3 polymorphic 
forms; Form 1 is thermodynamically stable at room temperature. It is a crystalline powder, which may 
exist in an acicular or tetragonal pyramid crystal form.  The latter is preferred due to its enhanced flow 
properties.  
•  Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  synthesised  with  a  six  step  synthetic  process  using  flumethasone  as  the 
steroidal starting material followed by a particle size reduction step.  The route of synthesis has four 
major  stages,  including  preparation  of  a  key  intermediate  from  flumethasone,  preparation  of 
intermediate  grade  fluticasone  furoate,  preparation  of  non-micronised  fluticasone  furoate  and  finally 
micronisation  of  fluticasone  furoate.  The  synthetic  process  for  non-micronised  fluticasone  furoate 
delivers only Form 1 material with a tetragonal bipyramidal crystal form.  This material has good flow 
properties and is readily micronised. 
For the development and validation of the manufacturing process the principles described in the ICH 
Q8 and Q9 guidelines have been taken into account. Several studies have been performed to identify 
the  critical  quality  attributes  of  the  active  substance  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  safety  and 
efficacy of the finished product, to gain a better understanding of the process and develop a Design 
Space for the manufacturing process. In addition appropriate control strategies (including PAT) have 
been developed to monitor the critical process parameters. 
The  impurity  profile  of  the  active  substance  has  been  extensively  investigated  and  meets  the  ICH 
requirements. All potential impurities have been identified and characterised. All solvents used in the 
manufacture of the active substance are controlled in compliance with ICH guidelines. 
•  Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description,  identification  (IR),  solid  state  form 
(IR), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl Fischer), residue 
on ignition (IR) and particle size distribution (Laser Diffraction). 
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  from  3  production  scale  batches  manufactured  according  to 
the synthetic process intended for marketing and 3 production scale batches manufactured according 
to a non-optimised process, which was used for stability studies. Batch analysis data are also presented 
for 15 batches used in non-clinical and clinical studies. The batch analysis data presented confirm that 
the proposed process can reproducibly produce a product that complies with the set specifications.

•  Stability 
Twenty-four months stability data at the long-term storage condition of 30°C/65% RH and 6 months 
data  at  the  accelerated  storage  condition  of  40°C/75%  RH  have  been  presented  for  three  batches  of 
micronised fluticasone furoate packaged in containers representing those proposed for use in routine 
production. 
The parameters tested were the same as at release except for identification, residual solvents and 
residue on ignition. The analytical methods used were appropriately validated and have been shown to 
be stability indicating. The stability data demonstrate that the active substance has a very good 
stability profile.  All results were within the predefined specifications.  
Results from photostability studies performed in accordance with the ICH requirements show that the 
unprotected  active  substance  is  sensitive  to  light  and  therefore  it  is  recommended  that  it  should  be 
protected from it. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the Pharmaceutical Development was to develop a product that would provide a consistent 
dose to the patient throughout its use and minimise  the potential  for inhalation to the lungs. A risk-
based approach has been applied, where appropriate, throughout the development using the principles 
described in the ICH Q8 and Q9 guidelines. Methodologies such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis 
(FMEA),  Relationship  Matrices  and  Design  of  Experiments  have  been  employed  to  identify  and 
manage  the  critical  to  quality  attributes  of  the  process  and  the  product  and  to  improve  the  overall 
product and process understanding.  
The  active  substance  has  been  formulated  as  an  aqueous  suspension,  because  the  results  of 
pharmacokinetic studies showed that a suspension formulation results in less systemic exposure than 
other formulations and was therefore appropriate for topical delivery to the nasal mucosa. The active 
substance is incorporated into the finished product in a micronised form. The formulation includes a 
suspending  agent  (dispersible  cellulose)  to  ensure  that  the  active  substance  remains  homogeneously 
distributed and to prevent variation in the droplet size distribution of the finished product. A tonicity 
adjusting agent (glucose) and a broad spectrum preservative system (benzalkonium chloride disodium 
edetate) are also included. The use of benzalkonium chloride as a preservative has been fully justified 
on the basis that it is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent and is further supported by its use in other 
commercially available nasal formulations. All excipients used in the product are of non-animal origin 
and comply with their corresponding European Pharmacopoeia monographs. 
The container closure system comprises of an inner container within an outer device. The outer device 
is a side-actuated plastic delivery system with a lever, a dose indicator window and a lid containing a 
stopper. The bottle is not intended to be accessible to the patient from the assembled container closure 
system.  Mechanically  and  ergonomically  the  device  has  been  designed  to  facilitate  treatment  of 
patients  2  years  and  older,  with  self-administration  from  7  years.  The  container  closure  system  was 
designed  to  assure  consistent  dosing.    The  pump  has  been  chosen  so  as  to  provide  consistent  and 
reliable spray weight delivery. The nozzle delivers a consistent droplet size distribution in the spray 
and the pack retains a primed state during extended periods of non-use.  The same basic design has 
been used throughout clinical trials and stability testing. 
Extensive  pharmaceutical  development  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  finished  product  in 
compliance  with  the  “Guideline  on  the  Pharmaceutical  Quality  of  Inhalation  and  Nasal  Products”.  
These include priming and repriming tests, in use studies, effect of orientation during use, minimum 
fill justification, testing to exhaustion, temperature cycling and robustness.  
All the plastic materials of the pump and nozzle comply with the European Directive, 2002/72/EC, on 
plastics for food contact and meet composition requirements of Ph.Eur. The extractable and leachable 
profile of the finished product has been satisfactorily investigated. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  for  these  kind  of  formulations  and  consists  of  the 
following steps: suspension manufacture, filling and assembly 
©EMEA 2008 
3/51 
 
 
 
 
All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
It has been demonstrated that the process is reproducible and provides a product that complies with the 
in-process and finished product specifications. 
•  Product Specification 
The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  description, 
identity  (IR),  assay  (HPLC),  preservative  content  (potentiometric  titration,  HPLC),  pH,  microbial 
limits, delivered dose uniformity (HPLC) , contents weight, number of sprays, droplet size distribution 
(laser diffraction) and impurities (HPLC).  
The  proposed  specification  encompasses  the  requirements  of  the  “Guideline  on  the  pharmaceutical 
quality  of  inhalation  and  nasal  products”  and  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  for  nasal  products.  All  tests 
included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Batch analysis data are presented for the primary stability and clinical batches. All batches met the test 
limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The stability studies have been performed in accordance with the ICH guidelines and the requirements 
of  described  in  the  “Guideline  on  the  pharmaceutical  quality  of  inhalation  and  nasal  products”.  
Stability data have been presented for 3 primary stability batches. The composition, size and volume 
of the container closure system were the same as that proposed for commercial production. Samples 
have been stored for up to 24 months at 30ºC/65%RH and for up to 6 months at 40ºC /75% RH.   
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, impurities, benzalkonium chloride and EDTA content, 
preservative efficacy, microbial limit testing, leachables content, pH, uniformity of delivered dose and 
droplet size and weight loss. The analytical methods used in most cases were the same as those used 
for release testing and are stability indicating. 
Data from stressed stability studies have also been presented for one batch each of the 30, 60 and 120 
presentations,  stored  at  50°C/ambient  RH  for  up  to  three  months,  up  to  12  months  at  5°C/  ambient 
humidity and seven days storage in a light cabinet. In addition, data are presented from one batch of 
each of the 120 and 30 spray packs stored under temperature cycling conditions (5ºC/40ºC) for up to 
one month. The results of stressed stability studies demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of 
the finished product in all storage conditions. 
In all cases the stability results provided were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Avamys is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from 
EU and ICH requirements. 
The active substance is stable, well characterised and documented. The excipients are commonly used 
in  these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph. Eur.  requirements.  The  applicant  has performed 
extensive development studies both for the active substance and the finished product and has applied, 
where appropriate, the principles described in ICH Q8 and Q9 guidelines The device component of the 
finished  product  has  been  evaluated  as  an  integral  part  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  manufacture, 
analytical procedures and specifications set for the container closure system and have been adequately 
described.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  is  a  standard  process  that  has  been 
adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is 
chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion  there  were  some  outstanding  minor  quality  issues,  which  had  no 
impact  on  the  benefit/risk  profile.  The  applicant  committed  to  provide  the  necessary  information  as 
follow-up  measures  within  an  agreed  timeframe,  and  to  submit  variations  if  required  following  the 
evaluation of this additional information.

Introduction 
studies,  a  number  of  pharmacokinetic 
studies  commissioned  by 
Safety  pharmacology 
GlaxoSmithKline  at  contract  research  organisations,  and  all  pivotal  toxicity  studies  (including  the 
toxicokinetic arm of each study) were carried out in full compliance with Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) regulations. However for one toxicology study a GLP non-compliance was found (at the time 
of adoption of the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues), following which the CHMP requested a GLP 
inspection.  All  other  studies  were  conducted  in  line  with  the  company’s  Standard  Operating 
Procedures and Policies, and in general accordance with the principles of GLP.  
Pharmacology 
Topical glucocorticoids interact with many of the inflammatory pathways, and there is a large body of 
clinical evidence to support their use in rhinitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  
Fluticasone furoate is a new glucocorticoid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone furoate 
is not a salt or prodrug; the entire molecule is required for pharmacological activity.   
The  17-α  furoate  ester  is  metabolically  stable.  Fluticasone  furoate  is  not  metabolised  to  fluticasone, 
i.e. the furoate ester is an integral part of the respective medicinal entity and remains covalently bound 
to the fluticasone steroid backbone. 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
In Vitro  
In vitro assays (both human and rat cell lines) of glucocorticoid receptor-induced transrepression and 
transactivation  and  also  assays  of  cytokine  release, revealed  that  fluticasone  furoate  (FF)  has  a  very 
high  binding  affinity  equivalent  to  that  observed  with  fluticasone  propionate  (FP)  and  greater  than 
other  inhaled  corticosteroids.  Fluticasone  furoate  is  a  very  potent  glucocorticoid  agonist  with 
comparable or superior activity to the clinical standards fluticasone propionate (FP) and mometasone 
furoate  (Table  1).  The  affinity  of  FF,  FP  and  mometasone  for  a  number  of  associated  receptors 
including  androgen  receptor  (AR),  oestrogen  receptor,  mineralocorticoid  receptor  (MR)  and 
progesterone receptor (PR) were investigated and are outlined in Table 1. Fluticasone furoate (FF) has 
properties  at  the  steroid  nuclear  receptors  which  are  broadly  similar  to  FP  with  high  potency  and 
intrinsic  efficacy  at  the  glucocorticoid  receptor,  low  intrinsic  efficacy  on  MR  agonist  activity,  AR 
affinity, PR agonist activity but no activity at the oestrogen receptors. 
Fluticasone furoate potently suppressed the activation of NFκB and AP-1 and activated glucocorticoid 
response  element  (GRE),  which  are  associated  with  the  agonism  of  glucocorticoid  receptor. 
Furthermore, FF increased the transactivation of MMTV (murine-mammary-tumour virus) and GRE-
mediated TAT (tyrosine aminotransferase) induction and inhibited the release of IL-8 from bronchial 
epithelial cells exposed to TNF-α. The NFκB pathway is known to play a key role in the synthesis of a 
wide  number  of  inflammatory  cytokines.  Both  FF  and  FP  inhibit  NFκB  mediated  IL-1β  stimulated 
release  of  IL-6,  IL-8  and  GM-CSF,  however  FF  continued  to  demonstrate  a  more  potent  inhibition 
over  a  prolonged  period  of  time  (16  hours)  in  comparison  to  FP.  Furthermore,  FF  demonstrated 
significant  suppression  of  TNF-α  release  to  a  greater  degree  than  a  number  of  other  clinically  used 
inhaled corticosteroids.  
Both FF and FP exposure to bronchial epithelial cells resulted in the equivalent induced expression of 
SLPI (secretory leuko-proteinase inhibitor) and MKP-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 
1),  with  expression  maintained  for  16  hours  following  exposure  to  FF.  The  prolonged  duration  of 
action of FF coincided with the nuclear retention of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) for at least 24 hours 
following  exposure.  Together  with  the  prolonged  nuclear  retention,  FF  also  induced  a  faster  and 
greater  degree  of  nuclear  translocation  of  the  GR  than  fluticasone  propionate  and  dexamethasone  at 
concentrations  close  to  the  normal  pharmacological  range  (10  nM).  FF  also  showed  significant 
selectivity with respect to a number of steroid hormone receptors (Table 1).  
©EMEA 2008 
5/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary metabolite GW694301X showed significantly less activity (6000-fold) in comparison to 
FF when tested in a number of GR dependent assays (including NFκB, AP-1 and GRE).    
Glucocorticoids have previously demonstrated their ability to protect and improve barrier function and 
protect bronchial epithelial  monolayers from protease damage  and cell detachment which  have been 
associated with lung inflammatory diseases such as asthma.  
In assays of protease-induced cell damage and mechanically induced cell damage, FF demonstrated a 
similar  protective  effect  to  that  of  other  glucocorticoids  in  protecting  against  neutrophil  elastase 
damage,  reduced  the  decrease  in  epithelial  monolayer  permeability  and  improved  epithelial  layer 
integrity following mechanical damage. The mechanism of these protective effects has as yet not fully 
been elucidated. The rank order of potency for FF and the other glucocorticoids studied, irrespective 
of  the  protective  effect  studied  (elastase  wounding,  epithelial  permeability  or  mechanical  wound 
studies) was similar. FF always demonstrated a similar or greater degree of protection, FF >FP ≥MF 
>Budesonide >Dexamethasone >BMP.

Investigation of tissue binding in an epithelial cell monolayer revealed that the association of FF was 
greater (approximately 2-fold) than for FP and the rate of flux from the apical to basolateral surface of 
cells was slower for FF than for FP. FF was also found to bind more avidly to a suspension of whole 
lung tissue. These results indicate that FF would be retained in the lungs and potentially nasal tissue 
for longer than FP and subsequently result in a longer duration of action.  
In Vivo 
The  anti-inflammatory  properties  of  FF  were  investigated  in  two  unrelated  animal  models  of 
inflammation  with  differing  immunology.  FF  and  FP  administered  intratracheally  at  doses  <100µg, 
completely  and  dose  dependently  inhibited  lung  eosinophilia  in  the  Brown  Norway  rat  (model  of

characteristic eosinophil inflammation of the lung). FF more potently inhibited lung eosinophilia than 
FP at the lowest doses (10µg and 30µg). FF and FP equally inhibited skin inflammation after topical 
administration of oxazolone in a Delayed Type Hypersensitivity model of ear inflammation in rats (SH 
2002/00044/00).  Oxazolone  induced  sensitization  (ear  swelling)  in  BALB/c  mice  was  potently  and 
dose dependently inhibited by the administration of FF to the treated ear, with slight systemic effects 
observed through reduced swelling observed in the untreated ear (SH2003/0031/00).  
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Secondary pharmacodynamics of FF assessed by using rat thymus involution model as an index of the 
systemic  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  glucocorticoids,  showed  that  FF  has  glucocorticoid  systemic 
activity.  Three  daily  intratracheal  doses  of  100  µg  FF  induced  significantly  smaller  reduction  in 
thymus weight (p = 0.004) when compared to an equivalent dose of FP (67% of thymus weight with 
FF vs. 78% reduction with FP).

Results 
No effect on any of the action potential parameters in fibres 
treated with FF at concentrations up to 2200 pg/ml (100 
times the expected human unbound plasma level). 
 Note: concentration 2200 pg/ml is an equivalent of baseline 
concentration of 8800 pg/ml after taking into account an 
anticipated loss of test material in the perfusion apparatus of 
about 75%.  
Treatment with FF was associated with a transient decrease 
in blood pressure and a small transient increase in heart rate. 
These effects were similar to those seen following vehicle 
treatment. AUC0-∞: 49.3 h·ng/ml, Cmax: 41.7 ng/ml   
No additional effects above those seen with vehicle 
treatment were observed following treatment wit FF.

(WD2002/00077/00) 
0, 4, 10 mg/kg 
(s.c.) 
No overt pharmacodynamic effects at the doses tested over 
the 48 hour monitoring period. Delayed adverse effects 
(muscle wasting and polyuria) were believed to be the result 
of prolonged release of FF from the subcutaneous depot into 
the systemic circulation.     
There  were  no  safety  concerns  based  on  safety  pharmacology  studies.  Changes  in  cardiovascular 
parameters  were  associated  with  the  vehicle  or  have  previously  been  associated  with  this  class  of 
compound in the rat, and therefore there is no cause for concern. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not perform pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies because there are no known 
additive  pharmacological  interactions  of  glucocorticoid  agonists  such  as  FF.  The  glucocorticoid 
antagonists,  having  a  theoretical  potential  of  reducing  agonist  activity  of  FF,  are  not  in  clinical  use. 
The justification was acceptable to CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Since  much  of  an  intranasal  dose  is  swallowed,  the  oral  route  of  drug  administration  was  used  as  a 
surrogate for this part of the dose during non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies. The intravenous route 
of drug administration was used as a surrogate for material reaching the systemic circulation following 
absorption from the nasal cavity. 
•  Methods of analysis 
Seven  validated  analytical  methods  were  used  in  determining  the  pharmacokinetics  of  FF.  These 
methods  utilized  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometric  detection  (LC-MS/MS). 
Methods were developed and validated in mouse plasma, rat plasma, rabbit plasma and dog plasma. 
The lower limit of quantification was 10 pg/ml (rabbit) or 20 pg/ml (other species) with upper limit 
being  100-  to  200-fold  higher.  Radiolabelled  metabolite  profiles  from  in  vitro  samples  and  from 
extracts of samples obtained from mice, rats, dogs and humans were studied using HPLC with either 
on-line or off-line radiochemical detection. Studies to identify the metabolites of these samples were 
performed  using  1H-NMR,  LC-MS  and  LC-MS/MS.  Radio-chromatographic  profiles  in  selected 
extracts  of  human  plasma  samples  were  obtained  using  accelerator  mass  spectrometric  technique 
(AMS) for radio-determination due to the low levels of radioactivity present in these samples. 
•  Absorption 
limited  bioavailability  following  oral 
Animal  studies  demonstrated  rapid  absorption  with 
administration. After intravenous administration there was a high exposure to drug related material at 
the  later  time  points,  indicating  a  high  systemic  exposure  to  circulating  metabolites.  The  oral 
bioavailability of FF was higher in the bile duct-cannulised rat and dog (30% and 19% respectively) 
based  on  the  recovery  of  total  drug-related  material in  bile  and  urine,  indicating  extensive  first  pass 
metabolism. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in non-clinical studies of FF (single dose) are presented in

Subcutaneous  administration  of  FF  to  rat  and  dog  showed  significant  prolongation  of  half-life  (25 
hours and 160 hours in rat and dog respectively), related to subcutaneous drug deposit. 
Repeat dose pharmacokinetic data for FF were obtained from multiple dose studies performed in the 
mouse,  rat,  rabbit  and  dog  after  inhaled  and  intranasal  administration.  As  the  inhaled  route  of 
administration is less relevant to the proposed method of Avamys administration, these are considered 
as  supportive  data  (showing  low  systemic  absorption  after  inhaled  administration.  Multiple  dose 
pharmacokinetics of FF using intranasal route of administration were obtained from  a  multiple dose 
(13 or 26 week, once or twice daily) toxicology study to assess nasal irritancy and systemic toxicity of 
FF in nasal suspension following administration to the dog. Results of the pharmacokinetic part of this 
study are presented in the table below: 
Table 5 
Absorption data of FF after multiple intranasal administration to dogs (Source: 
Module 4.2.3.2, Report WD2004/01625/00) 
The  absorption  phase  of  FF  is  documented  sufficiently.  The  results  of  studies  using  the  methods  of 
administration  close  to  the  proposed  mode  of  administration  to  humans  (oral,  inhaled,  intranasal) 
indicate  that  FF  has  very  low  systemic  bioavailability.  The  comparison  of  animal  pharmacokinetic 
data  obtained  following  administration  of  doses  more  than  10-fold  higher  than  clinical  with  clinical 
pharmacokinetic data obtained after administration of FF as recommended for Avamys, suggests that 
the  probability  of  occurrence  of  significant  systemic  absorption  followed  by  systemic  activity  of 
intranasal FF at dosage of 110 µg/day is minimal.  
•  Distribution 
FF was found to be highly protein bound in all species at > 98%, with no notable binding or retention 
in melanin containing tissues. Furthermore, FF has a high plasma clearance equivalent to or exceeding 
the hepatic blood flow in the species tested. This indicates, in conjunction with the high concentrations 
of circulating metabolites relative to parent compound, that FF is cleared extensively by metabolism, 
with a large volume of distribution and a high tissue uptake.  
Data  obtained  from  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  distribution  studies  did  not  suggest  any  important  risk 
connected with nasal use of FF related to its distribution characteristics. 
•  Metabolism 
The  overall  metabolic  profile  of  FF  was  considered  essentially  similar  in  all  species  tested.  FF  was 
determined  to  be  primarily  metabolised  via  the  CYP3A4  enzyme.  In  all  species  tested  the  principal 
metabolism was the hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate group to form GW694301X (M10). 
The metabolism of FF in human liver microsomes was almost completely inhibited by ketoconazole. 
Thus,  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  such  as  ketoconazole  could  potentially  increase  the  systemic 
exposure to FF. FF is not expected to interfere with the metabolism of other compounds via this route. 
FF was found to be a substrate of two membrane transporters including P-glycoprotein and OATP1B1, 
however it is not expected to interfere with transport of other compounds.

•  Excretion 
The  rates  and  route  of  excretion  of  drug  related  material  were  similar  in  rats,  dogs  (and  humans) 
following  either  intravenous  or  oral  administration.  Following  i.v  administration  to  male  dogs 
(0.1mg/kg)  and  rats  (1mg/kg),  the  primary  route  of  excretion  was  via  the  faeces  (81.1%  (dog)  and 
86.4% (rat) of the dose). Urinary elimination was only a minor route of elimination (approx. 4% (dog) 
and 1.7% (rat)). Elimination was initially rapid with >85% recovered during the first 24 hours from the 
rat and 80% being recovered within the first 48 hours from the dog. Total radioactivity recovered was 
86%  (after  96  hours)  and  91.2%  (after  48  hours)  of  the  administered  dose  from  the  dog  and  rat, 
respectively.  
Studies  in  bile  duct  cannulated  rats  or  dogs  following  single  intravenous  administration  of  FF 
indicated  that  the  majority  of  the  dose  excreted  in  the  faeces  was  secreted  via  the  bile.  In  these 
animals, a small amount (< 5%) was excreted in the faeces indicating that there was some secretion 
directly into the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT).   
Results  following  oral  administration  indicate  that  either  FF  was  not  absorbed  from  the  GIT  or 
absorbed and eliminated via the bile back into the GIT. 
Following  subcutaneous  administration  the  majority  was  excreted  within  the  first  72  hours  post 
administration.  This  delay  in  excretion  indicates  formation  of  a  depot  with  release  of  drug  over  a 
sustained  period,  which  has  been  supported  by  pharmacokinetic  data,  where  plasma  levels  are 
sustained over 168 hours. Furthermore, a considerable amount of drug related material was retained in 
the carcass (5-43%) up to 168 hours post-dose. 
Irrespective  of  the  route  of  administration  there  were  no  qualitative  differences  with  respect  to 
excretion between males and females, although there are possible slight quantitative differences.

•  Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  FF  was  administered  by  oral, 
intravenous and inhalation route.  
The results of single dose studies in mice and rats (high doses of FF administered orally, intravenously 
or  by  inhalation,  producing  measurable  systemic  exposure)  showed  the  effects  typical  for  excess  of 
glucocorticoids i.e. reduction of body weight and lymphoid depletion. 
The table below shows a summary of single dose toxicity studies.

Major findings 
Treatment related decreases in body weight and weight gain was observed in all animals 
receiving GW685698X;. 
Lymphoid depletion (moderate/ very marked) was noted in the mesenteric lymph nodes, 
spleen  and  thymus  of  animals  receiving  GW685698X.  in  addition,  minor  treatment 
related changes were seen in the adrenals of both sexes (increased cortical vacuolation) 
and the liver of females (lipid vacuolation). Full or partial recovery was seen in animals 
killed on Day 15. 
Damage  at  the  injection  site,  ranging  up  to  moderate  severity,  was  noted  for  animals 
receiving vehicle or GW685698X.. 
The  vehicle  used  in  this  study  (10%  (w/w)  ethanol  :  90%  (w/w)  PEG400)  resulted  in 
very slight to moderate damage to the injection site in both treated and control animals 
and similar signs as observed in the range finding study. 
Body weight losses were observed in both sexes, with slight body weight loss observed 
in treated males. Marked atrophy was observed in the thymus of all animals on day 3 and 
slight  lymphoid  atrophy  of  the  spleen.  Observed  effects  were  reversible  with  only  one 
animal showing slight signs of lymphoid atrophy in the spleen by day 15.  
Marked  transient  weight  loss  from  day1  -3  in  all  treated  animals.  Exposure  to 
GW685698X  caused  a  size  reduction  of  the  thymus  with  reddish  discoloration  of  the 
thymus  and  the  bronchial  lymph  nodes.  Microscopic  findings  revealed  atrophy  and 
histocytosis  of  the  thymus  in  all  treated  animals,  as  well  as  atrophy  of  the 
tracheobronchial  lymph  nodes.  Findings  in  the  lymph  nodes  were  almost  completely 
reversed by day 15.    
There  were  no  signs  of  irritancy  associated  histopathological  findings  indicative  of 
gastrointestinal tract irritation, approximately 48 hours after treatment.

•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies FF was administered by the inhaled route (mice, rats, dogs) and by 
the intranasal route (rats, dogs). The repeat dose studies are very important for the non-clinical safety 
assessment of intranasal FF taking into account its proposed long-term use.

Table 10 
Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  of  FF  after  intranasal  administration  (Source: 
Module 2.6.7.) 
Further to the reporting by the applicant of a GLP non-compliance issue in study BVR157 (Toxicity 
study by inhalation administration to Wistar Han rats for 26 weeks – GSK report R23653) conducted 
at  a  contract  research  facility,  a  GLP  inspection of  the  study  facility  was  performed.  The  inspection 
focused on clinical chemistry data generated in the studies performed at this facility which had been 
submitted  as  part  of  the  Avamys  dossier.  The  inspection  concluded  that  the  corticosterone  assays 
performed  on  week  26  samples  from  study  R23653  were  determined  to  be  unreliable.  An  amended 
final  report  without  these  results  was  produced.  All  other  specialised  clinical  chemistry  assays 
performed within the 11 studies audited were considered reliable.  
The  battery  of  multiple  dose  inhalation  and  intranasal  toxicological  studies  of  FF  administered  to 
mice, rats and dogs revealed a range of findings class-specific to glucocorticoids. These findings were 
typically  associated  with  systemic  exposure  to  glucocorticoids  and  commonly  reported  for  other 
marketed intranasal steroids.

Both local and systemic effects observed after intranasal administration were related to the estimated 
maximum  nasal  doses  greatly  exceeding  the  dose  in  humans  occurring  after  intranasal  dosage

proposed  for  Avamys.    They  were  28-,  10-  and  20-fold  higher  in  rats  (one  study)  and  in  dogs  (two 
studies) respectively.  Local effects observed in the long-term intranasal studies (confined to minimal 
goblet cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelium) indicate an acceptable level of safety. 
Testicular  findings  in  the  dog  (tubular  vacuolation)  observed  following  28-day  intranasal  exposure 
were considered not to be significant in light of the lack of clear treatment related findings together wit 
negligible clinical exposure. 
Toxicokinetic  analysis  of  parameters  obtained  during  toxicity  studies  suggests  that  the  risk  of  the 
occurrence  of  significant  systemic  effects  related  to  glucocorticosteroid  activity  of  FF  is  unlikely 
because  of  negligible  systemic  exposure  to  FF  after  intranasal  use  in  doses  proposed  for  Avamys. 
The  lack  of  a  comparative  analysis  of  toxicological  profiles  of  FF  and  FP  was  raised  as  a  CHMP 
concern in the Day 120 List of Questions (LOQ). In their response the applicant submitted a general 
comparative  review  of  toxicology  findings  observed  in  non-clinical  studies  of  FP  and  FF,  which 
indicated that both compounds have similar effects, typical of corticosteroids.  
•  Genotoxicity 
The results of submitted in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity tests did not reveal any significant risk 
carried by FF. The lack of genotoxicity of FF was verified positively in carcinogenicity studies.  
Nevertheless, an additional micronucleus study was conducted at high intravenous doses (up to 40 
mg/kg) on request of the FDA. The results of the study were submitted together with the Day121 
responses “WD2006/02023/00. GW68569X: Additional Rat Bone Marrow Micronucleus Assay in 
Rats (GSK Study R26808)”.  At all doses tested a small reduction in group mean %PCE 
(polychromatic erythrocytes) was observed. As all values were within the historical control range it 
was not considered to be of any biological significance. FF did not induce micronuclei in rats in a 
valid in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay, after two intravenous doses of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg/day, 
given approximately 24 hours apart. 
On  the  basis  of  the  data  submitted,  there  is  no  risk  of  genotoxicity/mutagenicity  of  FF  even  if 
administered  at  dosages  producing  very  high  systemic  exposure,  impossible  to  obtain  in  clinical 
practice after proposed intranasal administration. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  was  studied  in  mice  and  rats  following  intranasal  administration  for  2  years  (Table 
12).  There  was  no  evidence  of  treatment-related  increases  in  tumour  incidence  following  lifetime 
administration  of  FF  by  the  inhalation  route.  Although  the  incidence  of  bronchioloalveolar  tumours 
was  increased  in  intermediate  dose  male  mice,  it  was  similar  to  the  historical  background  incidence 
levels for CD-1 mice, and there was no increase at the highest dose administered.

•  Local tolerance  
A formulation irritancy study was performed in dogs (Beagle) in order to check irritancy potential of 
two  different  formulations  (containing  Triton  X-100  (5%  w/w)  versus  Tyloxapol  (5%  w/w)).  The 
Triton  X-100  formulation  was  not  tolerated  and  caused  nasal  irritancy,  whereas  there  were  no 
treatment  related  findings  with  the  Tyloxapol  formulation.  Neither  formulation  was  selected  for 
development. 
Evaluation of local tolerance demonstrated practically no irritancy to the skin and eyes of rabbits.  
A study in rabbit to evaluate the potential ocular irritancy of the intranasal clinical formulation of FF 
(0.05%  w/w  aqueous  suspension)  showed  that  there  is  a  very  low  potential  for  ocular  irritancy.  A 
volume  administered  during  the  study  was  equivalent  to  double  spray  volume  per  actuation  of  the 
clinical dosage device. 
Dermal irritancy was evaluated in 2 studies in rabbits. The substance was administered in solid form 
(0.5 mg for 4 hours) and  as  2 µg/mL solution in ethanol (0.5 ml for16 hours). The observations were 
continued up to 72 hours after removal of the dressing. No erythema or oedema symptoms were noted. 
Immunotoxicity  
• 
Inhalation  tolerability  and  immunological  sensitisation  was  investigated  in  the  guinea  pig  (5  daily 
doses  followed  by  single inhalation  challenge  exposure  17  days  later).    No  hypersensitivity  reaction 
was noted. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The regulatory and scientific strategy of ERA chosen by the applicant is reasonable and the scope of 
studies (Phase I and Phase II, Tier 1) acceptable. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The dossier submitted, containing applicant’s data supported by literature references, indicates that 
the pharmacological profile of FF is well defined. Its mode of action is typical for corticosteroids. 
The  results  of  in  vitro  pharmacodynamic  studies  indicate  that  FF  exhibits  anti-inflammatory 
activity which is class specific for glucocorticoids used in anti-inflammatory therapy. The in vitro 
potency of FF in term of receptor affinity, receptor selectivity and anti-inflammatory activity is at 
least  equal  or  higher  than  that  of  previously  approved  glucocorticoids  in  AR  therapy,  such  as  FP 
and MF. The activity of the primary metabolite of FF (GW694301X) is much lower than FF. 
Results of in vitro onset and duration of action studies and in vitro tissue binding studies indicate 
that  FF  has  clinical  potential  in  respect  of  very  rapid  GR  activation  (maximum  effect  observed 
after  20  minutes)  and  long  duration  of  action  (until  30  hours).  This  characteristic  has  a  positive 
impact on the reduction of systemic exposure to FF. 
The  in  vivo  studies  support  the  opinion  that  the  in  vitro  profile  of  FF  is  group-specific.  These 
studies  demonstrate  that  it  is  an  effective,  high  affinity  anti-inflammatory  agent  in  a  number  of 
distinct animal models of inflammation.   
CHMP  considered  the  lack  of  comparative  analysis  with  FP  in  the  majority  of  in  vitro 
pharmacology  studies  as  a  weak  side  of  this  part  of  the  dossier.  This  concern  was  resolved  by 
submission  of  additional  (indirect)  comparative  review  data  with  FP  (as  response  to  the  Day  120 
LOQ), showing similar toxicology profiles. 
The  results  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  indicate  no  significant  effects  of  FF  other  than 
corticosteroid-specific.  These  effects  were  observed  only  when  the  route  of  administration  and  dose 
administered produced systemic exposure definitely higher in comparison to exposure obtained after 
intranasal administration in humans as proposed for Avamys. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of FF was adequately examined. Generally speaking, its pharmacokinetic 
profile is similar between animal species tested and humans. The dog is a species with the highest 
similarity to humans in term of FF pharmacokinetics. 
©EMEA 2008 
19/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of FF absorbed systemically after intranasal administration is similar 
to oral and intravenous administration. The oral route of administration used in non-clinical studies 
may be acknowledged as partially simulating the intranasal route. 
Subcutaneous administration of FF is connected with “depot effects” (subcutaneous depot of drug 
which is released gradually). 
The most important pharmacokinetic data from studies performed in dogs following intranasal 
administration indicate that systemic bioavailability of FF after intranasal administration is minimal 
(less than 1%). In addition, there is the first pass effect accompanied by an effective biotransformation 
to inactive metabolite and rapid elimination. 
There is no real risk of FF accumulation after intranasal administration at the dose as proposed for 
Avamys. 
Based on the very small systemic availability of FF (administered intranasally) the risk related to its 
systemic toxicity in proposed clinical dosage is low. Thus, the burden of toxicological assessment 
concentrated mainly on the local toxicity to the tissues being in direct contact with the product at the 
site of administration. 
The  toxicology  profile  of  the  product  is  well  documented.  The  comparative  toxicokinetic  data 
confirmed that intranasal administration of FF in doses proposed for Avamys produces no measurable 
systemic  exposure  to  FF  and  that  occurrence  of  systemic  glucocorticoid  activity  after  Avamys 
administration is unlikely. 
4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical dossier includes 22 pharmacology and 12 phase II/III original studies. The applicant states 
that phase II/III clinical trials were designed in accordance with FDA draft guideline “Allergic rhinitis: 
Clinical Development Programs for Drug Products” (FDA- 2000) and the CHMP Guideline on the 
Clinical Development of Medicinal Products for the treatment of Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis (CHMP 
2004). 
The Scientific Advice received from CHMP in July 2004 concerned the following issues: 
•  Duration of the SAR/PAR clinical development program in adult, adolescent and 
paediatric populations; 
Inclusion of active control arm in SAR/PAR studies in addition to vehicle placebo control; 
• 
•  Total nasal symptoms score alone as an appropriate primary efficacy endpoint for the 
SAR/PAR populations; 
•  Adequacy of safety and efficacy data in the proposed clinical program for registration for 
the indications SAR and PAR in adults, adolescents and the paediatric population; 
•  Benzalkonium chloride  - preservative in formulation. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Pharmacokinetics 
This product for intranasal topical use is intended for local delivery of fluticasone furoate. The main 
aim  of  PK  studies  is  the  extent  of  systemic  absorption  (as  per  the  Note  for  Guidance  on 
pharmacokinetics) in targeted populations for safety reasons. 
The applicant presented 22 clinical pharmacology studies in support of the MAA (table 14). Eight of 
those were conducted with claimed formulation and route of administration (intranasal).

The method used for analysis of plasma samples collected for pharmacokinetic profiling of fluticasone 
furoate during the clinical development programme involved solid phase extraction and high pressure 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (SPE- HPLC-MS/MS). The method 
has been validated and demonstrates reliable and reproducible quantisation of fluticasone furoate. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis was performed on the basis of all 22 phase I studies and additionally 
the phase IIb study and five phase III (2 adult and 3 children) studies providing pharmacokinetic data. 
The analysis could have been more transparent if the applicant had restricted to those studies involving 
the claimed formulation and route of administration. 
The statistical methods were adequate. 
•  Absorption and distribution 
−  Bioavailability 
Study FFR 10001 examined the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of single and 
multiple intranasal doses of FF. Twelve healthy male volunteers received single doses of 50, 100, 200 
µg FF (cohort A) and twelve received doses of 200, 400, 800 µg FF (cohort B). The multiple dosing 
part of the study consisted of seven daily doses at the 200 µg and 800 µg level for cohorts A and B 
respectively.  
FF levels were undetectable in most volunteers at most time points and only at the highest single dose 
was it possible to estimate Cmax. No other pharmacokinetic parameters could be established for any 
dose  either  single  or  multiple.  The  24  hour  time-course  for  serum  cortisol  for  7  day  treatments  for 
placebo, 200 µg, 800 µg were overlapping.

Study  FFR  10002  examined  the  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  and  tolerability  of  single 
increasing intranasal doses of FF administered as a solution formulation. It was conducted at a single 
UK  centre  between  August  and  October  2002.  Twenty-four  healthy  male  volunteers  received  single 
doses of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 µg FF with a five-day washout between dose escalations.  Many individuals 
and time points showed no quantifiable drug levels; derived pharmacokinetic data for the 80 µg dose 
are shown in Table 17.  There was no dose response relationship with respect to plasma cortisol levels.

Upon  request  from  CHMP  (Day  120),  the  applicant  provided  clarification  regarding  the  higher 
bioavailability observed in study FFR 10002 compared to FFR 10001; this was ascribed to use of an 
experimental  solution  formulation  with  poorly  water  soluble  drug  in  FFR10002;  no  further 
development work was conducted with this formulation. 
Study  FFR10010  aimed  to  establish  the  absolute  bioavailability  of  a  single  intranasal  dose  of  FF. 
Sixteen healthy volunteers participated (8 male and 8 female). Subjects received intranasal FF 880 µg, 
8-hourly  for  a  total  of  10  doses,  and  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  FF  250  µg.  The  absolute 
bioavailability of FF was 0.50% (90% CI 0.34 – 0.74). The derived pharmacokinetic parameters are 
shown in Table 18.

−  Bioequivalence 
Although different formulations are mentioned in the data submitted, only one has persisted  beyond 
very  early  clinical  trials.  All  the  development  work  has  been  done  with  the  same  formulation. 
Therefore, bioequivalence studies are not necessary. 
•  Elimination 
−  Excretion 
Study  FFR10008  was  a  mass  balance  evaluation  of  the  elimination  of  FF.    Five  healthy  male 
volunteers  received  single  doses  of  2,000  µg  [14C]-FF  orally,  and  250  µg  [14C]-FF  intravenously, 
separated by a washout of 28 days. Blood, urine and faeces were collected for 168 hours or until 90% 
of  the  radioactivity  had  been  recovered.    Following  oral  administration  101%  of  radioactivity  was 
recovered  in  faeces  by  168  hours.  Following  intravenous  administration  90%  of  radioactivity  was 
recovered in faeces by 264 hours.

Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 1% and 2.6% of the administered dose following oral 
and i.v. administration respectively.   
FF was quantifiable up to 48 hours post intravenous dosing; but only up to 9 hours post oral dosing. 
The  metabolite  GW694301X  was  quantifiable  up  to  3  hours  following  oral  dosing  and  was  not 
quantifiable after intravenous dosing.   
The bioavailability of FF from the oral solution was 1.26% (95% CI 0.463 - 3.418).  
Following i.v. dosing, the clearance of FF was 57.45 L/h (95% CI 45.51 - 72.52) which is similar to 
liver blood flow (49 L/h) and the volume of distribution was 608.4 L (95% CI 375.4 - 985.8).  
The  terminal  phase  elimination  half-life  of  FF  following  intravenous  dosing  was  15.12  h  (95%  CI: 
11.82 - 19.35h).  In vitro plasma protein binding was >99%. 
−  Metabolism 
Study  report  WD2005/01496/00  describes  the  characterisation  of  the  major  metabolites  of  FF 
following  a  single  injection  in healthy male  volunteers  (Study  FFR10008).  Due  to  the  low  levels  of 
radioactive  drug-related  material  in  plasma  and  excreta  accelerator  mass  spectrometry  (AMS)  was 
required  as  the  detector  to  obtain  metabolite  profiles  in  plasma.  Assignments  of  metabolites  relied 
extensively on co-chromatography with reference standards.  
Following intravenous administration to healthy male subjects, the principal radiolabelled component 
in  plasma  was  unchanged  FF.  Following  oral  administration  there  were  two  notable  radiolabelled 
components  in  plasma:    the  17-β-carboxylic  acid  of  FF  (GW694301X  also  called  M10)  and  parent 
compound. There was no other component representing more than 5% of total plasma radioactivity. 
Elimination of FF was largely by metabolism via the faeces with hydrolysis of the thioester moiety to 
GW694301X  (M10)  as  the  predominant  route.  The  only  other  route  of  metabolism  involved 
defluorination and hydroxylation. Unchanged FF was a minor component in faecal samples from all 
subjects by either dosage route.  
Following  oral  and  intravenous  dosing  approximately  30%  of  the  administered  dose  of  drug  related 
material was identified; the remainder was not identifiable due to low levels precluding useful mass 
spectrometric data. Urinary excretion of drug-related material was minor (<3%) and therefore was not 
investigated further. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Given the very low plasma drug levels following intranasal administration it is difficult to reach any 
meaningful conclusion on dose proportionality. Following dosage by the inhalational route there is 
evidence of approximate dose proportionality. 
•  Special populations 
−  Hepatic impairment 
Study FFA10013 was an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of FF in subjects 
with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh-B  7-9)  (n  =  10)  and  in  healthy  subjects  (n  =  10) 
following a single inhaled dose of 400 µg FF.  Patients were matched with controls for gender, age, 
and lean body mass. The derived indices of absorption and excretion are in Table 19.

No studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function because there is negligible 
renal elimination of FF. 
−  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The pharmacokinetics in adults and adolescents is sufficiently documented in phase I studies. The 
analysis of PK data from paediatric studies is not clear. CHMP requested clarification from the 
applicant: presentation of PK data from paediatric studies in 2 groups, i.e. children between 12 and 6 
years of age and children between 6 and 2 years of age. The applicant’s response presented robust data 
for the population above 6 years; data for the 2 to 5 year olds are very limited. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Report  FD2003/00126/00  describes  the  effect  of  FF  on  the  metabolism  of  specific  substrates  for 
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in a pooled human hepatic microsome system.  Positive controls 
were used for all tests. FF inhibited the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8 
and CYP2D6, but not CYP1A2, CYP2A6 and CYP2E1.  The most potent inhibition was observed on 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (IC50 ≤ 0.8 µg/ml); for the other enzymes the IC50 was ≤ 5.4 µg/ml.  There 
was no potential as a time and NADPH dependent inhibitor of any of the cytochrome P450 enzymes 
investigated.  
Report  WD2005/00543/00  describes  the  effects  of  the  FF  metabolite  GW694301X  on  the  CYP450 
enzymes  in  a  pooled  human  hepatic  microsome  system.  There  was  no  direct  or  metabolism-based 
inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4.  
Report  WD2005/00763/00  showed  that  FF  and  GW694301X  inhibit  the  human  organic  ion 
transporter  OATP1B1,  heterogeneously  expressed  in  the  CHO  cell  line  (Chinese  Hamster  Ovary), 
with calculated IC50 values of 0.11 µg/ml and 1.4 µg/ml respectively.   
Report FD2005/00368/00 was an investigation of the effects of FF and GW694301X on the transport 
of digoxin by MDCKII cells which express the human efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. There was no 
inhibition  of  drug  transport  by  FF  or  GW694301X  up  to  concentrations  of  30  µM  and  100  µM 
respectively. 
In vivo 
Study  FFR10013  was  an  evaluation  of  the  potential  for  an  interaction  between  the  potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor,  ketoconazole,  and  FF.  The  study  was  a  7-day,  double  blind,  placebo  controlled,  two-way 
crossover evaluation of the effect of co-administration of ketoconazole 200 mg daily and FF 110 µg 
daily administered by nasal spray. Twenty-four hour serum cortisol weighted mean on Day 7 was the 
variable of primary interest. Twenty healthy male volunteers completed the study.

For  the  majority  of  subjects  drug  levels  of  FF  were  below  the  limit  of  quantification  at  most  time 
points.  Drug  levels  were  detectable  in  one  subject  on  FF/placebo  and  in  six  subjects  on 
FF/ketoconazole. Data for twenty-four hour serum cortisol weighted mean are shown in Table 20.

In the Day 120 LOQ, CHMP requested additional information from the applicant regarding the 
possible consequences of concomitant use of moderate and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors from a safety 
perspective, and asked the applicant to submit revised proposals for relevant parts of the SPC. In their 
response the applicant stated that although inhibition of the metabolism of FF by inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 increases systemic exposure, levels observed are unlikely to result in any adverse systemic 
effects and therefore proposed no change to SPC section 4.5. As CHMP maintained their concern, the 
applicant proposed to re-arrange the text in SPC section 4.5 and included additional text specifically 
highlighting to the prescriber to be aware of the potential for systemic effects to occur during 
concomitant administration with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, thus conferring a greater prominence to 
this information. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
While the exact pharmacological mechanism of intranasal corticosteroids is not clear, these 
medications are known to reduce vascular permeability and oedema of the nasal mucosa through 
inhibitory effects on inflammatory cells and mediator activity.  As steroids diffuse across the cell 
membrane they bind to specific intracellular receptors, forming a complex that is then transported into 
the nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements. As a result transcription of 
glucocorticoid response element associated genes is either down-regulated or up-regulated. This leads 
to a reduction of the nasal mucosa inflammatory cells and their associated cytokines.  
•  Primary pharmacology 
Report SH2005/00036/00 describes the in vitro binding of FF, fluticasone propionate (FP) and other 
commonly used corticosteroids to the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and inhibition of the NFκB 
pathway.  The principal results are shown in Table 5.

Study  FFR101816  was  a  double  blind,  placebo-controlled,  single-dose,  evaluation  of  the  onset  of 
action of  FF 110 µg in adolescent and adult patients with  seasonal allergic rhinitis  and a history of  
ragweed  pollen  sensitivity.    They  received  a  single  dose  of  placebo  or  FF  110  µg  and  had  a  twelve 
hour allergen exposure in an allergen chamber. The variables of interest were changing from baseline 
in total nasal symptom score (NTSS) and the speed of onset of action of FF. The study was powered 
on the assumption that the standard deviation in change from baseline of NTSS and the sample size 
380 patients gave 90% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.75 NTSS with α = 0.05. The result 
for the primary efficacy variable is shown in Table 22.

•  Secondary pharmacology 
Study  FFA103096  was  a  5-way  crossover  trial  in  44  healthy  men  and  women.  Each  treatment 
period consisted of eight days, during which the subjects received inhaled FF once daily, fluticasone 
propionate (FP) twice daily or placebo on Days 1–7, with a 24 h urine and serum cortisol profile on 
Day 7. The primary objective was to estimate the dose of FF that had an equivalent effect on twenty-
four serum cortisol excretion as FP 1000 µg daily. Treatments consisted of placebo, FF 100, 200, 400, 
800, 1600 µg, FP 250, 500, 1000 µg. All treatments were delivered by dry powder inhaler. A predicted 
dose of FF of approximately 650µg QD from the dry powder inhaler was found  to be equivalent in 
effect on 0-24h serum cortisol to FP dry powder inhaler 500 µg twice daily.

•  Dose response studies 
Study FFR20001 evaluated doses of FF 55, 110, 220, 440 µg once daily by aqueous nasal spray for 
fourteen days in adolescent and adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to Mountain Cedar 
pollen. The total nasal symptom score (TNSS) is the sum of four individual symptom scores for 
rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing, where each symptom is scored 0 to 3 giving 
a maximum score of 12.  Patients were predominantly (~ 90%) in the age group 18 – 65 years, with 
7% below 18 years and less than 1% above 75 years; approximately two thirds were female. The 
principal outcomes are shown in Table 6. All efficacy differences from placebo are statistically 
significant ( p < 0.001)

•  Main studies 
Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) 
Study  FFR103184  was  a  two  week,  double  blind,  placebo  controlled,  evaluation  of  the  safety  and 
efficacy of intranasal FF 110 µg once daily in adult and adolescent patients suffering from seasonal 
allergic  rhinitis  (SAR)  triggered  by  grass  pollen.  The  principal  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  effect  on 
change from baseline on total nasal symptom score (TNSS) during the full treatment period. 
The study was powered on the basis that 288 subjects were required, based on results from the dose 
finding trial which suggested the standard deviation of mean change from baseline over the treatment 
period  was  2.6.  Using  a  two-sample  t-test  with  a  two  sided  significance  level  of  0.05,  288  patients 
should provide 90% power to detect a difference of 1.0 [in NTSS score] between active treatment and 
placebo. 
The results for study completion and the primary efficacy variable are shown in Table 25.

Clinical studies in children 
Study FFR30008 was a twelve week, double blind, placebo controlled, evaluation of the safety and 
efficacy  of  intranasal  FF  55  µg  and  110  µg  once  daily  in  paediatric  patients  aged  2  to  11  years 
suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). It was anticipated that 25% and 75% of those enrolled 
would be 2 to <6 and 6 to <12 years of age, respectively. Due to the difficulty in assessing subjective 
symptoms  in  very  young  subjects,  the  6  to  <12  years  population  was  selected  as  the  primary 
population  of  interest  for  efficacy.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  age.  Patients  had  at  least  a  one 
year  history  of  PAR  (six-months  for  those  aged  less  than  four  years)  triggered  by  an  appropriate 
allergen.  The  principal  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  effect  on  change  from  baseline  on  total  nasal 
symptom score (TNSS) during the first four study weeks of the FF 110 µg treatment arm compared to 
placebo. 
The study was powered on the basis that 432 subjects were required based on results from the dose 
finding trial in seasonal allergic rhinitis.  The principal outcome is shown in Table 29.

FFR101747 was  a  two-week,  crossover,  placebo-controlled  study  of 58  children  aged  6  to  11 years 
with seasonal and/or perennial allergic rhinitis. The study evaluated the effect on short-term lower-leg 
growth  of  two  weeks’  treatment  with  FF  nasal  spray  110  µg  daily  using  a  knemometer.  Eligible 
subjects were females 6 to <11 years of age or males 6 to <12 years of age, with a documented clinical 
history of SAR and/or PAR. The primary endpoint was the mean growth rate (mm/wk) in lower-leg 
length,  with a  margin  of  non-inferiority  set  at  -0.20  mm/wk.    The  principal  outcome  of  the  study  is

Study FFR20002 was a six-week, double blind, placebo and active controlled evaluation of the 
effects of FF 110 µg once daily by nasal spray on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) 
axis.  Subjects of 12 to 65 years of age with a physician confirmed diagnosis of perennial allergic 
rhinitis and a positive skin test to a relevant antigen. Patients were randomised 4:4:1 to FF 110 µg: 
placebo: oral prednisone 10 mg daily.  The primary comparison was FF non-inferiority to placebo of  
0-24h serum cortisol, with a non-inferiority margin of the lower limit of the  95% confidence interval 
for the mean ratio being greater than 0.80 the study has approximately 90% power to demonstrate non-

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The data submitted from concluded clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate in 
the treatment of the symptoms of SAR.  Fluticasone furoate nasal spray demonstrated statistically 
significant reductions from baseline compared with placebo for the primary endpoint daily rTNSS 
(reflective TNSS) over the entire treatment period in the SAR studies.  The treatment differences were 
-2.012 (FFR20001), -1.757 (FFR103184), -1.473 (FFR104861) and -0.777 (FFR30003).  These 
treatment differences were within the range observed with marketed products that are effective for 
allergic rhinitis. The results for the primary endpoint were supported by the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint AM pre-dose iTNSS (instantaneous TNSS); treatment effect ranged from -0.902 to -1.898, 
p<0.001 across the studies. This confirmed that once-daily administration of fluticasone furoate 
maintained the improvement in nasal symptoms of SAR until the end of the 24-hour dosing interval.  
Similar improvements were seen for AM and PM rTNSS suggesting consistent daytime and night time 
symptom relief.  No individual nasal symptom disproportionately influenced the composite score for 
rTNSS and the resulting overall treatment difference over placebo.  
The three Phase 3 studies also confirmed the efficacy on ocular symptoms demonstrated in the Phase 
2b study.  The treatment effect on rTOSS (reflective total ocular symptoms score) ranged from -0.546 
to -0.741 (p≤0.008) across the three studies, which is within the range expected with oral 
antihistamines used in clinical practice, such as desloratadine.  These findings were generally 
supported by the mean change from baseline in AM pre-dose iTOSS, AM and PM rTOSS and by 
individual ocular symptom scores, where fluticasone furoate showed significantly greater 
improvements compared with placebo for most endpoints. Across the studies, scores for subjects 
treated with fluticasone furoate 110mcg were significantly better than placebo, with a large proportion 
reporting moderate to significant improvement in this group compared with placebo (integrated 
analysis results: 52% and 30%, respectively).   
The overall findings from FFR30002 demonstrated that fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110mcg was 
effective in improving the nasal symptoms of PAR and confirm that the once daily administration of 
fluticasone furoate nasal spray adequately maintains the improvement in nasal symptoms of PAR until 
the end of the 24-hour dosing interval. The treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoint (mean 
change from baseline in daily rTNSS) was statistically significant over placebo (-0.706, p=0.005). 
This was within the range expected for an intranasal corticosteroid currently used in clinical practice. 
The primary efficacy results were supported by the data from the key secondary endpoints.  The mean 
change from baseline in AM pre-dose iTNSS was significantly greater for fluticasone furoate nasal 
spray than placebo with a treatment difference of -0.705 (p=0.006).  The statistical analysis of overall 
response to therapy supported the results of the primary endpoint.  More subjects treated with 
fluticasone furoate reported moderate to significant improvements compared with those on placebo 
(44% and 33%, respectively). Other secondary endpoints were also supportive of the primary 
endpoint.  Similar improvements over placebo were seen with the AM and PM scores, suggesting 
consistent daytime and night time symptom relief.  For individual nasal symptoms of rhinorrhoea, 
sneezing and nasal itching, significant improvements were seen with fluticasone furoate nasal spray

110mcg compared with placebo; these findings contributed equally to the overall rTNSS score 
reduction. 
Of the clinical studies in children FFR100010 showed that fluticasone furoate 110mcg demonstrated a 
greater reduction from baseline in rTNSS compared with placebo over the 2-week treatment period 
(-0.616, p=0.025).  The treatment difference was significant in favour of fluticasone furoate 110mcg 
for the key secondary and the other nasal symptom-related secondary endpoints.  For fluticasone 
furoate 55mcg, there were no statistically significantly greater improvements in SAR symptoms 
compared with placebo for the primary (-0.161, p=0.553) or secondary endpoints. In the 12-week PAR 
study FFR30008, the efficacy results were somewhat discordant with the SAR study results for the 
two doses (110mcg and 55mcg).  The mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS for fluticasone 
furoate 110mcg was numerically greater than placebo, although not statistically significant (-0.452, 
p=0.073).  The 110mcg dose resulted in numerically greater changes than placebo for the key 
secondary and other secondary efficacy endpoints, which were statistically significant for some 
endpoints, including AM iTNSS (-0.651, p=0.009) and individual scores of nasal congestion, 
rhinorrhoea and sneezing.  For fluticasone furoate 55mcg, the treatment effect over placebo was 
significant for daily rTNSS (-0.754, p=0.003) and for all key secondary and other secondary endpoints 
excluding AM reflective nasal itching. 
A significant treatment effect was not achieved on the primary efficacy endpoint for the fluticasone 
furoate 110mcg treatment group over the first 4 weeks.  However, FFR30008 was unusual in that 
compared with placebo, the response to the 110mcg dose increased with time in the FFR30008 study.  
A significantly greater reduction in daily rTNSS for the RITT population 6 to <12 years of age was 
observed over Weeks 1 to 6 (-0.584, p=0.018 for fluticasone furoate 110mcg; -0.862, p<0.001 for 
fluticasone furoate 55mcg) and Weeks 1 to 12 (-0.672, p=0.006 for fluticasone furoate 110mcg; -
0.816, p<0.001 for fluticasone furoate 55mcg) compared with placebo for both the 110mcg and 55mcg 
doses; this was supported by the results in the entire RITT population.   
As requested in the CHMP Day 120 LOQ,  the applicant reported the results of PK/PD, efficacy and 
safety separately for the age group 2-5 and 6-12, as well as justification for the inclusion in the 
indication of children below 6 years of age .The CHMP view was that the number of patients from the 
subpopulation aged 2-5 years (176 patients exposed to FF in clinical trials) is very limited and does 
not allow to reach any safety or dosing conclusion.  
The lower age limit for the indication, as well as the lack of a study with active comparator was 
further addressed during the Oral Explanation (please refer to Overall Conclusions). 
Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
A total of 3954 adult, adolescent, and paediatric subjects participated in the Phase II/III studies, with 
approximately 60% of subjects (2359) treated with FF  110 µg (1990) or FF 55 µg (369). This does 
not include the 386 subjects in the dose ranging study (FFR20001) who were treated with the 55mcg, 
220mcg, and 440mcg dosages of fluticasone furoate and the 58 subjects who were randomized in the 
knemometry study (FFR101747) that utilized a crossover design.  
The  majority  of  SAR  and  PAR  studies  were  2  -  12  weeks  in  treatment  duration,  and  thus 
approximately  80%  of  the  subject  exposures  were  12  weeks  or  less.  In  the  safety  database  of  3954 
subjects,  501  (25%)  of  the  subjects  (adults  and  adolescents)  exposed  to  fluticasone  furoate  110mcg 
once daily were exposed to treatment for a period of ≥6 months and 400 (20%) adult and adolescent 
subjects were exposed for ≥12 months.  
More  female  subjects  (1262  of  the  female  subjects  treated  with  the  110mcg  or  55mcg  dosages  of 
fluticasone furoate) than male subjects (1097 of the male subjects treated with the 110mcg or 55mcg 
dosages  of  fluticasone  furoate)  were  exposed  to  fluticasone  furoate  in  the  clinical  development 
program. 
The  largest  number  of  subjects exposed to fluticasone furoate 110mcg in the clinical development 
program  was  in  the  18  to  <65  year  age  group;  1333  of  these  subjects  treated  with  the  110mcg 
dosage. In the adolescent population (aged 12 to <18 years), 198 subjects were exposed to fluticasone 
furoate 110mcg in the clinical studies.

In the paediatric, phase 3 placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (subjects ≥2 to <12 years 
of  age),  176  subjects  2  to  <6  years  of  age  were  treated  with  the  110mcg  or  55mcg  dosages  of 
fluticasone furoate and 618 paediatric subjects 6 to <12 years of age were treated with the 110mcg 
or  55mcg  dosages;  54  of  these  subjects  were  ≥2  to  <4  years  of  age  and  were  treated  with  either  a 
55mcg or 110mcg dosage of fluticasone furoate nasal spray.  
To  assess  for  potential  systemic  corticosteroid  effects,  a  12-month  adult  and  adolescent  study 
FFR102123  and  the  12-week  paediatric  study  FFR30008  (described  in  the  section  on  Efficacy) 
included ophthalmic examinations and outpatient collection of urine for 24-hour cortisol excretion. 
Study FFR102123 was a one year, double blind, placebo controlled evaluation of the safety of FF 110 
µg  once  daily.    It  was  carried  out  at  seventy-five  centres  internationally,  from  September  2004  to 
December 2005.  Eligible subjects were at least 12 years of age with a diagnosis of perennial allergic 
rhinitis for at least two years and a positive skin test to a relevant antigen (animal dander, dust mite 
etc.) within the last year. They were required to have a TNSS of at least 4 during the screening week 
prior to randomisation. Randomisation was 3:1 to active and placebo treatments.  Subjects with other 
significant systemic or nasal health problems were excluded. Use of local or systemic steroids or other 
allergy  treatments  was  not  allowed.  No  statistical  assumptions  were  made  so  the  study  was  not 
specifically powered to detect any defined event. 
During the procedure the report of a perennial allergic rhinitis study, which was ongoing at the time of 
initial submission of the MAA, was submitted with the applicant’s responses to the CHMP Day 120 
List of Questions. Study FFR 106080 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily intranasal administration of 
GW685698X  aqueous  nasal  spray  110mcg  for  6  weeks  in  adult  and  adolescent  subjects  12 years  of 
age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). A total of 302 subjects were randomised, 151 in 
each of the fluticasone furoate 110mcg and placebo groups. 
Results of the study FFR 106080 are in line with those seen in the pivotal studies, in particular with 
the clinical efficacy and safety of the 110 mcg daily dose of FF. 
•  Adverse events 
Standard  safety  evaluations  (i.e.,  adverse  events,  laboratory  evaluations,  vital  signs  and  ECG)  and 
detailed nasal examinations were performed in all studies.  In order to obtain an accurate assessment 
of  adverse  event  frequencies  the  safety  data  obtained  from  the  adult  and  adolescent  studies  with  a 
treatment  duration  of  six  weeks  or  less  were  integrated  (i.e.,  FFR20001,  FFR30003,  FFR103184, 
FFR104861,  FFR30002  and  FFR20002).  For  the  paediatric  studies,  adverse  event  data  from  studies 
FFR100010, FFR30008 and FFR100012 were integrated.  
Adverse events in adults and adolescent studies 
Few subjects receiving fluticasone furoate in clinical trials reported moderate or significant worsening 
compared with those receiving placebo (integrated analysis results: 3% and 12%, respectively). 
In  6  adult  and  adolescent  studies  (FFR20001,  FFR20002,  FFR30002,  FFR30003,  FFR103184, 
FFR104861),  29%  of  subjects  in  the  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110mcg  group  and  27%  in  the 
placebo group experienced at least one adverse event (AE) during the treatment period. All AEs that 
occurred at an incidence rate of ≥1% are summarized in table 35. 
Adverse  events  that  occurred  more  commonly  in  the  fluticasone  furoate  110mcg  group  than  in  the 
placebo  group  were  headache,  epistaxis,  pharyngolaryngeal  pain,  nasal  septum  ulceration  and  back 
pain.  The  majority  of  adverse  events  noted  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  across  both  the 
fluticasone furoate and the placebo treatment groups. Overall, of the 209 subjects reporting an AE in 
the  placebo  group,  22  subjects  (11%  of  subjects  reporting  any  AE)  had  adverse  events  classified  as 
severe.  For  the  fluticasone  furoate  110mcg  group,  of  the  225  subjects  reporting  an  AE,  11  subjects 
(5% of the subjects reporting any AE) had an adverse event classified as severe. Less than 1% of the 
subjects  in  the  placebo  and  the  fluticasone  furoate  110mcg  group  reported  severe  headache.    There 
were no reports of severe epistaxis in either treatment group.

In  the  long-term  safety  study  FFR102123, 464  subjects  (77%)  in  the  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray 
110mcg group and 142 subjects (71%) in the placebo nasal spray group experienced at least one AE 
during  the  52-week  treatment  period.  The  ten  most  common  AEs  in  each  treatment  group  are 
summarized in the following table (table 36).  
The  most  common  AEs  in  both  treatment  groups  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  epistaxis, 
pharyngolaryngeal  pain,  back  pain  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection.  Epistaxis  was  more 
commonly  reported  with  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110mcg  than  with  placebo  nasal  spray 
(fluticasone furoate nasal spray 20%, placebo 8%).  
Most of the AEs reported during the long-term safety study (FFR102123) were mild or moderate in 
intensity. The maximum intensity of reported AEs was similar in the two treatment groups, except for 
epistaxis. In the fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110mcg group, 83 subjects (14%) reported epistaxis 
with a maximum intensity of mild, 39 subjects (6%) with a maximum intensity of moderate, and one 
subject reported 2 episodes considered to be severe. In the placebo nasal spray group, all episodes 
of epistaxis were of mild intensity.

1. 
In this study, 106 females were randomized to the placebo group and 307 females were randomized 
to the fluticasone furoate 110mcg group.  Thus, incidences for dysmenorrhoea were 8% (8/106) in 
the placebo group and 7% (22/307) in the fluticasone furoate 110mcg group based on the female 
enrolment.  
In the adult and adolescent clinical studies (including the long-term safety study), adverse events 
considered by the investigators to be drug-related occurred at a very low incidence. The most common 
drug-related AEs which occurred in a higher proportion of subjects treated with fluticasone furoate 
nasal spray than with placebo were epistaxis, nasal ulceration, nasal dryness and headache. Most of 
the drug-related AEs reported in the adult and adolescent studies were mild or moderate in intensity. 
Three subjects in the fluticasone furoate 110mcg group reported drug-related AEs that were of severe 
intensity (epistaxis; anosmia and parosmia; herpes virus infection). 
Adverse events in paediatric studies 
In the 3 paediatric studies (FFR100010, FFR30008, FFR100012), 43% of subjects in the fluticasone 
furoate  nasal  spray  55mcg  group,  41%  in  the  fluticasone  furoate  110mcg  group  and  37%  in  the 
placebo  group  experienced  at  least  one  AE  during  the  treatment  period.    All  adverse  events  that 
occurred  at  a  ≥1%  incidence  in  the  integrated  paediatric  database  are  summarized  in  table  37.  The 
majority  of  adverse  events  reported  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  across  both  the  fluticasone 
furoate  and  the  placebo  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  AEs  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis, 
epistaxis,  pyrexia,  pharyngolaryngeal  pain,  cough  and  bronchitis.  The  incidences  of  all  AEs  in  the 
paediatric population were similar across the two FF treatment groups and the placebo group, with the 
exception  of  pyrexia.  Pyrexia  was  reported  more  frequently  in  the  fluticasone  furoate  treatment 
groups (5% and 4% in the fluticasone furoate 55mcg and 110mcg groups, respectively) compared with 
2% in the placebo group; pyrexia was commonly reported in the 2 to <6 year age group.  
Less than 1% of the subjects in the placebo and the FF 55mcg group, and 1% of the subjects in the 
fluticasone furoate 110mcg treatment group reported a severe adverse event. There were no reports of 
severe epistaxis in either treatment group.  
Adverse events considered by the investigators to be drug-related occurred at a low incidence in the 
paediatric  studies.  The  most  common  drug-related  AEs  were  epistaxis  and  headache  (2%  of  the 
subjects in the FF 110mcg treatment group and 4% of the subjects in the FF 55mcg treatment group 
compared with 3% in the placebo group).  Headache considered drug-related occurred at an incidence 
of <1%, 2% and 1% in the FF 110mcg, the FF 55mcg group and the placebo group respectively.  All 
other drug-related AEs occurred at an incidence of <1% across the treatment groups.

The most common adverse events following nasal inhalation of fluticasone furoate in the clinical 
pharmacology studies [FFR10001, FFR10003, FFR10005, FFR10006, FFR10007, FFR10010 (in this 
study subjects also received a single 250mcg intravenous infusion of fluticasone furoate)] were 
headache and upper respiratory tract symptoms.  There was no clear differentiation between active 
and placebo administration in the incidence of AEs.   
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the fluticasone furoate nasal spray clinical development program.  
Overall, 29 subjects in the adult and adolescent clinical studies (including the long-term safety 
study) experienced a non-fatal serious adverse event.  
Five subjects from the two adult and adolescent studies (FFR104861, FFR30002) experienced non-
fatal serious adverse events (SAEs). In FFR104861, three subjects reported SAEs.; two SAEs during 
the screening period (severe diabetes mellitus, moderate gastroenteritis) and one SAE during the post-
treatment period (severe cholelithiasis six days after the last dose fluticasone furoate 110mcg; this 
event was not considered to be related to study drug). In FFR30002, two subjects experienced SAEs. 
One subject reported breast cancer during the treatment period (not considered drug-related as the 
subject had a history of fibrocystic breast disease when enrolled into the study). One subject in the 
placebo group reported two SAEs during the treatment (severe abdominal pain) and nephrolithiasis in 
the post-treatment period; neither event was considered to be related to study drug as the subject had a 
prior history of renal calculi.  
During the study period in the long-term safety study (FFR102123), 20 subjects (3%) in the 
fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110mcg group and four subjects (2%) in the placebo group experienced 
SAEs. No individual SAE was reported by more than one subject in either treatment group.  None of 
the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment and all were resolved or 
resolving at the end of the study except for one SAE (breast cancer).   
Four subjects, all treated with fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110mcg were withdrawn prematurely 
from the study due to SAEs (glandular polyp of the endometrium and uterine bleeding; worsening 
haemorrhoids; herpes zoster of the face and neck; cervical vertebral fracture).  
Four subjects from the three integrated paediatric studies (FFR100010, FFR30008, FFR100012) 
experienced four non-fatal serious adverse events.  
In FFR100010, one SAE was reported for one subject in the placebo group during the treatment period 
(insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; not considered drug related).  The subject was withdrawn from 
the study. In FFR30008, two subjects experienced SAEs. During the treatment period, SAEs were 
reported for one subject in the FF 55mcg group (peritonitis) and for one subject in the FF 110mcg 
group (appendicitis). Both subjects recovered without sequelae. In FFR100012, one subject in the 
placebo group experienced a fracture of the ulna and radius while roller-skating and was hospitalized.  
Treatment with investigational product was continued.  Neither event was considered related to study 
drug.

•  Laboratory findings 
No safety issues were identified in the laboratory data collected in the integrated SAR/PAR studies in 
adult and adolescent subjects, and paediatric subjects, and in the long-term safety study (FFR102123).  
The majority of subjects in each treatment group had either no change in clinical chemistry and 
haematology parameters or a shift into the normal range during the study periods (over 80%).  The 
percentage of subjects who shifted to above or to below the normal range was low.  The number of 
subjects with non-serious laboratory abnormalities reported as adverse events in these studies was low 
across the programme. 
Nasal examination  
A nasal examination of the turbinates, mucosa, septum and secretions was performed during the 
clinical development program for intranasal fluticasone furoate (nasal patency, size of any polyps and 
ulcers, presence of oropharyngeal or nasal candidiasis). In the integrated adult and adolescent and 
paediatric studies and in the long-term safety study, no particular safety concerns were noted across 
the assessed parameters, with a high proportion of subjects showing no change or improvements in 
nasal examinations.  
In adult and adolescent studies, presence of mucosal bleeding for all visits was similar between the 
fluticasone furoate (0 to 10%) and placebo (0 to 7%) groups, except for week 4 where mucosal 
bleeding was present in 10% of the subjects in the fluticasone furoate group and 3% of the subjects in 
the placebo group. In the long-term safety study FFR102123, mucosal crusting and mucosal bleeding 
were seen in a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the fluticasone furoate group than in the 
placebo group. The proportion of subjects with mucosal crusting and bleeding did not increase with 
longer term treatment. The incidence of ulcers on the turbinates or septum was higher in subjects 
treated with fluticasone furoate (ranging from 2% to 6% at each visit) compared with placebo (ranging 
from 0 to 3% at each visit). 
In paediatric studies, presence of mucosal bleeding was similar between the fluticasone furoate 
110mcg (<1 to 6%), fluticasone furoate 55mcg (0 to 5%), and placebo (1 to 8%) groups.  No subjects 
in any of the treatment groups had findings of ulceration in the turbinates or septum at endpoint. 
No instances of septal perforation were reported during the clinical development program for 
intranasal fluticasone furoate.  
Ophthalmic examinations 
Ophthalmic examinations were performed in the adult and adolescent long-term safety study 
(FFR102123; at baseline and week 12, week 24 and week 52) and in children with perennial allergic 
rhinitis in the 12-week efficacy and safety study (FFR30008; at baseline and week 12). In both studies, 
assessments included slit lamp and funduscopic examinations of the cornea, iris and lens; detection of 
subcapsular cataracts, retinal vascular abnormalities and glaucoma; measurements of intraocular 
pressure.  
The results from both studies were similar; there was no evidence for adverse effects of treatment with 
intranasal fluticasone furoate on thorough ophthalmic examinations. Most subjects had normal 
ophthalmic examinations at baseline and throughout the treatment period. Mean changes in 
intraocular pressure and funduscopic cup to disc percentage were small and similar between the 
treatment groups. Increased intraocular pressure was reported as an AE for three subjects in study 
FFR102123 and for four subjects in study FFR30008; all were considered to be of mild intensity 
(except for a moderate intensity for one subject in placebo group in FFR30008). Glaucoma was not 
reported as an adverse event in either study.   
HPA axis evaluation 
HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis function was assessed in five clinical studies (FFR20002, 
FFR100012, FFR20001, FFR102123 and FFR30008). In two of these studies, FFR20002 (6-week 
HPA-axis study; adults and adolescents) and FFR100012 (6-week HPA-axis study; children 2 to <12 
years of age), serial serum samples and urine were collected over 24 hours to determine 24-hour serum 
cortisol and 24-hour urine cortisol excretion. The primary objective of these two studies was to assess 
the effects of 6 weeks treatment with fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110mcg once daily on HPA-axis

function compared to vehicle placebo nasal spray in male and female subjects with perennial allergic 
rhinitis. In FFR20002, prednisone (10mg once daily) was included as an active control during the 
last 7 days of treatment to ensure the assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect a drug effect. This 
active control arm of prednisone was not included in study FFR100012 due to ethical concerns over 
the suppression of adrenal function in children. The conclusions from the two HPA-axis studies 
suggest there is a very low potential for adverse effects related to HPA axis function with 
intranasal fluticasone furoate. In study FFR20002, at week 6 geometric mean serum cortisol 
concentrations were similar for fluticasone furoate 110mcg once daily and placebo (236.26 and 236.85 
nmol/l respectively). Geometric mean ratios from baseline at week 6 were similar for the fluticasone 
furoate and placebo treatment groups (0.99 for placebo, 0.97 for FF, 0.49 for prednisone group). In 
FFR20002, a summary of 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion showed similarities between the placebo 
and fluticasone furoate 110mcg once daily treatment groups. In study FFR100012, geometric mean 
ratios from baseline at week 6 were similar for both treatment groups (0.979 for placebo and 0.935 for 
FF).  
Data from the three other clinical studies (FFR20001, FFR102123 and FFR30008), in which 24-hour 
urine collections to evaluate urinary cortisol excretion were completed, supported the results from the 
two  HPA-axis  studies;  urine  cortisol  excretion  was  similar  for  subjects  treated  with  intranasal 
fluticasone furoate and with placebo.  
As expected for intranasal corticosteroids, the risk of adverse events related to the potential 
pharmacological systemic effect of intranasal fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110mcg once daily 
appears to be very low.  
Growth assessment 
Study FFR101747 (knemometry study) was conducted to assess any potential effect on lower-leg 
growth rate from treatment with intranasal fluticasone furoate 110mcg once daily compared with 
placebo in children ages 6 to 11 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis/perennial allergic rhinitis. The 
primary safety endpoint was the mean growth rate in lower leg length over a 2-week treatment period.  
The applicant’s conclusion, that intranasal fluticasone furoate is unlikely to have a clinically relevant 
effect on lower-leg growth is accepted.  
The following preautionary wording has been added to SPC section 4.4: 
“Growth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed 
doses. It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal 
corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of 
reducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of 
symptoms is maintained. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a 
paediatric specialist (see section 5.1).” 
The package leaflet has been adapted accordingly. 
•  Safety in special populations 
AEs were assessed in subgroups of the overall intent-to-treat population (i.e., by age, race, sex, 
ethnicity and geographic region) in the adult and adolescent studies and in the paediatric studies. No 
clinically relevant differences were observed in any of the subgroups. 
There are no data with intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic impairment. A study of a 
single 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment resulted in increased Cmax (42 %) and AUC(0-∞) (172 %) and a modest (on average 23 
%) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects. From this study the average 
predicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol. Therefore moderate 
hepatic impairment is not predicted to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. 
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore no dosage recommendation can 
be proposed in this patient population. 
Other than the HPA/growth studies (described above) the applicant has not done special studies in 
special populations other than those with hepatic impairment. However, there is no particular issue 
which requires addressing.

•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is potential for increased exposure to fluticasone furoate when co-administered with a CYP3A4 
inhibitor, and hence increased potential for systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression.  
In study FFR10013, there was some evidence for an increase in systemic exposure on co-
administration of fluticasone furoate 110mcg once daily with ketoconazole, compared to placebo, 
because fluticasone furoate was quantifiable in 6 out of 20 subjects after ketoconazole, compared with 
only 1 out of 20 subjects after placebo.  However, the level of systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate 
in the ketoconazole group was below levels that would be expected to lead to suppression of cortisol 
secretion.  There was no clear evidence in this study that healthy subjects tolerated the combination of 
nasal inhalation of fluticasone furoate and oral ketoconazole less than administration of fluticasone 
furoate alone. 
Co-administration of fluticasone furoate and the highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not 
recommended based upon a multiple dose, crossover drug interaction study with fluticasone 
propionate (another intranasal corticosteroid, which is also a substrate of CYP3A4). In this study, co-
administration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate resulted in a significant increase in plasma 
fluticasone propionate exposure and a significant decrease in plasma cortisol area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve (AUC).  Therefore, there is potential for increased exposure to 
fluticasone furoate when co-administered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and hence increased potential for 
systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression. 
The applicant has agreed with the CHMP request for additional information in SPC section 4.4 
(Special warnings and precautions for use) and Section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products 
and other forms of interaction).   As enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no 
theoretical basis for anticipating metabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the 
cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses, no 
clinical studies have been conducted to investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The number of withdrawals due to adverse events was low during the clinical development program 
for intranasal fluticasone furoate.  
Overall, 18 subjects (12 from the placebo group and 6 from the FF group) withdrew from six studies 
in the adult and adolescent integrated database due to adverse events.  Six of the 12 subjects from the 
placebo group had adverse events of infections (viral gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis (2), 
pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection); two subjects withdrawn had seasonal allergy, one 
subject had both abdominal pain and nephrolithiasis, one subject had tendon rupture, one subject had 
back pain, and one subject had epistaxis. In the FF group four of six subjects were withdrawn due to 
infections (viral gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and viral infection); one subject had 
hypersensitivity to coconut and one 62-year old subject was withdrawn due to increased intraocular 
pressure diagnosed during a routine ophthalmic examination nine days after beginning treatment.  
In the long-term safety study FFR102123, 38 subjects (6%) in the fluticasone furoate nasal spray 
110mcg group and 7 subjects (3%) in the placebo group were withdrawn due to AEs (most frequently 
were reported epistaxis, asthma, headache, nasal septum ulceration and nausea). Epistaxis was the 
only AE that led to the discontinuation of more than 1% of subjects. This AE led to the withdrawal of 
15 subjects (2%) in the fluticasone furoate 110mcg group and no subjects in the placebo group. The 
majority of discontinuations due to epistaxis (10/15) occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment 
and only one subject was withdrawn after more than 6 months of treatment.  
In the paediatric integrated studies, 28 subjects (2%) were withdrawn due to AEs: 13 subjects (3%) in 
the placebo group, 10 subjects (3%) in the fluticasone furoate 55mcg group and 5 subjects (1%) in the 
fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group (most frequently were reported asthma and epistaxis).  
Twenty one subjects were withdrawn from 11 clinical pharmacology studies; the 5 withdrawals 
attributed to an AE were: sore throat, transient hypotensive episode, abnormal liver enzymes, 
dizziness, abdominal pain.

•  Post marketing experience 
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray is commercially available in the USA since May 2007. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The most relevant clinical problem following intranasal administration of fluticasone furoate appears 
to be a low incidence of epistaxis and nasal ulceration; these are described in the SPC. To further 
complement the available data GSK has committed, as part of FUMs, to submit results (including 
biopsy data) from a study investigating the effects of one year of continuous treatment with FF nasal 
spray on the nasal mucosa of PAR subjects.  
At the request of CHMP, the applicant has added a warning statement with respect to Benzalkonium 
chloride to the Product Information, in line with the Guideline on excipients in the label and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
In response to the Day 120 LOQ, the applicant submitted additional analyses of the safety database for 
FF nasal spray regarding the possible adverse event of pyrexia. These confirmed that the slight 
increase in the proportion of children on FF reporting pyrexia in the clinical programme is not 
associated with upper respiratory tract infections, and there is no evidence for a dose-response effect. 
Furthermore the clinical presentation of the pyrexia events is not consistent with the characteristics of 
a drug-induced fever. CHMP agreed to the proposal from the applicant that the inclusion of pyrexia in 
section 4.8 of the SPC is not warranted, based on their commitment to specifically monitor reports of 
pyrexia in the post-licensing period.  CHMP will monitor this through PSURs and updates of the 
RMP. 
The low systemic availability means that the general metabolic and other unwanted properties of 
corticosteroids are unlikely to be a problem with this formulation used at the recommended dose. 
Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Based on the data submitted, moderate 
hepatic impairment is not expected to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. 
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore no dosage recommendation can 
be proposed in this patient population, and caution is advised when treating these patients (SPC 
section 4.4).  
Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. At the request of CHMP the applicant has 
modified the proposed wording in SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5. The final wording is as follows: 
-SPC Section 4.4  
“Ritonavir 
Concomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased 
systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate (see section 4.5).” 
-SPC Section 4.5  
“Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. In a drug interaction study of intranasal 
fluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there were more subjects with 
measurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the 20 subjects) 
compared to placebo (1 out of 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a 
statistically significant difference in 24 hour serum cortisol levels between the two groups (see section 
4.4).” 
In the FF clinical development programme for FFNS, patients with asthma who required inhaled or 
oral corticosteroids were excluded. Nevertheless, further to published case reports of adults and 
children who developed signs of hypercortisonism after use of cumulative doses of other inhaled 
(intranasal and intrabronchial) steroid, this potentially important issue has been addressed in the SPC 
and PL.  
The following wording was agreed for SPC section 4.4 :  
“As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of corticosteroids should be 
considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently. “

hepatic impairment. There are no data in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(see section 4.4 and 5.2). 
SPC Section 4.4 
Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive 
first-pass metabolism, therefore the 
systemic exposure of intranasal 
fluticasone furoate in patients with severe 
liver disease is likely to be increased. This 
may result in a higher frequency of 
systemic adverse events (see section 4.2 
and 5.2). Caution is advised when treating 
these patients.” 
SPC Section 5.2 
Hepatic Impairment:  
There are no data with intranasal 
fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic 
impairment. A study of a single 400 
microgram dose of orally inhaled 
fluticasone furoate in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment resulted in 
increased Cmax (42 %) and AUC(0-(cid:31)) 
(172 %) and a modest (on average 23 %) 
decrease in cortisol levels in patients 
compared to healthy subjects. From this 
study the average predicted exposure of 
110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone 
furoate in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment would not be expected to 
result in suppression of cortisol. Therefore 
moderate hepatic impairment is not 
predicted to result in a clinically relevant 
effect for the normal adult dose. There are 
no data in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. The exposure of fluticasone 
furoate is likely to be further increased in 
such patients. 
Warning in SPC section 4.4 :  
“Treatment with higher than 
recommended doses of nasal 
corticosteroids may result in clinically 
significant adrenal suppression. If there is 
evidence for higher than recommended 
doses being used, then additional systemic 
corticosteroid cover should be considered 
during periods of stress or elective 
surgery.  Fluticasone furoate 110 
micrograms once daily was not associated 
with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis suppression in adult, 
adolescent or paediatric subjects. 
However the dose of intranasal 
fluticasone furoate should be reduced to 
the lowest dose at which effective control 
of the symptoms of rhinitis is maintained.

6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The results of in vitro pharmacodynamic studies indicate that FF exhibits anti-inflammatory activity 
which  is  similar  to  that  of  other  glucocorticoids  used  in  anti-inflammatory  therapy.  The  in  vitro 
potency  of  FF  in  terms  of  receptor  affinity,  receptor  selectivity  and  anti-inflammatory  activity  is  at 
least equal or better than the potency of previously approved glucocorticoids in AR therapy, such as 
fluticasone  propionate  and  mometasone  furoate.    Results  of  in  vitro  onset  and  duration  of  action 
studies, and in vitro tissue binding studies indicate that FF has promising clinical potential in respect 
of the very rapid glucocorticoid receptor activation (the maximum effect is observed after 20 minutes) 
and long duration of action (up to 30 hours). This characteristic has a positive impact on reduction of 
systemic  exposure  to  FF.    The  in  vivo  studies  support  the  opinion  that  the  in  vitro  profile  of  FF  is 
group-specific. These studies demonstrate that it is an effective, high affinity anti-inflammatory agent 
in  a  number  of  distinct  animal  models  of  inflammation.  Results  of  safety  pharmacology  studies 
indicate no significant adverse effects of FF, other than corticosteroid-specific.

The pharmacokinetic profile of FF was adequately examined. The collected data are sufficient for the 
assessment of FF for intranasal administration. In general FF pharmacokinetics is similar between the 
animal species tested and humans.  The pharmacokinetic behaviour of FF absorbed systemically after 
intranasal  administration  is  similar  to  that  following  oral  and  intravenous  administration.  Studies 
performed in dogs following intranasal administration indicate that systemic bioavailability of FF after 
intranasal administration is minimal (less than 1%); additionally, it is supported by a first past effect 
accompanied by an effective biotransformation to an inactive metabolite and rapid elimination.  There 
is no appreciable risk of  FF accumulation after intranasal  administration at the proposed therapeutic 
dose.  The  toxicology  studies  performed  by  the  applicant  covered  single  dose  toxicity,  repeat-dose 
toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  and  development  toxicity,  local  tolerance  and 
other toxicity studies. 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  FF  was  administered  by  oral, 
intravenous and inhalation routes. The results of single dose studies in mice and rats (high doses of FF 
administered orally, intravenously or by inhalation, producing measurable systemic exposure) showed 
the effects typical for excess of glucocorticoids i.e. reduction of body weight and lymphoid depletion. 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies FF was administered by the inhaled route (mice, rats, dogs) and 
by the intranasal route (rats, dogs). The battery of multiple dose inhalatory and intranasal toxicology 
studies  of  FF  administered  to  mice,  rats  and  dogs  revealed  a  range  of  findings  class-specific  to 
glucocorticoids.  These  findings  were  typically  associated  with  systemic  exposure  to  glucocorticoids 
and commonly reported for other marketed intranasal steroids. Local effects observed in the long-term 
intranasal  studies  suggest  acceptable  level  of  safety.  The  safety  profile  of  the  product  is  well 
documented  and  supported  by  the  series  of  properly  planned  and  completed  studies.  Comparative 
toxicokinetic data obtained from  animal and human  studies showed that intranasal  administration of 
FF  at  the  proposed  doses  produces  no  measurable  systemic  exposure  to  FF  and  the  occurrence  of 
systemic glucocorticoids activity is unlikely. 
Efficacy 
The clinical development has demonstrated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate in the treatment of the 
symptoms of SAR and PAR.   
In  the  SAR  studies  FF  nasal  spray  demonstrated  statistically  significant  reductions  from  baseline 
compared with placebo for the primary endpoint (daily rTNSS) over the entire treatment period.  The 
results for the primary endpoint were supported by the key secondary efficacy endpoint AM pre-dose 
iTNSS.  This  confirmed  that  once-daily  administration  of  fluticasone  furoate  maintained  the 
improvement  in  nasal  symptoms  of  SAR  until  the  end  of  the  24-hour  dosing  interval.    Similar 
improvements  were  seen  for  AM  and  PM  rTNSS  suggesting  consistent  daytime  and  night  time 
symptom relief.  No individual nasal symptom disproportionately influenced the composite score for 
rTNSS  and  the  resulting  overall  treatment  difference  over  placebo.  Across  the  studies,  scores  for 
subjects treated with fluticasone furoate 110mcg were significantly better than placebo, with a large 
proportion  reporting  moderate  to  significant  improvement  in  this  group  compared  with  placebo 
(integrated analysis results: 52% and 30%, respectively).  Fewer subjects receiving fluticasone furoate 
reported  moderate  or  significant  worsening  compared  with  those  receiving  placebo  (integrated 
analysis  results:  3%  and  12%,  respectively  a  significant  positive  effect  on  ocular  symptoms  was 
observed) in 4 out of 4 studies in SAR. 
The  overall  findings  from  the  PAR  studies  were  that  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110mcg  was 
effective  in  improving  the  nasal  symptoms  and  that  once  daily  administration  of  fluticasone  furoate 
nasal spray adequately maintains the improvement in nasal symptoms of PAR until the end of the 24-
hour  dosing  interval.  The  treatment  effect  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  statistically 
significant  over  placebo.  The  primary  efficacy  results  were  supported  by  the  data  from  the  key 
secondary endpoints.  
Safety 
Safety data were collected from the six short-term adult and adolescent phase 3 studies.  The majority 
of SAR and PAR studies were 2 - 12 weeks in treatment duration, and thus approximately 80% of the 
subject exposures were 12 weeks or less. 
©EMEA 2008 
49/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the safety database of 3954 subjects, 501 (25%) of the subjects (adults and adolescents) exposed to 
fluticasone furoate 110mcg once daily were exposed to treatment for a period of ≥6 months and 400 
(20%) adult and adolescent subjects were exposed for ≥12 months.  
The  largest  number  of  subjects exposed to fluticasone furoate 110mcg in the clinical development 
program was in the 18 to <65 year age group; 1333 of these subjects were treated with the 110mcg 
dosage.  
In the adolescent population (aged 12 to <18 years), 198 subjects were exposed to fluticasone furoate 
110mcg in the clinical studies.  
In  the  paediatric  phase  3  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  (subjects  ≥2  to  <12  years  of  age),  176 
subjects 2 to <6 years of age were treated with the 110mcg or 55mcg dosages of fluticasone furoate 
and 618 paediatric subjects 6 to <12 years of age were treated with the 110mcg or 55mcg dosages. 
54 of these subjects were ≥2 to 4 years of age and were treated with either a 55mcg or 110mcg dosage 
of fluticasone furoate nasal spray.  
The most relevant clinical problem following intranasal administration of fluticasone furoate is a low 
incidence of epistaxis and nasal ulceration; these are described in the SPC. To further complement the 
available data GSK has committed to submit results (including biopsy data) from a study investigating 
the  effects  of  one  year  of  continuous  treatment  with  FF  nasal  spray  on  the  nasal  mucosa  of  PAR 
subjects (as listed in  2.7 FUMs following the Marketing Authorisation). 
The  low  systemic  availability  means  that  the  general  metabolic  and  other  unwanted  properties  of 
corticosteroids are unlikely to be a problem with this formulation used at the recommended dose. 
Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
as  an  increase  in  systemic  exposure  cannot  be  ruled  out.  At  the  request  of  CHMP  the  applicant  has   
modified existing wording to SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5 
Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Based on the data submitted, moderate 
hepatic impairment is not expected to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. 
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore no dosage recommendation can 
be  proposed  in  this  patient  population,  and  caution  is  advised  when  treating  these  patients  (SPC 
section 4.4).  
In  the  FF  clinical  development  programme  for  FFNS,  patients  with  asthma  who  required  inhaled  or 
oral  corticosteroids  were  excluded.  Nevertheless,  further  to  published  case  reports  of  adults  and 
children  who  developed  signs  of  hypercortisonism  after  use  of  cumulative  doses  of  other  inhaled 
(intranasal and intrabronchial) steroid, this potentially important issue has been addressed in the SPC 
and PL.  
The following wording was agreed for SPC section 4.4 (Special warning s and precautions for use) :  
“As  with  all  intranasal  corticosteroids,  the  total  systemic  burden  of  corticosteroids  should  be 
considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently.” 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  
•  User consultation 
The applicant has provided the User testing of Avamys to demonstrate readability and usefulness of 
the patient information leaflet to patients. The results of the user consultation were satisfactory and no 
further re-testing was requested at the time of the CHMP Opinion.

Risk-benefit assessment 
FF is a synthetic glucocorticoid with proposed use as a topical anti-inflammatory compound in allergic 
rhinitis (AR) therapy. The idea of FF use is  consistent with extensive clinical  experience with other 
approved  glucocorticoids  administered  as  nasal  spray  in  local  therapy  of  AR.  The  pharmacological 
profile of FF is well defined. Its mode of action is typical for corticosteroids. FF exhibits potent anti-
inflammatory activity.  
During the Oral Explanation held during the September CHMP meeting, the applicant addressed the 
outstanding issues, in particular the indicated age range for children, lack of clinical study with active 
comparator, SPC wording. 
Based on the data provided on quality, efficacy and safety (as discussed above) and further to the oral 
explanation by the applicant (and clarifications after the oral explanation), the CHMP concluded that 
FF has a positive benefit risk ratio in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and over . 
For the age group 2 up to 6 years, CHMP considered that the number of patients in this age group (176 
exposed  to  FF)  and  the  lack  of  a  clear  dose  response  relationship  do  not  allow  concluding  that  the 
efficacy and safety of this medicinal product in such a population has been sufficiently established. 
Further to the applicant’s presentation regarding feasibility and methodological limitations of active-
comparator  studies  with  other  intranasal  corticosteroids,  and  because  the  results  provided  from 
placebo-controlled studies were sufficiently convincing, CHMP did not pursue this point as a follow-
up measure. 
The applicant agreed with the CHMP request to simplify and shorten the indication wording, in line 
with  the  Guideline  on  SPC;  the  description  of  symptoms  (including  the  effect  on  ocular  symptoms) 
was moved to SPC section 5.1. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Avamys  27.5  micrograms  nasal  spray  suspension  in  the 
treatment  of  “the  symptoms  of  allergic  rhinitis”  was  favourable  in  adults,  adolescents  (12  years  and 
over)  and  children  (6  –  11  years)”  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing 
authorisation.

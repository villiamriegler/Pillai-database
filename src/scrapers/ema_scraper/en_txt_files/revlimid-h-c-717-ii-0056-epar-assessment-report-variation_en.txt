2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the disease 
Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of acquired clonal hematopoietic stem cell 
disorders that are characterised by anaemia, varying degrees of other cytopenias, and dysplasia 
usually in the presence of normocellular or hypercellular bone marrow (BM). They are primarily a 
disease of the elderly with a median age of onset between 65 and 76 years. The incidence of MDS in 
Europe and the US is approximately 3 to 4/100,000 per year and rises sharply above the age of 60 
years, reaching up to 50/100,000 per year. The incidence of MDS is greater in men than in women. 
Based on the available epidemiologic information, deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q 
deletion or del (5q) lesion), partial or complete, is present in 10% to 15% of patients with primary 
MDS and is the most frequently documented cytogenetic abnormality in MDS. The median age at 
diagnosis of MDS del (5q) is between 65 and 70 years and there is a female preponderance with a 
male to female ratio of 1:1.5. 
Tumour protein 53 (p53) mutation is a well-recognized poor prognostic factor in high-risk MDS and 
AML, although p53 mutation has only recently been reported to be present in 20% to 25% of patients 
with low-risk MDS and del (5q) as detected via genomic sequencing. 
Anaemia is the most common manifestation of MDS and is present in approximately 90% of MDS 
patients at the time of diagnosis. Elevated percent BM blasts reflecting the potential for increased 
proliferation and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are present in 20% to 30% of patients 
at diagnosis but can increase over time due to disease progression. The majority of MDS patients 
develop a requirement for RBC transfusions which is often severe in patients with the deletion 5q (del 
5q) cytogenetic abnormality. 
The haematopoietic insufficiency and cytopenias of MDS lead to potentially serious morbidity 
(transfusion-dependent anaemia, bleeding manifestations, and infections) and mortality primarily as a 
consequence of infection or bleeding caused by BM failure. 
Repeated transfusions may cause secondary haemochromatosis due to iron overload, resulting in 
increased risk of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Transfusion-dependent anaemia has also been shown to be a risk factor for progression to AML and 
reduction of overall survival (OS). 
The only potentially curative approach that currently exists for treating MDS patients is allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). But because of morbidity/mortality and the lack of a 
suitable donor in older patients, this approach is only employed in younger patients with higher-risk 
disease.  
As multiple transfusions are associated with morbidity such as secondary haemochromatosis and 
reduced health related quality of life (HRQoL), transfusion-dependent anaemia resulting from

ineffective haematopoiesis is the principal therapeutic challenge for patients with low- and intermediate 
1 (INT-1)-risk MDS. 
Other than transfusion support and iron chelation, the treatment options for low- or INT-1-risk MDS, 
include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) (EPO or darbepoetin-α) alone or in combination with 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine; 
immunosuppressive therapies such as antithymocyte globulin or cyclosporin A. There are currently no 
treatments generally approved in EU for patients with low/INT-1 MDS. Moreover, these agents are 
generally ineffective in patients who require ≥ 2 RBC transfusions per month. 
About the product 
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulating agent. It is the lead member of a group of compounds known 
as the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). 
The lenalidomide mechanism of action includes anti-neoplastic, anti-angiogenic, pro-erythropoietic and 
immunomodulatory properties. Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of certain haematopoietic 
tumour cells (including multiple myeloma (MM) plasma tumour cells and those with deletions of 
chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the 
number of NK T cells, inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells 
and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin production by CD34+ haematopoietic 
stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. 
Lenalidomide has shown direct cytotoxicity and/or anti-proliferative effects on the MDS del (5q) clone. 
In addition, lenalidomide induces apoptosis through inhibition of cytokinesis. Moreover, 
proerythropoietic effects, immunomodulatory properties, and antiangiogenic activities of lenalidomide 
are also of relevance for MDS pathogenesis. 
Lenalidomide was designated as an orphan medicinal product, EU/3/04/192, on 8 March 2004, for the 
following indication: Treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.  
Revlimid (lenalidomide) has been granted a marketing authorisation on June 2007 through the 
centralised procedure in the indication “Revlimid is indicated in combination with dexamethasone for 
the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have received at least one prior therapy”. 
The scope of this variation is to add the following new indication to Revlimid (lenalidomide): 
Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or 
intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. 
Revlimid treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer 
therapies. 
Lenalidomide treatment must not be started with Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC) < 0.5 x 109/l 
and/or platelet counts < 25 x 109/l. 
The recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 10 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 
28-day cycles. Dosing is continued or modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
The proposed new myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) indication will require the use of Revlimid 10 mg 
strength for initial recommended dose and 5 mg, and 2.5 mg strengths for dose reduction steps.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support this type II variation, the non-clinical dossier was updated to present the pharmacology of 
lenalidomide with particular emphasis on the mechanism of action (MOA) in del(5q) MDS. The 
nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicology data submitted and approved for lenalidomide in multiple 
myeloma (MM) also supports the use of lenalidomide in MDS. Therefore, the MAH cross-referred to the 
existing nonclinical PK and toxicology data previously submitted for approval of the MM application. In 
addition, an updated Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The MAH submitted 65 published articles and 1 MAH-sponsored study to support the use of Revlimid 
for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk 
MDS associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality.  
In MDS (del (5q)), lenalidomide was shown to selectively inhibit the abnormal clone by increasing the 
apoptosis of del (5q) cells. The sensitivity to lenalidomide in MDS del (5q) can, at least in part, be 
explained by the up-regulation of several tumour suppressor genes (e.g. SPARC, p21, RPS14) which 
have reduced expression due to haplo-insufficiency caused by del (5q). 
(1)  Antineoplastic effects 
The ability of lenalidomide to induce complete cytogenetic responses in patients with del(5q) MDS 
(Ades, 2009; Fenaux, 2009; List, 2006) is most likely due to its ability to target the del(5q) clone 
directly. The antineoplastic effects of lenalidomide against chromosome 5-deleted hematopoietic 
tumours have been reported for del(5q) MDS patient cells (Gaidarova, 2008; Pellagatti, 2007; Ramsay, 
2008), del(5q) AML patient cells (Wei, 2009), and various other hematopoietic tumour cell lines 
harbouring deletions in chromosome 5 (Gandhi, 2006). The mechanism of this tumoricidal activity in 
general involves cell cycle arrest in G0–G1 and/or G2– M phases, followed by apoptosis. Common 
features include the induction of tumour suppressor genes and the inhibition of genes or proteins 
required for cell cycle progression and proliferation. 
Lenalidomide was shown to inhibit the growth of differentiating del(5q) erythroblasts from MDS 
patients, but did not affect cytogenetically normal cells from healthy donors (Pellagatti, 2007). A report 
evaluating baseline and post-treatment bone marrow cells of del(5q) MDS patients treated with 
lenalidomide demonstrated increased apoptosis in CD34+ del(5q) progenitor cells, with a concomitant 
expansion in erythroid progenitors (Ximeri, 2010). An increased expression of adhesion molecules on 
the remaining CD34+ cells was observed post-treatment, as well as increased soluble stromal derived 
factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) and inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), suggesting recovery and 
maintenance of the CD34+ cells through interactions between the hematopoietic and stromal cells. 
Thus, a significant component of the effects seen with lenalidomide on del(5q) cells is due to selective 
growth inhibition and direct cytotoxicity against the malignant clone. 
Lenalidomide inhibited proliferation of various hematopoietic tumour cell lines with deletions in 
chromosome 5, including Burkitt’s lymphoma, Namalwa, AML KG-1, AML UT-7, and the TALL Loucy cell 
lines (Gandhi, 2006). In Namalwa cells, G0–G1 cell cycle arrest is associated with induction of the 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor tumour suppressor p21WAF-1, thereby causing inhibition of 
CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, and subsequent reduction in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein 
(pRb), resulting in an inability to enter cell cycle S phase (Verhelle, 2007). The mechanism of p21WAF-
1 gene induction was found to be dependent on demethylation of histone H3 protein by lysine-specific 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 8/123 
 
 
  
 
demethylase-1 (LSD-1) (Escoubet-Lozach, 2009). Demethylation of histone H3 allows transcription 
factor binding to the GC-rich binding site on the p21 promoter for Sp-1 and early growth response 
(EGR) family members, including EGR1 and EGR2 (Escoubet-Lozach, 2009). Indeed, suppression of 
EGR1 expression in Namalwa cells caused a reduction in p21 expression. As EGR1 is encoded within 
the chromosome 5q31 locus, this mechanism of p21 induction would be sensitive to deletions in 5q31 
with haploinsufficiency of the EGR1 gene. The effects of lenalidomide on EGR1 and other genes 
encoded on chromosome 5q are described below. 
(2)  Effects on genes in the 5q deleted regions 
SPARC, or osteonectin, functions as a tumour suppressor gene in many malignancies. It has 
antiproliferative, anti-adhesive and anti-angiogenic effects, and is located in chromosome 5q31–32 
(Barker, 2005; Chlenski, 2006; Framson, 2004). Homozygous knockout of SPARC in mice induced 
thrombocytopenia, reduced haemoglobin, and decreased erythroid colony formation (Lehmann, 2007). 
The decreased expression of SPARC, due to hemizygous deletion, is thought to play a role in the 
phenotype of 5q− syndrome. The effect of lenalidomide treatment on gene expression was studied in 
intermediate erythroblasts isolated from del(5q) MDS patients. The tumour suppressor gene SPARC 
was upregulated 4-fold in erythroid and non-erythroid cells from MDS patients; however, it was also 
increased in cells from patients with MDS without del(5q). Expression levels of SPARC in del(5q) clones 
were about half that of controls, suggesting that upregulation of SPARC by lenalidomide may correct a 
deficiency in these cells, resulting in an antiproliferative effect (Pellagatti, 2007). Knockdown 
experiments using small interfering RNA to SPARC led to significant resistance to lenalidomide 
treatment, further indicating that the antiproliferative effects of lenalidomide may be due in part to the 
upregulation of SPARC (Zhang, 2008). 
Cdc25C and PP2A are phosphatases that regulate the cell cycle at the G2–M stage. Gene expression of 
these enzymes was shown to be lower in MDS and AML cells with del(5q) compared with those with 
alternate karyotypes. In order to mimic the haplodeficiency found in del(5q) cells, short hairpin RNA 
technology was used to reduce the Cdc25C and PP2A gene expression in U937 and primary non-
del(5q) MDS cells. In cells in which Cdc25C and/or PP2A genes were knocked down, reduced 
expression of the phosphatases promoted sensitisation to lenalidomide. Lenalidomide was shown to 
inhibit the phosphatase activity, causing G1 and G2–M cell cycle arrest and an increase in apoptosis 
(Wei, 2009). These data indicate that decreased expression of these phosphatases in 5q deletions 
contributes to the preferential sensitivity of del(5q) MDS cells to lenalidomide (Wei, 2009). 
EGR1 is a transcription factor that regulates key target genes, such as transforming growth factor beta 
1 (TGFβ1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and p53, (Baron, 2006) suggesting a crucial role 
in tumour suppression. Additionally, it has been reported to regulate proliferation and localisation of 
bone marrow stem cells (Min, 2008). In a study of Burkitt’s lymphoma cells with chromosome 5 
monosomy, lenalidomide induced nuclear transport and transcriptional activation of EGR1 in a dose-
dependent manner (Gandhi, 2007). The activity was possibly related to the level of EGR1 expression, 
which may explain why del(5q) clones are particularly sensitive to lenalidomide. In the del(5q) MDS 
cell line MDS-L, EGR1 expression was increased 11.5-fold by lenalidomide treatment (Matsuoka, 
2010). Lenalidomide has also been shown to induce expression of EGR1 in multiple myeloma (MM) cell 
lines and patient-derived MM cells (Gandhi, 2010). Therefore as observed with SPARC, EGR1 induction 
by lenalidomide was not restricted to cells with defects in chromosome 5. However, the tumour-
suppressive effects of such gene induction events may be greater in cells with haploinsufficiency for 
these genes. 
DIAPH1 encodes mDia1, which acts as a significant integrator of multiple 5q gene products. The mDia 
family of formins is tightly regulated by a Rho-controlled mechanism and act as a major template for 
Revlimid II 56

actin polymerization and generation (Goode, 2007). Newly generated actin filaments provide the 
underlying structures that drive changes in cell morphology in order to facilitate events as divergent as 
cell division, intracellular trafficking, and chemotaxis (Chhabra, 2007). Lenalidomide has been shown 
to selectively activate RhoA and Rac1 within minutes following drug exposure, resulting in enhanced F-
actin formation and relocalization of membrane proteins (Gaidarova, 2009; Xu, 2009). These effects 
have been shown to be associated with restoration of immune synapse formation and T cell activation 
(Ramsay, 2008; Xu, 2009). T cell responses in the mDia1 knockout mice were studied and it was 
shown that Factin assembly necessary for the immune synapse formation requires mDia1 (Eisenmann, 
2007). Presently, the specific effects of lenalidomide on mDia1 and how these effects may play a role 
in the activity of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS are unknown. 
Kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A) is normally expressed during cell cycle M phase, required for 
cytokinesis, and located on chromosome 5q31. In the del(5q) MDS cell line MDS-L, lenalidomide 
inhibited expression of KIF20A and other cell cycle M phase proteins, including non-muscle myosin 
heavy-chain 10, polo-like kinase 1, aurora kinase B, and citron kinase (Matsuoka, 2010). In MDS-L 
cells, lenalidomide inhibited cytokinesis, arrested cells in M phase, induced polyploidy and 
multinucleated cells, and caused apoptosis (Matsuoka, 2010). 
Two microRNAs (miR-145 and miR-146a) located in the ~1.5 Mb commonly deleted region on 
chromosome 5q were shown to be decreased in bone marrow cells from individuals with del(5q) MDS 
(Starczynowski, 2010). Toll–interleukin-1 receptor domain–containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and 
tumour necrosis factor receptor–associated factor-6 (TRAF6) have been identified as the targets of 
miR-145 and miR-146a, respectively. To determine whether the lenalidomide response of myeloid cell 
lines was dependent on the deletion of 5q, the sensitivity to lenalidomide was evaluated in a panel of 
cell lines (MDS-L, KG-1, KG-1a, UT-7, and THP-1) with varied del(5q) status (BCCA-052010Karsan). 
Following 48 hrs of treatment with lenalidomide (10 μM), miR-145 was upregulated in the del(5q) cell 
lines, MDS-L and HL-60, but not in the other cell lines, including the del(5q) cell line KG-1a. MicroRNA-
146a was not significantly regulated. In addition to miR-145, miR-143 and miR-16 were uniquely 
upregulated in MDS-L and HL-60 cells. While the miRNA response to lenalidomide did not correspond 
to the del(5q) status in all cell lines, the miRNA response to lenalidomide did correlate with growth 
arrest/cell death induced by lenalidomide (BCCA-05, Karsan 2010).

Conclusion 
< 0.01 threshold 
Revlimid is currently authorised for the treatment of MM, and the present type II variation aims at 
extending the indication to MDS patients. The MAH calculated a Phase I PEC SURFACEWATER for each 
indication. The total phase I PECSURFACEWATER covering both indications is the sum of each individual 
PECSURFACEWATER. Default values were considered for WASTEWinhab (200 L/inh/day) and Dilution (10), 
whereas for each indication the MAH determined the DOSEai and Fpen parameters. 
(1)  Fpen determination 
The Fpen of lenalidomide for treatment of MM was considered to be 0.00023. The Fpen value for the 
MM indication is not documented at all. It corresponds to the prevalence of MDS cited in the EU orphan 
drug designation of lintuzumab (2.3/10,000 → Fpen = 0.00023). As such this value is not acceptable 
since it is not justified. According to Orphanet’s “Prevalence of rare disease: bibliographic data” 
published in November 20111, the prevalence of MM in Europe reaches 1.75/10,000. Therefore, a 
Fpen of 0.0002 could be used for MM indication. There is no data which indicate when 2 orphan 
indications are involved for the same product, the “default orphan Fpen” (0.0005) should not be taken 
into account for each indication. 
(2)  DOSEai determination 
The recommended maximal daily dose for the treatment of MM is 25 mg/day from days 1-21 of 
repeated 28-day cycles. For the treatment of MDS, the maximal daily dose reaches 10 mg/day to be 
administered from days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles. DOSEai values were obtained for each 
indication by averaging the doses over the 28-day period. More precisely: 
•  DOSEai MDS = 10 x (21/28) = 7.5 mg/day 
•  DOSEai MM = 25 x (21/28) = 18.75 mg/day

The PECSURFACEWATER is estimated to be 0.0033 μg/L, well below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L that 
triggers a Phase II assessment. Use of the standard action limit is not contraindicated by any specific 
concerns such as bioaccumulation (low Kow), or predicted atypical ecotoxicity (lenalidomide is not 
genotoxic, the NOAEL is the most sensitive species reached 1 mg/kg/day, and doses of 25 mg/day 
inducing Cmax values approximately 130,000-fold above the calculated PECSURFACEWATER are generally 
well-tolerated in patients. 
Even using a worst-case scenario with Fpen reaching 0.0005 for each indication, and non-averaged 
daily dose levels as DOSEai parameters (i.e. 25 mg/day and 10 mg/day for MM and MDS, 
respectively), the total PECSW would reach 0.0088 µg/L which is still lower than the action limit (0.01 
µg/L). Therefore, the predicted surface water concentration for lenalidomide indicates that its use in 
the proposed indication, in addition to the currently approved indication, should pose a negligible risk 
to the environment. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An extensive review of the pharmacology of lenalidomide was submitted by the MAH. Although the 
mechanism of action underlying the effect of lenalidomide is not fully characterised, the available data 
is considered as sufficient to establish proof-of-concept for the treatment of MDS del(5q) patients with 
lenalidomide. In MDS, Del 5q, lenalidomide was shown to selectively inhibit the abnormal clone by 
increasing the apoptosis of Del 5q cells.   
The MAH cross-refers to the existing nonclinical PK and toxicology previously submitted for the 
approval of the MM application. 
In view of the therapeutic indication, the lack of carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP at the time of approval. This is in line with the ICH S9 guideline which mentions that 
carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for the therapeutics intended to treat 
patients with advanced cancer.  However, there are clinical concerns related to the occurrence of 
secondary primary malignancies in patients (see section on Clinical Safety). The mechanism underlying 
these lesions is not known, although it is likely to be epigenetic since lenalidomide was shown to be 
non-genotoxic in an ICH-compliant battery of tests. Therefore, no further information is to be gained 
from conducting carcinogenicity studies in animals. 
Since exposure of MDS del(5q) patients to lenalidomide is not expected to be higher than that of MM 
patients, it is considered that cross-reference to the existing non-clinical data previously submitted for 
approval of MM application (notably pharmacokinetic, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and 
reproduction toxicity studies) is acceptable.  
Revlimid is considered to pose a negligible risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of lenalidomide.   
The main non-clinical findings are appropriately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 12/123 
 
 
  
 
The most important identified risk with lenalidomide related to non-clinical findings is that of 
teratogenicity. Based on the review of the data on nonclinical aspects, the following statements to 
address the potential risk of lenalidomide  in pregnant women have previously been included in section 
4.6 of the SmPC: 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. 
Lenalidomide induced in monkeys malformations similar to those described with thalidomide. 
Therefore, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide is expected and lenalidomide is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. 
Moreover, extensive additional risk minimisation activities including a pregnancy prevention 
programme, a controlled distribution system, a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication and 
patient cards are established in each EU member state prior to market launch of the medicinal product. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The present submission is based on one Phase 3 double-blind (DB) placebo-controlled study with an 
open-label (OL) phase (MDS-004); four Phase 2 OL studies (MDS-003, MDS-001, MDS-002, MDS-007), 
and one pharmacokinetic study (PK-002). MDS-004 and MDS-003 are considered the pivotal studies. 
MDS-001, MDS-007 and PK-002 are submitted as supportive studies. 
As this submission was made in support of the use of lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with 
transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or INT-1-risk MDS associated with a del (5q) cytogenetic 
abnormality, with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and MDS-002 enrolled MDS patients 
without the del [5q] abnormality), the data from MDS-002 were not included in the overall analysis of 
efficacy.  
The clinical formulations of lenalidomide (Revlimid 5 mg and 10 mg capsules) used in the MDS clinical 
studies are the same as the marketed formulations. The 5-mg and 10-mg lenalidomide capsules are 
approved and available. 
The new dosage strength, 2.5 mg capsule, has been developed for dose reduction in MDS patients. The 
2.5-mg lenalidomide capsule uses the same formulation as the currently approved 5 mg and 10 mg 
capsules. The in vitro dissolution profile of the 2.5 mg capsule is similar to that of the 5 mg and 10 mg 
capsules. The 2.5-mg lenalidomide capsules have demonstrated bioequivalence to the 5-mg 
lenalidomide capsules in humans (CP-010), but were not yet available for use in the clinical efficacy 
and safety studies in this submission. Based on the in vitro and in vivo biopharmaceutical evidence and 
the linear PK of lenalidomide, the plasma exposure of lenalidomide at the 2.5 mg dose is expected to 
be proportional relative to the higher doses.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
For the approved multiple myeloma (MM) indications, the normal dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg daily 
on day 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles. For the new MDS indication the recommended dose is 10 mg 
once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles.  
Revlimid is currently available as 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 25 mg capsules (the 7.5 
mg, 15 mg and 25 mg strengths are not intended for the MDS indication).  
The pharmacokinetic data discussed by the MAH within the current application aim primarily at 
describing the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in the new patient population and to support the 
proposed dose adjustment in renal impairment. The latter differs from the recommendations for the 
multiple myeloma indications due to the lower normal dose for the MDS indication and given the 
development of the 2.5 mg capsule.

Two clinical pharmacology studies specific for the MDS population have been submitted with the 
current application:  
-  Study CC-5013-PK-002, a multiple dose PK and PD study of lenalidomide in MDS patients 
-  Study CC-5013-MDS-007, a multiple dose study to evaluate PK, efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide in Japanese MDS patients 
In addition, the MAH discusses data that have been previously submitted and assessed from:  
-  CC-5013-DMPK-007, Ex vivo protein binding of lenalidomide in plasma from patients with 
different renal function status 
-  CC-5013-PK-001, a study of lenalidomide in renal impairment   
-  CC-5013-PK-005, a single-dose, PK and safety study in Japanese vs. Caucasian healthy 
volunteers  
Methods 
a.  Analytical methods 
R- and S-lenalidomide concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by validated chiral liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. R- and S-lenalidomide 
concentrations in dialysate were measured using a non-validated LC-MS/MS method. Protein binding of 
lenalidomide was determined using a non-GLP intraday validated ultrafiltration and LC-MS/MS method. 
b.  Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Non-compartmental methods were used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters in the studies 
referred to in the current application. As the ratio between the R- and S-enantiomer has previously 
been shown to be unaffected by dose level, the pharmacokinetic parameters presented in the body of 
the study reports were for total (R+S) lenalidomide, although concentrations for the separate 
enantiomers had been determined.  
c.  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The table below summarises lenalidomide pharmacokinetic data from studies in different patient 
populations with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min:

Table 2. Comparison of lenalidomide single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters across studies 
Two studies on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in MDS patients have been submitted with the 
current variation application. One study was performed in mainly Caucasian patients and the other in 
Japanese patients.  
a)  Study CC-5013-PK-002 
This was a phase 1/2, open-label, single-centre, single arm, multiple-dose study primarily aiming at 
evaluating the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS. The 
study included 25 patients (23 Caucasians, 1 Caucasian/Asian, and 1 Caucasian/Hispanic). Twelve (12) 
patients received a single 10 mg dose of lenalidomide on Day -7. Twenty-four (24) patients, including 
11 treated on Day -7, received multiple doses of lenalidomide, which began at a starting daily dose of 
10 mg on Day 1 and continued with dose adjustment after Day 14. Serial sampling of blood and 
collection of total urine were performed after dosing for 24 hours on Day -7 and for 5 hours on Day 14. 
Afterwards, blood samples were collected at predose and 1 hour postdose every 28 days. On the PK 
visit days, the patients were dosed under fasted conditions. 
Following a single 10 mg oral dose, lenalidomide was rapidly absorbed and eliminated, with the median 
tmax occurring around 1 hour postdose and the mean t1/2,z being approximately 4 hours. Urinary 
excretion of unchanged lenalidomide in 24 hours postdose averaged approximately 65% of the 
administered dose. 
Multiple dosing (10 mg QD for 14 days) did not cause lenalidomide accumulation in plasma, with the 
limited 5-hour pharmacokinetic profile on Day 14 comparable to that observed at a single dose 
(Day -7). In 11 patients treated on both Days -7 and Days 1 to14, mean drug accumulation ratios, as 
measured by comparing the Cmax and AUC5hr values of Day -7 and Day 14, were close to 1. In 
addition, mean dose-normalised plasma lenalidomide concentrations at 1 hour postdose were relatively 
stable for up to 280 days. 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 16/123 
  
 
 
  
 
In the subjects with mild renal impairment (50 ≤ CLcr ≤ 80 mL/min; N=7), the mean drug exposure 
(Cmax and AUC∞) after a single dose was approximately 50% higher compared with the patients with 
normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min; N=5). However, after multiple dosing for 14 days, 
significant difference was not observed in the limited 5-hour pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide between 
the two groups of MDS patients. In two patients with moderate renal impairment (30 ≤ CLcr < 50 
mL/min), the 5-hour exposure (AUC) on Day 14 was increased by more than 70%, compared with the 
patients with normal renal function. 
Overall, the study demonstrated rapid absorption and elimination of lenalidomide as well as a lack of 
lenalidomide accumulation in plasma upon repeated administration of daily 10 mg lenalidomide dose to 
MDS patients. These characteristics are consistent with those observed in previous studies in healthy 
patients. Mild RI appeared to have a negligible effect on the multiple-dose exposure of lenalidomide 
while moderate RI increased this exposure considerably. 
b)  Study CC-5013-MDS-007 
This was a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single arm, multiple-dose study conducted to evaluate the 
safety, PK, and efficacy of lenalidomide in Japanese patients with low- or intermediate-1- risk MDS. 
Patients were administered lenalidomide at 10 mg QD on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. The 
pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was assessed in seven patients during the first five days of the 
treatment. Fasting prior to dosing was not required in this study. Serial sampling of blood was 
performed after dosing for 24 hours on Days 1 and 4 and at predose on Day 3. 
Following lenalidomide administration, the median tmax was approximately 2.5 and 2.9 hours on Days 
1 and 4, respectively. The slightly longer Tmax value in this study, as compared with Study CC-5013-
PK-002 above, was suggested due to the non-fasting condition in this study.  
Multiple doses (10 mg, QD x 4 days) did not cause lenalidomide accumulation in plasma, with the 
mean plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC tau) comparable to that observed at a single dose. On both 
Days 1 and 4, lenalidomide was rapidly eliminated from the plasma with a mean t1/2,z of 3.3 to 3.6 
hours and a mean CL/F of 190 mL/min. In addition, there was no meaningful difference in Vz/F of 
lenalidomide between Day 1 and Day 4. 
In conclusion, the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in Japanese MDS patients was 
characterised by rapid elimination and a lack of drug accumulation, which was similar to that observed 
in Caucasian patients.  
2.4.2.1.  Special populations 
a)  Impaired renal function 
The previously submitted study CC-5013-PK-001 in renal impairment (RI) was a single-dose study in 
30 subjects (otherwise healthy) that were recruited into five different groups: Normal renal function 
(CLcrea >80 ml/min), mild RI (50-80 ml/min), moderate RI (30-49 ml/min), severe RI (< 30 ml/min 
but not on dialysis) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Subjects with normal renal 
function, mild, moderate or severe RI received a single 25-mg oral dose of lenalidomide under fasting 
condition on Day 1 of the study. Subjects with ESRD received two single 25 mg doses which were 
separated by at least 7 days. One dose was given on a non-dialysis day. The other dose was given on 
a dialysis day, 3 hours before a 4-hour haemodialysis period. 
The results demonstrated that the differences in exposure between normal renal function and mild RI 
groups were minor to modest (<32%). Patients with moderate and severe RI had on average an 2.6-
fold and 3.5-fold increase in AUC, a 3-fold increase in t1/2,z, and a 65% to 74% decrease in CL/F 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 17/123 
 
 
  
 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. On a non-dialysis day, patients with ESRD had a 
4.8-fold increase in AUC, 4.8-fold increase in t1/2, and an 80% decrease in CL/F compared to subjects 
with normal renal function. The mean dialysis clearance was estimated to be 146 mL/min. As a result, 
the percentage of lenalidomide in the body removed by a 4-hour hemodialysis was 31%. The t1/2,z 
value was unchanged on dialysis days compared to non-dialysis days (~16 hours) (Table 3 and 4).  
Table  3.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  (geometric  mean  and  CV%)  for  total  lenalidomide  in 
renally impaired subjects after a 25 mg dose (Study CC-5013-PK-001) 
Urinary excretion of unchanged total lenalidomide was mostly completed by 24 hours postdose in all 
groups of subjects. Thus, the urine collection period was adequate in subjects with varying RI. 
Subjects with normal renal function had higher mean % dose excreted unchanged (85%), followed by 
subjects with mild RI (69%), subjects with moderate RI (42%), and subjects with severe RI (44%). 
Subjects with ESRD were not included in this analysis as they were anuric.

Table 4. Geometric mean ratio (90% CI) for lenalidomide exposure between renal function 
groups 
Highly significant linear relationships were observed between AUC∞, AUCt, t1/2,z, CL/F, or CLr, and 
the measured CLcr. CL/F and CLr decreased as the measured CLcr declined (Figure 1). Linear 
regression of CL/F and CLr against the measured CLcr produced similar slopes (1.85 and 1.89, 
respectively). Consistent with the changes in lenalidomide clearance, AUC∞, AUCt, and t1/2,z 
increased with decreasing CLcr. There were no relationships between Cmax or Vz/F and the measured 
CLcr determined.

pharmacokinetic parameters

The AUC ratio between the S- and R-enantiomer appeared to increase slightly with worsening of renal 
function (Table 5).  
Table 5. Effects of renal impairment on the exposure to the separate R- and S-enantiomers 
of lenalidomide 
The ex vivo protein binding in plasma samples from this study, as determined by ultracentrifugation at 
37ºC, was 40.15 ± 4.50, 35.37 ± 4.06, 37.16 ± 6.34, 39.77 ± 6.27 and 44.31 ± 3.92 in subjects with 
normal renal function, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and end-stage renal disease, 
respectively. Thus, it was concluded that renal impairment did not significantly affect protein binding of 
lenalidomide.  
b)  Dosage recommendations 
For the approved multiple myeloma (MM) indications, the normal dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg daily 
on day 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles. Based on the data from study CC-5013-PK-001, no dose 
adjustment is recommended for mild renal impairment, while a reduction by 60% to 10 mg daily at 
moderate impairment, by 70% to 15 mg every other day at severe impairment and by 80% to 5 mg 
daily in ESRD on dialysis is recommended. For moderate and severe impairment the dose may be 
escalated to 15 mg daily and 10 mg daily, respectively, if the patient tolerates the treatment .  
For the MDS indication the normal recommended dose is 10 mg once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 
28-day cycles. The MAH proposes a reduction by 50% to 5 mg daily in moderate RI, and by 75% to 
2.5 mg daily in severe RI and ESRD (Table 6).

Page 20/123 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Table 6. Dosage recommendations for lenalidomide at renal impairment in patients with 
multiple myeloma (previously approved recommendation) and MDS (proposed 
recommendation) 
Lenalidomide displays linear pharmacokinetics in both healthy volunteers and MM patients. Although 
dose proportionality was not determined in MDS patients, data analysed across studies suggest that at 
comparable renal function there is no difference in lenalidomide pharmacokinetics between MM and 
MDS patients. 
The steady-state plasma lenalidomide concentration-time profiles under the daily 7.5 or 2.5 mg dosing 
regimen were simulated using nonparametric superposition principle. The predicted lenalidomide 
exposure levels (AUC and Cmax) at steady-state were subsequently estimated from the simulated 
steady-state concentration-time profiles by non-compartmental analysis.  
The simulation suggests that the steady-state daily AUC at 2.5 mg once daily in MDS patients with 
severe renal impairment (836 ng•h/mL) or end stage renal disease (1121 ng•h/mL) is close to that at 
10 mg once daily in patients with CLcr ≥ 50 mL/min (957 ng•h/mL) (Table 7).

c)  Race 
Study CC-5013-PK-005 was an ascending single-dose, PK and safety study in Japanese and Caucasian 
healthy volunteers. This study was previously submitted but is briefly mentioned here, as it was 
discussed in the MAH’s Clinical Summary supporting the MDS indication. A total of 18 healthy subjects 
were enrolled in 2 groups consisting of 9 Caucasian subjects and 9 Japanese subjects. Within each 
group of 9 subjects, 7 received lenalidomide and 2 received matching placebo. After an overnight fast, 
each subject received 5, 10, and 20 mg single oral doses of lenalidomide (given as multiples of 5 mg 
capsules) or matching placebo on 3 occasions that were separated by a washout period of at least 5 
days. Serial sampling of blood was performed after each dose for 48 hours. Lenalidomide was rapidly 
absorbed and eliminated, with the Cmax being reached at a median time of 0.5 to 1 hour and t1/2,z 
being approximately 2.5 hours. The concentration-time profiles for the Japanese and Caucasian 
subjects were similar for all three lenalidomide dose levels. There were no statistically significant 
differences (p >0.05) in the pharmacokinetic parameters between Japanese and Caucasian subjects at 
each dose level. Cmax and AUC∞ increased proportionally with doses from 5 mg to 20 mg in both 
ethnic groups. 
The S/R enantiomer ratio was similar across dose levels, but appeared to be somewhat lower in 
Japanese than in Caucasian subjects (Table 8).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Lenalidomide is suggested to have a pleiotropic MOA, which includes direct cytotoxicity/apoptosis 
and/or antiproliferative effects on the del (5q) clone, pro-erythropoietic effects, immunomodulatory 
properties, anti-angiogenic activities, and antineoplastic properties. 
The efficacy analysis of PK-002 study is based upon data from a small subset of patients (N = 7). 
Lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg QD (continuous regimen) was effective in inducing an erythroid 
response in patients with low- or INT-1-risk MDS associated with a del (5q) cytogenetic lesion. 
There was a relatively rapid onset of erythroid response (within the first 2 cycles) and the response 
was durable. These data are consistent with the observations of the primary and supportive MDS 
studies. In addition, the erythroid response rate (major or minor) achieved during the subsequent 
phase (Combined Treatment Phase, in combination with rhu-EPO) was 50%, suggesting that 
lenalidomide plus rhu-EPO can induce an erythroid response in MDS del (5q) patients who fail to 
respond to lenalidomide alone or who relapse following prolonged lenalidomide monotherapy.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Rapid absorption and elimination of lenalidomide as well as a lack of accumulation in plasma upon 
repeated administration of 10 mg lenalidomide daily dose has been demonstrated in MDS patients. 
These characteristics are consistent with those observed in healthy subjects. Mild RI appeared to have 
a negligible effect on the multiple-dose exposure of lenalidomide while moderate RI increased this 
exposure considerably. These results supported a starting dose adjustment in MDS patients with 
moderate or greater RI. 
Across-study analyses demonstrate that renal function is the most important intrinsic factor affecting 
PK of lenalidomide in MDS patients. Effects of different disease settings, age, or gender on systemic 
exposure (AUC) of lenalidomide are insignificant at comparable renal function, suggesting MDS 
patients do not need dose reductions simply because of their disease, age, or gender. In addition, 
there is no racial difference in lenalidomide PK between Caucasian and Japanese healthy volunteers as 
well as between Caucasian and Japanese MDS patients. 
A starting dose adjustment is not recommended for MDS patients with mild RI (CLcr = 50-80 mL/min). 
A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for MDS patients with moderate RI, severe RI, and 
ESRD, because the plasma lenalidomide exposure was increased significantly and the rate of SAEs 
tended to increase at CLcr <50 mL/min. The dose adjustment for these patients aims at approximating 
the daily AUC at the steady-state following administration of daily 10 mg lenalidomide to patients with 
CLcr ≥50 mL/min. The proposed starting doses for these patients are predicted by simulation to reach 
the targeted AUC range. 
For dose reduction in MDS patients, the 2.5-mg QD dose and the 2.5-mg every other day dose are 
proposed to replace the step-down dose regimens of 5 mg every other day and 5 mg twice a week, 
respectively. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme of Revlimid was considered acceptable. 
The  recommended  starting  dose of  lenalidomide is 10  mg  orally  once  daily  on  days  1-21  of  repeated 
28-day  cycles.  Dosing  is  continued  or  modified  based  upon  clinical  and  laboratory  findings.  Dose 
adjustments,  as  summarised  below,  are  recommended  to  manage  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  or 
thrombocytopenia, or other grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide.

Return to ≥ 0.5 x 109/l 
Recommended Course 
Interrupt lenalidomide treatment 
Resume lenalidomide at next lower dose 
level (Dose Level -1, -2 or -3) 
For other grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide,  treatment should be stopped 
and restarted at next lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ grade 2 depending on the 
physician’s discretion. 
Lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for grade 2 or 3 skin rash. 
Lenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, and should not be resumed 
following discontinuation from these reactions. 
Patients without at least a minor erythroid response within 4 months of therapy initiation, 
demonstrated by at least a 50% reduction in transfusion requirements or, if not transfused, a 1g/dl 
rise in haemoglobin, should discontinue lenalidomide treatment. 
The pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was studied in subjects with renal impairment due to 
nonmalignant conditions. In this study, two methods were used to classify renal function: the urinary 
creatinine clearance measured over 24 hours and the creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-
Gault formula. The results indicate that as renal function decreases (< 50 ml/min), the total drug 
clearance decreases proportionally resulting in an increase in AUC. The AUC was increased by 
approximately 2.5, 4 and 5-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment, severe renal impairment, 
and end-stage renal disease, respectively, compared to the group combining subjects with normal 
renal function and subjects with mild renal impairment. The half-life of lenalidomide increased from 
approximately 3.5 hours in subjects with creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min to more than 9 hours in 
subjects with reduced renal function < 50 ml/min. However, renal impairment did not alter the oral 
absorption of lenalidomide. The Cmax was similar between healthy subjects and patients with renal 
impairment. Approximately 30% of the drug in the body was removed during a single 4-hour dialysis 
session. Dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function were recommended as follows:

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  studies  supporting  the  efficacy  of  lenalidomide  at  a  starting  dose  of  10  mg  once  daily (QD)  on 
Days  1  of  21  of  each  28-day  cycle  (cyclic  regimen)  for  the  treatment  of transfusion-dependent 
anaemia due to low- or INT-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or 
without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, are summarised as follows:  
Pivotal studies: 
MDS-003 (including long-term follow-up as part of the extension 
protocol MDS-003E/MDS-009) 
MDS-004 
Supportive studies: 
MDS-001: Phase II dose-finding study also aiming at identification of 
subpopulations of patients with MDS who respond to lenalidomide 
Other study: 
PK-002: Phase I/II clinical pharmacology study 
MDS-007: Single arm study in Japanese patients 
Additional supportive data are provided by the available post-marketing data and national off-label use 
Named Patient Programmes. 
Ongoing  MDS-005  study:  Multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-
group Phase  3  study  of  lenalidomide  vs  placebo  in  patients  with  RBC  transfusion-dependent 
anemia due  to 
low-  or  INT-1-risk  MDS  without  del  (5q)  and  unresponsive  or  refractory 
to erythropoietin-stimulating agents (99 patients randomised). As this study is ongoing and the study 
remains  blinded,  data  are  not  included  in  the  application,  with  the  exception  of  the  description  of  4 
reports of second primary malignancies (SPMs).  
The MDS-002 study evaluated the efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with RBC transfusion-dependent 
anemia due to low- or INT-1-risk MDS without an associated del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality. Clinical 
data  have  revealed  differences  in  outcome  in  MDS  patients treated  with  lenalidomide,  depending  on 
the  presence  or  absence  of  a  del  (5q)  cytogenetic abnormality;  therefore,  the  MDS-002  study  is 
provided in support of safety only.

Table 9. Overview of Studies  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The lenalidomide doses of 10 mg and 5 mg were selected based on the results of phase 2 studies 
(MDS-001 and MDS-003) which showed that a dose of 10 mg once daily was a safe and effective initial 
dose regimen, when administered either daily for 21-of-28 day cycles, or for 28-of-28 day cycles.  
The 10-mg dose using the 21-of-28 day cycle was chosen because grade 4 neutropenia was reported 
less frequently with this regimen, while the RBC-transfusion independence rate was still comparable to 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 26/123 
 
 
 
  
 
that for the 28-of-28 day cycle regimen (Study MDS-003).  Study MDS -001 also demonstrated that 
this dose and regimen of lenalidomide produced erythroid responses in patients with low- to 
intermediate -1 risk. 
The lower 5-mg dose (using the 28-of-28 day cycle) was included to refine the dosing schedule and 
determine whether this lower starting dose/regimen would be sufficient to provide adequate benefit, 
with potentially lesser toxicity. 
MDS-001 
13 patients were initially treated with lenalidomide 25 mg QD, a dose that was chosen based on the 
findings of an earlier Phase 1 study of lenalidomide in patients with MM (CDC-501-001). However, 
while this dose of lenalidomide produced major erythroid responses in 30.8% of patients within 16 
weeks, a significant percentage of patients (31%) could not tolerate more than 30 days of continuous 
exposure to 25 mg lenalidomide. For this reason the protocol was amended and an additional 32 
patients were enrolled to explore a reduced dose of 10 mg QD under continuous (12 patients) and 
cyclic (20 patients) regimens. A total of 42% and 33% of patients in the ITT population achieved a 
major erythroid response under the continuous and cyclic regimens, respectively. All responders had 
IPSS low- or INT-1-risk MDS and the majority (69.2%) of patients who achieved a major erythroid 
response had the del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality. Overall, the results of this study suggested that 
lenalidomide, administered at a dose of 10 mg QD, under either a continuous or cyclic regimen, was 
an effective treatment for patients with low- or INT-1-risk MDS and an associated del (5q31-
33) cytogenetic abnormality. The MDS-001 data prompted the initiation of MDS-003.

years. 
•  Use of any other experimental therapy within 28 days of the first day of study lenalidomide 
treatment. 
Treatments 
Patients received treatment with 10mg of lenalidomide orally once daily. 
The protocol initially employed a syncopated dosage regimen of 10 mg lenalidomide taken orally once 
daily on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. 
The protocol was subsequently amended to employ a continuous dosage regimen in which 10 mg of 
lenalidomide was taken orally once daily without a planned rest period.  
Patients who began therapy on the syncopated regimen and who did not experience dose-limiting 
adverse events (AEs) were allowed to switch to the continuous regimen after initiation.  
Dose reductions were made based on the severity and type of the AEs that occurred; dose escalation 
above 10 mg daily was not allowed. 
Treatment continued until unacceptable AEs occurred, bone marrow disease progression was 
documented, progression or relapse following erythroid improvement was documented, or for a 
maximum of 24 cycles, whichever occurred first. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  lenalidomide  for  achieving  hematopoietic  improvement  in  patients 
with an IPSS (Greenberg, 1997) diagnosis of low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a 
del 5 (q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
to evaluate the safety of lenalidomide in this patient population  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
RBC-transfusion independence, defined as the absence of an intravenous infusion of any RBC 
transfusion during any consecutive 56 days during the treatment period (eg, Days 1 to 56, Days 2 to 
57, Days 3 to 58, etc), accompanied by at least a 1 g/dL increase from screening/baseline in Hgb. 
The 1 g/dL increase from screening/baseline in Hgb only had to be measured once at any point during 
the 56 day period of RBC-transfusion independence. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included:  
• 
• 
Frequency of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in RBC transfusion requirements 
over any consecutive 56 days during the evaluation period;  
duration of response (transfusion independence), as determined by IWG criteria;

• 
• 
time to response (transfusion independence);  
platelet response; 
neutrophil response;  
bone marrow response (improvement and progression); 
cytogenetic response. 
Sample size 
In the design of the protocol, a 1-stage hypothesis-testing model was used to estimate a sample size 
that would provide adequate statistical power to determine if the treatment was worthy of further 
study. When applying this design, the largest proportion that would suggest that the drug not be 
studied further was set to be 30%, and the smallest proportion that would suggest that the drug is 
worthy of further study was set to be 60%.  
In the 1-stage design selected for this study, a sample of 30 patients who completed 6 cycles or 
dropped out early was adequate to test response rates of 30% versus 60% with acceptable error rates.  
For an N of 30 patients, an exact 2-sided 95% CI for the observed response rate will fail to include 
30% at least 80% of the time if the true percentage of patients who become RBC-transfusion 
independent is 60%. Recognizing that 30 patients, while meeting the statistical requirements, would 
not provide enough information to adequately assess safety, additional patients were studied both to 
provide additional safety data and also to provide more precise estimates of the response rates. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed on the MITT population, which included all patients who 
met all of the following conditions: 
•  Had a diagnosis of low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a del (5q31-33) 
cytogenetic abnormality based on confirmation by the central hematologic and cytogenetic 
reviewers 
•  Received at least 2 transfusions in each of the 8-week periods during the 16 week pre-
treatment period. In addition, patients were not to have been transfusion-free for any 56 
consecutive days during the 16-week pre-treatment period. 
•  Received at least 1 dose of study medication 
Response rates (number and percentage of patients) together with 2-sided exact 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were provided for all study endpoints based on categorized responses.  
Kaplan-Meier estimates were provided for duration of response for those patients who became RBC-
transfusion independent. If a patient who responded had not received an RBC-transfusion at the time 
of analysis, then duration of response was censored at the time of last follow-up.

Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], minimum [Min], maximum [Max]) were provided 
for the transfusion requirements at baseline, time to response, and duration of response, as well as 
observed values and changes from baseline for relevant laboratory parameters used in the 
determination of response, including in particular Hgb concentration. Paired t-tests (or nonparametric 
analogues) were to be used to test the significance of changes from baseline.

Recruitment 
The study (period from 24 July 2003 to 27 August 2008 (date of data cut-off)) was conducted at 32 
study sites in the United States and I study site in Germany. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 6 amendments of the study protocol (data not shown).  
The following change from the analyses described in the clinical study protocol was made in this study: 
•  An efficacy evaluable population was defined in the protocol; however, this analysis population 
was not used in the statistical analysis of the data from this study, as this is very similar to the 
MITT population. The efficacy evaluable population was defined as a subset of the MITT 
population, i.e., those patients who met all the requirements for whom response could be fairly 
assessed, that is patients who withdrew from the study before completing 6 cycles for non-
treatment related reasons without responding were not to be included in the denominator used 
in the response estimates. Patients who withdrew for treatment related reasons (AEs, lack of 
response based on clinical judgment) were to be categorised as non-responders in this 
analysis. 
• 
The criteria for the eligibility of patients for the analysis of cytogenetic response were updated 
during the course of the trial. In the SAP, patients were eligible to be evaluated for a 
cytogenetic response if at least 2 abnormal metaphases were observed at baseline; in the 
updated eligibility criteria for this assessment, patients were eligible to be evaluated for a 
cytogenetic response if ≥ 20 metaphases were analysed at baseline.

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (ITT population) 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the ITT population were broadly similar to those of the 
MITT population.  Twenty-one (14.2%) patients’ IPSS scores were missing (unable to assign) at 
baseline and 9 (6.1%) patients in total had intermediate-2- or high-risk MDS at baseline according to 
the central review.  Twenty (13.5%) patients’ FAB classifications could not be classified by the central 
hematologic reviewer at baseline.  One (0.7%) patient had acute leukemia at baseline according to the 
FAB classification performed by the central reviewer; however, according to the assessment performed 
by the investigator at one Site  this patient had RAEB at screening/baseline and was eligible to be 
enrolled in the study. 
In the ITT population, 110 (74.3%) patients had an MDS clone with an isolated del 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality, 25 (16.9%) patients had intermediate cytogenetic complexity (del 5q abnormality plus 1 
additional cytogenetic abnormality), and 12 (8.1%) patients had complex cytogenetic abnormalities 
(an MDS clone with a del 5q abnormality and more than 1 additional cytogenetic abnormality).  One 
patient’s cytogenetic complexity was unknown at baseline. 
Numbers analysed 
The safety and ITT populations were used for the safety analysis, whereas the MITT and ITT 
populations were used for the efficacy analysis.  
The ITT population included all enrolled patients (n=148). The Safety population included all patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the analyses of safety (n=148). Finally, 
the MITT population used for the primary efficacy analyses included 94 patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The main efficacy results are summarised in the following Table 15. Additional efficacy results are 
presented under the MDS-004 study.

Extension Study (CC-5013-MDS-003E/CC-5013-MDS-009) 
CC-5013-MDS-003E/CC-5013-MDS-009 was a non-interventional, multicentre, follow-up extension 
study, which was conducted specifically to provide further long-term outcomes as regards overall 
survival/vital status and the possible occurrence of progression to AML for all patients previously 
enrolled in the MDS-003 study, and to further analyse these outcomes based on the long-term follow-
up data obtained. 
Incidence of Progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
One patient was diagnosed by the central cytogenetic reviewer as having AML at entry to the MDS-003 
study (baseline); hence, this patient was excluded from the progression to AML analyses (N = 147). 
The median duration of follow-up for all MDS-003 patients was 3.2 years (38.4 months; range:  0.3 to 
81.9 months).  Data on progression to AML are summarized in Table 16.

Classic 5q- syndrome yes/no was not included in the univariate analysis. In the subgroup analyses 
(data not shown) the classic syndrome had a relatively good prognosis AML 6/40 (yes) vs. 30/107 
(no). This difference was smaller than expected, and could be partly related to longer survival, death 
being a competing risk and perhaps also biased bone marrow sampling.  
Finally, Cytogenetic response was predictive of a lower rate of progression to AML (see Figure 4).

Overall Survival 
Of the 148 patients enrolled in the MDS-003 study, approximately two-thirds were dead at the time of 
follow-up  (101 patients;  68.2%).    Twenty-nine  (19.6%)  patients  were  alive  at  the  time  of  the  2010 
follow-up.    Vital  status  was  unknown  at  the  time  of  the  2010  follow-up  in  18  (12.2%)  patients  who 
were not included in the extension study follow-up cohort.  Survival information was obtained for all 54 
patients included in the 2010 MDS-003E/MDS-009 extension study.  Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall 
survival in all MDS-003 patients are presented in Table 18.

Overall Survival by Cytogenetic Response 
In all MDS-003 patients, 88 patients were evaluable for a cytogenetic response and 60 were not.  The 
majority of evaluable patients (63 patients; 71.6%) had a major or minor cytogenetic response, 
whereas 25 (28.4%) evaluable patients did not. 
Fewer patients who were cytogenetic responders had died at the time of follow-up (50.8%), compared 
with cytogenetic non-responders (80.0%) and those patients who were not evaluable for a cytogenetic 
response (81.7%).  In the subgroup analysis of RBC TI response (≥ 182 days) by cytogenetic 
response, the incidence of death was lowest in patients that achieved both a RBC TI response and a 
cytogenetic response (47.4%), and higher in patients that achieved neither a RBC TI nor a cytogenetic 
response (82.4%). 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival are presented for cytogenetic responders and cytogenetic 
non-responders in Table 18 (all MDS-003 patients).

Treatments 
1. Pre-randomisation phase (up to 8 weeks): 
Potential protocol-eligible patients were to enter the pre-randomisation phase after signing informed 
consent and were evaluated for the inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolment in the double blind 
treatment phase of this study.  
2. Double-blind (DB) treatment phase (up to 52 weeks): 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report

The double-blind treatment phase was to start (Day 1) within 3 days of randomisation, and could 
continue for up to 52 weeks (until Day 365 of the double-blind treatment phase). On Day 1, all 
patients began one of the following treatments: 
Lenalidomide 10 mg: Oral lenalidomide 10 mg (two 5 mg capsules) once daily on Days 1–21 and two 
placebo capsules once daily on Days 22 – 28, every 28 days. 
Lenalidomide 5 mg: Oral lenalidomide 5 mg (one 5 mg capsule) plus one placebo capsule once daily 
on Days 1-28, every 28 days. 
Placebo: Two placebo capsules once daily on Days 1-28, every 28 days. 
Study visits were to occur every 28 days (whether or not study drug had been interrupted for dose-
limiting toxicity [DLT]), and serial measurements of safety and efficacy were to be performed.  
The dose of lenalidomide or placebo was to be reduced if DLTs occurred, and CBCs were to be obtained 
weekly following the development of dose-limiting neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. The use of 
granulocytic growth factors were strongly encouraged for patients who developed febrile neutropenia 
or those who experienced ≥ grade 3 neutropenia (including those patients who had grade 3 
neutropenia at baseline). 
Patients who had evidence of at least a minor erythroid response after 16 weeks of treatment phase 
participation were able to continue therapy in the double-blind treatment phase for up to 52 weeks 
(Day 365 of the double-blind treatment phase) unless there was disease progression or erythroid 
relapse.  
Patients who did not have evidence of at least a minor erythroid response after 16 weeks of double-
blind treatment phase participation were to be discontinued from the double-blind treatment phase for 
lack of therapeutic efficacy, and unblinded.  
Patients discontinued from the double-blind treatment phase of the study for disease progression were 
not eligible for inclusion in the open-label extension phase. Patients who had an erythroid relapse 
following the achievement of at least a minor erythroid response were discontinued from the double-
blind treatment phase for lack of therapeutic efficacy and their assigned treatment arm was unblinded. 
Patients who completed the total duration of 52 weeks in the double-blind treatment phase without 
disease progression or erythroid relapse were unblinded after Week 52 and entered the open-label 
extension phase at their current dose of lenalidomide. 
3. Open-label (OL) extension phase (up week 156): 
Patients were to begin treatment in the open-label extension phase within 28 days of either completing 
or early discontinuation from the double-blind treatment phase.  
Study visits occurred every 28 days and serial measurements of safety and efficacy were performed. 
The dose of lenalidomide was reduced if DLTs occurred. 
Patients were permitted to continue lenalidomide therapy in the open-label extension phase for up to 
156 weeks of total study participation unless the following occurred:  
• 
• 
• 
at least a minor erythroid response was not achieved within 16 weeks of open-label extension 
phase treatment;  
disease progression developed, or 
the  RBC  transfusion  requirement  returned  to  baseline  in  the  absence  of  hypothyroidism  in 
female patients, or hypothyroidism and/or hypogonadism in male patients.

Patients who did not achieve at least a minor erythroid response within 16 weeks of open-label 
extension phase treatment, or who developed an erythroid relapse without low TSH (all patients) or 
testosterone (male patients only) levels following the achievement of a minor or major erythroid 
response, were treated as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
patients who started the open-label extension phase at the 10 mg dose level were discontinued 
from the study for lack of therapeutic efficacy;  
patients who started the open-label extension phase at the 5-mg dose level and who 
previously required a lenalidomide dose reduction were discontinued from the study for lack of 
therapeutic efficacy;  
patients who previously had tolerated lenalidomide at the 5-mg dose level without a dose 
reduction were permitted to escalate the dose of lenalidomide to 10 mg once daily on Days 1–
21 every 28 days.  
Patients who developed a decreasing blood haemoglobin (Hgb) level during a period of RBC transfusion 
independence were permitted to remain in the open-label extension phase until their RBC transfusion 
requirement returned to baseline (erythroid relapse). 
Patients who discontinued the study for any reason were to be followed every 4 months (directly via 
telephone or information obtained from their treating physician) for survival and/or to collect any 
events of progression to AML. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
To compare the efficacy of 2 doses (10 mg and 5 mg) of lenalidomide to that of placebo in 
patients with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent low- or intermediate-1-risk IPSS MDS 
associated with a deletion (del) 5q[31] cytogenetic abnormality. 
Secondary objectives: 
To compare the safety of 2 doses of lenalidomide (10 mg and 5 mg) to that of placebo in patients with 
RBC transfusion-dependent low- or intermediate-1-risk IPSS MDS associated with a del 5q[31] 
cytogenetic abnormality. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
Proportion of patients achieving RBC-transfusion independence for ≥182 days (6 months). 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included:  
• 
Erythroid response (classified as major and minor, according to International MDS 
Working Group Criteria) 
•  Duration of RBC transfusion independence, defined to be the number of days 
between the last transfusion prior to the start of the transfusion-free period and the 
first transfusion after the transfusion-free period 
•  Change of blood Hgb concentration from baseline in patients who achieved a major 
erythroid response 
• 
Erythroid response (major and minor according to International MDS Working Group 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 47/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Criteria) at one year of double-blind treatment phase participation. 
•  Change in platelet counts from baseline 
•  Change in absolute neutrophil counts from baseline 
•  Cytogenetic response (according to the International MDS Working Group Criteria) 
•  Bone marrow response (according to the International MDS Working Group Criteria) 
•  HRQoL assessments: the four components (Physical, Social/Family, Emotional and Functional 
Well-being), and total, of the 27-item FACT-G; the 13-item fatigue subscale; the total of the 
Additional Concerns; and the total of all items on the FACT-An (the FACT-G items plus the 
items under Additional Concerns and EQ-5D) (at initial visit only) 
•  Overall Survival (OS) 
• 
Time to progression to AML 
Sample size 
A two-group continuity corrected χ2 test with a 0.025 two-sided significance level (this ensures that 
the type I error rate for the two comparisons to the placebo arm is bounded above by 0.05 two-sided) 
was calculated to have 80% power to detect the difference between a response rate of 0.400 in the 
active treatment group and a response rate of 0.100 in the placebo group when the sample size in 
each group is 45 evaluable patients for the centrally-confirmed MITT population. 
Enrollment for the study was expanded from 162 patients to 205 in order to achieve the pre-specified 
135 evaluable patients. 
Randomisation 
Patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio by a validated 
interactive voice response system (IVRS) to receive one of three regimens.  
Randomisation was stratified according to karyotype of the MDS clone (IPSS karyotype score of 0 
versus score of > 0; ie, isolated del 5q[31] abnormality versus del 5q[31] abnormality plus at least 
one additional cytogenetic abnormality). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind.  
Statistical methods 
• 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed on the MITT population which included all patients with: 
a documented diagnosis of MDS that met IPSS criteria for low- to intermediate-1-risk disease 
and  had  an  associated  del  5q[31]  cytogenetic  abnormality,  confirmed  by  central  review  of  an 
evaluable bone-marrow aspirate/optional biopsy. 
•  RBC transfusion-dependent anemia defined as not having any 56 consecutive days (2 months) 
without a RBC transfusion within at least the immediate 112 days (4 months) prior to Day 1 of 
the Pre-Randomisation Phase 
• 
at least 1 dose of study drug taken.  
The primary comparisons of interest were the response rates of each of the active treatment groups to 
placebo during the double-blind treatment phase. A step-wise modified Bonferroni procedure was used 
to control the experiment-wide error rate. The Mantel–Haenszel procedure blocking by karyotype (IPSS 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 48/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
karyotype score of 0 versus greater than 0) was used to compare the response rates for 10 mg versus 
placebo and 5 mg versus placebo. 
The Mantel–Haenszel procedure was also used to compare the secondary response measures: 
erythroid, cytogenetic, and bone marrow response together with the number of patients with ongoing 
transfusion independence at one year following initiation of treatment.  
The Kaplan–Meier procedure was used to characterize the duration of response. Analyses of variance 
was used to analyze the changes in blood Hgb concentrations, platelet counts, and absolute neutrophil 
counts from baseline, and the changes in the components and total of the FACT-An HRQoL 
assessment, and the frequency with which transfusions were given. In these analyses, the average 
number of transfusions given over 56-day intervals prior to randomisation were compared to the 
averages over 56-day intervals during the double-blind treatment phase. 
Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the prognostic variables for AML-free survival (AML or 
death, whichever occurs first, will be counted as the event), AML progression and overall survival. A 
univariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the impact of the individual prognostic 
variables. After the potentially significant prognostic variables have been identified, a multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards model was used to simultaneously determine the impacts of the most important 
prognostic variables.

Numbers analysed 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included all patients that were randomised to one of the three 
study treatments (n=205). 
The Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) population, defined earlier, was the population for the 
primary efficacy endpoint (n= 139). 
The Safety population: includes all randomised patients who received any study drug or placebo 
(205). 
Outcomes and estimation (MDS 003 and MDS 004) 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  IWG  criteria  define  a  major  haematologic  response  as  a  sustained  improvement  of  at  least 8 
consecutive weeks (56 days). Red blood cell transfusion independence was thus defined as a period of 
at least 56 consecutive days during which no transfusions were given with the additional requirement 
that  the  untransfused  Hgb  concentration  increased  by  at  least  1  g/dL..  In  the  MDS-004  study, 
the primary efficacy endpoint extended the RBC TI period to ≥ 182 days. 
The  results  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  are  summarised  in  the  following  Tables  23-25  and

Change in Haemoglobin Concentration from Baseline 
Figure 8. Mean Haemoglobin Change from Baseline for Patients who Achieved Red Blood Cell 
Transfusion Independence (at least 56 days) in MDS-003 and the Double-blind 
Phase of MDS-004 (ITT Populations) 
The median increase in Hgb concentration from baseline was 5.6 g/dL (range: 2.2 to 40.7 g/dL) for the 
97 responders in the MDS-003 study and 6.4 g/dL (range: 1.8 to 10 g/dL) for the 42 responders in the 
10-mg lenalidomide treatment group in the MDS-004 study.  
The median Hgb increase for the 33 responders in the 5-mg lenalidomide treatment group in the MDS-
004 study was 5.3 g/dL (range: 1.5 to 8.6 g/dL), approximately 2-fold higher than that for the 5 
responders in the placebo group (2.6 g/dL; range: 1.5 to 4.4 g/dL). 
Improved and sustained Hgb levels were seen in responders in all active treatment groups. A larger 
median increment was seen in the 10 mg group (6.4 g/dL) vs the 5 mg group (5.3 mg/dL) in MDS-
004. 
IWG-defined Hematologic Improvement: Platelet and Neutrophil Responses 
Platelet response 
Of the 27 evaluable patients in the ITT population of the MDS-003 study, 4 (14.8%) achieved a major 
platelet response. In the MDS-004 study, major platelet responses were observed in 2 of 11 (18.2%) 
evaluable patients in the 5-mg lenalidomide group, in 1 of 9 (11.1%) evaluable patients in the 10-mg 
lenalidomide group, and in none of the evaluable patients (0%) in the placebo group.  
Neutrophil response 
Eighteen (34.6%) of the 52 evaluable patients in the ITT population in the MDS-003 study achieved a 
major neutrophil response. In MDS-004, 3 (10.7%) of 28 evaluable patients in the 5-mg lenalidomide

group, 4 (14.8%) of 27 evaluable patients in the 10-mg lenalidomide group, and 2 (12.5%) of 16 
evaluable patients in the placebo group had a major neutrophil response.  
Bone Marrow Response (per IWG criteria) 
Table 30. Bone Marrow Improvement in MDS-003 and MDS-004 (ITT Populations) 
BM improvement, partial or complete, was observed in 43% of patients in MDS-003 and in 19% in the 
10  mg  group  and  17%  in  the  5  mg  group  in  the  MDS-004  study.  BM  improvement  was  induced  in  a 
little less than 20% of patients under the 10 mg cyclic regimen. The  figures  given under the Placebo 
heading  refer  to  patients  in  the  placebo  group  in  the  ITT  population  following  crossover  to  OL 
lenalidomide treatment. 
Cytogenetic Response (per IWG criteria) 
Patients were eligible to be evaluated for a cytogenetic response if ≥ 20 metaphases were analysed at 
baseline during the 56-day period immediately preceding the first day of study drug intake and when ≥ 
20  metaphases  were  analysed  at  least once  at  post  baseline  visits  using  conventional  cytogenetic 
techniques.

In  the  10  mg  arm  major  and  minor  cytogenetic  responses  were  observed  in  30.0%  and  24.0%  of 
patients, respectively. The achievement of transfusion independence is not dependent upon complete 
elimination of the malignant clone since a proportion of patients achieved transfusion independence in 
the absence of a cytogenetic response.

The assessment of HRQoL using the FACT-An instrument was conducted using the MDS-004 
ITT population. Randomised patients who completed the baseline FACT-An assessment and 
the FACT-An assessment at 12 weeks were included in the DB change from baseline ANOVA analyses.

Statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements of 5.9 and 5.8 points in FACT-An total scores were 
observed by Week 12 for patients in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively. In terms of HR QoL, 
more robust results were seen with the 10 mg dose.  
Progression of Disease to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS-003 and MDS-004) 
The risk of progression to AML over time in RBC TI responders (≥ 182 days) and non-responders is 
presented for MDS-003 (ITT population, N = 147) in Figure 11, and for MDS-004 (patients randomised

Achieving RBC TI was not associated with an increased risk of progression to AML in either pivotal 
study. In both pivotal studies, achieving RBC TI (≥ 182 days) was associated with a delay in the onset 
of AML when compared to non-responders. The 2-year risk of progression to AML was 10.7% and 
10.1% for RBC TI responders in MDS-003 and MDS-004, respectively, compared to 30.6% and 23.5% 
for non-responders.

From the data cut-off of 31 Mar 2012 to the data cut-off of 26 Nov 2012, 1 additional patient (in the 
lenalidomide  10-mg  group)  had  progression  to  AML.  The  median  time  to  progression  to  AML  in  the 
lenalidomide  10-mg  group  was  25  months  (Table  33).  The  2-year  rate  for  progression  to  AML 
remained 12.3% in the 10-mg lenalidomide group, 21.2% in the 5-mg lenalidomide group, and 16.3%

CI = 12.7-44.6) for p53-positive patients (p = 0.004) (Figure 14). 
When a 2% cut-off was used, the 2-year cumulative incidence of progression to AML was 8.7% (95% 
CI = 3.5-16.8) in patients with p53-negative IHC status (ie, IHC < 2%) at baseline compared with 
26.3% (95% CI = 7.5-50.2) for p53-positive patients (p = 0.036).

Overall Survival 
The Kaplan-Meier OS curves of the first 52 weeks of study for patients in Study MDS-004 are 
presented by randomised treatment assignment in Figure 14. The first 52 weeks of study includes 
patients receiving treatment in the DB and OL phases as well as patients who have discontinued 
treatment and are being followed for long term outcomes. By Week 52, the median OS was not 
reached for any of the 3 treatment groups. There were no significant differences in OS between the 
placebo, 5-mg, and 10-mg treatment groups during the first 52 weeks of the study (p=0.2456).

Data Cutoff Date: 26 Nov 2012. 
The  median  duration  of  follow-up  for  overall  survival  for  the  patients  in  the  ITT  population  was 
approximately 36 months, with 35.9 months for placebo, 35.5 months for the 5 mg and 36.9 months 
for the 10 mg treatment groups, respectively.  
Overall,  when  assessed  by  the  ITT  analysis,  there  was  no  difference  in  overall  survival  across  the 
treatment  groups  (Figure  15),  although  the  placebo  group  included  54 patients  who  crossed  over  to 
receive  5  mg  after  Week  16  (see  disposition  chart).    During  the  first  16  weeks  of  the  study,  1of  67 
(1.5%), 1 of 69 (1.5 %) and 2 of 69 (2.9%) patients died in the placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg treatment 
groups.

TP53 mutational status on OS (MDS-004) (Safety Population) 
Using a 1% cut-off, p53-positive IHC staining at baseline was associated with reduced OS (median = 
2.4 years; 95% CI = 1.7-3.7) when compared with patients with p53-negative IHC status (median = 
4.3 years; 95% CI = 3.5-6.4; p = 0.0175, Figure 17). 
A consistent pattern was observed when a 2% cut-off was used: OS for patients with p53-positive IHC 
status was reduced (median = 1.8 years; 95% CI = 1.5-3.9) compared with p53-negative IHC status 
(median = 3.9 years; 95% CI = 2.9-5.3; p = 0.051).

Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of Results of Subpopulations 
Subgroup analyses were performed by baseline demographic characteristics, i.e., age, gender, race, 
and by baseline disease characteristics, i.e., baseline IPSS score, FAB classification, del (5q) status 
(baseline cytogenetics), and baseline transfusion burden.

Analysis of RBC TI (≥56 days) by Baseline Demographic and Disease Characteristics (ITT populations) 
Table 34. Analysis of RBC TI (≥56 days) by Baseline Demographic and Disease 
Characteristics (ITT populations) 
No significant differences according to age, gender, race, baseline IPSS score, or FAB classification 
were observed in the ITT or MITT populations. Generally, a numerically greater response was seen in 
females vs males (e.g. 68% vs 45% in the 10 mg group in MDS-004, p=0.107 (ITT)).  
Regarding IPSS, a numerically lower response rate was seen at the 5 mg level vs the 10 mg levels in 
the low and INT-1 risk categories. The risk categories INT-2 and high are not evaluable due to low 
patient numbers. 
The greatest response rates were seen in RA followed by RAEB and RARS with the 10 mg levels being 
numerically superior of the 5 mg level. The response rate in CMMoL is not evaluable due to low patient 
numbers.

Analysis of Red Blood Cell Transfusion Independence Response by Baseline Cytogenetics (ITT) 
There were no significant differences in responses to lenalidomide between patients with an isolated 
del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality and those with del (5q) plus one or more additional cytogenetic 
abnormalities in any of the treatment groups in the MDS-004 study although in the 10 mg dose group, 
the proportion of responders with an isolated del (5q) was higher than those with additional 
cytogenetic abnormalities. In the MDS-003 study, a larger proportion of patients with an isolated del 
(5q) achieved RBC TI compared to patients who had additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  
The proportion of RBC TI responders (≥182 days) in the combined lenalidomide population was 
statistically non-significantly higher in patients with an isolated del (5q) abnormality and in those 
with del (5q) plus one additional cytogenetic abnormality compared to those who had ≥ 2 
additional cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline (113 of 200 patients [56.5%] and 22 of 50 patients 
[44%] compared to 8 of 24 patients [33.3%], respectively).  
The proportion of RBC TI responders among isolated del (5q) patients with < 5% blasts at baseline 
was similar to those with ≥ 5% blasts at baseline (77 of 131 patients [58.8%] and 17 of 32 patients 
[53.1%], respectively).  
Cytogenetic Response by Baseline Cytogenetics (ITT) 
There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved 
cytogenetic responses in any of the treatment groups in both studies. 
In  the  combined  lenalidomide  population,  the  proportion  of  cytogenetic responders  was  59.2% 
(77/130) among patients with isolated del (5q), 62.5% (20/32) among patients with del (5q) plus one 
additional cytogenetic  abnormality,  and  28.6%  (4/14  patients)  among  patients  with ≥  2  additional 
cytogenetic abnormalities.  
The proportion of cytogenetic responders was 57.8% (52/90) among patients with less than 5% blasts 
at baseline and 54.2% (13/24) among those who entered the study with 5% or more blasts. 
TP53 status and cytogenetic response 
In the intent-to-treat analysis of all 3 arms combined, RBC-TI response ≥ 182 days  was achieved by 
30.0%  (9/30)  of  p53-positive  patients  and  36.4%  (20/55)  of  p53-negative  patients.  Among  patients 
who received lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg, RBC-TI response ≥ 182 days was achieved by 62.5% 
(5/8) of p53-positive patients and 52.0% (13/25) of p53-negative patients. Cytogenetic response (all 3 
arms combined) was achieved by significantly more p53-negative patients (18/35; 51.4%) than p53-
positive patients (3/21; 14.3%).

RBC TI (at least 182 days) by Treatment Group in MDS-004 
Figure 18. Subgroup Analysis of 182-days Transfusion Independence Response by 
Treatment Group 
Generally, in terms of RBC TI, the 10 mg cyclic dosing is favoured or not non-preferred. No subgroup 
in which the 5 mg continuous dose is superior is identified; the efficacy of lenalidomide according to 
baseline EPO levels is unknown. 
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
For MDS 003, an interim analysis was conducted on the data captured up until 15 Sep 2004, for which 
clinical study report (CSR) was dated 07 Mar 2005. This report is an update with a 27 august 2008 cut

Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide in patients who had an IPSS diagnosis of low- or intermediate-1-risk 
MDS associated with a del 5 (q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality and who had red 
blood cell (RBC)-transfusion-dependent anaemia. 
The protocol initially employed a syncopated dosage regimen in which 10 mg of 
lenalidomide was taken orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle, but 
was subsequently amended (Amendment 1, dated 27 Aug 2003) to employ a 
continuous dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken without a 
planned rest period (28 days/28). 
Treatment continued until unacceptable AEs occurred, bone marrow disease 
progression was documented, progression or relapse following erythroid 
improvement was documented, or for a maximum of 24 cycles, whichever occurred 
first.

Progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia − Studies MDS-003 and MDS-004 
In a Cox proportional hazard model comparing risk of progression to AML between the 2 cohorts 
without using left truncation, the same set of significant risk factors was identified: complex 
cytogenetics, baseline blast count, transfusion burden, and baseline hemoglobin (Table 37).

In the univariate analysis, the cumulative risk of progression to AML among patients in the MCR who 
were TD at initial diagnosis and TD patients in Studies MDS-003 and MDS-004 also were compared 
without left truncation using both the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Fine-Gray competing-risk 
estimator (with death as the competing risk).  
Two additional sensitivity analyses were performed to control for the influence of time from TD to 
treatment or enrollment in the MCR including (1) between newly diagnosed MCR patients who were TD 
at registry enrollment versus lenalidomide-treated patients diagnosed within 1 year of study entry  and 
(2) between newly diagnosed MCR patients who were TD at registry enrollment, newly diagnosed MCR 
patients who were transfusion independent at registry enrollment but with known date of first TD after 
registry enrollment, and lenalidomide-treated patients (data not shown). 
An extensive assessment was undertaken to evaluate the influence of known risk factors on the risk of 
progression to AML in the combined MDS-003/MDS-004 data sets. The influence of baseline 
cytogenetics is illustrated in the 2-year cumulative rates of progression to AML (see Figure 19). 
Patients with complex cytogenetics had the highest 2-year rate of progression to AML (38.6%; 95% CI 
= 20.2% − 65.2%).

Randomised to Lenalidomide in Study MDS-004 (Double-blind Phase,  Open-label 
Phase, and Follow-up Period) (ITT Populations) 
AML = acute myeloid leukemia; ITT = intent to treat. 
Notes: Time to progression to AML was calculated from the date of randomisation. Patient 0243010 was diagnosed 
by the central cytogenetic reviewer as having AML at entry to Study MDS-003 (baseline); hence, this patient was 
excluded from the progression to AML analyses. 
Study MDS-003: Follow-up was completed on 01 Oct 2010. 
Study MDS-004: Data cutoff date = 31 Mar 2012. 
Overall, the 2-year cumulative incidence of progression to AML from time of study entry was 
approximately 17% in both studies: 17.0% (CI = 11.4% – 24.9%) for the MDS-003 ITT population 
and 16.9% (CI = 11.2% – 25.0%) for patients randomised to lenalidomide in Study MDS-004. Based 
on a median duration of follow-up of approximately 3 years, the 2-year rate (from study entry) of 
progression to AML of 17.0% was observed in both studies (Figure 18) 
In Study MDS-004, lower 2-year cumulative rates of progression to AML (12.3% [95% CI = 6.0% – 
24.1%]) were observed when starting treatment with the 10-mg dose, a dose also associated with 
highest rates of both cytogenetic response and RBC-TI response (Table 38) 
Finally, for patients in Studies MDS-003 and MDS-004 who achieved either a cytogenetic response or 
RBC-TI response and who remained on treatment beyond 16 weeks, the 2-year cumulative rates of 
progression to AML were between 8.3% and 10.7%, and the 5-year cumulative rates were between 
25.4% and 33.5%. 
In contrast, the 2-year rates of progression to AML for patients who failed to achieve either cytogenetic 
response (19.7% – 25.7%) or attain RBC TI (23.5% – 30.6%)  were 2-fold to 3-fold higher. The rates 
of progression to AML in these non-responding patients who received limited exposure to lenalidomide 
(< 16 weeks) approached the 2-year progression to AML rate (33.3%) observed for the 11 placebo 
patients from Study MDS-004 who did not receive lenalidomide.

unlike the primary studies, which limits the extrapolability to the targeted population.

MDS-007 
This was a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK 
profile of lenalidomide in Japanese patients with an IPSS diagnosis of low- or INT-1-risk MDS 
associated with a del (5q) abnormality and symptomatic anaemia or RBC transfusion-dependent 
anaemia. The purpose of MDS- 007 was also to support the dosing regimen of 10 mg QD lenalidomide 
administered on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. 
All the patients enrolled in the MDS-007 study presented with the del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality at 
baseline. Even if patients included were exclusively Japanese, baseline characteristics were consistent 
with those of patients in the MDS-003 and MDS-004 studies but the small population size (11) is of 
limited information.   
All 11 (100%) treated patients were evaluable and achieved major erythroid responses (IWG-defined 
criteria, RBC TI ≥ 56 days during the treatment period associated with Hgb increase of > 2 g/dL 
compared with baseline Hgb). 
The median age of patients was 72 years, and the majority of patients were > 65 years of age 
(81.8%).  
MDS-001 and MDS-002 
In MDS-001 and MDS-002, the majority of patients were white. The MDS-007 study was conducted 
exclusively in Japanese patients.  
The majority of patients in the MDS-001 (55.6%) and MDS-002 (64.2%) studies were male, reflecting 
the predominance of non-del (5q) MDS patients in these studies. As in the MDS-003 and MDS-004 
studies, in the MDS-007 study where only del (5q) MDS patients were enrolled, the majority (63.6%) 
of patients were female patients.  
The median age of patients was 72 years in each study, and the majority of patients were > 65 years 
of age (71.1% in MDS-001, 76.3% in MDS-002).  
Duration of MDS was slightly shorter than in the primary studies (median duration ranging from 1.9 to 
2.1 years). 
MDS-001, 002 and 007 showed that lenalidomide is effective in producing major haematological 
responses (especially erythroid responses), RBC-transfusion independence in patients with low or 
intermediate-1-risk MDS. They allowed to orient the development towards a starting dose of 10 mg 
daily and to focus on subpopulation with del (5q) abnormality. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The present submission is based on one Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-
label phase (study MDS-004), four Phase 2  open label studies (studies MDS-003, MDS-001, MDS-002, 
and MDS-007) and one pharmacokinetic study (study PK-002). Results derive from the 2 primary 
studies MDS 003 and MDS 004.  
The standardised French-American-British (FAB) criterion has been used to classify subtypes of MDS at 
diagnosis. The internationally used index IPSS has been used to determine prognostic for overall 
survival and transformation to AML. The primary endpoint, RBC-transfusion independence for at least 
182 days, is clinically relevant. In this disease population that may survive for several years, the 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 81/123 
 
 
  
 
International MDS Working Group (IWG) defined 2-month duration of response. A longer duration was 
chosen because a sustained 6-month response would be considered a more notable clinical outcome. 
All secondary endpoints are measured according to MDS IWG standardized response criteria for 
evaluating clinically significant responses in patients in low to intermediate 1 risk disease. 
One hundred and forty eight (148) patients were enrolled in the MDS-003 study. In MDS-004 study, 
205 patients were enrolled, randomised to receive lenalidomide 10 mg QD under the cyclic regimen, 5 
mg QD under the continuous regimen, or placebo during the double blind phase.  
A total of 145 patients proceeded to the OL phase of this study.  
Patients enrolled in the 2 primary studies (MDS-003 and MDS-004) had comparable baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics. In both studies, the median age of patients was 71 years in 
MDS-003 and 68 years in MDS-004, reflecting that MDS is a disease of the elderly. There was a female 
predominance in both studies (65.5% and 76.1%, respectively) consistent with the expected 
demographics for a del (5q) MDS population. Patients were predominantly white (96.6% and 98.5%, 
respectively). 
Other disease characteristics at baseline were comparable between the 2 studies and across dosing 
groups. Use of anti-anaemic agents prior to inclusion was comparable across dosing groups in MDS 
004. 
It should be noted that: 
- If the median duration of MDS at baseline is similar across the 3 arms of MDS 004 study (2 to 3 
years), the ranges are different. The maximal duration of MDS for patients of Pbo arm is 14 years 
compared to 17 years in 5 mg arm and 29 years in 10 mg arm. 
- FAB subtype was mainly RA or RARS (79% of MDS 003 population, 64% of MDS 004 population) 
meaning that patients were of relatively better prognosis compared to RAEB and RAEBt patients. 
- For 17.3% of MDS 003 patients and 29.8% of MDS 004 patients, IPSS score was int-2, high or 
missing. The part of eligibility violations is non negligible. This explains the use of MITT population for 
evaluation of efficacy endpoints;  
- An imbalance was observed within the MDS-004 study, with a slightly higher proportion of patients 
with 5q syndrome (usually associated with a good prognosis, a longer OS, and a lower risk of 
progression to AML) in the placebo group than in each of the lenalidomide groups. 
Overall, the demographic characteristics and baseline disease-related characteristics are consistent 
with published data on MDS del (5q) population 
MDS 003 is non comparative study and MDS 004 is a comparative dose refinement study. This clinical 
development is the reverse of a conventional scheme (dose finding study followed by a comparative 
confirmatory pivotal study).  
The use of placebo as comparator is appropriate since there is no active reference treatment, for low to 
intermediate 1 risk MDS patients, with an EU marketing authorisation. 
As proposed by the Applicant, the lenalidomide recommended dose is 10 mg once daily on days 1-21 
of repeated 28-day cycles. MDS 003 study was not designed to prospectively compare the 10 mg 
continuous and 10 mg syncopated regimens, but both regimens showed impressive activity. MDS 004 
objective was to refine the lenalidomide dosing schedule comparing the 10 mg 21/28d to 5 mg 28/28d 
and to placebo 28/28d. None of the studies was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 10 mg 
lenalidomide administered on a continuous 28-days regimen vs. a 21-day cyclic regimen.

Firstly, the 10-mg dose using the 21-of-28 day cycle was chosen for MDS-004 because grade 4 
neutropenia was reported less frequently with this regimen in MDS-003 study, while the RBC-
transfusion independence rate was still comparable to that for the 28-of-28 day cycle regimen, 
duration of RBC-TI was longer even though the response is a little bit delayed compared to 10 mg 
28/28d. The median dose/treatment day/cycle observed in the 10-mg dosing groups in MDS-003 
(continuous regimen) and MDS-004 (cyclic regimen) suggest that the initial daily dose of 10 mg QD 
can be maintained for slightly longer under a cyclic regimen compared to a continuous dosing regimen. 
The 7-day break in treatment may confer better tolerability during the first 3 to 4 cycles of treatment. 
Secondly, the MDS 004 statistical analysis plan owed both comparisons [10 mg 21/28d versus placebo 
28/28d] and [5 mg 28/28d versus placebo 28/28d], on response rate for ≥182 days. Both p-values 
were statistically significant in favour of lenalidomide arm. Even though the study was not powered to 
compare 5 mg with 10 mg dose, a subgroup analysis showed that 10 mg lenalidomide was consistently 
associated with a higher transfusion independent response rate by 182 days of treatment compared 
with 5 mg regardless of baseline characteristics.  
In MDS 004 study, the proportion of patients who completed the DB phase of the study was higher in 
the 10-mg group (56.5%), followed by the 5-mg group (33.3%), and then placebo (4.5%). Following 
the DB phase, patients entering the OL phase, were allowed to cross over from Pbo to 5-mg 
lenalidomide (called Pbo/5mg), from 5mg to 5mg, from 5mg to 10 mg, from 10 mg to 5 mg, from 10 
mg to 10 mg. The proportion of lenalidomide-treated patients who completed the OL phase of the 
study ranged from 23.2% (in the Pbo/5mg group) to 43.8% (in the 10mg/10mg group). 
Moreover, the Applicant claimed that 10-mg cyclic and 5-mg continuous regimens have similar 
tolerability.  
But adverse events (AE) that lead to a dose reduction or interruption were more frequent (73.9%) in 
the 10-mg cyclic regimen than in the 5-mg continuous regimen (63.8%). The primary reason for 
discontinuation was lack of therapeutic effect in 52 patients (35.1%) in MDS 003 and in 113 patients 
(55.1%) in MDS 004 of which 50.2% for lack of erythroid response. On the other hand, AE that led to 
discontinuation of the study drug occurred more frequently in the 5-mg continuous regimen (17.4% 
vs. 8.7%) and the 2-year AML rate of progression to AML is numerically higher in 5mg arm compared 
to Pbo. 
At the end, the lenalidomide dose 10 mg was preferred to 5 mg and the scheme of administration 
21/28d preferred to 28/28d.  
Treatment is to be continued until unacceptable AEs or progression/relapse. MDS 003 mentioned a 
maximal duration of treatment total of 24 cycles and MDS 004 a total of 156 weeks. The stopping rule 
has been defined, in a further step, as follows: Patients without at least a minor erythroid response 
within 4 months of therapy initiation demonstrated by at least a 50% reduction in transfusion 
requirements or, if not transfused, a 1g/dl rise in haemoglobin, should discontinue lenalidomide 
treatment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
MDS 003 being a non comparative study may give essentially descriptive information on RBC-TI, OS 
and progression to AML. 
Lenalidomide-induced RBC-transfusion independence was associated with a median increase from 
baseline in blood Hb concentration of 5.9 g/dL in the responders in the MITT population. Both 
syncopated and continuous regimens were associated with a median increase from baseline in blood 
Hb concentration. 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 83/123 
 
 
  
 
Response to lenalidomide was rapid (median time to response in MITT population, 4.1 weeks) and 
sustained. The median duration of transfusion independence was 97.0 weeks in the MITT population 
and 114.4 weeks in the ITT population. 
Lenalidomide therapy resulted in at least a 50% decrease from pre-treatment in RBC transfusion 
requirements in 74.5% (70/94) of the patients in the MITT population. The transfusion-reduction 
response rate was 74.6% (47/63) in the 10 mg continuous regimen and 74.2% (23/31) in the 10 mg 
syncopated regimen. 
Major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 40.9% and 30.7% of patients, respectively.  
The incidence of progression to acute myeloid leukemia has been explored in 147 of the 148 patients. 
The median duration of follow-up for all MDS-003 patients was 38.4 months (range:  0.3 to 
81.9 months). Considering that data for progression to AML/survival were available for 147 patients in 
the ITT population, the overall 5-year cumulative incidence of progression to AML in the ITT population 
was 28.6%.  
MDS 004 is designed as a comparative trial. It showed that lenalidomide is effective in 
achieving transfusion independence for ≥ 182 days in transfusion dependent patients with lower risk 
MDS (IPSS low or INT-1) associated with del(5q) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. 
In the MITT population, the RBC-TI has been achieved in 56.1% (95% CI: 39.7-71.5) in the 10 mg 
cyclic group and 42.6% (95% CI: 28.3-57.8) in the 5 mg continuous group, both significantly better 
than placebo; in the ITT populations, the corresponding figures were 55.1% and 34.8%, respectively. 
The transfusion independence attained was seen across all of the subgroups analyzed including 
baseline cytogenetics (isolated del (5q) vs. 1 or more cytogenetic abnormalities), FAB classification, 
IPSS and WPSS risk groups. However, the demonstration of a clinical benefit is based on a unique trial 
which is, as a matter of fact, not comparative.  
The median durations of RBC TI for the 10 mg and 5 mg groups in MDS-004 were not reached at 
database lock (14 Jun 2010), but the lower bounds of the CIs are 98 weeks and 46 weeks in favour of 
the 10 mg dose level. 
The onset of transfusion independence in response to lenalidomide treatment is based on a limited size 
of patients (20 patients treated with 5 mg lenalidomide, 23 with 10 mg). The initial appearance of a TI 
response may take some months (100% of responses becoming evident within 6 months of treatment 
initiation). 
From a methodological point of view, the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (RBC-TI) is sullied 
by the cross over in MDS 004 study: 56 out of the 67 patients randomised to Pbo arm discontinued the 
DB phase of the study at week 16 due to lack of efficacy, were unblinded and switched to the 5 mg 
lenalidomide arm. The primary efficacy endpoint (transfusion independency) supports one single 
component of the benefit on a relatively short term. The MDS PASS requested aims to confirm long 
term benefit such as overall survival. Moreover, the switch from placebo to lenalidomide 5 mg occurred 
early during the DB phase. It was planned to happen after the week 16 response assessment. 
Nevertheless, in the DB treatment phase, the median duration of treatment with placebo was 16.0 
weeks (range, 1.3 – 54.4 weeks); this means that half of patients in Pbo arm discontinued at or before 
the protocol-defined time. 
Subgroups analyses of TI responses are of minor relevance as the size of each stratum is limited. 
Approximately 50% MDS-004 patients had received a prior treatment with ESA as well-established use 
in the treatment of anaemia due to MDS. This questions the place of lenalidomide in the 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 84/123 
 
 
 
  
 
armamentarium of MDS del 5q. The indication claimed for Revlimid cannot be as “first line” treatment 
(prior or instead of ESA). 
Additional endpoints of the study included: 
Cytogenetic response  
In the 10 mg arm major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 30.0% and 24.0% of 
patients, respectively. The achievement of transfusion independence is not dependent upon complete 
elimination of the malignant clone since a proportion of patients achieved transfusion independence in 
the absence of a cytogenetic response. 
Assessment of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)  
Improvement of Quality of Life was seen with more robust results with the 10 mg dose compared to 
the 5 mg dose. 
Overall survival  
When assessed by the ITT analysis, and over the whole study (DB plus OL phases), there was no 
difference in overall survival across the treatment groups (p=0.2456), although 56 patients in the 
placebo group crossed over to receive 5 mg of lenalidomide after Week 16. However when analysing 
the Kaplan Meier curve per treatment arm, it appears graphically that the 10 mg curve falls earlier 
than the 5 mg or the Pbo curves. Patients died as a majority from disease progression (MDS or AML 
progression).  
A Cox proportional hazards model has showed that achieving RBC TI with duration of ≥ 182 days was 
associated with a significant reduction (51%) in the relative risk of death. However, the crossover 
design of Study MDS-004 precludes a definitive answer regarding long-term effects of lenalidomide 
treatment. Based on a multivariate analysis assessing the influence of prognostic factors on overall 
survival, patients who achieved transfusion independence had a better OS than non responding 
patients.  Similarly, achieving a cytogenetic response to lenalidomide was associated with prolonged 
overall survival compared with non-response. All these statements are controversial since they do not 
take into account the cross over from Pbo to lenalidomide. 
Progression to acute myeloid leukaemia  
As of data cut-off 26 Nov 2012, the 2-year rate for progression to AML was 12.3% in the 10-mg 
lenalidomide group, 21.2% in the 5-mg lenalidomide group, and 16.3% in the placebo group. The 
respective 5-year rates were 28.9%, 45.0%, and 50.7%. Based on a multivariate analysis assessing 
the influence of prognostic factors on progression to AML, patients who achieved the primary end point 
of 26 weeks transfusion independence response had a lower cumulative incidence of progression to 
AML than those who did not respond with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 10.1% compared to 23.5%. 
The applicant states that there was no significant difference in the risk of progression to AML over time 
between the 3 randomised treatment arms in the MDS-004 study but overall median time to AML has 
not yet been reached for the lenalidomide treatment groups, the population size in each arm of the 
trial is small, the duration of placebo treatment is short and the majority of patients from placebo arm 
switched to lenalidomide arm. 
The TP53 mutation being present in 20 to 25% of lower-risk MDS Del 5q patients seems associated 
with a higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical 
trial of Revlimid in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS-004), the 2-year rate 
of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with a TP53 mutation and 3.6% in patients with no TP53 
mutation (p=0.0038). 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 85/123 
 
 
  
 
Imbalances in certain baseline disease characteristics such % bone marrow blasts, transfusion burden, 
cytogenetic complexity, karyotype abnormalities, prognostic score, could influence progression to AML. 
The sample size of each of the baseline prognostic factors subgroups is small and limits a formal 
analysis of the influence of any individual factor on progression to AML. Moreover, considering that the 
majority of MDS 004 patients of the Pbo arm (56/67) switched to lenalidomide arms, the appreciation 
of the risk of AML transformation is biased. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of lenalidomide was evaluated in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- 
or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality, with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, in two main studies: a Phase III, 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study of two doses of oral 
lenalidomide (10 mg and 5 mg) versus placebo (MDS-004); and a Phase II, a multicentre, single-arm, 
open-label study of lenalidomide (10 mg) (MDS-003).  
In study MDS-004, in which 205 patients were equally randomised to receive lenalidomide 10 mg, 5 
mg or placebo, the primary efficacy analysis consisted of a comparison of the transfusion-
independence response rates of the 10 mg and 5 mg lenalidomide arms versus the placebo arm 
(double-blind phase 16 to 52 weeks and open-label up to a total of 156 weeks). Patients who did not 
have evidence of at least a minor erythroid response after 16 weeks were to be discontinued from 
treatment. Patients who had evidence of at least a minor erythroid response could continue therapy 
until erythroid relapse, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients, who initially received 
placebo or 5 mg and did not achieve at least a minor erythroid response after 16 weeks of treatment 
were permitted to switch from placebo to 5 mg lenalidomide or continue lenalidomide treatment at 
higher dose (5 mg to 10 mg). 
In MDS-003, in which 148 patients received lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg, the primary efficacy 
analysis consisted of an evaluation of the efficacy of lenalidomide treatments to achieve 
haematopoietic improvement in patients with low- or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes.  
In MDS-004, a significant larger proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes achieved the 
primary endpoint of transfusion independence (>182 days) on lenalidomide 10 mg compared with 
placebo (55.1% vs. 6.0%).  Amongst the 47 patients with an isolated Del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality 
and treated with lenalidomide 10 mg, 27 patients (57.4%) achieved red blood cell transfusion 
independence. 
The median time to transfusion independence in the lenalidomide 10 mg arm was 4.6 weeks. The 
median duration of transfusion independence was not reached in any of the treatment arms, but 
should exceed 2 years for the lenalidomide-treated patients. The median increase in haemoglobin 
(Hgb) from baseline in the 10 mg arm was 6.4 g/dL.  
Additional endpoints of the study included cytogenetic response (in the 10 mg arm major and minor 
cytogenetic responses were observed in 30.0% and 24.0% of patients, respectively), assessment of 
Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Results of the 
cytogenetic response and HRQoL were consistent with the findings of the primary endpoint and in 
favour of lenalidomide treatment compared to placebo. 
In MDS-003, a large proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes achieved transfusion 
independence (>182 days) on lenalidomide 10 mg (58.1%). The median time to transfusion 
independence was 4.1 weeks. The median duration of transfusion independence was 114.4 weeks. The 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 86/123 
 
 
  
 
median increase in haemoglobin (Hgb) was 5.6 g/dL. Major and minor cytogenetic responses were 
observed in 40.9% and 30.7% of patients, respectively. 
All results of the additional endpoints were consistent with the findings of the primary endpoint and in 
favour of lenalidomide treatment compared to placebo but the risk for progression to AML remained a 
safety concern. 
All the investigations performed to better characterise the prognostic factors of progression to AML 
(such baseline endogenous EPO level or prior ESA treatment) suffer methodological limits. 
The activity of lenalidomide in correcting anaemia can be established in the indication “low or int 1 –
risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without other cytogenetic 
abnormalities” but the extent of the clinical benefit is mitigated by the uncertainties regarding OS, 
transformation to AML and occurrence of SPMs and a precise estimation of the benefit risk ratio is not 
feasible. 
Considering that (1) the risk for progression to AML has not been characterised in the target population 
for which an extension of the marketing authorisation was initially applied for, (2) the benefit of 
lenalidomide treatment is evidenced (achieving RBC-TI, cytogenetic response, durable response), the 
CHMP agreed to restrict lenalidomide treatment to those patients with the lowest risk among 
transfusion dependent del 5q MDS patients, i.e.; low or int-1 MDS associated with an isolated deletion 
5q.  The efficacy in the restricted indication is considered demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
In the 6 completed company-sponsored MDS clinical studies considered in the overall analysis of 
safety, a total of 652 patients received at least one dose of lenalidomide (25 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, or 5 
mg QD), including 56 placebo-treated patients who received lenalidomide in the open-label phase of 
MDS-004.  
In further support of the safety of lenalidomide in MDS, additional safety information is available from 
postmarketing surveillance activities, non-MAH sponsored clinical studies (e.g., investigator-initiated 
trials [IITs]), compassionate use/named patient use, or the published literature.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 205 patients were enrolled in study MDS-004, with 67 in the placebo arm, 69 in the 5-mg 
lenalidomide arm, and 69 in the 10-mg lenalidomide arm.  All 205 (100%) patients were in the ITT 
population and the Safety population, and 139 (67.8%) were in the MITT population.   
The median daily dose of lenalidomide received per cycle (for the first 6 cycles) ranged from 5.0 mg to 
2.5 mg in the 5-mg group and from 10.0 mg to 5.0 mg in 10-mg group, and was consistently higher in 
the 10-mg group. The respective median daily doses remained stable through month/cycle 12 
Overall, the percentages of patients who had at least one dose reduction or interruption due to an AE 
were similar between the lenalidomide groups (59.4 % and 62.3% for the 5-mg and 10-mg groups, 
respectively) and higher than that of the placebo group (3.0%). 
The median time to first dose reduction or interruption due to an AE was 43.0 days for the 5-mg group 
and 27.0 day for the 10-mg group; and occurred earlier compared with the placebo group (79.0 days). 
The median duration of the first dose interruption was 7.0 days in the placebo group, and increased 
with increasing dose of lenalidomide (11.0 days and 14.0 days in the 5-mg and 10-mg groups, 
respectively). 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 87/123 
 
 
  
 
A  total  of  141  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  open-label  lenalidomide  and  were  included  in  the 
open-label  treated  set  of  study  MDS-004.  Of  those,  111  patients  received  5-mg,  including  placebo 
patients who crossed over to 5 mg and patients randomised to 10 mg who subsequently had their dose 
reduced  (Pbo/5mg,  5mg/5mg,  and  10mg/5mg);  and  30  patients  received  10-mg  (5mg/10mg  and 
10mg/10mg). 
The shortest median duration of treatment was in the 5mg/10mg group (15.7 weeks; range 2.3-136.0 
weeks),  the  group  that  crossed  over  to  a  higher  dose  at  OL.  This  short  duration  may  reflect  patients 
who  did  not  achieve  transfusion  independence  or  at  least  a  minor  erythroid  response,  and 
subsequently stopped at 16 weeks of the DB phase.  
The median duration of treatment for the Pbo/5mg group (68.9 weeks; range 0.4 - 140.6 weeks) was 
similar to that for the 5mg/5mg group (63.0 weeks; range 3.1 - 104.9 weeks). The median duration of 
treatment  was  somewhat  shorter  for  the  10mg/10mg  group  (52.4  weeks;  range  7.3  weeks–  106.9 
weeks).  
Overall, approximately half of the patients in each group remained on OL treatment for a minimum of 
an  additional  52  weeks  with  the  exception  of  the  5mg/10mg  group  (where  only  50%  remained  on 
treatment for at least 16 weeks).

Drug-related Adverse Events 
In study MDS-004, the drug-related AEs with the greatest differences between placebo and 
lenalidomide groups were:  neutropenia (14.9% in the placebo group and 75.4% in both lenalidomide 
groups); thrombocytopenia (3.0% in the placebo group, 39.1% in the 5-mg group, and 47.8% in the 
10-mg group); and pruritus (no patients in the placebo group, 17.4% in the 5-mg group, and 26.1% in 
the 10-mg group).

Death 
Overall, there were 101 (49.3%) deaths during the study period, 10 of which occurred within 30 days 
of the last dose of study drug. The percentages of deaths, including those that occurred within 30 days 
of their last dose, were comparable between the placebo group and the lenalidomide groups.  
The  majority  of  deaths,  across  all  three  treatment  groups,  were  due  to  disease  progression,  and  the 
numbers were comparable between the placebo group and the lenalidomide groups.

A  total  of  22  (10.7%)  of  the  205  patients  in  Study  MDS-004  died  during  the  first  52  weeks  of  the 
study.  Six  patients  died  while  on  treatment  or  within  30  days  of  last  dose  of  study  treatment  in  the 
double-blind  (DB)  and  open-label  (OL)  phases,  and  16  deaths  occurred  during  the  follow-up  survival 
phase (> 30 days after the last dose of lenalidomide). 
The figure above summarizes deaths by their occurrence on treatment (while receiving drug during DB 
or OL phase or within 30 days of discontinuing drug) and off treatment (during follow-up >30 days of 
discontinuing drug).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Second Primary Malignancies  
Late  in  2010,  an  increased  occurrence  of  Second  Primary  Malignancies  (SPMs)  was  noted  among 
lenalidomide-treated  patients  in  placebo-controlled  studies  in  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma 
(NDMM),  where 
lenalidomide  was  used 
together  with  melphalan  or  shortly 
following 
melphalan/autologous  stem  cell  transplant  therapy.  Ongoing  studies,  including  MDS-004  (where 
patients continue in follow-up), were amended to provide for long-term follow-up for the occurrence of 
SPMs. 
The following analyses were conducted to analyze SPMs in the MDS del (5q) setting and are included in 
this application: 
  The  frequency  of  SPMs  in  all  completed  studies  conducted  in  patients  with  MDS.  The  data  cut-off 
dates  for  the  MDS-001,  MDS-002,  MDS-003,  MDS-003E/MDS-009,  MDS-007,  and  PK-002  studies 
in this analysis were the respective database lock dates; the data cut-off date for MDS-004 was 22 
Aug 2011. 
  All  AEs  of  SPMs  by  PT  in  all  completed  studies  conducted  in  patients  with  MDS.  The  data  cut-off 
dates  for  the  MDS-001,  MDS-002,  MDS-003,  MDS-003E/MDS-009,  MDS-007,  and  PK-002  studies 
in this analysis were the respective database lock dates; the data cut-off date for MDS-004 was 22 
Aug 2011. 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 96/123 
 
 
 
  
 
  Summary of lenalidomide dosing, treatment duration and time to onset of SPMs in MDS, including 
postmarketing  data.  The data  cut-off  date  for  this analysis  was  22  Feb  2011  for  the  MDS  studies 
and 05 Sep 2011 for the postmarketing data; the PK-002 study was not included in this analysis. 
  Summary of risk factors for developing SPMs in patients with MDS, including postmarketing data. 
The data cut-off date for this analysis was 22Feb2011 for the MDS studies and 05 Sep 2011 for the 
postmarketing data; the PK-002 study was not included in this analysis. 
  A by-patient summary of SPMs, treatment, and outcome. The data cut-off dates for the MDS-001, 
MDS-002, MDS-003, MDS-003E/MDS-009, MDS-007, and PK-002 studies in this analysis were the 
respective database lock dates; the data cut-off date for MDS-004 was 22 Aug 2011. 
In the 6 completed MDS studies (MDS-001, MDS-002, MDS-003, MDS-004, MDS-007, and PK-002), a 
total  of  652  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  lenalidomide,  including  56  patients  who  received 
placebo during the DB phase of MDS-004 and then crossed over to receive lenalidomide during the OL 
phase.    The  PK-002  study  has  been  added  since,  with  a  data  cut-off  data  of  22  Feb  2011.  The  39 
patients  treated  with  lenalidomide  in  PK-002  have  been  included  in  the  overall  analyses  of  the 
frequency  of  SPMs,  AEs  reported  as  SPMs,  and  the  by-patient  summary  of  SPMs,  treatment,  and 
outcome, but not included in the analyses of time to onset of SPMs and risk factors for SPMs . A total 
of 557 lenalidomide-treated patients were included in the latter 2 analyses with a data cut-off date of 
22  Feb2011,  as  well  as  patients  exposed  to  lenalidomide  in  the  postmarketing  setting  (N=33,917), 
with a data cut-off date of 05Sep2011. 
In  the  MDS-004  study,  patients  randomised  to  placebo  could  receive  lenalidomide  after  16  weeks  if 
there  was  no  evidence  of  at  least  a  minor  erythroid  response.  As  a  result,  56  of  the  67  patients 
randomised to placebo subsequently received lenalidomide treatment after Week 16.  Given the limited 
number  of  patients  randomised  to  placebo  who  did  not  receive  lenalidomide  (11  patients)  and  the 
short  duration  of  placebo  treatment  during  the  DB  phase  (median  of  16  weeks),  only  patients 
randomised to lenalidomide treatment (596 patients) are included in the analyses of frequency of SPMs  
and AEs reported as SPMs .

Overall, in the 6 completed MDS studies (MDS-001, MDS-002, MDS-003, MDS-004, MDS-007, and PK-
002),  29  of  596  (4.9%)  lenalidomide-treated  patients  experienced  a  new  cancer  including  17  (2.9%) 
patients with invasive SPMs and 13 (2.2%) patients with non-melanoma skin cancers .  The incidence 
of SPMs was generally higher in MDS-003 (continuous regimen) compared to other MDS studies, which 
may  be  attributable  to  the  longer  mean  duration  of  drug  exposure  and  duration  of  follow-up  in  this 
study.  
The MAH has submitted the following information about SPMs that occurred after the data cut-off date 
for the MDS-004 study. Two patients in the MDS-004 study had SPMs (invasive SPMs, solid tumours) 
that  were  reported  to  the  MAH  after  the  data  cut-off  date  of  22  Aug  2011.  One  Patient    had  breast 
cancer  (reported  to  the  MAH  in  Oct  2011),  and  one  Patient    had  oropharyngeal  cancer  stage 
unspecified  (reported  to  the  MAH  in  Sep  2011).  Narratives  for  the  29  patients  who  had  at  least  one 
SPM in the completed MDS clinical studies, as well as 2 patients in the MDS-004 study who had SPMs

reported  to  the  MAH  after  the  22  Aug  2011  data  cut-off  date  (up  to  31  Dec  2011),  have  been 
submitted. 
Since  the  last  report  submitted  in  the  original  dossier  (17  Feb  2012),  2  additional  SPMs  (one  in  the 
PBO/5  mg  group  [endometrial  cancer]  and  one  in  the  5  mg  group  [hepatocellular  carcinoma])  were 
reported  as  causes  of  death  during  survival  follow-up  phase  as  causes  of  death,  bringing  the  total 
number of patients with SPMs in Study MDS-004 to 10 of the 194 lenalidomide-treated patients. Eight 
patients  had  invasive  solid  tumors  and  2  patients  had  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  (2  patients 
developed 2 invasive SPMs each bringing the total number of SPMs to 12 in these 10 patients). 
Updated SPM analysis (data cut-off 26 November 2012) 
Pooled  data  from  Studies  MDS-003  and  MDS-004  show  that  the  incidence  rates  of  invasive  SPMs 
among  lenalidomide-treated  patients  were  comparable  for  patients  treated  for  <  2  years  (2.37/100 
person-years)  versus  ≥2  years  (1.03/100  person-years).  Similarly,  the  incidence  rates  of  invasive 
SPMs  were  comparable  for  patients  treated  for  <  1  year  (2.96/100  person-years)  versus  ≥  1  year 
(1.14/100 person-years). 
The  overall  incidence  rate  of  invasive  SPMs  in  lenalidomide-treated  patients  in  Studies  MDS-003  and 
MDS-004  was  within  the  expected  rate  for  the  general  elderly  population  (1.68/100  person-years 
versus approximately 2.1/100 person-years), suggesting that treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS)  with  single-agent  lenalidomide  does  not  have  an  apparent  impact  on  the  risk  of  developing 
invasive SPMs. 
Progression  to  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  in  patients  with  MDS  represents  a  progression  of  the 
disease, and thus AML is not considered a second primary malignancy (SPM). However the impact of a 
prolonged treatment with lenalidomide on the risk of progression to AML is unknown. 
Discontinuation/Dose reductions due to adverse events 
Overall, the percentages of patients who had at least one dose reduction or interruption due to an AE 
were  similar  between  the  lenalidomide  groups  (59.4  %  and  62.3%  for  the  5-mg  and  10-mg  groups, 
respectively) and higher than that of the placebo group (3.0%). 
The median time to first dose reduction or interruption due to an AE was 43.0 days for the 5-mg group 
and 27.0 day for the 10-mg group; and occurred earlier compared with the placebo group (79.0 days).   
The  median  duration  of  the  first  dose  interruption  was  7.0  days  in  the  placebo  group,  and  increased 
with  increasing  dose  of  lenalidomide  (11.0  days  and  14.0  days  in  the  5-mg  and  10-mg  groups, 
respectively). 
Approximately 40% of patients in the 10-mg group received treatment for at least 52 weeks (median 
50.3 weeks), compared with approximately 20% of patients in the 5-mg group (median 18.0 weeks).  
At least one AE leading to dose reduction was reported in 59.4% in the 5-mg group and 60.9% in the 
10-mg group.  
•  Neutropenia (31.9% in the 5-mg group and 37.7% in the 10-mg group);  
• 
• 
Thrombocytopenia (14.5% in the 5-mg group and 24.6% in the 10-mg group);  
Febrile neutropenia (2.9% in the 5-mg group and no patients in the 10-mg group)

•  Rash NOS (2.9% in the 5-mg group and no patients in the 10-mg group) 
•  Diarrhoea NOS (2.9% in the 5-mg group and 4.3% in the 10-mg group) 
The relatively high percentages of patients in both groups with dose reductions due to neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia  are  consistent  with  the  protocol-defined  dose  reduction  plan  for  management  of 
cytopenias. 
Analysis  of  the  long-term  safety  data  in  patients  receiving  lenalidomide  was  generally  similar  to  that 
observed during the first 16 weeks, suggesting that there was no delayed or cumulative toxicity. 
The dose-reduction guidance proposed for patients who receive lenalidomide and develop neutropenia 
or thrombocytopenia are those specified for Study MDS-004 (Table 51).

Post marketing experience 
In  order  to  explore  the  possible  impact  of  lenalidomide  on  the  time  to  progression  to  acute  myeloid 
leukaemia  (AML)  in  MDS  del  (5q)  patients,  Celgene  implemented  a  specific  data  collection 
questionnaire  to  collect  important  data  elements  for  these  reports,  including:  date  of  initial  MDS 
diagnosis; specific MDS sub-type and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) category; date of 
lenalidomide  initiation;  date  of  progression  to  AML;  and  possible  confounding  factors,  including 
previous chemotherapy, baseline bone marrow and laboratory results.  
Of the 425 reports of progression to AML, 249 had sufficient data available to calculate the time from 
initiation  of  lenalidomide  therapy  to  the  diagnosis  of  progression  to  AML.  Classification  by  the  IPSS 
status and MDS subtype was not available for these events.  
The  median  time  to  progression  among  patients  in  these  249  reports  was  85  days,  the  mean  was 
179.9  days,  and  the  range  was  from  2  to  1,460  days.    Over  half  of  the  events  (54.6%;  136/249) 
occurred during the first 90 days of therapy, as shown in Figure 20: 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 101/123 
 
 
 
  
 
Figure  22.  Time  from  Initiation  of  Lenalidomide  Therapy  to  Progression  to  Acute  Myeloid 
Leukaemia 
The  overall  reporting  rate  of  progression  to  AML  is  1.3%  (425/33,917).  Progression  to  AML  is 
considered part of the natural history of MDS and therefore a relatively small number of reports were 
received. 
Ongoing and future studies 
Study MDS-005 
Study  CC-5013-MDS-005  is  an  ongoing  phase  3,  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-
controlled trial that compares the efficacy and safety of oral lenalidomide therapy to that of placebo in 
patients  with  transfusion-dependent  (TD)  anaemia  due  to  International  Prognostic  Scoring  System 
(IPSS)  low-  or  intermediate-1  (INT  1)-risk  myelodysplastic  syndromes  (MDS)  without  deletion  (del) 
5q[31] who are unresponsive or refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of Revlimid in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is based on data from 
a total of 286 patients from one Phase II study and one Phase III study. In the Phase II, all 148 
patients were on lenalidomide treatment. In the Phase III study, 69 patients were on lenalidomide 5 
mg, 69 patients on lenalidomide 10 mg and 67 patients were on placebo during the double-blind phase 
of the study.  
Most adverse events tended to occur during the first 16 weeks of therapy with lenalidomide. 
Serious  adverse  reactions  included  venous  thromboembolism  (deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary 
embolism), grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. 
The  most  frequently  observed  adverse  reactions  which  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  lenalidomide 
groups  compared  to  the  control  arm  in  the  Phase  III  study  were  neutropenia  (76.8%), 
thrombocytopenia  (46.4%),  diarrhoea  (34.8%),  constipation  (19.6%),  nausea  (19.6%),  pruritus 
(25.4%), rash (18.1%), fatigue (18.1%) and muscle spasms (16.7%). 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report

Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (bacterial,  viral  and  fungal  infections,  iron  overload,  hyperglycaemia, 
decreased appetite, altered mood, cardiac failure, haematoma, bronchitis, abdominal gain, toothache, 
dyspepsia,  dry  skin,  pruritus,  arthralgia,  myalgia,  back  pain,  pyrexia,  fall,  cough)  were    included  in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The  major  dose  limiting  toxicities  of  lenalidomide  include  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  A 
complete  blood  cell  count,  including  white  blood  cell  count  with  differential  count,  platelet  count, 
haemoglobin,  and  haematocrit  should  be  performed  at  baseline,  every  week  for  the  first  8 weeks  of 
lenalidomide  treatment  and  monthly  thereafter  to  monitor  for  cytopenias.  A  dose  reduction  may  be 
required.  In  case  of  neutropenia,  the  physician  should  consider  the  use  of  growth  factors  in  patient 
management.  Patients  should  be  advised  to  promptly  report  febrile  episodes.  Co-administration  of 
lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with caution. 
An  increased  risk  of  DVT  and  PE  is  associated  with  the  use  of  lenalidomide  with  dexamethasone  in 
patients  with  multiple  myeloma,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  patients  with  myelodysplastic  syndromes 
treated with lenalidomide monotherapy.   
The  potential  risk  of  hepatic  disorders  was  already  presented  in  section  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  existing 
SmPC.  The  CHMP  confirmed  that  other  important  potential  risks  (peripheral  neuropathy,  cardiac 
failure,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  renal  failure,  ischaemic  heart  disease  including  myocardial  infarction, 
interstitial lung disease) were already adequately reflected in the Product Information. 
In  clinical  trials  of  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma,  a  4-fold  increased  incidence  of  SPM  has  been 
observed  in  patients  receiving  Revlimid  (7.0%)  compared  with  controls  (1.8%).  The  potential  risk  of 
second  primary  malignancies  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  as  a  warning,  and  this 
adverse  drug  reaction  is  also  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  The  MAH  has  proposed  studies  to 
understand  and  characterise  this  risk  specifically  for  MDS  (MDS  PASS;  US  CONNECT  MDS/AML 
Registry) as part of the Risk Management Plan. 
During the double blind phase (52 weeks), 4/67 (6%) placebo patients had progression to AML versus 
7/138 (6.5%) lenalidomide patients. During the entire study, 48/194 patients (24.7%) exposed to 
lenalidomide have progressed to AML.  
The risk for progression to AML was not considered to be adequately characterised in the targeted 
population. Moreover, due to methodological limits, none of the updated results regarding progression 
to AML in Study MDS-005 or the additional sensitivity analyses from the MCR comparison to 
lenalidomide-treated patients in Studies MDS-003 and MDS-004 have given reassurance regarding the 
risk for an increased rate of progression to AML. 
Baseline variables including complex cytogenetics and TP53 mutation are associated with progression 
to AML in patients who are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality (see section 4.4). 
The  estimated  2-year  cumulative  risk  of  progression  to  AML  were  13.8%  in  patients  with  an  isolated 
Del  (5q)  abnormality  compared  to  17.3%  for  patients  with  Del  (5q)  and  one  additional  cytogenetic 
abnormality and 38.6% in patients with a complex karyotype.   
In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of Revlimid in myelodysplastic syndromes, the estimated 2-year 
rate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity and 3.6% in patients with 
IHC-p53 negativity (p=0.0038). In the patients with IHC-p53 positivity, a lower rate of progression to 
AML was observed amongst patients who achieved a transfusion independence (TI) response (11.1%) 
compared to a non-responder (34.8%).  
Considering that (1) the risk for progression to AML has not been characterised in the targeted 
population, (2) the benefit of lenalidomide treatment is evidenced (achieving RBC-TI, cytogenetic 
response, durable response), the safer option to manage safety concern would be to reserve 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report

lenalidomide treatment to patients with the lowest risk among transfusion dependent del 5q MDS 
patients, i.e.; low or int-1 MDS associated with an isolated deletion 5q.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
To manage the safety concern of a potential increased risk of AML, the CHMP considered it necessary 
to restrict the indication to “patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate-
1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality 
when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate”. In the restricted indication, the safety 
concern is mitigated. 
Conditional to the approval of this indication, the CHMP  considered the following measures  necessary 
to address issues related to safety: 
1.  A  post-authorisation  non-interventional,  safety  study  of  patients  with  myelodysplastic  syndromes 
(MDS) treated with lenalidomide to ascertain progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and survival 
among  patients  who  have  been  treated  with  at  least  one  complete  cycle  of  lenalidomide.  The 
secondary objectives of the study are: 
•  Characterization  of  the  safety  profile  of  lenalidomide  in  terms  of  hematological  and  non-
hematological  adverse  events,  including  infections,  bleeding,  thromboembolic  events,  major 
cardiac events and second primary malignancies (SPM) other than AML (which is considered as 
disease progression). 
•  Description of the characteristics of MDS patients treated with lenalidomide. 
• 
Evaluation  of  risk  factors  associated  with  progression  to  acute  myeloid  leukemia  and  overall 
survival among enrolled MDS patients treated with lenalidomide. 
•  Characterization  of  the  effectiveness  profile  of  lenalidomide  in  a  routine  care  setting, 
especially  erythroid  response,  transfusion  independence,  cytogenetic  response  and 
related long-term outcomes. 
•  Monitor the off-label use of lenalidomide in MDS patients 
This  study  should  be  part  of  the  pharmacovigilance  plan  as  Category  1  study.    Patients  receiving 
lenalidomide  for  treatment  of  MDS  should  be  included  in  the  PASS  study.  The  PASS  should 
collect: Patients  demographic  data,  baseline  characteristics  including  cytogenetics  (del  5q  status  and 
other  cytogenetic  abnormalities),  indication  and  response  to  ESA  treatment  if  administered,   safety 
outcomes including transformation to AML, occurrence of SPM and cause of death. 
The  PASS  and  enrolment  of  MDS  patients  receiving  lenalidomide  in  it,  should  be  considered  as  an 
imposed  obligation  and  therefore  be  included  as  a  condition  of  the  MA  (i.e.  category  1  of 
pharmacovigilance  activities  according  to  the  guideline  on  good  pharmacovigilance  practices  for  risk 
management  systems).  The  details  of  such  enrolment  should  be  agreed  with  NCAs  in  the  MS  where 
lenalidomide is expected to be used in the new indication. 
The final protocol is expected within 1 month after Commission Decision granting the new indication. 
2.  The  distribution  of  Direct  Healthcare  Professional  Communication  informing  prescribers  of  the 
granting  of  the  extension  of  indication  to  MDS  del  5q  and  warning  about  important  aspects  in  the 
clinical  use  of  Revlimid.  In  countries  where  Revlimid  is  already  launched,  the  MAH  should  provide  all 
potential  healthcare  professionals  with  updated  educational  material  (HCP  brochure  and  patient 
brochure including the PPP) together with the DHPC.

In  order  to  assist  patients  in  avoiding  foetal  exposure  to  lenalidomide,  the  Applicant  will  provide 
educational  material  to  health  care  professionals  to  reinforce  the  warnings  about  the  expected 
teratogenicity  of  lenalidomide,  to  provide  advice  on  contraception  before  therapy  is  started,  and  to 
provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing.  
The  prescriber  must  inform  the  patient  about  the  expected  teratogenic  risk  and  the  strict  pregnancy 
prevention  measures  as  specified  in  the  Pregnancy  Prevention  Programme  and  provide  patients  with 
appropriate  patient  educational  brochure,  patient  card  and/or  equivalent  tool  in  accordance  to  the 
national implemented patient card system.  
A  national  controlled  distribution  (prescribing  and  dispensing  control)  of  collecting  detailed  data 
relating to the indication in order to monitor closely the off-label use within the national territory and 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report

the  patient  card  system  will  be  discussed  at  national  level  with  each  National  Competent  Authority. 
Pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of 
lenalidomide  to  women  of  childbearing  potential  should  occur  within  7  days  of  the  prescription  and 
following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. 
To gather safety data on the use of lenalidomide in MDS patients, a PASS including patients with MDS 
treated  with  lenalidomide  was  requested  as  a  condition  of  the  marketing  authorisation.  Patients  with 
MDS treated with lenalidomide should be included in the PASS. 
To  inform  healthcare  professionals  (prescribers  and  pharmacists)  and  some  relevant  patients’ 
organisations  on  the  risk  factors  associated  with  progression  to  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  and  the 
enrolment of patients into the non-interventional PASS, the DHCP letter will be distributed to each HCP 
expected  to  prescribe  Revlimid.  In  countries  were  Revlimid  is  already  launched,  the  educational 
material (HCP brochure and patient brochure including the PPP) should be distributed together with the 
DHPC.

4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
[…] 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or 
intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Revlimid treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies 
(see section 4.4, karyotype) 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Lenalidomide treatment must not be started if the Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC) < 0.5 x 109/l and/or 
platelet counts < 25 x 109/l. 
Recommended dose 
The recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 10 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-
day cycles. Dosing is continued or modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (see section 4.4). 
Recommended dose adjustments during treatment and restart of treatment 
Dose adjustments, as summarized below, are recommended to manage grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia, or other grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide.

For patients who experience other toxicities 
For other grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, stop treatment and restart at next 
lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ grade 2 depending on the physician’s discretion. 
Lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for grade 2 or 3 skin rash. 
Lenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, and should not be resumed 
following discontinuation from these reactions. 
Discontinuation of lenalidomide 
Patients without at least a minor erythroid response within 4 months of therapy initiation, demonstrated 
by at least a 50% reduction in transfusion requirements or, if not transfused, a 1g/dl rise in haemoglobin, 
should discontinue lenalidomide treatment. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Revlimid in children aged 0-17 years have not yet been established. No data 
are available.  
Elderly population 
The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide have not been studied. Lenalidomide has 
been used in clinical trials in multiple myeloma patients up to 86 years of age and in myelodysplastic 
syndromes patients up to 95 years of age (see section 5.1).

The percentage of multiple myeloma patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between 
the lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. No overall difference in safety 
or efficacy was observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater pre-disposition of 
older individuals cannot be ruled out.  
For myelodysplastic syndromes patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and 
efficacy was observed between patients aged over 65 and younger patients.   
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose 
selection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Lenalidomide is substantially excreted by the kidney, therefore care should be taken in dose selection 
and monitoring of renal function is advised. 
No dose adjustments are required for patients with mild renal impairment and multiple myeloma or 
myelodysplastic syndromes. The following dose adjustments are recommended at the start of therapy 
for patients with moderate or severe impaired renal function or end stage renal disease.

cardiovascular disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes have been added to the product information. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
•  Counselling 
[…] 
For male patients taking lenalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that lenalidomide is 
present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in human 
semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution, all 
male patients taking lenalidomide must meet the following conditions: 
•  Understand the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a 
woman of childbearing potential 
•  Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman 
or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, during treatment and for 1 
week after dose interruptions and/or cessation of treatment. 
•  Understand that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking Revlimid or shortly 
after he has stopped taking Revlimid, he should inform his treating physician immediately and that 
it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or experienced in 
teratology for evaluation and advice. 
•  Contraception 
[…] 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and to a lesser extent in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes 
taking lenalidomide monotherapy, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also 
section 4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to 
one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 
4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may 
be reduced during co-treatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5).

Lenalidomide is present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable 
in human semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a 
precaution, and taking into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal 
impairment, all male patients taking lenalidomide should use condoms throughout treatment duration, 
during dose interruption and for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of 
childbearing potential and not using effective contraception (even if the man has had a vasectomy). 
[…] 
Educational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions 
In  order  to  assist  patients  in  avoiding  foetal  exposure  to  lenalidomide,  the  Marketing  Authorisation 
Holder  will  provide  educational  material  to  health  care  professionals  to  reinforce  the  warnings  about 
the  expected  teratogenicity  of  lenalidomide,  to  provide  advice  on  contraception  before  therapy  is 
started,  and  to  provide  guidance  on  the  need  for  pregnancy  testing.  The  prescriber  must  inform  the 
patient about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified 
in  the  Pregnancy  Prevention  Programme  and  provide  patients  with  appropriate  patient  educational 
brochure,  patient  card  and/or  equivalent  tool in  accordance  to the  national implemented  patient  card 
system.  A  national  controlled  distribution  (prescribing  and  dispensing  control)  of  collecting  detailed 
data relating to the indication in order to monitor closely the off-label use within the national territory 
and  the  patient  card  system  have  been  implemented  in  collaboration  with  each  National  Competent 
Authority. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same 
day.  Dispensing  of  lenalidomide  to  women  of  childbearing  potential  should occur  within  7 days  of  the 
prescription and following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. 
Other special warnings and precautions for use 
[…] 
Venous and arterial thromboembolic events 
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated 
with  an  increased  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  (predominantly  deep  vein  thrombosis  and 
pulmonary  embolism)  and  arterial  thromboembolism  (predominantly  myocardial  infarction  and 
cerebrovascular event) – see sections 4.5 and 4.8. 
In  patients  with  myelodysplatic  syndromes,  treatment  with  lenalidomide  monotherapy  was  also 
associated  with  a  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  (predominantly  deep  vein  thrombosis  and 
pulmonary embolism), but to a lesser extent than in patients with multiple myeloma – see sections 4.5 
and 4.8. 
[…] 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
The  major  dose  limiting  toxicities  of  lenalidomide  include  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  A 
complete  blood  cell  count,  including  white  blood  cell  count  with  differential  count,  platelet  count, 
haemoglobin,  and  haematocrit  should  be  performed  at  baseline,  every  week  for  the  first  8 weeks  of 
lenalidomide  treatment  and  monthly  thereafter  to  monitor  for  cytopenias.  A  dose  reduction  may  be 
required  (see  section 4.2).  In  case  of  neutropenia,  the  physician  should  consider  the  use  of  growth 
factors  in  patient  management.  Patients  should  be  advised  to  promptly  report  febrile  episodes.  Co-
administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with caution.

Progression to acute myeloid leukaemia in low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS 
•  Karyotype 
Baseline variables including complex cytogenetics are associated with progression to AML in subjects 
who are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality. In a clinical trial of Revlimid in low- 
or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, subjects who had a complex cytogenetics had the 
highest estimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML (38.6%).  The estimated 2-year rate of 
progression to AML in patients with an isolated Del (5q) abnormality was 13.8%, compared to 17.3% 
for patients with Del (5q) and one additional cytogenetic abnormality. 
As a consequence, the benefit/risk ratio of Revlimid when MDS is associated with Del (5q) and complex 
cytogenetics is unknown.  
• 
TP53 status 
A TP53 mutation is present in 20 to 25% of lower-risk MDS Del 5q patients and is associated with a 
higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of 
Revlimid in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS-004), the estimated 2-year 
rate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity (1% cut-off level of strong 
nuclear staining, using immunohistochemical assessment of p53 protein as a surrogate for TP53 
mutation status) and 3.6% in patients with IHC-p53 negativity (p=0.0038) (see section 4.8)

2.9.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
The  CHMP  considered  that  a  Direct  Healthcare  Professional  Communication  (DHPC)  was  needed  to 
communicate  on  the  risks  associated  with  lenalidomide  and  the  relevant  post-authorisation  safety 
study. 
Healthcare professionals who may prescribe or dispense lenalidomide and relevant patients’ 
organisations will be informed of the following: 
- Revlimid (lenalidomide) has been approved for “the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent 
anaemia  due  to  low-  or  intermediate-1-risk  myelodysplastic  syndromes  associated  with  an  isolated 
deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate.”  
-  A  clinical  trial  showed  an  increased  risk  of  progression  to  AML  in  patients  who  are  transfusion 
dependant and had complex cytogenetics at baseline compared with patients who had an isolated Del 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report

(5q) abnormality. The estimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML was 13.8% in patients 
with an isolated Del (5q) abnormality compared to 17.3% for patients with Del (5q) and one additional 
cytogenetic  abnormality  and  38.6%  in  patients  with  a  complex  karyotype.  The  benefit/risk  ratio  of 
Revlimid when MDS is associated with Del (5q) and complex cytogenetics is unknown. Treatment with 
Revlimid  is  therefore  limited  to  patients  with  an  isolated  deletion  5q  cytogenetic  abnormality  without 
additional cytogenetic abnormalities who are considered to be at lower risk for progression to AML. 
-  In  agreement  with  the  relevant  National  Competent  Authorities,  patients  who  are  prescribed 
lenalidomide  for  the  treatment  of  myelodysplastic  syndromes  should  be  entered  into  a  non-
interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) by the prescribing physician. Enrolment into the 
PASS  is  to  be  completed  in  parallel  to  the  first  prescription  of  lenalidomide  in  myelodysplastic 
syndromes.  
The  final  version  of  this  DHPC  agreed  by  the  CHMP  is  provided  in  Attachment  10  together  with  the 
communication plan (Attachment 11).  
The  MAH  should  agree  the  translations  and  local  specificities  of  the  DHPC  with  national  competent 
authorities.  The  DHPC  should  be  sent  in  accordance  with  its  communication  plan,  no  later  than  the 
week  commencing  10  June  2013  with  the  revised  SmPC  with  the  changes  highlighted  to  healthcare 
professionals. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Apoptotic  and  pro-erythropoïetic  properties  of  lenalidomide  translate  into  clinical  activity  i.e., 
transfusion  independence  and  erythroid  response.  In  MDS  004  study,  the  overall  RBC-transfusion 
independence  response  rate  for  the  MITT  population  was  56.1%  (23  of  41  patients)  in  the  10  mg 
lenalidomide  group,  42.6%  (20  of  47  patients)  in  the  5  mg  lenalidomide  group,  and  5.9%  (3  of  51 
patients)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  response  rates  in  both  lenalidomide  groups  were  statistically 
superior  to  that  in  the  placebo  group  (p  <  0.001).  RBC-TI  responses  are  associated  with  sustained 
increases in Hb levels. 
The median duration of RBC-TI in Study  MDS-004 has  not been reached. In  the Len 10 mg arm, the 
lower limit of 95% CI being 98.3 weeks, the shortest duration that could be observed is near 2 years. 
In  the  Len  5  mg  arm,  the  lower  limit  of  95%  CI  is  lower  (46.3  wks).  These  updated  estimations 
confirm that responses are maintained for a prolonged period. 
Lenalidomide  at  5  mg-  and  10  mg  doses  was  effective  at  producing  cytogenetic  responses  with  54% 
and 30.2% of evaluable patients achieving a cytogenetic response (major or minor) in the 10 mg and 5 
mg  lenalidomide  treatment  groups,  respectively.  No  cytogenetic  responses  were  observed  in  the 
placebo  group.  The  achievement  of  RBC-TI  is  not  dependent  upon  complete  elimination  of  the 
malignant clone since a proportion of patients achieved transfusion independence in the absence of a 
cytogenetic response. 
The  achievement  of  RBC-TI  in  lenalidomide  treated  patients  was  associated  with  an  improvement  in 
quality of life. 
Revlimid II 56 
Assessment report  
Page 116/123 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Even though lenalidomide is to be administered for a long period, the oral form (per os) is of particular 
interest since transfusion is an invasive and incapacitating treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
With  regards to  the  clinical  development,  the  optimal  dose  (5  or 10  mg)  and  regimen  (continuous  or 
syncopated) had not been determined before the initiation of the comparative pivotal phase III study. 
Since  MDS  004  was  not  designed  to  compare  5  mg  21/28d  vs.  10  mg  28/28d,  the  optimal  dose  and 
regimen  could  still  be  further  refined.  However,  the  10  mg  dose  appeared  to  produce  better  results 
than 5 mg. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (transfusion  independency)  supports  one  single  component  of  the 
benefit on a relatively short term. The updated results for Study MDS-004 confirm the expected impact 
of  known  prognostic  factors  in  the  OS  analysis,  in  subjects  with  low-/INT1-risk  MDS  (age,  baseline 
transfusion  burden,  and  baseline  ferritin  concentration  adversely  affecting  OS).  The  Cox  proportional 
hazards  model  confirmed  that  achieving  RBC  TI  with  duration  of  ≥182  days  was  associated  with  a 
significant reduction in the relative risk of death. Eight additional months of follow up (from 31 March 
2012  to  26  November  2012)  inform  on  mid-term  effect  on  OS.  However,  during  the  conduct  of 
MDS 004 study 56 out of the 67 patients randomised to Pbo arm discontinued the double-blind phase 
of  the  study  at  week  16  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  were  unblinded  and  crossed-over  to  the  5  mg 
lenalidomide arm. The crossover design of Study MDS-004 precludes a true estimation regarding long-
term effects of lenalidomide treatment. From a methodological point of view, the statistical significance 
cannot be invoked. The extent of the clinical benefit of lenalidomide versus Pbo may be overestimated. 
As evidenced by the percentages of MDS 004 patients who received prior ESA (around 40-50%), ESA 
administration  is  a  well  known  off-label  treatment  of  anaemia  in  MDS  patients.  The  other  half  of 
patients,  who  did  not  receive  prior  ESA  and  were  right  away  treated  with  lenalidomide,  may  have 
benefited from a first line of ESA. Other conventional anaemia treatment measures (transfusions, iron 
etc) are also available for such patients. Hence, the MDS indication in the Revlimid product information 
should be restricted as follows: “for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due 
to  low-  or  intermediate-1-risk  myelodysplastic  syndromes  associated  with  an  isolated  deletion  5q 
cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate.” 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide groups compared 
to  the  control  arm  in  MDS  004  study  were  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  diarrhoea,  constipation, 
nausea, pruritus, rash, fatigue and muscle spasms.  
Serious  adverse  reactions  with  lenalidomide  treatment  in  MDS  include,  as  expected,  haematologic 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia but the frequencies 
of these SAEs are much higher than in the current indication (RRMM). 
Transformation to AML is likely to occur in the course of MDS pathology but, in MDS 004 study, the 2-
years cumulative incidence rate of AML in lenalidomide arms (21.2 in 5 mg arm, 12.3 in 10 mg arm) is 
much higher than the expected rates (approximately 9%).  
In previous applications for Revlimid, lenalidomide has been associated with the risk of occurrence of 
SPMs.  According  to  the  MAH,  overall,  17  patients  exhibited  invasive  SPMs  in  the  6  completed  MDS 
Revlimid II 56

studies  (9  in  MDS  003,  4  in  MDS  004),  mainly  solid  tumours.  One  B  cell  malignancy  is  of  particular 
concern. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  key  uncertainty  of  this  application,  in  the  therapeutic  indication  as  initially  proposed  by  the 
applicant,  is  the  assessment  of  risk  for  progression  to  AML  in  patients  with  MDS  and  treated  with 
lenalidomide.  The  relationship  between  response  and  LFS/OS,  or  alternative  ways  to  analyse  registry 
data were not addressed.  The methodology of the registry studies is still questioned.  
Risk for progression to AML is not elucidated, preventing from appreciating benefit risk of lenalidomide 
in MDS del 5q patients, particularly when combined with other cytogenetic abnnormalities. However, in 
patients  with  isolated  5q  deletion,  this  uncertainty  is  much  smaller  and  it  will  be  addressed  through 
study MDS 005 and the MDS PASS. 
Even  if  updated,  the  safety  results  of  MDS  005  study  related  to  transformation  to  AML  are  not  yet 
informative since this study has been conducted on non del 5q patients (different from the population 
targeted  for  the  submission,  i.e.;  del  5  q  MDS),  with  a  too  short  follow  up  and  limited  number  of 
events  constraining  detailed  analyses.  However  this  trial  is  the  only  one  comparing  lenalidomide  to 
placebo. So, if the comparability is maintained (i.e., no switch to lenalidomide), the upcoming results 
of MDS 005 study are likely to inform on a potential risk to transformation to AML in low-int 1 risk MDS 
patients.    
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Whereas  transfusion  is  a  palliative  treatment,  lenalidomide  induces  cytogenetic  remissions  leading  to 
the  repopulation  of  the  BM  with  effective  blood  cell  precursors  and  restoration  of  normal  RBC 
haematopoiesis. In such, lenalidomide covers an unmet medical need. 
Compared  to  the  risks  related  to  transfusion  (haemochromatosis  and  its  complications),  lenalidomide 
exhibits  a  potential  increased  risks  of  progression  to  AML  and  death  and  occurrence  of  invasive 
malignancies.  
Established measures exist for the treatment of anaemia, including transfusions and other supportive 
measures (iron, vitamins etc). From a clinical point of view, the indication claimed for Revlimid cannot 
be as “first line” treatment but should reflect other available treatment options prior to lenalidomide. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  lenalidomide  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  transfusion-dependent 
anaemia  due  to  low-  or  intermediate-1-risk  myelodysplastic  syndromes  associated  with  an  isolated 
deletion  5q  cytogenetic  abnormality  when  other  therapeutic  options  are  insufficient  or  inadequate  is 
considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The  activity  of  lenalidomide  in  correcting  anaemia  is  undisputable  in  transfusion  dependent  MDS 
patients  with  del  5q  but  the  extent  of  the  clinical  benefit  is  mitigated  by  the  uncertainties  regarding 
transformation to AML, occurrence of SPMs and OS.

The extensive cross over of patients from Pbo to lenalidomide arm drained the comparator arm of the 
“so  called”  comparative  MDS  004  study  and  turned  the  study  into  a  non-comparative  trial.  This 
prevents the evaluation of the impact of lenalidomide on long term outcomes (AML transformation, risk 
of occurrence of SPMs and OS). 
Currently, there are no data from randomised controlled clinical trials that can definitively address the 
question  of  the  effect  of  lenalidomide  treatment  on  progression  to  AML  or  overall  survival  compared 
with  standard  of  care  (RBC  transfusions).  The  safety  concern  of  a  potential  increased  risk  of  AML 
remains. 
Considering  that  the  benefit  of  lenalidomide  treatment  is  evidenced  (achieving  RBC-TI,  cytogenetic 
response,  durable  response),  the  safer  option  to  manage  safety  concern  would  be  to  reserve 
lenalidomide  treatment  to  patients  with  the  lowest  risk  among  transfusion  dependent  del  5q  MDS 
patients i.e.; low or int-1 MDS associated with an isolated deletion 5q.   
To reflect both risk of transformation to AML and prior therapies used, the CHMP proposed to restrict 
the  use  of  Revlimid  to  “the  treatment of  patients  with  transfusion-dependent anaemia  due  to  low- or 
intermediate-1-risk  myelodysplastic  syndromes  associated  with  an  isolated  deletion  5q  cytogenetic 
abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate”.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
A post-authorisation non-interventional, safety study of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
treated  with  lenalidomide  to  ascertain  the  progression  to  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  and  survival 
among patients with MDS who have been treated with at least one complete cycle of lenalidomide.  
The  synopsis  of  this  study  has  been  agreed  by  the  CHMP  and  the  final  protocol  is  expected  within 
1 month after Commission Decision granting the new indication. 
4.  Recommendations 
 The application for an extension of indication is approvable since other concerns have all been 
resolved.

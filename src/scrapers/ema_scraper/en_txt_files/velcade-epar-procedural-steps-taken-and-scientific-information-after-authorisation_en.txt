A Phase II, single arm activity, safety, and 
pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s 
Oncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of 
bortezomib to multi agent re-induction chemotherapy in 
paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid 
malignancies (pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
[ALL] with T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic 
lymphoma [LL]). An effective re-induction multi-agent 
chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. 
VELCADE was administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to 
avoid potential overlapping toxicities with 
coadministered drugs in Block 3.  
VELCADE 
Page 4/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of 
Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 18 months 
of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% and the 4-
month event free survival rate was 44%. In B-ALL 
patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis (n = 
33) the CR rate was 79% and the 4-month event free 
survival rate was 73%. The CR rate in first-relapsed T-
cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% and the 4-month 
event free survival rate was 67%. The reported efficacy 
data are considered inconclusive.  
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and 
evaluated for safety. No new safety concerns were 
observed when VELCADE was added to the standard 
paediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The 
following adverse reactions (Grade ≥ 3) were observed 
at a higher incidence in the VELCADE containing 
treatment regimen as compared with a historical control 
study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: 
peripheral sensory neuropathy; ileus; hypoxia. No 
information on possible sequelae or rates of peripheral 
neuropathy resolution was available in this study. Higher 
incidences were also noted for infections with Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenia, increased ALT, hypokalaemia and 
hyponatraemia. No recommendation on a posology can 
be made considering the currently available data.

II and PL 
The MAH submitted the results of Study MMY 2036 
(RETRIEVE), a Phase II, single arm, open label study 
designed to determine the efficacy and safety of 
retreatment with Velcade in 130 patients with multiple 
myeloma. Patients (≥ 18 years of age) who previously 
had at least partial response on a Velcade containing 
regimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 
months after prior therapy, Velcade was started at the 
last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or ≤ 1.0 
mg/m2 (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 
3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent 
or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance 
with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was 
administered in combination with Velcade to 83 patients 
in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving 
dexamethasone during the course of Velcade treatment. 
The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to 
retreatment as assessed by EMBT criteria. The overall 
best response rate (CR + PR), to retreatment in 130 
patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4). 
The most common all grade adverse events occurring in 
at least 25% of patients were thrombocytopenia (55%), 
neuropathy (40%), anaemia (37%), diarrhoea (35%), 
and constipation (28%). All grade peripheral neuropathy 
and grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 
40% and 8.5% of patients, respectively.

Leukoencephalopathy (PML). Very rare cases with 
unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus 
infection, resulting in PML and death, have been 
reported in patients treated with VELCADE. Patients 
diagnosed with PML had prior or concurrent 
immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were 
diagnosed within 12 months of their first dose of 
VELCADE. Patients should be monitored at regular 
intervals for any new or worsening neurological 
symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as 
part of the differential diagnosis of CNS problems. If a 
diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be 
referred to a specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic 
measures for PML should be initiated. In addition 
VELCADE should be discontinued if PML is diagnosed.

In this variation application, the MAH provided the 
results of a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of Velcade in 
patients with advanced malignancies and varying 
degrees of liver dysfunction. 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in this 
during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients 
primarily with solid tumors and varying degrees of 
hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 
0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2. When compared to patients with 
normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did 
not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC. However, 
the dose-normalized mean AUC values were increased 
by approximately 60% in patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment.

Patients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a 
dose adjustment and should be treated per the 
recommended dose. A lower starting dose is 
recommended in patients with moderate or severe

application, the applicant committed to present the 
safety and efficacy of VELCADE in patients with 
previously treated light-chain amyloidosis, the 
marketing authorisation holder of VELCADE applied to 
update section 4.4 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) to remove the warning on 
amyloidosis and to include the results of this study in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. The package leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of 
the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
results from the planned Phase I/II clinical trial aimed at 
ruling out the possibility that secondary to proteasome 
inhibition bortezomib treatment may increase the risk of 
amyloidosis and/or may have an adverse impact on its 
progression and organ manifestations (Specific 
obligation SOB 015). 
Study CAN-2007 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-
escalation study investigating single-agent therapy with 
VELCADE in subjects with previously treated AL 
amyloidosis who required further treatment. The 
primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study 
was to determine the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
VELCADE 
Page 18/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based on Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of single agent 
therapy with VELCADE in subjects with previously 
treated AL-amyloidosis who required further therapy 
and the primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the 
study was to determine the safety of VELCADE in this 
patient population.  
The secondary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the 
study was to determine the haematologic response rate 
(CR+PR) and duration of response at the MTD (or 
maximum allowed doses if MTD was not reached).  
The safety profile of VELCADE emerging from study 
CAN-2007 is consistent with the current overall 
knowledge of VELCADE safety. Comparison of CAN-2007 
safety findings with those of the larger APEX study in 
multiple myeloma patients shows remarkably similar 
patterns. No unexpected AE was recorded. It is highly 
relevant that VELCADE treatments do not appear to 
worsen organ damage and/or clinical outcome of the 
underlying AL-amyloidosis. As a consequence, the 
warning on section 4.4 of the SmPC has been removed. 
Furthermore, the results of this study have been 
included in section 5.1 of the SmPC to indicate that no 
new safety concerns were observed during the study, 
and in particular VELCADE did not exacerbate target 
organ damage (heart, kidney and liver). In an

the CHMP to conduct a cumulative review of reports of 
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome 
(RPLS), leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), and acute 
febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND).  
The cumulative review of currently available safety data 
from clinical trials, literature, and post-marketing 
adverse event reports shows that RPLS is an ADR 
associated with the use of Velcade. As a consequence, 
the product information was updated to include in 
section 4.4 of the SPC that: 
"There have been reports of RPLS in patients receiving 
VELCADE. RPLS is a rare, reversible, rapidly evolving 
neurological condition, which can present with seizure, 
hypertension, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, 
and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain 
imaging, preferably MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), 
is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing 
RPLS, discontinue VELCADE. The safety of reinitiating 
VELCADE therapy in patients previously experiencing 
RPLS is not known." 
RPLS was also added in section 4.8 of the SmPC as an 
adverse reaction from post-marketing experience with a 
frequency "not known".

Further to the conduct of the cumulative review, it was 
also considered that there is sufficient evidence to 
support that Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is an 
adverse drug reaction associated with the use of 
Velcade and was consequently added in section 4.8 of

Based on the reviewed data, the CHMP considered that 
the observed pulmonary drug-induced disease 
confirmed that the benefit of Velcade in patients with 
acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease did not 
outweigh the risk. The contraindication in patients with 
ADIPD represents the best way to prevent adverse and 
fatal events. Furthermore, it was agreed to amend the 
current warning on pulmonary disorders in section 4.4 
of the SPC to provide recommendation on the treatment 
and clinical actions to be put in place. 
In addition, based on the review of cardiac disorders 
and serious adverse events associated with fluid 
retention, the CHMP considered that Velcade should be 
contraindicated in patients with pericardial disease. 
Section 4.8 of the SPC has also been updated with a

In a drug-drug interaction study based on data from 17 
patients, assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent 
CYP2C19-inhibitor, there was no significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib. 
Patients should be closely monitored when given 
bortezomib in combination with CYP2C19-inhibitors (e.g. 
fluoxetine). 
In the absence of drug-drug interaction studies 
investigating the effect of CYP3A4-inducers on the PK of 
bortezomib, patients should be closely monitored when 
given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4-
inducers (e.g. rifampicin).

The MAH applied for a type II variation to update 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
Labelling and 
sections 4.2 and  4.4 of the SPC with more information 
PL 
regarding 'motor neuropathy'. The CHMP considered 
that in order to try to identify patients at risk of 
neuropathy, a diagnostic approach that would include a 
neurological assessment seems to be necessary, 
especially in those patients experiencing new or 
worsening peripheral neuropathy. 
Further, section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated with 
information regarding a potential interaction with 
cytarabine. In a clinical trial, two patients given high-
dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous

infusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and VELCADE 
for relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia died of ARDS 
early in the course of therapy. Therefore, this specific 
regimen with concomitant administration with high-dose 
cytarabine (2g/m2 per day) by continuous infusion over 
24 hours is not recommended. 
Section 4.8 of the SPC has been updated with reference 
ot the ADRs 'hepes zoster (including disseminated)', 
'ophthalmic herpes', 'herpes meningoencephalitis', 
'autonomic neuropathy' and 'angiooedema'.  
Further, section 5.2 of the SPC has been updated with 
the results of Study M34103-058 on clinical 
pharmacokinetics as follows: 
"Following intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 
mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to eleven patients with 
multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values 
greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose maximum 
plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 
ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent doses, mean 
maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 
67 to 106 ng/ml for the 1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 
ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose. The mean elimination 
half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 
40-193 hours. Bortezomib is eliminated more rapidly 
following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. 
Mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h 
following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 
mg/m2, respectively, and ranged f

CHMP, to include further pulmonary safety information 
in section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SPC) and to update section 4.8 of the SPC with the 
following ADRs: "pneumonitis", "interstitial pneumonia", 
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)", 
"encephalopathy", "cardiac tamponade", "ischemic 
colitis" and "liver failure".  In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the addresses of the local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
With reference to pulmonary disorders, there have been 
rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary 
disease of unknown aetiology such as pneumonitis,

receiving VELCADE. Some of these events have been 
fatal. A higher proportion of these events has been 
reported in Japan. In the event of new or worsening 
pulmonary symptoms, a prompt diagnostic evaluation 
should be performed and patients treated appropriately. 
The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations submitted by the MAH and 
having re-assessed the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, recommended that no amendment of 
Annexes I and III of the Commission Decision is 
necessary and that the marketing authorisation remains

The MAH applied for an update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SPC to include additional information regarding 
hepatic and cardiac adverse events resulting from 
ongoing safety monitoring. 
A warning on "Hepatic Reactions" was added: 
"Rare cases of acute liver failure have been reported in 
patients receiving multiple concomitant medications and 
with serious underlying medical conditions. Other 
reported hepatic reactions include asymptomatic 
increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and 
hepatitis. Such changes may be reversible upon 
discontinuation of bortezomib." 
The ADR "uncommon hyperbilirubinaemia" was added to 
Hepatobiliary disorders and "rare liver failure" to post-

marketing experience information in section 4.8. 
Further, the warning in section 4.4 on "Heart failure" 
was amended and now reads: 
"Acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart 
failure, and/or new onset of decreased left ventricular 
ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib 
treatment. In a phase III randomized, comparative 
study the incidence of heart failure in the VELCADE 
group was similar to that in the dexamethasone group.  
Fluid retention may be a predisposing factor for signs 
and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors 
for or existing heart disease should be closely 
monitored." 
Finally, the ADR "Rare new onset of decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction" was added to cardiac 
disorders in Section 4.8.

The MAH applied for an update of SPC section 4.9 
"Overdosage" to include additional information following 
the assessment of the first PSUR and further to new 
non-clinical data on an investigational model (in vitro 
and in vivo), which are relevant to the clinical overdose 
situation. In line with the current Guideline on SPCs, 
references to the animal models have been included in 
SPC section 5.3.

Two cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in 
monkeys and dogs show that IV doses approximately 
two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a 
mg/m2 basis are associated with increases in heart rate, 
decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In 
dogs the decreased cardiac contractility and hypotension 
responded to acute intervention with positive inotropic 
or pressor agents. Moreover, in dog studies, an increase 
in the corrected QT interval was observed. 
In patients, overdosage more than twice the 
recommended dose has been associated with the acute 
onset of symptomatic hypotension and 
thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes.  
There is no known specific antidote for VELCADE 
overdosage. In the event of an overdosage, the 
patient's vital signs should be monitored and 
appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood 
pressure (such as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic 
agents) and body temperature.

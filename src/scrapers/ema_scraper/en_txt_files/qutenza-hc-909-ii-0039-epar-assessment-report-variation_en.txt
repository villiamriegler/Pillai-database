2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Qutenza is a capsaicin (8% w/w) cutaneous patch.  Capsaicin is a selective agonist of the transient 
receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TR PV1). The TR PV1 receptors, which are located in the skin, are 
ligand-gated, non-selective cation channels preferentially expressed on small diameter sensory neurons, 
especially nociceptors that specialise in the detection of painful or noxious sensations. Qutenza 
(capsaicin) promotes the ‘desensitisation’ or ‘defunctionalisation’ of the cutaneous nociceptors that 
become less sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including further capsaicin exposure or thermal stimuli. 
Sensation from non TR PV1-expressing cutaneous nerves is expected to remain unaltered, including the 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 5/63 
 
 
 
 
 
ability to detect mechanical and vibratory stimuli. Capsaicin-induced alterations in cutaneous nociceptors 
are reversible. 
A Marketing Authorization (MA) has been granted by the European Commission in May 2009, for Qutenza 
cutaneous patch for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic adults either alone or in 
combination with other medicinal pain products. The approved indication excluded patients with diabetes 
on the grounds that insufficient data for this population were included in the original MAA.  
Accordingly, the MAH (Marketing Authorisation Holder) was asked to characterise efficacy and long-term 
safety in this population as a Follow-up Measure No. 001, witch consisted of the following 2 studies: 
E05-CL-3004: A phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of QUTENZA in subjects with Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (short title: 
STEP) and  E05-CL-3002: A randomized, controlled, long-term safety study evaluating the effect of 
repeated applications of QUTENZA plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in subjects with 
Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (short title: PACE).  
Following the completion of the aforementioned studies, their results are submitted by the MAH in the 
type II variation application to extend the currently authorised indication to include patients with 
diabetes. The proposed indication is: “Qutenza is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic 
pain in adults either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain.” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant did not submit an updated Environmental Risk Assessment. Taking into account, that the 
active substance of this medicinal product, capsaicin is a natural substance (found in chilli peppers), the 
CHMP agreed that an update to the environmental risk assessment is not necessary.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that capsaicin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic studies were submitted with this application.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic studies were submitted with this application.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Although no PD studies were submitted, CHMP considered particular safety concerns in the diabetic 
population related to symptoms called “diabetic foot” which may easily develop following skin lesions. 
Patients who have decreased sensory sensitivity towards sharp and thermal stimuli may be at increased 
risk of developing skin lesions. Therefore, the Applicant was requested to address the feasibility of a lower 
dose capsaicin patch and provide a literature overview of the efficacy and safety of lower concentration 
capsaicin in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, further discussion of pharmacodynamic 
effects in terms of epidermal nerve fibre density and function was requested in the target population. The 
MAH provided a detailed literature overview of the use of lower capsaicin products in peripheral painful 
diabetic neuropathy patients which showed that the results with lower dose local capsaicin are 
inconclusive. The MAH further argued that lower concentration capsaicin products have to be applied 3-5 
times per day for longer periods which results in contamination of the patient’s environment. This was 
agreed by the CHMP. 
Regarding pharmacodynamic effects, some studies indicated that low-dose capsaicin may result in more 
pronounced epidermal denervation and slower regeneration in neuropathic patients with diabetes than in 
diabetic patients without neuropathy and in control patients. The rationale behind this observation may 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 7/63 
 
 
 
 
 
be that tissue regeneration in general can be impaired in diabetic patients, particularly if they have 
complicated disease (e.g. with neuropathy, macro- or microangiopathy). However, clinical endpoints 
were not investigated in these studies and it was not entirely clear how these pharmacodynamic 
observations translate into clinical manifestations.  Inconclusive results were also obtained for 
neurosensory changes in patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy following topical capsaicin 
application. While some studies found decreased warmth perception, others failed to demonstrate a 
decrease in sensory functions and neurovascular control. In summary, an increased risk of decreased 
regeneration of sensory functions cannot be excluded. However, based on the results of Qutenza STEP 
and PACE studies, the CHMP concluded that this risk can be managed with routine risk minimization 
measures. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. This was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Regarding desensitisation of capsaicin sensitive nerve endings,  which may be a particular concern in the 
diabetic population,  the MAH provided adequate justification that the benefit/risk of lower concentration 
products are inconclusive and the risks of desensitisation may be sufficiently minimised with routine risk 
minimisation measures. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Qutenza in Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (PDPN)is primarily based on the data 
from the pivotal STEP study; a double-blind study to assess the efficacy of Qutenza compared with 
placebo in patients with PDPN. The primary objective of the supportive, open-label PACE study was to 
provide long-term safety data in patients with PDPN; long-term efficacy was a secondary objective.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Dose-response studies were not performed. Posology in STEP study was based on earlier studies 
conducted to support the neuropathic pain indication. The rationale for the 30 minutes application time in 
the PDPN studies was to keep the mode of administration of Qutenza in accordance with the approved 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
A Phase III, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study Evaluating the 
Efficacy and Safety of Qutenza in Subjects with Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy 
(STEP). Study ID: E05-CL-3004. 
Methods 
Study design 
It was a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive a single 
Qutenza or placebo patch application to the feet for 30 minutes at the baseline visit. Patients were 
observed for 12 weeks following the patch application, involving visits at week 2, 4, 8 and 12.

Antidiabetic medication (including insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of a single application of Qutenza compared to that of placebo in reducing 
pain intensity in subjects with Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (PDPN) 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 10/63 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives: 
To evaluate the efficacy of a single application of Qutenza compared to that of placebo as measured 
by: responder rates, improvement in sleep interference, improvement in overall patient status, 
improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), treatment satisfaction and safety and 
tolerability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary variable: 
The percent change in the average daily pain score (question 5 of the Brief Pain 
Inventory-Diabetic Neuropathy (BPI-DN): “average pain for the past 24 hours”: from the average 
assessed during the baseline run-in period to the average daily pain score assessed between 
weeks 2 and 8 in the active arm compared to the placebo arm. 
Secondary efficacy variables: 
• 
• 
Percent change in the average daily pain score (question 5 of the BPI-DN) from the average 
assessed during the baseline run-in period to the average daily pain score assessed between 
weeks 2 and 12. 
Percent change of weekly average of “average pain for the past 24 hours” NPRS scores from 
baseline at every week after baseline. 
•  Weekly average of “average pain for the past 24 hours” NPRS scores at baseline and every week 
after baseline. 
•  Occurrence of 30% and 50% decrease in the average daily pain score (question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
from baseline to week 2 and 8 and from week 2 average to week 12 
•  Overall patient status using Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire at weeks 
2, 8 and 12 
•  Change in the European Quality of Life Questionnaire in 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) total score and 
Depression and Anxiety scores on the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) from 
baseline to weeks 2, 8 and 12 
• 
• 
Treatment satisfaction using the Self-Assessment of Treatment (SAT) questionnaire at baseline, 
weeks 8 and 12 
Percent change in the sleep interference NPRS score (question 9F of the BPI-DN) from baseline to 
between week 2 and 8 and week 2 and 12 (i.e., average of scores during weeks 2 to 8 and 2 to 
12, compared to baseline). 
The Patient Reported Outcome instruments used in the study (BPI-DN, EQ-5D, PGIC, SAT and HADS) 
were all validated questionnaires.  
Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) was self-report questionnaire specifically designed to 
evaluate the different symptoms of neuropathic pain. The questionnaire comprised a list of 10 descriptors 
(plus 2 temporal items) reflecting spontaneous ongoing or paroxysmal pain, evoked pain and 
dysesthesia/paraesthesia. Each of these items is quantified on a (0 to 10) numerical scale. It can be used 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 11/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to allow discrimination and quantification of 5 distinct clinically relevant dimensions of neuropathic pain 
syndromes.  NPSI was used to characterize subgroups of neuropathic pain patients and to explore 
whether they respond differently to Qutenza and was performed at the baseline visit and at the End of 
Study (EoS) Visit. 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated with a Student’s t-test at the two-sided 0.05 significance level assuming 
a standard deviation (SD) of 33% to provide 90% power to detect a 12% difference in NPRS scores from 
baseline to week 2-8 between treatment arms. This required 160 subjects per group for a total of 320 
subjects. As the expected drop-out rate was approx. 10%, 360 subjects were planned to be randomised. 
Randomisation 
Randomization ratio was 1:1. Randomisation was stratified by investigational site. 
Blinding (masking) 
Given that the application of the active capsaicin patch often, but not invariably, results in pain and 
erythema, the following measures were taken to maintain the study blind: 
• 
• 
The physician/ delegate conducting the clinical assessments and who had access to, and the 
responsibility to record subjects’ efficacy and safety data was independent from the physician/ 
delegate or nurse who was responsible for the application of the patch(es). 
The physician/ delegate conducting the clinical assessments and who had access to, and the 
responsibility to record subjects’ efficacy and safety data was independent from the physician/ 
delegate or nurse who was responsible for the dermal assessments at baseline (both before and 
after patch application). 
•  Results from the dermal assessments at baseline were recorded on paper and sealed in an 
envelope and therefore not be disclosed to any site staff apart from the physician/delegate who 
performed the dermal assessments 
• 
• 
The application site was covered using stretchable socks during patch application and for 24 
hours subsequent to removal of the patch (to prevent the patient from identifying erythema) 
Instructions to the patient stressed that they may or may not experience pain during or after the 
application of the patch 
•  All subjects were pre-treated with EMLA containing lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% in order 
to limit the experience of pain and discomfort. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy variable was the average daily pain score between Week 2-8. A repeated measures 
ANCOVA model was used for these inferential analyses. The model included treatment, week (set of 
[week 2,…, week 12]), treatment by week interaction, gender, pain score at baseline, HbA1c at screening 
and site as factors/covariates. A compound symmetry structure was used to model the covariance 
structure. Mean (±95% CI) of percent change from baseline in weekly averages of daily pain scores 
(including between weeks 2 and 8 and weeks 2 and 12) were presented graphically by treatment group. 
Patients achieving a 30% decrease in the average daily pain score between weeks 2 and 8 were analysed 
as:

The number and percentage of patients achieving this reduction [SEV]   
A p-value, an LS mean estimate and a CI, reported for the odds ratio (OR) of QUTENZA and

A logistic regression model was used for these inferential analyses. The model included 
treatment, gender, pain score at baseline, HbA1c at screening and site as factors/covariates. 
To explore the effect of 2 important covariates on the primary endpoint, 2 additional ANCOVA analyses 
were performed:  An ANCOVA model with treatment, gender, pain score at baseline and PDPN duration as 
factors/covariates and ANCOVA model with treatment, gender, pain score at baseline and NPSI total 
score at baseline as factors/covariates.

Protocol deviations occurred in 106 patients, the majority of them were due to receiving excluded 
concomitant treatment and procedures inadvertently not (or incorrectly) performed. In both treatment 
arms, a comparable number of patients deviated from the study protocol for at least 1 reason and a 
comparable number of deviations was observed.  
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline data are presented in Table 1 below.  
Table 1 Demography and baseline characteristics, safety analysis set 
The treatment arms were similar with respect to all baseline characteristics with the exception of gender; 
more males were enrolled in to the study overall (58.3%) and there was a higher proportion in the 
Qutenza arm (61.3%) than in the placebo arm (55.2%). 
Numbers analysed 
The overview of numbers analysed is presented in Table 2 below. The safety analysis set included all 
randomized patients who received study patch application (grouped by actual treatment received). The 
intention to treat set included all randomized patients who received study patch application (grouped by

Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
The robustness of the primary endpoint results was demonstrated using either BOCF imputation or 
repeated measures mixed model analysis with either AutoRegressive 1 (AR 1) or unstructured UN 
covariance structures. Missing values were considered missing at random in the repeated measures 
mixed model; therefore, no active imputation was needed for this model analysis. 
As shown in Table 4 below, the results were consistent with those for the primary analysis.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Percent Change in the Average Daily Pain Score (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) (between weeks 2 and 12)  
Patients treated with Qutenza had a greater reduction in pain from baseline to between weeks 2 and 12 
(BLOCF) compared with placebo (p = 0.018). 
Percent Change of Average Pain Score by Week (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
Clear separation could be observed between the Qutenza and placebo, starting at week 3 to the end of the 
study (week 12). Estimated differences per week varied between 6.3% (week 6) to 9% (week 12) with 
supporting p-values varying between 0.051 (week 6) and 0.005 (week 12). The week by week 
comparison showed that the primary analysis result was based on a consistent improvement over time till 
the end of the study. 
30% Reduction in Average Pain Score (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
More patients treated with Qutenza achieved at least a 30% reduction in average daily pain score from 
baseline to between weeks 2 and 8 (39.8%) compared with placebo (32.8%) (p=0.108). 
In addition, more patients treated with Qutenza achieved at least a 30% reduction in average daily pain 
score from baseline to between weeks 2 and 12 (40.9%) compared with placebo (31.7%; p=0.050)  
50% Reduction in Average Pain Score (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
The 50% responder rate was achieved for 21% of patients in the Qutenza arm compared with 18.0%) in 
the placebo arm (either for weeks 2 to 8 or weeks 2 to 12 (p = 0.403 and p = 0.446 respectively).  
Time to Treatment Effect 
Time to treatment effect was defined as the time taken for patients to first experience a 30% reduction in 
pain for 3 consecutive days. The median time to pain relief for the ITT data set was numerically shorter for 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015

the Qutenza arm; 19 days (95% CI: 12.0, 37.0) versus 72 days (95% CI: 19.0, not reached) for the 
placebo arm.  
Sleep Interference (Question 9F of the BPI-DN) 
Patients treated with Qutenza had a greater mean percent (SD) reduction in sleep interference score from 
baseline to between weeks 2 and 8 (-33.12 [33.68]) compared with patients treated with placebo (-24.15 
[45.02]; p = 0.030) 
Patient Global Impression of Change 
for the overall status of patients (PGIC self-assessment), from week 8 onwards, a greater proportion of 
patients reported they were either very much improved or much improved in the Qutenza arm compared 
to the placebo arm (week 8: 39.4% versus 30.2%; and week 12: 40.5% vs 29.7%, respectively)  
European Quality of Life Questionnaire in 5 Dimensions 
The increases in the EQ-5D scores have shown a small numerical difference in favour of QUTENZA 
compared to placebo. 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
For the ITT and PPS analysis sets, the mean change from baseline in HADS were similar in both treatment 
groups for the anxiety and depression subscale total scores at all timepoints.  
Self-Assessment of Treatment (SAT) 
At week 8 there were no statistically significant differences observed between treatment groups based on 
the rating of any of the self-assessment questions. 
At week 12, for the following questions, there was evidence of an association between treatment and 
outcome favouring QUTENZA: 
•  Over the past 7 days, how much has the study treatment improved your pain level? – a greater 
proportion of patients in the Qutenza arm (17.5%) compared with (8.2%) in the placebo arm 
reported their pain level was “quite a bit better” and a greater proportion of patients in the 
Qutenza arm (13.9%) compared with (7.0%) in the placebo arm reported their pain level was 
“moderately better”. 
•  Over the past 7 days, how much has the study treatment improved the following aspects of your 
life; emotional wellbeing, such as mood, temperament or outlook on life? – a lower proportion of 
patients reported “not at all” in the Qutenza arm (41.6%) compared with the placebo arm 
(59.1%) and a larger proportion of patients reported they were “slightly better”, “moderately 
better” and “quite a bit better” in the Qutenza arm (20.5%, 16.3% and 12.0%) than in the 
placebo arm (14.0%, 9.9% and 8.8%). 
The association between treatment and outcome favouring Qutenza as decribed above for the 12-week 
analysis was also observed for the end of study (BLOCF, ITT) analysis. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis  
Patients were allocated to 1 of 5 dimensions of the NPSI according to their highest subscale/dimension 
score. The following order (the order in which the items appear in the calculation manual) were used for 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 18/63 
 
 
 
 
 
allocation: 1) evoked pain; 2) pressing (deep) spontaneous pain; 3) paroxysmal pain; 4) 
paresthesia/dysesthesia; and 5) burning (superficial) spontaneous pain. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the potential impact of maximum NPSI dimension/subscale, 
age, gender, race, site, baseline average daily pain score category, duration of PDPN and screening 
HbA1c value on the mean percent change in average daily pain score from baseline to the primary 
analysis period (weeks 2 to 8). In general, subgroups were only analysed descriptively, with the exception 
of gender and site which were added to the primary ANCOVA model as covariates. 
There were no subgroup differences for age, gender, race, site, baseline average daily pain category, 
duration of PDPN or screening HbA1c value. Subgroup differences were identified for the NPSI 
dimension/subscale. 
The results of the subgroup analysis of the maximum NPSI dimension/subscale showed the mean (SD) 
percent change from baseline to between weeks 2 and 8 (BLOCF) daily pain score for patients with 
paroxysmal pain was -32.49 (30.86) in the Qutenza arm compared with -17.32 (25.28) in the placebo 
arm. The mean (SD) percent change from baseline to between weeks 2 and 8 (BLOCF) daily pain score for 
patients with paresthesia/dysesthesia was -30.37 (28.41) in the active arm compared with -23.29 
(31.05) in the placebo arm. In both treatment groups the absolute mean percent change from baseline to 
between weeks 2 and 8 was greater than seen for the ITT population. The mean percent change from 
baseline to between weeks 2 and 8 (BLOCF) daily pain score for patients with burning (superficial) 
spontaneous pain was similar to that seen for the ITT population. For the evoked pain and pressing (deep) 
spontaneous pain subgroups there was notably no difference between the Qutenza and placebo arms and 
improvement in pain was not as pronounced as in the ITT population particularly in the pressing (deep) 
spontaneous pain subgroup where overall mean (SD) percent change was -17.47 (23.99) compared with 
-24.17 (28.02) for the ITT population. The numbers of patients in each subgroup based on maximum 
NPSI pain with the exception of paresthesia/dysesthesia were low (< 50 patients) and therefore results 
should be interpreted with caution.  
“Functional unblinding”  
To investigate the potential for unblinding in patients who experienced a local reaction and whether the 
evidence of efficacy was compromised by unblinding of treatment allocation that may affect the patient’s 
perception and reporting of pain, additional analyses were performed. Figure 3 below is based on numeric 
pain rating score (NPRS) scores in patients with and without application site reactions in STEP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 19/63 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3 Treatment Effect of Qutenza in STEP by patients who had and had not application site 
reaction ( pain in extremity, application site pain or burning sensation)  
At week 12, patients on Qutenza experienced a greater percentage reduction in NPRS scores, compared 
to patients on placebo, regardless of the application site reaction. This observation was in contrast to 
what was observed at week 1, where the percentage reduction in the NPRS score was numerically greater 
for patients on placebo.  
Concomitant medications 
Pain medications taken at or after baseline 
74.0% of patients took pain medications at or after baseline; a similar proportion of patients received 
them in each treatment arm. Rescue pain medications (for pain caused by patch application) were taken 
by 12.2% of patients overall with more patients in the Qutenza arm taking them than in the placebo arm. 
8.4% of patients took opioids at or after baseline . The proportion of patients using opioid medications for 
pain at or after baseline was larger in the Qutenza arm compared with the placebo arm; opioids were 
taken both as rescue medication and for other reasons later in the study.  
Pain medications taken at or after baseline were comparable between the treatment arms; 76.3% 
patients in the Qutenza and 71.6% of patients in the placebo arm. The most commonly used were within 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 20/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the chemical subgroup “other analgesics and antipyretics” (72 patients [38.7%] in the Qutenza arm and 
82 patients [44.8%] in the placebo arm), “other antiepileptics” (72 patients [38.7%] in the Qutenza arm 
and 82 patients [44.8%] in the placebo arm) and “propionic acid derivatives” (49 patients [26.3%] in the 
Qutenza arm and 38 patients [20.8%] in the placebo arm). 
Rescue medication: 
Rescue pain medication was defined as all pain medication that a patient was taking between day 1 and 
day 5 after patch application treatment. Overall, a larger proportion of rescue pain medications for pain 
caused by patch application were taken by patients in the Qutenza arm (35 patients [18.8%]), compared 
with the placebo arm (10 patients [5.5%]). Within 7 days preceding the patch application visit the subject 
should not have used any oral, transdermal or parenteral opioids, regardless of dose. Overall, the 
proportion of patients using opioid medications for pain at or after baseline was larger in the Qutenza arm 
(20 patients [10.8%]) compared with the placebo arm (11 patients [6.0%]).  
Additional analysis was performed to investigate analgesic use in patients experiencing application site 
reactions. The pattern od use is presented in Table 5 below.  
Table 5 Analgesic Use in STEP by Adverse Event Experiencing Application Site Reactions 
To investigate the impact of any bias on the estimated treatment effect due to analgesics use, a 
sensitivity analysis was performed. The sensitivity analysis was a variation of the primary analysis, 
excluding any pain scores that might have been influenced by the use of analgesics from week 2 onwards.  
The results are summarised in Table 6 below.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The effects of Qutenza in PDPN versus PHN and HIV-AN were compared across a range of approaches that 
included the percentage change from baseline in the average of daily pain scores between weeks 2 and 8, 
the percentage change from baseline to end of study (week 12), responder analysis (patients with either 
= 30% or = 50% [average] reduction on Numeric Pain Rating Scale [NPRS]) over 2 to 8 weeks or at end 
of study (week 12). End of study (week 12) was the only common endpoint across studies and was 
chosen for the comparison of efficacy between the populations studied. The main results summarized in 
Table 8 and 9 show that the magnitude of effect of Qutenza in PDPN versus PHN and HIV-AN across these 
parameters was consistent.

The clinical relevance of the observed effect of Qutenza was also evaluated in comparison with other 
agents indicated for the treatment of PDPN. To this end, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted 
to assess the treatment effect of Qutenza in PDPN compared with other treatment options (pregabalin, 
gabapentin, duloxetine and amitriptyline).  The point estimates of the absolute treatment effects from the 
random effects model are presented in Figure 4 and the results of the fixed effects model are presented 
in Figure 5.

Only 9 PDPN-studies reported the number of patients with at least 30% pain reduction. Eight of them and 
the Qutenza STEP trial were included in the base case analysis; one trial was of too short duration (5 
weeks) compared to the other studies and was excluded. A significant difference of Qutenza compared to 
placebo, numerical advantages of Qutenza compared to pregabalin and gabapentin, and parity of 
Qutenza to duloxetine have been shown. Pregabalin and gabapentin were performing better than placebo 
with corresponding 95% credibility intervals indicating no significant differences. (Table 10)

Methods 
The PACE study was an open label, long-term safety study (52-week) assessing the safety of repeated 
Qutenza treatment for 30 minutes plus standard of care (SOC) medication, versus Qutenza treatment for 
60 minutes plus SOC medication versus SOC medication alone. Patients and investigators were not 
blinded to treatment but physicians assessing neurological function were.

Adult, male or female patients with painful, distal, symmetric, sensorimotor polyneuropathy due to 
diabetes, for at least 1 year prior to the screening visit were eligible for enrolment in this study.  Diagnosis 
of PDPN had to be confirmed by a score of at least 3 on the MNSI and the average Numeric Pain Rating

Scale (NPRS) score over the last 24 hours should have been ≥  4 at the screening and the baseline visit. 
Patients should have stable glycemic control for at least 6 months prior to the screening visit, i.e., on 
antidiabetic drugs (including insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents).  At least 1 medical record of 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≤  9% at 3 to 6 months before screening visit and an HbA1c of ≤  9% 
at screening visit was required. Similar exclusion criteria were applied as in the STEP study.  
The following concomitant medications were permitted during the study: 
• 
Patients received a topical anaesthetic, EMLA prior to placement of Qutenza patches. 
•  A short-acting analgesic (including short-acting opioid if required) could be administered to 
relieve treatment-associated discomfort during the treatment procedure and for up to 5 
consecutive days post-treatment. 
•  Any pain medications used as SOC in PDPN as per the investigator’s discretion.  
•  Aspirin up to 325 mg/day for the prevention of ischemia. 
•  Anti-diabetic medication (including insulin and oral antidiabetics) 
•  Other medical therapy not specifically prohibited (e.g., statins, fibric acid derivatives, etc.). 
• 
Patients could receive oral and transdermal opioid medication if it did not exceed a total oral daily 
dose of morphine of 80 mg or the equivalent, which was to be calculated using the Opioid Dose 
Worksheet. Any changes, additions or discontinuations to medications were assessed and 
recorded at every study visit. 
•  Cooling measures, such as cool packs, a light wrapping of gauze misted with cool water or a fan 
were permitted only after patch removal. 
There was no primary efficacy endpoint in this long term safety study. The secondary efficacy endpoints 
included: 
•  Change from baseline to end of study in average pain (Question 5 of the BPI-DN), Pain Severity 
Index, and Pain Interference Index;  
•  Change from baseline to end of study in Questions 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9a to g of the BPI-DN;  
• 
• 
Time to effect of BPI-DN Question 5 (average pain); 
PGIC,  
•  HRQOL by assessing the change from baseline to end of study in the EQ-5D;  
•  Change from baseline to end of study in SAT; 
•  Change in use of concomitant medications from screening visit to planned or early termination.

Table 10 Summary of demographics and baseline characteristics (Safety Analysis Set) 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. All patients used 
medication prior to baseline. The use of prior treatment, including pain medications and SOC for PDPN, 
was balanced between treatment groups.  
A total of 468 patients were randomized into the study, comprising the Safety Analysis Set (SAF).  All 
randomized patients in the Qutenza arms received treatment. Most patients completed the study; a total 
of 17.1% of patients discontinued the study post baseline, the most common reason for study 
discontinuation was withdrawal of consent.  
Efficacy outcomes 
Percent Change in Average Pain Score (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
A reduction in average pain, based on the BPI-DN scores, was observed from baseline to the end of the 
study in the Qutenza (30 minutes; -2.0), Qutenza (60 minutes; -2.3), and SOC (-1.1) arms. Patients 
treated with Qutenza had a greater reduction in average pain compared to the SOC alone arm, as shown 
in Figures 7 and 8  and Table 11 below.

30% Reduction in Average Pain Score (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
67.3% of patients in the Qutenza 30 minutes arm and 67.5% patients in the Qutenza 60 minutes arm had 
at least a 30% reduction in average pain compared with the SOC alone arm (40.6%). Of those patients, 
a greater proportion showed a 30% reduction in average pain at month 1 in the Qutenza 30 minutes arm 
(28.6%) and Qutenza 60 minutes arm (22.6%) compared with the SOC alone arm (14.3%)  
50% Reduction in Average Pain Score (Question 5 of the BPI-DN) 
44.8% of patients in the Qutenza 30 minutes arm and 48.4% of patients in Qutenza 60 minutes arm had 
at least a 50% reduction in average pain compared with the SOC alone arm (23.8%). Of those patients, 
20% in the Qutenza 30 minutes arm, and 21.1% in the Qutenza 60 minutes arm showed a 50% reduction 
in average pain at month 1 while no patients demonstrated this effect in the SOC alone arm. 
Time to loss of effect 
During the study, loss of treatment effect (time to treatment failure) was observed in a comparable 
proportion of patients in the Qutenza 30 minutes arm (15.4%), Qutenza 60 minutes arm (12.1%) and the 
SOC alone arm (12.9%). Loss of treatment effect was first observed at month 3 in the Qutenza 60 
minutes arm (26.3%) and the SOC alone arm (5.0%) and at month 4 in the Qutenza 30 minutes arm 
(16.7%). However, loss of treatment effect occurred in no more than 5 patients in each month from 
month 3 to month 13. 
Time to treatment effect and loss of treatment effect pain were analyzed by whether SOC medication was 
used or not in combination with Qutenza at baseline, and stable or not stable SOC medication in 
combination with Qutenza throughout the first 2 months. There were no relevant differences between the 
analysis groups, and the results were consistent with the main analysis. 
Percent Change in Pain Severity Index 
A reduction in pain severity, based on the BPI-DN scores, was observed from baseline to up to 12 months 
in the Qutenza 30 minutes ( -1.9), Qutenza 60 minutes (-2.2), and SOC alone (-0.9) arms. Patients 
treated with Qutenza had a greater reduction in pain severity compared with SOC alone. Patients in the 
Qutenza arms showed sustained improvement in pain severity from baseline to month 1 and up to 12 
months, and greater improvements compared with the SOC alone arm.  
Change in Pain Scores 
A greater improvement in BPI-DN pain scores, assessing daily pain, pain right now, and pain interference, 
were observed from baseline to up to 12 months in the Qutenza arms compared with the SOC alone arm, 
as shown in Table 12 below.

Patient Global Impression of Change 
A greater improvement in PGIC was observed in the Qutenza arms compared with the SOC alone arm at 
the end of the study. The overall status of patients was ‘very much improved, much improved or 
minimally improved’ in approximately 70% of patients in the Qutenza arms compared with 38.5% in the 
SOC alone arm.

European Quality of Life Questionnaire in 5 Dimensions 
A greater improvement in EQ-5D visual analog scale score was observed from baseline to the end of study 
in the Qutenza 30 minutes (10.4) and Qutenza 60 minutes (11.2) arms compared with the SOC alone arm 
(5.5).  
SAT Results 
At the end of the study, a greater proportion of patients in the Qutenza arms reported improvements in 
pain level, activity level, and quality of life, based on the SAT questionnaire, compared with the SOC alone 
arm.  
The observed improvements in average pain, pain severity and pain interference were maintained 
throughout the 12 month duration of the study. 
Rescue medication 
The proportion of patients who used rescue medication after Qutenza treatment was comparable in the 
Qutenza 30 minutes arm (22.4%) with the Qutenza 60 minutes arm (29.9%). The types of medication 
used, and the proportions of patients using them were comparable between Qutenza arms. 
Use of concomitant medications 
A decrease in medication use was not observed in any of the treatment arms from baseline to the end of 
the study. Around one third of patients were using antiepileptic drugs at baseline across treatment arms. 
In the Qutenza arms, the proportion of patients using antiepileptics at the end of the study was 
comparable with the proportion reported at baseline. In contrast, at the end of the study, the proportion 
of patients using antiepileptic drugs had increased by > 10% in the SOC alone arm. Use of 
antidepressants and opioids was relatively low (< 20%) and fairly comparable from baseline to the end of 
study in the Qutenza arms. Small increases were observed in antidepressant and opioid use in the SOC 
alone group from baseline to the end of study. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
STEP  and  PACE  clinical  trials  have  been  conducted  in  diabetic  patients  diagnosed  with  painful  distal 
symmetrical polyneuropathy for at least 1 year. In STEP, patients were required to have a glycosylated 
hemoglobin  (HbA1c)  value  ≤  11%  and  in  PACE  ≤  9%.  Patients  were  allowed  to  remain  on  stable 
background analgesic medication. Given these characteristics, patients enrolled in STEP and PACE studies 
can be considered to be representative of the target PDPN patient population.  
The efficacy of Qutenza was evaluated using uni-dimensional pain scales and multi-dimensional 
assessment tools, in accordance with the Guideline on Clinical Medicinal Products Intended for the 
Treatment of Neuropathic Pain (CPMP/EWP/252/03 Rev. 1). The protocols were reviewed and endorsed 
by the CHMP.  
In studies submitted with the original MAA, low-dose (0.004%) capsaicin patch was used as a comparator 
to assure blinding conditions. In the STEP study, however, an inert placebo patch without any active 
substance was used, as placebo response can be considerably higher in the PDPN population than in PHN 
trials. As concluded in the initial MAA procedure, there are strong reasons to believe that the control arm 
used in Qutenza trials contributed to reduce the relative therapeutic effect of the active arms. 
Accordingly, the MAH argued that it is unethical to expose patients to a low concentration capsaicin patch 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 39/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as the control as it will potentially decrease the likelihood that a trial will show superiority of the active 
treatment when a true treatment effect exists, thereby increasing the possibility of a noninformative 
study. This argumentation was endorsed by the CHMP during the initial review of the study protocol, as 
the proposed measures to mitigate the perception of the capsaicin patch application and its impact on 
efficacy evaluation were considered sufficient.  
The study personnel were considered to be adequately blinded. However, the proper blindness of the 
study subjects to the treatments has been questioned. It was stressed that the patient may or may not 
experience burning sensation during treatment and all patients were pre-treated with local anaesthetics. 
Patients were informed about the drug as follows: “…It contains the active substance capsaicin (8%). 
Capsaicin is the substance in chili peppers that gives them their perception of heat. […] The placebo is a 
patch that looks like Qutenza but has no drug or other active ingredient in it….”  therefore the patient was 
aware of the hot nature of the test product. Despite local anaesthetics, covering the application site for 24 
h after removal of patch and verbal reassurance of the subjects (....you may or may not experience 
burning sensation”) more patients with Qutenza patch needed rescue medications (35%) than with 
placebo (10%). Perceiving burning /hot/ painful sensations upon patch application, a patient could 
conclude that they received active treatment. An inert placebo theoretically allows more precise estimate 
of treatment effect but in this specific case the blinding of the subjects may have been of concern, 
especially due to the self-report nature of measures.  
Analgesic use by treatment group and by assessment time point has been provided to assess the possible 
bias on the estimated treatment effect. Two patterns of analgesic use were observed. The first pattern 
related to local site reaction. Understandably, the analgesic use in the Qutenza group was substantially 
larger but also longer than 5 days set as rescue period in the protocol. The second pattern was related to 
a small number of patients who required permanent analgesic use (7 out of 186 patients in Qutenza and 
10 out of 183 in the placebo arm). As the number of patients in this group was very small, the CHMP 
determined that the impact of additional permanent analgesic use on the final outcome is minor.  
It has also been shown that functional unblinding was unlikely as at week 12, patients on Qutenza 
experienced a greater percentage reduction in NPRS scores, compared to patients on placebo, regardless 
of whether or not application site reaction was experienced. The CHMP concluded that the initially higher 
analgesic use was not expected to have had an impact on pain assessment at the end of the trial.   
Distal polyneuropathy typically shows a stocking-and-glove distribution in the distal extremities. The 
symptoms typically start in the toes, gradually ascending to the lower limbs. In advanced cases, it 
spreads to the upper limbs. Since painful diabetic neuropathy is generally localized to lower limbs,  the 
need for application of Qutenza to the upper extremities is likely to be infrequent thus, application in other 
locations were not investigated in the clinical trials.  
Accordingly , the MAH has updated  section 4.4 of the SmPC to state: “Qutenza must be applied to intact, 
non-irritated, dry skin, and allowed to remain in place for 30 minutes for the feet (e.g. HIV-associated 
neuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathic pain) and 60 minutes for other locations (e.g. postherpetic 
neuralgia).” This recommendation has been agreed by the CHMP, considering that feet are the most likely 
location for PDPN. 
The pivotal STEP study was carried out in the US but the results can be extrapolated to the European 
population. The PACE study has been conducted in several regions in Europe and a large difference 
between the regional results has been observed.  The background medication differed between 
geographical regions: in the EU, patients were most likely treated in line with neuropathic pain treatment 
guidelines (i.e. pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, tramadol) while in Russia and particularly in Ukraine 
more emphasis was put on other treatment options,  such as vitamin preparations. Baseline SOC 
treatment was also more frequent in the EU than in Ukraine. Efficacy differed between geographical 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 40/63 
 
 
 
 
regions and was most pronounced in Ukraine (25% of the study population) where the majority of 
patients did not get any SOC. However, if the higher efficacy were due to the lower rate of background 
therapy of neuropathic pain, then it would be higher in patients without SOC treatment and this was not 
the case: for instance in Russia and Ukraine both mean percent change from baseline and responder rates 
were higher in those subjects who took standard of care. Qutenza was favoured over SOC in all regions.  
This suggests that other factors than differences in local SOC may have influenced the different efficacy 
between regions. However, as there was a clear preference towards Qutenza in all regions, the CHMP 
concluded that the regional variation does not impact on the overall validity of the study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Application time of 30 minutes was selected for the STEP study, based on prior results in HIV-AN and PHN 
studies. Additionally, a 60-minute Qutenza application was also evaluated in PACE study in order to obtain 
additional efficacy and safety data for the longer application duration. The safety profile of the 60-minute 
application was comparable to the 30-minute application in the PACE study.  
Although the SOC group needed more anti-depressants and antiepileptics, the need for opioids was 
increased in Qutenza 60 min group. No additional benefit was demonstrated by using the 60-minute 
application. Therefore, the efficacy and safety data support the application of Qutenza for 30 minutes in 
patients with PDPN. 
The treatment difference was statistically significant between Qutenza and placebo for the primary 
endpoint in STEP trial. The difference between the active and placebo arm was relatively small and the 
placebo effect higher compared to prior neuropathy trials. This was in line with literature data. i.e placebo 
response can be higher in the PDPN population than in PHN patients. However, a higher placebo effect 
(than in previous trials) was unexpected since an inert patch has been used instead of a low-dose 
capsaicin control. 
In a recent publication (Christian Martini, et al., Pharmacodynamic analysis of the analgesic effect of 
capsaicin 8% patch (QutenzaTM) in diabetic neuropathic pain patients: detection of distinct response 
groups, Journal of Pain Research 2012:5 51-59) PDPN patients were classified into four groups regarding 
their treatment response to Qutenza. According to the authors, patients who reported significant pain 
relief at week 2 can be classified further as transient responders (Group 3 in the cited publication) or 
responders who have steady response after single a patch (Group 4). Following the CHMP’s request the 
MAH repeated the analysis using the data of STEP and PACE studies. Following Martini et al. [2012], the 
MAH classified patients into four groups: full responders, partial responders with recurrent syndromes, no 
responders with stable syndromes and a group where the patients’ conditions worsen despite the 
treatments. The MAH carried out this analysis only for patients in the Qutenza groups. It was 
hypothesized that the treatment response after the first patch application is predictive regarding the final 
outcome and if a patient does not show any response after the first application then any further treatment 
is a futile attempt. At end of study PACE, patients in each category showed improved pain levels, even the 
5 patients that worsened after their first treatment application. Of the nonresponders after initial 
treatment, more than 50% became a responder after multiple treatments with an average improvement 
of 26%. These results indicate that patients not responding after 1 treatment application may benefit 
from subsequent treatments. The results from the PACE study are also comparable with those reported 
by Martini et al., though fewer patients in PACE showed maximum response with no return. In addition, 
the results from the STEP and PACE studies are very similar, especially when the responder groups are 
combined. In conclusion, the hypothesis with regard to the response categories has been confirmed. 
However, the hypothesis that nonresponders to the initial Qutenza patch application would continue to be 
nonresponders was not confirmed by the data. Instead, in the PACE study more than 50% of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 41/63 
 
 
 
 
 
nonresponders after initial treatment became a responder after multiple treatments with an average 
improvement of 26%. 
The percentage of patients who failed to experience any improvement in pain was consistently less in the 
Qutenza arm than in the placebo arm in the STEP study, and less in Qutenza plus standard of care arm 
compared to standard of care alone arm in the PACE study. The percentage of patients with no response 
at all was generally comparable in STEP (26% at week 12) to those in prior studies. In HIV-AN- and 
PNH-studies 29 % and 18% of patients respectively did not show any change or experienced worsening 
of pain from baseline to week 2-8. 
Evaluation of the week 12 results for the PDPN study with those of the phase 3 studies conducted with 
Qutenza in patients with PHN and HIV-AN were conducted to compare the treatment effects across the 
aetiologies. The 30% responder rates for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy showed 8% difference to 
placebo, with a p=0.049 (borderline significance). The responder rates at 30% level and the magnitude 
of percent reduction of average pain were comparable across approved and PDPN indications. 
The effectiveness of Qutenza in PDPN was further demonstrated by the treatment effect seen with 
multiple applications in the PACE study where a 1.0-point separation on a pain numerical rating scale 
from standard of care after multiple treatments was observed.  
A meta-analysis (a mixed treatment comparison) was presented to compare responder rates in Qutenza 
PDPN study with already approved medications for PDPN (pregabalin, gabapentin and duloxetine) and it 
was shown that Qutenza is as effective as other medications, though due to a smaller sample size the 
confidence interval of the effect size was larger for the Qutenza estimate.  
Pathophysiology of PDPN is multifactorial as diabetes can damage the peripheral nervous system in a 
variety of ways, but the most common presentation is a distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP). Other 
patterns of injury include small fiber predominant neuropathy, radiculoplexopathy, and autonomic 
neuropathy, amongst others. While there are clear differences in the pathophysiology of PDPN, HIV-AN 
and PHN, the qualitative characteristics of the pain overlap between the aetiologies. In all cases the pain 
is neuropathic in origin, arising from injury to peripheral nerves, resulting in peripheral nociceptor 
hyper-excitability and altered central nervous signal processing secondary to changes in afferentation. 
The mechanism of action of capsaicin is considered to be similar in all 3 conditions. Comparable responder 
rates in the presented studies provide evidence that differences in aetiology do not appear to translate 
into a clinically meaningful difference in response to treatment with Qutenza.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results of STEP and PACE studies, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy of Qutenza in the 
treatment of PDPN has been demonstrated.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The purpose of this assessment was to evaluate and compare the safety data collected in studies STEP 
and PACE with the data from the original MAA, which included 12 studies in patients with PHN, HIV-AN 
and PDPN. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 42/63 
 
 
 
 
 
In the studies included in this safety analysis, the Qutenza patch was applied for 30, 60 or 90 minutes, 
depending on the site of application, pain aetiology and study.  
Patient exposure 
The overall safety evaluation was based on 3 study pools.  
Pool 1 (PDPN Patients from STEP and PACE) 
Pool 1 comprised 499 patients and included all patients enrolled into PDPN studies, STEP and PACE, who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug. Pool 1 consisted of Qutenza data only, with no control comparison. 
Pool 2 (Patients Included in the Original Submission Dossier) 
Pool 2 comprised 1615 patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the 12 studies included in 
the original MAA: studies C102, C106, C107, C108, C109, C110, C111, C112, C116, C117, C118 and 
C119. 
A subset of patients in C111 study included PDPN patients.  To allow for the comparison between PDPN 
patients versus non-PDPN patients, the PDPN patients from the C111 study were excluded from Pool 2 
(non-PDPN population of Pool 2) for these analyses, and comprised 1524 patients. Pool 2 consisted of 
Qutenza data only, with no control comparison. 
Pool 3 (Overall Safety Population) 
Pool 3 comprised 2114 patients and provided the overall safety population (combination of all patients in 
Pool l and Pool 2). The results of the pooled studies were presented to enable a comparison of the data 
and to demonstrate their consistency, as well as to provide an assessment of the overall safety. 
Adverse events 
The AEs in this section are described for the STEP and PACE studies; the PDPN population (Pool 1); the 
PDPN population versus the non-PDPN population (Pool 1 versus Pool 2 excluding PDPN patients in the 
C111 study); and the overall safety population (Pool 3), where warranted.  
The summary of adverse events is provided in Tables below.

STEP Study 
In STEP, more patients reported TEAEs in the Qutenza arm (46.8%) compared with the placebo arm 
(33.9%); however, most of the TEAEs reported were attributable to application site reactions, and were 
consistent with the established safety profile of Qutenza. 
The proportion of related TEAEs was higher in the Qutenza arm (34.9%) compared with the placebo arm 
(12.6%); however, this was mainly attributable to the application of the patch. 2 patients in the Qutenza 
arm reported serious AEs (SAEs) (dehydration and convulsion), neither considered related to study drug. 
No patients in the Qutenza arm had a TEAE resulting in discontinuation from the study. 
PACE Study 
In PACE, more patients reported TEAEs in the Qutenza arms (68.4%) compared with the SOC alone arm 
(48.4%), which was mainly attributable to the higher incidence of application site reactions. A 
comparable proportion of patients reported serious TEAEs in the Qutenza arms (10.5%) compared with 
the SOC alone arm (9.7%). 
Less than 10% of patients in the Qutenza arms reported TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of the 
treatment or the study. 
Common Adverse Events 
Pool 1 (PDPN Patients from STEP and PACE) 
As expected, application site reactions were the most common TEAEs; burning sensation, application site 
pain, application site erythema and pain in extremity were the most commonly reported TEAEs in the 
PDPN population (Pool 1). The incidence of hypertension was higher in the Qutenza (60 minutes) arm 
(5.7%) compared to the Qutenza (30 minutes) arm (1.5% without SOC and 1.3% with SOC).  
Pool 1 versus Pool 2 (PDPN Patients versus Non-PDPN Patients) 
Fewer patients in the Qutenza arms reported common TEAEs in the PDPN population (Pool 1; 45.5%) 
compared to the non-PDPN population (Pool 2 excluding PDPN patients in the C111 study; 72.2%). The 
type of common TEAEs were comparable in the PDPN population with the non-PDPN population; fewer 
patients in the PDPN population reported general disorders and administration site conditions compared 
to the non-PDPN population (22.8% and 63.9%, respectively) including application site pain and 
application site erythema. However, erythema, burning sensation, and pain in extremity were more 
commonly reported in PDPN population with burning sensation only being reported in Pool 1 (11% 
patients). 
Comparison of the 30-minute Qutenza application showed that fewer patients reported common TEAEs in 
the PDPN population (Pool 1; 41.5%) compared with the non-PDPN population (Pool 2 excluding PDPN 
patients in the C111 study; 67.1%), which was consistent with the analysis for all application durations. 
Pool 3 (Overall Safety Population) 
Consistent with Pool 1 and Pool 2, the most commonly reported TEAEs in the overall safety population 
(Pool 3) were application site reactions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 47/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment-related events of general disorders and administration site conditions were reported by fewer 
patients in the PDPN population (Pool 1; 22.8%) compared to the non-PDPN population (Pool 2 excluding 
the PDPN patients in the C111 study; 63.9%). Consequently, fewer patients reported related events, by 
Preferred Term, of application site pain (21.6% and 44.4%) and application site erythema (5.2% and 
43.2%) in the PDPN population and non-PDPN population, respectively. 
Burning sensation, pain in extremity and erythema were commonly reported treatment related TEAEs in 
the PDPN population (Pool 1) but not in the non-PDPN population (Pool 2 excluding the PDPN patients in 
Study C111). However, these TEAEs are the expected application site reactions consistent with the safety 
profile of Qutenza. 
Dermal Assessment 
Pool 1 (PDPN Patients from STEP and PACE) 
In the PDPN population (Pool 1), 63.3% of patients had no evidence of irritation following patch 
application (a score of 0 on the dermal assessment scale; an 8-point scale ranging from 0 [no evidence of 
irritation] to 7 [strong reaction spreading beyond the test site]). No patients scored higher than 3. PDPN 
patients who were administered Qutenza alone (i.e., without SOC) and who were administered Qutenza 
for 30 minutes (compared with 60 minutes) reported less irritation. 
Pool 1 versus Pool 2 (PDPN Patients versus Non-PDPN Patients) 
Fewer PDPN patients (Pool 1) who received Qutenza for 30 minutes reported irritation or application site 
reactions compared to the non-PDPN patients; 68.3% of PDPN patients had no irritation compared with 
33.4% of non-PDPN patients. In addition, 4.1% of PDPN patients had a maximum increase of ≥ 2 points 
on day 1 compared with 34.1% of non-PDPN patients.

Cardiac Disorders and Adverse Events Associated with Blood Pressure Changes 
Cardiac Disorders 
No TEAEs in the “Cardiac disorders” System Organ Class with an onset within 7 days following treatment 
were reported in the PDPN population (Pool 1). In total, 7 patients (0.5%) in the Qutenza arms of the 
non-PDPN population had cardiac disorders (3 had palpitations, 2 had atrioventricular block first degree 
and 2 had tachycardia) within 7 days following treatment. 
Blood Pressure Changes 
In total, 7 (1.4%) Qutenza treated patients in the PDPN population had TEAEs associated with blood 
pressure changes with onset within 7 days following treatment (3 patients had blood pressure increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 49/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 4 patients had hypertension). All the patients who experienced TEAEs associated with blood pressure 
changes were from the PACE study and were, therefore, also receiving SOC medication. 
In the non-PDPN population 29 (1.9%) patients had TEAEs associated with blood pressure changes with 
onset within 7 days following treatment (17 had increased blood pressure, 9 had hypertension, 2 had 
tachycardia and systolic blood pressure increased and heart rate increased were each reported by 1 
patient). 
A similar proportion of patients experienced TEAEs associated with blood pressure changes occurring at 
any time during study (i.e., not just within 7 days of Qutenza patch application) in the PDPN population 
and non-PDPN population. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Associated with Neurological Function 
TEAEs associated with neurological function were analysed in the integrated safety analysis. Overall, 
more patients in the PDPN population experienced TEAEs associated with neurological function (11.8%) 
compared to the non-PDPN population (4.4%). The difference between the aetiologies was mainly due to 
the difference in the reports of burning sensation (11.2% versus 0.7%, respectively).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were 4 deaths in the PACE study (2 patients in the Qutenza arm and 2 patients in the SOC alone 
arm), none of which were considered related to study drug. No deaths were reported in the STEP study. 
During the overall clinical development program, 13 deaths were reported, none of which were 
considered related to study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
In the STEP and PACE studies, routine laboratory evaluations (haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis) 
were completed at screening and, if clinically indicated, later in the study. For both studies, clinical 
laboratory findings did not reveal any safety concerns. 
Neurological and Sensory Testing 
The neurological tests performed depended on the aetiology of the pain in the study. The PHN-targeted 
neurological/sensory examination consisted of light brush, pinprick, vibration, warmth and cold, while the 
HIV-AN and PDPN-targeted neurological/sensory examination consisted of deep tendon reflex, vibration, 
warm sensation, cold sensation and sharp (pinprick) sensation. The PACE study also included the Norfolk 
Quality of Life Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN) questionnaire as the primary safety variable and the Utah 
Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS) as a secondary safety variable. 
STEP Study 
Results of sensory testing based on dichotomous scoring in the STEP study over 12 weeks showed that a 
similar proportion of patients in both the Qutenza and placebo arms reported a reduction in sensitivity 
from screening to week 12. However, the majority of patients in both groups reported the same or 
increased sensitivity for all sensory modalities. 
Pool 1 versus Pool 2 (PDPN Patients versus Non-PDPN Patients) 
For all sensory modalities, as well as reflexes, the proportion of patients with the same scores 
post-treatment compared to baseline was greater for the 30-minute Qutenza treatment in the PDPN 
population (Pool 1) compared to the non-PDPN population. Conversely, the proportions of patients 
reporting either decreased or increased responses were higher in the non-PDPN population (Table 20).

Safety in special populations 
Special populations have not been specifically studied. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
N/A 
Post marketing experience 
As the current indication in Europe does not include diabetic patients, treatment of these patients is 
considered to be off-label. Therefore, too few patients with PDNP have been treated to estimate market 
exposure in this population. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of the diabetic population was analysed in comparison with other approved populations. Safety 
data were presented in 3 pools: Pool 1 (STEP+PACE studies - PDNP population), Pool 2 (all non-diabetic 
patients safety set from prior studies) and pool 3 (overall safety set). 
Overall, 2114 patients received Qutenza during the clinical development program. 1524 patients had pain 
of non-PDPN aetiology and 590 had pain due to PDPN (91 patients from study C111 and 499 patients from 
STEP and PACE).  
Most of the TEAEs reported in the Qutenza arms in STEP and PACE studies were attributable to application 
site reactions, and were consistent with the previously established safety profile. The most common 
adverse drug reactions were:  application site pain, burning sensation, pain in extremity, application site 
erythema and erythema.  
The incidence of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs and application site reactions were lower in the PDPN- 
compared to the non-PDPN pool.  The techniques of reporting of application site reactions were, however, 
different in PDPN and non-PDPN studies, which hampered the comparison between the pools. In studies 
submitted in the initial MAA, patients were actively asked if they had experienced an application site 
reaction (a separate CRF page was utilized), while in STEP and PACE this was not done. Additionally, in 
the STEP study the application site was covered throughout treatment and 24 h after removal of the patch 
to limit the probability of unblinding the study at an individual patient level.  
The reason for the differences in reporting between PDPN and non-PDPN studies was that the pattern of 
local reactions with Qutenza had been well characterized in the initial development program. It was 
determined that since multiple dermal and neurological assessments were included in STEP and PACE 
studies, spontaneous reporting of AEs would provide sufficient signal for any unique events. Therefore, 
standard methods of AE elucidation and reporting were used in STEP and PACE, in line with common 
practice in clinical studies. The protocols for both studies were submitted to EMA prior to starting the 
studies to confirm that the studies would meet regulatory expectations for the follow-up measures.  
Difference in respect of TEAE capture may have influenced the difference in application site reactions that 
are presented in these studies. Inter-study variation may also have been due to developmental stage of 
Qutenza.  AEs reported pre-approval could have been more numerous and diverse than those reported 
post-approval due to the familiarity of the Investigator with the drug. The MAH clarified that a standard 
method of reporting of adverse events was used to avoid bias of overreporting some dedicated adverse 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 53/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
events and underreporting some others. The CHMP was of the opinion that this approach can be 
acceptable, particularly since dermal assessment and monitoring was carried out very carefully and no 
new adverse events emerged and the safety profile in diabetic patients is comparable to the safety profile 
in the non-PDPN population.  
Burning sensation and pain in extremity were more commonly reported in the PDPN population (N= 55 
vs. 0 and N=36 vs. 2, respectively, in PDPN vs. non-PDPN pools). Both burning sensation and pain in 
extremity can be due to the underlying neuropathy. However, an imbalance observed between diabetic 
and non-diabetic population was most likely due to the different reporting of AEs in both pools.   
Most events of burning sensations and pain in extremity were related to application site reactions, were 
mild to moderate and resolved without long-term sequelae. The pattern of the appearance also confirmed 
that most reactions emerged shortly or immediately after patch application which suggest that these AEs 
were related to the study drug. The frequency categories of both burning sensation and pain in extremity 
were changed from uncommon to common in the SmPC.  
Patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy may have coexisting peripheral autonomic 
neuropathy with vasomotor and sudomotor dysfunction, which may lead to an increase in the 
vulnerability of the skin to breakdown. Application of capsaicin 8% in such areas may have a greater 
irritant effect, and result in cutaneous lesions at the treatment site. Therefore, an appropriate warning 
has been added to section 4.4 of the SmPC to instruct the physician to perform careful visual examination 
of the patients’ feet prior to every application of Qutenza.  
An increase in hypertension and burning pain was observed after 60-minute application in PACE study. 
This finding may have been due to the fact that those patients receiving the 60-minute application 
experienced more pain, which was associated with a temporary increase in blood pressure.  
The observed mean blood pressure changes, regardless of timing, were small in both painful diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) and non-PDPN studies. In PDPN patients the mean increases in systolic 
blood pressure at 15 minutes after patch removal were 2.0, 1.1 and 2.2 mm Hg for Qutenza 30 minutes, 
30 minutes + standard of care (SOC) and 60 minutes + SOC, respectively. This compares with 2.1 and 
6.0 mm Hg for Qutenza 30 minutes and 60 minutes, respectively, in non-PDPN patients at 5 minutes after 
patch removal. 
The diabetic population is considered to be at higher risk for cardiovascular events and the transient 
increase in blood pressure is a well-known effect of treatment with Qutenza.  Therefore, a warning that 
particular attention should be given to diabetic patients with significant comorbidities has been added to 
the SmPC.  
No significant decrease in sensory and neurological function was detected by the Norfolk questionnaire 
and UENS scale in the PACE trial. Both of these instruments were compliant with the CHMP guideline for 
peripheral neuropathy. A greater reduction (i.e., a lack of deterioration) was observed in Norfolk QOL-DN 
total scores (primary endpoint in PACE) in the Qutenza arms compared with the standard treatment, 
suggesting the absence of neuropathy-related functional deterioration and improved quality of life in the 
Qutenza arms. The reduction in total score was greater in the Qutenza-60 min arm compared to the 
Qutenza-30 min arm. Greater reduction was observed in all subscale scores in the Qutenza arms than in 
the SOC alone arm. However, mean values suggest that in activities of daily living, patients in the SOC 
alone arm experienced some worsening. 
An improvement in UENS total score was observed from baseline to the end of study in all treatment 
arms. There were no relevant differences in score between Qutenza arms compared to the standard 
treatment. The proportion of patients with the same scores in all sensory modalities and reflexes were 
greater for PDPN than in the non-PDPN population, while the proportion of patients reporting either 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 54/63 
 
 
 
 
decreased or increased responses was higher in the non-PDPN population. Despite being an open-label 
study, PACE results suggest that neurological-sensory functions were not compromised. 
The clinical safety data suggests no clear evidence for neurological impairment with multiple patch 
applications or dermal injuries which may have been associated with sensory loss. However, in the PACE 
study there was one case of hypoaesthesia which was considered possibly related to use of Qutenza and 
did not resolve 2 years after end of study. It was acknowledged that hypoaesthesia could have been 
caused by the worsening of the underlying disease but the role of study drug cannot be excluded. 
Post-marketing safety data did not show neurological impairment in the non-diabetic neuropathy 
indications to date, however, pharmacodynamic studies showed that in diabetic patients with 
neuropathy, recovery of epidermal nerve fibre density impaired by capsaicin treatment may be 
decreased. Tissue regeneration is known to be impaired in diabetic patients, particularly in those who 
suffer from a complicated disease. Persistent hypoaesthesia of the feet is therefore considered a 
particular risk for diabetic patients because of the risk of development of diabetic foot. Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC was updated to add this particular warning.  
Patients with retinopathy have generally more severely complicated diabetes with signs of 
microvasculopathy. Therefore, the CHMP requested data on local reactions and sensory changes in this 
subset of patients. 
The number of patients with retinopathy was low and the results should be interpreted with caution. In 
the STEP study, the proportion of patients with decreased sensitivity to below normal was higher in the 
retinopathy population, particularly for thermal stimuli and sharp sensations. However, these results 
cannot be attributed to capsaicin since this could be observed for both Qutenza and placebo arms,  
perhaps with minimally worse outcomes in the placebo group. The seemingly worse sensory outcomes 
could not be seen following multiple applications in the PACE study in which sample size of retinopathy 
subjects was considerably higher than in STEP.  
A similar pattern was observed for local reactions: in STEP a slightly higher incidence of local reactions 
were observed in retinopathy subjects but the sample size was low and these differences less consistent 
than in sensory assessment. Furthermore this was not confirmed in the PACE study.  Overall, the data do 
not suggest a worse safety profile of Qutenza in patients with diabetic retinopathy in terms of 
neurosensory functions and local reactions. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP concluded that the safety profile of Qutenza in diabetic patients was similar to the safety profile 
previously characterised in the broader neuropathic pain population. The most common AEs were local 
reactions of short duration.  
The SmPC has been updated to highlight the particular importance of cardiovascular risk, neurosensory 
loss and intactness of skin in diabetic patients. Events of interest will be closely reviewed and reported in 
the Periodic Safety Update Reports. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template and SmPC 
guideline, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis 
of the justification provided. The MAH considers that the main change in the patient leaflet is the wording 
of the indication. All other changes to the patient leaflet are considered minor and do not alter the key 
safety and efficacy messages. Therefore additional readability testing is considered unnecessary. The 
CHMP accepted this justification as valid.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the STEP study, Qutenza provided prolonged pain relief after a single patch application. The 30% 
responder rates for diabetic peripheral neuropathy showed 8% difference to placebo.The mean time to 
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 58/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
maximal analgesic effect was approximately 3 weeks and the effect was maintained over the subsequent 
9 weeks of the study.  
Sustained efficacy was seen with repeat applications in the long-term PACE study. A higher proportion of 
patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in pain (> 30% reduction from baseline) in Qutenza 
treated patients compared to those receiving SOC treatment (67.3% versus 40.6%). Approximately 
twice as many Qutenza patients achieved a 50% reduction in pain from baseline compared to those 
receiving SOC treatment (46.6% versus 23.8%, respectively). 
Treatment with Qutenza was associated with improvement in the general well-being of patients with 
PDPN, as observed by less interference with activities of daily living, less interference with sleep, and 
improved emotional well-being. Assessment of patient satisfaction with treatment was favourable for 
Qutenza and a positive effect on quality of life was observed compared to SOC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The difference between Qutenza and placebo was relatively small although comparable to other 
neuropathy studies. This is considered noteworthy considering that an inert placebo has been used in 
STEP in contrast to the low concentration capsaicin patch used as control in prior Qutenza studies. The 
use of inert placebo raised questions regarding the blinding of the STEP study, since the study subjects 
were aware of the irritative nature of Qutenza.  This concern was considered to be especially valid as the 
efficacy evaluation relied on self-assessment questionnaires.  
The efficacy was considered to be weak with regards to responder rates. The 30% responder rate in the 
STEP study was borderline significant (p= 0.049). The majority of secondary outcomes in the STEP study 
were not statistically significant.  
According to literature data, lower concentration capsaicin could be effective in the management of PDPN, 
however, the results of those studies are inconclusive. The lowest exposure to capsaicin, which can be 
effective, is not known. Based on the consideration that the most likely localisation of PDPN is on lower 
limbs, only foot applications were investigated. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequent AEs in diabetic patients were application site reactions, which is consistent with the 
safety profile observed in the non-diabetic population.  The most common AEs were: application site pain, 
burning sensation, pain in extremity, application site erythema and erythema.  
Patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy could have coexisting peripheral autonomic neuropathy with 
vasomotor and sudomotor dysfunction, which may lead to an increase in the vulnerability of the skin to 
breakdown. Application of Qutenza in such areas may have a greater irritant effect, and result in 
cutaneous lesions at the treatment site. 
Transient increase in blood pressure is a known risk associated with treatment-related pain. Diabetic 
patients with complicated disease may be at higher risk of cardiovascular events. Diabetes is also linked 
to the theoretical risk of a reduction or loss of neurosensory function following repeated Qutenza 
treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/545605/2015  
Page 59/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The comparison of application site reactions between PDPN and non-PDPN populations is hindered by the 
difference in AEs reporting technique between older and new studies.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
PDPN is characterized by pain, paraesthesia and sensory loss. Existing pharmacological treatments are 
limited and the pain is often challenging to treat. Efficacy of current neuropathic pain treatments is 
variable:  few patients experience complete pain relief, response may vary over time, and none of the 
treatments are without potential side effects.  
The efficacy of Qutenza was limited in the placebo-controlled trial. However, incremental effectiveness 
was demonstrated when Qutenza was added to a background of ‘standard of care’ treatment.  
The most common AEs are local reactions of short duration, which are particularly important in the 
diabetic population. However, the safety profile was not worse than in other neuropathy subjects studied 
in clinical trial settings.  
With regards to the specific risks in the PDPN population, specific guidance has been added to the SmPC 
and educational material. Firstly, it was recommended that the feet of diabetic patients should be visually 
examined prior to each treatment with Qutenza to detect skin lesions associated with underlying 
neuropathy and/or peripheral vascular disease. 
Furthermore, it was advised to clinically assess distal sensation in patients with pre-existing sensory 
impairment prior to each application of Qutenza therapy. Finally, the risk of cardiovascular events in 
diabetic patients has been addressed in the SmPC and educational material, with the advice to pay 
particular attention to those patients with comorbid coronary artery disease, hypertension and 
cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of Qutenza in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in diabetic patients is 
considered positive.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The demonstration of efficacy for Qutenza in PDPN has been considered in the context of the unmet 
medical need that characterizes this group of patients. Only approximately 50% of patients show a 30% 
reduction in pain from baseline levels and many patients require treatment with a combination of drugs 
from different classes such as tricyclic antidepressants, duloxetine or pregabalin. These drugs are all 
characterized by a substantial adverse events burden.  
Qutenza is a topical formulation with limited dermal penetration and minimal systemic absorption that 
provides an alternative to combination oral treatments.  Because a single treatment with Qutenza may be 
associated with sustained reductions in pain that persists for up to 3 months, the high-concentration 
capsaicin patch is considered to provide a valuable addition to existing pharmacological treatments for 
PDPN, which are typically administered 1 or more times each day.

The safety profile of Qutenza in PDPN including patients who have confirmed retinopathy was generally 
consistent with what was observed in the previously studied populations of PHN and HIV-AN submitted 
with the initial MAA.  The differences in the aetiology of these three neuropathies do not appear to 
translate into a clinically meaningful difference in response to treatment with Qutenza, thus supporting a 
broad neuropathic pain label.

important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
The MAH shall agree the details of an educational programme for health care practitioners with the 
National Competent Authorities and implement such programme nationally before launch.   
This educational programme will include: 
- 
- 
- 
recommendations regarding the general handling and disposal measures for Qutenza 
•  administration of capsaicin should only be done under medical supervision 
•  because of the risk of accidental exposure, the use of nitrile gloves, a mask and protective 
glasses are recommended 
•  administration of Qutenza in a well ventilated area to reduce the risk of occupational exposure 
instructions regarding the administration of Qutenza 
warnings and precautions, including the need: 
• 
to undertake a visual examination of the feet prior to each application of  Qutenza and at 
subsequent clinic visits to detect skin lesions related to underlying neuropathy and vascular 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
insufficiency in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
to be aware of the risk of reductions in sensory function which are generally minor and 
temporary (including to thermal and sharp stimuli) following administration of Qutenza 
to use caution when administering Qutenza in patients with reduced sensation in the feet and in 
those at increased risk for such changes in sensory function 
to clinically assess patients for increased sensory loss prior to each application of Qutenza in all 
patients with pre-existing sensory deficits. If sensory loss is detected or worsens, Qutenza 
treatment should be reconsidered 
to monitor blood pressure during the treatment procedure 
to provide supportive treatment if patients experience increased pain during Qutenza 
administration 
in patients with unstable or poorly controlled hypertension or cardiovascular disease: to 
evaluate, prior to initiating Qutenza treatment, the risk of adverse cardiovascular eventsdue to 
the potential stress of the procedure. Particular attention should be given to diabetic patients 
with comorbidities of coronary artery disease, hypertension and cardiovascular autonomic 
neuropathy 
in patients using high doses of opioids and with suspected high opioid tolerance: to put in place 
an alternative pain reduction strategy prior to initiating Qutenza treatment, as these patients 
may not respond to oral opioid analgesics when used for acute pain during and following the 
treatment procedure 
to warn patients about the risk of causal local reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis) and of  
irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes associated with the cleansing gel of Qutenza. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Scope 
Extension of Indication to include treatment of diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathic pain based 
on the results of studies E05-CL-3004 (STEP) and E05-CL-3002 (PACE) for Qutenza. As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet 
Annex II and Labelling are updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives for Belgium in the Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC, Annex II, labelling and Package Leaflet. 
An updated RMP (version 18.3) has been approved as part of the application.

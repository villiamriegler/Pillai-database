2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Nausea and vomiting are among the side effects associated with cancer treatment that patients and their 
families  often  fear  the  most.  If  nausea  and  vomiting  are  not  controlled  in  a  cancer  patient,  serious 
metabolic problems such as fluid and electrolyte balance disturbances and nutritional status deficiencies 
can  develop.  Psychological  problems  associated  with  nausea  and  vomiting  may  include  anxiety  and 
depression. In addition, uncontrolled nausea and vomiting may also lead to the decision by the physician 
to reduce chemotherapy dose intensity or to the wish by the patient to stop potentially beneficial cancer 
therapy. 
CINV is classified as acute, occurring within the first 24h after chemotherapy, or delayed, occurring after 
the first 24h. The development of acute emesis is known to largely depend on serotonin (5-HT). The 5-HT3 
receptor  has  been  demonstrated  to  selectively  participate  in  the  emetic  response,  thus  providing  a 
physiologic explanation for the demonstrated and clinically useful antiemetic effects of 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonists (RAs). 
The pathophysiology of delayed emesis is less understood, and multiple mechanisms may contribute, 
including substance P. Substance P belongs to the neurokinin (NK) family of neuropeptides and exerts its 
biological effects via interaction with the NK1 receptor.  
Presently,  a  four-level  classification  of  intravenous  chemotherapy  agents,  based  on  incidence  of 
emetogenicity (high >90%, moderate 30%-90%, low 10%-30% and minimal <10%) has been accepted 
by the major organizations producing recommendations on antiemetics, who recommend that patients 
receiving HEC regimens or MEC regimens with anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide should be 
treated with a combination of a 5-HT3 RA, NK1 RA and a systemic corticosteroid. 
About the product 
The  proposed  palonosetron-netupitant  fixed  combination  (Combination  or  FDC)  is  composed  of 
palonosetron - (ALOXI) - a registered 5-HT3 RA, and the new molecular entity, NK1 RA netupitant. It is a 
hard gelatin capsule for oral route.  
Palonosetron is a well-known potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with demonstrated efficacy 
by the intravenous (I.V.) and oral route for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer 
therapy.  
Palonosetron 250 mcg solution for injection (ALOXI EU/1/04/306/001) was approved via the Centralised 
Procedure on March 22, 2005 and is indicated in adults for:  
• 
• 
the  prevention  of  acute  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy,  
the  prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy.  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 10/153 
 
  
  
  
 
Palonosetron 500 mcg oral capsules (ALOXI EU/1/04/306/002-003) were approved as a line extension 
application on May 5, 2010 and are indicated in adults for:  
• 
the  prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy.  
Netupitant is a novel, potent and selective NK1 receptor antagonist. It has been shown to be a highly 
effective  antiemetic  in  a  variety  of  pre-clinical  models.  In  human  volunteers,  the  antiemetic  effect  of 
netupitant was assessed using an apomorphine challenge model. Overall, netupitant appeared to reduce 
the  incidence  of  emetic  episodes  following  the  apomorphine  challenge  in  a  concentration-dependent 
manner, with the incidence of vomiting decreasing as netupitant plasma concentration increased.  
The characteristics of the two active pharmaceutical ingredients supported the development as a fixed 
combination, since their mechanism of action is exerted on different neuropathways (5-HT3 receptors and 
NK1  receptors)  and  both  drugs  show  an  extended  half-life  (approximately  40  and  90  hours  for 
palonosetron and netupitant, respectively). 
The  main  advantages  of  the  netupitant-palonosetron  fixed-dose  combination  product  are  to  improve 
patient  compliance  due  to  a  simplification  and  convenience  of  therapy  and  to  increase  adherence  to 
guidelines for administration of both a 5-HT3 and NK1 RA.  
The claimed and approved indication is: 
Akynzeo is indicated in adults for the: 
Prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cisplatin-based 
cancer chemotherapy. 
Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (MAA)  for  the  combination  capsule  netupitant  300  mg  - 
palonosetron  0.50  mg,  for  the  prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with 
cancer chemotherapy in adult patients is a full application in accordance with directive 2001/83/EC as 
amended and regulation 726/2004. 
The development program of the product to support its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) was 
agreed with CHMP during a Scientific Advice Procedure, where clinical aspects were presented together 
with quality, multi-disciplinarily, and non-clinical items.  
With regard to clinical efficacy and safety, the CHMP agreed that the proposed netupitant/palonosetron 
combination  is  based  on  valid  therapeutic  principles,  in  accordance  with  guidance  on  fixed-dose 
combination (CPMP/EWP/240/95) and that the proposed safety and efficacy program, if successful, is 
suitable to support the registration of the combination in the HEC and MEC target therapeutic indication.  
HEC Study NETU-07-07: the CHMP agreed that the study has the potential for consideration as the sole 
pivotal efficacy trial to support the HEC indication, considering the robustness of results, and provided 
that the similar study conducted in MEC induced CINV (NETU-08-18) is similarly positive, since the HEC 
and  MEC  diseases  are  closely  related.  The  NETU-07-07  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  analysis  were 
considered adequate to demonstrate efficacy to support the proposed target indication in HEC.  
MEC  Study  NETU-08-18:  the  CHMP  judged  the  proposed  superiority  design  acceptable  to  provide 
evidence of efficacy and therefore to support the proposed target indication in MEC. The choice of the 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 11/153 
 
  
  
  
primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. proportion of patients with Complete Response in the delayed phase at 
cycle 1) and key secondary efficacy endpoints (i.e. proportion of patients with Complete Response in the 
acute  and  overall  phases  at  cycle  1),  including  the  proposed  approach  to  address  multiplicity  for  the 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in the study NETU-08-18 were considered acceptable. The 
adoption of a 5% type I error (2-sided) was accepted for this single MEC pivotal study since the results of 
the  HEC  trial  NETU-07-07  were  strongly  supportive.  The  definition  of  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  was 
considered adequate for the primary efficacy analysis in Cycle 1. For the primary efficacy analysis of the 
multiple  cycle  extension  (MCE)  the  Party  recommended  to  include  all  patients  from  the  Cycle  1  full 
analysis set in the MCE full analysis set, because the proposed MCE FAS is not appropriate as patients 
were  not  re-randomised  at  the  time  of  entering  the  MCE.  The  proposed  primary  efficacy  analysis  in 
NETU-08-18 was considered acceptable to demonstrate efficacy and the proposed patient population in 
NETU-08-18 adequate to support the proposed target label.  
Safety HEC and MEC Study NETU-10-29: the comparator, the sample size assumption and the population 
(in term of represented chemotherapy regimens) were considered adequate to characterize the safety 
profile of the Combination in chemotherapy repeated cycles.  
HEC Study PALO-10-01: As a general perspective, the CHMP considered the study probably not necessary 
to provide evidence of efficacy of palonosetron 0.50 mg oral capsules in the HEC setting, since the efficacy 
of oral palonosetron monotherapy in HEC can be inferred both from its proven efficacy in MEC and from 
the results of study NETU-07-07, where the monotherapy arm performed far better than a non-active 
treatment  could  possibly  achieve.  The  CHMP  considered  the  design  of  the  study  reasonable  and  the 
primary endpoint (proportion of patients with CR in the acute phase) acceptable. The 15% non-inferiority 
margin was deemed sufficiently narrow given the poor expected efficacy of placebo. The choice to set the 
type I error at 1% was judged even more stringent than requested; the definitions and proposed roles for 
populations  of  analyses  in  PALO-10-01,  were  considered  appropriate.  The  proposed  primary  efficacy 
analysis in PALO-10-01 was considered acceptable to demonstrate efficacy. Finally the proposed patient 
population  in  study  PALO-10-01  was  adequate  to  support  the  proposed  target  label,  in  view  of  the 
proposed role of PALO-10-01 in the development program of the Combination.  
In  relationship  to  the  overall  characterization  of  the  safety  profile  of  the  Combination  in  the  global 
registration  program,  the  Party  considered  it  adequate  in  term  of  number  of  individuals  and  type  of 
patient population and agreed on the adequateness of safety measures proposed in both clinical studies 
NETU-08-18 and NETU-10-29. Based on the long half-lives of both compounds, it was recommended to 
add additional investigations approximately 10 days after dosing. 
Finally, the CHMP agreed on the adequateness of the global PK evaluation, including Population PK/PD 
Assessment, without performing a full PK study in cancer patients. 
A full waiver for a Paediatric Investigation Plan for the Combination was obtained based on the lack of 
significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for all subsets of the paediatric population (0 to 18 
years of age) in the condition of prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (EMA decision 
P/0014/ 2012 dated January 24, 2012).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Netupitant 
General information 
The  information  on  netupitant  is  provided  according  to  the  Active  Substance  Master  File  (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The chemical name of netupitant is 
2-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-N,2-dimethyl-N-[4-(2-methylphenyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyri
dine-3-yl]propanamide and has the following structure and properties: 
Molecular formula: C30H32F6N4O   -   Relative molecular mass: 578.61 gmol-1 
The structure of netupitant was inferred from its route of synthesis and confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRPD. 
Netupitant is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is very slightly soluble in water 
and  freely  soluble  in  a  range  of  organic  solvents  such  as  acetone,  toluene,  and  methanol.  The  active 
substance is milled to reduce particle size. Three physical forms are known, including unstable amorphous 
and solvated forms. The chosen commercial form is the most thermodynamically stable and is stable to 
the particle size reduction process. Netupitant is achiral. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Netupitant  is  synthesized  convergently  in  nine  main  steps  using  commercially  available,  well-defined 
starting  materials  with  acceptable  specifications.  Five  manufacturers  are  listed  in  the  dossier  with

responsibility  for  different  steps  in  the  netupitant  manufacturing  process,  An  additional  two 
manufacturers are responsible for the subsequent micronization of the active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. Genotoxic impurities can potentially form at several steps of the process. 
The applicant provided impurity spike and purge data to demonstrate that these are removed by the 
process and not present in the isolated active substance. In addition the applicant will test the first three 
batches of netupitant synthesized from intermediates sourced from each intermediate manufacturer for 
genotoxins,  using  the  relevant  analytical  methods,  to  provide  further  assurance  of  active  substance 
safety. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (IR, HPLC), 
assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content  (KF),  heavy  metals  (USP), 
sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). In addition, a test for genotoxic 
impurities (HPLC and GC-MS) is included in the specification to be carried out on the first three batches of 
netupitant synthesized from intermediates from each source. 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Analysis data on seven production scale batches of the active substance, using starting materials from all 
proposed  suppliers,  and  milled  at  both  proposed  micronisations  sites,  were  provided.  The  results  are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on seven production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC 
/  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  following  parameters  were  tested: 
appearance, water content, related substances and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating. No significant changes were observed for any of the parameters 
tested. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. A reduction in assay 
indicates that netupitant is photosensitive but it is stored away from light and so this is not of concern. 
Forced degradation studies were also carried out by exposing netupitant solutions to heat, light, acid (pH 
1), base (pH 11) and hydrogen peroxide. Solid netupitant was also exposed to heat. The active substance 
is  not  sensitive  to  heat,  or  the  extremes  of  pH  tested.  It  is  however  susceptible  to  oxidation  and 
photo-degradation.

The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
Palonosetron Hydrochloride 
General information 
The information on palonosetron hydrochloride is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
The chemical name of palonosetron hydrochloride is 
(3aS)-2-[(S)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline 
hydrochloride and it has the following structure and properties: 
Molecular formula: C19H24N2O.HCl   -   Relative molecular mass: 332.87 gmol-1 
The structure of palonosetron hydrochloride was inferred from its route of synthesis and confirmed by 1H 
and  13C  NMR  spectroscopy,  IR  spectroscopy,  mass  spectrometry,  elemental  analysis.  The  absolute 
configuration was determined by XRPD. 
Palonosetron  hydrochloride  is  a  white  to  off-white,  non-hygroscopic,  crystalline  powder.  It  is  freely 
soluble  in  water,  slightly  soluble  in  polar  organic  solvents,  and  practically  insoluble  in  apolar  organic 
solvents. 
Palonosetron  contains  2  stereocentres  and  is  synthesized  as  the  (S,S)-isomer.  Enantiomeric  purity  is 
controlled in the specification of the starting material which contains a single chiral centre, and by specific 
optical rotation in the active substance. The enantiomeric and diastereomeric impurities are controlled in 
the active substance specification. Polymorphism has been observed for palonosetron hydrochloride but 
since  it  is  in  solution  within  the  soft  capsule  formulation,  its  physical  properties  do  not  impact 
bioavailability and neither particle size nor polymorphic form is controlled. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Palonosetron  hydrochloride  is  synthesized  by  the  ASMF  holder  in  three  main  steps  using  well-defined 
starting  materials  with  acceptable  specifications.  Palonosetron  hydrochloride  purity  is  enhanced  by 
recrystallization. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (IR, UV), 
assay (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual inspection), pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), 
loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP), impurities (HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), chloride content (AgNO 3 titration), residual  solvents (GC), bioburden  (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. The analytical methods 
used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately  validated  in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Analysis data for ten commercial scale batches of palonosetron hydrochloride are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  palonosetron  hydrochloride  from  the  proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 60 months under long term conditions (25 
ºC / 60% RH), for 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 60% RH), and for 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Since the active 
substance is well-known and has been on the market (as Aloxi) since 2003, the intermediate conditions 
pre-date  ICH  Q1A  and  are  thus  slightly  different  from  the  current  guideline  conditions.  The  following 
parameters  were  tested:  appearance;  assay;  impurities;  loss  on  drying;  bioburden.  The  analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. There were no significant trends 
or changes to any measured parameter under any of the conditions.   
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  on  1  batch  demonstrates  that  palonosetron 
hydrochloride is not photosensitive. 
Stability data generated under stressed conditions (in aqueous solution at acidic and basic pH, at high 
temperature, on irradiation with light, and in the presence of H2O2) indicate that the main degradation 
pathway is oxidation. Solid state studies show deliquescence and degradation at high temperatures and 
humidities. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  aim  of  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  produce  a  dosage  form  containing  fixed  amounts  of 
netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride. Palonosetron is already authorised in the marketed product 
Aloxi, which is available both as a solution for injection and as soft capsules. Netupitant is a new active 
substance. Initial studies were focused on the compatibility of the two active substances and attempts to 
find  a  common  formulation.  No  degradation  was  observed  when  netupitant  and  palonosteron  were 
combined under a variety of conditions. However, the large difference in dose size (300 vs 0.5 mg) and 
differences  in  physicochemical  properties,  made  co-formulation  difficult.  A  solid  form  formulation  of 
Palonosetron  was  tested  and  displayed  reduced  potency,  and  dry  mixtures  containing  both  active 
substances  had  poor  content  uniformity.  By  contrast,  the  relatively  large  dose  of  netupitant  was 
insufficiently soluble in suitable liquid vehicles for softgel capsule filling. Thus, the decision was made to 
combine palonosetron softgel capsules with netupitant tablets inside a hard capsule. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 16/153 
 
  
  
  
Netupitant  exhibits  low  aqueous  solubility  but  high  permeability  (BCS  class  II).  In  order  to  ensure  a 
consistent  dissolution  profile,  it  is  micronized  to  reduce  particle  size.  All  excipients  are  well-known 
pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur.  standards  or  in-house 
specifications for non-compendial excipients. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation.  The  tablets  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the  commercial  formulation  are  round,  flat  and 
off-white. The critical quality attributes identified were appearance, identity, assay, purity, uniformity of 
dosage units, water content and dissolution. 
A series of bioequivalence studies enabled bridging between the various netupitant formulations used 
clinically. The choice of dissolution method was adequately justified and its discriminatory power has been 
demonstrated.  
Palonosetron is highly soluble and highly permeable (BCS class I). Its physicochemical properties are not 
important for formulation purposes as it is in solution within the softgel capsules. The development of the 
softgels for Akynzeo was based on the composition of Aloxi. In order to reduce the softgel capsule size to 
enable it to fit within the larger hard capsule, the amount of glycerol monocaprylcaproate solvent was 
halved. Other excipients were held at the same levels as in Aloxi, and comprise butylated hydroxyanisole 
to prevent oxidative degradation as well as glycerine and water to prevent capsule hardening over time. 
The solubility and stability of palonosetron hydrochloride in the fill solution was demonstrated. The critical 
quality  attributes  identified  were  appearance,  identity,  assay,  purity,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  and 
dissolution. Most excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with 
Ph.  Eur.  standards.  Non-pharmaceutical  excipients  are  also  used  in  the  capsule  shell  but  these  are 
mixtures of well-known or pharmacopoeial excipients. 
The final image of Akynzeo is white size 0 capsules with a caramel-coloured cap imprinted in black ink on 
the white part. Each capsule contains three netupitant tablets and one palonosetron softgel capsule. The 
full list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The dissolution methods for the combined 
capsules are considered discriminatory. A switch was made late in the development programme from the 
white capsules with blue caps used in phase III clinical studies as the colour faded over time. Other than 
colour, there is no difference between the compositions of the two capsule types. 
The primary packaging is alu/alu blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  of  intermediate  netupitant  tablets  consists  of  five  main  steps:  mixing  of 
netupitant  with  intra-granular  excipients  followed  by  high  shear  wet  granulation;  drying  and  milling; 
blending with extra-granular excipients; compression to form tablets; bulk packaging. This is considered 
to  be  a  standard  manufacturing  process  and  validation  will  be  performed  before  commercialisation. 
Acceptance  limits  have  been  defined  for  critical  process  parameters  in  the  granulation,  drying,  and 
compression steps in order to meet the intended quality. 
The manufacturing process of intermediate palonosetron softgel capsules consists of four main steps: 
dissolution  of  palonosetron  and  excipients  in  the  fill  solution;  encapsulation  into  softgel  capsules  and 
lubrication; drying and washing; bulk packaging. Given the company’s experience of manufacturing Aloxi 
softgel capsules using a similar method, this is considered to be a standard manufacturing process, and 
so  validation  will  be  carried  out  prior  to  commercialisation.  In-process  controls  for  the  critical 
encapsulation step have been defined and are well justified. 
For  the  production  of  Akynzeo  hard  capsules,  three  netupitant  tablets  and  one  palonosetron  softgel 
capsule are filled into the size 0 hard capsules. Controls are in place to ensure the correct filling of each 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 17/153 
 
  
  
  
capsule. Once sealed, the capsules are put into the primary packaging. Validation of this standard process 
will be performed prior to commercialisation. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
comprise  tests  for  appearance  of  capsules  (visual  inspection),  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC), 
impurities  (HPLC),  BHA  content  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  enumeration  (Ph.  Eur.). 
Given the final dosage form comprises netupitant tablets and palonosetron softgels combined in a hard 
capsule, certain parameters are tested in the intermediate standalone dosage forms as follows:  
Netupitant tablets: appearance (visual inspection), identity (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Eur.), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and loss on drying (Ph. Eur.). 
Palonosetron  softgels:  appearance  and  aspect  of  content  (visual  inspection),  identity  (HPLC,  UV), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  BHA 
content (HPLC), and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The applicant committed to re-evaluate the dissolution specification as a review of the consistency of 
manufacturing and in vitro performance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Analysis results are provided for five batches of combination capsules. Additional data on three 
commercial batches of a previous product format with different coloured capsules, and six batches used 
in clinical trials made by different manufacturers, including the commercial one, were provided as 
additional information and support the above conclusions. 
Analysis results are  also provided for intermediate netupitant tablets, (nine commercial scale batches 
from  the  commercial  manufacturer  and  four  from  a  previous  manufacturer),  and  for  intermediate 
palonosetron softgel capsules (eight commercial scale batches). 
The  combined  provided  data  confirms  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of the blue/white capsules and three commercial scale 
batches of the caramel/white capsules stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH), and for up to 6 months 
under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The 
finished  product  was  stored  in  the  proposed  commercial  container  closure  system  and  manufactured 
using  the  proposed  manufacturing  process  by  the  proposed  manufacturer.  Samples  were  tested  for 
appearance, aspect of the palonosetron softgels, assay (both active substances), impurities (from both 
active substances), BHA content, dissolution (both active substances) and microbial enumeration. The 
analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  There  were  no  significant  changes  to  any  of  the 
measured parameters under any condition, other than the fading of the blue  colour in the blue/white 
capsules. Some capsules from later time-points under all conditions required S2 and S3 testing to meet 
specification for dissolution, an observation attributed to hardening of the hard gelatin capsules over time 
and which is not considered an issue. 
In addition, one batch of caramel/white capsules was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products indicating that Akynzeo is not affected by 
exposure to light. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 18/153 
 
  
  
  
Bulk holding times were investigated on one batch of blue/white capsules for up to 24 months and one 
batch of caramel/white capsules for up to 9 months. A bulk holding time of up to 24 months is acceptable, 
starting from the date of manufacture of whichever intermediate product is produced first. 
Bulk  stability  study  results  for  one  batch  each  of  intermediate  netupitant  tablets  and  palonosetron 
softgels were also provided. The results support bulk holding times of up to 12 months for netupitant 
tablets and up to 24 months for palonosetron softgels. In line with the CHMP/CVMP QWP Q&A document 
on “stability issues of pharmaceutical bulk products for use in manufacture of the finished product,” the 
applicant  will  made  a  commitment  (located  in  the  post-authorisation  stability  section  for  each 
intermediate  product)  to  carry  out  bulk  stability  studies  on  an  additional  batch  of  each  intermediate 
following a request from CHMP. 
The  applicant  will  continue  the  stability  studies  of  the  caramel/white  capsules  up  to  the  end  of  the 
proposed shelf life, and bulk holding time. In addition, the first three commercial batches of Akynzeo will 
be placed on long term stability studies. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture are provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
The  applicant  should  review  the  finished  product  dissolution  specification  once  sufficient 
manufacturing experience has been gained, and tighten if appropriate. 
The  applicant  should  carry  out  a  bulk  stability  study  on  an  additional  batch  of  intermediate 
netupitant  tablets  and  complete  the  ongoing  stability  study  on  the  additional  batch  of 
intermediate palonosetron softgels, in line with the CHMP/CVMP QWP Q&A document on “stability 
issues of pharmaceutical bulk products for use in manufacture of the finished product.”

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  part  of  this  Marketing  Authorization  Application  is  consistent  with  the  EU  Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005 “Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Dose Combination 
Medicinal Products”. 
Thus, this submission includes studies of orally administered netupitant and intravenously administered 
netupitant that investigated the pharmacology, toxicokinetics and ADME, safety pharmacology, general 
toxicology and genetic toxicity (in vivo and in vitro). Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies 
were conducted in rats and/or rabbits to assess effects on fertility, embryofetal development, and pre- 
and post-natal development. The toxicologic aspect of the combination of netupitant and palonosetron 
was  evaluated  by  pharmacology,  safety  pharmacology  and  repeat  dose  studies.  Full  non  clinical 
investigation on Palonostrone has been carried out for the authorisation of Aloxi (palonosetron). 
The pivotal pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies were performed in accordance with GLP as claimed by 
the applicant.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Netupitant is a high affinity hNK1 receptor antagonist (comparable to substance P and the selective NK1 
receptor antagonist MK869) with a 1000-fold greater selectivity for hNK2 and a 34 fold greater selectivity 
for hNK3.  While netupitant at 10 µM indicated approximately 3 orders of magnitude separation between 
affinity for the NK1 compared to over 50 other receptors and ion channels, interactions at the histamine 
(H2), adenosine (A3), DA and 5-HT reuptake sites, L-type Ca2+ channel and diltiazem binding site on the 
Ca2+ channel were observed.  
Additional  binding  studies  (Reports  NETU-10-24,  NETU-10-16  and  NETU-12-13)  were  performed  with 
netupitant and its metabolites (M1, M2, M3 and M4).  These studies demonstrate that netupitant and all 
its metabolites have a high affinity for NK1.  Furthermore netupitant and M4 show 10,000 fold selectivity 
over NK2 and NK3 receptors.  Binding of M1, M2, and M3 to NK2 and NK3 have not been performed.  
However,  based  on  the  inhibition  of  foot-tapping  in  gerbils,  netupitant  and  M3  showed  comparable 
potency,  whereas  M1  and  M3  were  less  potent.  Therefore,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  M1  and  M3 
contribute to the pharmacological activity of netupitant. In further binding studies, the netupitant main 
metabolites, M1 was shown to interact at the L-type Ca2+ channel (IC50 = 2.8 μM; Ki = 1.4 μM). 
In  clinical  studies,  an  additional  metabolite  M4  (N-oxide,  N-demethyl  derivative)  was  detected.    This 
metabolite showed activity on hNK1 receptor (IC50 = 3.7 nM; Ki = 1.6 nM) and on hNK3 (IC50 was 8 μM 
and the Ki =8 μM).   
Intracerebroventricular injection of the NK1 agonist GR73632 produces a foot tapping response in gerbils 
which is inhibited by brain-penetrating antagonists of the NK1 receptor. This in vivo assay was employed 
to  examine  dose  and  time  dependent  effects  of  netupitant  on  foot  tapping  responses  in  gerbils.  
Netupitant blocked the foot-tapping response elicited by the central injection of GR73632 with an ED50 of 
approximately 0.5mg/kg p.o. and 1.5 mg/kg i.p. The plasma levels of netupitant necessary to achieve a 
robust inhibition (75%) of this effect were approximately 40ng/ml. The half-life of activity for netupitant 
was  48h  in  this  test.    A  60  minute  pre-treatment  time  with  netupitant  (3  mg/kg)  was  required  for 
complete  blockade  of  foot-tapping.    Moreover,  the  three  main  metabolites  M1,  M2  and  M3  were  also 
examined for activity in the gerbil foot-tapping test.  These data concluded that M1 and Me are active 
following IP administration and M1 is active following oral administration.  The PK for the M1 and M3 were 
not measured but given the affinity of these metabolites to the respective receptors it can be assume they 
are present. 
Netupitant demonstrated antiemetic action in ferrets against various acute-induced and delayed models 
of emesis.  The ED50 for oral netupitant for the prevention of emesis induced by ap cisplatin in ferrets was 
approximately 0.2 mg/kg. Netupitant administered orally as a single dose (3 mg/kg) was also found to 
completely block the acute (<24h) phase of emesis produced by cisplatin and block up to 90-95% of 
delayed (24-72 h) phase of emesis produced by cisplatin.  Plasma levels showed that both the parent 
compound and M1 metabolite were detectable up to 96 hours and were functional at points up to 72 hours 
(90-95% inhibition of cisplatin-induced emesis).  
Palonosetron is a highly specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and has significantly stronger receptor binding 
than some other such drugs, e.g. ondansetron, granisetron. The drug is highly effective in preventing 
antineoplastic-induced  emesis  in  dogs  and  ferrets.  It  has  no  clinically  significant  action  on  other 
serotonergic receptors. M4 and M9 exhibited at least 100-fold less antagonistic activity than palonosetron 
and their activity is not considered clinically relevant.  
Palonosetron (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) and netupitant (1 mg/kg, p.o.), alone or in combination together with 
dexamethasone  were  able  to  prevent  emesis  induced  by  cisplatin  up  to  72  hrs.    The  combination  of 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 22/153 
 
  
  
  
 
netupitant and palonosetron was thought to offer a greater therapeutic advantage versus the treatments 
alone in that the antiemetic action was 100% maintained for the entire 72 hr duration.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmadynamics studies have been submitted for netupitant or netupitant / palonosetron; 
for alonosetron when tested against substance P-induced contractions in the isolated guinea pig ileum 
palonosetron  caused  a  slight  decrease  in  response.  This  less  than  2-fold  change  was  found  at 
concentrations 1000-fold higher than required to block the 5HT3 receptor in this system.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In a non-GLP Irwin study performed in rats, netupitant up 1000 mg/kg had no effects on gait, reflexes or 
other neurological signs.  Furthermore, netupitant (3, 30, and 100 mg/kg p.o.) showed no signs of anti- 
or pro-convulsant activity in rats following an infusion with pentylenetetrazol. 
In vitro, netupitant and it’s metabolites (M1, M2 and M3) blocked hERG K+ channels with IC50 of 0.76, 
0.84, 43 and 4.4 µM, respectively.  In isolated canine ventricular mycoytes, netupitant and its metabolite 
M1  induced  a  very  slight  inhibition  (21  ±  %  and  25  ±  2%,  respectively)  of  IKr  tail  current  whereas 
metabolite M3 induced 14 ± 2% and 57 ± 8% inhibition of IKr tail current at 3 and 30 μM, respectively.  
Netupitant was only tested to 3 μM owing to issues with solubility, m2 showed no effect up to 30 μM.  In 
isolated canine Purkinje fibres, significant decreases in action potentials were seen with neupitant and its 
metabolites at concentrations >3 μM.  In isolated canine papillary muscle, only the M3 metabolite was 
shown to induce significant increase in action potential duration at APD50, APD70 APD90. 
The  safety  pharmacology  of  palonosetron  including  central  nervous  system,  respiratory  system, 
autonomic  nervous  system,  gastrointestinal  system,  renal/urinary  system,  blood  compatibility  and 
hemodynamic  and  respiratory  effects  have  been  studied.  Moreover,  extensive  investigation  of 
cardiovascular safety was performed. In vitro studies confirmed the expected effects of palonosetron, at 
high concentrations. In vivo studies using several species showed effects on cardiac conduction, but no 
Torsades de Pointes were observed, despite the use of doses up to 1 mg/kg (which is 300-fold higher than 
the proposed human dose). 
In vivo the combination of palonoestron and netupitant induced a slight prolongation of action potential 
duration  in  an  in  vivo  guinea  pig  study  and  in  an  in  vivo  canine  model  produced  decrease  in 
atrio-ventricular  conduction  and  ventricular  depolarization  rate  associated  with  a  prolongation  of 
ventricular repolarization. Cardiovascular effects were observed in conscious dogs with netupitant and its 
main metabolite M1 only after repeated administration (14-day) at the highest dosages (netupitant 50 
mg/kg and M1 30 mg/kg).  These studies suggest that M1 is more likely to be associated with the onset 
of QT prolongation than netupitant – M1 exposure was also higher in the heart and with heart/plasma 
concentration ratio compared to netupitant (See PK section).  Moreover exposure to M1 is quantitatively 
higher in the dog compared to human.   
Netupitant had no significant effect on respiratory, renal or gastrointestinal systems at doses up to 50 
mg/kg (respiratory) and 100 mg/kg (renal and gastrointestinal).  Palonosetron is an approved drug with 
a known preclinical and clinical safety profile.  While, no safety pharmacology studies investigating the 
respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems have reported with the netupitant/palonosetron 
combination, no significant effects on on GI, respiratory and CNS were reported in the 13-week rat and 
dog studies.  
No  abuse  liability/dependence  potential  or  withdrawal  behaviours  were  observed  with  Netu/Palo 
combination at doses similar to or higher then the proposed therapeutic dose in humans (i.e. 300/0.50 
mg Netu/Palo p.o.).

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non clinical PD drug interactions studies have submitted for netupitant, palonosetron, netupitant / 
palonosetron combinaison. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of netupitant and its major metabolites was determined following single and repeat 
doses in rats and dogs. Distribution was investigated by whole body autoradiography following oral and 
intravenous doses of [14C]-netupitant, and plasma protein binding was investigated in human, rat, dog 
and  gerbil  in  vitro.  Metabolite  profiles  were  determined  in  rat  and  dog.  Absorption  was  determined 
following oral and intraperitoneal administration of netupitant in rats and oral administration in dogs and 
cynomolgous monkeys. Absorption following oral administration was moderate with Tmax of about 3.5 
hours  in  rats  and  2-5  hours  in  dogs  depending  on  the  salt  used.  In  rats  following  IV  administration 
netupitant had low to moderate clearance and a long apparent terminal half life. Volume of distribution 
was high in all species. Oral bioavailability in each species varied substantially between animals, with 
42-105%, 34-83% and 37-62% in rats, dogs, and monkeys. The large variation is most likely due to the 
low numbers of animals used in the studies.  
Netupitant was highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins in all species. The mean percentage of free drug 
was 0.33% in man, 0.22% in dog, 0.31% in rat, 0.50% in gerbil and < 1% in mouse. The in vitro plasma 
protein binding of the three major metabolites of netupitant, M1, M2 and M3 was also determined in man, 
dog (Swiss beagle) and rat. The plasma protein binding over 99% for M1 metabolite, and high for M2 
metabolite were (2.3% (man), 2.2% (dog) and 0.65% (rat) free drug). For M3, plasma protein binding 
was  99%  in  rat  and  human  and  97.5%  in  dog.  In  vivo  distribution  was  determined  by  whole  body 
autoradiography  in  rats.  Following  oral  doses  of  10  mg/kg  netupitant,  distribution  was  extensive. 
Radioactivity  was  seen  highest  (>20  fold  plasma  exposure)  in  the  harderian  gland,  followed  by  lung, 
adrenal,  spleen,  pituitary,  exorbital  and  intraorbital  lachrymal  glands  and  thyroid.  Netupitant  related 
material  crossed  the  blood  brain  barrier,  but  was  not  detectable  by  216  hours  post-dose.  The  M1 
metabolite  was  the  predominant  drug-related  material  by  24  hours,  so  distribution  behaviour  was 
considered to be due largely to M1. Repeated administration indicated accumulation in nasal mucosa, 
mandibular lymph nodes, epididymis and choroid plexus. Administration to pigmented rats showed 5-8 
times  greater  levels  in  the  uveal  tract  than  in  unpigmented  animals.  Binding  was  reversible,  and 
netupitant was not phototoxic in vitro. Netupitant and its three major metabolites were shown to cross the 
blood brain barrier in a specific study in rats. In dogs, netupitant, M1 and M3 were measurable in the 
heart. At the end of the two 4 weeks toxicology studies and the telemetry study in dog M1 was on average 
approximately 5-fold more concentrated than netupitant in heart tissue. 
In  human,  rat,  dog,  minipig  and  marmoset  liver  microsomal  incubations,  two  major  metabolites,  an 
N-demethylation product (M1) and an N-oxidation product (M2), in addition to hydroxylation products 
(M3), were identified in all species. CYP3A4 was found to be responsible for the oxidation of netupitant to 
the same metabolites observed also in the incubations with human liver microsomes. In rats and dogs in 
vivo, the three major metabolites were all identified.  Metabolism was extensive, with the metabolites 
generally reaching greater concentrations than parent drug by 24 hours. M1 and M2 exposure was similar 
in rat to humans, but higher in dogs, however M3 was lower in both species than in humans. In both rat 
and  dog,  excretion  was  predominantly  by  the  faecal  route,  with  over  85%  of  the  administered  dose 
recovered  in  faeces.  Less  that  0.5%  and  2%  of  dose  was  recovered  in  the  urine  in  rats  and  dogs 
respectively. In dogs administered netupitant intravenously, recovery was largely in faeces, indicative of 
biliary excretion. In rat and dogs, elimination was very slow. In rats excretion was not complete after 1 
week following oral or IV dosing, with 6% of the oral dose remaining in the carcass. In dogs, 87.8% and 
88.1% of the dose was recovered following oral and IV dosing at two weeks post-dose, and radioactivity 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 24/153 
 
  
  
  
was detectable 1008 hours after the dose. The data indicate that drug related material is eliminated very 
slowly and persist in the species tested for considerable time following administration. 
For Palonosetron, Protein binding was approximately 48 % in rat and 66 % in dog plasma. The moderate 
extent of plasma protein binding suggests that small changes would have no influence on palonosetron 
availability. 
Palonosetron  was  extensively  distributed,  including  to  the  brain.  It  did  not  accumulate  and  is  rapidly 
cleared. No metabolites were measured in the brain, suggesting that they did not pass the blood-brain 
barrier or were cleared very rapidly. 
Palonosetron was rapidly absorbed in rats and dogs when administered orally. Despite high absorption, 
oral  bioavailability  was  low  in  rats  and  dogs  (6.4%  and  12.5  %  respectively),  attributed  to  a  strong 
firstpass effect in all two species, which suggest the possibility that some animal toxicities may not be 
relevant to humans. A range of metabolites was identified from animal oral studies but many were not 
relevant  to  the  clinical  situation,  being  products  of  first-pass  metabolisms.  In  accordance  with  “the 
guideline  on 
the  non-clinical  development  of 
fixed  combinatons  of  medicinal  products” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005),  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  combination  netupitant/palonosetron 
are not required.

Four single dose studies in mice, rats and dogs.  The major toxicity findings included death, microscopic 
changes in multiple organs and tissues along with signs of phospolipidosis in various organs at the higher 
doses.  Clinical observations amounted to reduced food consumption and loss of body weight and body 
weight gain. An NOAEL of 500 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg were established for the rat and dog, respectively.  
No NOAEL was determined for mice. 
Palonosetron 
Studies were carried out in mouse, rat and dog using intravenous and oral route of administration. Death 
in all species was associated with convulsions and collapse.  
Single dose toxicity studies established a maximum non-lethal intravenous dosage of 10 mg/kg in rats 
and mice and 20 mg/kg in dogs. A maximum non-lethal oral dosage of 250 mg/kg in rats, 100 mg/kg in 
mice  and  50  mg/kg  in  dogs  were  established.  Signs  seen  at  non-lethal  dosages  included  inactivity, 
tremors, ataxia and laboured respiration 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A number of preliminary, non-pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in rat and dog to 
examine the effects of netupitant alone and in combination with palonoestron.  The applicant has provided 
results from a series of non-pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies (<1 month) conducted in mice, rats and 
dogs.  The majority of these studies were performed to GLP and presented preliminary/dose range finding 
for the pivotal studies.  The main findings for netupitant alone amounted to effects on body weight and 
food consumption, changes in clinical chemistry parameters, increased liver and adrenal weight increases 
and occurred at all doses in some studies.  Microscopic findings included changes in the lung, lymphoid 
tissues, liver, adrenal glands, kidney, stomach and trachea. Some of these changes occurring at does as 
low  as  15  mg/kg  were  indicative  of  drug-induced  phospholipidosis  (foamy/vacuolated  macrophage 
infiltration) with associated necrosis.  In combination studies in rats (1 week and 28 day) dosed with 
palonosetron/netupitant (0/0-60/30 mg/kg) reduced body weight and/or body weight gain, reduced food 
consumption, changes in clinical pathology and blood parameters, increases in liver and kidney weights, 
minimal hepatocytic hypertrophy and syncytial macrophages in mesenteric lymph nodes were observed.  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 26/153 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly in dogs, decreases in body weight and food consumption were observed at all dose levels (10/3 
and  20/15  mg/kg  palonosetron/netupitant).    Several  clinical  signs  were  also  seen  relating  to  CNS 
(tremors to severe seizure-like episodes, calm or restless behaviour, abnormal posture, uncoordinated 
movements,  salivation,  squeaking,  head  shaking),  as  well  as  effects  on  heart  (prolonged  ST  and  QT 
intervals)  and  liver  (hepatocyte  hypertrophy)  at  15/7.5  and  20-15/15  mg/kg palonosetron/netupitant 
doses. 
As in the non-pivotal studies, the main toxicity findings observed in rats at higher dose levels were in 
relation to microscopic changes in various organs (liver (hepatocellular vacuolation), lungs (infiltration by 
foamy  macrophages),  spleen  (histiocytosis),  mesenteric  and  mandibular  lymph  nodes  (diffuse 
histiocytosis and histiocytic aggregates)) that were consistent with drug induced phospholipidosis.  These 
changes were completely or at least partially in the case of liver, lung and lymph nodes reversible after an 
8 week recovery period.  No evidence of drug-induced lamellar inclusion bodies was observed at dose up 
to  450  mg.      Reduced  body  weight,  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption,  changes  in  clinical 
parameters  (increased  protein,  globulin,  cholesterol  levels  &  changes  in  various  liver  enzymes)  were 
again  observed  in  these  studies  but  these  were  considered  related  treatment  induced  inflammatory 
changes in some organs and microscopic changes in the liver.  Increased liver and kidney (female only) 
weights were also observed.  NOAELs of 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg were established for the 13 week and the 
26 week repeat-dose toxicity, respectively. 
In the 13 week pivotal study in dogs, mild drug induced phospholipidosis was observed as indicated by 
vacuolated macrophages in lymphoid tissue in the highest dose group (10 mg/kg).  However this was 
reversible upon the 8 week recovery period.  In the 9 month study, slightly longer QT intervals (males 
only) and prolonged PQ intervals were noted in high dose animals but were reversible upon cessation of 
treatment.  Increased  liver  weights  with  correlated  microscopic  evidence  of  minimal  periacinar 
hepatocytic hypertrophy and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in the plasma were also seen in the 
high dose males.  As with all other studies, changes in body weight and body weight gain and reduced 
food consumption were also apparent.  A NOAEL of 3 mg/kg was established for both studies. 
In rat combination studies with palonosetron / netupitant (0, 2/1, 6/3, 18/10, 18/0, or 0/10 mg/kg), the 
main target organs identified were the adrenals in females and liver and mesenteric lymph node in males 
and females.  Toxicities amounted to adrenal zona fasciculate hypertrophy at 118/10 and 0/10 mg/kg 
which was reversible at the end of the recovery period; reversible hepatocytic hypertrophy in high dose 
females at combination therapy (18/10), as well as for males and females with netupitant monotherapy 
(0/10) and for females with palonosetron monotherapy (18/0).  These liver changes were also associated 
with  increased  liver  weights.    Mesenteric  lymph  node  syncytial  macrophages  with  increasing  severity 
were also observed at 6/3 (females), 18/10 (males and females) and 0/10 mg/kg (males and females).  
These  findings  were  not  reversible  at  the  end  of  the  recovery  period  and  are  thought  to  represent  a 
precursor to phospholipidosis which was one of the main toxicity findings seen in the repeat dose toxicity 
studies.  Of note form the toxicokinetic studies, after single administration of the combination product 
some  gender  differences  were  observed  where  exposure  in  males  was  lower  than  that  observed  in 
females  particularly  in  the  6/3  dose  group.  The  NOAEL  for  this  study  was  2/1  mg/kg 
palonosetron/netupitant. 
In  dog  combination  studies  with  palonosetron  /  netupitant  (0,  3/1,  5/3,  or  10/10  mg/kg),  the  main 
toxicities  observed  were  reduced  body  weight  gain  in  females  at  10  mg/kg,  prolonged  ST-  and  QT 
intervals at 10/10 mg/kg and increased liver weights that maintained in some animals until the end of the 
recovery  period  (10  mg/kg).    The  NOAEL  concluded  for  this  study  was  5/3  mg/kg  palonosetron/ 
netupitant. 
Studies submitted for palonosetron to assess the repeated dose toxicity in mice used the oral route. The 
applicant’s  justification  for  performing  oral  studies  to  mimic  the  exposure  profile  during  intravenous 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 27/153 
 
  
  
  
administration in humans was considered acceptable. The CHMP assumes that, with the intended clinical 
human exposure being a single i.v. injection (the intended clinical i.v. dose of palenosetron (0.25mg) 
equates to approximately 0.004 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult), and at a dose many multiples lower than the 
lowest animal i.v NOAEL (7 mg/kg/day and 6 mg/kg/day for rat and dog, respectively), palenosetron, in 
the absence of drug interactions, is safe for the intended use in human. 
Genotoxicity 
Two Ames bacterial cell reverse mutation assays were performed with netupitant.  Owing to precipitation 
and toxicity observed, concentrations from 2 to 200 μg/plate (Study No. 1004078) and from 5 to 500 
μg/plate  and  1  to  100  μg/plate  for  the  plate  incorporation  and  pre-incubation  versions  of  the  assay 
respectively (Study No. 1006128) were tested.  Even at these concentrations, toxic effects were visible at 
the  upper  concentrations,  with  variation  depending  on  strain  and  presence  or  absence  of  metabolic 
activation. Netupitant did not induce any dose related increased of the number of revertant colonies/plate 
in any of the five tester strains examined (Salmonella typhimuriurn: TA1535, TA97, TA98, TAl00 and 
TA102).   Netupitant did not increase the mutant frequency in a mouse lymphoma assay in the absence 
(5.0 to 17.5 μg/mL (3 h treatment) and 1.0 to 7.0 μg/mL (24 h treatment)) or presence of metabolic 
activation (5.0 to 30.0 μg/mL (3 h treatment). No chromosome damage was detected in vivo in rat bone 
marrow micronucleus test at concentrations up to 1000 mg/kg. 
With  palonosetron  in  vitro  bacterial  mutation  and  mammalian  cell  mutation  studies  were  negative.  A 
chromosome  aberration  study  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells  was  positive  without  S9  mix  at 
concentrations  of  201μg/mL  or  more.  A  positive  result  with  S9  mix  at  the  highest  concentration, 
650μg/mL,  was  considered  equivocal.  An  intravenous  mouse  micronucleus  test  at  dosages  up  to 
10mg/kg, and an intravenous rat liver unscheduled DNA study at dosages up to 30mg/kg, were both 
negative. The highest dosages were close to established lethal dosages. Treatment in the rat study was 
associated with clonic convulsions. Based on toxicokinetic data from other studies, high exposures can be 
assumed. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed with netupitant which is considered acceptable given the short 
duration of treatment. 
Two long-term studies assessed the carcinogenic potential of palonosetron in rat and mouse. Although 
the oral gavage route was used in these studies, whereas bolus intravenous is the route of administration 
of  the  proposed  indication,  all  dosages  used  were  multiples  of  the  proposed  human  dosage  and 
comparison of AUC0-24h values indicated large multiples, ranging from 136 to 1220-fold in males and 
from 61 to 706-fold in females. High doses applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver 
tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats 
but  not  in  mice.  The  underlying  mechanisms  are  not  fully  understood,  but  because  ofthe  high  doses 
employed  and  since  palonosetron  is  intended  for  single  application  in  humans,  these  findings  are  not 
considered relevant for clinical use. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, higher numbers of foetuses with tarsal hyperflexion 
and/or  pes  adductus  were  reported  in  rats  at  10  and  30  mg/kg/day.  These  limb  variations  were  not 
associated with alterations in skeletal or soft tissue parts and could be considered related to restricted 
movement in the uterus such as caused by loss of amniotic fluid or crowded uterine horns.  At the NOAEL 
for both maternal and developmental endpoints, there was no safety margin (exposure ratio = 0.6).  
EMA/236963/2015

In  rabbits,  litter  parameters  were  unaffected  except  the  slight  decreases  foetal  body  weight  at  30 
mg/kg/day. Position anomalies of forelimbs and/or hindlimbs and forepaws were noted in dose-related 
manner. At 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, these effects occurred at a higher incidence than in study and historical 
controls.  
A treatment-related increase in the number of minimally/partially fused sternebrae was observed at 10 
mg/kg and 30 mg/kg (fetal incidence: 7.9% and 15.0%; litter incidence: 40% and 58.8%) in the pivotal 
study.  This  finding  occurred  at  a  higher incidence  than  in  study  and  historical  controls  (fusion  and/or 
abnormal shape of 2 or more sternebrae: 1.1%-8%), and is considered as a malformation in spite of the 
lack of reduction in inter-sternebral spaces. 
Agenesis of accessory lung lobe was observed at a higher incidence at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (25%-29%) than 
in study controls (10%) or in historical controls. As regards historical control data, it is limited to 5 studies 
(the current study being excluded). The incidence of absent accessory lung lobe ranged from 0% to 23%, 
with incidence exceeding 15% in only one study (0%, 0%, 9%, 14%; 23%). Overall, a treatment-related 
effect is considered given the increased incidence of this malformation in treated rabbits. 
Palonosetron oral application to rats (one –month repeat-dose toxicity study in rat) was associed with 
degeneration of the seminferous epithelium, this was not observed in i.v. fertility studies, leading to the 
conclusion that this toxic effect might be due to metabolites. Reproductive and developmental studies 
conducted were overall acceptable and the NOAELs were high enough to allow a reasonable assumption 
of  safety  in  human.  No  treatment-related  teratogenic  effets  were  seen  with  palonosetron.  Maternal 
toxicity was the limiting factor in the embyo-foetal studies. Overall the reproductive and developmental 
studies conducted were appropriate and the NOAELs were high enough to allow a reasonable assumption 
of safety in human. 
In  accordance  with  “the  guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combinatons  of  medicinal 
products”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005),  no  embryo-foetal  development  studies  with  combination 
netupitant/palonosetron are not required.

**: data from day 29 ***: data from day 5, only from male animals 
Pivotal study toxicokinetics 
In the 13 week study in rat, maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 426/553 and AUC 
(0-24h) values were 2550/6070 h.ng.mL (male/females) on day 91 at the NOAEL dose of 3 mg/kg/day. 
Plasma concentrations of netupitant in male and female rats were similar although there was a tendency 
to higher plasma concentrations in female than in male rats. An accumulation of netupitant was observed 
throughout the study. A high exposure to the main metabolite M1 was observed with AUC(0-24h) values 
of 14300/12500 h.ng/mL in male/female rats at the NOAEL dose. In 26 week study in rat, maximum 
plasma concentrations of netupitant were 126/318 and AUC (0-24h) values were 7150/11100 h.ng.mL 
(male/females) on at the NOAEL dose of 1 mg/kg/day. An accumulation of netupitant and metabolites M1 
in week 4 compared to week 1. A high exposure to the main metabolite M1 was observed with 
AUC(0-24h) values of 14300/12500 h.ng/mL in male/female rats at the NOAEL dose. 
Palonosetron/Netupitant combination treatment did not appear to have a significant effect on exposure to 
netupitant or metabolite M1 compared to netupitant alone. 
In the 13 week dog study maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 324/342 ng/mL and 
AUC(0-24h) were 3520/3970 h.ng/mL (female/male) on day 87. Slight to moderate accumulation was 
evident compared to day zero values. In all dosing groups there was a tendency for higher plasma 
concentrations of netupitant and all three metabolites in male than in female dogs. AUC(0-24) was 
5780/5740 h.ng/mL in males/females. There was a high accumulation of M1 with mean accumulation 
factors ranging from 2.2 to 2.9 in females and from 2.4 to 4.3 in males, and a dose proportional increase 
between 1 and 10 mg/kg. TK parameters for netupitant in the 3-month combination study was 
approximately similar to that in the 28-day combination therapy study in dogs, although AUC levels in 
males apeared to be increased in 5P/3N males. 
In the 9 month study maximum plasma concentrations of netupitant were 466/417and AUC (0-24h) 
values were 6280/5520 h.ng/mL (male/females) at the NOAEL dose. Cmax and AUC increased generally in 
a dose proportional manner over the dose range of 1 to 3 mg/kg and from 3 to 10 mg/kg, with ratios for 
Cmax ranging from 2.1-5.4 and 1.7-3.2 respectively. AUC ratios were 2.2-4.8 and 2.2-4.2 respectively. 
Cmax and AUC increased generally in a dose proportional manner over the dose range of 1 to 3 mg/kg and 
from 3 to 10 mg/kg, with ratios for Cmax ranging from 2.1-5.4 and 1.7-3.2 respectively. AUC ratios were 
2.2-4.8 and 2.2-4.2 respectively. AUC values slightly increased over time in males and females at all dose 
levels. Netupitant and its metabolites M1, M2 and M3 was similar in males and females, and showed dose 
proportional kinetics. Netupitant accumulated slightly, in terms of AUC, in both sexes at all dose levels. 
Local Tolerance  
In  an  intravenous  local  tolerance  study  in  rabbits,  marked  local  non-reversible  reactions  along  with 
increased neutrophils and monocytes were noted at 10 mg/kg i.v. However, netupitant was considered 
non-irritating and non-sensitising to eye and skin of rabbits and albino guinea pigs.  The relevance of 
EMA/236963/2015

these studies is limited owing to the proposed clinical oral indication. For palonosetron, no evidence of 
local  tolerance  toxicity  was  observed  in  the  i.v.  toxicology  investigations.  In  accordance  with  “the 
guideline  on 
the  non-clinical  development  of 
fixed  combinatons  of  medicinal  products” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), local tolerance studies with combination netupitant/palonosetron are 
not required. 
Other toxicity studies 
The possible phototoxic potential of netupitant was examined in vitro by the 3T3 fibroblast Neutral Red 
uptake assay. Netupitant absorbs UV light between 240 and 380 nm. Murine fibroblasts were incubated 
for 1 h with 0.75-96.0 μg/mL netupitant in the presence of UVA exposure and in the dark. Under these 
experimental conditions netupitant was considered to be non-phototoxic. 
Neputipant was not antigenic in male guinea pigs tested for active systemic and for passive anaphylaxis 
(Study No. 1007385; GLP). Neputipant did not appear to be phototoxic, irritating or sensitizing and was 
not antigenic.  
The  genotoxic  potential  of  impurities  was  evaluated  by  SARS  analysis  (Derek).  The  results  of  this 
assessment  were  negative.    Furthermore,  the  specified  impurities  12-NETU  and  14-NETU  i10  were 
negative  in  an  Ames  test in  the  absence  or  presence  of  S9  metabolism  at  concentrations  up  to  5000 
μg/plate. 
Given that an additional metabolite M4 was detected in clinical studies, the mutagenic potential of this 
metabolite was examined in an Ames assay.  The M4 metabolite was considered to be non-mutagenic in 
the Ames assay.  Moreover, an IC50 of 66.6 µg/ml for the M4 metabolite was obtained in the in vitro 
cytotoxicity assay in BALB/C 3T3 cells.  Given that the M4 systemic exposure (AUC) is 3% of netupitant 
systemic exposure, the results of the in vitro studies sufficiently characterise this metabolite. 
For  palonosetron  in  vitro  photo-cytotoxicity  and  photo-clastogenicity  tests,  and  a  photo-allergenicity 
investigation  that  included  a  preliminary  single-dose  photo-irritation  study  were  conducted  and  no 
evidence  of  phototoxicity  were  observed.  In  accordance  with  “the  guideline  on  the  non-clinical 
development  of  fixed  combinatons  of  medicinal  products”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005),  others 
toxicity studies with combination netupitant/palonosetron are not required.

Palonosetron PEC surfacewater is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, palonosetron is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Netupitant PEC surfacewater is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L but log Kow exceeds 4.5 As a result the 
available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of netupitant to the environment.  
The applicant has initiated a tiered risk assessment with regards to PBT in a stepwise manner: 
 Step 1) OECD 301 Ready Biodegradability Test; 
Step 2) OECD 308 Sediment-Water Transformation Test; 
Step 3) OECD 305 Bioconcentration Test with Fish; 
Step 4) OECD 201 (Algae), 210 (Fish Early Life Stage) and 211 (Daphnia Reproduction). 
From work completed (OECD 301 Ready Biodegradability Test), netupitant was not considered readily 
biodegradable.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends for further investigation: To conduct the remaining studies and submit the data upon 
finalisation.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  accordance  with  “the  guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combinations  of  medicinal 
products” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), the repeat-dose and dependance studies with combination 
netupitant / palonosetron were performed and no other studies are required. 
In the non-clinical studies the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological effects of netupitant 
alone and in combination with palonoestron have been sufficiently characterised. 
The  pharmacodynamic  studies  provide  sufficient  proof  of  efficacy  (antineoplastic-induced  emesis  in 
ferrets & inhibition of NK1 agonist-induced foot-tapping in gerbils) for the individual actives alone as well 
as in combination with palonosetron.  
Interactions at the histamine (H2), adenosine (A3), DA and 5-HT reuptake sites, L-type Ca2+ channel 
and diltiazem binding site on the Ca2+ channel were observed with netupitant.  However, taking into 
account the protein binding for both netupitant and palonosetron, the free plasma concentration of both 
drugs were well below the concentrations that are reported to affect binding sites at H2, A3 receptors, DA, 
5-HT  reuptake  and  L-type  and  diltiazem  binding  sites,  thus  significant  clinical  interactions  are  not 
expected at therapeutic dose on these mechanism. 
In further binding studies, the netupitant main metabolites, M1 was shown to interact at the L-type Ca2+ 
channel (IC50 = 2.8 μM; Ki = 1.4 μM).  However, given the low systemic exposure to the M1 metabolite 
in  human  studies,  the  interaction  of  M1  with  L-type  Ca2+  channel  is  unlikely  to  have  any  clinical 
implications.  This is further supported by the lack of any significant cardiovascular side effects observed 
in human studies. 
Cardiovascular effects were observed in conscious dogs with netupitant and its main metabolite M1. Since 
M1 has a major role in the QT prolongation and it is present in higher concentrations in dogs than in 
humans,  the  findings  obtained  in  animals  are  not  considered  to  be  directly  correlated  to  human 
cardiotoxicity.    This  is  further  supported  by  the  lack  of  significant  changes  of  QT  prolongation  with 
netupitant alone and in combination with palonosetron in a thorough QT prolongation study (Study No. 
NETU-07-20)  and  in  a  phase  I  clinical  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  (Study  No.  NP16603/1007847  & 
NP16601-1014020). 
For palonosetron, in rats changes were mainly detected in bone, kidney, testis, adrenal zona glomerulosa 
and  spleen.  The  target  organs  in  the  dogs  were  thymus  and  liver.  The  CHMP  assumed  that,  with  the 
intended clinical human exposure and at a dose many multiples lower than the lowest animal i.v NOAEL 
was safe for the intended use in human. 
While the M3 metabolite had comparable pharmacological activity with respect to netupitant, the toxicity 
profile  of  the  metabolite  (outside  of  the  well  characterised  cardiovascular  effects)  in  the  pivotal 
repeat-dose studies is unclear.  However, given that M3 AUC concentrations in the 4 week dogs study 
following higher doses of netupitant were equivalent to the expected clinical exposure, and that patients 
will  only  receive  a  single  dose  prior  to  the  chemotherapy  cycle,  it  can  be  accepted  that  the  lack  of 
exposure in the pivotal toxicity studies does not pose a significant clinical safety risk. 
In vitro CYP450 inhibition studies indicated a potential for clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions, with 
both netupitant and metabolite M1. A concentration dependent inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated docetaxel 
inhibition was also seen, with an IC50 of 3.7 uM. The interaction is described in the SmPC. Induction of 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 was not seen in human hepatocytes. Based on the C max/IC50 ratio, 
interaction with BCRP is considered a possibility and is highlighted in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 35/153 
 
  
  
  
 
At  higher  dose  levels  microscopic  changes  in  various  organs  (liver  (hepatocellular  vacuolation),  lungs 
(infiltration  by  foamy  macrophages),  spleen  (histiocytosis),  mesenteric  and  mandibular  lymph  nodes 
(diffuse histiocytosis and histiocytic aggregates)) that were consistent with drug induced phospholipidosis 
were shown in rats and dogs.  These changes were completely or at least partially in the case of liver, lung 
and  lymph  nodes  reversible  after  an  8  week  recovery  period.    Furthermore,  risk  of  phospholipidosis 
induction in humans was examined in a Phase I clinical trial where peripheral lymphocytes were isolated 
and examined for the presence of lamellar bodies.  No evidence of drug-induced lamellar inclusion bodies 
was observed at doses up to 450 mg. 
No clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were observed in the completed Phase I studies and review 
of  adverse  events  (AEs)  from  the  completed  Phase  III  studies  showed  that  overall  slightly  higher 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  netupitant/palonosetron  combination  group  had  liver  transaminases 
increased  (AEs  in  the  Investigations  SOC)  in  comparison  to  palonosetron  group  but  none  of  these 
laboratory abnormalities was assessed as a serious AE. The toxicological significance of PLD is still unclear 
in humans, but considering the evidence of toxicity and adverse functional changes in non-clinical studies 
“phospholipidosis” was included as an important potential risk in the RMP and in 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Alteration  of  hepatic  structure  and  function  has  been  observed  in  non-clinical  studies.  The  review  of 
adverse events from the Phase III studies showed that overall slightly higher proportion of patients in the 
netupitant/palonosetron combination group had liver transaminases increased (AEs in the Investigations 
SOC) in comparison to palonosetron group, with no impact on hepatic function. None of these laboratory 
abnormalities was assessed as a serious AE, but the applicant proposed to include “liver transaminases 
increase” as an important potential risk in 4.8 of the SmPC and this was agreed by the CHMP. 
Administration of netupitant to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was shown to increase the 
incidence  of  some  foetal  malformations:  limb  and  paw  positional  anomalies,  minimal/partial  fusion  of 
sternebrae,  and  agenesis  of  accessory  lung  lobe.  The  NOAEL  for  embryo-fetal  development  is  3 
mg/kg/day.  Taking into account the teratogen effect of netupitant in rabbit without a safety margin, a 
contraindication of AKYNZEO during pregnancy with a contraception measure for women of childbearing 
potential was included into the SmPC. 
The applicant has initiated a tiered risk assessment with regards to PBT.  From work completed (OECD 
301 Ready Biodegradability Test), netupitant was not considered readily biodegradable.  The remaining 
studies are underway or are being planned. In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due 
account of technical and scientific progress full and final reports are recommended to be submitted when 
completed for final assessment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  main  toxicities  observed  during  the  non-clinical  development  of  netupitant  were  in  relation  to 
phospholipidosis and QT prolongation.  These toxicities were partially if not fully reversible upon cessation 
of  treatment.    Moreover,  the  toxicities  appear  to  be  related  to  continued  administration  and  to  the 
abundance  of  the  M1  metabolite  both  in  the  rat  and  dogs.    Lamellar  inclusion  bodies  (biomarker  of 
phospholipidosis)  after  single  and  multiple  administration  doses  of  netupitant up  to  450  mg  were  not 
detected in humans while no significant changes of QT prolongation were seen in the TQT study in healthy 
volunteers. Appropriate information was included in section 5.3 of the product information. 
In view of a number of foetoxic findings observed in the rabbit reprotoxicity studies’, a teratogenic risk of 
the FDC is probable. Alternative treatment options are available in this indication. Therefore Akynzeo has 
been  contraindicated  in  pregnant  women  and  it  is  advised  in  the  SmPC  that  women  of  childbearing 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 36/153 
 
  
  
  
 
potential  must  use  effective  contraception  during  therapy.  The  SmPC  of  Akynzeo  in  section  5.3 
summarizes the foetotoxic effects seen in animal studies seen with netupitant and in combination with 
palonosetron  such  as  an  increased  number  of  minimally/partially  fused  sternebrae,  cleft  palate, 
microphthalmia and aphakia and lobular agenesis of the lung. 
Overall, the non-clinical data for the FDC are considered appropriate to support the proposed indication.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron are already well characterised, this section will focus predominantly 
on the pharmacokinetics of netupitant. More than one fixed dose formulation of the fixed dose formulations 
has been investigated in PK studies as well as extemporaneous combinations of palonsetron and netupitant 
which were used in the earlier PK studies. 
Overall 23 PK studies were submitted in the dossier including five bioequivalent studies. Proposed analytical 
methods were adequate and had been satisfactorily validated. 
Absorption 
• 
Bioavailability 
Netupitant 
Bioequivalence studies were presented to investigate the PK of the  formulation to be used commercially. 
Absolute  bioavailability  studies  with  the  palonseteron/netupitant  combination  were  not  carried  out  in 
humans.  Based  on  two  studies  with  IV  netupitant  (BP17085  and  NETU-11-01)  the  oral  bioavailability  in 
humans was greater than 60%. 
A number of studies were undertaken which enable the characterisation of the extent of absorption in healthy 
volunteers (NETU-11-23, NETU-08-12, NETU-09-07 and NETU-11-02). 
Overall measurable plasma netupitant concentrations were detected between 15 minutes and 3 hours after 
dosing in single dose oral studies. After this lag time, plasma concentrations followed a first order absorption 
process  and  reached  Cmax  in  approximately  4-5  hours.  Netupitant  is  eliminated  from  the  body  in  a 
multi-exponential fashion, with an apparent mean elimination half-life ranging from 30 to approximately 100 
hours (across all studies for doses of 30 mg to 450 mg) with a few longer outliers. 
Palonosetron 
After single oral doses using buffered solution mean maximum palonosetron concentrations (C max) and area 
under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) were dose proportional over the dose range of 3.0 to 80 μg/kg 
in healthy subjects.  
In 36 healthy male and female subjects given a single oral dose of 500 mcg palonosetron, maximum plasma 
palonosetron concentration (Cmax) was 0.81 ± 1.66 ng/mL (mean ± SD) and time to maximum concentration 
(Tmax) was 5.1 ± 1.7 hours. In female subjects (n=18), the mean AUC was 35% higher and the mean C max 
was 26% higher than in male subjects (n=18). In 12 cancer patients given a single oral dose of palonosetron 
500 mcg one hour prior to chemotherapy, Cmax was 0.93 ± 0.34 ng/mL and Tmax was 5.1 ± 5.9 hours. The 
AUC was 30% higher in cancer patients than in healthy subjects. 
• 
Influence of food 
The  influence  of  food  was  investigated  in  two  PK  studies  an  older  study  conducted  by  Roche  in  2002 
(NP16600D) and a more recent one conducted by Helsinn Birex in 2010 (NETU-10-12).  
NP 16600 was an open labelled randomised cross over study with 12 healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 
years of age) who  received a single oral dose of 300mg Ro-67 3189 (netupitant) on two occasions 
under  fasting  and  fed  conditions.  There  was  a  minimum  of  a  two  week  washout  period  between 
EMA/236963/2015

treatments.    Blood  samples  for  PK  assessment  were  taken  pre-dose,  15  minutes  and  45  minutes 
post-dose and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours post-dose. One subject 
was withdrawn from the study. 
Following oral administration of 300 mg of the study drug, the plasma concentration of RO0673189 increased 
in  a  first  order  fashion.  The  relative  exposure  and  95%  confidence  intervals  for  treatment  under  fed 
conditions  compared  to  fasting  treatment  were  determined  based  on  the  results  from  ANOVA  on 
log-transformed parameters. The plasma exposure, judged by peak plasma concentration and AUC of the 
parent compound, increased by between 69% (Cmax) and 47% (AUClast), in the fed compared to the fasted 
state. 
Amongst healthy subjects, the impact of food on the bioavailability of RO0673189 ranged from no effect to > 
3-fold increase.

NETU-10-12  was  an  open,  randomised,  two-way,  cross-over  study  in  24  healthy  male  and  female  adult 
volunteers  (aged 22 to 45 years) to investigate the effect of food on the PK of netupitant and palonosetron 
of a single dose of a fixed dose oral combination netupitant and palonosetron (300mg/0.5mg). 
Blood samples for netupitant and its metabolites were taken on D1 for each period at pre-dose as well as 1, 
2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 192, and 240 hours post-dose 
Two subjects in the cross-over part were excluded from the statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic data as 
they did not have two evaluable treatment periods for pharmacokinetics:

For  netupitant,  the  ANOVA  point  estimates  and  90%  CI  for  the  treatment  ratios  T  (high  fat  breakfast)/R 
(fasted)  for  AUC0-tz,  AUC0-∞,  and  Cmax  were  117.88%  (106,66%,  130,27%)  115.96%  (104.54%; 
128.62%) and 117.74% (100.65%; 137.74%), respectively. The upper limits of the 90% CIs were above the 
no-effect limit of 125% for all three parameters. The lower limits of the 90% CI were within the no-effect 
limits of 80% to 125%. However, the lower limits were above 100.00%. A statistically significant treatment 
effect was observed for AUC0-tz and 
AUC0-∞  (p  =  0.0102,  and  p  =  0.0230,  Table  12).  A  significant  period  or  sequence  effect  was  not  seen 
(p>0.05) for any of the three parameters. The ANOVA CV was higher for Cmax (30.87%) than for AUC0-tz and 
AUC0-∞ (19.41% and 20.13%). 
For palonosetron, the ANOVA point estimates and 90% CI for the treatment ratios T/R for AUC0-tz, AUC0-∞, 
and Cmax were 99.29% (94.51%; 104.30%), 99.99% (95.41%; 104.79), and 99.00% (93.05%; 105.33%), 
respectively.  The  limits  of  the  90%  CIs  were  within  the  no-effect  limits  of  80%  to  125%  for  all  three 
parameters. No significant effects of treatment, period or sequence were seen (p>0.05, Table 13). There is 
no food effect for palonosetron. 
Distribution 
The mean Vd for netupitant in humans generally ranged from approximately 850 L to over 2000 L, indicating 
substantial  distribution  to  tissues.  Nonclinical  data  also  show  that  netupitant  is  extensively  distributed  to 
EMA/236963/2015

tissues following single or multiple (7 days) oral dosing in the rat. The drug is highly bound to plasma proteins 
(> 99%) with apparently no large differences in free fraction between healthy subjects and patients with 
hepatic failure.  
Palonosetron  at  the  recommended  doses  is  widely  distributed  in  the  body  (volume  of  distribution  of 
approximately 8.3±2.5 L/kg) and approximately 62% is found as bound to human-plasma proteins. 
• 
Distribution in cancer chemotherapy patients 
Data on distribution in cancer chemotherapy patients comes from the a population PK analysis (NETU-10-02), 
performed in association with the Phase 3 study NETU-08-18.  
Netupitant disposition was characterized by a 2-compartment model with an estimated median systemic CL 
of 20.5 L/h and a large volume of the central (486 L) and peripheral compartments (1170 L), respectively. 
These estimates for CL and volume indicated that the drug was extensively distributed in body tissues and the 
plasma elimination was rapid. 
Elimination 
• 
Excretion 
Netupitant is primarily excreted via hepatic/biliary routes, with renal clearance (CLr) accounting for less than 
5% of CL. In early studies, 3 active metabolites were identified (M1, M2 and M3). In plasma from humans who 
were administered oral netupitant, netupitant and its 3 major metabolites were extensively bound (> 97%) 
to plasma protein at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1500 ng/mL. 
In  an  open  label  label,  single  dose  study  (NETU-09-21)  in  6  healthy  males  designed  to  assess  the  mass 
balance  recovery,  PK,  metabolic  profile  and  metabolic  identification  of  300mg  [14C]-netupitant, 
approximately half the administered dose of radioactivity was recovered within 120 h of dosing. However, for 
all  subjects,  insufficient  radioactivity  data  (ie  <90%)  was  recovered  by  336  h.  Therefore,  subjects  were 
required  to  collect  faeces  samples  for  a  24  h  period  (456  to  480  h)  at  home,  and  both  faeces  and  urine 
samples for an additional 24 h period (672 to 696 h) in the clinic. 
Based on the total radioactivity recovered in all samples, including the additional collection periods, total 
radioactivity from the urine accounted for 3.95% (range 2.2% to 4.6%) of the dose and total radioactivity 
from the faeces accounted for 70.7% (range 62.1% to 75.2%) of the dose at 696 h post-dose. These data 
indicate  that  the  hepatic/biliary  route,  rather  than  renal  clearance,  is  the  major  elimination  route  for 
drug-related entities. 
The mean recovery from subjects after the second additional 24 h collection was subsequently estimated to 
be approximately 90% (based on the assumption that the excretion was proceeding at a steadily decreasing 
rate). Including the extrapolated values for the periods 336 to 456 h and 480 to 672 h, the total drug-related 
material to have been excreted by 696 h post-dose via the faeces was estimated to be 86.49%; a mean of 
4.75% of drug-related material was estimated to have been excreted in the urine for the same time period. 
Palonosetron  is  eliminated  by  multiple  routes  with  approximately  50%  metabolized  to  form  two  primary 
metabolites. 
Following administration of a single oral 0.75 mg dose of [14C] palonosetron to six healthy subjects, 85% to 
93% of the total radioactivity was excreted in urine, and 5% to 8% was eliminated in faeces. The amount of 
unchanged palonosetron excreted in the urine represented approximately 40% of the administered dose. In 
healthy subjects given palonosetron capsules 500 mcg, the terminal elimination half-life (t½) of palonosetron 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 48/153 
 
  
  
  
was  37  ±  12  hours  (mean  ±  SD),  and  in  cancer  patients,  t½  was  48  ±  19  hours.  After  a  single  dose  of 
approximately  0.75  mg  intravenous  palonosetron,  the  total  body  clearance  of  palonosetron  in  healthy 
subjects was 160 ± 35 mL/h/kg (mean ± SD) and renal clearance was 66.5± 18.2 mL/h/kg. 
• 
Metabolism 
Four metabolites have been detected in human plasma at netupitant doses of 30 mg and higher (M1, M2, M3 
and M4). M1, M2 and M3 are considered major metabolites. M4 was identified as a minor metabolite (< 10% 
exposure of the parent) late in the development process in study NETU-09-21. 
In NETU-09-21 netupitant was shown to undergo extensive metabolism, forming both phase I and phase II 
metabolites. Phase I metabolites observed included those formed through N-demethylation (mono and bis), 
mono  and  di-hydroxylation,  N-oxidation,  desaturation,  N-formylation,  oxidation  and  reduction  to  a  keto 
group, and oxidation to an acid (including oxidation of the toluene methyl group to an acid). Intermediate 
metabolites  in  the  1-methylpiperazine  degradation  pathway  to  the  further  oxidised  6-amino-pyridinyl 
derivatives  were  also  observed.  Phase  II  metabolites  included  those  formed  by  glucuronidation  and 
conjugation to a hexose (C6 sugar) group. A glucuronic acid conjugate of the acid-half molecule of netupitant 
was also observed in urine.  
Analysis  of  the  plasma  samples  for  the  metabolites  M1,  M2,  and  M3  indicated  that  based  on  the  AUC0-t 
values, metabolites M1, M2 and M3 represented 9.8%, 4.8% and 11.3% of the total radioactivity exposure 
and  netupitant  represented  34.0%  of  the  total  radioactivity  exposure.  Exposure  to  M1,  M2  and  M3  as  a 
percentage  of  netupitant  exposure  (based  on  AUC0-t  values)  was  approximately  29%,  14%  and  33%, 
respectively.  
These results confirm that M1, M2, and M3 are all major metabolites of netupitant and account for >10% of 
parent  drug  exposure.  A  fourth  metabolite,  M4  (N-oxide,  N-demethyl  derivative,  see    Figure  10)  was 
discovered during this study, having a peak at the same location as the parent. M4 had a Cmax <7% of the 
parent.  (M4  PK  parameters  were  confirmed  in  study  NETU-11-23,  showing  a  systemic  exposure  of 
approximately 3% compared to the parent). 
M1, M2 and M3 were all shown to be pharmacologically active in in a gerbil foot tapping NK1 assay. M3 was 
the most potent and M2 the least active.

Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Netupitant is primarily metabolized via hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4.  In general, genetic polymorphism of 
CYP3A4 results in a decrease in enzyme activity, but occurs in a small proportion of the population across all 
of  the  affected  alleles  and  are  not  expected  to  lead  to  clinical  relevant  increase  in  netupitant  exposure. 
Specific studies to evaluate effect of genetic polymorphism of CYP3A4 on  netupitant disposition were not 
conducted. 
Palonosetron  is  eliminated  by  multiple  routes  with  approximately  50%  metabolized  to  form  two  primary 
metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron M9 and 6-hydroxy-palonosetron M4. These metabolites each have less

than 1% of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. The N-oxide metabolite M9 (08-PALO-D1), 
accounted for approximately 13% of the IV and oral dose, and metabolite M4 (08-PALO-M4), represented 
approximately 11% of the dose after IV administration and approximately 17% after oral administration. In 
vitro  metabolism  studies  have  suggested  that  CYP2D6  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  CYP3A4  and  CYP1A2  are 
involved  in  the  metabolism  of  palonosetron.  However,  clinical  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are  not 
significantly  different  between  poor  and  extensive  metabolizers  of  CYP2D6  substrates  (PALO-99-39). 
Moreover, in vitro testing indicated that palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 isozymes at 
clinically  relevant  concentrations.  Palonosetron  is  almost  exclusively  metabolised  by  cytochrome  P450, 
primarily via CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A and CYP1A2. Small amounts of M9 were present in the 
plasma relative to the parent compound in all studies. Exposure, as measured by AUC, to M9 was generally 
less  than  10%  after  both  oral  and  IV  administration  in  healthy  volunteers  and  CINV  patients.  Plasma 
concentrations of palonosetron generally increased with increasing doses, similar to what was observed with 
IV  dosing.  Dose  proportionality  of  M9  was  generally  observed.  Exposure  to  M4  was  measured  in  cancer 
patients. At 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg dose of palonosetron, when M4 concentrations were measurable, there was 
high variability between patients. Overall mean exposure ranged from 9-16% compared to the parent. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
A double-blind placebo controlled single ascending oral dose study (NP16603) was conducted in 2003  to 
assess the tolerability, safety, PK, and  PD of  netupitant (RO0673189)after single oral ascending doses in 
healthy male volunteers. Five dose levels were investigated 10, 30, 100, 300 and 450. For each dose group 
four subjects were randomly assigned to netupitant and 2 to placebo. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic 
analysis were collected pre-dose and at 15 and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 
144 and 168 h post-dose.  
Following  a  lag  time  of  up  to  3  hours,  netupitant  was  absorbed  in  a  first-order  fashion,  with  Cmax  being 
reached at approximately 5 hours post-dose (see Table 4). For doses up to 300 mg, there was a statistically 
significant  over-proportional  increase  with  dose  in  Cmax,  AUClast  and  AUC0-∞ 
Dose-proportionality was observed between the 300 mg and 450 mg doses, with ratios being close to one. 
for  netupitant. 
RO0673189  (netupitant)  showed  a  statistically  significant  over-proportional  increase  with  dose  for  Cmax 
(p=0.0001), AUClast (p=0.0002) and AUCinf (p<0.0001) for doses up to 300 mg. The measures of deviation 
from dose-proportionality between the 100 mg and 300 mg doses are 1.48, 1.77 and 1.75 respectively for 
Cmax,  AUCinf  and  AUClast.  For  the  300  mg  and  450  mg  doses,  the  increase  in  exposure  appears  to  be 
dose-proportional, with ratios for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf all being close to one. 
Metabolites  RO0681133  (M1),  RO0713001  (M2)  and  RO0731519  (M3)  were  measured  in  plasma  for  the 
30mg  doses  of  netupitant  upwards.  Exposure  to  metabolites  was  considerably  lower  than  to  parent 
compound, with Cmax values of one tenth to one fifth of parent levels and AUC values between one twentieth 
and one third of the parent compound.  
Metabolite RO0681133 (M1), was dose proportional for Cmaxbut not AUClast. The increase in AUClast was over 
proportional for doses from 10mg to 300mg but not from 300 mg to 450 mg.  For RO0713001 (M2), none of 
the parameters showed a statistically significant deviation from dose-proportionality. For RO0731519 (M3) 
there was an over-proportional increase in AUClast but a dose proportional increase in Cmaxwith increasing 
doses of netupitant.

Dose proportionality in multiple ascending doses of netupitant 
A fed study (NP16601) was undertaken to assess the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of netupitant 
following one week daily oral dosing in ascending fashion in healthy volunteers. The study also included 3 
elderly  volunteers,  however  only  two  completed  the  study.  Results  are  presented  for  the  non-elderly 
population only as a full plasma concentration profile was only available for one elderly person.. 
Exposure to netupitant showed a slightly greater than proportional increase with dose. For Day 1, there was 
statistically significant evidence against dose proportionality for AUC(0-23.5) and Cmax. After 7 doses, there was 
statistically significant evidence against dose proportionality for AUC(0-23.5) but for Cmax the results were of 
borderline significance (p=0.062). For both parameters, the results for the 300 mg and 450 mg doses were 
higher on days 1 and 7 than would be expected if dose proportionality held. 
In  keeping  with  its  long  estimated  half-life,  these  data  showed  increase  in  netupitant  exposure  of 
approximately  3-fold  after  7  days’  dosing.  Results  of  the  ANOVA  confirmed  that  the  accumulation  of 
netupitant by Day 7 was statistically significant for both AUC(0-23.5) and Cmax. 
Overall the PK data showed an increase in netupitant exposure of approximately 3-fold after 7 days of dosing. 
This  is  consistent  with  the  long  t1/2  of  the  compound.  Mean  maximum  plasma  concentrations  and  AUC 
(0-23.5) values recorded on Days 1 and 7 of dosing with 100, 300 or 450 mg of netupitant are shown in Table 
17. Exposure netupitant showed a slightly greater than proportional increase with dose. The small magnitude 
of this effect is considered unlikely to have any clinical relevance.

Time dependency 
Netupitant 
In a multiple ascending dose study (NP16601), after oral daily administration of 300mg netupitant for 7 days, 
systemic exposure on Day 7 increased 2.7-fold as compared to Day 1, as expected on the basis of the long 
drug  half-life.    Assuming  that    on    Day    7    netupitant  plasma    levels    approach  steady    state,    the    PK 
parameters  CL/F,  Vz/F  and  t1/2   were  calculated  from  AUC0-23.5   values  determined  on  Day  7.  These 
parameters remain substantially unchanged on Day 7 as compared to findings of single dose studies (e.g., 
NP16599, NETU-10-11, NETU-10-12). Hence, time-dependent pharmacokinetics of netupitant is unlikely.

Palonosetron 
In study PALO-02-12, the PK profile of palonosetron was studied after IV administration of 0.25 mg daily 
doses for 3 consecutive days. A 2-fold increase in systemic exposure was estimated on Day 3 as compared to 
Day 1, which is consistent with the long plasma elimination half-life of palonosetron. The main PK parameters 
for palonosetron are summarized in the following table.

Assuming that on Day 3 palonosetron plasma levels approach steady state, CL, Vz and t1/2 were calculated 
from the AUC0-24 estimates on Day 3. These PK parameters did not change following multiple dosing as 
compared  to  the  CL,  Vz  and  t1/2  values  observed  after  single  IV  dose  studies  (e.g.,  studies  2091  and 
PALO-04-21). Therefore, time-dependent pharmacokinetics of palonosetron appears to be unlikely. 
Inter-individual variability 
Netupitant 
No clear patterns between inter-individual variability and dose emerged e.g. CV% for the 30mg single dose 
in NP 16603 was 55.83% and for the 300mg dose was 24.9%. In NP16601 CV% for the 300mg dose on day 
1 was 26.5% similar to that for NP16603 (these were both fed studies). Inter-individual variation appeared 
to be higher in fasted studies (49.05% in those in the fasted study of NP16600 and 41.9% in those in the 
fasted study in NETU-10-12). 
Inter-subject variability was higher for those in the hepatic impairment PK trial from 54.8, 55.2 and 63.8% 
respectively  for  mild,  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  respectively  (NETU-10-10),  in  some 
interaction  studies  e.g  netupitant  and  etoposide  (49.05%)  and  in  the  elderly  (NETU-10-12)  where 
inter-subject variability was 54.4%. The inter subject variability of palonosetron was lower, with a variability 
of 20 to 29%.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
• 
PK in cancer patients 
The  PK  of  netupitant  and  its  metabolites  were  evaluated  in  a  drug  interaction  study  (NETU-10-09)  and 
population PK study NETU-10-02 (performed in association with the Phase 3 study NETU-08-18.  
In study NETU-10-09, male and female cancer patients were treated with the netupitant/palonosetron FDC 
and docetaxel, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with other chemotherapy agents, 
provided they were not inhibitors, inducers or substrates of CYP3A4. Overall, exposure to netupitant and its 
metabolites in terms of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞  values were consistent with previous data reported in 
healthy subjects and generally appeared to be independent of the chemotherapeutic regimen administered. 
Variability  was  high  (50  to  70%)  for  Cmax  and  moderate  for  other  parameters.  Mean  t1/2  ranged  from 
approximately 70 h to 90 h, consistent with the known profile of netupitant, and were not different across the 
3 treatment groups. Exposure to netupitant metabolite M1 and M3 relative to netupitant was 8 to 14% for 
Cmax and approximately 30 to 35% for AUC0-t. Exposure to netupitant metabolite M2 relative to netupitant 
ranged  from  approximately  45  to  70%  for  Cmax  and  from  20  to  30%  for  AUC0-t.  These  data  are  also 
consistent with previous data in healthy subjects. 
Overall, mean PK parameters of palonosetron in cancer patients from Study NETU-10-09 with the FDC were 
consistent  with  its  known  PK  profile  and  support  previous  studies  in  both  healthy  volunteers  and  cancer 
patients.  Mean  palonosetron  PK  variables  from  this  study  indicated  a  slightly  higher  exposure  (Cmax  and 
AUC0-∞) and longer t1/2 in patients receiving docetaxel, compared to etoposide or cyclophosphamide, with 
moderate variability. 
In the population PK analysis (NETU-10-02), netupitant disposition was characterized by a 2-compartment 
model  with  an  estimated median  systemic  CL  of  20.5  L/h  and  a  large  volume  of  the  central  (486  L)  and 
peripheral compartments (1170 L), respectively. These estimates for CL and volume indicated that the drug 
was extensively distributed in body tissues and the plasma elimination was rapid. Based on the PK model 
parameter  estimates,  the median  t1/2  for  netupitant  was  calculated  as  88  hours.  None  of  the  covariates 
(body  mass  index  [BMI],  age,  gender,  race,  chemotherapy  regimen,  rescue  medication,  smoking  status, 
doxorubicin, epirubicin and flororuacil, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 
alkaline phosphatase, albumin, bilirubin, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]status and neutrophil 
count) had a significant impact on the disposition of netupitant. Metabolites M1 and M3 showed a large Vd and 
a  slower  elimination  compared  to  the  parent  compound  (CL  accounted  for  20%  and  30%  of  the  parent, 
respectively). A 3-compartment model was used to describe the concentration data of M2 due to the multiple 
exponential decay and flat elimination phase. The estimated parameters indicated that CL (1.24 L/hr) was 
approximately 6% of the parent. 
Palonosetron  estimates    from  the  population  PK  analysis  (NETU-10-02)were  consistent  with  a  previous 
analysis with regard to CL and Vd (median palonosetron CL was estimated to be 7.61 L/h; estimated median 
volume of the central compartment was 367 L). Palonosetron CL was influenced by creatinine clearance but 
this reduction (approximately 29%) would not result in a significant change in palonosetron exposure and 
would not necessitate a dosing reduction.  
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 56/153 
 
  
  
  
 
No specific studies were performed to evaluate netupitant in patients with renal impairment. In the ADME 
trial, less than 5% of all drug-related material was excreted in urine (NETU-09-21) and less than 1% of the 
netupitant dose was eliminated unchanged in the  urine (NETU-06-27) and therefore any accumulation of 
netupitant  or  metabolites  after  a  single  dose  would  be  negligible.  The  population  PK  study  showed  no 
correlation between PK parameters of netupitant and markers of renal dysfunction. In this study, patients 
with a reduced creatinine clearance (CLCR) also had a reduced palonosetron CL, but this reduction would not 
result in a significant change in palonosetron exposure (NETU-10-02).  
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
In NETU 10—10 maximum and total exposure of netupitant was increased in subjects with mild (Child Pugh 
5-6) , moderate  (Child Pugh 7-9) , and severe (Child Pugh 10-15)  hepatic impairment compared to matching 
healthy  subjects,  although  there  was  pronounced  individual  variability  in  both  hepatically-impaired  and 
healthy subjects. There were eight subjects in each in the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups with 
matching  controls  and only  2  with  severe  hepatic impairment.  Exposure  to  netupitant  (Cmax,  AUC0-t  and 
AUC0-∞) compared to matched healthy subjects was 11%, 28% and 19% higher in mild and 70%, 88% and 
143% higher in moderate hepatically-impaired subjects, respectively. PK parameter increases in the severe 
hepatically-impaired subjects were similar to the moderately- impaired group, however there were only 2 
subjects in this group so no conclusions can be drawn.  
Total  palonosetron  exposure  was  also  increased  in  subjects  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
compared to matched healthy subjects. In study NETU-10-10 exposure to palonosetron (Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞) compared to matched healthy subjects was 14%, 35% and 33% higher in mild and 1% lower, 60% 
and  62%  higher  in  moderate  hepatically-impaired  subjects,  respectively.  A  numerical  decrease  of 
palonosetron exposure was observed in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to matching 
healthy subjects, which was not statistically significant.  
The population PK study showed no correlation between PK parameters and markers of hepatic dysfunction 
including AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin .

Gender 
A pooled analysis using data from 3 Phase 1 single-dose studies (NETU-11-02, NETU-09-07 and NETU-11-23) 
in 153 healthy subjects was performed to evaluate a possible gender effect with netupitant and palonosetron 
(NEPA-13-11). 
A gender effect for palonosetron had previously been established, and data from the current analysis confirm 
that exposure (geometric mean) is higher (40% for AUC0-t, 31% for Cmax) in females. Palonosetron t 1/2 is also 
longer in females by approximately 16%. The clinical implications of the gender findings for palonosetron are 
of limited significance, as the safety margin is large (doses have been administered and well tolerated up 
through 12-fold the proposed oral dose) and the dose-response relationship has not been demonstrated to be 
closely linked to plasma concentrations, and as such, a difference in the range observed would not impact 
efficacy. 
For netupitant, females also had a higher exposure (geometric mean); there was a 35% increase for Cmax, a 
2% increase for AUC0-t and a 36% increase in t1/2 in females compared to males. For netupitant, these 
increases in exposure are not considered to be clinically relevant. The Tmax did not differ between the genders 
for  netupitant  and  palonosetron.  Furthermore,  in  the  population  PK  study,  gender  as  a  covariate  did  not 
influence the PK of netupitant, it`s metabolites, or palonosetron. 
A gender effect for palonosetron had previously been established during the development program, showing 
a 1.20-1.30 fold increase in exposure for females compared to males. In the pooled data from NEPA-13-11, 
mean palonosetron Cmax was approximately 1.30 fold higher and AUC was approximately 1.40 fold higher in 
females. T1/2 also was slightly longer (44 versus 37 hours), while Tmax was not different between males and 
females (NEPA-13-11). The population PK evaluation did not reveal gender as a significant covariate affecting 
the  disposition  of  palonosetron  in  patients  participating  in  NETU-08-18,  however  the  number  of  males 
participating was small (NETU-10-02). 
• 
Race 
In the population PK study population which comprised patients receiving MEC in Study NETU-08-18, there 
was  no  relationship  between  race  and  netupitant  or  palonosetron  exposure,  although  the  number  of 
non-caucasian patients was small (16 Asians) 
• 
Weight 
The effect of weight on exposure was investigated in a population PK study (Study NETU-10-02)). Neither 
body weight or BMI had a significant impact on the PK of netupitant. 
Body weight was found to contribute to inter-individual variability in V2 for palonosetron. Palonosetron has a 
large Vd with an estimated median V2 of 367 L for patients of median weight (71 kg), comparable to that 
observed in previous studies, indicative of extensive tissue distribution. Over the weight range observed for 
patients in this study (34 kg to 125 kg), V2 is calculated to vary from 257 L to 527 L. These results are 
consistent with a previously conducted population PK analysis for palonosetron. 
• 
Elderly 
In total 35 persons aged over 65 were included in PK studies all but four were aged under 75 years. There 
were two studies which specifically investigated PK in the over 65 population (NP 16600 and NETU 10-12)in 
addition  some  older  people  were  also  included  in  hepatic  insufficiency  study  (NETU  10-10),  and  the

interaction studies in cancer patiens NETU-10-09. No older people were included in the interaction studies 
with palonosetron, midazolam, erythromycin, digoxin, dexamethasone, ketaconazole, and rifampicin. 
Only two elderly participants were dosed in NP16600 therefore the results from this study are ignored. Twelve 
healthy older volunteers were evaluated in NETU-10-12 and compared to young healthy volunteers.  
Cmax and AUC0-∞ of netupitant showed a higher maximum plasma concentration in the elderly (mean Cmax 
880.8 μg/L)  compared to young healthy volunteers (mean Cmax 596 μg/L ) 
Exposure was also higher with mean AUC 0-∞ for the elderly population at 24739 h·μg/L compared to 20039 
h·μg/L in young healthy volunteers (see table).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
The  metabolism  of  netupitant  has  been  studied  in  vitro  in  human,  rat  and  dog  hepatocyte  incubations, 
microsomal incubations of human, rat, dog, minipig and marmoset liver, as well as with specific recombinant 
human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes.  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 59/153 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Human, rat, dog, minipig and marmoset liver microsomal incubations showed qualitatively similar metabolite 
patterns. The similarity in overall metabolism was confirmed by metabolite patterns from human, rat and dog 
hepatocyte incubations.  
Netupitant is metabolized by CYP3A4 to several metabolites. Three major oxidative metabolites of netupitant 
have  been  identified  after  hepatocytes  and  liver  microsomal  incubations:  M1  (RO0681133,  a  desmethyl 
derivative), M2 (RO0713001, a N-oxide derivative) and M3 (RO0731519, a OH-methyl derivative). 
CYP3A4, the major human liver CYP450 isoenzyme, catalyzed the oxidative metabolism of netupitant (but not 
CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP2C19). This isoenzyme is known to exhibit considerable variability (approximately 10 
fold) in the human population. It is also inducible, and can be inhibited by other drugs, indicating the potential 
for variability in the clearance of netupitant and for drug-drug interactions. 
In  human  liver  microsomes,  netupitant  competitively  inhibited  the  CYP3A4  mediated  hydroxylation  of 
testosterone  and  midazolam  (apparent  Ki  of  1.1  and  2.2  μM,  respectively).  Therefore,  interactions  of 
netupitant  with  drugs  mainly  metabolized  by  CYP3A4  cannot  be  excluded.  Additionally,  the  drug-drug 
interaction potential of metabolite M1 and metabolite M2 was investigated in vitro. M1 metabolite showed an 
inhibition potential similar to that of the parent drug (IC50 ~1.2 μM). 
For the hydroxylation of diclofenac, catalyzed by CYP2C9, the IC50 value of netupitant was approximately 20 
μM. Based on the low plasma concentration of netupitant expected in man, significant metabolic interactions 
with  CYP2C9  metabolized  drugs  are  considered  unlikely.  Other  CYP450  isoenzymes  (CYP1A2,  CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6) were not inhibited by netupitant (IC50 > 100 μM) (Report 1003907). 
From in vitro drug-drug-interaction studies focused on the inhibitory effect of netupitant on vincristine and 
cyclophosphamide metabolism in human liver microsomes, significant drug-drug interaction effects are not 
expected  in  humans  in  both  cases  (Cmax/K i<0.1  indicated  a  remote  possibility  of  in  vivo  drug-drug 
interaction)  (NETU-06-15,  NETU-09-10).  On  the  contrary  drug-drug  interaction  effects  are  possible  in 
humans  when  netupitant  is  co-administered  with  docetaxel:  the  IC50  value  of  netupitant  in  human  liver 
microsomes  was  3.7  μM  when  docetaxel  was  used  as  a  substrate.  An  estimation  of  the  C max/Ki  ratio  is 
approximately 0.5 (NETU-09-09). As presented below, a clinical study evaluating docetaxel was performed. 
Based on the results of in-vitro studies with P-glycoprotein (PgP), netupitant at 5 μM, modulates the Papp of 
3H-digoxin in both directions in a similar fashion to verapamil. Considering the low plasma concentration of 
netupitant  expected  in  human  plasma,  significant  metabolic  interactions  with  Pgp  transported  drugs  are 
considered  possible  only  for  supra-therapeutic  doses  (NETU-06-13).  A  clinical  study  with  digoxin  was 
performed for in vivo confirmation. 
Netupitant at concentrations of 0.2, 2 and 20 μM and M1, M2 and M3 at concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 μM 
did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 activity in human hepatocytes (NETU-10-27). 
In  vivo  drug-drug  interaction  between  netupitant  and  drugs  that  are  substrates  of  BCRP  is  considered 
possible because Cmax/IC50 ratio, calculated with Cmax (bound+unboud) in the range 0.73-1.3 μM ) and the 
IC50 determined in vesicular transfer inhibition assay, ranged between 0.12 and 0.21. However this result 
should be handled with caution, as the IC50 value could not be determined in MDCKII-BCRP inhibition assay 
due to the solubility limitation of 30 μM. Besides, at 10 μM there was no inhibition of the BCRP-mediated 
prazosin transport (NETU-12-81). 
In  vivo  interaction  of  netupitant  with  human  BSEP,  MRP2  efflux  transporters  and  with  human  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2 uptake transporters, are predicted to be unlikely.  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 60/153 
 
  
  
  
Based on the circulating Cmax concentrations (bound + unbound) of netupitant metabolites (ranging from 
0.07-0.11 μM, 0.17-0.35 μM and 0.07-0.16 μM for M1, M2 and M3, respectively) an in vivo interaction with 
all the transporters tested is predicted to be unlikely (NETU-12-81).  
In summary, netupitant is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak 
inhibitor of all other transport mechanisms evaluated. 
In vitro metabolism studies for palonosetron have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and 
CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are 
not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. 
There have been no in vitro animal studies or any in vivo studies of enzyme induction. There were no findings 
suggesting enzyme induction in any of the investigations.  
At high concentrations in vitro, palonosetron was a competitive inhibitor of some cytochrome isoforms but 
this is not considered likely to be clinically relevant. 
The  moderate  extent  of  plasma  protein  binding  suggests  that  small  changes  will  have  no  influence  on 
palonosetron availability. The absence of any evidence of enzyme induction and the fact that inhibition was 
only apparent at high concentrations in vitro suggests that interactions mediated by metabolic enzymes are 
unlikely. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions have not otherwise been investigated. 
• 
In vivo 
A  number  of  interaction  studies  were  conducted  with  netupitant  including:  the  following  cancer  drugs 
(docetaxel,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide);  palonosetron;  CYP3A4  substrates  (erythromycin, 
midazolam,  dexamethasone);  CVP3A4  inhibitors  and  inducers  (ketoconazole,  rifampicin);  and  P-gp 
substrates (digoxin) 
CYP3A4 Substrates  
Model  CYP3A4  substrates  erythromycin  and  midazolam  were  evaluated  when  administered  concomitantly 
with netupitant alone (NP16599). In this study, the pharmacokinetics of netupitant were not altered in the 
presence of erythromycin or midazolam. However, exposure of both substrates was increased (Cmax and AUC 
were  approximately  30%  higher  for  erythromycin  while  Cmax  and  AUC  were  40%  and  144%  higher  for 
midazolam).  
In  addition,  co-administration  of  the  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  with  the  CYP3A4  substrates 
ethinylestradiol  and  levonorgestrel,  was  evaluated  in  women  as  part  of  an  oral  contraceptive  regimen 
(NETU-10-08). Although the analysis of the effect of the oral contraceptives on netupitant was not part of the 
study  objectives,  the  data  were  reviewed  with  netupitant  PK  values  from  earlier  studies  (NETU-10-12; 
NETU-10-11; NETU-09-07; NETU-11-02), and indicated that there was no apparent effect of ethinylestradiol 
and levonorgestrel on netupitant.  
The netupitant/palonosetron FDC had no effect on Cmax and exposure (AUC0-∞) of ethinylestradiol. The 90% 
CI for AUC0-t (126.8%) fell just outside the upper limit of bioequivalence criteria indicating a slightly higher 
systemic  exposure  after  the  combination  compared  to  ethinylestradiol  alone.  For  the  levonorgesterel 
component, there was no effect of the FDC on levonorgestrel Cmax, while exposure parameters (AUC0-∞ and 
AUC0-t) were increased by approximately 40%, and the 90% CIs were outside bioequivalence range.  
EMA/236963/2015

Dexamethasone  
Dexamethasone is administered as a part of many chemotherapy regimens either to prevent nausea and 
vomiting or to prevent allergic reactions with medications such as Taxotere. In addition, dexamethasone is a 
known CYP3A4 substrate. A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of netupitant (at three different 
doses) on dexamethasone, using a dexamethasone regimen similar to that used in some antiemetic regimens 
for the prevention of CINV (NETU-06-07).  
The mean plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were higher when dexamethasone was co-administered 
with netupitant. The increase appeared to be dependent on netupitant exposure. AUC0-24 was increased 1.5, 
1.7 and 1.8 fold with co-administration of 100, 300 and 450 mg, respectively. Exposure increased further 
after multiple doses: AUC84-∞ was 1.7, 2.4 and 2.7-fold higher, respectively, after co-administration with 
netupitant. 
CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  
Administration  of  the  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  with  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  increased  the 
exposure of netupitant and resulted in a Cmax of 1.3 fold, AUC0-∞ of 2.4 fold and AUC0-tz of 1.8 fold, when 
compared to the administration of netupitant/palonosetron FDC alone. The formation of M1 and M3 was also 
affected when netupitant was co-administered with ketoconazole compared to the intake of netupitant alone. 
Cmax and AUC0-tz were lower for all three metabolites after co-administration of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole 
did not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron (NETU-10-11).  
Administration  of  the  CYP3A4  inducer  rifampicin  with  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  alone  decreased  the 
exposure of netupitant. Cmax, AUC0-∞ and AUC0-tz 2.6, 5.9, and 5.5 fold, respectively. Co-administration of 
rifampicin resulted in a non significant decrease in palonosetron exposure (NETU-10-11). 
Because in vitro studies showed that netupitant interacted with P-gp resulting in a concentration-dependent 
modulation of 3H-digoxin transport, a clinical study was conducted to test the clinical relevance of the in vitro 
observations. The PK of digoxin was similar in the presence and absence of netupitant in healthy volunteers 
(NETU-07-01).  
Considering overall the in vitro interaction studies of netupitant and its three metabolites (M1, M2 and M3) 
with human BSEP, MRP2 and MDR1 efflux transporters and with human OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT1 and OCT2 uptake transporters, in vivo drug-drug interactions are predicted to be unlikely.  
Netupitant in vivo drug-drug interaction with BCRP might be considered possible because Cmax/IC50 ratio, 
calculated with the IC50 determined in VT assay, ranges between 0.12 and 0.2. The IC50 value could not be 
determined in MDCKII-BCRP inhibition assay due to the solubility limitation of 30 μM and that at 10 μM there 
was not inhibition of the BCRP-mediated prazosin transport (NETU-12-81). 
Agents Prescribed Together or Likely to be Coadministered  
Palonosetron 
Since netupitant and palonosetron are to be co-administered in the FDC, the possible PK interaction between 
the highest doses used in Phase 2 trials was evaluated in a PK study (netupitant 450 mg and palonosetron 
0.75 mg) (NETU-06-27). The study showed that there was no effect of palonosetron on netupitant exposure 
and although palonosetron Cmax  was slightly higher in the presence of  netupitant, no significant effect  of 
netupitant on palonosetron exposure was demonstrated.  
Chemotherapy Agents  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 62/153 
 
  
  
  
Study  NETU-10-09  evaluated  the  pharmacokinetics  of  3  common  chemotherapy  agents  (docetaxel, 
etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide)  likely  to  be  used in  conjunction  with  the  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC; 
docetaxel  and  etoposide  are  also  known  CYP3A4  substrates  while  cyclophosphamide  is  metabolized  by  a 
number of CYP enzymes, including 3A4.  
The  study  showed  that  concentrations  of  docetaxel  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  etoposide,  were  consistently 
elevated  in  patients  who  received  the  FDC  compared  to  those  who  received  palonosetron  only.  Mean 
exposure (AUC0-t) increases were 37% and 21% for docetaxel and etoposide, respectively, in the netupitant 
test period. Cyclophosphamide concentrations were not consistently affected and showed wide variability. 
Although  concentrations  of  chemotherapy  were  elevated  following  netupitant  administration,  AE  profiles 
were  not  different  in  the  two  study  groups,  indicating  that  there  was  no  clinical  impact  of  the  higher 
chemotherapy concentrations in these patients.  
There were no differences in the disposition of netupitant or its metabolites with any of the chemotherapeutic 
agents.  PK  parameters  were  consistent  with  previous  values  observed  in  healthy  volunteer  trials. 
Palonosetron  mean  exposure  (AUC0-∞)  was  higher  (65%)  and  the  mean  half-life  was  20  h  longer  in  the 
docetaxel group compared to the etoposide and cyclophosphamide groups. No dose adjustment is necessary, 
given the large safety margin for palonosetron.  
In addition, the population PK analysis evaluated doxorubicin, epirubicin, fluorouracil and rescue medication 
as  potential  covariates  that  could  influence  the  disposition  of  netupitant  and/or  palonosetron.  In  this 
population,  none  were  found  to  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  disposition  of  netupitant  or  palonosetron 
(NETU-10-02). Other moderately emetogenic chemotherapy agents that are metabolised by CYP3A4 were 
not investigated for their potential to interact with netupitant e.g. vinorelbine, irinotecan, and imatinib. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Three  specific  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  part  of  this  product  development  program.  Two  studies 
evaluated netupitant alone, and the third (Thorough QT/QTc study) evaluated the netupitant-palonosetron 
FDC. In addition, a Phase 2 study, NETU-07-07 lead to the choice of the 300 mg netupitant dose for Phase 3 
and a population PK/PD analysis was performed in conjunction with Study NETU-08-18 (NETU-10-02).   
Mechanism of action 
Netupitant is a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.  
Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no 
affinity for other receptors. Chemotherapeutic substances produce nausea and vomiting by stimulating the 
release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 
receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. The development of acute emesis is known 
to depend on serotonin and its 5-HT3 receptors have been demonstrated to selectively stimulate the emetic 
response.  
Delayed  emesis  has  been  largely  associated  with  the  activation  of  tachykinin  family  neurokinin  1  (NK1) 
receptors (broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by substance P. As shown in in 
vitro and in vivo studies, netupitant inhibits substance P mediated responses.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Two  studies  were  submitted  to  demonstrate  the  primary  pharmacology.  In  addition  supportive  data  was 
provided by the Population Study NETU-08-18 (NETU-10-02)   
NP16602:  Apomorphine  challenge  in  healthy  volunteers  was  undertaken  as  a  pharmacodynamic  efficacy 
study. This was a randomised double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the anti-emetic effect of netupitant 
following an apomorphine challenge in healthy volunteers in which 32 subjects were randomly to 4 dosing 
groups (within each group 6 subjects received netupitant and 2 placebo). Another study in healthy volunteers 
(NETU-06-08) was undertaken to assess the degree of Neurokinin-1 receptor occupancy in the human brain 
after a single dose of netupitant in healthy male subjects.

Emesis occurring during the 90-minute period following apomorphine injection was evaluated by the degree 
of nausea, measured at 10 minute intervals using a visual analogue scale, the occurrence of vomiting and the 
total number of vomits and retches.  
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-dose and at 15 and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 
5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h post-dose. Blood and urine samples for laboratory safety 
tests were taken at screening, pre-dose, at 24, 72 and 168 h post-dose, and at follow-up (day 9-15). Vital 
signs were recorded at screening, pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 129, 144 and 168 h post-dose, 
and at follow-up. 12-lead ECG recordings were performed at screening, pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 
168 h post-dose and at follow-up. 
Analysis of the results by plasma netupitant concentration at the time of apomorphine challenge showed a 
decrease  in  the  incidence  of  vomiting  with  increasing  netupitant  levels.  No  subject  in  the  highest 
concentration group (> 300 ng/mL, corresponding to 1 subject taking 300 mg and 5 subjects taking 450 mg) 
experienced vomiting, a statistically significant result compared to placebo (p = 0.010).  
Subjects with lower netupitant concentrations also experienced less vomiting than the placebo group. In the 
three  groups  with  lower  netupitant  concentrations,  50%  of  subjects  experienced  no  vomiting  (N=18), 
compared with 25% of subjects vomiting-free in the placebo group (N=8). In total, 15 out of the 24 subjects 
who received netupitant experienced no vomiting, with six subjects having fewer than 6 vomiting episodes. 
Only 2 of the 8 subjects receiving placebo experienced less than 6 vomiting episodes.  
Retching was reduced in subjects treated with active drug, but no trend was observed between concentration 
groups. The results were skewed by one subject in the highest concentration group, who experienced a very

high number of retches. Nausea tended to increase with netupitant concentration, with the exception of the 
lowest concentration group (≤50 ng/mL), which recorded the lowest levels.

NETU-06-08 was undertaken to assess the degree of Neurokinin-1 receptor occupancy in the human brain 
after a single dose of netupitant in healthy male subjects 
This was  a single dose, randomised, open-label, PET study investigating the degree of occupancy of NK1 
receptors in the human brain after single oral doses of netupitant in healthy male subjects. Subjects were 
randomised to a single dose of 100, 300 or 450 mg. 
The study consisted of a screening visit, a baseline PET visit, a treatment period with up to 5 post dose PET 
scans  and  a  follow-up  visit.  The  screening  assessments  were  performed  within  28  days  before  dose 
administration,  the  baseline  PET  visit  was  performed  within  7  days  before  dose  administration  and  the 
follow-up visit was performed 14 ±2 days after dose administration.  
PET scans were performed 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after dose administration. 
8 healthy white males aged between 20 to 25 years were randomised, 6 completed the study. Two subjects 
were withdrawn because the baseline PET scans were lost. These 2 subjects were replaced by two further 
subjects. Two of the eight were not treated (no reason given).  
The results of this investigation demonstrated that netupitant is a potent selective NK1 receptor antagonist in 
the human brain with an ability to block NK1 receptors in the human brain for a relatively long time. The 
anticipated  high  NK1-RO  (90%  or  higher)  close  to  expected  Cmax  (6  hours  post  dose)  was  achieved  for 
occipital  cortex  and  frontal  cortex  for  all  investigated  doses  as  well  as  for  striatum  (for  300  and  450  mg 
netupitant) and anterior cingulate (for 100 and 450 mg netupitant).  
All doses showed a relatively long duration of blockade of the NK1 receptors and for most regions the NK1-RO 
declined slowly until 96 hours post dose in a dose-dependent fashion. In the 100 mg dose group, 4 of 6 
regions still had a mean NK1-RO over 70% at 96 hours post dose. In the highest dose group (450 mg), 5 of 
6 regions had a mean NK1-RO near to 80% or higher at 96 hours post dose. A comparison of the results for 
the  dose  groups  (100  mg,  300  mg  and  450  mg)  showed  a  general  but  low  increase  in  NK1-ROs  with 
increasing dose. (Figure 3).

Average  Neurokinin  1  Receptor  Occupancy  (NK1-RO),  Obtained  for  Three  Dose

300 and 450 mg Netupitant (N=2 for each dose) in Striatum and Occipital Cortex. 
A  clear  relationship  was  observed  between  degree  of  NK1-RO  in  striatum  and  plasma  concentrations  of 
netupitant (Figure 4). Based on the PK/PD parameter estimates, a netupitant plasma concentration of 225 
μg/L  corresponds  to  NK1  receptor  occupancy  of  90%  in  striatum.  A  good  fit  of  the  predicted  PK-PD 
relationship was obtained and the EC50 determined for striatum was 10.2 μg/L (CV: 14.5%). In contrast the 
other considered brain regions showed a more narrow range of NK1-RO and therefore the EC50 values for the 
cortex areas could only be estimated with low precision.

The PK parameters (Cmax and Tmax) were comparable to those obtained in previous single dose studies. 
Population PD Analysis in Phase 3  
During the population PK analysis carried out using data from the Phase 3 trial NETU-08-18 (NETU-10-02) in 
cancer patients treated with the FDC 300 mg/0.5mg, the relationship between concentrations of netupitant 
and its metabolites as well as palonosetron, and efficacy measures was investigated graphically. Measures of 
exposure (predicted CL, AUCinf, and Cmax) for netupitant, M1, M2, and M3, and palonosetron were correlated 
with measures of efficacy variables (complete response) at cycle 1.  
Complete  Response  in  the  delayed,  acute  and  overall  phases  were  assessed  via  a  graphical  exploratory 
approach  to  visually  determine  if  any  correlations  between  drug  exposures  and  these  parameters  were 
evident. 
A  clear  relationship  between  exposure  and  response  was  not  observed,  demonstrating  that  effective 
concentrations of netupitant were achieved (NETU-10-02).

Secondary pharmacology 
One safety study was conducted NETU-07-20: thorough QT study in health volunteers. 
A  Double-Blind  Randomised  Parallel-Group  Trial 
to 
Investigate  Possible  ECG  Effects  of 
Netupitant/Palonosetron Using a Clinical and a Supratherapeutic Dose Compared to Placebo and Moxifloxacin 
(A Positive Control) in Healthy Men and Women: A Thorough ECG Trial. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the administration of netupitant in combination 
with palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval more than placebo in male and female healthy subjects. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the general safety and tolerability of netupitant in combination with 
palonosetron as well as the relative safety in comparison with moxifloxacin with focus on ECG parameters in 
healthy subjects and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of netupitant (and its metabolites M1, M2, and M3) 
and palonosetron (and its metabolites M4 and M9) in plasma. 
The  study  was  a  randomised,  double-blind  (except  for  the  moxifloxacin  active  control),  double-dummy, 
parallel-group, placebo and open-label positive-controlled study design involving four study groups: placebo; 
netupitant with palonosetron (200 mg + 0.50 mg); netupitant with palonosetron (600 mg + 1.50 mg); and 
moxifloxacin (400 mg). The study was carried out in one treatment period of three days with administration 
of study drug on Day 1.  
Two-hundred (200) healthy subjects (106 men and 94 women) participated in the treatment phase of the 
study.  Men  and  women  were  included  to  reflect  the  target  population  for  the  therapy  with  netupitant.  A 
centralized  ECG  reading  lab  was  used  to  read  the  ECGs  with  interpretation  by  a  high-resolution 
semi-automatic on-screen caliper method with annotations to minimize inter-reader variability. The central 
ECG laboratory was blinded to subjects and their treatment.  
All treatments included a 24 h baseline and then all the subjects received a single dose of treatment, followed 
by ECG and pharmacokinetic measurements for 2 days. 
The results of this ECG trial showed no signal of any effect on AV conduction or cardiac depolarization as 
measured by the PR and QRS interval durations. There was a non-dose related reduction in heart rate of 3 
bpm in the palonosetron/netupitant groups of questionable clinical importance. There were no new clinically 
relevant morphological changes.  
The effect of netupitant/palonosetron on cardiac repolarization using all of the QTc interval formulas shows no 
signal  of  relevant  change.  Figure  5  below  shows  the  Change  in  QtcI  (delta-delta)  versus  time  for 
palonosetron/netupitant combinations and the positive control, moxifloxacin.

PK Results  
The  extent  of  absorption  (AUC)  for  netupitant  was  proportional  to  the  dose  administered  with  a  dose 
proportional increase of the geometric mean AUC of 4079 h*μg/L at 200 mg to 12213 h*μg/L at 600 mg oral 
dose. For Cmax the same dose proportionality was observed with 219 μg/L at 200 mg and 648 μg/L at 600 mg 
dose. The inter subject variability of netupitant pharmacokinetics is high with a variability of 42% and 48% 
for AUC and Cmax at 200 mg and 47% and 56% for AUC and Cmax at 600 mg dose.  
For palonosetron a dose proportional increase was observed for AUC (22641 h*ng/L at 0.5 mg to 67918 
h*ng/L at 1.5 mg) and for Cmax (822 ng/L to 2588 ng/L). The inter subject variability of palonosetron is lower 
as compared to netupitant with a variability of 25% and 29% for AUC and Cmax at 0.5 mg and 20% and 23% 
for AUC and Cmax at 1.5 mg dose.  
The pharmacokinetics of netupitant and metabolites and palonosetron and metabolites confirmed that the 
time points of Holter 12-lead ECG at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 23.5, 30, 36, 42, and 47.5 hours 
post dose were adequately chosen since the Cmax of all analytes lie within the ECG measurement time points. 
• 
PK/PD Modeling  
The PK/PD modeling indicated there was no relationship between changes in QTcI and plasma concentration 
of either palonosetron or netupitant. 
During  the  population  PK  analysis  (NETU-10-02)  in  MEC  patients  participating  in  trial  NETU-08-18,  the 
relationship between concentrations of netupitant, its metabolites as well as palonosetron, and efficacy and 
safety  measures  was  investigated  graphically.  Measures  of  exposure  (predicted  CL,  AUCinf,  and  Cmax)  for 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 70/153 
 
  
  
  
 
netupitant, M1, M2, and M3, and palonosetron were correlated with measures of cardiac safety (changes from 
baseline in troponin levels on Days 2 and 6).  
The  plots  demonstrate  that  there  was  no  overt  relationship  or  trend  between  exposure  parameters  for 
netupitant, its metabolites, and palonosetron and safety, as measured by troponin levels (NETU-10-02). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall measurable plasma netupitant concentrations were detected between 15 minutes and 3 hours after 
dosing in single dose oral studies. After this lag time, plasma concentrations followed a first order absorption 
process  and  reached  Cmax  in  approximately  4-5  hours.  Netupitant  is  eliminated  from  the  body  in  a 
multi-exponential fashion, with an apparent mean elimination half-life ranging from 30 to approximately 100 
hours (across all studies for doses of 30 mg to 450 mg) with a few longer outliers. Netupitant is not dose 
proportional in doses from 10 to 300mg but Dose proportionality has been demonstrated for the 300mg to 
450 mg doses. 
No absolute studies on bioavailability with netupitant were carried out but it is estimated based on two IV 
studies with netupitant that the oral preparation has a greater than 60% bioavailability. Netupitant is highly 
protein bound. The mean volume of distribution in humans ranged from approximately 850L to over 2000L 
indicating substantial distribution of netupitant into the tissues. 
Netupitant is metabolised in the liver and is primarily excreted excreted via the hepatic/biliary routes, with 
renal clearance (CLr) accounting for less than 5% of CL. In early studies, 3 active metabolites were identified 
(M1, M2 and M3). In plasma from humans who were administered oral netupitant, netupitant and its 3 major 
metabolites were extensively bound (> 97%) to plasma protein at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1500 
ng/mL. Based on a gerbil foot tapping NK1 assay these metabolites appear to be pharmacologically active. 
After one week daily dosing in healthy volunteers a greater than three times exposure to netupitant was 
shown. Given that this FDC is intended for single administration with each chemotherapy cycle subsequent 
administration can be assumed to be often separated by a 3 week interval to assure a complete washout from 
the previous administration. With a half-life of netupitant, active metabolites M1, M2, M3 and palonosetron 
averaging  between  approximately  40  and  80  h,  at  the  start  of  a  new  chemotherapy  cycle  at  least  6.3 
half-lives would have elapsed and approximately 99% of the dose would have been eliminated before the 
next dose. Even in patients who underwent chemotherapy every 2 weeks (e.g., study NETU-10-29), at the 
start of a new chemotherapy cycle approximately 95% of the dose would have been eliminated prior to the 
next dose in 4.2 half-lives, allowing for clinically insignificant accumulation. 
In an earlier study (n =11) investigating the effect of food netupitant alone showed a marked increase on 
exposure and Cmax in the fed state whereas in a more recent study (n=22) exposing subjects to the FDC only 
a slight increase in exposure and Cmax of netupitant in the fed states was shown. Given that the latter study 
was  conducted  with  a  larger  population  and  with  the  FDC  the  results  from  this  study  are  given  greater 
emphasis. As the differences in PK with the FDC combination were marginal the FDC can be given with or 
without food. 
The PK in the target population is similar to that in healthy volunteers though greater inter-subject variability 
was demonstrated in the cancer chemotherapy population. Inter-subject variability in the fed state for the 
EMA/236963/2015

proposed netupitant dose is moderate, and high in the fasted state, in those with hepatic impairment, the 
elderly and those taking netupitant with etoposide.  
There is a gender effect for both palonosetron and netupitant with higher exposure and Cmax for palonosetron 
in females and higher Cmax for netupitant not deflected in a greater incidence of adverse events in females 
compared to males. Exposure and Cmaxare also higher in older people in whom exposure to netupitant and 
palansetron  increased  by  25%  and  37%  respectively  and  Cmax  by  10%  and  36%  respectively.  These 
differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and so no dose adjustments are indicated in elderly subjects. 
Nevertheless all but four of the older people exposed to the FDC were aged under 75 therefore there is limited 
exposure of the older old (> 75 years) to the FDC in PK studies.  
As netupitant and palonosetron in the FDC showed increased exposure in older people in general it is possible 
that exposure with the same dose is greater in patients > 75 years. Therefore a precautionary statement to 
this age population was included in section 4.2 of the SmPC and the RMP reflects experience in patients aged 
75 years and more as missing information. 
No  studies  were  carried  out  with  the  FDC  on  subjects  with  renal  impairment.  This  was  justified  by  the 
applicant  on  the  basis  that  renal  clearance  accounts  for  only  5%  of  CL  and  a  population  PK/PD  study 
NETU-10-02 (which included 118 subjects from the phase 111 study NETU-08-18) did not demonstrate any 
influence of renal impairment on PK therefore the FDC can be administered without dose adjustion. However 
no  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  were  included  in  this  study.  As  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn 
regarding dosing in patients with severe renal impairment the SmPC states that the use in these patients 
should be avoided. 
Overall, increases in exposure of netupitant and palonosetron in the FDC were observed in subjects with 
hepatic impairment presumably due to reduced hepatic metabolism. Exposure and C max increased by 70% to 
143% patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Although the increases were statistically significant, they 
are of questionable clinical significance and variability in the healthy control groups was large and renders the 
comparisons  difficult  to  interpret.  Safety  data  in  the  hepatic  impairment  study  showed  no  differences 
between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects with respect to safety profile and no dose 
reduction  are  indicated.  Considering  that  each  dose  is  given  as  a  once  off  before  chemotherapy  this  is 
acceptable. Furthermore modelling of accumulation has demonstrated minimal accumulation of netupitant 
with 300mg administered at 3 or 2 weekly intervals. Given the lack of evidence for significant accumulation 
of netupitant with 2 or 3 weekly dosing, and the tolerance of higher exposure levels, no dose adjustment for 
moderate hepatic impairment is required.  
Limited  conclusions  can  be  drawn  however  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  due  to  the  low 
number of subjects included in this group. Therefore a cautionary statement on increased exposure and on 
the limited data available in severe hepatic impairment was included in section 4.4. of the SmPC.  
Netupitant is primarily metabolized via hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4. In general, genetic polymorphism of 
CYP3A4 results in a decrease in enzyme activity, but occurs in a small proportion of the population across all 
of the affected alleles. Specific studies to evaluate effect of genetic polymorphism of CYP3A4 on netupitant 
disposition were not conducted but considering that even a remarkable reduction of the CYP3A4 enzymatic 
activity  such  as  that  occurred  when  a  strong  CY3A4  inhibitor  is  co-administered  with  netupitant,  is  not 
expected  to  increase  netupitant  exposure  more  than  approximately  2-fold  and  the  large  safety  margin 
established for netupitant in the clinical program this is acceptable. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 72/153 
 
  
  
  
CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) increased the AUC of netupitant 1.8 fold, whereas CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin 
as  expected  decreased  the  AUC  to  netupitant  considerably  (5.2  fold).  This  information  is  appropriately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Netupitant increased exposure to other CYP3A4 substrates e.g erythromycin, midazolam, levonorgestrel and 
dexamethasone  therefore  it  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  receiving  concomitant  orally 
anministered  active  substances  that  are  metabolized  through  this  enzyme  as  labelled  in  the  SmPC. 
Co-administration of a single dose of 300mg netupitant with dexamethasone led to a significant increase in 
dexamethasone exposure in a time and dose related manner. The AUC0-24 (Day 1), the AUC24-36 (Day 2) and 
the AUC84-108 and AUC84-∞ (Day 4) of dexamethasone increased 2.4-fold, with co-administration of 300 mg 
netupitant. Therefore recommended oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % 
when co-administered with Akynzeo as stated in the SmPC. Dexamethasone, midazolam and erythromycin 
had no effect on netupitant levels. 
Based  on  development  program,  the  potential  for  netupitant  interaction  with  chemotherapy  agents 
metabolized  by  CYP3A4  was  considered,  and  three  in  vitro  studies  were  conducted  with  vincristine, 
cyclophosphamide and docetaxel as representative chemotherapeutic agents known to be metabolized by 
CYP3A4. These in vitro results were investigated in cancer patients (NETU-10-09) and an increase of AUC0-t 
values was reported for each chemotherapeutic agent when Akynzeo was concomitantly administered, as 
compared to other antiemetic treatments (palonosetron). On average, the exposure increased 1.35-fold for 
docetaxel, 1.28-fold for etoposide and 1.20-fold for cyclophosphamide. Therefore precautionary statements 
on chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for CYP3A4 were included in the SmPC. 
The potential of netupitant and its three main metabolites M1, M2 and M3 to inhibit UGT enzymes in both 
pooled human liver microsomes and a panel of cDNA expressed recombinant human UGT enzymes showed 
that in vivo interaction upon netupitant administration is possible at intestinal level during the absorption 
phase of orally administered drugs with poor/moderate oral bioavailability (F% < 50%) which are mainly 
metabolized by UGT2B7. Whereas the magnitude of such an effect in the clinical setting is not established a 
cautionary statement on this possible interaction was added to the SmPC and it was added to the RMP as a 
potential risk. 
BCRP  and  P-gp  are  both  inhibited  in  vitro  by  netupitant  with  similar  IC50  values,  i.e.,  6  and  3  μM, 
respectively. Since in vitro data show that netupitant inhibits BCRP, and, even though clinical adverse events 
related to BCRP inhibition are rare, information on inhibition of the efflux transporter BCRP was included in 
the SmPC.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Two pharmacodynamic studies were performed one in which volunteers were exposed to doses ranging from 
100mg to 450mg of netupitant between 8 to 12 hours prior to an apomorphine injection.  A decrease in the 
incidence of vomiting was noted with increasing netupitant levels. No subject in the highest concentration 
group (> 300 ng/mL, corresponding to 1 subject taking 300 mg and 5 subjects taking 450 mg) experienced 
vomiting, a statistically significant result compared to placebo (p = 0.010). However nausea appeared to 
increase  with  increasing  exposure.  A  PET  study  demonstrated  that  netupitant  is  a  potent  selective  NK1 
receptor antagonist in the human brain with an ability to block NK1 receptors for a relatively long time. In the 
population PD analysis a clear relationship was not demonstrated between exposure and response. However 
there was a correlation between Clearance/F and response. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 73/153 
 
  
  
  
 
Overall there is evidence from pharmacodynamic studies for the efficacy of the FDC and netupitant.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK and PD of netupitant and the FDC has been sufficiently characterised. Posology and relevant 
interactions are appropriately reflected in the product information.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant has presented reports for 3 efficacy clinical studies. 2 of these (NETU-07-07 & NETU -08-18) 
were designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the combination in the setting of single cycle HEC 
and single and multiple cycle MEC respectively. PALO-10-01 was designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of 
oral vs. I.V. palonosetron in the setting of HEC.  
Study NETU-10-29 was primarily designed to evaluate the safety of the FDC in both HEC and MEC settings, 
and will be dealt with in the clinical safety section of this report. Efficacy endpoints were secondary objectives 
in this study.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Early  studies  evaluated  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  netupitant  using  an  apomorphine  challenge  model 
(NP16602) followed by an NK1 receptor binding assay (PET study; NETU-06-08). These two studies led to an 
understanding  that  the  therapeutic  dose  in  humans  was  likely  to  be  in  the  100-300  mg  dose  range. 
Subsequently, Phase 2 study NETU-07-07 was designed to test 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg netupitant with 
palonosetron  0.50  mg  against  palonosetron  0.50  mg  alone.  Results  led  to  selection  of  the 
netupitant/palonosetron 300 mg/0.50 mg combination dose used in Phase 3 trials. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
NETU-07-07: 
A  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Parallel  Group,  Dose-Ranging,  Multicenter  Study  assessing  the  Effect  of 
Different  Doses  of  Netupitant  or  Placebo  Administered  with  Palonosetron  and  Dexamethasone  on  the 
Prevention of Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Cancer Patients 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study population consisted of adult (≥ 18 years of age) chemotherapy naïve male or female patients with 
histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  solid  tumours  who  were  scheduled  to  receive  highly  emetogenic 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky index ≥ 70% and to be able to 
understand  and  follow  study  procedures  and  complete  the  patient  diary.  Female  patients  of  childbearing 
potential  were  required  to  have  a  negative  pregnancy  test  at  screening  and  to  practice  concurrently  two 
reliable methods of contraception during the study. 
Patients could not participate in the study if they were currently using illicit drugs or abusing alcohol, were 
scheduled  to  receive  moderately  or  highly  emetogenic  chemotherapy  from  Day  2  to  5  following  cisplatin 
administration,  received  (within  1  week  prior  to  Day  1)  or  were  scheduled  to  receive  (Days  1  to  5  after 
cisplatin  administration)  moderately  or  highly  emetogenic  radiotherapy,  took  any  drug  with  potential 
antiemetic efficacy within 24 hours prior to Day 1, took systemic corticosteroids within 72 hours prior to Day 
1, or took NK1 receptor antagonists or any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, or had other 
medical  conditions  or  personal  circumstances  that  would  interfere  with  interpretation  of  study  results  or 
expose the patient to an unacceptable risk. 
Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomised (stratified by gender) to one of the following treatment groups: 
Group 1 –  0.5 mg oral palonosetron on Day 1 (with dexamethasone standard regimen: 20mg on Day 1 and 
8 mg BID from Day 2 to Day 4) 
Group 2 –  100 mg oral netupitant and 0.5 mg oral palonosetron on Day 1 (with dexamethasone adjusted 
regimen: 12 mg on Day 1 and 8 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 4) 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 76/153 
 
  
  
  
 
Group 3 –  200 mg oral netupitant and 0.5 mg oral palonosetron on Day 1 (with dexamethasone adjusted 
regimen: 12 mg on Day 1 and 8 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 4) 
Group 4 –  300 mg oral netupitant and 0.5 mg oral palonosetron on Day 1 (with dexamethasone adjusted 
regimen: 12 mg on Day 1 and 8 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 4) 
Group 5 –  125 mg (on Day 1) and 80 mg daily (for the following two days) oral aprepitant and 32 mg IV 
ondansetron (with dexamethasone adjusted regimen: 12 mg on Day 1 and 8 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 4) 
Group 5, consisting of a combination of a licensed NK-1 RA, a 5HT-3 RA and dexamethasone was added as an 
exploratory arm reflecting current practice regarding these agents. 
Preliminary  results  of  a  drug-drug  interaction  study  indicated  that  a  clinically  relevant  increase  in 
dexamethasone  exposure  occurred  when  it  is  administered  with  netupitant.  Therefore,  the  standard 
dexamethasone regimen was reduced proportionally to balance dexamethasone exposure across all study 
arms. The adjusted regimen was the same as for aprepitant. 
Objectives 
The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of three single oral doses of netupitant 
combined  with  palonosetron  and  dexamethasone  to  palonosetron  and  dexamethasone  alone  in  the 
prevention of highly emetogenic chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  outcome  was  complete  response  rate  at  120h  (overall)  following  initiation  of  Cycle  1 
chemotherapy regimen. Complete response was defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication. 
Secondary outcome measures included; 
•  CR at 0-24h (acute phase) and 25-120h (delayed phase), 
•  Complete protection, defined as no emesis, no rescue medication, and no significant nausea (defined 
as <25mm on VAS) 
• 
Total control, as above with no nausea (defined as <5mm on VAS) 
•  No nausea 
•  No significant nausea 
•  No rescue medication 
•  No emesis, 
These were evaluated during the acute (0-24h), delayed (25-120h) and overall (0-120h) phases. They were 
also evaluated for each 24h subset during the total evaluation period. 
Other secondary endpoints were; 
• 
• 
• 
Time to 1st emetic episode 
Time to rescue medication 
Time to treatment failure ( defined as time to emetic episode or rescue medication) 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 77/153 
 
  
  
  
•  Severity of nausea as measured by VAS in each 24h period 
• 
Patient global satisfaction with anti-emetic medication as measured by VAS in each 24jh period 
Safety  assessments  included  physical  examinations,  12-lead  ECGs,  vital  signs,  haematology,  blood 
chemistry, urinalysis, and adverse events. 
Sample size 
The sample size was estimated to be 680 patients, distributed across five treatment groups (136 patients per 
group).  The  assumption  was  a  responder  rate  of  70%  in  the  netupitant  and  palonosetron  group  (plus 
dexamethasone regimen) and 50% in the palonosetron alone group (plus dexamethasone regimen). For a 
one-sided test of difference, using α=0.0166 (obtained as type I error divided by the number of comparisons 
= 0.050/ 3), a sample size of 129 evaluable patients per group was needed to ensure 85% power for each 
comparison. The number was rounded up to 136 patients per treatment group. 
Randomisation 
Patients were assigned to treatment groups using a randomisationlist that was stratified by gender. Within 
strata (gender), patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to one of five treatment 
groups in a balanced design (i.e., in the ratio 1:1:1:1:1). 
A randomisationlist was prepared prior to the start of the study. According to this randomisationlist, sealed 
cartons  containing  the  study  drug  and  additional  study  drug  were  supplied  to  the  investigational  sites. 
Patients  were  randomised  by  the  investigator  using  an  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS)  in 
accordance with study-specific procedures. 
A  dynamic  adaptive  stratification  type  of  randomisation  method  that  balanced  the  five  treatment  groups 
according to the patient gender was used. Treatments were balanced across the entire study, not within each 
individual site. 
The general strategy of this randomisation was to give additional probability to receiving a specific treatment 
if it was  underrepresented in the  current randomisation status.  Patients  who  were  randomised  but  never 
received  study  treatment  were  not  considered  during  the  following  patient  randomisation/treatment 
assignment.  This  ensured  that  a  balance  among  treatment  groups  in  the  treated  population  was  being 
maintained.  The  investigator  was  trained  to  immediately  notify  the  IVRS  if  a  randomised  patient  did  not 
receive study treatment. The relevant algorithm to this method tailored for this study was described in the 
appropriate IVRS document. 
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain study blinding, matching placebos were manufactured for each of the study drugs and additional 
study drug. 
Statistical methods 
The primary study objective was to find out whether or not at least one of three doses of netupitant combined 
with palonosetron was more effective than palonosetron alone based on the complete response rate at 0-120 
hours (CR 0-120). 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 78/153 
 
  
  
  
Therefore, the primary statistical analysis of efficacy was designed to reject the composite null hypothesis 
that none of the three combinations of the active netupitant dose combined with palonosetron was more 
effective than palonosetron alone. The Holm-Bonferroni method was used to control for the type I error. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the complete response during 0-120 hours.  
The complete response rate during 0-120 hours was summarized by treatment arm. The number and the 
proportion of the patients with CR 0-120 were presented in a frequency table. 
For the response rate and for the difference in response rate between each palonosetron plus netupitant dose 
group and palonosetron alone group, the 95% CI were provided. Pairwise comparisons between palonosetron 
plus netupitant dose group and palonosetron alone group were performed using Chi-square test. 
The main question of the study was whether or not the null-hypothesis (H0) that none of the regimens of 
netupitant combined with palonosetron was superior to the oral palonosetron alone (0.5 mg) can be rejected 
in favour of the alternative hypothesis that at least one dose of oral netupitant and palonosetron was superior 
to oral palonosetron alone (0.5 mg), considering the complete response rate at 0-120 hours. The primary test 
was performed using a logistic regression adjusted for the covariate (gender), where each dose of netupitant 
combined with a fixed dose of palonosetron and dexamethasone was compared to palonosetron alone and 
dexamethasone.  In  order  to  test  the  null  hypothesis,  three  one-sided  tests  were  conducted  with  three 
separate null hypotheses: Hi (i=1, 2, 3) with the corresponding p-values pi that stated the linear coefficient 
that corresponds to the i-th active treatment in the logistic regression model was not positive. The general 
null-hypothesis, therefore, becomes the intersection of these three, and the Holm-Bonferroni procedure for 
testing the general hypothesis was used as follows. The three p-values were ordered in the increasing order 
as p(1)<p(2)<p(3) If the smallest of the three p-values p(1) did not exceed 0.05/3 then the corresponding 
Hi  was  rejected  and  the  p(2)  was  compared  to  0.05/2,  and  if  p(2)<=  0.05/2,  then  the  hypothesis 
corresponding to p(2) was also rejected, and the remaining p(3) was compared to 0.05. In case p(3) ≤  0.05, 
then the corresponding Hi was also rejected. At this point, all the null hypotheses that were not been rejected 
remain not rejected, and the procedure terminated with the global H0 rejected only if at least one of the Hi 
was rejected. For the primary analysis, patients with missing data were classified as not having a complete 
response. 
The same logistic regression model was used to compare each dose of palonosetron plus netupitant to each 
other. This was done on a descriptive level, i.e. without adjustment for multiplicity. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  added  which  excluded  patients  who  did  not  complete 
diaries  or  did  not  provide  information  about  emetic  episode  and/or  use  of  rescue  medication  who  were 
considered, in  the  primary  analysis,  as  non  responders  following  the  worst  case  principle.  The  sensitivity 
analysis was only performed for the MFAS population. 
Additional  analyses  were  suggested  by  the  FDA  during  the  interactions  for  planning  the  phase  III 
development. The details of the changes are as follows: 
i. Analysis considering the CR in the delayed phase (defined as 25-120 hours after chemotherapy) as the 
primary efficacy endpoint. 
Since the delayed phase is the time frame where NK1 receptor antagonists are expected to be more effective, 
in the FDA opinion, the most sensitive endpoint for establishing the contribution of netupitant to the efficacy 
of the combination product is the CR 25-120 rather than the original primary efficacy endpoint CR 0-120. For 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 79/153 
 
  
  
  
this reason CR 25-120 was suggested to be the primary efficacy endpoint for the phase III development. Also, 
NETU- 07-07, in the light of his potential new role of pivotal study, should have been analysed accordingly. 
ii. Analysis using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by gender. The original analysis of the 
primary endpoint CR 0-120 was performed using a logistic regression model adjusted for gender. The FDA 
requested to replace this statistical test with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by gender. 
iii. Analysis using a hierarchical procedure to control the type I error. 
The procedure is to be applied to three endpoints CR in the delayed (CR 25-120), acute (CR 0-24) and overall 
(CR 0-120) phases. In the original plan, CR 0-24 and CR 25-120 were secondary efficacy endpoints and, as 
such, no specific procedure was in place for dealing with multiplicity.  
iv. Sensitivity analysis on the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population defined as all randomised patients. 
As mentioned, the efficacy analysis was originally performed considering the MFAS as the primary population 
of  analysis.  In  addition,  analysis  on  the  PP  population  and  a  sensitivity  analysis  on  complete  cases  were 
performed.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled to the trial on February 4th 2008, with last patient last visit on November 22nd 
2008. 
Conduct of the study 
The sponsor conducted a trial site audit to support the use of this study as the pivotal efficacy trial for HEC 
indication.  
One  site  in  Russia  (site  No.  120)  presented  multiple  major  audit  findings,  ranging  from  failure  to  meet 
eligibility criteria and administration of prohibited medications to inconsistencies between source data and 
Case  Report  Forms  (CRFs).  Regardless  of  these  findings,  according  to  intent  to  treat  principles,  the  site 
remains  part  of  all  planned  analyses.  However,  to  explore  whether  this  site  has  had  any  impact  on  the 
treatment effect, the sponsor provided the CR rates obtained after exclusion of all 39 patients enrolled at this 
site. 
The following table summarizes the CR rates in the overall (0-120 hours), acute (0-24 hours) and delayed 
(25-120  hours)  phases  after  the  start  of  chemotherapy  administration,  which  were  obtained  for  the  full 
analysis set (FAS) and the CR rates without/withdrawing the 39 patients from site No. 120.

CR rates across all treatment groups and in all three periods achieved after excluding all 39 patients from site 
120 are consistent with the CR rates from FAS. The differences in CR rates, with and without site 120, for the 
netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron 0.5 mg group are 0.7% in both, the overall and delayed phases, and 
0.1%  in  the  acute  phase.  When  considering  all  treatment  groups,  the  largest  difference  is  1.1%. 
Furthermore, the differences in CR rates did not seem to be systematically in one direction. This evidence 
supports the lack of impact of this site and the overall robustness of the study conclusions.

Chemotherapy administered to study participants is summarized in Table 28. Approximately 15% of patients 
were treated with cisplatin alone while cisplatin with concomitant chemotherapy with low (Hesketh level <3) 
or moderate to high (Hesketh level ≥3) emetogenic potential was administered to 51% and 34% of patients, 
respectively. Overall, the chemotherapy administered was comparable across treatment groups.

The populations were defined as follows: 
The full analysis set population (FAS) was defined as all patients who were randomised to treatment and 
received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen and at least one dose of study treatment. Following the 
intent-to-treat principle, patients were assigned to the study treatment group according to the treatment to 
which  they  have  been  randomised.  The  FAS  was  used  for  summarizing  demography  and  baseline 
characteristics. 
The  modified  FAS  (MFAS)  population  consisted  of  the  FAS  population  excluding  patients  randomised  to 
aprepitant  treatment  arm.  This  was  the  primary  population  for  efficacy  evaluation.  MFAS  was  used  for 
demography, baseline characteristics and efficacy parameters analysis. 
The per-protocol (PP) population consisted of all patients included in the MFAS who completed the 0-120 
study period and were compliant with the study protocol. The PP population was analyzed for the primary 
efficacy parameter, demographic data, and selected baseline characteristics. 
The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one study treatment and had at least one 
safety assessment after the treatment administration. Patients were assigned to the study treatment group 
according to the actual treatment received. The safety population was analyzed for demography, baseline 
characteristics and safety analysis.

The results from the MFAS population were supported by those from the PP population and the sensitivity 
analysis. 
On individual study days, i.e., 0-24 hours, 25-48 hours, 49-72 hours, 73-96 hours, and 97-120 hours, the 
netupitant 300 mg group showed the highest percentage of responder at each day. The difference between 
netupitant 300 mg and palonosetron alone ranged from 7% to 9% and was statistically significant on each 
day (chi-square p-value< 0.050), with the exception of day 4. 
•  Secondary endpoints 
•  No Emesis 
Only the 300mg netupitant dose showed consistent benefit through all the treatment phases.

Significant benefit was seen for the 300mg dose in all phases. 
• 
Time to first emetic event 
Kaplan  Meier  curves  of  netupitant  300  mg  and  palonosetron  alone  started  to  diverge  a  few  hours  after 
chemotherapy. Curves of netupitant 100 mg and 200 mg were very similar, but diverged from the curve for 
palonosetron alone later than the netupitant 300 mg curve did. The curves clearly show the higher efficacy of 
netupitant 300 mg in the first 24 hours and up to 44 hours compared to lower doses of netupitant. 
Since more than 75% of patients were considered censored at the end of the 120 hour observation period in 
all treatment groups (i.e. more than 75% of patients had no emetic episode throughout 120 hours), neither 
the 25% quantile nor the median time to first emetic episode could be calculated. A log-rank test stratified by 
gender showed that time to first emetic episode was significant longer for netupitant (p=0.003) and in each 
netupitant group (p≤ 0.020) than in the palonosetron alone group.

Patient global satisfaction 
For  the  MFAS  population,  the  daily  mean  patient  global  satisfaction  ranged  from  89.1  to  91.2  for  the 
palonosetron alone group and from 92.3 to 93.8, 92.0 to 94.6, and 94.0 to 95.3 for the netupitant 100 mg, 
200 mg, and 300 mg doses, respectively. During each 24-hour interval, the median score was 97.0 or 98.0 
in all treatment groups describing a very high patient satisfaction with the therapy for controlling the nausea 
and vomiting. Although the mean global satisfaction was smaller for palonosetron alone than for each dose of 
netupitant, the differences between palonosetron alone and the netupitant doses were small (0.85 to 5.51) 
and generally were not statistically significant. 
•  No Rescue medication 
In the MFAS population, antiemetic rescue medication to treat emesis or nausea was taken by 6 (4.4%), 3 
(2.2%),  and  2  (1.5%)  patients  in  the  palonosetron,  netupitant  100  mg,  and  netupitant  300  mg  groups, 
respectively.  Rescue  medication  included  metoclopramide  and  ondansetron.  Three  patients  (2  in  the 
palonosetron group, 1 in the netupitant 300 mg group) received antiemetics as prevention of nausea and 
vomiting  for  a  subsequent  cycle  of  chemotherapy.  Since  the  antiemetic  drugs  were  administered  as 
prevention and cannot be considered as rescue medication, those three patients were not counted.

Notes 
As  requested  by  the  FDA  an  analysis  on  the  ITT  population  has  been 
performed as a sensitivity analysis. 
Out of 694 randomised patients, 17 were not included in the FAS population, 
because  they  were  not  treated  (15  patients)  or  did  not  receive  HEC  (2 
patients). Among these 17 patients 
- 5 patients were randomised to palo+ netu 200 mg1  
- 8 to palo+netu 300 mg2 
- 4 to aprepitant + ondansetron group (all not treated).  
All these patients were discontinued from the study apart the one having not 
received the HEC in palo+netu 300 mg group.  
NETU-08-18: 
A phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group study of 
the efficacy and safety of oral netupitant administered in combination with palonosetron and dexamethasone 
compared  to  oral  palonosetron  and  dexamethasone  for  the  prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  in  cancer 
patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.

Methods 
Study Participants  
The  study  population  consisted of  adult  (≥18  years  of  age)  chemotherapy-naïve  male  or  female  patients 
scheduled  to  receive  their  first  course  of  an  anthracycline  and  cyclophosphamide  MEC  regimen  for  the 
treatment  of  a  solid  malignant  tumour.  Patients  were  required  to  have  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2, fulfil criteria indicating a hematologic and metabolic status 
adequate for receiving a MEC regimen, and to be able to understand/follow study procedures and complete 
the patient diary. Female patients of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test 
within  24  hours  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  study  drugs  on  Day  1  and  to  practice  an  acceptable  method of 
contraception during the study. 
Patients could not participate in the study if they experienced vomiting, retching, or mild nausea within 24 
hours prior to Day 1, if they were currently using illicit drugs or abusing alcohol, were scheduled to receive 
any highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) from Day 1 to Day 5 or MEC from Day 2 to Day 5 following the 
allowed MEC regimen, received (within 1 week prior to Day 1) or were scheduled to receive (between Days 1 
to 5 of cycle 1) radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis, had symptomatic primary or metastatic central 
nervous system malignancy or any uncontrolled medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, 
may  have  confounded  the  results  of  the  study  or  posed  unwarranted  risk  in  administering  the  study 
medication. Females could not be pregnant or lactating. 
For  inclusion  in  the  multiple-cycle  extension,  participation  had  to  be  considered  appropriate  by  the 
investigator  and  could  not  pose  unwarranted  risk  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  the  patient  had  to  have 
demonstrated satisfactory study compliance in the preceding chemotherapy cycles and study procedures. 
Patients entered the multiple cycle extension if receiving the same chemotherapy regimen as at cycle 1 and 
if they had an adequate metabolic status. Patients could not participate in the multiple-cycle extension if they 
had an active infection or uncontrolled disease except for malignancy, had started any restricted medications, 
or had vomiting, retching, or mild nausea within 24 hours prior to Day 1. Females could not be pregnant or 
lactating. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised to receive either the oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) FDC with oral 
dexamethasone  12  mg  or  oral  palonosetron  0.50  mg  with  oral  dexamethasone  20  mg  preceding  the 
administration of MEC on the first day of cycle 1. After cycle 1, patients could continue in a multiple-cycle 
extension phase, i.e., they could participate in consecutive repeated chemotherapy cycles (at least 21 days 
apart from each other) as long as they continued to fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria. On Day 1 of each 
repeat cycle, the patients received the same study drugs as in cycle 1. 
During cycle 1, patients participated in the study for a maximum of 37 days  (including an up to 14 days 
screening period, one day of treatment, and a follow-up visit or a telephone call of 21±2 days after Day 1). 
In  the  multiple-cycle  extension,  patients  participated  for  a  maximum  of  30  days  in  every  repeat  cycle 
(including an up to 7 days screening period, one day of treatment, and a follow-up visit or a telephone call 21
±2 days after Day 1. 
EMA/236963/2015

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of a single oral dose of a fixed combination of 
netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) with oral dexamethasone versus oral palonosetron 0.50 mg with 
oral dexamethasone in terms of Complete Response (CR) in the delayed phase (25-120 hours) at cycle 1. 
Secondary objectives were: 
• To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of a Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) of 
netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) with oral dexamethasone to oral palonosetron 0.50 mg with oral 
dexamethasone  for  the  prevention  of  moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapy  (MEC)-induced  nausea  and 
vomiting in initial and repeat cycles. 
•  To  assess  the  population  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  netupitant  (and  its 
metabolites M1, M2 and M3) and palonosetron in patients that have received the combination product. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with CR (defined as no emesis, no 
rescue  medication)  in  the  delayed  phase  (time  interval  25-120  hours  after  the  start  of  the  MEC 
administration) at cycle 1. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints were defined at cycle 1 as the proportion of patients with: 
•  CR during the acute phase (0-24 hours). 
•  CR during the overall phase (0-120 hours). 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were defined at cycle 1 as the proportion of patients with: 
•  No emesis during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. 
•  No rescue medication during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. 
•  No significant nausea (Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] <25 mm) during the delayed, acute, and overall 
phase. 
•  No nausea (VAS <5 mm) during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. 
•  Complete protection (no emesis, no rescue medication and no significant nausea [maximum nausea 
VAS <25 mm]) during the delayed, acute, and overall phase. 
• 
Total control (no emesis, no rescue medication and no nausea [maximum VAS <5 mm]) during the 
delayed, acute, and overall phase. 
Other efficacy endpoints at cycle 1 were defined as follows: 
•  Severity of nausea, defined as the maximum nausea on the VAS in the acute, delayed, and overall 
phase. 
• 
Time to first emetic episode, time to first rescue medication intake, and time to treatment failure 
(based on time to the first emetic episode or time to the first rescue medication intake, whichever 
occurs first) 
• 
Impact on patients’ daily life activities for the first 120 hours following the administration of MEC as 
assessed by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 99/153 
 
  
  
  
Secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated during the multiple-cycle extension were the proportion of patients 
with: 
•  CR during the delayed, acute, and overall phase following subsequent cycles of MEC. 
•  No significant nausea during the delayed, acute, and overall phase following subsequent MEC cycles. 
Safety: Safety assessments included physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Left 
Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) levels, laboratory tests (haematology, blood 
chemistry, urinalysis) and Adverse Events (AEs). 
Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: Details on the population PK and PD of netupitant (and 
its metabolites M1, M2 and M3) and palonosetron are described in a separate study report (NETU-10-02). 
Sample size 
The sample size was estimated to be 1460 patients, equally distributed in 2 treatment groups (730 patients 
per group). 
The  assumption  was  a  CR  rate  in  the  time  interval  25-120  hours  of  cycle  1  of  60%  in  the 
netupitant/palonosetron fixed combination group and 51% in the palonosetron group. For a 2-sided test of 
difference using α=0.050, a sample size of 661 evaluable patients per group was needed to ensure 90% 
power  to  detect  the  above  mentioned  9%  difference.  This  number  was  increased  to  730  patients  per 
treatment group for a total of 1460 patients, to ensure an adequate number of evaluable patients. 
Regarding the key secondary efficacy endpoints, this same sample size gave the study a power of about 60% 
(61%) to detect a difference of 6% in the CR rate in the acute phase (assuming rates of 70% and 64% in the 
fixed combination and palonosetron groups, respectively). The power to detect a difference of 9% in terms of 
CR in the overall phase was close to 90%. 
Randomisation 
Patients were assigned to treatment groups through a static central blocked randomisation scheme, stratified 
by region (US, Latin America including Mexico, Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States [i.e., former 
Soviet Republics], Asia) and age class (age <55 years and age ≥ 55 years). 
Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to one of the two treatment groups in a 
balanced  design  (1:1),  according  to  specific  procedures  using  the  Randomisation  and  Trial  Supply 
Management  (RTSM)  system,  accessed  by  Electronic  Data  Capture  (EDC)  or  Interactive  Voice  Response 
System (IVRS). Two randomisation lists were prepared, one for each age class. For each region a different 
block of the relevant list was allocated, i.e., each time a new region started to randomize patients or each 
time a block for the relevant region was completed, the next unused block was attributed to that region. 
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain study blinding, matching placebos were manufactured for each of the study drugs and additional 
study drug. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy: The number and percentage of patients with CR by treatment group and the difference in response 
rate between the treatment groups was summarized. The 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the response rate 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 100/153 
 
  
  
  
(using the Wilson score method) and for the difference in response rate (using Newcombe-Wilson method) 
were  also  provided.  The  primary  analysis  was  performed  on  the  FAS  using  a  2-sided  stratum  adjusted 
Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test including treatment, age class and region as strata. All missing data 
were imputed as treatment failures, following the worst case principle. The null hypothesis of no difference 
between treatments was to be rejected, and the superiority of the fixed combination versus oral palonosetron 
alone demonstrated, if the 2-sided p-value from the CMH test was less than or equal to 0.050 and in the right 
direction i.e., the Odds Ratio (OR) was in favour of the fixed combination. The Ors and the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the ORs from the CMH test were presented.  
Key and other secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the same way. To avoid type I error inflation, a 
hierarchical approach to testing was used. Once the null hypothesis of no treatment difference for the primary 
efficacy endpoint was rejected (i.e., primary study objective was met), further confirmatory statistical tests 
were performed on key secondary efficacy endpoints in the following order: CR in the acute phase, followed 
by CR in the overall phase (tested only if the fixed oral combination was superior to oral palonosetron for CR 
in the acute phase).  
The other secondary efficacy endpoints (no emesis, no rescue medication intake, no nausea, no significant 
nausea, complete protection and total control) were grouped together into families by phase (delayed, acute, 
and  overall).  Each  family  was  tested  only  if  the  fixed  combination  demonstrated  superiority  versus  oral 
palonosetron  for  CR  for  that  phase.  Results  of  analyses  for  other  efficacy  endpoints  were  interpreted 
descriptively with nominal p-values. 
Safety:  All  safety  analyses  were  performed  for  the  safety  population  for  cycle  1  and  the  multiple-cycle 
extension. The incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), defined as an AE that begins or 
worsens in severity after the start of the first administration of the study drug, in each treatment group was 
presented  overall,  by  system  organ  class  and  preferred  term,  and  additionally  grouped  by  severity  and 
relationship  to  the  study  drug.  TEAE  relationship  was  summarized  separately  for  events  related  to  study 
drugs (netupitant/palonosetron, palonosetron), events related to dexamethasone, and overall (i.e., related 
to study drugs or dexamethasone). The number of patients with serious TEAEs and the number of patients 
with TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study were summarized. All AEs were listed.  
Laboratory  data  were  summarized  as  follows:  descriptive  statistics  for  observed  values  and  change  from 
baseline (and the same cycle ‘screening’ for cycle 2 onwards), shift tables from baseline (and the same 
cycle ‘screening’ for cycle 2 onwards) with respect to normal ranges, and  tabulation of the number  of 
patients with at least one marked abnormality (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicology criteria [NCI 
CTC] grade ≥ 3) for selected haematology and blood chemistry parameters with respect to normal ranges. All 
data were listed.  
cTnI levels were summarized for each visit by treatment for cycle 1 and the multiple cycle extension using 
descriptive statistics. All troponin levels were listed.  
ECG data were summarized highlighting differences from baseline (and the same cycle ‘pre-dose reference 
value’ for cycle 2 onwards) for quantitative variables and frequencies of treatment-emergent abnormalities. 
An outlier analysis was performed to show the number of patients who met pre-specified criteria. Physical 
examination,  vital  signs  and  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  data  were  summarized  using  descriptive 
statistics, in addition to being listed.

The following definitions of analysis populations were used for cycle 1. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all patients who were randomised to treatment and received a MEC 
regimen and the study drug. Following the  Intent-To-Treat (ITT) principle, patients were assigned to the 
study drug group according to the treatment to which they had been randomised. The FAS  was  used for 
summarizing demography and baseline characteristics, primary and all efficacy analyses. The FAS was the 
main population for the efficacy analyses. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population consisted of all patients included in the FAS who completed the 0-120 study 
period  with  no  major  protocol  violations.  The  PP  population  was  used  for  demography,  other  baseline 
characteristics and for supportive primary and key secondary efficacy analyses. 
The ITT population consisted of all patients who were randomised to treatment. Following the ITT principle, 
patients  were  assigned  to  the  study  drug  group  according  to  the  treatment  to  which  they  had  been 
randomised. The ITT population was used for demography and for the primary efficacy endpoint sensitivity 
analysis. 
The Safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one study drug and had at least one 
safety  assessment  after  the  treatment  administration.  Patients  were  assigned  to  the  study  drug  group 
according to the actual treatment received. A safety assessment after treatment administration was defined 
as any ECG or vital signs or laboratory result or evaluation of the presence or absence of AE. The safety 
population was used for demography, baseline characteristics and all safety analyses. 
The PK population consisted of all patients who participated in the PK portion of the study. Patients that had 
at  least  one  measurable  concentration  of  netupitant  and  palonosetron  and  corresponding  information 
regarding the time and date of drug administration and the PK sample were included. 
The following definitions of analysis populations were used for the multiple-cycle extension. 
The FAS was defined as all patients who entered the multiple-cycle extension and received a MEC regimen 
and the study drugs in the first cycle of the multiple-cycle extension. Following the ITT principle, patients 
were assigned to the study drug group according to the treatment to which they had been randomised at 
cycle  1.  The  FAS  was  used  for  summarizing  demography  and  baseline  characteristics  and  for  efficacy 
analyses.

The Safety population consisted of all patients who entered the multiple-cycle extension and received at least 
one  study  drug  and  had  at  least  one  safety  assessment  after  the  treatment  administration.  A  safety 
assessment after treatment administration was any ECG or vital signs or laboratory result or evaluation of the 
presence or absence of AE. Patients were assigned to the study drug group according to the actual treatment 
they received. In cases where a patient received different treatments in different study cycles in error, he/she 
was  to  be  included  in  the  safety  population  for  the  treatment  actually  received  at  cycle  1.  For  by-cycle 
summaries, the patient was analyzed in each cycle according to the actual treatment received. The safety 
population was used for demography, baseline characteristics and all safety analyses.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No formal statistical analyses were performed to compare the efficacy results generated in the efficacy clinical 
trials due significant differences in the methodologies used in those trials.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No specific studies were carried out to investigate the efficacy of the FDC in special populations. Subjects who 
had severe renal or hepatic impairment were excluded from the pivotal efficacy and safety studies. For data 
on elderly patients see pharmacology part of this report. 
Supportive studies 
Study PALO-10-01 was a phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 
parallel group, stratified study in patients receiving HEC. Patients were randomised on Day 1 of their first 
chemotherapy cycle before administration of HEC to one of the following treatment groups: 
•  Oral palonosetron 0.50 mg (Aloxi) and oral dexamethasone 20 mg both given on Day 1, followed by 
dexamethasone (8 mg) twice daily (bid) from Days 2 through 4. 
• 
I.V. palonosetron 0.25 mg (Aloxi) and oral dexamethasone 20 mg both given on Day 1, followed by 
dexamethasone (8 mg bid) from Days 2 through 4. 
Patients participated in the study for a maximum of 37 days (including a screening period of up to 14 days, 
6+2 days on study of which 4 days on active treatment, and a follow-up visit or a telephone call 21±2 days 
after Day 1). 
Study PALO-10-01 was intended to provide evidence of efficacy of oral palonosetron 0.50 mg in the HEC 
setting in comparison to I.V. palonosetron 0.25 mg, focusing on the 0-24 hour period.  
The primary efficacy objective was the demonstration of non-inferiority of oral palonosetron 0.50 mg versus 
I.V. palonosetron 0.25 mg in terms of proportion of patients with CR in the acute phase (defined as no emesis 
and no rescue medication within 24 hours after the start of the HEC administration).  
The percentage of patients with CR in the acute phase in the FAS was 89.4% in the oral palonosetron group 
and  86.2%  in  the  I.V.  palonosetron  group.  The  difference  in  proportion  between  the  oral  and  I.V. 
palonosetron groups was 3.21% (99%CI: -2.74% to 9.17%).  
Non-inferiority of oral palonosetron versus I.V. palonosetron was demonstrated since the lower limit of the 
two-sided 99% CI for the difference in proportions was greater (i.e. closer to zero) than the pre-defined 
non-inferiority margin set at -15%. Similar results were obtained in the PP population with a difference in 
proportions between the oral and I.V. palonosetron group of 3.77% (99% CI: -3.22% to 10.76% from 
stratum-adjusted CMH method for difference in proportions). Planned sensitivity analyses supported the 
results obtained on the primary efficacy endpoint.

Study NETU-10-29 was a safety trial providing also supportive efficacy information in MEC and HEC. It was 
a  multinational,  randomised  active-controlled,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  unbalanced  (3:1),  parallel 
group, stratified multi-cycle trial evaluating the safety and describing the efficacy of the FDC vs aprepitant + 
palonosetron. The study was stratified by chemotherapy emetogenicity and gender.  
The primary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of FDC in initial and 
repeated cycles of chemotherapy. The secondary objective was to describe the efficacy of the FDC during the 
acute (0-24 hours), delayed (25-120 hours) and overall (0-120 hours) phases of initial and repeated cycles 
of chemotherapy. Efficacy data were supportive of the conclusions drawn from the pivotal trials. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
CHMP  scientific  advice  given  to  the  design  and  conduct  of  the  clinical  studies  was  broadly  followed.  The 
patient population recruited to clinical trials was appropriate and generally representative of those normally 
receiving such chemotherapy regimens. It was noted by the CHMP that in the MEC study NETU-08-18 an 
anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC) regime was chosen to support the MEC indication. Recently, in the 
MEC setting, MASCC/ESMO clinical antiemetic guidelines have given special consideration to patient-related 
risk factors contributing to the emetogenic potential for patients receiving AC-based chemotherapy. While 
historically guidance has been based solely on the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy the young age and 
female  gender  of  the  population  that  typically  receive  AC-based  chemotherapy  may  put  this  group  at  an 
increased risk for CINV over what AC chemotherapy alone would suggest. 
It is taken into consideration by the CHMP that AC chemotherapy has previously served as gold standard of 
the MEC regimen in antiemetic efficacy pivotal trials being a “worst-case” emetogenicity representative for 
MEC  chemotherapy.  Notwithstanding  the  recent  change  of  the  clinical  antiemetic  guidelines  this  model is 
currently  considered  to  be  familiar  to  clinicians  for  use  to  prevent  CINV  induced  by  MEC.  Therefore,  to 
adequately inform prescribers, the fact that an AC regimen was used in the MEC pivotal trial was included into 
the SmPC. 
Dose levels and groups as described are considered appropriate with regards to the objectives of the pivotal 
trials submitted and dexamethasone doses were appropriately adjusted to balance exposure across groups. 
Objectives were appropriate in the context of the clinical evaluation of agents for the treatment or prevention 
of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The primary and secondary outcomes and endpoints of the 
studies  were  appropriate  and  in  accordance  with  advice  previously  received  from  CHMP.  Sample  size 
calculations and statistical methods were appropriate, the randomisation schemes appear to be robust and 
blinding methods are considered satisfactory. 
For  study  PALO-10-01  the  determination  of  the  non-inferiority  margin  and  subsequent  sample  size 
calculation  was  appropriate  and  in  accordance  with  non-inferiority  margins  from  other  CINV  trials  in  the 
public domain.  
For study NETU-07-07 a sponsor audit of a site in Russia presented multiple major audit findings. Complete 
response rates with and without all 39 patients enrolled at this site were consistent with the CR rates from the 
FAS and differences in CR rates did not seem to be systematically in one direction supporting the lack of 
impact of this site and the overall robustness of the study conclusions. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 115/153 
 
  
  
  
The CHMP guidance document for the evaluation of medicinal products for the prevention and treatment of 
CINV states that patients entering a multiple cycle extension phase of a trial should be re-randomised prior 
to  allocation  of  treatment  to  ensure  that  both  treatment  arms  are  balanced.  For  study  NETU-08-18, 
re-randomisation did not occur following enrolment into the Multiple-Cycle Extension (MCE)  . Therefore the 
applicant was asked to reanalyse this phase. Presented results supported the persistence of the antiemetic 
effect in multiple cycles and are considered satisfactory. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
NETU 07-07 (HEC study) 
Study NETU-07-07 evaluated palonosetron alone versus palonosetron plus netupitant 100 mg, 200 mg and 
300 mg in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin-based regimen). All patients also 
received  concomitant  dexamethasone.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
complete response (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) in the overall phase. 
Results  for  the  primary  endpoint  showed  statistical  significance  in  favour  of  netupitant  300  mg  plus 
palonosetron (p=0.004) with a difference of netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron versus palonosetron alone 
on  the  order  of  13.2%,  which  can  be  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Secondary  efficacy  parameters 
consistently  showed  an  advantage  of  the  300  mg  netupitant  dose  compared  to  lower  netupitant  doses, 
particularly in the delayed and overall phases. 
The percentage of patients in the MFAS with delayed CR was 80.1% in the palonosetron alone group and 
90.4%,  91.2%,  and  90.4%  in  the  netupitant  100  mg,  200  mg,  and  300  mg  plus  palonosetron  groups, 
respectively.  Differences  from  palonosetron  alone  ranged  from  10.2%  to  11.1%.  The  logistic  regression 
analysis,  including  gender  as  a  covariate,  showed  that  all  netupitant  plus  palonosetron  doses  were 
statistically superior to palonosetron alone. The contribution of netupitant in the delayed phase (25-120 hour 
time period) can therefore be considered demonstrated. In addition, a sensitivity analysis done by excluding 
patients with missing data about emetic episodes/use of rescue medication who were considered as failures 
in the primary analysis were statistically significant and supported the results of primary analysis (p=0.008), 
as  well  as  an  additional  sensitivity  analysis  with  subjects  allocated  to  the  actual  treatment  received 
(p=0.008). 
The study was not powered to demonstrate differences in efficacy between the respective Netupitant doses. 
results showed that the 300 mg netupitant dose was statistically superior to palonosetron alone in the acute, 
delayed and overall period. The 200 and 100 mg netupitant doses were statistically superior to palonosetron 
alone  in  the  overall  and  delayed  periods  only.  Secondary  efficacy  parameters  consistently  showed  an 
advantage of the 300 mg netupitant dose compared to lower netupitant doses, particularly in the delayed and 
overall phases. Additionally the analysis of safety data including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
laboratory values, vital signs and 12-lead ECGs in Study NETU-07-07 did not raise any safety concerns for the 
administration  of  palonosetron  in  combination  with  netupitant  at  any  of  the  three  dose  levels  tested.  
Furthermore,  there  were  no  increases  in  severity  of  AEs  over  the  dosing  range  of  100  mg  to  300  mg  in 
NETU-07-07  and  it  is  reasonable  that  the  300  mg  dose  was  carried  forward  into  later  clinical  trials 
NETU-08-18 and NETU-10-29 for confirmation of that finding. 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 116/153 
 
  
  
  
 
In  a  post-hoc  analysis  the  efficacy  of  the  aprepitant/ondansetron  regimen  versus  the  netupitant  300  mg 
/palonosetron  regimen  was  compared.  Primary  and  secondary  parameters  were  analyzed  for  the  overall, 
acute and delayed phase as an exploratory analysis. The percentage of responders in the netupitant 300 mg 
arm was numerically higher than the aprepitant/ondansetron for all efficacy endpoints during each phase. 
NETU-08-18 (MEC study) 
Study  NETU-08-18  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  netupitant  plus  palonosetron  (with  dexamethasone)  versus 
palonosetron  alone  (with  dexamethasone)  in  breast  cancer  patients  receiving  moderately  emetogenic 
chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or epirubicin). The primary efficacy endpoint was 
the percentage of patients with CR in the delayed phase at cycle 1. 
During the first chemotherapy cycle the percentage of patients in the delayed phase with CR was higher in the 
combination  group  (76.9%)  than  the  palonosetron  alone  group  (69.5%),  with  a  difference  from  the 
palonosetron alone group of 7.4% which can be considered a clinically relevant difference. The superiority of 
netupitant/palonosetron to palonosetron alone was demonstrated (CMH OR: 1.47 with 95% CI from 1.17 to 
1.85; p=0.001). The results of the PP population supported these results. For the key secondary endpoints, 
the proportion of patients with CR in the acute phase was 3.4% higher in the netupitant/palonosetron FDC 
than in the palonosetron alone group (88.4% vs. 85.0%; from CMH test: OR: 1.37, p=0.047) and in the 
overall phase the CR rate was 7.7% higher in the netupitant/palonosetron FDC than in the palonosetron alone 
group (74.3% vs. 66.6%; from CMH test: OR: 1.47, p=0.001). 
Overall,  the  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  consistently  supported  those  of  the  primary  and  key 
secondary  endpoints  for  the  delayed  and  overall  phases.  In  particular,  a  statistically  significantly  greater 
proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron FDC group compared with the palonosetron alone group 
had no emesis in the delayed (81.8% vs. 75.6%; p=0.004), acute (90.9% vs. 87.3%; p=0.025) and overall 
(79.8% vs. 72.1%; p<0.001) phases. There was a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in 
the netupitant/palonosetron FDC group compared with the palonosetron alone group who did not take rescue 
medication in the delayed (85.8% vs. 80.6%; p=0.007) and overall (84.0% vs. 79.0%; p=0.014) phases, 
but this difference was not significant in the acute phase.  
Although a slightly higher proportion of patients had no nausea in the netupitant/palonosetron FDC group in 
the  delayed,  acute  and  overall  phases,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the 
netupitant/palonosetron and the palonosetron groups.  
However, there was a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in the netupitant/palonosetron 
FDC group than in the palonosetron alone group with no significant nausea in the delayed (76.9% vs. 71.3%; 
p=0.014) and overall (74.6% vs. 69.1%; p=0.020) phases. 
Complete  protection  rates  were  statistically  significantly  higher  in  the  netupitant/palonosetron  group 
compared to the palonosetron group in the delayed (67.3% vs. 60.3%; p=0.005) and overall (63.8% vs. 
57.9%; p=0.020) phases, but not in the acute phase.  
Total control rates were higher in the netupitant/palonosetron group than the palonosetron group for the 
delayed (51.5% vs. 46.9%; p=0.077) and overall (48.3% vs. 44.0%; p=0.095) phases but the test failed to 
reach statistical significance. The results of the other efficacy endpoints corroborated the overall results of the 
study.

During 
the  multiple-cycle  extension, 
the  CR 
rates  were  consistently  higher 
for 
the 
netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  than  for  palonosetron  alone  in  each  phase  up  to  cycle  6.  Similarly,  the 
percentage of patients with no significant nausea was higher in the netupitant/palonosetron group than the 
palonosetron group in each phase and each cycle up to cycle 6. 
The  impact  of  nausea  and  vomiting  on  patients’  daily  lives  was  assessed  using  the  Functional  Living 
Index–Emesis (FLIE), a validated specific patient-reported outcome measure of the impact of nausea and 
vomiting on daily life. The proportion of patients with Overall no impact on daily life was 6.3% higher (p value 
=0.005) in the Akynzeo group (78.5%) than in the palonosetron group (72.1%).  
The proportion of patients with no impact on daily life of the Vomiting Domain was 5.6% higher (p value 
=0.001) in the Akynzeo group (90.1%) than in the palonosetron group (84.4%). The proportion of patients 
with no impact on daily life of the Nausea Domain was 5.8% higher (p value =0.015) in the Akynzeo group 
(71.5%) than in the palonosetron group (65.8%).  
PALO-10-01 
This study demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral palonosetron 0.50 mg compared with I.V. palonosetron 
0.25 mg in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint i.e. CR in the acute phase. The two treatment groups 
showed a similar efficacy profile when considering CR in the delayed and overall phases after administration 
of HEC, and other secondary endpoints in all phases, including, among others, the proportion of patients with 
no  emesis,  with  no  rescue  medication,  with  no  nausea  or  with  no  significant  nausea  and  the  complete 
protection rate. The data generated were considered supportive for the HEC setting. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Oral administration of Akynzeo in combination with dexamethasone has been shown to prevent acute and 
delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in two 
separate pivotal studies. 
Results of the pivotal studies show a statistical superiority in terms of acute, overall and, notably, of delayed 
emesis (endpoint of major clinical interest) of netupitant plus palonosetron over palonosetron alone in cancer 
patients receiving cisplatin regimen and a combination of anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide regimen. 
The advantages of this fixed-dose combination [netupitant+palonosetron] include an improvement of the 
benefit/risk due to an addition of therapeutic activity of the substances, particularly in the delayed phase of

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The overall safety population included a total of 4331 subjects. The ISS database contains safety data from 
3280 patients with cancer who received at least one dose of the investigational medicinal product or the 
active comparators during the Phase 2/3 CINV studies; of these patients, 1862 were treated in the Phase 3 
multi-cycle studies. Supporting data are presented from 1051 subjects who received at least one dose of the 
investigational product in healthy volunteer studies (N = 702) and studies in special populations (N = 349).

During  the  development  programme,  a  total  of  1939  subjects  received  any  dose  of  netupitant  and 
palonosetron  in  combination  (either  as  the  FDC  or  extemporaneous  formulation),  including  1442  cancer 
patients participating in Phase 2/3 studies, The 1939 subjects who were exposed to netupitant-palonosetron 
combination (any dose) had a total of 5843 exposures. 
A total of 1538 subjects and patients were exposed to the netupitant-palonosetron combination 
at the proposed market dose (300/0.50 mg) during the clinical program with a total number of 5441 
exposures: 1169 patients with cancer received at least one dose while participating in one of the Phase 2/3 
studies.  
There were 550 patients who received 6 or more consecutive cycles of chemotherapy; 317 of these 
received the FDC (300/0.50 mg). A total of 1033 MEC and 286 HEC patients received the proposed market 
dose of 300 mg netupitant and 0.50 mg palonosetron.

The study population of 1442 patients with cancer treated with combinations of netupitant (100, 200, and 
300 mg) and palonosetron (0.50 mg) in the Phase 2/3 studies comprised 401 men (27.8%) and 1041 females 
(72.2%),  was  predominantly  white  (86.0%),  and  had  a  mean  (SD)  age  of  54.5  (10.4)  years;  by  age 
stratification, the majority (82.2%) of treated patients were < 65 years of age. As with the overall safety 
population,  gender  differences  were  largely  attributable  to  those  observed  in  Study  NETU-08-18  (711 
females vs 14 males who received the netupitant/palonosetron FDC [300/0.50 mg]).  There were no other 
notable demographic differences between patients who received palonosetron 0.50 mg in combination with 
netupitant doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg. Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics of patients 
with cancer in the Phase 2/3 studies were well balanced, regardless of palonosetron dose (0.25 mg IV or 0.50 
mg PO) or 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. 
Adverse events 
Phase 2/3 Cancer Patients  
Cycle 1  
During cycle 1 in the Phase 2/3 studies, overall 61.7% (2024/3280 patients) reported at least 1 TEAE. The 
percent of patients was similar in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (65.5%, 944/1442 patients) and the 
palonosetron groups (59.1%, 945/1600 patients). In the comparator groups, the overall incidence of patients 
with at least 1 TEAE was 56.7% (135/238).  
Throughout the programme TEAEs were most commonly reported in body systems (SOC) that are most often 
involved with the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy administration. In cycle 1, across the treatment groups, 
TEAEs were most commonly reported (> 10%) in the following SOCs  
•  blood and lymphatic system disorders (21.8%, 716/3280);  
• 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (19.0%, 624/3280);  
•  gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (15.1%, 496/3280);  
•  general disorders and administration site conditions (14.6%, 478/3280); and  
• 
investigations (10.1%, 332/3280)  
The frequencies of patients reporting TEAEs in each of these SOCs were similar across the total (all doses) 
netupitant-palonosetron,  palonosetron,  and  comparator  groups,  except  for  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders, which were reported less frequently in the total comparator group (7.1%, 17/238 patients) than in 
the  total  netupitant-palonosetron  (22.3%,  321/1442  patients)  and  total  palonosetron  groups  (17.9%, 
286/1600 patients); and blood and lymphatic system disorders, which were also reported less frequently in 
the  total  comparator  group  (13.9%,  33/238  patients)  than  in  the  total  netupitant-palonosetron  (24.5%, 
353/1442 patients) and total palonosetron groups (20.6%, 330/1600 patients).  
Among the patients treated with netupitant-palonosetron, the frequency of patients experiencing at least 1 
TEAE ranged from 40.7% (55/135 patients) in the 100/0.50 mg group to 70.0% (818/1169 patients) in the 
300/0.50 mg group. In the palonosetron groups, the frequency of TEAEs was 51.8% in the 0.25 mg IV group 
(191/369 patients) and 61.3% in the 0.50 oral group (754/1231 patients). 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 122/153 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Similarly,  the  percent  of  patients  with  at  least  1  TEAE  assessed  as  being  related  to  study  drugs  by  the 
investigator  was  similar  in  the  netupitant-palonosetron  groups  (9.6%,  138/1442  patients)  and  the 
palonosetron groups (6.6%, 105/1600 patients) during cycle 1 in the Phase 2/3 studies. In the comparator 
groups,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  a  related  TEAE  was  12.2%  (29/238).  No  clear  pattern  was  seen 
across the netupitant-palonosetron dose groups or between the 2 palonosetron dose groups. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (i.e., those reported by > 5% of patients in any treatment group overall) 
were alopecia, neutropenia, leukopenia, asthenia, headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, and decreased appetite but 
these events generally occurred in similar percentages of patients across the 3 treatment groups.  
In the Phase 2/3 cancer patients overall, most TEAEs were of mild (27.4%, 900/3280) or moderate (24.5%, 
803/3280)  intensity.  Less  than  10%  of  patients  had  severe  TEAEs  (9.8%,  320/3280)  which  were  mostly 
caused  by  chemotherapy  toxicity  (haematologic  disorders  and  alopecia).  The  frequency  distribution  of 
severity was similar across the treatment groups.  
As far as drug-related TEAEs, the only PTs that were reported in ≥ 2% of patients overall or in any total 
treatment  group  were  headache  and  constipation.  Headache  occurred  in  2.2%  of  patients  in  the 
netupitant-palonosetron groups, 2.0% in the palonosetron groups and 1.7% in the aprepitant+palonosetron 
comparator groups. Constipation occurred at a frequency of 1.6% after oral palonosetron and 2.0% after the 
FDC 300/0.50 mg but was not greater than 2.0% in the overall dose groups.  
There was no increased incidence of TEAE or suggestion of accumulated toxicity with repeated dosing.

All Cycles 
Considering all cycles in the Phase 2/3 studies, the incidence of AEs was higher compared to cycle 1 only, as 
multi-cycle events were added for this analysis. Overall, there were 72.3% (2373/3280) of patients with at 
least 1 TEAE in all cycles compared to 67.1% (2024/3280 patients) in cycle 1.  
The percent of patients with TEAEs was higher in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (78.2%, 1127/1442 
patients)  than  in  the  palonosetron  groups  (67.5%,  1080/1600  patients)  and  in  the  comparator  groups 
(69.7%, 166/238 patients).  
The percent of patients with TEAEs assessed as being related to study drugs by the investigator was similar 
in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (13.5%, 194/1442 patients) and in the comparator groups (13.4%, 
32/238) and lower in the palonosetron groups (8.4%, 134/1600 patients). No clear pattern was seen across 
the netupitant-palonosetron dose groups or between the 2 palonosetron dose groups. 
Phase 3 Multi-cycle Studies  
All Cycles  
Of the 1862 patients in the multi-cycle study safety population, 89.7% (1670/1862) experienced at least 1 
TEAE  in  the  two  multi-cycle  studies,  with  a  similar  frequency  across  the  3  treatment  groups:  90.3% 
(933/1033 patients) in the netupitant-palonosetron group, 88.6% (642/725 patients) in the palonosetron 
group, and 91.3% (95/104 patients) in the comparator aprepitant+palonosetron group. 
Overall,  11.7%  of  patients  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  assessed  as  being  related  to  study  drugs  by  the 
investigator, with higher percentages of patients in the netupitant-palonosetron group (12.7%, 131/1033 
patients)  and 
in  the  palonosetron  group  (11.2%,  81/725  patients)  than 
in  the  comparator 
aprepitant+palonosetron group (5.8%, 6/104 patients). However, the number of patients in the comparator 
group is small and may therefore not allow a fair comparison.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
Phase 2/3 Cancer Patients 
Cycle 1  
The  overall  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  during  cycle  1  of  the  Phase  2/3  studies  was  3.8%;  2.3%  in  the 
netupitant-palonosetron groups, 5.4% in the palonosetron group, and 1.7% in the aprepitant+5-HT3 group.  
The most commonly reported events were coded to the system organ classes of blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (1.2%, overall), GI disorders (0.8%), general disorders and administration site conditions (0.5%), 
and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (0.5%).  
By preferred term, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were the most commonly reported serious TEAEs; 
these are known to be frequent events associated with the administration of chemotherapy. Both of these 
serious TEAEs were reported in the palonosetron (0.9% and 0.6% for neutropenia and febrile neutropenia) 
and netupitant-palonosetron groups (0.2% and 0.3%, respectively), but not in the aprepitant+5-HT3 group.

Four patients (< 0.1%) in cycle 1 of the Phase 2/3 studies had serious TEAEs that were considered by the 
investigator to be related to investigational product: 2 patients in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (events 
of loss of consciousness and acute psychosis) and 2 patients in the palonosetron group (0.50 mg PO; events 
of abdominal pain and constipation in 1 patient, and diarrhoea and asthenia in 1 patient). 
All Cycles  
Across all cycles of the Phase 2/3 studies (including cycle 1, the overall subject incidence of serious TEAEs 
was 6.3%, with similar incidences being noted among patients treated with netupitant-palonosetron (6.0%; 
87/1442), palonosetron (6.2%; 99/1600), and aprepitant+5-HT3 (8.0%; 19/238). Overall, a similar pattern 
is seen for  all cycles compared to cycle 1; serious  TEAEs were most commonly (≥ 1% overall incidence) 
reported within the system organ classes of blood and lymphatic system disorders (2.1%) and GI disorders 
(1.3%). By preferred term, the most frequently (≥ 0.5%) reported serious TEAEs were febrile neutropenia 
(0.9%), neutropenia (0.8%), and anaemia (0.5%), also consistent with cycle 1 data.  
In  addition  to  the  4  patients  in  cycle  1  having  serious  treatment-related  TEAEs,  1  patient  in  the 
netupitant-palonosetron group experienced a treatment-related serious TEAE before her 6th cycle during the 
Phase  2/3  studies  (for  a  total of  5  patients  with  related  serious  TEAEs  during  all  cycles  of  the  Phase  2/3 
studies.  This  patient  experienced  ventricular  extrasystoles  judged  by  the  investigator  to  have  a  probable 
causal relationship with investigational product. 
Phase 3 Multi-cycle Studies  
All Cycles  
The overall subject incidence of SAEs was 6.9% across all cycles of the Phase 3 multi-cycle program, with 
SAEs being reported more frequently for patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group (18.3%) than in the 
netupitant-palonosetron (8.2%) or palonosetron groups (3.3%). In general, the most common SAEs were 
categorised  within  the  system  organ  classes  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (3.1% 
netupitant-palonosetron;  1.1%  palonosetron;  4.8%  aprepitant+palonosetron),  GI  disorders  (1.8% 
netupitant-palonosetron;  0.3%  palonosetron;  3.8%  aprepitant+palonosetron),  and  infections  and 
infestations  (1.5%  netupitant-palonosetron;  0.7%  palonosetron;  3.8%  aprepitant+palonosetron), 
consistent with those expected for a population of patients with cancer receiving multicycle chemotherapy.  
By preferred term, the most common SAEs (≥ 0.3% overall) observed in patients were febrile neutropenia 
(1.2%),  neutropenia  (0.7%),  vomiting  (0.4%),  anaemia  (0.4%),  and  leucopenia  (0.3%).  In  the 
netupitant-palonosetron and palonosetron groups, febrile neutropenia was the most frequently reported SAE 
(1.5% [16/1033] and 0.8% [6/725], respectively), while anaemia was the most frequently reported SAE 
among patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group (2.9%; 3/104). For other individual preferred terms, 
there did not appear to be a pattern observed with respect to the types of SAEs that were reported with 
greater subject incidence, and the low incidence of each of these SAEs across treatment groups precludes 
meaningful comparison.

Deaths 
Of the 3280 patients in the 4 key Phase 2/3 studies in patients with cancer, 39 patients (1.2%) died on-study. 
None of the deaths was considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product, with most of 
the  deaths  being  attributable  to  disease-related  progression  or  to  complications  due  the  toxic  effects  of 
chemotherapy.  
In the Phase 2/3 studies, 28 patients (0.9%) died during cycle 1, and 11 patients died during the remaining 
chemotherapy cycles, as follows:  
• 
In cycle 1, of the 28 patients who died, 20 patients out of 1600 (1.3%) had received either IV or oral 
palonosetron  (19  were  treated  in  single-cycle  Study  PALO-10-01  and  1  in  Study  NETU-08-18);  8 
patients  (of  1442  [0.6%])  had  received  netupitant-palonosetron    and    no  subjects  in  the 
aprepitant+5-HT3 group had a fatal TEAE during cycle 1.  
•  During the remaining cycles (i.e., patients in the Phase 3 multi-cycle studies), 19 patients died (of 
1862 patients treated during the multi-cycle studies [1.0%]). There did not appear to be an influence 
of  repeated  dosing  on  the  incidence  of  fatal  adverse  events,  as  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse 
events resulting in death was similar across chemotherapy cycles (range of incidences: 0.1% [cycle 
2 and cycle 4] to 0.4% [cycle 1 and cycle 6]). Overall, for patients in the Phase 3 multi-cycle studies, 
the  incidence  of  fatal  TEAEs  (across  all  cycles,  1  through  6)  was  generally  comparable  across 
treatment  groups:  TEAEs  resulting  in  death  were  experienced  by  1.5%  of  patients  in  the 
netupitant-palonosetron group, 0.3% of patients in the palonosetron group, and 1.0% of patients in 
aprepitant+palonosetron group.  
In addition to the deaths reported above, there were 5 patients in Study NETU-10-29 who experienced TEAEs 
with a final fatal outcome, but who were not included in the data as on-study deaths: 3 of these patients (2 
in  the  netupitant-palonosetron  group  and  1  in  the  aprepitant+5-HT3  group)  died  after  completion  of  all 
chemotherapy cycles to which they were scheduled (i.e., these patients, per protocol, were considered to 
have  completed  study);  1  patient  withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  an  AE  (which  ultimately  had  a  fatal 
outcome); and 1 patient withdrew from the study due to other reasons (investigator assessment: worsening 
of global health condition) and died a few days after discontinuation.  
Of  the  remaining  patients  in  the  netupitant-palonosetron  clinical  development  programme  (i.e.,  healthy 
volunteers and patients in special population studies), 2 died on-study. Both were cancer patients treated 
with the netupitant/palonosetron FDC (300/0.50 mg) prior to docetaxel chemotherapy in drug-interaction 
Study  NETU-10-09.  Neither  death  was  assessed  by 
the 
investigator  as  being 
related 
to 
netupitant/palonosetron  FDC.  In  the  first  case,  the  patient  (81-year-old  male  with  prostate  cancer)  was 
hospitalised  because  of  dehydration,  neutropenia,  and  pneumonia,  and  died  following  circulatory  and 
respiratory insufficiency associated with pneumonia. The events were considered to be related (possibly and 
definitely) to docetaxel. In the second case, the patient (a 63-year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma) 
was hospitalised after experiencing respiratory failure with dyspnoea, and later died after developing severe 
neutropenia (nonserious) and pulmonary oedema. The death was attributed to progression of lung cancer, 
and was not considered to be related to docetaxel or to investigational product.  
The most frequent preferred terms in the Phase 2/3 patients who died during the Phase 2/3 studies (n=39) 
were  multi-organ  failure  (5  patients),  death  (4  patients),  acute  cardiac  failure,  cardiopulmonary  failure, 
pneumonia and renal failure (3 patients each). There were 17 deaths in the netupitant-palonosetron groups 
(17/1442), 21 deaths in palonosetron-treated groups (21/1600; of which 9/1231 in the palonosetron oral 
group) and 1 death in the active comparator groups (1/238).

Laboratory findings 
Routine laboratory tests included haematology and chemistry at screening, day 2 and day 6 of each cycle 
during  the  Phase  3  multi-cycle  studies.  Troponin  concentrations  (cTnI)  were  measured  at  the  same  time 
points in the two multi-cycle Phase 3 studies.  
As  expected,  in  patients  receiving  chemotherapy  over  multiple  cycles,  leucopenia  (including  neutropenia, 
monocytopenia and granulocytopenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia were observed with generally similar 
reductions  in  patients  receiving  netupitant-palonosetron,  palonosetron  or  aprepitant+palonosetron.  There 
was  no apparent influence of repeat exposure to investigational product on haematology parameters. No 
clinically  meaningful  differences  in  haematology  were  observed between  the  treatment  groups  after  both 
single cycle and multiple cycle exposure.  
During all cycles, the most frequently reported (> 5.0% overall) marked laboratory abnormalities among 
subjects  in  the  netupitant-palonosetron,  palonosetron,  and  aprepitant+palonosetron  groups  were 
hyperglycaemia  (8.4%,  7.6%,  and  6.7%,  respectively)  and  hyponatraemia  (5.5%,  6.3%,  and  6.7%). 
Hyperglycaemia was reported as a TEAE for 119 (of 1862 [6.4%]) patients in the Phase 3 multi-cycle studies 
(6.1% of patients in the netupitant-palonosetron group; 7.3% of patients in the palonosetron group; and 
2.9% of patients in the aprepitant+palonosetron group).

There  were  no  obvious  trends  indicative  of  treatment-related  effects  on  chemistry  parameters  across  all 
treatment groups.  
A total of 58 patients (3.1%) had post dose cTnI elevations ≥ 0.12 ng/mL during these Phase 3 multi-cycle 
studies which included 33 patients (3.2%) in the netupitant-palonosetron FDC group, 22 patients (3.0%) in 
the palonosetron group, and 3 patients (2.9%) in the aprepitant+palonosetron group . The majority of cTnI 
elevations were seen in cycle 5 or 6.

Pregnancy  
As of the cut-off date of 30 June 2013, two cases of exposed pregnancy occurred during the FDC development 
program. One female healthy volunteer treated with 600 mg netupitant and 1.50 mg palonosetron (Study 
NETU-07-20) had a positive serum pregnancy test at the final visit. The entire gestation was uneventful and 
the woman gave birth to a normal newborn. The second subject was treated with the FDC (300/0.50 mg) in 
a bioequivalence study (NETU-11-02). The pregnancy was uneventful, delivery was without complications, 
and the newborn was healthy. 
Vital Signs  
Vital  signs  included  the  monitoring  of  blood  pressure  (systolic  and  diastolic)  and  pulse  rate  and  were 
measured at screening for each cycle plus pre-dose, 5, 24, and 120 hours post-dose at each cycle.  
After  the  start  of  chemotherapy,  mean  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures  were  slightly  lower  in  all 
treatment  groups  during  cycle  1  compared  to  baseline;  however,  these  changes  were  not  clinically 
meaningful. There were no patterns or trends over time in vital signs during the Phase 3 multi-cycle studies, 
and none of the results appeared to be indicative of a clinical concern. There was little variability in mean 
blood pressure values over time. 
Safety in special populations 
For the multi-cycle Phase 3 studies, patients with varying degrees of renal impairment were evaluated for 
safety including TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and ECGs. In addition TEAEs and serious TEAEs are further analysed 
by the intrinsic factors of gender, age class, race, and region. The extrinsic factor of emetogenicity (i.e., HEC 
and  MEC)  is  analysed  using  both  the  Phase  2/3  cancer  patient  population  and  the  multi-cycle  Phase  3 
patients. 
Renal impairment 
Per protocol patients were qualified for enrolment provided that serum creatinine was equal to or less than 
1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance was ≥ 60 mL/min. The multi-cycle Phase 3 studies did not enrol patients 
with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and included more patients with normal 
renal function ([creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/min] 1198/1862, 64.3%) than patients with either mild renal 
impairment ([creatinine clearance ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min] 580/1862, 31.1%) or moderate renal impairment 
([creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min] 80/1862, 4.3%). This difference is consistently seen in all the 
treatment groups: in the netupitant-palonosetron group there are 668 normal renal function patients, 317 
mild renal impairment patients, and 45 moderate renal impairment patients; in the palonosetron group the 
patients are 476, 218, and 30, respectively; and in the aprepitant+palonosetron group they are 54, 45, and 
5, respectively. No clear difference was observed in the incidence of TEAEs or ECG parameters for patients 
with normal renal function compared to those of patients with mild and moderate renal impairment in the 
Phase 3 multicycle studies.  
The  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  1  TEAE  was  similar  in  the  3  renal  function  subgroups  for  each 
treatment group, with the most commonly reported TEAEs in each subgroup reflecting those in the overall 
safety population. In addition, the percentage of cycles during which patients experienced any TEAE was 
similar across the renal function subgroups for each treatment group.  
Changes in ECGs during the Phase 3 multicentre studies were small and generally larger in the mild and 
moderate renal impairment subgroups than in patients with normal renal function although the small number 
of patients in the moderate renal impairment subgroup makes comparison difficult. Few patients had outlier 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 136/153 
 
  
  
  
values for QTcF > 480 ms or > 500 ms, and no clear pattern in the incidence of outliers could be seen across 
the renal subgroups in any treatment group. 
Gender 
The  multi-cycle  Phase  3  studies  included  more  female  patients  (1628/1862,  87.4%)  than  male  patients 
(234/1862, 12.6%). This imbalance is mainly driven by the safety population in Study NETU-08-18 (which 
compared  netupitant-palonosetron  and  palonosetron)  which  was  primarily  comprised  of  females 
(1422/1450, 98.1%), with a minority (28/1450, 1.9%) of males, due to the protocol-specified chemotherapy 
regimen (MEC, AC/EC) mostly indicated for breast cancer. As a consequence, this difference is seen in both 
the netupitant-palonosetron group (866 females, 167 males) and the palonosetron group (711 females, 14 
males), while the aprepitant+palonosetron group, which comprises patients from Study NETU-10-29 only, 
had a similar number of females (51) and males (53).  
The percentage of patients with at least 1 TEAE considering all cycles was slightly lower in the male subgroup 
than the female subgroup overall (85.5% and 90.3%, respectively), with the most commonly reported TEAEs 
in males and in females reflecting those in the overall safety population. 
Age 
The multi-cycle Phase 3 studies included more patients with < 65 years (1519/1862, 81.6%) than patients 
with ≥ 65 year (343/1862, 18.4%). As detailed below, the percentage of patients with at least 1 TEAE during 
any cycle was comparable in the subgroups of patients < 65 years of age and patients ≥ 65 years of age 
overall  (89.3%,  1356/1519  patients  and  91.5%,  314/343  patients,  respectively)  and 
in  the 
netupitant-palonosetron group (89.3%, 749/839 patients vs. 94.8%, 184/194 patients, respectively), with 
the most commonly reported TEAEs in each of the  2 age subgroups reflecting those in the overall safety 
population. Almost all the patients included in the multi-cycle Phase 3 studies were < 75 years (1821/1862, 
97.8%) and only a minority (41/1862, 2.2%) was ≥ 75 years of age. Therefore, the number of patients in the 
subgroup ≥ 75 years of age was too small to allow a meaningful comparison with the other group. 
Emetogenicity 
The percentage of patients with at least 1 TEAE overall was higher in the MEC subgroup than in the HEC 
subgroup during cycle 1 and all cycles both overall and in each of the treatment groups. It should be noted 
that  for  the  “all  cycles”  population,  where  the  difference  is  observed  as  well,  the  HEC  subgroup  (1518 
patients) is comprised of 1418 patients from NETU-07-07 and PALO-10-01 (cycle 1 only). In the analysis of 
cycles with TEAEs, the percentage of cycles during which patients experienced any TEAE was higher in MEC 
patients than HEC patients in each treatment group. Within each subgroup (MEC and HEC), no differences 
were seen between the treatment groups in the proportion of patients with TEAEs.  
The differences in the types and incidence of TEAEs between the MEC and HEC subgroups are considered to 
reflect the differences between the chemotherapy regimens and potentially the mix of patients (primarily 
women in the MEC-AC group) in these subgroups. The difference in the incidence of events in cycle 1 may be 
partially explained by the difference in the toxicity pattern of the MEC and HEC regimens, with MEC mainly 
affecting the bone marrow with a nadir between 7-14 days post chemotherapy, while HEC toxicity primarily 
targets the kidney and has a cumulative effect on renal function. Also in cycle 1, the incidence of alopecia may 
have contributed to the difference between the MEC and HEC subgroups, being reported in cycle 1 by 31% of 
MEC patients and 1.5% of HEC patients, and may reflect the different proportion of female patients receiving 
an  AC-based  regimen  for  breast  cancer,  known  to  cause  greater  incidence  of  more  severe 
chemotherapy-induced alopecia compared with cisplatin.  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 137/153 
 
  
  
  
The percentage of patients with serious TEAEs,  however, is  higher in the HEC subgroup than in the  MEC 
subgroup  in  cycle  1  (5.4%  vs  2.4%)  and  similar  in  the  2  subgroups  in  all  cycles  (6.1%  and  6.4%).  This 
suggests that in cycle 1 HEC patients reported fewer TEAEs, but they experienced more serious events. 
ECG 
For cycle 1 in the Phase 2/3 cancer patients, an analysis of ECG data showed that at 5 hours after treatment 
(approximate Tmax for netupitant/palonosetron FDC), a comparable increase from baseline in QTcF was seen 
in the netupitant-palonosetron group, the palonosetron group, and the comparator group. Similar changes 
from baseline in QTcF values were also observed at 24 hours post dose with mean QTcF values returning to 
baseline values or lower at 120 hours after treatment. At subsequent cycles,  in the multi-cycle studies a 
similar pattern was observed, with comparable changes from the same-cycle pre-dose reference values for 
each treatment group.  
An outlier analysis showed that the proportion of patients with QTcF increases from baseline to >500 ms was 
low in the netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron and comparator groups in cycle 1 of the Phase 2/3 studies. 
In the multi-cycle studies, considering all cycles, the percentage of patients who had new QTcF interval values 
> 500 ms was low and comparable between treatment groups (1.1% in the netupitant-palonosetron group, 
0.8% in the palonosetron group, and 1.0% in the comparator group). Moreover, the proportion of patients 
with QTcF increases of >60 ms from baseline or same cycle pre-dose was also low and comparable in the 
netupitant-palonosetron group and in the palonosetron at each cycle. The lower proportion of patients with 
QTcF increases of > 60 ms in the comparator arm is likely related to the reduced pro-arrhythmic potential of 
the  chemotherapeutic  agents  used  in  study  NETU-10-29.  No  increased  risk  of  clinically  relevant  QT 
prolongation is expected after the administration of netupitant/palonosetron FDC.  
Outlier  responses  in  QTc  interval  are  difficult  to  assess  in  view  of  normal  intra-individual  and  circadian 
variability in this parameter. Recommended assessment criteria that could indicate a potential safety signal 
include a change in QTcF from baseline to > 500 msec in more than 5% of patients and from baseline of > 60 
msec in more than 15% of patients (Morganroth et al. 2010). 
In cycle 1, the percentage of patients with new treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities after baseline was 
comparable  between  the  treatment  groups  (37.5%,  37.4%,  and  39.1%  in  the  netupitant-palonosetron, 
palonosetron,  and  aprepitant  +palonosetron  groups,  respectively).  The  most  frequently  reported  new 
treatment-emergent  ECG  abnormalities  were  flat  T-wave  (11.3%  overall)  followed  by  sinus  tachycardia 
(9.2% overall), both of which occurred in similar percentages of patients across the treatment groups. In the 
subgroup  of  patients  who  received  at  least  6  consecutive  cycles  of  the  same  treatment  in  the  Phase  3 
multicycle studies, the overall frequency of new treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities tended to increase 
by cycle in the netupitant-palonosetron group and the palonosetron group from cycle 1 (36.6% [116/317 
patients]  and  40.3%  [77/191  patients],  respectively)  to  cycle  5  (50.8%  [161/317  patients]  and  52.4% 
[100/191 patients], respectively). The frequency of new U-waves was low (0.50%) and comparable across 
the treatment groups.  
Study NETU-07-20 was a double-blind randomised parallel-group trial to investigate possible ECG effects of 
single oral doses of netupitant/palonosetron using a clinical and a supratherapeutic dose compared to placebo 
and moxifloxacin (a positive control) in healthy men and women (a thorough QT study).  
The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  administration  of  netupitant  in  combination  with 
palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval more than placebo in male and female healthy subjects.  
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 138/153 
 
  
  
  
Subjects were males and females between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive), in good physical health, and 
with a body mass index ≥19 and <29 kg/m2.  
The study was conducted in compliance of ICH E14 guidance and the primary endpoint was to determine the 
effect of the combination on QTc interval as corrected by individually derived heart rate correction factor.  
There were 4 treatment groups:  
1.  Placebo to netupitant and placebo to palonosetron  
2.  200 mg netupitant and 0.50 mg palonosetron  
3.  600 mg netupitant and 1.50 mg palonosetron  
4.  400 mg moxifloxacin  
The  time  matched  analysis  for  the  QTcI  endpoint  revealed  that  the  moxifloxacin  group  met  the  assay 
sensitivity criteria with 12 time points > mean of 5 msec. The time matched results for QTcI, QTcF and QTcB 
showed  that  at  no  time  point  did  palonosetron  and  netupitant  dose  groups  exceed  the  upper  confidence 
interval of 10 msec. As far as the effect on QTcI interval is concerned, the changes observed were considered 
to  be  random  changes  consistent  with  spontaneous  variability  in  QTc  interval  and  not  to  indicate  a 
pharmacological  effect  due  to  the  administration  of  netupitant/palonosetron  combination.  This  conclusion 
was supported by a lack of dose-response or concentration-response relationship and overall, the results of 
this ECG trial showed no signal of any effect on AV conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by the 
PR and QRS interval durations. 
No statistical or experimental evidence was found to demonstrate any potential relationship for corrected QT 
interval  or  QT  intervals  with  plasma  palonosetron  concentrations  after  single  dose  administration  of 
intravenous palonosetron including supratherapeutic doses up to 2.25 mg, 9-fold greater than the current 
marketed 0.25 mg intravenous dose. 
The expert cardiologist notes that following the first cycle, mean increases in QTc intervals at 5 hours and 24 
hours were very small (< 12 msec) and within normal limits. These increases were comparable for the three 
treatments administered (namely, the FDC, palonosetron alone or a comparator combination). The number 
of outliers with significant categorical responses (QTc interval > 500 msec or an increase from baseline of > 
60  msec)  was  very  low  (maximum  0.6%)  and  consistent  with  what  would  be  observed  normally  in  such 
populations.  
Hepatic Change 
The  applicant  performed  an  analysis  for  netupitant-palonosetron  to  cause  severe  liver  toxicity  (DILI)  to 
assess the potential of hepatotoxic signals induced by patients’ exposure to treatment. Such an analysis of 
the  potential  was  undertaken  in  the  Phase  3  multi-cycle  clinical  trials.  Overall,  the  analysis  of  all  cases 
described in an expert review indicated that exposure to netupitant and palonosetron was not associated with 
the development of severe liver injury. The diagnostic profile was mainly represented by mild hepatocellular 
liver  injury.  All  patients  recovered  or  improved  and  no  patients  discontinued  the  study  because  of 
hepatoxicity.  The  main  confounding  factor  in  the  occurrence  of  liver  events  is  chemotherapy,  which 
represents a known cause of liver injury. Data from the FDC development program do not suggest a particular 
risk of hepatotoxicity associated with netupitant-palonosetron FDC exposure after single or repeated cycles of 
chemotherapy.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Netupitant is a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). Studies 
have shown that when a CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) was administered with netupitant, approximately 
2-fold  increases  in  netupitant  exposure  were  observed.  Likewise,  coadministration  of  a  CYP3A4  inducer 
(rifampicin) resulted in a 5- to 6-fold reduction in netupitant exposure (NETU-10-11).  
Based on pharmacokinetic interaction studies performed during the development program, administration of 
the FDC with CYP3A4 substrates may result in increased exposure to the substrate. Exposure to midazolam, 
erythromycin,  dexamethasone,  docetaxel,  etoposide,  and  levonorgestrel  were  all  increased  during 
coadministration  with  netupitant.  These  additional  studies  indicate  that  netupitant  is  a  mild  to  moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 (NP16599, NETU-06-07, NETU-10-08, NETU-10-09).  
The PK of netupitant was not affected by CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, midazolam, dexamethasone, or 
oral contraceptives. Furthermore, mean netupitant PK parameters obtained in each of the 3 chemotherapy 
groups (administered with docetaxel, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide) after netupitant/palonosetron FDC 
co-administration were not essentially different.  
Netupitant  does  not  influence  the  exposure  of  digoxin,  a  P-glycoprotein  substrate  (NETU-07-01). 
Nevertheless a slight increase of digoxin Cmax (9%) was observed. Netupitant also has no effect on the PK of 
palonosetron (NETU-06-27).

Of the 3280 patients with cancer treated in the Phase 2/3 studies, 24 (0.7%) reported AEs during cycle 1 that 
resulted  in  withdrawal  from  the  study.  Of  these  AEs,  those  that  were  reported  for  >  1  patient  were 
neutropenia  (3/1169  patients  [0.3%])  in  the  netupitant-palonosetron  300/0.50  mg  group,  and  nausea 
(2/1231 patients [0.2%]) in the palonosetron 0.50 mg group. Four subjects (0.1%) experienced AEs leading 
to withdrawal from the study that, in the opinion of the investigator, were related to investigational product. 
Of these patients, 2 (of 1442 [0.1%]) had received netupitant-palonosetron (AEs of loss of consciousness and 
acute psychosis [both serious]), and 2 (of 1600 [0.1%]) had received palonosetron 0.50 mg only (AEs of 
nausea and urticaria) 
All Cycles  
Seventy-seven (2.3%) patients reported TEAEs during any chemotherapy cycle of the Phase 2/3 studies that 
led to these patients being withdrawn from studies, with the greatest incidence of subject withdrawals being 
in the aprepitant+5-HT3 group (5.5%; 13/238) compared with the netupitant-palonosetron groups (3.1%; 
44/1442) or palonosetron group (1.3%; 20/1600). 
By preferred term, the most frequently (≥ 0.2% overall) reported events leading to withdrawal from the 
study, regardless of seriousness and relationship, that occurred during any cycle (including cycle 1) were 
neutropenia (0.2%), malignant neoplasm (0.2%), and neoplasm progression (0.2%). Treatment-emergent 
AEs leading to withdrawal from the study that were reported for > 2 patients in any group were neutropenia 
(0.3% [5/1442]), neoplasm progression (0.3% [5/1442]), and malignant neoplasm (0.3% [4/1442]) in the 
netupitant-palonosetron  groups;  and  nausea  (3  patients  [0.2%])  in  the  palonosetron  group.  In  the 
aprepitant+5-HT3  group,  the  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  were 
thrombocytopenia, ileus, peritonitis, blood creatinine increased, and malignant neoplasms, occurring at an 
incidence of 2 patients each (of 238 [0.8%]).  
Of the 77 patients with cancer in the Phase 2/3 studies who experienced TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the 
study, 6 (0.2%) had TEAEs during any cycle that were considered by the investigator to be related to the 
investigational product ( 2 subjects (0.1%) treated with netupitant-palonosetron combinations who reported 
one AE each of loss of consciousness and acute psychosis; and 4 subjects (0.3%) treated with palonosetron 
0.50  mg  who  reported  one  AE  each  of  nausea,  electrocardiogram  repolarisation  abnormality,  pharyngeal 
oedema, and urticaria.  
Post marketing experience 
At the time of submission the netupitant-palonosetron FDC was not marketed in any country.  
More than 5.8 million vials of intravenous palonosetron (CINV and PONV) have been sold worldwide in the 
period July 2013-July 2014, corresponding to approximately 886'500 patients exposed to the injectable 
formulation for the CINV indication and 555’400 for the PONV indication.  A total of 58'000 capsules have 
been sold during the same period, corresponding to approximately 9'700 patients exposed. 
Recently the European Medicines Agency (EMA) indicated that the potential for serotonin syndrome across 
the class of 5-HT3  antagonists exists and this represents a possible safety concern; consequently, the EU 
SmPC of Aloxi was amended to reflect the potential risk. This was also taken into consideration for Akynzeo. 
Other than the potential for serotonin syndrome, no new important identified and potential risks for 
palonosetron have been identified in addition to those already reported in the EU-RMP (severe 
hypersensitivity reactions, severe constipation, QT prolongation and convulsion), which are under a 
continuous monitoring and in-depth evaluation. 
EMA/236963/2015

 During the reporting period no marketing authorisation renewals or registration applications were rejected, 
and no marketing authorisations were withdrawn or suspended for safety reasons. No actions were taken due 
to product defects and quality issues. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical  safety  was  assessed  through  the  4  pivotal  studies  that  were  performed  in  the  target  population: 
prevention of CINV in patient receiving HEC or MEC. The study population was predominantly white (86.0%), 
and had a mean (SD) age of 54.5 (10.4) years. 
A  total  of  1538  subjects  and  patients  were  exposed  to  the  netupitant-palonosetron  combination  at  the 
proposed market dose (300/0.50 mg) during the clinical programme with a total number of 5441 exposures: 
1169 patients with cancer received at least one dose while participating in one of the Phase 2/3 studies. There 
were 550 patients who received 6 or more consecutive cycles of chemotherapy and 317 of these received the 
FDC (300/0.50 mg). 
Adverse reactions were compared across netupitant-palonosetron (1442 patients) and palonosetron (1600 
patients) and comparator groups (238). Common adverse reactions reported with Akynzeo were headache 
(3.6%),  constipation  (3.0%)  and  fatigue  (1.2%).    None  of  these  events  was  serious.  The  frequency  of 
headache, constipation and fatigue was similar (2.9%, 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively) in patients receiving 
oral palonosetron 0.5 mg alone. 
Cases of severe constipation and of complications due to constipation were observed in the clinical trials and, 
in accordance with the product information on Aloxi (palonosetron), information included in the SmPC and in 
the RMP as an important identified risk.  
For  cycle  1,  the  frequencies  of  patients  reporting  TEAEs  were  similar  across  the  total  (all  doses) 
netupitant-palonosetron,  palonosetron,  and  comparator  groups,  except  for  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders, which were reported less frequently in the total comparator group (7.1%, 17/238 patients) than in 
the  total  netupitant-palonosetron  (22.3%,  321/1442  patients)  and  total  palonosetron  groups  (17.9%, 
286/1600 patients); and blood and lymphatic system disorders, which were also reported less frequently in 
the  total  comparator  group  (13.9%,  33/238  patients)  than  in  the  total  netupitant-palonosetron  (24.5%, 
353/1442 patients) and total palonosetron groups (20.6%, 330/1600 patients). Whereas the incidence of 
certain adverse reactions such as leucopenia or alopecia seemed to increased with dose of the FDC in the 
Phase  2/3  combined  safety  population  for  Cycle  1  this  could  not  be  shown  in  study  NETU-07-07  where 
frequency  and  severity  of  TEAEs  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  without  indication  of 
dose-dependence.  It  is  acknowledged  that,  unlike  in  the  combined  safety  population  NETU-07-07  study 
included similar numbers and types of cancer patients at each netupitant dose level but, considering that 
netupitant is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor  precautionary statements were included into the SmPC to monitor 
patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for CYP3A4 for possible increased toxicity. 
SAE profiles shown in the clinical trial programme were consistent with the patient population and the fact 
that they were undergoing chemotherapy. The overall subject incidence of SAEs was 6.9% across all cycles 
of  the  Phase  3  multi-cycle  programme,  with  SAEs  being  reported  more  frequently  for  patients  in  the 
aprepitant+palonosetron group (18.3%) than in the netupitant-palonosetron (8.2%) or palonosetron groups 
(3.3%). In general, the most common SAEs were categorised within the system organ classes of blood and

infections  and 
infestations  (1.5%  netupitant-palonosetron;  0.7% 
palonosetron; 3.8% aprepitant+palonosetron), all of which might be seen in a population of patients with 
cancer receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. By preferred term, the most common SAEs (≥ 0.3% overall) 
observed  in  patients  were  febrile  neutropenia  (1.2%),  neutropenia  (0.7%),  vomiting  (0.4%),  anaemia 
(0.4%), and leucopenia (0.3%). In the netupitant-palonosetron and palonosetron groups, febrile neutropenia 
was the most frequently reported SAE (1.5% [16/1033] and 0.8% [6/725], respectively). 
A  total  of  46  cancer  patients  who  participated  in  the  clinical  development  programme  died;  41  deaths 
occurred during the treatment period (39 in the Phase 2/3 trials and 2 in the PK interaction study); 5 patients 
died  after  their  participation  in  study  NETU-10-29.  None  of  the  deaths  was  considered  related  to  study 
medication.  Both  the  frequency  and  the  nature  of  deaths  are  considered  consistent  with  what  would  be 
expected in the population enrolled and with disease related progression or complications of cytotoxic effects 
of chemotherapy.  
Leucopenia (including neutropenia, monocytopenia and granulocytopenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia 
were observed with generally similar reductions in patients receiving netupitant-palonosetron, palonosetron 
or aprepitant+palonosetron. There was no apparent influence of repeat exposure to investigational product 
on haematology parameters. No clinically meaningful differences in haematology were observed between the 
treatment groups after both single cycle and multiple cycle exposure. There were no obvious trends indicative 
of treatment-related effects on chemistry parameters across all treatment groups. 
There  was  a  low  incidence  of  withdrawal  due  to  adverse  events.  Overall,  seventy-seven  (2.3%)  patients 
reported  TEAEs  during  any  chemotherapy  cycle  of  the  Phase  2/3  studies  that  led to  withdrawal  from  the 
study, a total of 44 patients in the netupitant-palonosetron groups (3.1%), 20 in the palonosetron group 
(1.3%) and 13 (5.5%) in the aprepitant+5-HT3 group. The adverse events causing withdrawal is considered 
to reflect the condition being treated and the adverse events of associated chemotherapy.  
Subgroup analyses based on renal function, age, gender, race, region and emetogenicity (HEC or MEC) did 
not  reveal  any  statistically  significant  differences  that  would  require  special  consideration.  Adverse  event 
profiles across the subgroups evaluated reflected those in the overall safety population. 
The percentage of patients with at least one TEAE overall was higher in the MEC subgroup compared to HEC 
during cycle 1 and all cycles both overall and in each of the treatment groups and it is agreed that this may 
reflect the different toxicities of chemotherapy regimens.  
A thorough ECG trial demonstrated that netupitant and palonosetron had no clinically important effects on 
heart rate, PR and QRS interval duration or cardiac morphology. The effects on cardiac repolarization by any 
of the ECG data analyses including a careful pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic analysis also showed no 
netupitant/palonosetron effects on cardiac repolarization. No statistical or experimental evidence was found 
to demonstrate any potential relationship for corrected QT interval or QT intervals with plasma palonosetron 
concentrations after single dose administration of intravenous palonosetron including supratherapeutic doses 
up to 2.25 mg, 9-fold greater than the current marketed 0.25 mg intravenous dose. 
Following the first cycle, mean increases in QTc intervals at 5 hours and 24 hours were very small (< 12 
msec)  and  within  normal  limits.  These  increases  were  comparable  for  the  three  treatments  administered 
(namely, the FDC, palonosetron alone or a comparator combination). The number of outliers with significant 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 144/153 
 
  
  
  
categorical responses (QTc interval > 500 msec or an increase from baseline of > 60 msec) was very low 
(maximum 0.6%) and consistent with what would be observed normally in such populations.  
Nevertheless  the  magnitude  of  the  QT  prolongation  observed  (5  to  7  ms  in  healthy  volunteers)  might 
translate into more profound effects in patients vomiting, with diarrhoea, treated with other drugs susceptible 
to  increase  QT  interval,  with  cardiac  conditions  (heart  failure…)  or  similar  problems  which  decrease  their 
repolarisation reserve. Therefore, as with other 5HT3 receptor antagonists a precautionary statement was in 
included into section 4.4 of the SmPC and identified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
In vitro data demonstrated that netupitant is a P-gp inhibitor. In a study performed in healthy volunteers, 
netupitant did not affect the exposure of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, whereas it significantly increases its Cmax 
(by 9%).Clinically this effect may be relevant notably in female patients in whom the therapeutic margin for 
digoxin is narrower than in men. Furthermore, netupitant will be administered to patients the renal status of 
whom would be probably altered either due to the age and/or to chemotherapy (e.g.cisplatin). As it cannot be 
ruled out that digoxin exposure may increase in a significant manner in the clinical setting a precautionary 
statement to the use of P-gp substrates was implemented in the SmPC and this was added as an important 
potential risk due to netupitant into the RMP. 
Based on the current SmPC, palonosetron is not expected to be an inhibitor and an inducer of CYPs. However, 
since the granting of the MA for palonosetron, a new EU Guideline on drug-drug Interactions was published 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1; came into effect January 2013). The investigation of the involvement of efflux 
and uptake transporters in the interaction profile of a new drug entity is now strongly recommended. No data 
of such feature was submitted therefore the applicant is recommended to carry out an additional in vitro 
study evaluating the involvement of efflux and uptake transporters in palonosetron disposition and its effect 
as an inhibitor of these transporters by the end of March 2016. 
From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been  included  in  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  the  FDC  was  well  tolerated.  Many  adverse  reactions  are  likely  to  be  associated  with  either  the 
underlying  condition  or  associated  cytotoxic  therapies.  Similarly  SAEs  and  deaths  reflect  the  patient 
population and concurrent treatment. The known PK interaction of netupitant with CYP3A4, which might be 
associated  with  an  increase  in  the  exposure  to  chemotherapy  agents  metabolised  via  this  pathway  is 
adequately addressed in SmPC and RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Within a pivotal study with cancer patients receiving cisplatin based regimen (NETU-07-07) the applicant 
could show for the primary endpoint “proportion of patients with complete response in the overall phase” 
statistical superiority in favour of netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron (p=0.004). The difference versus oral 
palonosetron 0.5 mg alone, which is already marketed in the EU, ranked in the order of 13.2%, which can be 
considered clinically meaningful. The percentage of patients in the MFAS with delayed CR was 80.1% in the 
palonosetron alone group and 90.4% in the netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron group. The contribution of 
netupitant in the 25-120 hour time period (delayed phase) can therefore be considered demonstrated. 
In  the  second  pivotal  study  (NETU-08-18)  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  netupitant  plus  palonosetron  versus 
palonosetron alone in breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or epirubicin 
the primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of patients with CR in the delayed phase at cycle 1) during the first 
chemotherapy  cycle  was  higher  in  the  combination  group  (76.9%)  than  the  palonosetron  alone  group 
(69.5%), with a difference from the palonosetron alone group of 7.4% which can be considered a clinically 
relevant  difference.  The  superiority  of  netupitant/palonosetron  to  palonosetron  alone  was  demonstrated 
(CMH  OR:  1.47  with  95%  CI  from  1.17  to  1.85;  p=0.001).  Key  secondary  endpoints,  the  proportion  of 
patients  with  CR  in  the  acute  phase  was  3.4%  higher  in  the  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  than  in  the 
palonosetron alone group (88.4% vs. 85.0%; from CMH test: OR: 1.37, p=0.047) and in the overall phase 
the  CR  rate  was  7.7%  higher  in  the  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  than  in  the  palonosetron  alone  group 
(74.3% vs. 66.6%; from CMH test: OR: 1.47, p=0.001). In general, the results of the secondary endpoints 
consistently supported those of the primary and key secondary endpoints for the delayed and overall phases. 
The multiple-cycle extension phase confirmed these results showing CR rates being consistently higher for 
the  netupitant/palonosetron  FDC  than  for  palonosetron  alone  in  each  phase  up  to  cycle  6.  Similarly,  the 
percentage of patients with no significant nausea was higher in the netupitant/palonosetron group than the 
palonosetron group in each phase and each cycle up to cycle 6. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The  pivotal  efficacy  trial  in  the  MEC  setting  (NETU-08-18)  almost  exclusively  recruited  patents  with  a 
diagnosis  of  breast  cancer  treated  with  an  anthracycline  plus  cyclophosphamide  (AC).  Recently  clinical 
antiemetic  guidelines  have  given  special  consideration  to  patient-related  risk  factors  contributing  to  the 
emetogenic  potential  for  patients  receiving  AC-based  chemotherapy  rather  than  solely  based  on  the 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 149/153 
 
  
  
  
emetogenicity  of  the  chemotherapy.  The  young  age  and  female  gender  of  the  population  that  typically 
received  AC-based  chemotherapy  may  put  this  group  at  an  increased  risk  for  CINV  over  what  AC 
chemotherapy  alone  would  suggest.  Nevertheless  it  is  taken  into  consideration  by  the  CHMP  that  AC 
chemotherapy has previously served as gold standard of the MEC regimen in antiemetic efficacy pivotal trials’ 
being a “worst-case” emetogenicity representative for MEC chemotherapy and this model is considered to be 
familiar to clinicians for use to prevent CINV induced by MEC. The indication in the prevention of acute and 
delayed nausea and vomiting in MEC is therefore considered to be appropriately supported by this clinical 
trial. Nevertheless relevant information for the prescriber about regimen and study population of this trial was 
included into the SmPC to highlight this extrapolation of efficacy results. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Common adverse reactions reported with Akynzeo were headache (3.6%), constipation (3.0%) and fatigue 
(1.2%).  None of these events was serious. The frequency of headache, constipation and fatigue was similar 
(2.9%, 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively) in patients receiving oral palonosetron 0.5 mg alone. 
TEAEs most commonly reported were in  blood and lymphatic system disorders and skin and subcutaneous 
tissue  disorders  and  appeared  to  occur  more  frequently  in  comparison  to  the  comparator  groups 
(palonosetron, aprepitant + ondansetron). Overall, the FDC was well tolerated and many adverse reactions 
are likely to be associated with either the underlying condition or associated cytotoxic therapies. Similarly 
SAEs and deaths reflected the patient population and concurrent treatment.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  FDC  demonstrated  teratogenic  potential  in  animals  showing  an  increased  incidence  of  some  foetal 
malformations.  Considering  that  alternative  treatment  options  are  available,  the  use  of  Akynzeo  during 
pregnancy was contraindicated and teratogenicity added as a potential risk to the RMP. Furthermore women 
with childbearing potential must use effective contraception during use of akynzeo as described in the SmPC. 
Almost all patients included in the multi-cycle Phase 3 studies were < 75 years (1821/1862, 97.8%) and only 
a minority (41/1862, 2.2%) was ≥ 75 years of age. Since also hepatic impairment led to a longer half-life of 
the  active  substances  and  since  in  elderly  subjects  the  exposure  to  netupitant  and  palonosetron  was 
increased compared to younger adults, precautionary statements on the limited experience in this patient 
population were added to the SmPC.  
Netupitant increased exposure to docetaxel (increased AUC 0-t by 37% and C max by 50%). Exposure was 
also increased to a lesser extent for etoposide (AUC0-t 21%, no change in Cmax). For cyclophosphamide mean 
increase in exposure ranged from 8 to 14%. As increased chemotherapy toxicities following administration of 
netupitant cannot be completely ruled out with orally administered active substances that are metabolised 
primarily  through  CYP3A4  and  with  a  narrow  therapeutic  range  precautionary  statements  for  possible 
increased  toxicity  were  added  to  the  product  information  to  monitor  patients  for  increased  toxicity  of 
chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for CYP3A4.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Nausea and vomiting are among the side effects associated with cancer treatment. If nausea and vomiting 
are  not  controlled  in  a  cancer  patient,  serious  metabolic  problems  such  as  fluid  and  electrolyte  balance 
disturbances and nutritional status deficiencies can develop. Psychological problems associated with nausea 
and vomiting may include anxiety and depression. In addition, uncontrolled nausea and vomiting may also 
lead to the decision by the physician to reduce chemotherapy dose intensity or to the wish by the patient to 
stop potentially beneficial cancer therapy. The applicant showed within a pivotal study with cancer patients 
receiving HEC clinical meaningful results of the FDC  compared to palonosetron alone in the proportion of 
patients  with  complete  response  in  the  overall  and  delayed  phase.  The  additional  action  of  netupitant  in 
particular on the delayed phase was demonstrated. 
In a second study in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and either doxorubicin or epirubicin the percentage 
of patients with CR in the delayed phase at cycle 1 was 7.4% higher for the FDC compared to palonosetron 
alone giving proof of efficacy in MEC. Efficacy results were generaly supported by the seconday enpoints. The 
multiple-cycle extension phase confirmed these results showing CR rates being consistently higher for the 
netupitant/palonosetron FDC than for palonosetron alone in each phase up to cycle 6.  
Unfavourable effects observed in the clinical trials mainly reflected toxicities of the concurrent chemotherapy 
and no significant or unexpected adverse reactions related to the FDC were noted. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  data  from  the  clinical  development  programme  indicate  that  Akynzeo  is  effective  in  reducing  the 
incidence of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly- and moderately- emetogenic 
chemotherapy, notwithstanding the recent changes to the classification AC based chemotherapy regimens. 
Efficacy was maintained when used in subsequent chemotherapy cycles. 
Akynzeo  showed  a  favourable  safety  profile  with  unfavourable  effects  and  uncertainties  thereof  being 
balanced with the implemented wordings in the product information. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The applicant could demonstrate in two separate pivotal studies efficacy of oral administration of the FDC 
netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron 0.5 mg to prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated 
with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. 
Results  of  the  pivotal  studies  show  a  statistical  superiority  notably  in  terms  of  delayed  emesis  (primary 
endpoint)  of  netupitant  plus  palonosetron  over  palonosetron  alone  in  cancer  patients  receiving  cisplatin 
regimen and a combination of anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide regimen. 
Clinical practice guidelines in oncology recommend that patients receiving HEC regimens or MEC regimens 
with anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide should be treated with a combination of a 5-HT3 RA, NK1 
RA and a systemic corticosteroid. 
The advantages of this fixed-dose combination include an improvement of the benefit/risk due to an addition 
of therapeutic activity of the substances particularly in the delayed phase of emesis. Simplification of therapy 
EMA/236963/2015 
Page 151/153 
 
  
  
  
by  decreasing  the  number  of  individual  dose  units  to  be  taken  by  the  patient  may  simplify  therapy  and 
improve patient compliance.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Akynzeo in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with 
highly emetogenic cisplatin - based cancer chemotherapy and the prevention of acute and delayed nausea 
and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer  chemotherapy  is  favourable  and  therefore

“Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): 
in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or 
•

Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or

TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor 
pathway inhibitor.”

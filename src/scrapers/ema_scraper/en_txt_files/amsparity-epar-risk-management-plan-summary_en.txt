Summary of risk management plan for adalimumab1 
This is a summary of the RMP for Amsparity.  The RMP details important risks of 
Amsparity, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Amsparity risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Amsparity’s SmPC and its PL give essential information to HCPs and patients on how 
adalimumab should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Amsparity should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the EPAR. 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
adalimumab’s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Amsparity is being developed as a biosimilar to the Innovator’s product Humira 
(adalimumab).  Humira was developed and is currently marketed by AbbVie.  Humira is 
authorised in adults for indications RA, PsA, AxSpA, CD, Ps, UC and HS.  Humira is 
authorised in paediatric patients for the treatment of JIA, pedERA, pedCD, pedPs, HS, 
Uveitis, and UC.  Adalimumab is the active substance and it is given by the SC route of 
administration.  Indications for Amsparity are all indications approved for Humira.    
Further information about the evaluation of Amsparity benefits can be found in Amsparity’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s link to product’s EPAR summary landing page:

II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of adalimumab, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about adalimumab's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
• 
•  The authorised pack size-the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly 
1 Changes are considered important if they relate to the following: new safety concerns or important changes/removal 
to a known safety concerns, major changes to the pharmacovigilance plan (e.g. addition of new studies or completion of 
ongoing studies), any ‘additional risk minimisation measure’ which is added or removed, routine risk minimisation activities 
recommending specific clinical measures to address the risk. 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In the case of Amsparity, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
Patient reminder cards for the following important risks: 
•  Serious infections  
•  Tuberculosis  
•  Demyelinating disorders (including MS, GBS, and ON) 
•  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin disease following live BCG vaccination in infants with in 
utero exposure to Amsparity 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of adalimumab is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of adalimumab are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of adalimumab.  Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Risk factors for infection, in general, may include increased age, impaired 
immune function, presence of co-morbidities, and duration of exposure to and 
the number of concomitant immunosuppressive therapies.  Infections that present 
a serious risk to those at advanced age include respiratory infections (eg, 
pneumonia, influenza, and TB), bacteraemia, UTIs, salmonellosis, hepatitis, and 
nosocomial infections.  
While taking adalimumab, the risk for infection might increase, particularly if 
you are over 65 years of age, taking immunosuppressive treatment (eg, 6-MP, 
AZA), a heavy smoker, or have a history of decreased lung function. Infections 
may be serious and, in rare cases, life threatening.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Factors associated with an increased risk of NHL include weakened immune 
system (eg, heritable disease, certain drugs used after an organ transplant), 
infection (eg, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, H. pylori, HTLV-I, and hepatitis C), and 
age (over 60 years).  
Factors associated with an increased risk of HL include weakened immune 
system (eg, heritable disease, certain drugs used after an organ transplant), viral 
infection (eg, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus), and age (among teens and adults aged 15 
to 35 years and adults aged 55 years or older).  
A prospective observational cohort study of 19,486 patients with IBD, including 
7,727 patients with UC or unclassified IBD, found an increased risk for 
developing lymphoproliferative disorders among patients receiving thiopurines 
compared to patients who had never received these drugs (hazard ratio: 5.28  
[95% CI: 2.01 - 13.9]).  
Past and concomitant thiopurine therapy appears to contribute to the risk in 
patients with IBD. Other risks may or may not be applicable to HSTCL which is 
rare.  
Risk factors for leukaemia depend on the type of leukaemia. In general, factors 
associated with an increased risk of leukaemia include smoking, exposure to 
certain chemicals such as benzene, exposure to radiation, past treatment with 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, having certain inherited or genetic disorders, 
having certain blood disorders, and having a family history of leukaemia.  
Factors associated with an increased risk of skin cancer include radiation (eg, 
sunlight, tanning, therapy), personal or family history of melanoma, fair skin, 
certain drugs (eg, antibiotics, hormones, antidepressants), medical conditions or 
drugs that suppress the immune system, damaged skin (old scars, burns, ulcers, 
or areas of inflammation), and exposure to arsenic.  
Additional risk factors that increase squamous cell cancer risk are human 
papilloma virus infection and actinic keratosis.  
Factors associated with an increased risk of melanoma include UV radiation (eg, 
sunlight, tanning), personal history of melanoma, family history of melanoma,

Important Identified Risk:  Malignancies  
fair skin, certain drugs (eg, antibiotics, hormones, antidepressants), medical 
conditions that suppress the immune system or are treated with drugs that 
suppress the immune system, dysplastic nevus, and having many common moles.  
Factors associated with an increased risk of MCC include advanced age, 
immunosuppression (eg, organ transplant, HIV), other cancers (eg, squamous 
cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen disease, internal malignancies and 
haematological neoplasias) and UV light exposure.

Data from Innovator clinical trials and post-marketing data. 
PML occurs predominantly among severely immunosuppressed patients. 
Currently, over 80% of PML cases are diagnosed in patients with HIV/AIDS. 
Prior to the era of HIV and AIDS, more than 60% of PML cases were seen in 
patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, with the highest incidence reported 
in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  Other immunosuppressive 
conditions that put patients at risk of developing PML include malignancies, 
organ transplants, SLE, and other rheumatic diseases.  
The potential mechanism for PML is reactivation of polyomavirus JC in the brain 
that is believed to be started by severe immunosuppression as in HIV infection. 
There is no known association of PML with the use of adalimumab or other TNF 
inhibitors, however, because PML is rare and often fatal its appearance in 
patients on biologic medications including adalimumab is under observation.

Important Potential Risk:  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data from Innovator clinical trials and post-marketing data. 
Suspected aetiologies in a published case series included hypertension (68%), 
eclampsia (11%), calcineurin inhibitor use (11%), and other (11%). Co-morbid 
conditions were common and included hypertension (53%), kidney disease 
(45%), dialysis dependency (21%), organ/marrow transplantation (24%), and 
various malignancies (32%).  
RPLS is a syndrome characterized by headache, confusion, seizures, and visual 
loss. This syndrome appears in patients who become severely immunosuppressed 
by drugs like those used for anti-rejection. Stopping the drug(s) makes the 
condition reverse. There is no known association of this event with adalimumab 
use; however, rare RPLS reports in patients using adalimumab have been 
received and although most have other causes, the reports are under observation 
for a possible association.

Important Potential Risk:  Adenocarcinoma of Colon in Ulcerative Colitis 
patients  
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data from Innovator clinical trials.   
Factors associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer include age greater 
than 50 years, presence of colorectal polyps, genetic predisposition, personal or 
family history of some cancers, duration of UC, extent and severity of UC, co-
morbid PSC, diet, and cigarette smoking.  
There is a known increased risk of adenocarcinoma of colon in UC patients that 
increases with degree of bowel inflammation as well as the duration of disease. 
Since early detection can limit morbidity from adenocarcinoma of colon, patients 
with UC, regardless of the therapy used, should receive routine screening 
(colonoscopy) more frequently than that recommended for the general population 
according to current practice guidelines. Since there may be an increased risk of 
cancer in patients receiving adalimumab, it is not known if this therapy further 
increases the risk of adenocarcinoma of colon in UC patients, thus, reports of this 
cancer are under observation in this patient group.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lorlatinib, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on proteinuria from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports, 
including in majority of cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge in 2 cases and re-
challenge in 3 cases, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between lorlatinib and proteinuria is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded 
that the product information of products containing lorlatinib should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation.

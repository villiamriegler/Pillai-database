SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Focetria  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full 
application  under  Art  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended,  has  been  given  allowing  access  to 
Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-
marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved at the time of the submission of the informed 
consent application. The application for Foclivia consists only of Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Foclivia medicinal product are identical to the 
quality, safety and efficacy profile of Focetria at the time of the submission of the informed consent 
application. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Focetria CHMP assessment 
report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Foclivia is a pandemic influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted with MF59 C1. It is 
an egg-derived, monovalent vaccine, manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant 
used  for  a  nationally  authorised  seasonal  Influenza  vaccine  “Fluad”,  a  trivalent  influenza  vaccine 
licensed in 12 countries through a Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP). 
Foclivia  is  indicated  for  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation. 
Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance. 
Future pandemics might not be caused by a H5N1 virus but will be due to another subtype of influenza 
virus (e.g.  with  haemagglutinin  of type  H1,  H2,  H7 or  H9).  In  line  with the  core  dossier  concept, a 
variation  would  therefore  have  to  be  submitted  to  introduce  the  WHO/EU  recommended  strain, 
prepared  from  the  influenza  virus  causing  the  pandemic,  prior  to  use  of  Foclivia  in  a  pandemic. 
Foclivia is not indicated for prophylactic use during the prepandemic period. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Focetria application, the quality data in support of 
the  Foclivia  application  are  identical  to  the  quality  data  of  the  Focetria  dossier  which  have  been 
assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures finalised at the time of the submission 
of the informed consent application). 
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Focetria  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in 
support of the Foclivia application are identical to the non-clinical data of the Focetria dossier which 
have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures finalised at the time of the 
submission of the informed consent application). 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Focetria application, the clinical data in support of 
the  Foclivia  application  are  identical  to  the  clinical  data  of  the  Focetria  dossier  which  have  been 
assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures finalised at the time of the submission 
of the informed consent application).

2.5 
Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant, which is 
identical to that of the authorised product Focetria, fulfilled the legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
The risk management plan, which is identical to that of the authorised product Focetria, was drafted in 
accordance with the CHMP core RMP for vaccines intended for use in a pandemic declared situation.  
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Focetria application, the CHMP considered that 
the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Foclivia  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for the following indication:  
“Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.  
Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance (see sections 4.2 and 
5.1).”

1. 
Introduction 
Isentress (raltegravir) was approved in the EU in December 2007 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection 
in  treatment-experienced  adult  patients  with  evidence  of  HIV-1  replication  despite  ongoing  anti-
retroviral therapy.  
In the initial application dossier safety and efficacy data to at least Week 24 were reported from the 
two  major  clinical  studies  (018  and  019)  that  supported  the  indication  granted  under  a  Conditional 
Approval.  Specific  Obligation  001  (SOB001)  concerned  the  provision  of  Week  48  data  from  these 
studies, which were filed as variation EMEA/H/C/860/II/01 (approved on 7 January 2009). 
Among the Follow-Up Measures (FUM) the MAH committed to provide completed reports on a list 
on ongoing and planned studies including study 021 as follows:

(Week 96) 
The MAH submitted the data required to fulfil this FUM directly as a variation (II/010) to the existing 
MA.  
The MAH initially provided: 
•  The Week 48 (primary analysis) safety and efficacy data from the Phase III study 021 
•  A  Clinical  Overview  and  Summaries  of  the  additional  clinical  pharmacology,  efficacy  and 
safety data obtained from previously ART-naïve subjects 
•  Proposed revisions of the SPC and PL 
•  A revised RMP (version 4.0). 
The SPC changes that are directly related to use in ART-naïve subjects affect sections: 
•  4.1 - to broaden the indication 
•  4.4 - to specify populations and remove the paragraph on cancers 
•  4.8 - to update the safety information with data from 021 
•  5.1 - to add information on efficacy in ART-naive to Week 48.  
PL changes were made accordingly to sections 1, 2 and 4. 
The MAH’s initial proposals for amendment of the SPC and PL are to be found in Attachment 2 to 
this Assessment Report. 
CHMP guidelines 
The CHMP guideline “Clinical Development of Medicinal Products for Treatment of HIV Infection” 
CPMP/EWP/633/02  (Rev.  2)  is  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  this  application.  A  convincing 
demonstration of non-inferiority at 48 weeks versus a well-recognised reference regimen may serve as 
a basis for approval, with data on prolonged follow up to be provided post approval. However, longer 
term  data  (i.e.  >  48  weeks)  might  be  required  pre-approval  if  there  are  any  specific  safety  concerns 
identified in clinical or non-clinical studies.  
Additional relevant data 
During the assessment period the MAH notified the CHMP in November 2008 of emerging data from 
studies  032  and  033,  in  which  patients  with  stable  viral  suppression  on  a  lopinavir/ritonavir-based 
regimen were switched to raltegravir without any change in backbone therapies. These studies failed

to  demonstrate  non-inferiority 
lopinavir/ritonavir regimen and the studies have been terminated.  
for  switching 
to 
raltegravir  compared 
to  maintaining  a 
Provisional data reported from these studies were reviewed by the CHMP. The CHMP considered that 
the  findings  could  potentially  impact  on  the  suitability  of  raltegravir  when  used  in  certain  specific 
combination  regimens  for  treatment  of  previously  ART-naïve  subjects.  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  an  opinion  on  variation  II/010  could  not  be  reached  until  the  reasons  for  the 
unexpected results had been explored.  
To this end, a list of questions on studies 032 and 033 was appended to the questions specific to study 
021  and  it  was  agreed  between  CHMP  and  the  MAH  that  the  responses  should  be  submitted 
concurrently. 
Therefore this assessment report takes into account relevant data from studies 032 and 033 although 
these studies were not conducted in ART-naïve subjects. 
Request  for  an  additional  year  of  marketing  protection  in  accordance  with  Article  14(11)  of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  
With submission of this application for a new indication for use in ART-naïve patients, the MAH also 
applied  for  an  additional  one  year  marketing  protection  period  in  accordance  with  Article  14(11)  of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  MAH  claimed  that  raltegravir  provides  a  significant  clinical 
benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  standard  of  care  in  the  HIV-1-infected  treatment-naïve  patient 
population.  
While the data from  study 021 result in a favourable risk benefit  balance for use of raltegravir with 
two other NRTIs in previously ART-naïve patients the data do not suggest that raltegravir has superior 
efficacy or safety compared to the single comparative regimen studied. Therefore, the MAH’s request 
for an additional year of marketing protection based on the new indication for use in previously ART-
naïve patients is not considered to be supported (see also the Attachment to this Assessment Report). 
2.  Clinical aspects 
2.1 
Clinical Pharmacology  
No pharmacokinetic data were obtained during the Phase III study 021 in ART-naïve subjects. 
The  application  contains  an  updated  analysis  of  pharmacokinetic  and  virological  outcome  data  from 
the Phase II study 004 in ART-naïve subjects that was previously reported. 
•  Part  I  of  this  study  consisted  of  10  days  of  raltegravir  monotherapy  (100,  200,  400  or  600  mg 
administered  twice  daily  as  the  Phase  II/III/FMI  poloxamer  formulation)  versus  placebo  in  35 
subjects (Cohort I).  
•  Part  II  evaluated  twice  daily  dosing  with  raltegravir  100,  200,  400  or  600  mg  versus  efavirenz 
600 mg  every  evening,  each  administered  in  combination  with  tenofovir  and  lamivudine  for  48 
weeks in a total of 198 subjects (Cohort I plus Cohort II). 
Intensive  PK  sampling  was  conducted  on  Day  10  of  monotherapy  in  Part  I  and  at  2  weeks  of 
therapy in Part II in Cohort I only.  
• 
•  Sparse PK sampling was performed at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. One sample was collected for all 
subjects  (both  Part  I  and  II  cohorts).  At  Weeks  4,  8  and  16  a  single  sample  was  collected 
irrespective  of  time  relative  to  dosing.  At  Week  12  a  single  sample  was  drawn  just  prior  to  the 
morning dose. 
In  the  previously  reported  analyses  there  were  marked  differences  in  the  absorption  profile  between 
sampling occasions within individual subjects and across the study population. There were no strong 
associations  with  explanatory  covariates  available  in  the  data  set.  This  behaviour  rendered  model-
Page 3 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based  predictions  of  exposure  from  the  sparse  sample  dataset  difficult  to  interpret.  Therefore,  three 
non-model-based exposure summary measures based on the observed concentration data were defined 
as follows (as applied already to data in treatment experienced subjects): 
•  Geometric  Mean  observed  C12h  (GM  C12h):  geometric  mean  of  all  samples  for  a  particular 
patient collected between 11 and 13 h post-dose.  
•  Geometric Mean of All Observed Concentration (GM All): geometric mean of all samples for a 
particular patient, regardless of when they were collected. GM All likely provides a more reliable 
estimate of a subject’s overall exposure to raltegravir than GM C12h. 
•  Minimum of All Observed Concentrations (Cmin): minimum value of all samples for a particular 
patient, regardless of time of collection.  
The available sparse sampling dataset for study 004 consisted of data from 151 out of 160 treated with 
raltegravir, with all 151 having values for GM All and Cmin. A subset of 104 had samples collected 
between 11 and 13 h post-dose and thus had GM C12h values. 
The  data  demonstrated  a  general  trend  of  increasing  concentrations  with  increasing  dose  but  with 
considerable overlap of values among the doses evaluated and almost complete overlap between the 
200 and 400 mg doses. The MAH considered that this finding was consistent with the large degree of 
inter-subject and inter-occasion variability observed with raltegravir in other studies. 
PK/PD analyses were conducted using the 2-step approach i.e. individual PK parameter values were 
first determined and then a statistical analysis of the potential relationship between PK and a variety of 
efficacy response parameters was performed.  
The concentration and efficacy dataset used for the analyses described below was the same as in the 
initial  application  and  only  the  PK  parameters  calculated  from  the  sparse  sampling  concentration 
dataset  have  changed.  GM  C12h  was  included  in  the  prior  analysis  and  the  results  have  been  re-
presented for completeness.  
Formal association analyses were performed for HIV RNA <400 copies/ml, HIV RNA <50 copies/ml, 
occurrence of virological failure and change from baseline in log10 HIV RNA at week 48. All subjects 
receiving any dose of raltegravir in a combination regimen were included in the analysis.  
The potential association between PK summary measure values and efficacy response measures was 
assessed through logistic regression model, in which an odds ratio (95% CI) was determined. The odds 
ratio coefficient resulting from the regression model could be interpreted as the percent change in the 
odds (probability of the event occurring over probability of the event not occurring) of the response for 
each  1-unit  increase  on  the  log10  scale  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameter.  Baseline  HIV  RNA  was 
identified  as  a  significant  predictor  of  treatment  outcome  and  so  was  included  along  with  the  PK 
parameters in the logistic regression models. 
In  the  PK/PD  association  analysis  only  a  subset  of  subjects  had  data  for  GM  C12h  and  there  were 
insufficient numbers in this group with HIV RNA ≥400 copies/ml or occurrence of virological failure 
to allow a formal association analysis. Formal statistical analyses for the occurrence of HIV RNA <50 
copies/ml and change from baseline in HIV RNA did not show any association with GM C12h.  
GM All and Cmin were available for most subjects. Associations with statistically significant p-values 
(p<0.05) were observed between the PK parameters GM All and Cmin and the treatment outcome HIV 
RNA <400 but in the opposite direction from what would be expected such that a higher value for GM 
All and Cmin decreased the probability of having HIV RNA <400. This relationship was demonstrated 
to  be  heavily  influenced  by  an  outlier  with  a  large  value  for  the  PK  parameters  but  with  some 
concentration  values  that  were  BLQ  and  the  anomaly  was  not  found  when  the  outlier  data  were 
excluded.  
No associations were observed between any PK parameter and HIV RNA <50, virological failure or 
change from baseline in HIV RNA. The MAH concluded that the results were consistent with a lack of 
Page 4 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a  meaningful  PK/PD  association  over  the  range  of  doses  tested  and  PK  values  observed  in  the 
treatment naïve population.  
Given  the  high  percentage  of  favourable  efficacy  responses  the  lack  of  a  meaningful  association 
between  PK  and  efficacy  response  measures  suggested  that  the  relationship  between  raltegravir 
concentrations  and  outcomes  fell  near  the  top  of  the  concentration-response  curve,  where  treatment 
response has, at most, only a weak concentration-dependency.  
Discussion on Pharmacology  
The PK data  demonstrated very considerable overlap in concentrations between dose groups and no 
clinically meaningful differences in efficacy response measures across GM C12h, GM All and Cmin. 
Baseline HIV RNA was negatively associated with the efficacy measures.  
The overall findings reflect the very marked inter-individual (and also intra-individual) variability in 
raltegravir PK that has been observed previously. The PK/PD analysis is hampered by paucity of PK 
sampling data and the very high favourable response rates. 
Overall  the  results  can  be  considered  consistent  with  the  previously  reported  analyses  in  treatment 
experienced subjects in the two Phase III studies (018 and 019). 
2.2 
Clinical Efficacy  
Study P021 
•  The study was initiated on 14 September 2006 and the last subject completed to Week 48 on 
5 June 2008.   
•  The  Week  48  data  cut-off  of  1  July  2008  for  the  current  clinical  study  report  captures  all 
clinical data to 5 June 2008, all viral resistance data to 10 June 2008 and genotyping results up 
to  27  August  2008.  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  reported  to  the  MAH’s  Worldwide 
Adverse Experience System (WAES) are included up to 31 May 2008. 
•  The  study  is  ongoing  to  Week  96.  The  MAH  expects  to  provide  the  data  for  Week  96  by 
31 December 2009. 
P021 is an ongoing randomised study that compares raltegravir with efavirenz in a double-blind design 
when  each  is  administered  to  previously  ART-naïve  adults  in  combination  with  open-label 
tenofovir/emtricitabine (200 mg emtricitabine + 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).  
There  were  initially  69  study  sites  spread  across  North  America,  Latin  America,  Europe,  India, 
Thailand and Australia of which 67 sites enrolled subjects. 
Patient selection 
Eligible  HIV-infected  adults  were  to  have  a  screening  (within  60  days  of  commencing  study 
treatment) plasma HIV RNA >5000 copies/ml as determined by the central laboratory. Subjects were 
to  be  ART-naïve  and  local  treatment  guidelines  were  to  be  considered  in  the  decision  to  initiate 
therapy. 
Within  35  days  of  commencing  treatment,  laboratory  studies  were  to  establish  that  serum  creatinine 
was ≤2.0 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) and that the liver function tests ALP, AST and ALT were 
all ≤5.0 x ULN. The calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault equation) was to be >30 ml/min. 
The  most  pertinent  exclusion  criteria  included  documented  resistance  to  tenofovir,  emtricitabine 
and/or  efavirenz  and  acute  hepatitis  due  to  any  cause.  Subjects  with  chronic  hepatitis,  including 
chronic HBV and/or HCV, were allowed to enter the study if they had stable liver function tests but 
Page 5 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
those with evidence of impaired hepatic synthetic function (e.g. hypoalbuminaemia or prolonged PT 
and PTT) were excluded.

Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  hypothesis  was  that  the  proportion  achieving  HIV  RNA  <50  copies/ml  at 
Week 48 in the raltegravir group was non-inferior to that in the efavirenz group.  
The Week 48 secondary efficacy hypotheses were:  
•  Proportion with <400 copies/ml at Week 48 in the raltegravir group was non-inferior to that in 
the efavirenz group 
•  Change from baseline in CD4 cell count was similar between raltegravir and efavirenz groups. 
The primary analyses of efficacy was based upon the full analysis set (previously known as modified 
intent  to  treat:  MITT)  approach.  Subjects  were  included  in  their  randomised  treatment  group 
regardless  of  adherence  to  the  entry  criteria,  actual  treatment  received  and  any  deviation  from  the 
protocol.  
The following approaches were used to handle missing values for those who prematurely discontinued 
assigned treatment: 
•  Observed Failure (OF): Subjects who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment due to lack 
of efficacy were considered as failures thereafter. 
•  Treatment-Related  Discontinuation  =  Failure 
(TRD=F):  Subjects  who  prematurely 
discontinued  assigned  treatment  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  or  AE  were  considered  as  failures 
thereafter. 
•  NC=F: Subjects who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment regardless of reasons were 
considered as failures thereafter. 
The  OF  and  TRD=F  approaches  excluded  missing  observations  from  analyses  while  the  NC=F 
approach considered these intermittent missing values as failures unless immediately flanked by two 
successes, in which case the intermittent missing value was excluded from the analyses. 
The  primary  analysis  at  Week  48  used  a  NC=F  approach  in  which  missing  values  after  premature 
discontinuation were filled in as failures. Week 48 time point proportions were computed within strata 
Page 6 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(> or ≤ 50,000 copies/ml) and then combined using weights proportional to the size of each stratum. 
The  95%  CIs  and  p-values  for  non-inferiority  for  treatment  differences  in  response  rates  were 
calculated  using  Miettinen  and  Nurminen’s  method  with  weights  proportional  to  the  size  of  each 
stratum. The primary and secondary efficacy analyses did not adjust for covariates. 
Time-to-Virological-Response  (TVR)  and  Time-to-Loss-Of-Virological-Response  (TLOVR)  were 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates and graphically displayed. A log rank test was 
applied to time-to-event data.  
The  primary  analysis  of  safety  was  based  upon  the  All  Patients  as  Treated  (APaT)  approach.  Only 
those AEs that occurred while on study therapy or within 14 days after discontinuation were included 
in the analysis. 
The  assessment  of  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  AEs  was  based  on  selected  MedDRA  terms 
(dizziness,  insomnia,  somnolence,  concentration  impaired,  depression,  nightmare,  confusional  state, 
suicidal  ideation,  nervous  system  disorder,  psychotic  disorder,  abnormal  dreams,  suicide  attempt, 
acute  psychosis,  delirium,  depressed  level  of  consciousness,  hallucination,  auditory  hallucination, 
completed suicide and major depression) at Weeks 0 to 8 and at Weeks 0 to 48.  
The  differences  in  percentages  with  CNS  AEs  between  treatments  and  two-sided  95%  CIs  using 
Miettinen and Nurminen’s method were calculated and the statistical comparisons of the differences 
were  based  on  a  two-tailed  Fisher’s  exact  test.  Time  to  first  CNS  AE  was  estimated  using  Kaplan-
Meier product-limit methods and graphically displayed. A log rank test was applied to time-to-event 
data. 
Results 
Three  of  the  566  subjects  who  were  randomised  did  not  receive  any  study  drug  and  were  excluded 
from all analyses.  
The following subjects had protocol violations but were included in the efficacy and safety analyses:  
•  Five had medication dispensing errors that led to them taking the wrong assigned drug for up 
to 2 months (mostly one month or less). 
•  Thirteen  did  not  meet  the  inclusion  criteria  for  obtaining  specific  laboratory  values  within 
35 days prior to the treatment phase. These 13 were considered to be clinically stable by the 
investigator at the time of randomisation.  
•  Four were not completely ART-naïve. One had received several agents over >3 years, two had 
received zidovudine during pregnancy and one had received just a single dose of zidovudine 
previously. These four did not disclose the prior treatment until after randomisation.  
•  Six took prohibited medications during the study, mostly of short duration. 
•  Eight  had  recent  signs  and  symptoms  of  active  infection  and/or  a  change  in  clinical  status 
noted at least 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment in the study. 
•  Three  (one  raltegravir  and  two  efavirenz)  were  prematurely  unblinded  to  the  investigator 
through  the  IVRS  and  without  consulting  the  Merck  Clinical  Monitor.  MRL  data  reviewers 
were not unblinded to this information. Data from these three were included in efficacy and 
safety analyses. 
Baseline patient characteristics for the full analysis set showed that most (about 80%) were males with 
a median age of 37 years. About 15% had a prior history of AIDS and about 7% per group were co-
infected  with  HBV  or  HCV.    It  is  notable  that  about  50%  of  subjects  had  >100,000  copies/ml  at 
baseline and just under 50% had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3. Despite the geographical spread about 
80% had clade B virus.  The most common (>15% in all subjects) secondary conditions reported were 
decreased CD4 lymphocytes (25.6%), lymphadenopathy (20.2%) and depression (18.1%).

As shown below, the analyses indicated that raltegravir was non-inferior to efavirenz with respect to 
the primary efficacy endpoint (< 50 copies/ml) and the secondary endpoint (<400 copies/ml). In fact, 
the lower bounds of the 95% CI around the differences in percentages of subjects that achieved these 
levels  of  viral  suppression  were  both  within  -2%.  The  raltegravir  group  also  showed  a  numerically 
greater mean change from baseline in CD4 cell count compared with efavirenz.

 ‡ The 95% CIs and p-values for non-inferiority for treatment differences in percent response were calculated using 
Miettinen and Nurminen's method with weights proportional to the size of each stratum (screen HIV RNA>50,000 
copies/ml or ≤ 50,000 copies/ml). The 95% CI for mean difference in CD4 change was based on t-distribution. 
 § Raltegravir is concluded non-inferior to Efavirenz if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in percent response 
is above -12 percentage points. It can be further concluded that Raltegravir is superior to Efavirenz if the lower bound 
exceeds zero. 
 N = Number of patients in each treatment group. 
The  sensitivity  analyses  using  alternative  methods  to  account  for  missing  data  gave  consistent 
findings, with lower 95% CI within -3%.  
Starting  from  Week  2  onwards  raltegravir  was  associated  with  a  more  rapid  decline  in  viral  load 
compared  to  efavirenz.  The  95%  CI  of  treatment  difference  for  percentages  with  <50  copies/ml 
excluded  zero  from  Week  2  to  Week  16  and  then  spanned  zero  up  to  Week  48.  Similar  findings 
applied to the analysis of percentages achieving <400 copies/ml over time, with 95% CI that excluded 
zero from Weeks 2-12 and then spanning zero up to Week 48. 
For  subjects  who  achieved  HIV  RNA  <50  copies/ml  time  to  virological  response  was  calculated  as 
time  between  randomisation  and  the  first  of  two  consecutive  values  (at  least  1  week  apart) 
<50 copies/ml. For subjects who did not achieve <50 copies/ml the time to virological response was 
censored at the time of analysis. The time to achieve virological response was significantly shorter in 
the raltegravir group, as shown in the figure below.

• 
As  shown below the risk  of loss of virological response was similar in the raltegravir and  efavirenz 
groups. Generally sustained responses were observed beyond Week 48 in both treatment groups.

CD4 counts 
At Week 48 the raltegravir group showed a greater increase in CD4 count (based on nominal 95% CI 
of treatment difference excluding zero) compared with efavirenz.

Outcomes by prognostic and stratification factors 
The  results  according  to  baseline  viral  load,  CD4  count  and  hepatitis  (OF  approach)  indicated  that 
raltegravir  achieved  similar  efficacy  to  efavirenz  regardless  of  these  baseline  prognostic  factors. 
Similar conclusions were drawn from the analysis based on the NC=F approach.  
Analysis by subpopulations 
The  raltegravir  treatment  group  showed  similar  efficacy  compared  with  efavirenz  regardless  of 
baseline  demographic  factors.  The  comparisons  of  CD4  counts  by  demographic  factors  also  gave 
similar findings between the treatment groups.  
Resistance 
The  MAH  previously  provided  phenotypic  evidence  that  four  integrase  mutations  (Q148H,  Q148R, 
Q148K, and N155H) were bona fide primary raltegravir resistance mutations. In addition, mutations at 
position  Y143  had  been  observed  and  were  listed  as  likely  primary  resistance  mutations  but  no 
phenotypic data had yet been generated. 
Phenotypic evidence was previously provided and showed that 8 additional mutations (L74M, E92Q, 
T97A, E138A, E138K, G140A, G140S and V151I) could augment resistance conferred by the primary 
mutations and these were therefore classified as secondary raltegravir resistance mutations. 
In study 021, genotyping of resistance mutations could only be performed in subjects with HIV RNA 
>400 copies/ml (i.e. not in all failures as defined at the <50 copies/ml level). Both the integrase gene 
and the reverse transcriptase gene (RT) were to be sequenced regardless of randomised therapy group. 
Of the 66 subjects who met the protocol definition of virological failure (27/281 [9.6%] raltegravir and 
39/282  [13.8%]  efavirenz)  genotyping  data  are  available  for  20,  including  12  and  8  in  respective 
groups.  
Page 11 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  four  subjects  in  the  raltegravir  group  with  reduced  susceptibility  to  the  agent  had  the following 
mutations in integrase at the time of failure that were not present at baseline (those in bold type are 
already recognised to be associated with reduced susceptibility to raltegravir): 
•  G140S, Q148H 
•  L74L/M, E92Q, T97T/A, Y143Y/H, Q95Q/R 
•  G140S, Q148R, V31V/I, V165V/I 
•  Y143R, L242L/F, R224R/W 
No amino acid changes from baseline in integrase known to be associated with raltegravir resistance 
were  found  in  viruses  obtained  from  other  subjects  who  failed  in  either  treatment  group.  Viruses 
isolated  from  some  subjects  had  amino  acid  changes  from  baseline  in  integrase  that  were  thought 
unlikely to confer resistance to raltegravir because they represent common polymorphisms, occurred 
in regions of the protein not previously known to contribute to resistance and/or were detected only 
sporadically (e.g. in only one of multiple RT-PCR reactions). Nevertheless it cannot be ruled out that 
certain of these changes could contribute to resistance to raltegravir. 
To  identify  new  raltegravir  resistance  mutations  using  a  phenotypic  approach,  amino  acid  changes 
from  baseline  that  had  been  observed  more  frequently  were  introduced  into  a  wild-type  HIV-1  pro-
viral clone by site-directed mutagenesis. Viral stocks produced from these vectors by transfection were 
tested in a single-cycle infection assay for sensitivity to raltegravir and for their replication capacity. 
A total of 32 variant viruses containing one or two specific mutations have been tested including 29 
that had not been tested at the time of the original MAA. These variants included 14 single mutations 
(L74I, L74M, L74I, T97A, Y143C, Y143H, Y143R, G163R, H183P, Y226C, Y226D, Y226F, Y226H 
and  S230N)  plus  15  double  mutations  (Y143C,  H  or  R  in  combination  with  L74M,  E92Q,  T97A, 
G163R or S230R).  
Y143R conferred >10-fold resistance while Y143C and Y143H conferred only ~2-fold resistance. The 
degree  of  resistance  was  enhanced  by  adding  secondary  mutations,  with  the  addition  of  E92Q 
conferring the highest-level resistance (32-fold, 15-fold and 215-fold when added to Y143C, Y143H 
and Y143R, respectively). 
Among the other single mutations tested, only two conferred measurable raltegravir resistance (E92Q, 
~3-fold  resistance;  S230R,  ~2-fold  resistance).  Eight  other  mutations  conferred  no  resistance  (L74I, 
L74M,  T97A,  G163R,  V151I,  Y226F  and  S230N).  The  results  for  L74M,  E92Q,  T97A  and  V151I 
were consistent with data reported previously. 
Five  mutations  resulted  in  viruses  with  significant  defects  in  replication  capacity  (L74R,  H183P, 
Y226C,  Y226D,  Y226H;  all  with  RC  <  0.5%  of  wild-type  virus)  so  no  phenotypic  data  could  be 
generated for these mutants. Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that only the intended mutations 
were introduced into the integrase genes of the proviral clones. Each of these mutant proviruses was 
independently  constructed  a  second  time  and  testing  of  the  resulting  viruses  confirmed  that  these 
changes  gave  rise  to  defective  infection  in  cell  culture.  The  data  indicate  that  these  mutations  cause 
severe replication defects, at least in the context of the provirus tested in the experiments. 
The MAH has confirmed that mutations Y143C, Y143H, Y143R, G163R and S230R constitute bona 
fide  raltegravir  resistance  mutations  and  mutations  at  Y143  confer  primary  resistance.  This 
information was therefore added to section 5.1 of the SPC.

•  Discussion on Efficacy  
The MAH conducted a generally satisfactory single study (although provision of a second study would 
have provided a more robust demonstration of efficacy) to assess the safety and efficacy of raltegravir 
in  previously  ART-naïve  subjects.  The  submission  of  data  to  Week  48  and  the  size  of  the  database 
were considered to be acceptable in light of the results provided thus far and also taking into account 
the data already available in an ART-experienced population. The results available so far support the 
MAH’s claim for non-inferiority of the raltegravir based regimen when compared to the efavirenz one 
in the target patient population of ART-naïve adult patients. However, the Week 96 data from study 
021 should be provided as soon as available (this is already reflected in previous commitments).  
The  comparative  regimen  of  efavirenz  plus  tenofovir  and  emtricitabine  (as  Truvada)  is  very  widely 
used in previously ART-naïve subjects and was a suitable choice for this study. While tenofovir may 
increase  plasma  exposure  to  raltegravir  it  seems  rather  unlikely  that  this  would  have  markedly 
augmented the efficacy of the raltegravir-containing regimen in study 021. This conclusion is based on 
the MAH’s population PK/PD analyses, which (although subject to several caveats due to paucity of 
samples  and  inherent  inter-subject  variation)  have  not  demonstrated  any  clear  and  consistent 
relationships between raltegravir PK parameters and virological responses in ART-naïve subjects.  
Questions  were  raised  regarding  extrapolation  of  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  for  raltegravir  when 
co-administered with tenofovir and emtricitabine (as Truvada, taken with food) to ART-naïve subjects 
to other potentially useful raltegravir-containing regimens in this population. However, this should not 
be an issue for ART-naïve subjects unless they have acquired a resistant HIV de novo. Therefore there 
are  no  grounds  at  present  to  restrict  the  use  of  raltegravir  in  previously  ART-naïve  subjects  to  co-
administration with tenofovir/emtricitabine. However, the CHMP requested that the SPC be modified 
to stress the limitations of the data provided by study 021, with which the MAH complied. 
Overall, the efficacy data of this trial in ART naïve patients support the extension of indication in this 
target population.  
Data  from  study  021  on  resistance  also  provided  some  useful  updated  information  on  raltegravir 
RAMs, which was added to Section 5.1 of the SPC. 
2.3 
Clinical Safety   
The mean number of days (range) for subjects on raltegravir at any dose was 395.1 (40 to 596) days up 
to  the  cut-off  for  this  report.  The  mean  number  of  days  (range)  for  those  on  the  protocol  dose  of 
raltegravir  (800  mg/day)  was  390.2  (33  to  591)  days.  The  difference  was  due  to  a  small  number  of 
dosing errors. 
Analysis of AEs  
The most frequently reported (incidence >10%) clinical AEs in both treatment groups were headache 
(19.6%  raltegravir,  23.0%  efavirenz),  diarrhoea  (14.6%,  21.6%),  nausea  (13.5%,  12.1%), 
nasopharyngitis  (13.2%,  10.6%),  upper  respiratory  infection  (12.1%,  12.4%)  and  insomnia  (10.7%, 
10.3%).  
Some AEs with an incidence >10% were reported only in the efavirenz group. These were dizziness 
(36.2%), abnormal dreams (13.1%), fatigue (11.0%), influenza (11.0%) and rash (11.7%). There were 
no AEs that occurred at an incidence >10% only in the raltegravir group. 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) 
•  Drug-related clinical AEs were reported by 341/563 (61%) treated subjects including 124 (44%) in 
the raltegravir group and 217 (77%) in the efavirenz group. Drug-related AEs reported in >10% 
occurred only in the efavirenz group (dizziness [33.7%], headache [13.8%] and abnormal dreams 
[13.1%]). 
Page 13 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Clinical  AEs  considered  to  be  related  to  raltegravir  or  efavirenz  alone  or  in  combination  with 
tenofovir/emtricitabine  were  reported  in  337/563  (59%)  including  121  (43%)  in  the  raltegravir 
group and 216 (77%) in the efavirenz group.  
•  Drug-related  clinical  AEs  considered  to  be  related  to  tenofovir/emtricitabine  were  reported  in 
15/563 (2.7%) including 8 (2.8%) in the raltegravir group and 7 (2.5%) in the efavirenz group. No 
individual AE occurred with an incidence ≥ 2% in either treatment group. 
Clinical  AEs  of  moderate  or  severe  intensity  that  were  considered  related  to  raltegravir  or  efavirenz 
(alone or in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine) or tenofovir/emtricitabine alone were reported 
in 135/563 (24%) treated of subjects including 45 (16%) in the raltegravir group and 90 (32%) in the 
efavirenz  group.  The  most  commonly  reported  were  headache  (3.9%  raltegravir,  4.6%  efavirenz), 
insomnia (3.6%, 3.2%) and nausea (2.8%, 3.5%). 
AEs of special interest  
Nervous System (pre-planned analysis) 
During  Weeks  0  to  8  there  were  statistically  significantly  fewer  subjects  with  one  or  more  nervous 
system  AEs  in  the  raltegravir  group  (20.3%)  compared  to  the  efavirenz  (52.1%)  group.  Between 
Weeks 8 and 48 an additional 18 subjects in the efavirenz group and an additional 16 in the raltegravir 
group reported nervous system AEs. The types of AEs were similar to those observed during Weeks 0 
to  8.  As  in  the  first  8  weeks,  there  were  statistically  significantly  fewer  subjects  with  at  least  one 
nervous system AE in the raltegravir group (26.0%) compared to the efavirenz group (58.5%).   
Rash 
AEs of rash (including terms of rash, erythematous rash, genital rash, generalised rash, macular rash, 
maculo-papular rash, papular rash, pruritic rash, pustular rash and vesicular rash) were reported for 81 
subjects including 23/281 (8.2%) in the raltegravir group and 58/282 (20.6%) in the efavirenz group. 
None of these AEs were serious but three subjects discontinued efavirenz due to rash. 
There were 44 subjects (7.8%) considered to have a drug-related rash of which 5 (1.8%) were in the 
raltegravir  group  and  39  were  in  the  efavirenz  group.  All  rashes  were  considered  mild  in  intensity, 
were non-serious and none resulted in discontinuation from the study. 
Pruritus 
Pruritus (including generalised pruritus) was reported in 9 subjects (3.2%) in the raltegravir group and 
11 (3.9%) in the efavirenz group. All cases of pruritus were of  mild to moderate intensity and none 
was serious or resulted in discontinuation. Of six cases that were considered to be drug-related there 
were two raltegravir and four efavirenz group subjects.   
Herpes Zoster 
HZ (including ophthalmic cases) was reported in 10 raltegravir and 11 efavirenz group subjects. Two 
of three cases considered drug-related occurred in the raltegravir group. No subject was discontinued 
due to HZ and most cases were of mild to moderate intensity. 
Hypersensitivity 
There were two cases of hypersensitivity/ drug hypersensitivity reported in each treatment group. All 
cases were non-serious and of mild to moderate intensity. One case per group was considered drug-
related.  
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) 
Investigators were asked to assess the possible association of each AE with IRIS. There were 17 (6%) 
raltegravir  and  11  efavirenz  subjects  (4%)  reported  to  have  AEs  associated  with  IRIS.  The  range  of 
conditions  included  herpes  simplex,  herpes  zoster,  oral  herpes,  pyrexia,  skin  papilloma  and 
tuberculosis affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Drug-related clinical AEs associated with IRS occurred 
in 8 and 3 subjects in respective groups. 
Five raltegravir and two efavirenz subjects had SAEs reported as associated with IRIS as follows:  
Page 14 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
In the raltegravir group two had a SAE stated to be associated with IRIS that was considered 
to  be  drug-related  (gonococcal  arthritis  of  the  knee  and  mycobacterium  immune  restoration 
disease).  The  other  three  SAEs  (IRS  with  neurosyphilis  and  ophthalmic  involvement,  IRIS 
associated  with  signs  and  symptoms  of  pancytopenia  and  Kaposi's  sarcoma  associated  with 
IRIS) were not considered by the investigator to be drug-related. 
In  the  efavirenz  treatment  group  one  of  the  two  cases  was  considered  drug-related  (IRIS 
associated with  Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia)  while the other patient had IRIS possibly 
associated with cytomegalovirus colitis. 
The  only  patient  who  discontinued  due  to  an  AE  associated  with  IRIS  was  the  raltegravir-treated 
patient with Kaposi's sarcoma, who later died (see further details below). 
Two subjects had a laboratory AE associated with IRIS – one in the raltegravir group with absolute 
neutrophil  count  decreased  and  one  efavirenz  patient  with  ALT  increased.  Both  events  were 
considered to be drug-related but not serious and the subjects continued on study therapy. 
Laboratory AEs 
Some  laboratory  AEs  were  associated  with  non-protocol  required  laboratory  tests  or  reflex  tests. 
Because  only  a  small  number  of  tests  were  performed,  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  these 
laboratory AEs may appear inflated compared with tests done routinely. 
The  most  frequently  reported  (incidence  ≥2%)  reported  laboratory  AEs  were  AST  increased  (4.6% 
raltegravir and 5.3% efavirenz) and ALT increased (3.2%, 5.0%), which are discussed further below. 
Laboratory  AEs  that  were  reported  only  in  the  raltegravir  group  at  rates  of  ≥2%  were  blood  LDH 
increased  (in  1/2  tested),  hepatitis  C  antibody  positive  (in  1/2  tested),  absolute  neutrophil  count 
decreased (2.1%), atypical lymphocytes (in 1/50 tested) and prostatic specific antigen increased (in the 
single subject tested).  
However,  there  were  no  laboratory  AEs  associated  with  standard  (protocol-specified)  tests  with  an 
incidence of >10% in either treatment group. 
Laboratory ADRs 
Overall,  drug-related  laboratory  AEs  occurred  in  14  raltegravir  (5.0%)  and  24  efavirenz  subjects 
(8.5%)  with  increases  in  AST  most  frequently  reported  (2.1%,  2.8%).  Drug-related  laboratory  AEs 
considered 
in  combination  with 
tenofovir/emtricitabine)  were  reported  by  13  (4.6%)  and  24  subjects  (8.5%),  respectively,  the 
commonest being AST increased (2.1%, 2.8%). 
raltegravir  or  efavirenz 
(alone  or 
to  be

to 
Hepatitis co-infection 
18/281 (6.4%) patients in the raltegravir group were hepatitis B and/or C positive and 16/282 (5.7%) 
patients  in  the  efavirenz  group.  The  safety  profiles  of  raltegravir  and  efavirenz  in  patients  with 
hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were comparable with the profiles observed in patients 
without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection. Transaminase elevations were more common 
among co-infected patients, but were generally low-grade and not of clinical significance. 
SAEs and deaths 
The  two  SAEs  resulting  in  death  that  have  been  reported  thus  far  occurred  in  the  raltegravir  group.  
Neither of these fatal adverse experiences (Kaposi's sarcoma AIDS-related and cerebral haemorrhage) 
was determined by the investigator to be drug-related. Details of these cases are as follows:  
KS  case:  This  was  a  28  year-old  black  male  with  anxiety,  arthritis,  candidiasis,  depression, 
gynaecomastia, headache, penicillin allergy, pruritus and sulfonamide allergy (and a medical history 
of  ankle  fracture,  asthma,  bone  graft/internal  fixation  of  fracture,  pneumonia,  seasonal  allergy  and 
Page 15 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
staphylococcal  infection).  Concomitant  therapy  included  ibuprofen,  fluconazole,  dronabinol  and 
doxycycline. Baseline HIV RNA was 319,000 copies/ml and CD4 count was 23 cells/microlitre.  
On Day 57 (when HIV RNA was 103 copies/ml and CD4 count was 155 cells/microlitre) the patient 
was hospitalised and diagnosed with IRIS in association with Kaposi's sarcoma. Symptoms included 
severe  abdominal  pain,  weakness,  dehydration,  loss  of  appetite,  nausea,  diffuse  lymphadenopathy, 
rectal  mass,  bloody  stools,  chest  pain  associated  with  breathing,  anaemia,  a  caecal  lesion  and  fever. 
Treatment  included  dapsone,  promethazine,  hydromorphone,  acetylcysteine  and  acetaminophen.  The 
patient  was  later  discharged  with  IRIS  and  Kaposi's  sarcoma  still  continuing.  The  patient  was  re-
admitted due to uncontrolled abdominal pain and he was discontinued from the study on Day 72 due 
to  the  need  for  chemotherapy.  He  eventually  died  despite  treatment  on  Day  106.  The  investigator 
reported that IRIS was definitely not related to study drug and that Kaposi's sarcoma was probably not 
drug related. 
Cerebral  haemorrhage  case:   This  was   a  57  year  old  Asian  male  with  concurrent  conditions  that 
included AIDS, gouty arthritis and a medical history that included cerebrovascular accident, decreased 
CD4 lymphocytes, gout, hypertension and hyperuricaemia. Concomitant therapy included ibuprofen, 
hydrochlorothiazide,  allopurinol  and  atenolol.  On  Day  90 he  was  found  unconscious  and  brought  to 
the hospital. He had a head wound that was compatible with violence. A CT scan showed intracerebral 
haematoma  at  bilateral  occipital  lobes.  He  discontinued  study  therapy,  continued  to  deteriorate  and 
died on Day 96. The investigator considered that the haemorrhage was definitely not related to study 
therapy. 
Non-fatal SAEs 
There  were  79  SAEs  reported  from  55  subjects  up  to  the  cut-off  date,  including  28  (10%)  in  the 
raltegravir group and 27 (9.6%) in the efavirenz group. Nine of these 79 (4 raltegravir) had SAEs that 
were determined by the investigators to be drug-related. The four raltegravir group subjects included 
one  with  mental  disorder  considered  related  to  raltegravir,  two  cases  of  IRIS  considered  related  to 
raltegravir  in  combination  with  tenofovir/emtricitabine  and  one  accidental  overdose  related  to 
tenofovir/emtricitabine. 
There were two laboratory SAEs but these occurred in a single subject in the efavirenz group and were 
not considered drug-related. 
Neoplasms 
There  were  7  neoplasms  (benign,  malignant  and  unspecified)  in  the  raltegravir  group  (2.5%)  and 
15 such reports in the efavirenz group (5.3%). This number included one case of Kaposi’s sarcoma in 
the raltegravir group compared to 6 cases in the efavirenz group. There were also 4 and 6 cases of skin 
papilloma reported in respective groups.  Only one of the 8 subjects with SAEs of malignancy was in 
the raltegravir group – this was the subject with Kaposi’s sarcoma who died as described above.  
The  seven  malignancies  reported  as  SAEs  in  the  efavirenz  group  included  anal  cancer  (1),  bone 
neoplasm malignant (1) and Kaposi's sarcoma AIDS-related (5). There were another two subjects in 
the efavirenz group with malignancy not counted among these seven – one had worsening of Kaposi’s 
sarcoma that was considered non-serious and one had a SAE of B-cell lymphoma with onset >14 days 
after discontinuation of study therapy. Three of the cases in the efavirenz group were considered to be 
recurrences.  
The CD4 cell counts reported at the time of onset for each cancer ranged from 17 to 618 cells/mm3 
and 7/10 had HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml.

Discontinuations due to AEs  
Nine  raltegravir  (3.2%)  and  17  efavirenz  subjects  (6%)  discontinued  study  therapy  due  to  a  clinical 
AE.  
Laboratory data 
The following issues merit some particular mention: 
Plasma lipids 
Raltegravir therapy was associated with small increases in total and LDL cholesterol and a decrease in 
serum triglycerides as well as a modest increase in HDL cholesterol. The mean change from baseline 
was significantly lower in the raltegravir group compared to the efavirenz group for serum cholesterol, 
HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides and non-HDL-C (p<0.001). The mean percent change from baseline for 
serum  cholesterol,  HDL-C,  triglycerides  and  non-HDL-C  was  significantly  lower  in  the  raltegravir 
group. The differences between treatment groups were present from Week 12 onwards. Lipid-lowering 
therapy  was  commenced  in  three  raltegravir  and  11  efavirenz  subjects  up  to  Week  48  while  four  in 
each group increased their dose of such agents during the reporting period. 
ALT/AST elevations 
Rates  of  aminotransferase  elevations  were  generally  comparable  between  raltegravir  and  efavirenz. 
These were generally transient, not associated with clinical AEs and did not limit study therapy. Grade 
2  or  higher  elevations  in  ALT  occurred  in  7.5%  (21/281)  raltegravir  subjects  and  9.2%  (26/282) 
efavirenz subjects. The increases were reported as laboratory AEs in 9 and 14 subjects in respective 
groups (5 and 10 of which were considered drug-related with a range of 66 to 169 IU/l.  
Grade  2  or  higher  elevations  in  AST  occurred  in  5.7%  (16/281)  raltegravir  and  7.1%  (20/282) 
efavirenz  subjects.  Increased  AST  was  reported  as  a  laboratory  AE  in  4.6%  and  5.3%  in  respective 
groups of which 6 (2.1%) and 8 (2.8%) were considered drug-related with a range of 45 to 259 IU/l. 
Two  raltegravir  subjects  with  Grade  2  or  higher  AST  or  ALT  increases  experienced  hepatobiliary 
disorders (severe cholecystitis and mild hepatomegaly) that were not considered to be drug-related and 
did not cause a drug interruption or discontinuation. 
Bilirubin 
Grade 1 elevations in total serum bilirubin occurred in 15/281 in the raltegravir group (5.3%) versus 
none in the efavirenz group. Additionally, 3.2% (9/281) raltegravir subjects had a Grade 2 total serum 
bilirubin  value  compared  to  only  one  (0.4%)  in  the  efavirenz  group.  Grade  3  elevations  occurred  in 
two (0.7%) and none per group and there were no Grade 4 elevations in either treatment group. The 
elevations  were  primarily  indirect  (i.e.  unconjugated)  bilirubin,  most  were  intermittent  and  resolved 
without interruption of therapy and they generally did not arise in conjunction with other liver function 
test abnormalities. Only one elevation was reported as a laboratory AE.  
Two  of  the  24  raltegravir  subjects  with  Grade  1  or  2  bilirubin  abnormalities  were  co-infected  with 
hepatitis B and another was co-infected with hepatitis C. One had cholecystitis while on study. Six had 
elevated total bilirubin prior to receiving study drug. The majority of elevations were isolated and all 
except  three  subjects  had  levels  that  were  returning  toward  baseline  at  the  cut-off  date.  These  three 
exceptions comprised: 
•  Baseline Grade 1 elevation (1.8 mg/dl) but Grade 2 elevation (2.3 mg/dl) at the cut-off  
•  Normal baseline (0.6 mg/dl) but Grade 1 (1.4 mg/dl) elevation at the cut-off 
•  Normal baseline (0.9 mg/dl) but 1.3 mg/dl (Grade 1) at the cut-off.  
Two raltegravir subjects had a Grade 3 elevation in bilirubin. One went from a baseline 0.4 mg/dl to a 
Grade  3  (3.1  mg/dl)  on  Day  421,  considered  possibly  related  to  combination  therapy.  However,  the 
bilirubin returned to baseline without any interruption to study therapy. The other went from a baseline 
of  0.4  mg/dl  to  a  Grade  3  (3.1  mg/dl)  on  Day  169  of  study  therapy.  Again,  bilirubin  subsequently 
returned to baseline without any interruption to study therapy.

Hepatobiliary disorders were reported in 2.1% (6/281) raltegravir and 0.4% (1/282) efavirenz subjects. 
Only one of these raltegravir subjects had a Grade 2 elevation in total bilirubin along with a clinical 
diagnosis of cholecystitis. All subjects continued on study. 
In the Phase II study in the ART-naïve (study 004) Grade 1 bilirubin elevations were seen in 16 (10%) 
in the raltegravir group versus 1 (2.6%) in the efavirenz group while Grade 2 elevations occurred in 
six and no patients in respective groups. There were no Grade 3 or 4 elevations, only one raltegravir 
patient  had  a  laboratory  AE  of  elevated  bilirubin,  none  of  the  cases  was  serious  and  no  patient 
discontinued secondary to bilirubin elevation. In the Phase III studies there was a slightly higher rate 
of hyperbilirubinaemia in the raltegravir group even among those who did not receive atazanavir in the 
OBT. 
As  reported  previously  the  potential  for  raltegravir  to  inhibit  UGT1A1  was  evaluated  in  vitro  using 
human  liver  microsomes.  The  drug  was  added  at  various  concentrations  (0.07-50  μM)  to  a  reaction 
mixture containing human liver microsomes, UDPGA and the UGT1A1 marker substrate oestradiol at 
a concentration of 100 μM. The resulting IC50 value was >50 μM (well above the anticipated Cmax of 
approximately 4.5 μM for a 400 mg BID dose) indicating that raltegravir is not a potent inhibitor of 
UGT1A1 in this in vitro system. 
The findings of elevated unconjugated bilirubin show that, despite the in vitro findings, raltegravir has 
some  capacity  to  inhibit  UGT1A1  in  some  patients.  It  is  not  so  very  rare  that  in  vitro  data  do  not 
wholly predict the in vivo situation with regard to drug-drug-interactions. 
While it is possible to agree with the MAH that currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend 
avoidance of co-administration of raltegravir with known inhibitors of UGT1A1 it cannot be ruled out 
that some patients could experience clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Therefore, the current 
statement  on  the  interaction  of  raltegravir  with  UGT1A1  needed  a  thorough  revision;  deleting  the 
statement that raltegravir is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1.  
Serum Creatinine 
The frequency of elevations in Grade 1 serum creatinine was slightly higher in the raltegravir group 
(4.6% [13/281] compared to 1.4% [4/282]). The mean change from baseline was negligible for both 
groups (0.02, -0.01). Four raltegravir subjects had Grade 1 elevations in creatinine at baseline. During 
the time of the elevations, there were no significant related AEs and the majority of elevations were 
transient. Five continued with Grade 1 elevations at the time of the cut-off but none discontinued study 
related to this abnormality. 
DEXA data 
Total body fat, total appendicular fat and total truncal fat levels were measured by DEXA scan in a 
subset of patients at baseline and at Week 48. DEXA measurement showed minimal gains in body fat, 
with no patterns of fat loss over 48 weeks. AEs of lipodystrophy (including fat tissue increased and 
lipoatrophy) were reported only in two efavirenz subjects. 
Drug interactions 
The  solubility  of  raltegravir  increases  with  increasing  pH.  Administration  of  omeprazole  prior  to 
administration  of  raltegravir  in  healthy  subjects  resulted  in  an  approximately  3.1-fold  increase  in 
raltegravir AUC0-∞, 4.1-fold increase in Cmax and 46% increase in C12hr. The MAH considered that a 
likely  mechanism  to  explain  these  results  was  increased  bioavailability  of  raltegravir  due  to  higher 
gastric pH. 
However,  the  sparse  PK  dataset  from  previously  reported  Phase  II  and  III  studies  in  treatment 
experienced subjects did not show an effect of gastric pH-altering agents on raltegravir plasma levels. 
It  has  been  reported  that  AIDS  is  associated  with  gastropathy  and  hypochlorhydria.  The  MAH 
proposed that this might explain why the findings in Phase II and III studies contrasted with those in a 
drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects. 
Page 18 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study 021 the MAH examined the safety profile of raltegravir in those who did and did not receive 
concomitant agents that modify gastric pH (i.e. any PPI and/or H2 blockers at study entry and during 
the  study).  However,  the  analysis  is  severely  limited  by  the  fact  that  only  19/281  in  the  raltegravir 
group  took  one  or  more  concomitant  pH  altering  agents  during  the  treatment  period.  Clinical  AEs 
occurred  in  18/19  (94.7%)  compared  to  235/262  (89.7%)  not  using  a  pH  altering  agent.  Only  4/19 
reported a SAE (secondary syphilis, limb injury, neurosyphilis and anaemia) and these SAEs were not 
considered  drug-related  by  the  investigator.  Laboratory  AEs  occurred  in  3/19  (15.8%)  compared  to 
24/262 (9.2%). The frequencies of Grade 1 serum LDL-cholesterol abnormalities were 26.3% (5/19) 
versus  14.5%  (38/262).  Grade  1  abnormalities  of  total  serum  cholesterol  were  reported  for  31.6% 
(6/19) versus 17.6% (46/262).  
Pregnancies 
One raltegravir and two efavirenz subjects reported a pregnancy during the course of the study. The 
raltegravir subject reported her pregnancy on Day 77, having interrupted study therapy on Day 75, and 
subsequently  discontinued  from  the  study.  The  patient  continued  the  pregnancy  to  term  with  no 
complications and gave birth to a healthy baby girl via Caesarean section. 
Discussion on Safety 
Study  021  indicated  that  the  safety  profile  of  raltegravir  +  tenofovir/emtricitabine  was  generally 
comparable  to  that  of  efavirenz  +  tenofovir/emtricitabine.  Some  ADRs  known  to  be  associated  with 
efavirenz  use  (e.g.  the  CNS  AEs  singled  out  for  analysis  by  the  MAH  and  rashes)  were  reported  at 
lower rates in the raltegravir group.  
Low  grade  (1  and  2)  elevation  in  bilirubin  occurred  more  commonly  in  the  raltegravir  group.  Most 
cases  involved  elevations  of  indirect  (i.e.  unconjugated)  bilirubin,  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of 
therapy  and  resolved  while  subjects  remained  on  raltegravir.  The  increases  in  total  and  indirect 
bilirubin  in  the  raltegravir  group  point  to  the  conclusion  that  the  in  vitro  data  indicating  lack  of 
inhibition of UGT1A1 by raltegravir are not borne out in the clinic at therapeutic raltegravir doses and 
the SPC was modified accordingly.  
The data on rates of malignancies, taken in conjunction with the update provided in variation II/01, are 
reassuring.  Variation  II/10  was  filed  concurrently  with  provision  of  the  results  of  the  non-clinical 
carcinogenicity  studies  (II/09),  for  which  the  CHMP  adopted  a  positive  opinion  on  23  April  2009, 
concluding  that  the  studies  in  rodents  did  not  indicate  an  increased  risk  of  cancer  with  the  use  of 
raltegravir. Taking into account the conclusions from that report, it can be agreed that removal of the 
paragraph on malignancies from section 4.4 is now possible. The paragraph in Section 4.8, however, 
was retained with some amendment. 
The use of pH altering agents in the raltegravir group did seem to be associated with higher rates of 
some AEs. While the analysis is indeed severely limited the rates of clinical and laboratory AEs were 
higher in those taking concomitant pH-altering agents. In this regard, the MAH will conduct a study of 
the effects of omeprazole in HIV-infected subjects (see study 054; report on FUM 022). Meanwhile, 
the  current  SPC  advice  to  use  raltegravir  with  agents  that  increase  gastric  pH  only  if  unavoidable 
remains appropriate. 
3.  Pharmacovigilance – Risk Management Plan  
The version of the RMP (4.0) supplied initially with this variation to extend the indication to treatment 
naïve HIV-infected subjects required some revisions that were provided with the answers to the RSI. 
An  updated  RMP  version  4.1,  dated  6  February  2009  was  submitted,  with  changes  to  the  previous 
version  highlighted.  In  line  with  the  CHMP’s  request,  inconsistencies  regarding  version  numbers  in 
headers and footers had been resolved.  
Page 19 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A  single  table  summarising  the  most  relevant  clinical  trial  exclusion  criteria  from  all  studies,  rather 
than by individual study, was provided. All references to MK-0518 were changed to raltegravir, unless 
the former was part of a study title. 
Clarification  on  the  proposed  submission  date  for  the  protocol  for  the  collaborative  study  to 
characterise raltegravir resistance was provided, insofar as it was submitted on 17 October 2008 to the 
CHMP.  However,  no  study  number  was  provided.  In  version 4.1  of  the  RMP,  no  annexes  had  been 
provided  and  the  MAH  stated  “not  applicable”  and  “planned”  for  the  protocol  version  and  protocol 
status respectively. In response to these last two outstanding issues, the MAH provided a duly revised 
RMP version 5.0 complete with annexes in the framework of the last PSUR submission on 21 May 
2009, which will be assessed separately. This version of the RMP contains the protocol for the study 
to  characterise  raltegravir  resistance  which  is  now  ongoing.  It  is  also  noted  in  the  RMP  that  the 
planned date for final submission of the data is 30th September 2010.  
4.  Additional Data relevant to this application – Protocols 032&033 
In  addition  to  the  above  discussed  data,  additional  information  on  raltegravir  was  provided  by  the 
MAH to the CHMP on 18 December 2008. 
HIV Protocols 032 and 033: Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Active-controlled Studies To 
Evaluate the Safety and Antiretroviral Activity of MK-0518 Versus KALETRA (lopinavir/ritonavir) 
in HIV-Infected Patients Switched from Stable KALETRA-Based Regimens 
Introduction 
Two  studies  with  identical  designs  (Protocol  032  033)  were  initiated  to  evaluate  the  potential  of 
raltegravir to improve the tolerability of long term antiretroviral therapy in patients with stable viral 
suppression  on  a  lopinavir/ritonavir-based  regimen.  Patients  were  eligible  for  enrolment  if  they  had 
documented HIV RNA <50 copies/ml (or bDNA ≤75 copies/ml) for at least 3 months prior to study 
entry while on a lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen (dosed as 400 mg lopinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice 
daily). The regimen was to consist of lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with at least 2 NRTIs, without 
a change in ART or documentation of HIV RNA ≥50 copies/ml during the previous 3 months. 
The  studies  randomised  patients  to  maintain  their  regimen  or  to  switch  from  lopinavir/ritonavir  to 
raltegravir without changes in backbone therapy. The effects on serum lipid parameters and the overall 
safety/tolerability  profile  were  to  be  assessed  along  with  the  ability  of  raltegravir  to  maintain  HIV 
suppression. 
Protocol  033  was  the  first  of  the  studies  in  which  all  patients  completed  to  Week  24  (the  primary 
efficacy  endpoint).  A  summary  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  was  provided  to  CHMP, 
which  showed  that  switching  patients  on  a  stable  lopinavir/ritonavir-based  regimen  to  a  raltegravir-
based  regimen  was  associated  with  some  improvement  in  serum  lipid  levels  and  diarrhoea  but  the 
efficacy  results  raised  concerns  regarding  the  ability  of  raltegravir-based  regimens  to  maintain  HIV 
suppression when compared to lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens. 
The primary efficacy analysis used a Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach. The observed failure 
(OF) approach, which focuses on the antiretroviral effect of treatment, was performed as a sensitivity 
analysis for the primary efficacy analysis and was the primary approach used for subgroup analyses.  
Data provided in December 2008 from patients on raltegravir-based regimens  showed that  88% had 
<50  copies/ml  at  Week  24  compared  to  93.8%  of  the  patients  who  remained  on  their 
lopinavir/ritonavir-based  regimens.  In  particular,  raltegravir  did  not  demonstrate  non-inferiority  as 
compared  to  lopinavir/ritonavir  with  respect  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV  RNA  <50 
copies/ml  at  Week  24.  At  Week  24  the  difference  (raltegravir-lopinavir/ritonavir)  was  -5.8%  (-12.2; 
0.22).  
Page 20 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  MAH  then  evaluated  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  at  Week  24  for  patients  enrolled  in 
Protocol 032  using  preliminary  un-audited  data  and  obtained  a  similar  result.  At  week  24  the 
difference (raltegravir-lopinavir/ritonavir) in proportion of patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml was 
-7.1%  with  a  95%  confidence  interval  of  (-15.0;  0.67).  These  efficacy  results  were  unexpected.  The 
MAH informed all investigators and stopped enrolment. Patients were about to be unblinded so that 
investigators could make appropriate clinical decisions on further therapy.  
The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  could  be  important  information  arising  from  more  detailed 
investigation  of  the  reasons  why  raltegravir  failed  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  with  respect  to 
lopinavir/ritonavir  in  these  two  studies  that  could  potentially  impact  on  the  regimens  within  which 
raltegravir  could  be  used  in  the  management  of  previously  ART-naïve  patients.  Therefore  questions 
raised by studies 032 and 033 were included in the first RSI for this variation in December 2009, as 
the CHMP considered that the assessment of the study results could potentially impact the benefit risk 
assessment of raltegravir in the treatment of ART naïve patients. The following section therefore gives 
an assessment of the data provided in response to these questions, focusing on the impact on the target 
population of ART naïve patients.   
Treatment histories and analysis of consequential virological outcomes 
Since the original protocols did not collect the full treatment history, a supplemental case report form 
was  designed  to  collect  these  data  after  the  Week  24  data  analysis.  The  overall  extent  of  prior 
treatment  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups  for  each  study  although  the  duration  of  prior 
treatment  was  slightly  shorter  in  the  raltegravir  group  compared  to  the  lopinavir/ritonavir  group  in 
study 033. The most common agents used prior to study entry were NRTIs but there was considerable 
use  of  NNRTIs  and  PIs  other  than  lopinavir/ritonavir.  Prior  ARTs  used  were  generally  comparable 
between studies and across the treatment groups. 
Further  data  were  extracted  from  CRFs  following  the  Week  24  data  analysis  in  order  to  clarify 
whether patients were on their first treatment regimen prior to enrolment or on a regimen that had been 
successfully  instituted  after  failure  to  respond  to  one  or  more  prior  regimens.  This  supplemental 
treatment  history  was  collected  for  all  702  patients.  In  both  treatment  groups  approximately  60%  of 
patients  in  032  and  70%  in  033  indicated  that  the  lopinavir/ritonavir-containing  regimen  in  use  at 
screening  was  not  their  first  regimen.  Between  28%  and  37%  per  study  and  treatment  group  had  a 
history  of  prior  virological  failure  with  slightly  higher  rates  in  033.  Treatment  groups  were  well 
balanced within each study regarding these questions although patients in 033 clearly had greater prior 
exposure to ARTs compared with those in 032. 
The  tables  below  show  for  each  study  the  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV  RNA  <50  copies/ml  at 
Week  24  by  treatment  history  using  the  observed  failure  approach,  which  provides  results  that  are 
consistent with all other subgroup analyses performed for these studies. 
• 
• 
In  study  032  virological  response  rates  were  comparable  between  the  raltegravir  and 
lopinavir/ritonavir groups for those patients who were on their first ART regimen at entry and also 
for patients who had not experienced prior virological failure. 
In study 033 virological response rates were higher in the lopinavir/ritonavir group among those 
patients who were on their first ART regimen at entry but were more comparable between groups 
for patients who had not experienced prior virological failure. 
•  Both  studies  clearly  showed  that  among  those  patients  who  had  more  extensive  prior  treatment, 
with or without a documented prior failure, the rates of virological suppression were higher in the 
groups  that  continued  with  lopinavir/ritonavir  and,  in  complete  contrast  to  the  raltegravir  group, 
there  was  no  discernible  effect  of  extent  of  prior  treatment  or  failure  pre-study  on  the  response 
rates in the lopinavir/ritonavir groups. 
Page 21 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analyses  using  the  NC=F  approach  for  the  proportion  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV  RNA 
<50 copies/ml at Week 24 by treatment history for studies 032 and 033 individually showed that while 
the actual numbers are slightly different the pattern of findings was the same as described above using 
the observed failure approach. 
Therefore  it  seems  that  more  extensive  pre-treatment  with  ARTs,  with  or  without  a  prior  failure  of 
ART,  leads  to  a  lower  likelihood  of  maintaining  virological  suppression  after  switching  to  a 
raltegravir-based regimen. In complete  contrast, there is no discernible effect of these factors on the 
virological suppression rates in those who continued with lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Discussion 
In reflection of the inclusion criteria for these studies, the population enrolled was heterogeneous with 
respect  to  treatment  histories.  There  was  no  a  priori  stratification  of  patients  based  on  treatment 
history and it is pertinent to note that information on treatment histories was collected a posteriori and 
in response to the unexpected findings. 
Page 22 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Virological suppression rates among patients on their first ART regimen and those with no reported 
history of virological failure were generally comparable between the raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir 
groups except that study 033 suggested that even in those on their first regimen there was already a 
disadvantage for switching to raltegravir. In contrast, patients with more extensive exposure to ARTs, 
with or without a prior virological failure, were more likely to maintain virological suppression if they 
remained on their lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen.  
Prior  treatment  ±  failure  did  not  impact  on  the  lopinavir/ritonavir  response  rates  in  either  study. 
However  all  the  patients  who  entered  these  studies  had  already  been  on  a  lopinavir/ritonavir-based 
regimen  for  at  least  3  months  without  any  document  viral  load  ≥50  copies/ml.  Therefore,  these 
patients  were  already  selected  out  for  a  greater  likelihood  of  a  longer-term  response  to 
lopinavir/ritonavir  since  any  patients  who  were  not  responding  adequately  to  a  lopinavir/ritonavir-
based regimen within 3 months of enrolment were already eliminated. To some extent this fact implies 
a degree of bias in favour of continuation on lopinavir/ritonavir that would not have existed if subjects 
had been randomised to lopinavir/ritonavir or raltegravir de novo at enrolment. 
Despite  these  considerations  of  potential  bias,  it  remains  a  fact  that  switching  from  a  successful 
lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen to a raltegravir-based regimen was not an optimal treatment strategy 
for a substantial number of patients and this observation applied to patients on their first (in one study) 
or subsequent (both studies) regimens.   
Since data from other sources (see study 021 above) indicate that the rate of resistance to raltegravir is 
probably low in previously unexposed virus, the most likely explanation for failure after switching to 
raltegravir  is  that  patients  had  viruses  that  were  not  fully  susceptible  to  other  agents  in  the  total 
regimen and, as a result, have been at particular risk of selecting for raltegravir-resistant virus during 
treatment. Thus, the relative importance of co-administration with active backbone therapy is greater 
for raltegravir than for lopinavir/ritonavir.  
The advice already given in section 4.4 of the SPC on co-administration of raltegravir with at least one 
other  active  agent  in  all  populations  was  prompted  by  concerns  regarding  the  low  genetic  barrier  to 
resistance to raltegravir and it reads as follows: 
In  treatment-experienced  patients  higher  response  rates  were  observed  in  patients  with  Genotypic 
Sensitivity Score (GSS)>0.  Patients with GSS or Phenotypic Sensitivity Score (PSS)=0 had a higher 
risk  of  developing  resistance  to  raltegravir  (see  section 5.1).    In  all  patient  populations  raltegravir 
should be used in combination with at least one other active agent to enhance benefit and to reduce 
the risk of virologic failure and development of resistance to raltegravir. 
With a formal extension of the indication to ART-naïve subjects and taking into account the results of 
studies 032 and 033 the CHMP requested that this paragraph should now be replaced by the following: 
Raltegravir  has  a  relatively  low  genetic  barrier  to  resistance.  Therefore,  whenever  possible, 
raltegravir  should  be  administered  with  two  other  active  ARTs  to  minimise  the  potential  for 
virological failure and the development of resistance (see section 5.1). 
In  treatment  naïve  patients,  the  clinical  study  data  on  use  of  raltegravir  are  limited  to  use  in 
combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate). 
Correlation of viral suppression on raltegravir with co-administration of any specific ART 
Overall,  the  types  of  concomitant  therapies  used  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups. 
However,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  activity  of  these  regimens  in  patients  with  varied  prior  ART 
exposure because some patients may have had virus with pre-existing resistance mutations at baseline. 
Across  both  studies  the  most  commonly  used  NRTIs  were  either  emtricitabine  or  lamivudine  in 
combination with tenofovir or zidovudine or abacavir.  
Page 23 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In each study the difference in virological response rate between treatments was greatest among those 
patients  who  received  abacavir  +  emtricitabine  or  lamivudine.  What  is  more,  although  numbers  are 
relatively  small,  the  actual  rates  and  therefore  difference  in  rates  between  treatments  was  almost 
exactly  the  same  within  each  study  for  patients  who  received  these  ARTs  (i.e.  80%  vs.  95.7%  and 
81.8% vs. 94.7%). On looking at each study separately it also becomes clear that the lower response 
rates to raltegravir were more apparent in study 033 than in study 032.

Discussion 
These  analyses  show  a  particular  and  consistent  problem  for  use  of  raltegravir  with  abacavir  + 
emtricitabine or lamivudine despite the low denominators. This issue is discussed further below. The 
data  from  033  suggest  a  benefit  from  having  tenofovir  in  the  regimen  but  the  data  are  inconsistent 
between studies and do not allow for any firm conclusion that this is related to any possible effect of 
tenofovir on raltegravir exposure.  
Geno- & phenotype resistance at baseline 
The supplementary CRF was also used to request if information regarding pre-study resistance testing 
was available and if so, the nature of the results. Based on the limited amount of pre-study resistance 
testing  data  available  the  investigators  reported  that  in  179  patients  the  HIV  contained  mutations 
associated with resistance to at least one antiretroviral drug. Of these 179 patients, 59% (106/179) had 
virus  with  NNRTI  mutations,  70%  (126/179)  had  NRTI  mutations  and  75%  (134/179)  had  PI 
mutations.  It  is  unknown  how  many  of  the  remaining  523  patients  were  infected  with  HIV  that 
contained resistance mutations. 
Concentrating just on the 49 total patients who failed therapy, investigators reported that 14 of these 
patients had HIV that contained mutations associated with resistance to at least one ART. Of these 14 
patients,  57%  (8/14)  had  virus  with  NNRTI  mutations,  79%  (11/14)  had  NRTI  resistance,  and  86% 
(12/14)  had PI  mutations.  It  is unknown  how  many of  the  remaining  35  patients  were  infected  with 
HIV that contained resistance mutations. 
Looking specifically at the 32 patients who failed raltegravir therapy, there were only 8 patients with 
data who had virus with mutations associated with resistance to at least one ART. Of these 8 patients, 
38%  (3/8)  had  virus  with  NNRTI  mutations,  75%  (6/8)  had  NRTI  mutations  and  88%  (7/8)  had  PI 
mutations.  It  is  unknown  how  many  of  the  remaining  24  patients  were  infected  with  HIV  that 
contained resistance mutations. 
Overall, the MAH considered that the data from these analyses and from those reported above support 
the hypothesis that the increased rates of virological failure in the raltegravir groups in the two studies 
most  likely  reflect  compromised  activity  of  agents  in  the  backbone  regimen  due  to  viral  resistance. 
Thus the results are consistent with those in the studies in even more treatment experienced subjects 
(i.e. as in studies 005, 018 and 019) in which it was clear that virological response rates to raltegravir 
correlated with the number of agents in the OBT predicted to be active. 
The  MAH  maintained  that  the  results  of  studies  021  and  004  in  treatment-naïve  patients  provide 
unequivocal evidence of the efficacy of raltegravir in combination with two NRTIs in subjects infected 
with HIV that is susceptible to both the NRTIs.  
Discussion 
Based on the limited amount of pre-study resistance testing data available it becomes clear that rates of 
resistance-associated  mutations  (RAMs)  to  NRTIs,  NNRTIs  and  PIs  were  comparable  between  all 
patients with data and all failed patients with data. As far as can be discerned from the few raltegravir 
failures with data, the rates were also comparable for these eight patients. 
Implications for use in ART-experienced patients 
The increased risk of virological failure in the raltegravir groups in studies 032 and 033 most likely 
reflects compromised activity of one or more co-administered agents in the backbone regimen due to 
viral  resistance.  In  turn,  this  increased  the  risk  of  selecting  for  raltegravir-resistant  virus  during 
treatment.  Thus the results are consistent with those in the studies in even more treatment experienced 
subjects (i.e. as in studies 005, 018 and 019) in which it was clear that virological response rates to 
raltegravir correlated with the number of agents in the OBT predicted to be active. 
Page 25 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The need to combine raltegravir  with an active ART backbone is consistent  with the advice already 
included in Section 4.2 of the SPC, which cross-refers to sections 4.4 and 5.1.  
However, the CHMP requested that the SPC be updated to reflect the broadening of the indication and 
to advise that whenever possible raltegravir should be co-administered with at least two other agents 
predicted  to  be  active  (see  also  above).  In  addition,  section  5.1  was  updated  to  state  that  it  is  not 
recommended to switch patients who have achieved and maintained virological suppression on their 
current regimen to a raltegravir-based regimen.  
Implications for use in ART-naïve patients  
The findings in studies 032 and 033 do not affect the conclusions drawn from study 021 in treatment-
naïve  patients  for  use  of  raltegravir  in  conjunction  with  tenofovir/emtricitabine.  However,  initial 
therapy for HIV often involves use of tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine plus an NNRTI 
or  a  boosted  PI.  Studies  032  and  033  suggest  a  consistent  problem  with  the  use  of  raltegravir  plus 
abacavir + emtricitabine or lamivudine despite the low denominators.  
No PK interaction would explain the finding since there is no effect of co-administration of raltegravir 
with  lamivudine.  No  effect  would  be  expected  with  emtricitabine  and  any  interaction  with  abacavir 
might,  if  anything,  increase  plasma  levels  of  one  or  both  agents  due  to  competition  for 
glucuronyltransferase. In addition, there is no obvious mechanism for a pharmacodynamic interaction 
to occur between raltegravir and these NRTIs.   
Therefore  it  seems  most  likely  that  the  higher  risk  of  failure  on  an  abacavir-containing  regimen 
reflects  pre-existing  resistance  to  one  or  more  of  abacavir  and  emtricitabine/lamivudine  (for  which 
there is cross-resistance) leading to a particular risk of selecting for raltegravir-resistant virus during 
therapy. This should not be an issue for ART-naïve subjects unless they have acquired a resistant HIV 
de  novo.  In  addition,  data  from  study  021  suggest  that  pre-therapy  resistance  to  raltegravir  is  not 
currently problematical. 
Meanwhile the data from 032 and 033 strongly underline the need to administer raltegravir with other 
active agents to reduce the risk of virological failure, which in many but not all instances is associated 
with appearance of raltegravir RAMs. As already reflected in the SPC, studies 018 and 019 indicated 
that at least one other active agent was needed. Routine practise would suggest that whenever possible 
raltegravir should be co-administered with at least two other agents predicted to be active. Thus, the 
MAH agreed to update the SPC to reflect this need. 
that 
tenofovir/emtricitabine  might 
to 
The  data  also  suggest 
abacavir/lamivudine in terms of virologic suppression, in which case co-administration of raltegravir 
with abacavir/lamivudine might carry a higher risk of selecting for raltegravir resistance than would 
co-administration with tenofovir/emtricitabine. However, the data are not sufficient to make any clear 
recommendation  in  this  regard.  Therefore  there  are  no  grounds  at  present  to  restrict  the  use  of 
raltegravir  in  previously  ART-naïve  subjects  to  co-administration  with  tenofovir/emtricitabine. 
However, the SPC was modified to stress the limitations of the data provided by study 021. 
to  some  extent  be  superior 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As discussed in detail above, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4, as well as 5.1 of the SPC were updated to both 
include the new patient population of previously ART naïve patients, together with the results of the 
relevant clinical study, but also to underline both the limitations of the study in naïve patients (only 
one backbone therapy) as well as the low genetic barrier to resistance that raltegravir has. In addition, 
updated  information  about  additional  integrase  mutations  was  added  to  section  5.1,  as  well  as 
information about raltegravir’s non-B subtype antiviral activity in vitro.  
The  safety  analysis  of  the  trials  led  to  updates  in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC,  most  notably  to  a 
modification of the information of prevalence of cancer in the raltegravir arms of previous studies, as 
this trend could not be confirmed within the currently assessed studies. Nevertheless, skin papilloma 
Page 26 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was added to the list of at least possibly causally related adverse drug reactions with a frequency of 
“uncommon”.  
The findings of elevated unconjugated bilirubin show that, despite the in vitro findings, raltegravir has 
some capacity to inhibit UGT1A1 in some patients. Therefore, the statement in section 4.5 of the SPC 
in regards to the potential of raltegravir to inhibit the UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 
2B7  was  revised  to  mention  that  some  inhibition  of  UGT1A1  may  occur  in  vivo  based  on  effects 
observed on bilirubin glucuronidation. 
Also, upon request of the CHMP, the MAH added the information in section 4.5 that no interactions 
were observed when raltegravir was co-administered with etravirine, maraviroc and methadone. Even 
though  information  about  lack  of  interactions  is  normally  not  mentioned  in  this  section,  the  CHMP 
found  that  these  3  compounds  are  of  particular  interest  for  the  prescribing  physician  and  that  the 
information about their lack of interaction would be important to add in the SPC.  
The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance, especially section 4 “Possible Side Effects”, in line 
with the updates in section 4.8 of the SPC.  
Finally,  the  MAH  took  this  opportunity  to  update  the  contact  details  of  the  local  representative  in 
Iceland.  
6.  Overall conclusions and Benefit/Risk Assessment  
The MAH conducted a generally satisfactory single study (although provision of a second study would 
have provided a more robust demonstration of efficacy) to assess the safety and efficacy of raltegravir 
in  previously  ART-naïve  subjects.  The  submission  of  data  to  Week  48  and  the  size  of  the  database 
were considered to be acceptable in light of the results provided thus far and also taking into account 
the data already available in an ART-experienced population. The results available so far support the 
MAH’s claim for non-inferiority of the raltegravir based regimen when compared to the efavirenz one 
in  the  target  patient  population  of  ART-naïve  adult  patients.  The  Week  96  data  from  study  021  are 
expected end October 2009.  
The  comparative  regimen  of  efavirenz  plus  tenofovir  and  emtricitabine  (as  Truvada)  is  very  widely 
used in previously ART-naïve subjects and was a suitable choice for this study. While tenofovir may 
increase  plasma  exposure  to  raltegravir  it  seems  rather  unlikely  that  this  would  have  markedly 
augmented the efficacy of the raltegravir-containing regimen in study 021. This conclusion is based on 
the MAH’s population PK/PD analyses, which (although subject to several caveats due to paucity of 
samples  and  inherent  inter-subject  variation)  have  not  demonstrated  any  clear  and  consistent 
relationships between raltegravir PK parameters and virological responses in ART-naïve subjects.  
Questions  were  raised  regarding  extrapolation  of  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  for  raltegravir  when 
co-administered with tenofovir and emtricitabine (as Truvada, taken with food) to ART-naïve subjects 
to  other  potentially  useful  raltegravir-containing  regimens  in  this  population.  This  potential  concern 
over extrapolation was augmented by the interim data received from studies 032 and 033. Although 
these  studies  were  performed  in  ART-experienced  subjects  the  results  from  each  study  pointed  to  a 
particularly high risk of loss of virological suppression when patients were switched to raltegravir with 
abacavir + lamivudine or emtricitabine.  
Nevertheless,  it  seems  most  likely  that  the  higher  risk  of  failure  on  an  abacavir-containing  regimen 
reflected  pre-existing resistance to one or more of abacavir and emtricitabine/lamivudine (for which 
there is cross-resistance) leading to a particular risk of selecting for raltegravir-resistant virus during 
therapy. This should not be an issue for ART-naïve subjects unless they have acquired a resistant HIV 
de novo. Therefore there are no grounds at present to restrict the use of raltegravir in previously ART-
naïve  subjects  to  co-administration  with  Truvada.  However,  the  SPC  was  modified  to  stress  the 
limitations of the data provided by study 021. 
Page 27 of 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The data received from studies 032 and 033 also underlined the continuing concern regarding the low 
genetic  barrier  for  resistance  to  raltegravir.  Previous  data  suggested  that  the  risk  of  selecting  for 
raltegravir-resistant  virus  was  higher  when  it  was  used  as  functional  monotherapy  or  with  only  one 
other agent predicted to be active. The data from 032 and 033 strongly suggest that failure to maintain 
viral  suppression  after  switching  to  a  raltegravir-based  regimen  was  associated  with  use  of  a  sub-
optimal total ART regimen due to pre-existing resistance. This situation is much less likely to occur in 
the  ART-naïve  population.  In  addition,  data  from  treatment  experienced  patients  not  previously 
exposed to raltegravir suggest a low risk of pre-existing raltegravir RAMs. 
Study 021 indicated that the safety profile of raltegravir + Truvada was generally comparable to that of 
efavirenz  +  Truvada.  The  increases  in  total  and  indirect  bilirubin  in  the  raltegravir  group  point  to  a 
conclusion that the in vitro data indicating lack of inhibition of UGT1A1 by raltegravir are not borne 
out in the clinic and the SPC was  modified accordingly.  
The data on rates of malignancies, taken in conjunction with the update provided in variation II/01, are 
reassuring.  Variation  II/10  was  filed  concurrently  with  provision  of  the  results  of  the  non  clinical 
carcinogenicity  studies  (II/009)  and  a  separate  report  had  been  issued  (CHMP  Opinion  issued  on 
23 April 2009). Taking into account the conclusions from that report, it was agreed that removal of the 
paragraph on malignancies from section 4.4 was now possible. The paragraph in Section 4.8 remained, 
but with some amendment.  
The use of pH altering agents in the raltegravir group did seem to be associated with higher rates of 
some AEs. While the analysis is indeed severely limited the rates of clinical and laboratory AEs were 
higher in those taking concomitant pH-altering agents. In this regard, the MAH will conduct a study of 
the effects of omeprazole in HIV-infected subjects (see study 054; report on FUM 022). Meanwhile, 
the  current  SPC  advice  to  use  raltegravir  with  agents  that  increase  gastric  pH  only  if  unavoidable 
remains appropriate. 
Overall, the data recently made available from studies 032 and 033 do not have a direct impact on the 
suitability of raltegravir for previously ART-naïve subjects.  
The  CHMP  therefore  concluded  that  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  the  extension  of  indication  of 
raltegravir to add ART-naïve patients is positive.  
While  the  use  of  raltegravir  in  ART-naïve  patients  is  considered  to  be  approvable,  there  are 
insufficient data to be able to conclude that raltegravir-containing regimens that might be used in the 
ART-naïve  would  provide  a  significant  benefit  in  terms  of  safety  or  efficacy  compared  to  other 
suitable regimens for this patient population. Therefore it is not possible to agree that the data support 
an additional year of  marketing protection based on the new therapeutic indication for raltegravir in 
treatment naïve patients (see also the Attachment to this Assessment Report). 
6.  Outcome  
On  23  July  2009  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.  
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH taking into account the provisions 
of  Article  14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004,  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the 
“Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing 
therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing 
protection period (November 2007)”, and did not consider that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  therapies  (see  the  Attachment  to  this 
Assessment Report).

1. Introduction 
The  MAH  Merck  Sharp  &  Dohme  Ltd.  submitted  on  8  October  2008  an  extension  of  indication 
variation  application  for  Isentress  (raltegravir)  adding  treatment  naïve  patients  to  the  existing 
population of antiretroviral experienced HIV-infected adults.  
With submission of this extension of indication application in treatment naïve patients the MAH also 
applied  for  an  additional  one  year  marketing  protection  period  in  accordance  with  Article  14(11)  of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
2. Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by the applicant 
Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy  
Although  several  recommended  regimens  are  available  for  the  initial  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection 
patient and provider preferences, underlying co-morbidities, acute adverse drug effects and long-term 
complications continue to limit the  success of  ART  in patients who are naïve to therapy. Moreover, 
significant drug resistance mutations, particularly to NNRTIs, are increasingly prevalent in the ART-
naïve population and drug interactions among ARTs provide challenges to prescribing and monitoring 
therapy  for  these  patients.  There  is  a  need  for  new  agents  and  drug  classes  in  order  to  expand  the 
options  for  the  initial  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  and  maximise  the  probability  of  achieving  and 
maintaining optimal virological suppression and immune reconstitution with first-line regimens. 
Data from the phase III study in treatment-naïve patients (Protocol 021) demonstrated that raltegravir 
has  potent  and  durable  antiretroviral  and  immunological  effects  in  treatment-naïve  patients.  In 
addition, it has an excellent safety and tolerability profile. In this study raltegravir was  compared to 
efavirenz, both in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine. The results demonstrated statistically non-
inferior  efficacy  compared  to  efavirenz  at  Week  48  in  treatment-naïve  patients.  Compared  to 
efavirenz, a numerically higher proportion achieved HIV RNA suppression to < 50 copies/ml as early 
as Week 2 and remained higher through Week 48.  
The  raltegravir-containing  regimen  resulted  in  greater  immunological  effect  as  measured  by  the 
change  from  baseline  in  CD4  cell  count  compared  to  the  efavirenz-containing  regimen.  Consistent 
efficacy  was  observed  across  important  subgroups  including  patients  with  baseline  CD4  cell  counts 
≤200  cells/mm3  and  viral  RNA  >  100,000  copies/ml,  patients  infected  with  non-clade  B  virus,  and 
patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C. 
The resistance profile of raltegravir was evaluated by performing genotypic analysis of the integrase 
coding region in patients who had virological failure in both Protocol 021 and Protocol 004. Overall, 
there  were  few  treatment  failures  in  these  studies.  Resistance  evaluation  was  done  for  patients  who 
were protocol defined virological failures and who also had HIV RNA > 400 copies/ml, the standard 
limit  for  routine  genotyping  assays.  In  the  treatment  naïve  studies  (Protocol  021  and  004),  samples 
were evaluable from 15 patients who failed therapy in the raltegravir groups and 10 from the efavirenz 
groups. In the raltegravir groups approximately half did not have any detectable changes in integrase 
correlating with reduced susceptibility.  
Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety  
Review  of  the  double-blind  treatment-naïve  population  receiving  raltegravir  showed  that  the  overall 
clinical  adverse  experience  profile  was  consistent  with  that  previously  described  in  treatment-
experienced patients. Numbers (%) of patients with AEs and with drug-related AEs, in the raltegravir 
group were significantly lower than for the efavirenz group based on the nominal p-values (0.002 and 
<0.001, respectively). There were no other statistically significant differences between the two groups. 
Discontinuations  due  to  clinical  adverse  experiences  were  uncommon  but  slightly  higher  in  the 
efavirenz  group  (3.2%  [9/281]  versus  6.0%  [17/282]).  In  a  pre-specified  analysis,  the  proportion  of 
1/4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with one or more central nervous system symptoms accumulated up to week 8 as well as week 
48 was significantly lower in the raltegravir group. 
Detailed review of the laboratory adverse experiences and laboratory abnormalities demonstrated that 
the  laboratory  safety  profile  of  raltegravir  in  treatment-naïve  patients  is  consistent  with  the  overall 
safety  profile  reported  previously.  Since  many  antiretroviral  agents  have  unfavourable  effects  on 
lipids, a pre-specified analysis of the change from baseline in serum lipids was performed. Through 48 
weeks  of  therapy,  raltegravir  demonstrated  minimal  effects  on  serum  lipids  with  small  increases  in 
total, LDL and non-HDL cholesterol and a decrease in serum triglycerides. In contrast, the efavirenz-
treated group had statistically significantly higher percent increases in total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-
HDL-C and triglycerides. Modest increases in HDL were observed in both groups, significantly higher 
for efavirenz. Body composition, measured by DEXA scan, showed no evidence of lipodystrophy or 
lipoatrophy in patients treated with raltegravir for 48 weeks. 
Last, the updated malignancy data including Protocol 021 demonstrated that there is no specific cancer 
risk  associated  with  raltegravir  treatment  as  noted  in  the  conclusions  reached  in  the  48  Week 
Treatment Experienced Supplemental Application. 
Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
According to current HIV treatment guidelines efavirenz, which is recommended in combination with 
two  NRTIs  for  initial  therapy  of  HIV  infection,  has  demonstrated  durable  efficacy  and  a  favourable 
adverse event profile. In this application, raltegravir has demonstrated potent and durable antiretroviral 
and immunological effects in treatment-naïve patients, with a better tolerability and safety profile than 
efavirenz. 
Additionally, raltegravir is active against virus resistant to NNRTIs and PIs and will be an important 
treatment  option  in  patients  infected  with  resistant  virus.  Raltegravir  does  not  interact  with  the 
cytochrome  P-450  system  and  has  a  favourable  drug  interaction  profile  and  does  not  require  dose 
adjustment  when  co-administered  with  commonly  prescribed  antiretroviral  therapies.  This  simplifies 
dosing  instructions,  facilitating  compliance  which  plays  an  important  role  in  maintaining  complete 
viral suppression. 
These  results  demonstrate  that  raltegravir  is  an  important  addition  to  the  HIV  treatment-naïve 
armamentarium and an important new treatment option for first-line therapy of HIV-infected patients.  
3. Assessment of the applicant’s justification of significant clinical benefit   
Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
The  data  from  study  021  showed  that  the  specific  combination  regimen  of  raltegravir  + 
tenofovir/emtricitabine is as effective as efavirenz + tenofovir/emtricitabine in treatment naïve patients 
but it cannot be concluded that the raltegravir regimen is significantly improved when compared to the 
latter. Over the total treatment period the results for both groups were generally comparable and it was 
only in the very first weeks that there might be an advantage for raltegravir.  
It  is  understood  that  the  regulation  states  that  even  without  showing  greater  efficacy  a  medicinal 
product could be considered to confer significant clinical benefit if it acts through a different principal 
mechanism of action and thus provides a treatment alternative or it produces a response different from 
other treatments in a substantial part of the targeted population. In this respect it is therefore important 
to note that, although it has a different mechanism of action, based on the numbers available there was 
no advantage for raltegravir over efavirenz in the populations with the highest viral loads and lowest 
CD4 counts at baseline.  
In  addition,  there  are  doubts  raised  on  the  extrapolation  of  results  with  this  specific  raltegravir-
containing regimen to other possible combination regimens. While the MAH repeatedly claims a low 
2/4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential for drug-drug interaction it has been discussed previously that the very large inter-individual 
variation in PK could be the result of many factors that have not yet been identified. Therefore much 
caution is needed in assuming that any raltegravir-containing regimen would provide similar efficacy 
to that observed in study 021 in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine. 
Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
The  MAH’s  arguments  focus  almost  completely  on  comparisons  between  raltegravir  and  efavirenz 
when  each  is  given  in  combination  with  tenofovir/emtricitabine.  While  the  efavirenz-containing 
regimen  is  widely  used  it  is  by  no  means  the  only  possible  primary  regimen  and  therefore  it  is  not 
appropriate  to  conclude  that  the  specific  raltegravir  regimen  studied  would  necessarily  have  a  better 
safety profile than other useful first-line regimens.  
To focus so heavily on the comparison with efavirenz is considered to be inappropriate. Indeed, if the 
CNS effects are separated it would not appear that there is any significant benefit for the raltegravir 
regimen in terms of clinical AEs. While the rates of lipid abnormalities were lower for the raltegravir 
regimen  versus  the  efavirenz  regimen  there  were  many  other  laboratory  data  that  did  not  show  a 
difference between regimens and there was a higher rate of elevations in bilirubin with raltegravir that 
may reflect inhibition of UGT1A1. 
Generally, a comparison against a single regimen with respect to specific types of adverse event must 
be viewed with much caution.  
Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
Again  the  MAH  focuses  strongly  on  a  claim  that  raltegravir  has  demonstrated  antiretroviral  and 
immunological  effects  and  a  better  tolerability  and  safety  profile  than  efavirenz.  These  claims  are 
anyway  not  considered  to  be  wholly  justified  and  the  picture  may  be  different  for  alternative 
raltegravir-containing  regimens  and/or  comparisons  with  other  first-line  regimens  suitable  for  the 
ART-naïve. 
In addition, the MAH stresses that raltegravir is active against virus resistant to NNRTIs and PIs and 
will be an important treatment option in patients infected with resistant virus. At the same time though 
the  risk  of  selecting  for  raltegravir-resistant  virus  must  be  borne  in  mind  and  much  more  data  are 
needed in larger numbers and over longer periods before the true risk can be assessed.  
While the MAH claims that raltegravir has a favourable drug interaction profile and does not require 
dose  adjustment  when  co-administered  with  commonly  prescribed  antiretroviral  therapies  it  is 
necessary  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  reasons  for  the  large  intra-  and  inter-individual  variability  in  PK 
remain  poorly  understood  and  could  in  part  reflect  issues  such  as  interferences  at  the  level  of 
absorption. In addition, the effects on bilirubin could reflect a clinically important effect on UGT1A1 
despite the nonclinical study predictions that inhibition was unlikely to occur in man at the approved 
dose.  
4. CHMP Conclusion 
Overall,  there  are  insufficient  data  to  be  able  to  conclude  that  raltegravir-containing  regimens  that 
might  be  used  in  the  ART-naïve  patients  would  provide  a  significant  benefit  in  terms  of  safety  or 
efficacy compared to other suitable regimens for this patient population. Therefore it is not possible to 
agree  that  the  data  support  an  additional  year  of  marketing  protection  based  on  the  new  therapeutic 
indication for raltegravir in treatment naïve patients. 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy and safety results supported a positive benefit risk balance for 
the extension of indication application for Isentress in treatment naïve patients. However, the lack of 
proof  of  superior  efficacy  results  in  the  submitted  trial  did  not  support  the  claim  for  a  significant 
efficacy  benefit.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  considered  the  safety  profile  of  raltegravir  not  to  be 
3/4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significantly better. Finally, the CHMP judged the provided justification on improved patient care to 
not be sufficiently substantiated.  
Overall,  in  the  absence  of  significant  clinical  benefit  based  on  improved  efficacy,  safety  and 
contribution  to  patient  care,  in  comparison  both  to  the  comparator  as  well  as  other  antiretroviral 
medicines  indicated  for  treatment  naïve  patients,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  justification  for  an 
additional  year  of  marketing  protection  was  insufficient.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  did  not  support  the 
MAH’s  justification  for  an  additional  year  of  marketing  protection  based  on  the  new  therapeutic 
indication for Isentress in treatment naïve patients. 
5. Outcome 
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant taking into account the provisions of Article 
14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004,  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  “Guidance  on 
elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a 
new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period 
(November 2007)”, and did not consider that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical 
benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
VELCADE as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or 
dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who 
have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
VELCADE in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy 
with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated
for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are
eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
VELCADE in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are 
unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
VELCADE treatment must be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment 
of cancer patients, however VELCADE may be administered by a healthcare professional experienced 
in use of chemotherapeutic agents. VELCADE must be reconstituted by a healthcare professional (see 
section 6.6).
Posology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy)
Monotherapy
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous injection at the
recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and
11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. It is recommended 
that patients receive 2 cycles of VELCADE following a confirmation of a complete response. It is also 
recommended that responding patients who do not achieve a complete remission receive a total of 
2
8 cycles of VELCADE therapy. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of 
VELCADE.
Dose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy
VELCADE treatment must be withheld at the onset of any Grade 3 non-haematological or any 
Grade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4). 
Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, VELCADE treatment may be re-initiated at a 
25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2; 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the toxicity 
is not resolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of VELCADE must be considered 
unless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk.
Neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy
Patients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to be 
managed as presented in Table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy may 
be treated with VELCADE only after careful risk/benefit assessment.

cycle as a 1 hour intravenous infusion administered after the VELCADE injection.
Up to 8 cycles of this combination therapy can be administered as long as patients have not progressed 
and tolerate treatment. Patients achieving a complete response can continue treatment for at least 
2 cycles after the first evidence of complete response, even if this requires treatment for more than 
8 cycles. Patients whose levels of paraprotein continue to decrease after 8 cycles can also continue for 
as long as treatment is tolerated and they continue to respond.
For additional information concerning pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, see the corresponding 
Summary of Product Characteristics.
Combination with dexamethasone
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous injection at the 
recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 
3
11 in a 21 day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours 
should elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.
Dexamethasone is administered orally at 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the VELCADE 
treatment cycle.
Patients achieving a response or a stable disease after 4 cycles of this combination therapy can 
continue to receive the same combination for a maximum of 4 additional cycles.


If several VELCADE doses in a cycle are 
withheld (≥ 3 doses during twice weekly 
administration or ≥ 2 doses during weekly 
administration)
Grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicities 
VELCADE dose should be reduced by 1 dose 
level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 
1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2)
VELCADE therapy should be withheld until 
symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to 
Grade 1 or baseline. Then, VELCADE may be 
reinitiated with one dose level reduction (from 
1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 
0.7 mg/m2). For VELCADE-related neuropathic 
pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or 
modify VELCADE as outlined in Table 1.
For additional information concerning melphalan and prednisone, see the corresponding Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

Dosage adjustments for transplant eligible patients
For VELCADE dosage adjustments, dose modification guidelines described for monotherapy should 
be followed.
In addition, when VELCADE is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose reductions for these products should be considered in the event of toxicities 
according to the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
Posology for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
Combination therapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (VcR-CAP)
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous injection at the 
recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 
11, followed by a 10-day rest period on days 12-21. This 3-week period is considered a treatment 
cycle. Six VELCADE cycles are recommended, although for patients with a response first 
documented at cycle 6, two additional VELCADE cycles may be given. At least 72 hours should 
elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.
The following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each VELCADE 3 week treatment 
cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and 
doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2.
Prednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each VELCADE treatment 
cycle.
Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma
Prior to initiating a new cycle of therapy:

Platelet counts should be ≥ 100,000 cells/μL and the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) should 
be ≥ 1,500 cells/μL
Platelet counts should be ≥ 75,000 cells/μL in patients with bone marrow infiltration or splenic 
sequestration
Haemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL
Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.



VELCADE treatment must be withheld at the onset of any ≥ Grade 3 VELCADE-related 
non-haematological toxicities (excluding neuropathy) or ≥ Grade 3 haematological toxicities (see also 
section 4.4). For dose adjustments, see Table 5 below.
Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to 
local standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be 
considered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration. Platelet transfusion for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia should be considered when clinically appropriate.

Toxicity
Haematological toxicity 
 ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting more than 7 days, a 
platelet count < 10,000 cells/μL
 If platelet counts < 25,000 cells/μL. or ANC 
< 750 cells/μL on a VELCADE dosing day 
(other than Day 1 of each cycle)
Grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicities 
considered to be related to VELCADE
Posology modification or delay
VELCADE therapy should be withheld for up to 
2 weeks until the patient has an ANC 
≥ 750 cells/μL and a platelet count 
≥ 25,000 cells/μL.
 If, after VELCADE has been held, the 
toxicity does not resolve, as defined above, 
then VELCADE must be discontinued.
 If toxicity resolves i.e. patient has an ANC 
≥ 750 cells/μL and a platelet count 
≥ 25,000 cells/μL, VELCADE may be 
reinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose 
level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 
1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2).
VELCADE therapy should be withheld
VELCADE therapy should be withheld until 
symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to 
Grade 2 or better. Then, VELCADE may be 
reinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level 
(from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 
0.7 mg/m2). For VELCADE-related neuropathic 
pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or 
modify VELCADE as outlined in Table 1.
In addition, when VELCADE is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the event 
of toxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics.
Special populations
Elderly
There is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age
with multiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma.
There are no studies on the use of VELCADE in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Therefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population.
In a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients 
exposed to VELCADE were in the range 65-74 years and ≥ 75 years of age, respectively. In patients 
aged ≥ 75 years, both regimens, VcR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see section 4.8).
Hepatic impairment
Patients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per the 
recommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on 
VELCADE at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a
subsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered 
based on patient tolerability (see Table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are not influenced in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (Creatinine Clearance [CrCL] > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2); therefore, dose adjustments are not 
necessary for these patients. It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced in 
patients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). Since 
dialysis may reduce bortezomib concentrations, VELCADE should be administered after the dialysis 
procedure (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in children below 18 years of age have not been established 
(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made.
Method of administration
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous administration only.
VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or subcutaneous 
administration.
VELCADE should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death.
Intravenous injection
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is for intravenous administration only. The 
reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection through a peripheral 
or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.
When VELCADE is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease.
When VELCADE is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their Summaries of 
Product Characteristics for additional contraindications.

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When VELCADE is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment with 
VELCADE. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention 
requirements is needed (see section 4.6).
Intrathecal administration
There have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of VELCADE. VELCADE 1 mg 
powder for solution for injection is for intravenous use only, while VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for 
solution for injection is for intravenous or subcutaneous use. VELCADE should not be administered 
intrathecally.
Gastrointestinal toxicity
Gastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common 
with VELCADE treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, patients who experience constipation should be closely monitored.
Haematological toxicity
VELCADE treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and anaemia). In studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with 
VELCADE and in patients with previously untreated MCL treated with VELCADE in combination 
with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP), one of the most 
common haematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. Platelets were lowest at Day 11 of 
each cycle of VELCADE treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. There was 
no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia. The mean platelet count nadir measured was 
approximately 40% of baseline in the single-agent multiple myeloma studies and 50% in the MCL 
study. In patients with advanced myeloma the severity of thrombocytopenia was related to 
pre-treatment platelet count: for baseline platelet counts < 75,000/l, 90% of 21 patients had a count 
≤ 25,000/l during the study, including 14% < 10,000/l; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count 
> 75,000/l, only 14% of 309 patients had a count ≤ 25,000/l during the study.
In patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of 
Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in the VELCADE treatment group (VcR-CAP) as compared to the 
non-VELCADE treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence of 
all-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the VcR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well as 
Grade 3 and higher bleeding events (VcR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In the 
VcR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients in the 
R-CHOP group.
Gastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with VELCADE 
treatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of VELCADE. 
VELCADE therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/l or, in the case of 
combination with melphalan and prednisone, when the platelet count is ≤ 30,000/l (see section 4.2).
Potential benefit of the treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in case of 
moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding.
Complete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently 
monitored throughout treatment with VELCADE. Platelet transfusion should be considered when
clinically appropriate (see section 4.2).
In patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with no 
evidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of VELCADE 
treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, colony
stimulating factor support was given to 78% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm and 61% of patients in 
the R-CHOP arm. Since patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, they should be 
9
monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte colony stimulating 
factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. 
Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered in case of repeated 
delays in cycle administration (see section 4.2).
Herpes zoster virus reactivation
Antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with VELCADE.
In the Phase III study in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence of 
herpes zoster reactivation was more common in patients treated with 
VELCADE+Melphalan+Prednisone compared with Melphalan+Prednisone (14% versus 4% 
respectively).
In patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the 
VcR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8).
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection
When rituximab is used in combination with VELCADE, HBV screening must always be performed 
in patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis B and 
patients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of 
active HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment with VELCADE. 
Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
rituximab for more information.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Very rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML 
and death, have been reported in patients treated with VELCADE. Patients diagnosed with PML had 
prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months 
of their first dose of VELCADE. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of the differential 
diagnosis of CNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be referred to a 
specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. Discontinue
VELCADE if PML is diagnosed.
Peripheral neuropathy
Treatment with VELCADE is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is 
predominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory peripheral 
neuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early in the 
treatment and has been observed to peak during cycle 5.
It is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a burning 
sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness.
Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo neurological evaluation 
and may require a change in the dose or schedule of VELCADE (see section 4.2). Neuropathy has 
been managed with supportive care and other therapies.
Early and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological 
evaluation should be considered in patients receiving VELCADE in combination with medicinal 
products known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose reduction or 
treatment discontinuation should be considered.
In addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some 
adverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on 
autonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited.
Seizures
Seizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or epilepsy. 
Special care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures.
10
Hypotension
VELCADE treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse 
reactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who 
developed orthostatic hypotension on VELCADE (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of 
orthostatic hypotension prior to treatment with VELCADE. Most patients required treatment for their 
orthostatic hypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced syncopal 
events. Orthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of VELCADE. The 
mechanism of this event is unknown although a component may be due to autonomic neuropathy. 
Autonomic neuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may aggravate an underlying 
condition such as diabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised when treating patients with a 
history of syncope receiving medicinal products known to be associated with hypotension; or who are 
dehydrated due to recurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension 
may include adjustment of antihypertensive medicinal products, rehydration or administration of 
mineralocorticosteroids and/or sympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical 
advice if they experience symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving VELCADE. PRES is a rare, often reversible,
rapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, 
lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, 
preferably Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients 
developing PRES, VELCADE should be discontinued.
Heart failure
Acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be a 
predisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or existing 
heart disease should be closely monitored.
Electrocardiogram investigations
There have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not been 
established.
Pulmonary disorders
There have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology such 
as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) in patients receiving VELCADE (see section 4.8). Some of these events have been fatal. A 
pre-treatment chest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential post-treatment 
pulmonary changes.
In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic 
evaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio should be 
considered prior to continuing VELCADE therapy.
In a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous 
infusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and VELCADE for relapsed acute myelogenous leukaemia 
died of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, this specific 
regimen with concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous 
infusion over 24 hours is not recommended.
Renal impairment
Renal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal impairment
should be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
11
Hepatic impairment
Bortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with VELCADE at reduced 
doses and closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Hepatic reactions
Rare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving VELCADE and concomitant 
medicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic reactions 
include increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may be 
reversible upon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8).
Tumour lysis syndrome
Because bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells and MCL cells,
the complications of tumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome 
are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and 
appropriate precautions taken.
Concomitant medicinal products
Patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent 
CYP3A4-inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when bortezomib is combined with CYP3A4- or 
CYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5).
Normal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving oral 
hypoglycemics (see section 4.5).
Potentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions
Potentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis 
with rash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib should be 
discontinued if serious reactions occur.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 
1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to the metabolism 
of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect the overall 
disposition of bortezomib.
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 
35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely 
monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
ritonavir).
In a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on 
the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients.
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction 
of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong 
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is 
not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced.
In the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 
inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients.
12
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of 
bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data 
from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant.
During clinical trials, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were uncommonly and commonly reported in 
diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving 
VELCADE treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of the 
dose of their antidiabetics.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Contraception in males and females
Male and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures during 
and for 3 months following treatment.
Pregnancy
No clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The 
teratogenic potential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated.
In non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and rabbits 
at the highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of bortezomib on 
parturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). VELCADE should not be 
used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with VELCADE.
If VELCADE is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this 
medicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus.
Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth 
defects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
unless all the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. Patients 
receiving VELCADE in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention 
programme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of thalidomide for 
additional information.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
VELCADE.
Fertility
Fertility studies were not conducted with VELCADE (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
VELCADE may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. VELCADE may 
be associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope uncommonly and 
orthostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, patients must be cautious 
when driving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if they 
experience these symptoms (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Serious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with VELCADE include cardiac 
failure, tumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with VELCADE are nausea, 
diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, 
13
peripheral neuropathy (including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, rash, 
herpes zoster and myalgia.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
Multiple Myeloma
Undesirable effects in Table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or 
probable causal relationship to VELCADE. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data set 
of 5,476 patients of whom 3,996 were treated with VELCADE at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in Table 7.
Overall, VELCADE was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients.
Adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are 
defined as: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. Table 7 has been generated using Version 14.1 of the MedDRA.
Post-marketing adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials are also included.

Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
The safety profile of VELCADE in 240 MCL patients treated with VELCADE at 1.3 mg/m2 in 
combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP), versus 
242 patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
[R-CHOP] was relatively consistent to that observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main 
differences described below. Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of 
the combination therapy (VcR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia 
(1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse 
drug reactions are not attributable to VELCADE alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient 
population as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a ≥ 5% higher incidence of 
the haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, 
lymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hair 
disorders.
Adverse drug reactions identified as those with a ≥ 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the 
VcR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the 
VcR-CAP arm, are listed in Table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in the 
VcR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal 
relationship to VELCADE based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies.
Adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are 
defined as: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. Table 8 has been generated using Version 16 of the MedDRA.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Herpes zoster virus reactivation
Multiple Myeloma
Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 26% of the patients in the Vc+M+P arm. The incidence of 
herpes zoster among patients in the Vc+M+P treatment group was 17% for patients not administered 
antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis.
Mantle cell lymphoma
Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 137 of 240 patients (57%) in the VcR-CAP arm. The 
incidence of herpes zoster among patients in the VcR-CAP arm was 10.7% for patients not 
administered antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3.6% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis
(see section 4.4).
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection
Mantle cell lymphoma
HBV infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients in the non-VELCADE 
treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP ) 
and 0.4% (n=1) of patients receiving VELCADE in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP). The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections was similar 
in patients treated with VcR-CAP or with R-CHOP (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively).
Peripheral neuropathy in combination regimens
Multiple Myeloma
In trials in which VELCADE was administered as induction treatment in combination with
dexamethasone (study IFM-2005-01), and dexamethasone-thalidomide (study MMY-3010), the 
incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the combination regimens is presented in the table below:

42.9% and 10.4% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm were in the range 65-74 years and ≥ 75 years of 
age, respectively. Although in patients aged ≥ 75 years, both VcR-CAP and R-CHOP were less 
tolerated, the serious adverse event rate in the VcR-CAP groups was 68%, compared to 42% in the 
R-CHOP group.
Retreatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma
In a study in which VELCADE retreatment was administered in 130 patients with relapsed multiple 
myeloma, who previously had at least partial response on a VELCADE-containing regimen, the most 
common all-grade adverse events occurring in at least 25% of patients were thrombocytopenia (55%), 
neuropathy (40%), anaemia (37%), diarrhoea (35%), and constipation (28%). All grade peripheral 
neuropathy and grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 40% and 8.5% of patients, 
respectively.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9 Overdose
In patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute onset 
of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology studies, see section 5.3.
There is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient’s 
vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood pressure (such 
as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XG01.
Mechanism of action
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like 
activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex 
that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in 
regulating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of 
the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within 
the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death.
Bortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 M concentrations, bortezomib does not 
inhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more 
selective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome inhibition 
were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome with a t½ of 
20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible.
Bortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but 
not limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 
NF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, 
including cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, 
bortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.
Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and that 
cancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal cells. 
Bortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour models, including 
multiple myeloma.
Data from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast 
differentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in 
patients with multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with 
bortezomib.
Clinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma
A prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 
VISTA) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2 injected 
intravenously) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in 
improvement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone 
(60 mg/m2) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a 
maximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% were male, 88% 
were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80. Patients 
21
had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median hemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a 
median platelet count of 221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients had creatinine clearance 
≤ 30 ml/min (3% in each arm).
At the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, time to progression, was met and 
patients in the M+P arm were offered Vc+M+P treatment. Median follow-up was 16.3 months. The 
final survival update was performed with a median duration of follow-up of 60.1 months. A 
statistically significant survival benefit in favour of the Vc+M+P treatment group was observed 
(HR=0.695; p=0.00043) despite subsequent therapies including VELCADE-based regimens. Median 
survival for the Vc+M+P treatment group was 56.4 months compared to 43.1 for the M+P treatment 
group. Efficacy results are presented in Table 11:

Patients eligible for stem cell transplantation
Two randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase III trials (IFM-2005-01, MMY-3010) were conducted 
to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of VELCADE in dual and triple combinations with other 
chemotherapeutic agents, as induction therapy prior to stem cell transplantation in patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma.
In study IFM-2005-01 VELCADE combined with dexamethasone [VcDx, n=240] was compared to 
vincristine- doxorubicin-dexamethasone [VDDx, n=242]. Patients in the VcDx group received four 
21 day cycles, each consisting of VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly on 
days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in Cycles 1 
and 2, and on days 1 to 4 in Cycles 3 and 4).
Autologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in the 
VDDx and VcDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant 
procedure. Patient demographic and baseline disease charateristics were similar between the treatment 
groups. Median age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of patients had 
high-risk cytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx group and 
11 weeks for the VcDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups was 4 cycles.
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR). A statistically 
significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the VELCADE combined with 
dexamethasone group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included post-transplant response rates
(CR+nCR, CR+nCR+VGPR+PR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Main efficacy 
results are presented in Table 12.

In study MMY-3010 induction treatment withVELCADE combined with thalidomide and 
dexamethasone [VcTDx, n=130] was compared to thalidomide-dexamethasone [TDx, n=127]. Patients 
in the VcTDx group received six 4-week cycles, each consisting of VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2
administered twice weekly days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a 17-day rest period from day 12 to 
day 28), dexamethasone (40 mg administered orally on days 1 to 4 and days 8 to 11), and thalidomide 
(administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14, increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and thereafter to 
200 mg daily).
One single autologous stem cell transplant was received by 105 (81%) patients and 78 (61%) patients 
in the VcTDx and TDx groups, respectively. Patient demographic and baseline disease charateristics 
were similar between the treatment groups. Patients in the VcTDx and TDx groups respectively had a
median age of 57 versus 56 years, 99% versus 98% patients were Caucasians, and 58% versus 54% 
were males. In the VcTDx group 12% of patients were cytogenetically classified as high risk versus 
16% of patients in the TDx group. The median duration of treatment was 24.0 weeks and the median 
number of treatment cycles received was 6.0, and was consistent across treatment groups.
The primary efficacy endpoints of the study were post-induction and post-transplant response rates 
(CR+nCR). A statistically significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the VELCADE
combined with dexamethasone and thalidomide group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 
Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Main efficacy results are presented in Table 13.

Clinical efficacy in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
The safety and efficacy of VELCADE (injected intravenously) were evaluated in 2 studies at the 
recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2: a Phase III randomised, comparative study (APEX), versus 
dexamethasone (Dex), of 669 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 
1-3 prior lines of therapy, and a Phase II single-arm study of 202 patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who had received at least 2 prior lines of treatment and who were progressing on 
their most recent treatment.
In the Phase III study, treatment with VELCADE led to a significantly longer time to progression, a 
significantly prolonged survival and a significantly higher response rate, compared to treatment with 
dexamethasone (see Table 14), in all patients as well as in patients who have received 1 prior line of 
therapy. As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at the 
recommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to dexamethasone were 
then offered VELCADE, regardless of disease status. Due to this early crossover, the median duration 
of follow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients who were refractory to their last 
prior therapy and those who were not refractory, overall survival was significantly longer and response 
rate was significantly higher on the VELCADE arm.
Of the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well as 
TTP remained significantly better for VELCADE independently of age. Regardless of

2-microglobulin levels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (time to progression and overall survival, 
as well as response rate) were significantly improved on the VELCADE arm.
In the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent 
review committee and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow Transplant 
Group. The median survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ months). This 
survival was greater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by consultant clinical 
investigators for a similar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response rate was 
independent of myeloma type, performance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the number or 
type of previous therapies. Patients who had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had a response 
rate of 32% (10/32) and patients who received greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens had a response 
rate of 31% (21/67).

In the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with VELCADE 
alone were able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with VELCADE. The protocol 
allowed patients to receive dexamethasone if they had had a less than optimal response to VELCADE 
alone. A total of 74 evaluable patients were administered dexamethasone in combination with 
VELCADE. Eighteen percent of patients achieved, or had an improved response [MR (11%) or PR 
(7%)] with combination treatment.

VELCADE combination treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (study DOXIL-MMY-3001)
A Phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 646 patients 
comparing the safety and efficacy of VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus
VELCADE monotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 prior therapy 
and who did not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was TTP while the secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), using the European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.
A protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination for 
efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45% (95% CI; 29-57%, p < 0.0001) for 
patients treated with combination therapy of VELCADE and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The 
median TTP was 6.5 months for the VELCADE monotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for 
the VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. These results, 
though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis.
The final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant 
difference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; 
25.2-36.5 months) for the VELCADE monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 
28.9-37.1 months) for the VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy 
patients.
VELCADE combination treatment with dexamethasone
In the absence of any direct comparison between VELCADE and VELCADE in combination with 
dexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis was 
conducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of VELCADE in combination with 
dexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the VELCADE 
monotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL 
MMY-3001) in the same indication.
The matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. 
VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. 
VELCADE) are made comparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study 
subjects. This minimises the effects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects using 
non-randomised data.
One hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis demonstrated 
improved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS (hazard ratio 0.511; 
95% CI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; p=0.001) for 
VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone over VELCADE monotherapy.
Limited information on VELCADE retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available.
Phase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine 
the efficacy and safety of retreatment with VELCADE. One hundred and thirty patients (≥ 18 years of 
age) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a VELCADE-containing 
regimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior therapy, VELCADE was 
started at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or ≤ 1.0 mg/m2 (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 
and 11 every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent or in combination with 
dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in 
combination with VELCADE to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving 
dexamethasone during the course of VELCADE retreatment cycles.
The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. The 
overall best response rate (CR + PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4).
Clinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
Study LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
the combination of VELCADE, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone 
(VcR-CAP; n=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
(R-CHOP; n=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in the 
VcR-CAP treatment arm received VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days 12-21), 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2
IV on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 day VELCADE 
26
treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional treatment 
cycles were given.
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included, time to progression (TTP), time to next 
anti-lymphoma treatment (TNT), duration of treatment free interval (TFI), overall response rate (ORR) 
and complete response (CR/CRu) rate, overall survival (OS) and response duration.
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the two 
treatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% 
Asian, 69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for 
MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of ≥ 3, and 76% had Stage IV 
disease. Treatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up (median=40 months) were 
comparable in both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received by patients in both treatment 
arms with 14% of subjects in the VcR-CAP group and 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group 
receiving 2 additional cycles. The majority of the patients in both groups completed treatment, 80% in 
the VcR-CAP group and 82% in the R-CHOP group. Efficacy results are presented in Table 15:

Median PFS by investigator assessment was 30.7 months in the VcR-CAP group and 16.1 months in 
the R-CHOP group (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.51; p < 0.001). A statistically significant benefit (p < 0.001)
in favour of the VcR-CAP treatment group over the R-CHOP group was observed for TTP (median 
30.5 versus 16.1 months), TNT (median 44.5 versus 24.8 months) and TFI (median 40.6 versus 
20.5 months). The median duration of complete response was 42.1 months in the VcR-CAP group 
compared with 18 months in the R-CHOP group. The duration of overall response was 21.4 months 
longer in the VcR-CAP group (median 36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the R-CHOP group). The 
final analysis for OS was performed after a median follow-up of 82 months. Median OS was 90.7 
months for the VcR-CAP group compared with 55.7 months for the R-CHOP group (HR=0.66; 
p=0.001). The observed final median difference in the OS between the 2 treatment groups was 35 
months.
Patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis
An open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of 
VELCADE in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety concerns 
27
were observed during the study, and in particular VELCADE did not exacerbate target organ damage 
(heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate (including a 28.6% 
CR rate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 evaluable patients 
treated with the maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 twice-weekly. For these 
dose cohorts, the combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
VELCADE in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell 
lymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
A Phase II, single-arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s 
Oncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi-agent re-induction 
chemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective 
re-induction multi-agent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. VELCADE was 
administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered 
drugs in Block 3.
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 
18 months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free 
survival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis 
(n = 33) the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% 
(95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 
86) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported efficacy data are 
considered inconclusive (see section 4.2).
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 years 
(range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when VELCADE was added to the standard 
pediatric pre-B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions (Grade ≥ 3) were 
observed at a higher incidence in the VELCADE containing treatment regimen as compared with a 
historical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% versus 2%). No information on 
possible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were available in this study. Higher 
incidences were also noted for infections with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 
22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 
6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 
4% versus 0 in Block 2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with 
multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose 
maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent 
doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the 
1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.
Distribution
The mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- or 
repeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple 
myeloma. This suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib 
concentration range of 0.01 to 1.0 μg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human 
plasma. The fraction of bortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent.
28
Biotransformation
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes 
indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 enzymes, 3A4, 
2C19, and 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two deboronated metabolites 
that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. Deboronated-bortezomib metabolites 
are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors.
Elimination
The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours. 
Bortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. Mean 
total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent doses for 
doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively.
Special populations
Hepatic impairment
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I 
study during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying 
degrees of hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2.
When compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter 
dose-normalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were increased 
by approximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose
is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those patients should be
closely monitored (see section 4.2, Table 6).
Renal impairment
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who 
were classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups:
Normal (CrCL ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL=40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate 
(CrCL=20-39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of 
dialysis patients who were dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were 
administered intravenous doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of VELCADE twice weekly. Exposure of 
VELCADE (dose-normalised AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see section 4.2).
Age
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus 
administration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 pediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area (BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) 
clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the 
elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics 
such as age, body weight and sex did not have clinically significant effects on bortezomib 
clearance. BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed 
in adults.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Bortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the in vitro
chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations as low as 
3.125 μg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not genotoxic when 
tested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus assay in mice.
Developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally 
toxic doses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies were 
not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity 
studies. In the 6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have been 
29
observed. It is, therefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or female 
fertility. Peri- and postnatal development studies were not conducted.
In multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs 
included the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and 
lymphatic tissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and 
haematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice and 
dogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs have 
shown partial to full recovery following discontinuation of treatment.
Based on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to be 
limited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown.
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses 
approximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated with 
increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the decreased cardiac 
contractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive inotropic or pressor agents. 
Moreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed.

4.2
Posology and method of administration
VELCADE treatment must be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment 
of cancer patients, however VELCADE may be administered by a healthcare professional experienced 
in use of chemotherapeutic agents. VELCADE must be reconstituted by a healthcare professional (see 
section 6.6).
Posology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy)
Monotherapy
VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous
injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on 
days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. It 
32
is recommended that patients receive 2 cycles of VELCADE following a confirmation of a complete 
response. It is also recommended that responding patients who do not achieve a complete remission 
receive a total of 8 cycles of VELCADE therapy. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive 
doses of VELCADE.
Dose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy
VELCADE treatment must be withheld at the onset of any Grade 3 non-haematological or any 
Grade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4). 
Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, VELCADE treatment may be re-initiated at a 
25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2; 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the toxicity 
is not resolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of VELCADE must be considered 
unless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk.
Neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy
Patients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to be 
managed as presented in Table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy may 
be treated with VELCADE only after careful risk/benefit assessment.


If several VELCADE doses in a cycle are 
withheld (≥ 3 doses during twice weekly 
administration or ≥ 2 doses during weekly 
administration)
Grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicities 
VELCADE dose should be reduced by 1 dose 
level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 
1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2)
VELCADE therapy should be withheld until 
symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to 
Grade 1 or baseline. Then, VELCADE may be 
reinitiated with one dose level reduction (from 
1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 
0.7 mg/m2). For VELCADE-related neuropathic 
pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or 
modify VELCADE as outlined in Table 1.

days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. 
At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.
Dexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the VELCADE 
treatment cycle.
Four treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered.
Combination therapy with dexamethasone and thalidomide
VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous 
injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on 
days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 28-day treatment cycle. This 4-week period is considered a treatment cycle. 
At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.
Dexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the VELCADE 
treatment cycle.
Thalidomide is administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14 and if tolerated the dose is increased 
to 100 mg on days 15-28, and thereafter may be further increased to 200 mg daily from cycle 2 (see 
Table 4).
Four treatment cycles of this combination are administered. It is recommended that patients with at 
least partial response receive 2 additional cycles.

Dosage adjustments for transplant eligible patients
For VELCADE dosage adjustments, dose modification guidelines described for monotherapy should
be followed.
In addition, when VELCADE is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose reductions for these products should be considered in the event of toxicities 
according to the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
Posology for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
Combination therapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (VcR-CAP)
VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous 
injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on 
days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a 10-day rest period on days 12-21. This 3-week period is considered 
a treatment cycle. Six VELCADE cycles are recommended, although for patients with a response first 
documented at cycle 6, two additional VELCADE cycles may be given. At least 72 hours should 
elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.
The following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each VELCADE 3 week treatment 
cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and 
doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2.
Prednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each VELCADE treatment 
cycle.
Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma
Prior to initiating a new cycle of therapy:

Platelet counts should be ≥ 100,000 cells/μL and the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) should 
be ≥ 1,500 cells/μL
Platelet counts should be ≥ 75,000 cells/μL in patients with bone marrow infiltration or splenic 
sequestration
Haemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL
Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.



VELCADE treatment must be withheld at the onset of any ≥ Grade 3 VELCADE-related 
non-haematological toxicities (excluding neuropathy) or ≥ Grade 3 haematological toxicities (see also 
section 4.4). For dose adjustments, see Table 5 below.
Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to 
local standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be 
considered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration. Platelet transfusion for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia should be considered when clinically appropriate.
36

lymphoma
Toxicity
Haematological toxicity 
 ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting more than 7 days, a 
platelet count < 10,000 cells/μL
 If platelet counts < 25,000 cells/μL. or ANC 
< 750 cells/μL on a VELCADE dosing day 
(other than Day 1 of each cycle)
Grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicities 
considered to be related to VELCADE
Posology modification or delay
VELCADE therapy should be withheld for up to 
2 weeks until the patient has an ANC 
≥ 750 cells/μL and a platelet count 
≥ 25,000 cells/μL.
 If, after VELCADE has been held, the 
toxicity does not resolve, as defined above, 
then VELCADE must be discontinued.
 If toxicity resolves i.e. patient has an ANC 
≥ 750 cells/μL and a platelet count 
≥ 25,000 cells/μL, VELCADE may be 
reinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose 
level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 
1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2).
VELCADE therapy should be withheld
VELCADE therapy should be withheld until 
symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to 
Grade 2 or better. Then, VELCADE may be 
reinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level 
(from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 
0.7 mg/m2). For VELCADE-related neuropathic 
pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or 
modify VELCADE as outlined in Table 1.
In addition, when VELCADE is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the event 
of toxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics.
Special populations
Elderly
There is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age
with multiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma.
There are no studies on the use of VELCADE in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Therefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population.
In a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients 
exposed to VELCADE were in the range 65-74 years and ≥ 75 years of age, respectively. In patients 
aged ≥ 75 years, both regimens, VcR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see section 4.8).
Hepatic impairment
Patients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per the 
recommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on 
VELCADE at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a
subsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered 
based on patient tolerability (see Table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are not influenced in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (Creatinine Clearance [CrCL] > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2); therefore, dose adjustments are not 
necessary for these patients. It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced in 
patients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). Since 
dialysis may reduce bortezomib concentrations, VELCADE should be administered after the dialysis 
procedure (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in children below 18 years of age have not been established 
(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made.
Method of administration
VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or subcutaneous 
administration.
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous administration only.
VELCADE should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death.
Intravenous injection
VELCADE 3.5 mg reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection 
through a peripheral or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution for injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of 
VELCADE.
Subcutaneous injection
VELCADE 3.5 mg reconstituted solution is administered subcutaneously through the thighs (right or 
left) or abdomen (right or left). The solution should be injected subcutaneously, at a 45-90° angle. 
Injection sites should be rotated for successive injections.
If local injection site reactions occur following VELCADE subcutaneous injection, either a less 
concentrated VELCADE solution (VELCADE 3.5 mg to be reconstituted to 1 mg/ml instead of 
2.5 mg/ml) may be administered subcutaneously or a switch to intravenous injection is recommended.
When VELCADE is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration.
38
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease.
When VELCADE is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their Summaries of 
Product Characteristics for additional contraindications.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When VELCADE is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment with 
VELCADE. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention 
requirements is needed (see section 4.6).
Intrathecal administration
There have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of VELCADE. VELCADE 1 mg 
powder for solution for injection is for intravenous use only, while VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for 
solution for injection is for intravenous or subcutaneous use. VELCADE should not be administered 
intrathecally.
Gastrointestinal toxicity
Gastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common 
with VELCADE treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, patients who experience constipation should be closely monitored.
Haematological toxicity
VELCADE treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and anaemia). In studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with 
VELCADE and in patients with previously untreated MCL treated with VELCADE in combination 
with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP), one of the most 
common haematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. Platelets were lowest at Day 11 of 
each cycle of VELCADE treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. There was 
no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia. The mean platelet count nadir measured was 
approximately 40% of baseline in the single-agent multiple myeloma studies and 50% in the MCL 
study. In patients with advanced myeloma the severity of thrombocytopenia was related to 
pre-treatment platelet count: for baseline platelet counts < 75,000/l, 90% of 21 patients had a count 
≤ 25,000/l during the study, including 14% < 10,000/l; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count 
> 75,000/l, only 14% of 309 patients had a count ≤ 25,000/l during the study.
In patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of 
Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in the VELCADE treatment group (VcR-CAP) as compared to the 
non-VELCADE treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence of 
all-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the VcR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well as 
Grade 3 and higher bleeding events (VcR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In the 
VcR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients in the 
R-CHOP group.
Gastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with VELCADE 
treatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of VELCADE. 
VELCADE therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/l or, in the case of 
combination with melphalan and prednisone, when the platelet count is ≤ 30,000/l (see section 4.2). 
Potential benefit of the treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in case of 
moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding.
39
Complete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently 
monitored throughout treatment with VELCADE. Platelet transfusion should be considered when 
clinically appropriate (see section 4.2).
In patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with no 
evidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of VELCADE 
treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, colony
stimulating factor support was given to 78% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm and 61% of patients in 
the R-CHOP arm. Since patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, they should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte colony stimulating 
factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. 
Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered in case of repeated 
delays in cycle administration (see section 4.2).
Herpes zoster virus reactivation
Antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with VELCADE.
In the Phase III study in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence of 
herpes zoster reactivation was more common in patients treated with 
VELCADE+Melphalan+Prednisone compared with Melphalan+Prednisone (14% versus 4% 
respectively).
In patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the 
VcR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8).
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection
When rituximab is used in combination with VELCADE, HBV screening must always be performed 
in patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis B and 
patients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of 
active HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment with VELCADE. 
Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
rituximab for more information.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Very rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML 
and death, have been reported in patients treated with VELCADE. Patients diagnosed with PML had 
prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months 
of their first dose of VELCADE. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of the differential 
diagnosis of CNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be referred to a 
specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. Discontinue 
VELCADE if PML is diagnosed.
Peripheral neuropathy
Treatment with VELCADE is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is 
predominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory peripheral 
neuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early in the 
treatment and has been observed to peak during cycle 5.
It is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a burning 
sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness.
In the Phase III study comparing VELCADE administered intravenously versus subcutaneously, the 
incidence of Grade  2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% for the subcutaneous injection group 
and 41% for the intravenous injection group (p=0.0124). Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 
6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 16% in the intravenous treatment 
group (p=0.0264). The incidence of all grade peripheral neuropathy with VELCADE administered 
intravenously was lower in the historical studies with VELCADE administered intravenously than in 
study MMY-3021.
40
Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo neurological evaluation 
and may require a change in the dose, schedule or route of administration to subcutaneous (see 
section 4.2). Neuropathy has been managed with supportive care and other therapies.
Early and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological 
evaluation should be considered in patients receiving VELCADE in combination with medicinal 
products known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose reduction or 
treatment discontinuation should be considered.
In addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some 
adverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on 
autonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited.
Seizures
Seizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or epilepsy. 
Special care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures.
Hypotension
VELCADE treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse 
reactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who 
developed orthostatic hypotension on VELCADE (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of 
orthostatic hypotension prior to treatment with VELCADE. Most patients required treatment for their 
orthostatic hypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced syncopal 
events. Orthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of VELCADE. The 
mechanism of this event is unknown although a component may be due to autonomic neuropathy. 
Autonomic neuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may aggravate an underlying 
condition such as diabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised when treating patients with a 
history of syncope receiving medicinal products known to be associated with hypotension; or who are 
dehydrated due to recurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension 
may include adjustment of antihypertensive medicinal products, rehydration or administration of 
mineralocorticosteroids and/or sympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical 
advice if they experience symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving VELCADE. PRES is a rare, often reversible, 
rapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, 
lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, 
preferably Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients 
developing PRES, VELCADE should be discontinued.
Heart failure
Acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be a 
predisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or existing 
heart disease should be closely monitored.
Electrocardiogram investigations
There have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not been 
established.
Pulmonary disorders
There have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology such 
as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) in patients receiving VELCADE (see section 4.8). Some of these events have been fatal. A 
pre-treatment chest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential post-treatment 
pulmonary changes.
41
In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic 
evaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio should be 
considered prior to continuing VELCADE therapy.
In a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous 
infusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and VELCADE for relapsed acute myelogenous leukaemia 
died of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, this specific 
regimen with concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous 
infusion over 24 hours is not recommended.
Renal impairment
Renal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal impairment 
should be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Bortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with VELCADE at reduced 
doses and closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Hepatic reactions
Rare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving VELCADE and concomitant 
medicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic reactions 
include increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may be 
reversible upon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8).
Tumour lysis syndrome
Because bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells and MCL cells, 
the complications of tumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome 
are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and 
appropriate precautions taken.
Concomitant medicinal products
Patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent 
CYP3A4-inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when bortezomib is combined with CYP3A4- or 
CYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5).
Normal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving oral 
hypoglycemics (see section 4.5).
Potentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions
Potentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis 
with rash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib should be 
discontinued if serious reactions occur.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 
1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to the metabolism 
of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect the overall 
disposition of bortezomib.
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 
35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely 
monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
ritonavir).
42
In a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on 
the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients.
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction 
of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong 
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is 
not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced.
In the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 
inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients.
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of 
bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data 
from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant.
During clinical trials, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were uncommonly and commonly reported in 
diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving 
VELCADE treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of the 
dose of their antidiabetics.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Contraception in males and females
Male and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures during 
and for 3 months following treatment.
Pregnancy
No clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The 
teratogenic potential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated.
In non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and rabbits 
at the highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of bortezomib on 
parturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). VELCADE should not be 
used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with VELCADE.
If VELCADE is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this 
medicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus.
Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth 
defects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
unless all the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. Patients 
receiving VELCADE in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention 
programme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of thalidomide for 
additional information.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
VELCADE.
Fertility
Fertility studies were not conducted with VELCADE (see section 5.3).
43
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
VELCADE may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. VELCADE may 
be associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope uncommonly and
orthostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, patients must be cautious 
when driving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if they 
experience these symptoms (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Serious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with VELCADE include cardiac 
failure, tumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with VELCADE are nausea, 
diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, 
peripheral neuropathy (including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, rash, 
herpes zoster and myalgia.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
Multiple Myeloma
Undesirable effects in Table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or 
probable causal relationship to VELCADE. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data set 
of 5,476 patients of whom 3,996 were treated with VELCADE at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in Table 7.
Overall, VELCADE was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients.

Post-marketing adverse reaction regardless of indication
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
The safety profile of VELCADE in 240 MCL patients treated with VELCADE at 1.3 mg/m2 in 
combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP) versus 
242 patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
[R-CHOP] was relatively consistent to that observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main 
differences described below. Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of 
the combination therapy (VcR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia 
(1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse 
drug reactions are not attributable to VELCADE alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient 
population as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a ≥ 5% higher incidence of 
the haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, 
lymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hair 
disorders.
Adverse drug reactions identified as those with a ≥ 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the 
VcR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the 
VcR-CAP arm, are listed in Table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in the 
VcR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal 
relationship to VELCADE based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies.
Adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are 
defined as: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. Table 8 has been generated using Version 16 of the MedDRA.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Herpes zoster virus reactivation
Multiple Myeloma
Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 26% of the patients in the Vc+M+P arm. The incidence of 
herpes zoster among patients in the Vc+M+P treatment group was 17% for patients not administered 
antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis.
Mantle cell lymphoma
Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 137 of 240 patients (57%) in the VcR-CAP arm. The 
incidence of herpes zoster among patients in the VcR-CAP arm was 10.7% for patients not 
administered antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3.6% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis 
(see section 4.4).
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection
Mantle cell lymphoma
HBV infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients in the non-VELCADE 
treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP ) 
and 0.4% (n=1) of patients receiving VELCADE in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP). The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections was similar 
in patients treated with VcR-CAP or with R-CHOP (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively).
Peripheral neuropathy in combination regimens
Multiple Myeloma
In trials in which VELCADE was administered as induction treatment in combination with
dexamethasone (study IFM-2005-01), and dexamethasone-thalidomide (study MMY-3010), the 
incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the combination regimens is presented in the table below:

Peripheral neuropathy included the preferred terms: peripheral sensory neuropathy, neuropathy peripheral, peripheral 
motor neuropathy, and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy
Elderly MCL patients
42.9% and 10.4% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm were in the range 65-74 years and ≥ 75 years of 
age, respectively. Although in patients aged ≥ 75 years, both VcR-CAP and R-CHOP were less 
tolerated, the serious adverse event rate in the VcR-CAP groups was 68%, compared to 42% in the R-
CHOP group.
Notable differences in the safety profile of VELCADE administered subcutaneously versus
intravenously as single agent
In the Phase III study patients who received VELCADE subcutaneously compared to intravenous 
administration had 13% lower overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse reactions that were 
Grade 3 or higher in toxicity, and a 5% lower incidence of discontinuation of VELCADE. The overall 
incidence of diarrhoea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, asthenic conditions, upper respiratory 
tract infections and peripheral neuropathies were 12%-15% lower in the subcutaneous group than in 
the intravenous group. In addition, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathies was 
10% lower, and the discontinuation rate due to peripheral neuropathies 8% lower for the subcutaneous 
group as compared to the intravenous group.
Six percent of patients had an adverse local reaction to subcutaneous administration, mostly redness. 
Cases resolved in a median of 6 days, dose modification was required in two patients. Two (1%) of the 
patients had severe reactions; 1 case of pruritus and 1 case of redness.
The incidence of death on treatment was 5% in the subcutaneous treatment group and 7% in the 
intravenous treatment group. Incidence of death from “Progressive disease” was 18% in the 
subcutaneous group and 9% in the intravenous group.
Retreatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma
In a study in which VELCADE retreatment was administered in 130 patients with relapsed multiple 
myeloma, who previously had at least partial response on a VELCADE-containing regimen, the most 
common all-grade adverse events occurring in at least 25% of patients were thrombocytopenia (55%), 
neuropathy (40%), anaemia (37%), diarrhoea (35%), and constipation (28%). All grade peripheral 
neuropathy and grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 40% and 8.5% of patients, 
respectively.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
In patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute onset 
of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology studies, see section 5.3.
There is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient’s 
vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood pressure (such 
as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XG01.
Mechanism of action
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like 
activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex 
that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in 
regulating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of 
the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within 
the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death.
Bortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 M concentrations, bortezomib does not 
inhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more 
selective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome inhibition 
were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome with a t½ of 
20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible.
Bortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but 
not limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 
NF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, 
including cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, 
bortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.
Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and that 
cancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal cells. 
Bortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour models, including 
multiple myeloma.
Data from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast 
differentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in 
patients with multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with 
bortezomib.
Clinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma
A prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 
VISTA) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2 injected 
intravenously) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in 
improvement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone 
(60 mg/m2) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a 
maximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% were male, 88% 
were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80. Patients 
had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median hemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a 
median platelet count of 221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients had creatinine clearance 
≤ 30 ml/min (3% in each arm).
At the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, time to progression, was met and 
patients in the M+P arm were offered Vc+M+P treatment. Median follow-up was 16.3 months. The 
final survival update was performed with a median duration of follow-up of 60.1 months. A 
statistically significant survival benefit in favour of the Vc+M+P treatment group was observed 
(HR=0.695; p=0.00043) despite subsequent therapies including VELCADE-based regimens. Median 
survival for the Vc+M+P treatment group was 56.4 months compared to 43.1 for the M+P treatment 
group. Efficacy results are presented in Table 11:

Patients eligible for stem cell transplantation
Two randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase III trials (IFM-2005-01, MMY-3010) were conducted 
to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of VELCADE in dual and triple combinations with other 
chemotherapeutic agents, as induction therapy prior to stem cell transplantation in patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma.
In study IFM-2005-01 VELCADE combined with dexamethasone [VcDx, n=240] was compared to 
vincristine- doxorubicin-dexamethasone [VDDx, n=242]. Patients in the VcDx group received four 
21 day cycles, each consisting of VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly on 
days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in Cycles 1 
and 2, and on days 1 to 4 in Cycles 3 and 4).
Autologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in the 
VDDx and VcDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant 
procedure. Patient demographic and baseline disease charateristics were similar between the treatment 
groups. Median age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of patients had 
high-risk cytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx group and 
11 weeks for the VcDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups was 4 cycles.
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR). A statistically 
significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the VELCADE combined with 
dexamethasone group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included post-transplant response rates 
(CR+nCR, CR+nCR+VGPR+PR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Main efficacy 
results are presented in Table 12.

In study MMY-3010 induction treatment withVELCADE combined with thalidomide and 
dexamethasone [VcTDx, n=130] was compared to thalidomide-dexamethasone [TDx, n=127]. Patients 
54
in the VcTDx group received six 4-week cycles, each consisting of VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2
administered twice weekly days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a 17-day rest period from day 12 to 
day 28), dexamethasone (40 mg administered orally on days 1 to 4 and days 8 to 11), and thalidomide 
(administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14, increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and thereafter to 
200 mg daily).
One single autologous stem cell transplant was received by 105 (81%) patients and 78 (61%) patients 
in the VcTDx and TDx groups, respectively. Patient demographic and baseline disease charateristics 
were similar between the treatment groups. Patients in the VcTDx and TDx groups respectively had a 
median age of 57 versus 56 years, 99% versus 98% patients were Caucasians, and 58% versus 54% 
were males. In the VcTDx group 12% of patients were cytogenetically classified as high risk versus 
16% of patients in the TDx group. The median duration of treatment was 24.0 weeks and the median 
number of treatment cycles received was 6.0, and was consistent across treatment groups.
The primary efficacy endpoints of the study were post-induction and post-transplant response rates 
(CR+nCR). A statistically significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the VELCADE 
combined with dexamethasone and thalidomide group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 
Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Main efficacy results are presented in Table 13.

Clinical efficacy in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
The safety and efficacy of VELCADE (injected intravenously) were evaluated in 2 studies at the 
recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2: a Phase III randomised, comparative study (APEX), versus 
dexamethasone (Dex), of 669 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 
1-3 prior lines of therapy, and a Phase II single-arm study of 202 patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who had received at least 2 prior lines of treatment and who were progressing on 
their most recent treatment.
In the Phase III study, treatment with VELCADE led to a significantly longer time to progression, a 
significantly prolonged survival and a significantly higher response rate, compared to treatment with 
dexamethasone (see Table 14), in all patients as well as in patients who have received 1 prior line of 
therapy. As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at the 
recommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to dexamethasone were 
then offered VELCADE, regardless of disease status. Due to this early crossover, the median duration 
of follow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients who were refractory to their last 
prior therapy and those who were not refractory, overall survival was significantly longer and response 
rate was significantly higher on the VELCADE arm.
Of the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well as 
TTP remained significantly better for VELCADE independently of age. Regardless of 
2-microglobulin levels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (time to progression and overall survival, 
as well as response rate) were significantly improved on the VELCADE arm.

In the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent 
review committee and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow Transplant 
Group. The median survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ months). This 
survival was greater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by consultant clinical 
investigators for a similar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response rate was 
independent of myeloma type, performance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the number or 
type of previous therapies. Patients who had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had a response 
rate of 32% (10/32) and patients who received greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens had a response 
rate of 31% (21/67).

In the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with VELCADE 
alone were able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with VELCADE. The protocol 
allowed patients to receive dexamethasone if they had had a less than optimal response to VELCADE 
alone. A total of 74 evaluable patients were administered dexamethasone in combination with 
VELCADE. Eighteen percent of patients achieved, or had an improved response [MR (11%) or PR 
(7%)] with combination treatment.
Clinical efficacy with subcutaneous administration of VELCADE in patients with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma
An open label, randomised, Phase III non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of the 
subcutaneous administration of VELCADE versus the intravenous administration. This study included 
56
222 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
1.3 mg/m2 of VELCADE by either the subcutaneous or intravenous route for 8 cycles. Patients who 
did not obtain an optimal response (less than Complete Response [CR]) to therapy with VELCADE 
alone after 4 cycles were allowed to receive dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and after 
VELCADE administration. Patients with baseline Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts 
< 50,000/µl were excluded. A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response.
This study met its primary objective of non-inferiority for response rate (CR+PR) after 4 cycles of 
single agent VELCADE for both the subcutaneous and intravenous routes, 42% in both groups. In 
addition, secondary response-related and time to event related efficacy endpoints showed consistent 
results for subcutaneous and intravenous administration (Table 15).

VELCADE combination treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (study DOXIL-MMY-3001)
A Phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 646 patients 
comparing the safety and efficacy of VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus 
VELCADE monotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 prior therapy
and who did not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was TTP while the secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), using the European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.
A protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination for 
efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45% (95% CI; 29-57%, p < 0.0001) for 
patients treated with combination therapy of VELCADE and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The 
57
median TTP was 6.5 months for the VELCADE monotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for 
the VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. These results, 
though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis.
The final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant 
difference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; 
25.2-36.5 months) for the VELCADE monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 
28.9-37.1 months) for the VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy 
patients.
VELCADE combination treatment with dexamethasone
In the absence of any direct comparison between VELCADE and VELCADE in combination with 
dexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis was 
conducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of VELCADE in combination with 
dexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the VELCADE 
monotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL 
MMY-3001) in the same indication.
The matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. 
VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. 
VELCADE) are made comparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study 
subjects. This minimises the effects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects using 
non-randomised data.
One hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis demonstrated 
improved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS (hazard ratio 0.511; 
95% CI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; p=0.001) for 
VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone over VELCADE monotherapy.
Limited information on VELCADE retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available.
Phase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine 
the efficacy and safety of retreatment with VELCADE. One hundred and thirty patients (≥ 18 years of 
age) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a VELCADE-containing 
regimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior therapy, VELCADE was 
started at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or ≤ 1.0 mg/m2 (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 
and 11 every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent or in combination with 
dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in 
combination with VELCADE to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving 
dexamethasone during the course of VELCADE retreatment cycles.
The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. The 
overall best response rate (CR + PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4).
Clinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
Study LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
the combination of VELCADE, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone 
(VcR-CAP; n=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
(R-CHOP; n=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in the 
VcR-CAP treatment arm received VELCADE (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days 12-21), 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2
IV on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 day VELCADE 
treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional treatment 
cycles were given.
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included, time to progression (TTP), time to next 
anti-lymphoma treatment (TNT), duration of treatment free interval (TFI), overall response rate (ORR) 
and complete response (CR/CRu) rate, overall survival (OS) and response duration.
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the two 
treatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% 
Asian, 69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for 
58
MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of ≥ 3, and 76% had Stage IV 
disease. Treatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up (median=40 months) were 
comparable in both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received by patients in both treatment 
arms with 14% of subjects in the VcR-CAP group and 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group 
receiving 2 additional cycles. The majority of the patients in both groups completed treatment, 80% in 
the VcR-CAP group and 82% in the R-CHOP group. Efficacy results are presented in Table 16:

Median PFS by investigator assessment was 30.7 months in the VcR-CAP group and 16.1 months in 
the R-CHOP group (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.51; p < 0.001). A statistically significant benefit (p < 0.001) 
in favour of the VcR-CAP treatment group over the R-CHOP group was observed for TTP (median 
30.5 versus 16.1 months), TNT (median 44.5 versus 24.8 months) and TFI (median 40.6 versus 
20.5 months). The median duration of complete response was 42.1 months in the VcR-CAP group 
compared with 18 months in the R-CHOP group. The duration of overall response was 21.4 months 
longer in the VcR-CAP group (median 36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the R-CHOP group). The 
final analysis for OS was performed after a median follow-up of 82 months. Median OS was 90.7 
months for the VcR-CAP group compared with 55.7 months for the R-CHOP group (HR=0.66; 
p=0.001). The observed final median difference in the OS between the 2 treatment groups was 35 
months.
Patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis
An open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of 
VELCADE in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety concerns 
were observed during the study, and in particular VELCADE did not exacerbate target organ damage 
(heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate (including a 28.6% 
CR rate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 evaluable patients 
treated with the maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 twice-weekly. For these 
dose cohorts, the combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
VELCADE in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell 
lymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
59
A Phase II, single-arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s 
Oncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi-agent re-induction 
chemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective 
re-induction multi-agent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. VELCADE was 
administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered 
drugs in Block 3.
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 
18 months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free 
survival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis 
(n = 33) the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% 
(95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 
86) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported efficacy data are 
considered inconclusive (see section 4.2).
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 years 
(range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when VELCADE was added to the standard 
pediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions (Grade ≥ 3) were 
observed at a higher incidence in the VELCADE containing treatment regimen as compared with a 
historical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% versus 2%). No information on 
possible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were available in this study. Higher 
incidences were also noted for infections with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 
22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 
6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 
4% versus 0 in Block 2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with 
multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose 
maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent 
doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the 
1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.
Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m2 dose to patients with 
multiple myeloma (n=14 in the intravenous group, n=17 in the subcutaneous group), the total systemic 
exposure after repeat dose administration (AUClast) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous 
administrations. The Cmax after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/ml) was lower than intravenous
(223 ng/ml). The AUClast geometric mean ratio was 0.99 and 90% confidence intervals were 
80.18%-122.80%.
Distribution
The mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- or 
repeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple 
myeloma. This suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib 
concentration range of 0.01 to 1.0 μg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human 
plasma. The fraction of bortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent.
Biotransformation
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes 
indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 enzymes, 3A4, 
2C19, and 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two deboronated metabolites 
60
that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. Deboronated-bortezomib metabolites 
are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors.
Elimination
The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours. 
Bortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. Mean 
total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent doses for 
doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively.
Special populations
Hepatic impairment
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I 
study during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying 
degrees of hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2.
When compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter 
dose-normalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were increased 
by approximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose
is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those patients should be 
closely monitored (see section 4.2, Table 6).
Renal impairment
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who 
were classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups: 
Normal (CrCL ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL=40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate 
(CrCL=20-39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of 
dialysis patients who were dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were 
administered intravenous doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of VELCADE twice weekly. Exposure of 
VELCADE (dose-normalised AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see section 4.2).
Age
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus 
administration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 pediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area (BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) 
clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the 
elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics 
such as age, body weight and sex did not have clinically significant effects on bortezomib 
clearance. BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed 
in adults.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Bortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the in vitro
chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations as low as 
3.125 μg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not genotoxic when 
tested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus assay in mice.
Developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally 
toxic doses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies were 
not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity 
studies. In the 6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have been 
observed. It is, therefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or female 
fertility. Peri- and postnatal development studies were not conducted.
61
In multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs 
included the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and 
lymphatic tissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and 
haematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice and 
dogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs have 
shown partial to full recovery following discontinuation of treatment.
Based on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to be 
limited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown.
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses 
approximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated with 
increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the decreased cardiac 
contractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive inotropic or pressor agents. 
Moreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What VELCADE is and what it is used for
VELCADE contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called ‘proteasome inhibitor’. Proteasomes 
play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with their function, 
bortezomib can kill cancer cells.
VELCADE is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients 
older than 18 years:
-
alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, for 
patients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior treatment and 
for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is unsuitable.
in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease has 
not been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell 
transplantation.
in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with thalidomide, 
for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before receiving high-dose 
chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction treatment).
-
-
VELCADE is used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph 
nodes) in patients 18 years or older in combination with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and for whom 
blood stem cell transplantation is unsuitable.
2. What you need to know before you use VELCADE
Do not use VELCADE
-
if you are allergic to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)
if you have certain severe lung or heart problems.
-
Warnings and precautions
You should tell your doctor if you have any of the following:



low numbers of red or white blood cells
bleeding problems and/or low number of platelets in your blood
diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting
76








fainting, dizziness or light-headedness in the past
kidney problems
moderate to severe liver problems
numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet (neuropathy) in the past
heart or blood pressure problems
shortness of breath or cough
seizures
shingles (localised including around the eyes or spread across the body)
symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome such as muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, 
visual loss or disturbances and shortness of breath
memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty with walking or loss of vision. These may be signs of a 
serious brain infection and your doctor may suggest further testing and follow-up.
You will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with VELCADE, to check 
your blood cell counts regularly.
If you have mantle cell lymphoma and are given the medicine rituximab with VELCADE you should 
tell your doctor:

if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, patients 
who have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be fatal. If you 
have a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs of 
active hepatitis B.
You must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with 
VELCADE for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with VELCADE.
When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is 
needed (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section).
Children and adolescents
VELCADE should not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how the medicine 
will affect them.
Other medicines and VELCADE
Please tell your doctor, or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
In particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active 
substances:
-
ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections
ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection
rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections
carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat epilepsy
St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), used for depression or other conditions
oral antidiabetics
-
-
-
-
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not use VELCADE if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary.
Both men and women receiving VELCADE must use effective contraception during and for up to 
3 months after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor immediately.
You should not breast-feed while using VELCADE. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to restart 
breast-feeding after finishing your treatment.
Thalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When VELCADE is given in combination with 
thalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package 
leaflet for thalidomide).
77
Driving and using machines
VELCADE might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate tools 
or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you should still be cautious.
3.
How to use VELCADE
Your doctor will work out your dose of VELCADE according to your height and weight (body surface 
area). The usual starting dose of VELCADE is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week.
Your doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response to 
the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver 
problems).
Progressive multiple myeloma
When VELCADE is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of VELCADE intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 
and 11, followed by a 10-day ‘rest period’ without treatment. This 21-day period (3 weeks)
corresponds to one treatment cycle. You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
You may also be given VELCADE together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or
dexamethasone.
When VELCADE is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive 
VELCADE intravenously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 
is given on day 4 of the VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous infusion after the 
VELCADE injection.
You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
When VELCADE is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive VELCADE intravenously 
as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 
12, of the VELCADE, 21-day treatment cycle.
You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
Previously untreated multiple myeloma
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive VELCADE intravenously together with two other medicines; 
melphalan and prednisone.
In this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles 
(54 weeks).

Melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 
first week of each cycle.
In cycles 1 to 4, VELCADE is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32.
In cycles 5 to 9, VELCADE is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29.
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive VELCADE intravenously together with the medicines 
dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment.
When VELCADE is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive VELCADE intravenously 
as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 
11 of the VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle.
You will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks).
When VELCADE is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of a treatment 
cycle is 28 days (4 weeks).
Dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the VELCADE 28-day 
treatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if 
78
tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased to 
200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards.
You might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks).
Previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma
If you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive VELCADE 
intravenously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone.
VELCADE is given intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a ‘rest period’ without 
treatment. The duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). You might receive up to 8 cycles 
(24 weeks).
The following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle as 
intravenous infusions:
Rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2.
Prednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the VELCADE treatment cycle.
How VELCADE is given
This medicine is for intravenous use only. VELCADE will be administered by a health care 
professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines.
VELCADE powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare 
professional. The resulting solution is then injected into a vein rapidly, over 3 to 5 seconds.
If you are given too much VELCADE
As this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much.
In the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of 
these effects may be serious.
If you are given VELCADE for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, tell your doctor straight 
away if you notice any of the following symptoms:
-
-
-
muscle cramping, muscle weakness
confusion, visual loss or disturbances, blindness, seizures, headaches
shortness of breath, swelling of your feet or changes in your heart beat, high blood pressure, 
tiredness, fainting
coughing and breathing difficulties or tightness in the chest.
-
Treatment with VELCADE can very commonly cause a decrease in the numbers of red and white 
blood cells and platelets in your blood. Therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before and 
during your treatment with VELCADE, to check your blood cell counts regularly. You may 
experience a reduction in the number of:
-
platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious injury 
(e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or bleeding 
from the liver)
red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness
white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms.

RECONSTITUTION FOR INTRAVENOUS INJECTION
Note: VELCADE is a cytotoxic agent. Therefore, caution should be used during handling and 
preparation. Use of gloves and other protective clothing to prevent skin contact is recommended.
ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE MUST BE STRICTLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT HANDLING OF 
VELCADE SINCE NO PRESERVATIVE IS PRESENT.
1.1
Preparation of the 1 mg vial: carefully add 1.0 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride 
solution for injection to the vial containing the VELCADE powder by using a 1 ml syringe 
without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised powder is completed in less 
than 2 minutes.
The concentration of the resulting solution will be 1 mg/ml. The solution will be clear and 
colourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution.
1.2 Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. If 
any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution should be discarded. Confirm
concentration on vial to ensure that the correct dose is being given for the intravenous route of 
administration (1 mg/ml).
1.3
The reconstituted solution is preservative free and should be used immediately after preparation. 
However, the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 25°C 
stored in the original vial and/or a syringe. The total storage time for the reconstituted medicinal 
product should not exceed 8 hours prior to administration. If the reconstituted solution is not 
used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user.
It is not necessary to protect the reconstituted medicinal product from light.
2.
ADMINISTRATION




Once dissolved, withdraw the appropriate amount of the reconstituted solution according to 
calculated dose based upon the patient´s Body Surface Area.
Confirm the dose and concentration in the syringe prior to use (check that the syringe is marked 
as intravenous administration).
Inject the solution as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection through a peripheral or central 
intravenous catheter into a vein.
Flush the peripheral or intravenous catheter with sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride 
solution.
VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection IS FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. Do 
not give by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death.

How to store VELCADE
Contents of the pack and other information
1. What VELCADE is and what it is used for
VELCADE contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called ‘proteasome inhibitor’. Proteasomes 
play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with their function, 
bortezomib can kill cancer cells.
VELCADE is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients 
older than 18 years:
-
alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, for 
patients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior treatment and 
for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is unsuitable.
in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease has 
not been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell 
transplantation.
in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with thalidomide, 
for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before receiving high-dose 
chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction treatment).
-
-
VELCADE is used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph 
nodes) in patients 18 years or older in combination with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and for whom 
blood stem cell transplantation is unsuitable.
2. What you need to know before you use VELCADE
Do not use VELCADE
-
if you are allergic to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)
if you have certain severe lung or heart problems.
-
Warnings and precautions
You should tell your doctor if you have any of the following:



low numbers of red or white blood cells
bleeding problems and/or low number of platelets in your blood
diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting
88




seizures
shingles (localised including around the eyes or spread across the body)
symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome such as muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, 
visual loss or disturbances and shortness of breath
memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty with walking or loss of vision. These may be signs of a 
serious brain infection and your doctor may suggest further testing and follow-up.
You will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with VELCADE, to check 
your blood cell counts regularly.
If you have mantle cell lymphoma and are given the medicine rituximab with VELCADE you should 
tell your doctor:

if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, patients 
who have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be fatal. If you 
have a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs of 
active hepatitis B.
You must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with 
VELCADE for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with VELCADE.
When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is 
needed (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section).
Children and adolescents
VELCADE should not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how the medicine 
will affect them.
Other medicines and VELCADE
Please tell your doctor, or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
In particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active 
substances:
-
ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections
ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection
rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections
carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat epilepsy
St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), used for depression or other conditions
oral antidiabetics
-
-
-
-
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not use VELCADE if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary.
Both men and women receiving VELCADE must use effective contraception during and for up to 
3 months after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor immediately.
You should not breast-feed while using VELCADE. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to restart 
breast-feeding after finishing your treatment.
Thalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When VELCADE is given in combination with 
thalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package 
leaflet for thalidomide).
89
Driving and using machines
VELCADE might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate tools 
or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you should still be cautious.
3.
How to use VELCADE
Your doctor will work out your dose of VELCADE according to your height and weight (body surface 
area). The usual starting dose of VELCADE is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week.
Your doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response to 
the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver 
problems).
Progressive multiple myeloma
When VELCADE is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of VELCADE intravenously or 
subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day ‘rest period’ without treatment. This 
21-day period (3 weeks) corresponds to one treatment cycle. You might receive up to 8 cycles 
(24 weeks).
You may also be given VELCADE together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or 
dexamethasone.
When VELCADE is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive 
VELCADE intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous 
infusion after the VELCADE injection.
You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
When VELCADE is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive VELCADE intravenously 
or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 
4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, of the VELCADE, 21-day treatment cycle.
You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
Previously untreated multiple myeloma
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive VELCADE together with two other medicines; melphalan and 
prednisone.
In this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles 
(54 weeks).


Melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 
first week of each cycle.
In cycles 1 to 4, VELCADE is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32.
In cycles 5 to 9, VELCADE is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29.
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive VELCADE intravenously or subcutaneously together with the 
medicines dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment.
When VELCADE is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive VELCADE intravenously 
or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 
3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle.
You will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks).
When VELCADE is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of a treatment 
cycle is 28 days (4 weeks).
90
Dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the VELCADE 28-day 
treatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if 
tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased to 
200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards.
You might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks).
Previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma
If you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive VELCADE 
intravenously or subcutaneously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone.
VELCADE is given intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a ‘rest 
period’ without treatment. The duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). You might receive 
up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
The following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle as 
intravenous infusions:
Rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2.
Prednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the VELCADE treatment cycle.
How VELCADE is given
This medicine is for intravenous or subcutaneous use. VELCADE will be administered by a health 
care professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines.
VELCADE powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare 
professional. The resulting solution is then either injected into a vein or under the skin. Injection into a 
vein is rapid, taking 3 to 5 seconds. Injection under the skin is in either the thighs or the abdomen.
If you are given too much VELCADE
As this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. 
In the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of 
these effects may be serious.
If you are given VELCADE for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, tell your doctor straight 
away if you notice any of the following symptoms:
-
-
-
muscle cramping, muscle weakness
confusion, visual loss or disturbances, blindness, seizures, headaches
shortness of breath, swelling of your feet or changes in your heart beat, high blood pressure, 
tiredness, fainting
coughing and breathing difficulties or tightness in the chest.
-
Treatment with VELCADE can very commonly cause a decrease in the numbers of red and white 
blood cells and platelets in your blood. Therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before and 
during your treatment with VELCADE, to check your blood cell counts regularly. You may 
experience a reduction in the number of:
-
platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious injury 
(e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or bleeding 
from the liver)
red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness
white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms.
-

Note: VELCADE is a cytotoxic agent. Therefore, caution should be used during handling and 
preparation. Use of gloves and other protective clothing to prevent skin contact is recommended.
ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE MUST BE STRICTLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT HANDLING OF 
VELCADE SINCE NO PRESERVATIVE IS PRESENT.
1.1
Preparation of the 3.5 mg vial: carefully add 3.5 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium 
chloride solution for injection to the vial containing the VELCADE powder by using a syringe 
of the appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised powder 
is completed in less than 2 minutes.
The concentration of the resulting solution will be 1 mg/ml. The solution will be clear and 
colourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution.
1.2 Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. If 
any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution should be discarded. Be sure 
that the correct dose is being given for the intravenous route of administration (1 mg/ml).
1.3
The reconstituted solution is preservative free and should be used immediately after preparation. 
However, the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 25°C 
stored in the original vial and/or a syringe. The total storage time for the reconstituted medicinal 
product should not exceed 8 hours prior to administration. If the reconstituted solution is not

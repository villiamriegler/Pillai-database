2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Epithelial  ovarian  carcinoma  and  its  histological  and  clinical  equivalents,  primary  peritoneal  carcinoma 
(PPC)  and  primary  peritoneal  carcinoma  (FTC),  continue  to  be  a  highly  lethal  primary  gynecologic 
malignancy  and  is  a  leading  cause  of  gynecologic  cancer-related  mortality  among  women  globally. 
Worldwide, ovarian cancer affects 225,500 women annually and results in 140,200 cancer-related deaths 
around the world, with an annual incidence of 65,584 (42,749 deaths) in Europe1.  
As the disease tends to be asymptomatic in the early stages, the majority of women are diagnosed with 
disseminated advanced-stage disease. Standard of care at initial diagnosis includes cytoreductive surgery 
(CRS) followed by platinum and taxane systemic chemotherapy. Despite optimal upfront surgery and the 
administration of front line chemotherapy approximately 70% of patients will relapse in the first 3 years2.

diagnosis, treatment and follow-up,  Ann Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6): vi24-vi32

Recurrent  disease  is  classified  as  either  platinum-resistant  or  platinum-sensitive,  depending  on  whether 
the disease recurs < 6 or ≥6 months, respectively, following last cycle of previous platinum therapy; this 
classification  is  highly  prognostic  and  is  important  in  determining  treatment  options.  An  increased 
duration  of  this  platinum-free  interval  (PFI)  to  ≥6  months  corresponds  to  the  likelihood  of  achieving 
another  response  with  a  platinum-based  regimen  as  well  as  improvements  in  progression-free  survival 
(PFS)  and  overall  survival  (OS).  As  such,  treatment  for  recurrent  ovarian  cancer  is  directed  by  the 
patient’s previously demonstrated sensitivity to their platinum-based chemotherapy. 
For  recurrent  platinum-sensitive  disease,  carboplatin  in  combination  with  either  paclitaxel,  gemcitabine, 
or  pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin  (PLD)  are  the  most  commonly  used  chemotherapy  regimens2,3. 
Bevacizumab is used in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine for treatment of adult patients with 
first  recurrence  of  platinum-sensitive  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who 
have  not  received  prior  therapy  with  bevacizumab  or  other  VEGF  inhibitors  or  VEGF  receptor–targeted 
agents4. 
About the product 
Bevacizumab  (Avastin)  is  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  that  inhibits  angiogenesis  by 
neutralizing all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by blocking their binding 
to  VEGF  receptors.  Bevacizumab  received  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  approval  in  the  European  Union 
(EU)  on  12  January  2005  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  mCRC  in  combination  with 
intravenous 5-FU/folinic acid or intravenous 5-FU/folinic acid/irinotecan. Since the initial MA, bevacizumab 
has  been  approved  for  use  in  a  variety  of  indications,  including  locally  recurrent  or  metastatic  breast 
cancer  (mBC),  advanced,  metastatic,  or  recurrent  non-small  cell lung  cancer (NSCLC),  advanced  and/or 
metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (mRCC),  newly  diagnosed  glioblastoma  multiforme  (GBM)  and  GBM  after 
relapse or disease progression, persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, front-line treatment of 
epithelial ovarian (EOC), primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), or fallopian tube (FTC). 
Avastin has been authorised on 31 July 2014 for the treatment of platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant 
recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine.  
The  MAH  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  for  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and 
paclitaxel in adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or 
primary  peritoneal  cancer  based  on  the  results  from  Study  GOG-0213  (Gynecologic  Oncology  Group 
[GOG] Study-0213), a phase III randomized controlled clinical trial of carboplatin and paclitaxel alone or 
in  combination  with  bevacizumab  followed  by  bevacizumab,  and  secondary  cytoreductive  surgery  in 
platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer. 
The applied indication was as follows: 
Bevacizumab,  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine  or  in  combination  with  carboplatin 
and  paclitaxel,  is  indicated  for  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  first  recurrence  of  platinum-sensitive 
epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  have  not  received  prior  therapy 
with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
The recommended indication is as follows: 
Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with 
bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
Avastin is administered in combination with either carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 cycles and up to 10

cycles or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 cycles and up to 8 cycles, followed by 
continued use of Avastin as single agent until disease progression. The recommended dose of Avastin is 
15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin of isotype IgG1, which will to a high degree be 
metabolised  by  normal  proteolytic  pathways  and  excreted  as  non-recognisable  and  non-functional 
fragments.  As  a  protein  bevacizumab  is  exempted  from  the  necessity  of  ERA  studies.  Nonetheless,  a 
ready  biodegradability  test  (OECD  301F),  an  algal  growth  test  (OECD  201)  and  an  acute  daphnia 
immobilisation (OECD 202) inhibition study have been conducted. The studies indicate that bevacizumab 
is readily biodegradable, and without potential for unexpectedly high ecotoxicity. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An adequate justification for not providing a full ERA has been provided. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
 Considering the above data, bevacizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Efficacy and safety data to support this application are derived from Phase III Study GOG-0213 in adult 
women with platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC, PPC, or FTC. 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Study GOG-0213 
Methods 
Study  GOG-0213  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  open-label  Phase  III  study  comprised  of  two  parts, 
Objective 1 and Objective 2. Objective 1 evaluated whether the addition of bevacizumab to the second-
line and maintenance phases of treatment improves the duration of OS relative to second-line paclitaxel 
(Pac)  and  carboplatin  (Crb)  alone  in  patients  with  recurrent,  platinum-sensitive,  ovarian  cancer  (OC). 
Objective  2  is  evaluating  whether  the  addition  of  surgical  secondary  cytoreduction  to  adjuvant 
chemotherapy improves the duration of OS in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, OC. 
The  CSR  submitted  only  reports  the  data  collected  on  or  before  5  November  2014  for  Objective  1.  The 
study is ongoing to address Objective 2 regarding secondary cytoreduction and is outside the scope of the 
CSR. 
An overview of the study design (objective 1) is presented below.

procedure  during  the  course  of  the  study;  patients  with  placement  of  vascular  access  device  or 
core biopsy within 7 days prior to the first date of treatment on this study. 
•  Patients  who  underwent  pre-treatment  secondary  cytoreduction  were  to  undergo  therapy  with 
bevacizumab on cycle #2. 
•  Patients  who  underwent  pre-treatment  surgery  for  purposes  other  than  cytoreduction  could  also 
participate provided they met the eligibility criteria in the Protocol.  
Treatments 
Bevacizumab 
The dose of bevacizumab was 15 mg/kg administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.  
Carboplatin 
The dose of carboplatin (AUC5) was calculated to reach a target area under the curve (AUC) according to 
the Calvert formula using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the Cockcroft-Gault formula. 
Carboplatin  was  administered  as  a  60-minute  infusion.  When  administered  in  conjunction  with  other 
medications,  carboplatin  was  to  be  infused  after  the  other  agents.  Carboplatin,  either  alone  or  in 
combination was to be premedicated with dexamethasone (either IV or PO),  anti-histamine H1 (such as 
diphenhydramine) and anti-histamine H2 (such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine). 
Carboplatin  doses  were  based  on  the  patient’s  weight  at  baseline  and  were  to  remain  the  same 
throughout the study. However, the doses were to be recalculated if the patient had a weight change of 
greater than or equal to 10% from baseline. 
Paclitaxel 
The initial dose of paclitaxel was 175 mg/m2 given on Day 1 of each 21 day-cycle. Patients whose body 
weight changed by 10% or more were to undergo recalculation of the dose based on the adjusted body 
surface area. 
Docetaxel 
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour could be substituted for paclitaxel.  
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
•  To  determine  whether  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  the  second-line  and  maintenance  phases  of 
treatment increases the duration of OS relative to second-line carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in patients 
with  platinum-sensitive,  recurrent  epithelial  ovarian  cancer,  primary  peritoneal  or  fallopian  tube  cancer 
(Objective 1). 
Secondary objectives 
•  To  determine  if  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  the  second-line  and  maintenance  phase  of  treatment 
increases  the  duration  of  PFS  relative  to  second-line  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  alone  in  patients  with 
platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/815114/2017 
Page 11/73 
 
  
  
• To prospectively determine the incidence of carboplatin and paclitaxel hypersensitivity in these patients 
undergoing retreatment with both agents as first recurrence therapy. 
•  To  determine  if  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  the  second-line  and  maintenance  phases  of  treatment 
increases  quality  of  life  (QOL)  relative  to  second-line  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  alone  in  patients  with 
platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  OS defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. 
• 
•  Secondary endpoint:  
o  PFS  defined  as  the  time  between  the  date  of  randomization  and  the  date  of  first 
documented  disease  progression  or  death,  whichever  occurred  first.  Tumor  assessments 
and  response  evaluations  were  determined  by  the  investigators  using  GOG  Response 
Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  criteria  (a  modification  of  standard  RECIST 
criteria  per  Therasse.  2000).  Measurable  disease  was  defined  as  at  least  one  lesion  that 
could  be  accurately  measured  in  at  least  one  dimension  (longest  dimension  to  be 
recorded). Each lesion was to be ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, 
including palpation, plain X-ray, CT, and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT.

Sample size 
The  targeted  accrual  for  Objective  1  of  the  study  was  660  patients.  It  was  anticipated  that  240  eligible 
patients per year could be enrolled from GOG treatment centers. Therefore, the expected time to accrue 
the  targeted  sample  size  was  2.75  years.  An  additional  1.5  year  post-accrual  follow-up  period  was 
anticipated. 
Randomisation 
Patients meeting eligibility requirements were to be considered first for the surgical randomization aspect 
of the trial.  
Chemotherapy was to be administered following recovery up to 6 weeks after surgery. Patients who were 
surgical candidates and consented to be randomized to the surgical objective underwent randomization to 
the surgical objective followed by randomization to the bevacizumab objective: Crb+Pac or Crb+Pac+Bev. 
Patients who were not surgical candidates or who declined randomization to the surgical objective, were 
randomized only to the bevacizumab objective: Crb+Pac or Crb+Pac+Bev. 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  secondary  surgical  debulking  status  (randomized  to  undergo 
cytoreduction  or  randomized  to  not  undergo  secondary  cytoreduction  vs.  not  a  candidate  or  did  not 
consent to secondary surgical cytoreduction) and time from completing first-line platinum chemotherapy 
to  registration  onto  this  study  (6  −  12  months  vs.  >  12  months).  The  registration  form,  i.e. 
randomization  schema  defined  the  stratification  factor  as  “treatment-free  interval”  that  does  not 
consistently  represent  the  platinum-free  interval  due  to  the  inconsistent  use  of  maintenance  therapy  in 
the front-line setting.

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Objective  1  of  this  study  was  to  determine  whether  bevacizumab  reduced  the  overall  death  rate  when 
compared to the standard treatment (CT).  
The null hypotheses: H0: HR = λCTB / λCT = 1 was assessed, where λ is the death rate for the indicated 
treatment.  The  treatment  regimens  (Crb+Pac  alone  and  Crb+Pac+Bev)  were  compared  with  a  log-rank 
procedure  which  included  all  of  the  patients  categorized  by  their  randomly  assigned  treatment.  This 
comparison  only  included  patients  enrolled  prior  to  29  August  2011  and  hence  selected  their  systemic 
treatment. The type I error for this comparison was limited to 2.5% (one-tail) accounting for the planned 
interim analyses. This is equivalent to a 5% (two-tailed) test as described in the Roche SAP. 
The  log-rank  test  was  stratified  (using  stratification  factors  as  recorded  on  the  CRF)  by  the  secondary 
surgical debulking status (randomized to undergo cytoreduction or randomized to not undergo secondary 
cytoreduction  vs.  not  a  candidate  or  did  not  consent  to  secondary  surgical  cytoreduction)  and  the 
duration of platinum-free interval prior to enrolling onto this study (6 - 12 months vs. > 12 months). 
If  the  bevacizumab-containing  regimen  reduced  the  overall  death  rate  of  the  control  regimen  by  25%, 
then  this  was  considered  clinically  significant.  Assuming  proportional  hazards,  this  effect  size  was 
comparable to increasing the expected proportion surviving for at least 22 months (median from previous 
studies) by 9.5% (50.0% vs. 59.5%). In order to provide an 81% chance of detecting this effect size, the 
study was considered sufficiently mature to permit a final analysis of the systemic regimens when there 
were  at  least  214  deaths  (214/330  =  0.65)  reported  among  those  patients  assigned  to  the  standard 
regimen  (CT).  If  the  alternative  hypothesis  was  true,  then  the  expected  total  number  of  deaths  at  the 
time of the final analyses would be 394. The critical values for rejecting the null hypothesis were adjusted 
for one interim analysis at 50% information to control the Type I error, using the O’Brien and Fleming like 
type I error spending function proposed by Lan and DeMets 
An  interim  analysis  of  efficacy  and  futility  with  a  data  cutoff  of  30  August  2012  was  conducted  as  pre-
specified  in  the  protocol  when  at  least  110  deaths  were  reported  among  all  those  patients  randomly 
allocated  prior  to  29  August  2011  to  the  Crb+Pac  alone  regimen  (approximately  50%  of  the  full 
information  for  Objective  1).  A  total  number  of  209  deaths  among  all  patients  randomized  prior  to  29 
August  2011  had  occurred  at  this  interim  analysis  (114  in  the  Crb+Pac  alone  arm,  95  in  the 
Crb+Pac+Bev arm). 
The study was not stopped at the interim analysis (no information was released) and Genentech / Roche 
was made aware of the results after the final analysis, corresponding to the full information required for 
the  final  overall  survival  (OS)  analysis  pre-specified  in  the  GOG-0213  protocol.  At  the  time  of  the  GOG 
data cutoff on 5 November 2014, there were 415 deaths reported among all patients randomly allocated 
prior to 29 August 2011.  
The efficacy analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were 
randomized to study treatment. 
The  primary  safety  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one  full  or 
partial dose of any component of the study treatment (bevacizumab or chemotherapy). 
The comparison of OS between the two treatment arms was based on a two-sided stratified log-rank test 
at the overall 0.05 level of significance. Adjusting for the alpha spent during the first interim analysis, the 
two-sided alpha boundary for the final analysis was recalculated to be 0.0489 (adjusted two sided alpha

level).  Median  OS  for  both  treatment  arms  was  estimated  using  Kaplan-Meier  methodology  and  95% 
confidence  intervals  for  median  OS  were  computed  on  the  basis  of  standard  errors  from  Greenwoods 
formula.  Kaplan-Meier  curves  were  constructed  for  the  two  treatment  arms.  For  patients  who  have  not 
died  by  the  time  of  analysis,  data  was  censored  as  of  the  last  contact  date  at  which  the  patient  was 
known to be alive. Data for patients who were lost to follow-up were analyzed as censored observations 
on  the  date of  last  contact.  Estimate of  the  treatment  effect  was  expressed  as  a  hazard  ratio  (HR,  with 
two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]) using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model fitted with the 
treatment  (carboplatin  plus  paclitaxel  with  bevacizumab  compared  to  carboplatin  plus  paclitaxel  alone) 
and  adjusted  for  the  stratification  factors  at  randomization  (the  same  as  used  in  the  stratified  log-rank 
test). 
A  stratified  log-rank  test  (using  the  same  stratification  factors  as  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis)  was 
used  to  compare  the  duration  of  PFS  between  treatment  arms.  The  Kaplan-Meier  method  was  used  to 
estimate  median  PFS  for  both  treatment  arms,  and  the  95%  CI  for  median  PFS  was  computed  using 
Greenwoods formula. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to provide a visual depiction of the difference 
between the treatment arms. Data from patients who have not experienced disease progression or death 
was  censored  at  the  last  tumour  assessment  date.  Data  for  patients  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  were 
analyzed as censored observations on the date of the last tumour assessment or if no post-randomization 
tumour  assessment  was  available,  at  the  date  of  randomization.  Data  for  patients  who  received  non-
protocol  specified  anti-cancer  therapy  (NPT)  prior  to  their  PFS  event  were  censored  at  the  last  disease 
assessment  prior to  receiving  NPT.  Data  for  patients  without  an event  were  censored  at  the date  of the 
last  disease  assessment  prior  to  receiving  NPT.  The  HR  was  estimated  using  the  stratified  Cox 
proportional hazards regression model.  
Descriptive summary statistics of the baseline HRQoL data were calculated, including descriptions of the 
distribution  of  HRQoL  scores  (mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  etc.).  A  repeated  mixed-effect  model 
(including patients as random effects) was used to assess the difference in mean FACT-O-TOI scores over 
time  and  between  treatment  arms.  This  model  had  a  term  for  time  that  was  treated  as  a  categorical 
variable, a term for treatment group, and a term for treatment-by-time interaction. Baseline scores were 
included as covariates in the model. Statistically significant differences were interpreted with reference to 
published estimates of clinically meaningful differences 
ORR was defined as percentage of patients with a complete or partial overall response determined by two 
consecutive investigator assessments ≥  4 weeks apart, was compared between the two treatment arms 
using  the  Mantel-Haenszel  χ 2  test,  stratified  by the  same  factors  used  in  the  primary  efficacy  analysis. 
For both treatment arms, an estimate of the ORR and its 95% CI was determined; an exact 95% CI was 
constructed  using  the  Clopper-Pearson  method.  CIs  for  the  difference  in  ORRs  between  the  two  arms 
were determined using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 33 patients were reported to have major protocol deviations, and these occurred with a similar 
frequency in the Crb+Pac alone arm (16 patients: 4.8%) and Crb+Pac+Bev arm (17 patients: 5.0%). A 
total  of  11  patients  (3.3%)  in  the  Crb+Pac  alone  arm  and  8  patients  (2.4%)  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm 
were deemed to have deviations based on pathology committee review. These included 11 patients due 
to inadequate pathology, 5 patients due to wrong cell type and 3 patients due to wrong primary. 
Table 3: Summary of protocol deviations by trial treatment (overall ITT population) 
Changes to study conduct 
The original version of the protocol dated 6 December 2007 was amended 5 times for patients enrolled in 
the first part of the study prior to 29 August 2011 (for Objective 1). 
Changes to the Statistical Analysis 
The  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP),  although  written  retrospectively  by  Roche,  was  based  on  the  pre-
specified GOG-0213 SAP as defined in the GOG-0213 protocol.  All analyses pertaining to the primary and 
secondary  endpoints  were  performed  on  the  basis  of  the  outline  in  the  protocol.  Additional  sensitivity 
analyses were performed to confirm the robustness of the primary and secondary analyses. 
The  results  presented in  the  CSR  are  based on  the data  that  was  transferred from  GOG  to  Genentech  / 
Roche  on  10  December  2015,  cleaned  per  Genentech  /  Roche  standards  and  analyzed  using  methods 
considered appropriate for detailed scientific review. The major differences between the GOG and Roche 
analyses of the study included:

–  For  the  stratified  efficacy  analysis,  instead  of  using  treatment-free-interval  data  based  on  the 
randomization  system  as  one  of  the  stratification  factors  as  used  by  the  GOG,  Roche  used  the 
platinum-free-interval  data  based  on  the  eCRF.  Clinically,  PFI  is  deemed  to  be  the  more  robust 
prognostic  factor  than  TFI.  Furthermore,  it  can  be  more  accurately  assessed  using  eCRF  inputs 
since  it  would  take  into  consideration  modifications  in  front-line  treatment  such  as  maintenance 
therapy with a taxane, bevacizumab, or another agent. The stratified OS analysis based on GOG’s 
approach was also performed and is reported in this CSR as a sensitivity analysis. 
– A two-sided test with 5% alpha which is equivalent to a 1-sided test with 2.5% alpha was used. 
– ORR was added as an exploratory analysis in Roche's analysis plan although it was not part of 
the original protocol specified endpoints. 
– Adverse event reporting from Roche was through MedDRA coding. 
The  table  below  shows  the  concordance  between  platinum-free  interval  reported  on  the  eCRF  and  the 
treatment  free  interval  reported  on  the  registration  form  (randomisation  schema)  for  all  randomised 
patients  in  the  study.  45  patients  (6.7%)  had  a  discrepancy  in  the  stratification  factors  (TFI  vs.  PFI)  at 
randomisation between the eCRF and registration form.

There were 5 patients with 6 ≤  PFI ≤  12 months and TFI > 12 months. For one patient the date of 
recurrence was 9 days short of 12 months. The date of the recurrence was clarified and confirmed with 
the GOG after querying the site. For the other 4 patients, the TFI interval appears to have been 
incorrectly entered on the registration form.

Sensitivity analyses for OS 
a) Time to censoring 
The Kaplan-Meier curves of time to censoring remained close over the course of the study. 
b) Multiple cox regression model for overall survival 
A  summary  of  a  multiple  Cox  regression  model  adjusted  for  treatment  and  baseline  prognostic  factors 
that  might  be  associated  with  OS  is  shown  below.  No  covariate  selection  process  was  applied;  all 
covariates  were  included  in  the  model,  regardless  of  statistical  significance.  An  estimated  HR  in  one 
subgroup  level  is  defined  by  the  covariate  (e.g.,  White  for  covariate  race)  relative  to those  in  the  other 
subgroup level (e.g., non-White) resulting from the model containing all covariates. The adjusted hazard 
ratio for treatment group was 0.80 (95% CI [0.66, 0.98], p-value = 0.0312).

c) Overall Survival Stratified Using Stratification Factors as Recorded During Randomisation (Based on 
Registration Form, TFI) 
In  the  stratified  analysis  using  the  stratification  factors  based  on  the  registration  form  (during 
randomisation),  the  HR  for  OS  was  0.838  (95%  CI  [0.693;  1.014])  and  the  log-rank  test  p-value  was

d) Overall survival unstratified analysis 
In the unstratified analysis, the HR for OS was 0.840 (95% CI [0.695; 1.015]) and the log-rank test p-
value was 0.0698.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No formal dose-response studies were submitted in support of this indication. The chosen dose is similar 
to other indications. The recommended dose of bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg bw given once every 21 days 
(q3w) as an intravenous infusion, is acceptable. The clinical studies performed in 7.5 and 10 mg/kg bw, 
are not convincing enough to change the 15 mg/kg bw dose, which is the currently approved dose in the 
front-line and recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer settings. 
The Applicant initially submitted the results of one single pivotal trial to support the proposed indication. 
The treatment of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal 
cancer (hereafter referred to as “ovarian cancer”) is based on platinum-doublet therapy. The commonly 
used agents are carboplatin and paclitaxel. Thus, the chemotherapy backbone is acceptable. Data from 
patients who underwent surgery were pooled with those who did not have surgery in the two treatment 
groups. Since these patients were randomised into the two treatment arms, it should be fairly balanced, 
and thus any possible impact of surgery status would be similar in the two groups. 
The Applicant applied acceptable inclusion/exclusion criteria that clearly define patients with histological 
diagnosed recurrent EOC, PPC or FTC after complete response to front-line platinum-taxane therapy, and 
treatment-free interval of at least 6 months. Patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab were also 
enrolled in the study and this subgroup will provide valuable information with regard to continued 
bevacizumab treatment in the proposed patient population. Patients were excluded if they had conditions 
that may have been exacerbated upon treatment with bevacizumab. 
Patients were randomised to crb+pac or crb+pac+bev. The used doses/schedules of bevacizumab, 
carboplatin, paclitaxel and docetaxel are in alignment with current clinical practice. 
The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to the crb+pac 
chemo-backbone increase median OS. The Applicant has defined one primary endpoint, OS, and several 
secondary  endpoints,  incl.  PFS.  The  primary  endpoint,  OS,  is  fully  acceptable  and  secondary  endpoints 
will  provide  further  valuable  evidence/data  with  regard  to  the  use  of  bevacizumab  in  this  patient 
population.  Tumour  assessments  and  response  evaluations  were  determined  by  the  investigators.  The 
GOG RECIST criteria have been used in this study which may differ from other studies with bevacizumab. 
Disease progression could be defined by CA-125 criteria alone. It is reflected in the SmPC 5.1, that GOG 
RECIST  criteria  have  been  used.  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  has  post-hoc  added  ORR  as  an  exploratory 
endpoint. This endpoint was not part of original protocol from GOG, and consequently the value of these 
data is very limited.

Patients were randomized based on secondary surgical debulking and treatment-free period, which both 
are important prognostic factors. The MAH has applied slightly different criteria how to interpret/define 
treatment-free –interval compared to the GOG. However, analysis of OS by the GOG criteria were 
included as sensitivity analysis. Fourty five (45) patients (6.7%) had a discrepancy in the stratification 
factors (TFI vs. PFI) at randomisation between the eCRF and registration form. The 40 patients with 6 ≤ 
TFI ≤ 12 months and PFI > 12 months could, according to the MAH, possibly be explained by the 
inconsistent use of maintenance therapy in the front-line setting obscuring the actual date of last 
platinum treatment.  
The study is open-label thus there is a theoretical chance that secondary endpoints such as PFS, HRQoL 
and safety may have been biased due to the study design. 
In terms of statistical methods, the MAH has correctly adjusted for multiplicity due to the interim 
analysis. The sample size calculation seems reasonable. The decision to stratify by platinum-free interval 
and not by the originally planned treatment-free interval was made retrospectively after the study results 
were published and well known to personnel involved in the reporting of the study. In the primary 
analysis of OS the stratification factors defined in the original randomisation schema would have been 
preferred (p=0.0683, a non-significant difference). 
A higher percentage of patients had withdrawn from trial treatment in the Crb+ Pac + Bev arm (88.7%) 
than  in  the  Crb  +  Pac  alone  arm  (32.7%).  However,  this  difference  is  largely  attributed  to  the  longer 
observation  period  in  the  Crb  +  Pac  +  Bev  arm  due  to  the  continued  treatment  with  Bev  alone  in  that 
arm. The number of patients that did not receive treatment, patients that withdrew from treatment due 
to “patient withdrawal” and patients lost to follow-up were quite similar between arms. 
There were comparable numbers of major protocol deviations in the two arms, and these were mostly 
related to pathology committee review. The MAH has provided an overview of the protocol deviations, 
which were minor and are deemed not to have had any major influence on the trial results. 
The baseline demographic characteristics were well-balanced with no major differences. Mean age is 
approximately 60 years, ranging from 23 to 85. The majority of patients are below 65 years, white, ECOG 
0 or 1. Very few patients were ECOG 3. These characteristics are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The majority of patients were diagnosed with serous adenocarcinoma, FIGO stage III, poorly 
differentiated histology, with ovary as the primary site and with CA-125 being abnormal. The baseline 
disease characteristics were well-balanced; however, there were slightly more patients with FIGO stage 
III in the bev+chemo arm. If any, this slight imbalance is in favour of the control arm, however, this is 
considered unlikely. 
In  total  69  patients  had  received prior  anti-VEGF/bevacizumab.  The  Applicant  clarified that  all  of the  69 
patients  had  received  bevacizumab  as  part  of  frontline  therapy.  Furthermore,  only  36  patients  (ca.  5-6 
%) had received frontline bevacizumab maintenance therapy, thus, only a limited number of patient are 
treated with prior bev/anti-VEGF or maintenance bevacizumab. 
The applicant discussed results from three supportive studies in the platinum-sensitive recurrent OC 
setting as response to CHMP request to further justify the indication in patients previously treated with 
bevacizumab (data not shown). Among the 29 patients in the single arm phase 2 trial of irinotecan in 
combination with bevacizumab in recurrent OC (Musa et al. 2016), 12 patients (41.3%) had received 
prior bevacizumab and the clinical benefit rate was similar to that in the ITT population of the study [67% 
(95% CI: 35%, 90%) vs. 72.4% (95% CI: 52.8%, 87.3%)]. The AURELIA study included 26 patients 
(7%) who were previously treated with anti-angiogenic therapy and then were treated with bevacizumab. 
Sample size was deemed to be inadequate to draw any conclusions. Results from a single institutional 
pilot study examining the efficacy and safety of adding oral cyclophosphamide to sequential bevacizumab 
therapy in recurrent OC (Matulonis et al. 2012) were also provided. Thirteen (13) patients (of the total 20 
Assessment report  
EMA/815114/2017 
Page 38/73 
 
  
  
enrolled) who progressed with single bevacizumab were continued on bevacizumab with added oral 
cyclophosphamide, resulting in 4 patients with confirmed clinical benefit. The authors concluded that 
adding oral cyclophosphamide to bevacizumab after tumour progression on single-agent bevacizumab 
appears to be safe and tolerable. Overall, the three supportive studies mentioned are very small, single 
arm studies and therefore it is not possible to draw any conclusions from these. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal study met its primary endpoint. The HR is 0.823 (0.680, 0.996), p-value = 0.0447. Median 
OS improved 5.3 months from 37.3 to 42.6 months, adding almost an additional half year of survival is 
considered of clinical relevance. In the stratified analysis using the stratification factors based on the 
registration form during randomisation the HR for OS was 0.838 (95% CI [0.693; 1.014]) and the log-
rank test p-value was 0.0683. This was the planned analysis in the clinical study protocol by GOG, and 
did not reach statistical significance. However, both the HR and median survival times were similar to the 
OS analysis based on the on the eCRF. These data have been reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.1). 
The results of the subgroup analyses for OS in the ITT population were generally consistent with the 
results of the protocol-specified primary analysis of OS with the majority of subgroups having the point 
estimate of the HR below 1 and were consistent with the overall treatment effect. Note, however, that the 
study was not powered to detect differences in the individual subgroups, and that many of the subgroups 
included small numbers of patients as seen by the wide 95% CIs. 
With  regard  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  prior  exposure  to  bevacizumab/ant-VEGF,  it  is  important  to 
emphasize  that  only  69  patients  are  included  in  this  subgroup.  There  is  no  clear  benefit  of  treating 
patients  with  prior  exposure  to  bevacizumab  in  first-line,  with  bevacizumab  at  first  platinum-sensitive 
relapse.  Even  though  additional  supportive  studies  have  been  presented,  there  is  no  strong  scientific 
rationale to support removing the limitation from the current label. 
Additionally,  the  proposed  removal  of  the  limitation  to  previous  bevacizumab  use  will  not  only  apply  to 
paclitaxel and carboplatin, but also to carboplatin and gemcitabine. However, no data were presented in 
the  dossier  to  substantiate  a  removal  of  the  limitation  for  previous  bevacizumab  use  for  the  already 
approved  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine  combination.    Therefore,  the  provided  data  are  not  supportive  of 
the  indication  of  bevacizumab  and  chemotherapy  using  the  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine  combination  in 
patients who received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted 
agents. 
The PFS result support the primary endpoint, median PFS improved from 10.2 to 13.8 months, and these 
findings are also overall in line the PFS results in study AVF4095g, where the PFS by INV was 8.4 vs. 12.4 
in the crb+gem and crb+gem+bev arm respectively. It is acknowledged that the chemotherapy backbone 
is different between studies AVF4095g and GOG-0213, but it is nonetheless encouraging to observe that 
the PFS results in the bevacizumab arms are similar. PFS was primary endpoint in study AVF4095g that 
led  to  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  use  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and 
gemcitabine in patients with platinum-sensitive disease.  
The performance of bevacizumab in different subgroups in terms of PFS is overall in line with the ITT 
result. However, some of the subgroups are very small leading to great uncertainty. No firm conclusions 
can be drawn from these subgroups.

There is no indication of any detrimental effect on QoL by adding bevacizumab to crb-pac, but having in 
mind that the study is open-label, the value of these data are questioned. The Applicant also defined and 
performed  post-hoc  analysis  of  ORR,  and  as  such  it  has  limited  value.  However,  the  results  seem  to 
support the OS and PFS results. 
Hence, the presented data from Study GOG-0213 show non-significant changes in OS and PFS for this 
small subgroup of patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab. In addition, the three supportive studies 
mentioned are very small, single arm studies and therefore it is not possible to draw any conclusions from 
these. A summary of data on bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, breast 
cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme was provided, however, these data are not considered possible to 
extrapolate into the platinum-sensitive recurrent OC setting.  
No explanation was provided regarding a possible resistance mechanism to bevacizumab in non-naïve 
patients and its potential impact on the efficacy of re-treatment with bevacizumab in the relevant setting. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the pivotal study met its primary endpoint and clinically relevant results are observed with 
regard to OS and PFS in the ITT population. Additional data from three supportive studies were also 
presented. However, no sufficient clinical data or strong scientific rationale were provided for the 
continuous treatment of patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  study,  the  primary  comparison  of  safety  was  based  on  the  safety 
population  over  the  entire  study  (i.e.,  Crb+Pac+Bev  followed  by  bevacizumab  alone  compared  with 
Crb+Pac  alone  without  any  further  treatment).  This  provides  a  conservative  assessment  of  the  safety 
profile of bevacizumab as well as of the bevacizumab based regimen investigated in this trial. No analysis 
by  treatment  phase  was  undertaken  given  the  known  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  treatment.  An 
overview of safety in patients previously treated with bevacizumab is also provided. 
Patient exposure 
The safety population in the study comprised those patients who received at least one full or partial dose 
of  any  component  of  trial  treatment,  with  patients  assigned  according  to  the  treatment  they  actually 
received. Of the 336 patients randomized to Crb+Pac alone, 327 received the randomized treatment (i.e., 
Crb+Pac).  Of  the  337  patients  randomized  to  Crb+Pac+Bev,  325  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
Bev  and  5  patients  only  received  Crb+Pac.  As  a  result,  these  5  patients  were  included  in  the  Crb+Pac 
alone arm for the safety analysis. Thus, the safety analysis population included 332 patients (98.8%) in 
the  Crb+Pac  alone  arm  and  325  patients  (96.4%)  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm.  The  safety  population  who 
were previously treated with bevacizumab included 35 patients (10.4%) in the Crb+Pac alone arm and 33 
patients (9.8%) in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. 
The  overall  median  duration  of  exposure  in  the  overall  safety  population  was  18.6  (range  0.1  –  65.1) 
weeks in the Crb+Pac alone arm and 48.9 (range 0.1 – 333.9) weeks in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. 
The  median  duration  of  exposure  of  bevacizumab  was  48.9  (range  0.1  –  333.9)  weeks  in  the 
Crb+Pac+Bev  arm,  and  the  median  duration  of  carboplatin  (Crb+Pac:  18.1  weeks;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  18.7

weeks)  and  paclitaxel/docetaxel  (Crb+Pac:  18.3  weeks;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  19.3  weeks)  was  comparable 
between the Crb+Pac alone arm and the Crb+Pac+Bev arm.

Duration of safety follow-up 
The median duration of safety follow-up for the overall safety population was 22.9 (range 4.4 – 69.4) 
weeks in the Crb+Pac, and 53.1 (range 4.4 – 338.1) weeks in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. The median 
duration of safety follow-up for the prior bevacizumab safety population was 23.3 (range 7.4 – 44.9) 
weeks in the Crb+Pac alone arm, and 44.7 (range 10.4 – 142.3) weeks in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
In the overall safety population, one or more AESIs of any grade were reported in a higher proportion of 
patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (73%) compared to the Crb+Pac alone arm (23%). This difference was 
mainly due to an increase of specific AESIs in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm compared to the Crb+Pac alone arm. 
These  were  bleeding  events  (42%  patients  vs.  11%  patients,  respectively),  hypertension  (42%  patients 
vs.  3%  patients,  respectively),  proteinuria  (17%  patients  vs.  <1%  patients,  respectively)  and 
neutropenia and associated complications (Crb+Pac; 8%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 12%).

Deaths/other significant events 
A total of 219 (66.0%) deaths were reported in patients receiving Crb+Pac and 207 (63.7%) deaths were 
reported  in  patients  receiving  Crb+Pac+Bev.  The  most  frequently  reported  cause  of  death  in  both 
treatment arms was ‘’due to this disease’’ (i.e., ovarian cancer), which accounted for 62.0% of deaths in 
the Crb+Pac arm and 58.8% of deaths in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. In addition, 5 patients (1.5%) in each 
treatment arm died “due to this disease (i.e., ovarian cancer)/due to other cause”, and 2 patients (0.6%) 
in each treatment arm died ‘’due to this disease/due to protocol treatment’’. One patient (0.3%) in each 
treatment arm died ‘’due to protocol treatment”. 
Table 36 
Summary  of  deaths  by  primary  cause  of  death  by  trial  treatment  (overall  Safety 
Population) 
A review of all patients with causes of death recorded as “Due to other cause”, “Due to this disease/Due 
to  other  cause”  and  “Unknown”  was  provided.  The  analysis  revealed  that  some  deaths  reported  under 
these  categories  were  due  to  concomitant  diseases.  There  were  7  patients  who  died  due  to  unknown 
cause, and most events occurred during the follow-up period of the trial and in the absence of exposure 
to any study drug. Although the causes were unknown, they occurred for the most part during the follow 
up period without exposure to any study drug.

Laboratory findings 
Normal ranges were not available in this study. Therefore, Grade 0 and 1 could not be derived and were 
left as missing in the table below. As a result, this table can only be used to interpret CTCAE v3 Grades 2, 
3  and  4.  Percentages  are  based  on  total  number  of  patients  with  laboratory  values  that  fall  within 
CTCAEv3 Grade 2, 3 or 4, and not on the overall safety population. 
Clinically meaningful laboratory test value abnormalities as assessed by the investigator were reported as 
AEs.  During  the  study,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  a  worst  value  of  Grade  2  for  haemoglobin 
(Crb+Pac:  98%;  Crb+Pac+Bev  92%),  WBC  (Crb+Pac:  91%;  Crb+Pac+Bev  95%)  and  granulocytes 
(Crb+Pac:  96%;  Crb+Pac+Bev  95%)  was  similar  in  both  treatment  arms.  Too  few  patients  had  their 
platelets measured for a meaningful interpretation of the data to be made. 
All  incidences  of  Grade  3  haemoglobin  and  WBC,  and  Grade  3  and  4  granulocytes  in  both  arms  during 
treatment  occurred in  patients  who  had  missing  baseline  values.  Thus,  it  was  not  possible  to  determine 
whether these grades were newly occurring or were already present at baseline.  No chemistry laboratory 
values were available in this trial.

Adverse events that led to dose modification 
In study GOG-0213, dose modifications (increase or decrease in dose) for bevacizumab due to AEs were 
not allowed, and bevacizumab could be either held or discontinued according to the hematologic and non-
hematologic toxicity. For Crb and Pac, the dose could be modified (held, reduced or discontinued) based 
on hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. AEs leading to a reduction in the dose of Crb and Pac were 
not collected consistently in study GOG-0213. 
Safety in prior bevacizumab population 
The safety profile in patients who were retreated with bevacizumab in this trial was consistent with safety 
observed  in  the  overall  safety  population  The  key  safety  data  reported  in  the  population  of  69  patients 
previously treated with bevacizumab indicated the following: 
•  The proportion of patients with at least one AE (all grades) was similar in the two treatment arms 
(Crb+Pac: 97.1%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 100.0%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/815114/2017 
Page 59/73 
 
  
  
 
•  The  proportion  of  patients  with  a  SAE  was  higher  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm  (27.3%)  than  in  the 
Crb+Pac  alone  arm  (8.6%).  The  majority  of  SAEs  occurred  in  single  patients  only  in  either 
treatment arm. 
•  The proportion of patients with Grade ≥ 3 AEs was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (51.5%) than 
in the Crb+Pac alone arm (37.1%). The most frequently reported Grade ≥ 3 AEs were abdominal 
pain  (Crb+Pac:  0%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  12%),  nausea  (Crb+Pac:  3%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  9%),  small 
intestine  obstruction  (Crb+Pac:  3%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  6%),  febrile  neutropenia  (Crb+Pac:  0%; 
Crb+Pac+Bev:  9%),  hypertension  (Crb+Pac:  0%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  6%),  proteinuria  (Crb+Pac: 
0%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 6%) and dyspnoea (Crb+Pac: 0%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 6%). 
•  Grade  5  AEs  were  reported  with  a  low  and  equivalent  frequency  in  both  treatment  arms 
(Crb+Pac: 1 patient [2.9%]; Crb+Pac+Bev: 0 patients [0%]). 
•  More  patients  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm  (18.2%)  than  in  the  Crb+Pac  alone  arm  (2.9%)  were 
withdrawn from any study drug due to an AE. The majority of AEs (by preferred term) leading to 
study treatment discontinuation occurred in < 1% of patients in either treatment arm. 
•  AESIs were reported more frequently in patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (63.6% patients) than 
in the Crb+Pac alone arm (11.4% patients). More patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (21.2%) than 
in the Crb+Pac alone arm (5.7%) had a Grade ≥ 3 AESI or a serious AESI (Crb+Pac+Bev: 9.1%; 
Crb+Pac: 2.9%). 
•  The  most  common  AESIs  were  non-CNS  bleeding  (Crb+Pac;  5.7%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  45.5%), 
hypertension  (Crb+Pac;  0%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  27.3%),  proteinuria  (Crb+Pac;  0%;  Crb+Pac+Bev: 
15.2%) and neutropenia and associated complications (Crb+Pac; 5.7%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 12.1%).

Post marketing experience 
Globally,  bevacizumab  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (mCRC),  locally 
recurrent  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  (mBC),  advanced,  metastatic,  or  recurrent  non-small  cell  lung 
cancer  (NSCLC),  advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (mRCC),  newly  diagnosed  glioblastoma 
multiforme  (GBM)  and  GBM  after  relapse  or  disease  progression,  front-line  treatment  of  EOC,  FTC,  or 
PPC,  treatment  of  platinum-sensitive  and  platinum-resistant  recurrent  EOC,  FTC,  or  PPC,  and  cervical 
cancer. 
Since  initial  market  approval  in  the  United  States  on  26  February  2004  (i.e.,  international  birth  date 
[IBD])  and  until  the  end  of  the  February  2016,  bevacizumab  has  been  approved  for  use  in  over  100 
countries  worldwide.  The  estimated  cumulative  clinical  trial  exposure  to  bevacizumab  from  the 
development  international  birth  date  (DIBD,  3  March  1997)  to  February  2016  is  32,237  patients.  Since 
the  IBD,  an  estimated  total  of  2,394,526  patients  have  received  bevacizumab  in  the  postmarketing 
setting. 
The  number  of  AE  and  SAEs  experienced  by  patients  by  SOC  since  the  IBD  in  all  indications  and  in 
ovarian  cancer  was  presented.  The  higher  proportion  of  AEs  and  SAEs  in  patients  with  ovarian  cancer 
compared  to  the  proportion  of  AEs  and  SAEs  in  the  overall  population  (i.e.,  all  indications)  within  the 
Gastrointestinal  SOC  and  Reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders  SOC  is  confounded  by  the  ovarian 
patient  population.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  in  ovarian  cancer  was  consistent  with  the 
known safety profile.

No relevant new additional safety signals have been identified based on postmarketing data from patients 
treated  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  The  Sponsor  will  continue  to  actively 
monitor safety as part of the ongoing pharmacovigilance program. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab across multiple 
indications. Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is also indicated for the front-line 
treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian cancer.  
The median duration of exposure of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel is comparable between the two 
treatment arms. The median number of bevacizumab cycles is 16. The total dose of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel/docetaxel is also comparable between the two arms.  Overall, this enables a reasonable 
assessment of safety in this patient population. The duration of safety follow-up is also considered 
acceptable. 
The overall number of AEs was comparable between the two arms, however, there were more SAEs, 
Grade 3/4 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the crb+pac+bev arm. There were considerably more 
cases of non-CNS bleedings, hypertension, proteinuria and thromboembolic events. However, the events 
are expected and observed in clinical trials with bevacizumab. They are clinically manageable and are 
reflected in the SmPC, where precautionary measures are also provided.   
Hypomagnesaemia is often associated with chemotherapy and may in theory be augmented by diarrhoea 
or by increased excretion from the kidney, however, diarrhoea occurred only slightly more frequently in 
the crb+pac+bev arm. Proteinuria, as a sign of affected kidney function, was much more frequently 
observed in the crb+pac+bev arm. There were significantly more patients in the chemo + bev arm who 
developed hypomagnesaemia (16.9% vs 27.4%) and the applicant conducted a detailed review of all 
patients who experienced a hypomagnesaemia event. Although hypomagnesaemia was possibly 
associated with proteinuria, no firm conclusions could be drawn. The nature, severity, and incidence of 
hypomagnesaemia in bevacizumab-exposed patients was consistent with the known safety profile of 
bevacizumab and no clinically significant consequences from hypomagnesaemia were observed in the 
trial. Hypomagnesemia has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. No other change in risk 
minimization activities was proposed and this is considered acceptable. 
In terms of AESIs, bleeding, hypertension, neutropenia, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, wound 
healing complications and GI perforations occurred more frequently in the bevacizumab arm. These 
events are AESI and are as such expected to occur more frequently in the bevacizumab arm. This is 
expected based on previous experience with bevacizumab in different indications over the past decade.  
These events are clinically manageable and adequately reflected in the SmPC, where precautionary 
measures are also provided.  Most of the bleeding events were epistaxis. There were no cerebrovascular 
bleeding events in the bevacizumab arm.  
The number of patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm with a GI fistula did not exceed what has earlier been 
reported for this patient group and is reflected in the SmPC (2%). In the present trial four patients 
(1.2%) in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm experienced a Grade ≥3 GI perforation event (colonic fistula, intestinal 
perforation, small intestine perforation, and large intestine perforation). All-grade GI perforations were 
reported in 6 patients (2%) in the crb+pac+bev arm, of which 4 patients (1%) experienced a Grade ≥ 3 
GI perforation event comprising colonic fistula , intestinal perforation, small intestine perforation, and 
large intestine perforation. Given the frequency of GI perforation events observed in GOG-0213 and the 
assessment of the cases, it is agreed that the current SmPC covers the risk of GI perforation sufficiently 
and that no changes in the SmPC based on GOG-0213 are warranted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/815114/2017 
Page 63/73 
 
  
  
Grade ≥ 3 AESIs were reported in the overall safety population more frequently in patients in the 
Crb+Pac+Bev arm (30% patients) than in the Crb+Pac alone arm (8% patients). This difference was 
mainly due to an increase in the incidence in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm compared to the Crb+Pac alone arm 
of hypertension (11% patients vs. <1% patients, respectively) and proteinuria (8% patients vs. 0% 
patients, respectively). 
Overall, SAEs was more frequently observed in the bevacizumab arm, mostly related to GI, neutropenia 
and infections. The applicant provided an overview of Grade 4 SAE which showed that eight patients 
(2.4%) experienced a total of 11 Grade 4 SAEs in the Crb+Pac arm and 28 patients (8.6%) experienced a 
total of 31 Grade 4 SAEs in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. These Grade 4 SAEs were equally distributed between 
the System Organ Classes (SOCs) in both arms. Unfortunately, the duration of Grade 4 SAEs could not be 
determined for most of the events as the investigators did not collect these data.  
In  terms  of  laboratory  findings,  there  were  no  major  differences,  however,  with  regard  to  platelets,  too 
few patients had their platelets measured, and thus no conclusions can be drawn. 
The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal of study treatment was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev compared 
to the chemotherapy only arm (25.2% versus 11.1%, respectively); this was mainly due to proteinuria.  
Eighty-seven  of  325  patients  (27%)  discontinued  bevacizumab  during  the  initial  chemotherapy 
combination  treatment  phase  with  a  median  of  4  cycles  of  treatment.  Additionally,  227  patients  (70%) 
stopped bevacizumab during the maintenance phase with a median of 20 cycles. 
There were no relevant imbalances in deaths related to treatment between the two study arms. 
Overall,  based  on  the  difference  of  at  least  10%  in  all-grade  AEs  or  2%  difference  in  Grade  ≥  3  AEs 
between  the  bevacizumab  arm  and  the  control  arm,  the  following  additional  ADRs  were  identified  and 
included  in  the  SmPC  (see  section  4.8):  all  grade  cough,  all  grade  hypomagnesemia,  all  grade 
hyponatremia  and  Grade  3-  5  hyponatremia.  Furthermore  the  frequency  of  myalgia  and  epistaxis  has 
been modified from common to very common based on the data from the pivotal study. The frequency of 
Grade  3-5  wound  healing  complications  was  also  updated  to  1.8%  based  on  the  data  from  study  GOG-
213. In addition, two corrections based on previous data from studies OCEANS and AURELIA were made 
to section 4.8 regarding the frequency Grade 3 proteinuria (10.9%) and reporting rate of Gastrointestinal 
perforations in patients with ovarian cancer (2%) and were considered acceptable. 
With  regards  to  safety  in  special  population,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  more  non-CNS 
bleedings and neutropenia in patients < 65 years of age in the bevacizumab arm, comprising 2/3 of the 
population.  A  review  confirmed  a  high  incidence  of  both  epistaxis  and  neutropenia  including  febrile 
neutropenia  in  patients  <  65  years.  As  epistaxis  is  a  known  identified  risk  associated  with  exposure  to 
bevacizumab and is included in the “undesirable effects” section of the SmPC, no additional changes are 
proposed.  Neutropenia  is  already  considered  an  important  identified  risk  associated  with  exposure  to 
bevacizumab  and  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  activities  for  neutropenia  are  included  in  the 
bevacizumab Risk Management Plan (RMP). Therefore, no additional changes are proposed. 
The  majority  of  patients  were  below  65,  white,  ECOG  0  or  1.  Very  few  patients  were  ECOG  3.  These 
characteristics are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  Grade  5  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment,  and  AESIs  was 
consistent  with  prior  observations  in  patients  aged  >  65  years-old  being  treated  with  bevacizumab. 
However, the relatively small sample sizes preclude any very strong conclusions. 
Generally, the safety profile of the Crb+Pac+Bev combination was similar in patients who were previously 
treated  with  bevacizumab  in  first  line  (N=68)  compared  with  patients  who  were  bevacizumab-naïve. 
Again,  the  number  of  SAE/AESIs  and  treatment  discontinuations  was  higher  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm 
compared with the Crb+Pac arm. The number of deaths was balanced.

Compared  with  safety  data  from  the  previously  assessed  Studies  BO17707/ICON7  and  GOG-0218  that 
studied  the  combination  bevacizumab  +  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel  in  patients  with  platinum-sensitive 
ovarian  cancer  in  the  first  line  setting  the  absolute  incidence  of  hypertension  and  proteinuria  in  the 
bevacizumab-exposed patients in Study GOG-0213 was higher (42% vs. 26% vs. 32% for hypertension; 
17% vs. 4% vs. 9% for proteinuria). Still, there were differences in the design, dose, and population of 
these  studies  hampering  any  direct  comparisons.  Further,  these  higher  incidences  of  hypertension  and 
proteinuria were consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab. 
Generally,  the  safety  profile  of  the  bevacizumab  +  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel  combination  was  similar  in 
patients  who  were  previously  treated  with  bevacizumab  in  first  line  compared  with  patients  who  were 
bevacizumab  naïve.  However,  the  number  of  patients  in  this  subgroup  is  limited  (Crb+Pac+Bev  n=33, 
Crb+Pac n=35). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of bevacizumab is well-known and as expected. The overall number of AEs is comparable 
between the two arms, however, there are more SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in 
the crb+pac+bev arm. AESI for bevacizumab are not unexpected in the active arm. The following 
additional ADRs were identified based on the submitted data and included in the SmPC (see section 4.8): 
all grade cough, all grade hypomagnesemia, all grade hyponatremia and Grade 3- 5 hyponatremia.  
In conclusion, there are no new major safety concerns. Although more toxicity was observed with the 
addition of bevacizumab, it is considered to be clinically manageable and adequately addressed by 
current risk minimisation activities.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
• 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 27.0 could be acceptable if the MAH

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma and its histological and clinical equivalents, primary peritoneal carcinoma 
(PPC) and primary peritoneal carcinoma (FTC), continue to be a highly lethal primary gynecologic 
malignancy and is a leading cause of gynecologic cancer-related mortality among women globally. 
Worldwide, ovarian cancer affects 225,500 women annually and results in 140,200 cancer-related deaths 
around the world, with an annual incidence of 65,584 (42,749 deaths) in Europe1. As the disease tends to 
be asymptomatic in the early stages, the majority of women are diagnosed with disseminated advanced-
stage disease.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard of care at initial diagnosis includes cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by platinum and 
taxane systemic chemotherapy. Despite optimal upfront surgery and the administration of front line 
chemotherapy approximately 70% of patients will relapse in the first 3 years2. 
Recurrent disease is classified as either platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive, depending on whether 
the disease recurs < 6 or ≥ 6 months, respectively, following last cycle of previous platinum therapy; this 
classification is highly prognostic and is important in determining treatment options. For recurrent 
platinum-sensitive disease, carboplatin in combination with either paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) are the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens2.  
Avastin is used, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine for treatment of adult patients with first 
recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have 
not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy and safety data supporting this application are derived from a multicenter, randomized, open-
label pivotal Phase III Study GOG-0213 in adult women with platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC, PPC, or 
FTC evaluating whether the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phases of 
treatment improves the duration of OS relative to second-line paclitaxel (Pac) and carboplatin (Crb) alone 
in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, ovarian cancer (Objective 1). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint. The HR was 0.823 (0.680, 0.996), p-value = 0.0447. Median OS 
improved 5.3 months from 37.3 to 42.6 months, adding almost an additional half year of survival, which 
is considered of clinical relevance.  
The PFS results are clearly in support of the primary endpoint. Median PFS improved from 10.2 to 13.8 
months. The results are statistically significant and clinically relevant. The PFS findings are also overall in 
line with the PFS results in study AVF4095g, where the PFS by INV was 8.4 vs. 12.4 in the crb+gem and 
crb+gem+bev arm respectively. It is acknowledged that the chemotherapy backbone is different between 
studies AVF4095g and GOG-0213, but it is nonetheless encouraging to observe that the PFS results in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/815114/2017 
Page 69/73 
 
  
  
bevacizumab arms are similar. PFS was primary endpoint in study AVF4095g that led to the extension of 
the indication to use bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine in patients with 
platinum-sensitive disease. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For the stratified efficacy analysis, instead of using treatment-free-interval data based on the 
randomization system as one of the stratification factors as used by the GOG, the MAH used the platinum 
-free-interval data based on the eCRF. The stratified OS analysis based on GOG’s approach was 
performed as a sensitivity analysis. In this analysis using the stratification factors based on the 
registration form (during randomisation), the HR for OS was 0.838 (95% CI [0.693; 1.014]) and the log-
rank test p-value was 0.0683. In the unstratified analysis, the HR for OS was 0.840 (95% CI [0.695; 
1.015]) and the log-rank test p-value was 0.0698. The originally planned primary analysis of OS (GOG 
analysis) using the stratification factors based on the registration form (during randomization) would 
have been preferred in the primary analysis and has been reflected in the SmPC. 
With regard to patients with prior bevacizumab exposure, it is important to emphasize that only 69 
patients were included in this subgroup. There is also no clear benefit of treating patients with prior 
exposure to bevacizumab in first-line, with bevacizumab at first platinum-sensitive relapse. Even after 
additional presentation of data from three supportive studies, there was no strong scientific rationale to 
remove the limitation from the current SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of bevacizumab is well-known as a consequence of many years of use in the clinical setting. 
Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is also indicated for the front-line treatment 
of adult patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The median duration of exposure of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel/docetaxel was comparable between the two treatment arms. The median number of 
bevacizumab cycles was 16. The total dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel is also comparable 
between the two arms.  Overall, it is considered that this allows a reasonable assessment of safety in this 
patient population.  
The overall number of AEs was comparable between the two arms, however, there were more SAEs, 
Grade 3/4 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the crb+pac+bev arm. There were considerably more 
cases of non-CNS bleedings, hypertension, proteinuria and thromboembolic events. Neutropenia, wound 
healing complications and GI perforations were also reported more frequently in the bevacizumab arm. 
These events are expected and observed in clinical trials with bevacizumab. They are clinically 
manageable and are reflected in the SmPC, where precautionary measures are also provided.   
The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal of study treatment was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev compared 
to the chemotherapy only arm. Regarding discontinuation, eighty-seven of 325 patients (27%) 
discontinued bevacizumab during the initial chemotherapy combination treatment phase with a median of 
4 cycles of treatment. Additionally, 227 patients (70%) stopped bevacizumab during the maintenance 
phase with a median of 20 cycles. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  majority  of  patients  were  below  65,  white,  ECOG  0  or  1.  Very  few  patients  were  ECOG  3.  These 
characteristics have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/815114/2017 
Page 70/73 
 
  
  
The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  Grade  5  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment,  and  AESIs  was 
consistent  with  prior  observations  in  patients  aged  >  65  years-old  being  treated  with  bevacizumab. 
However, the relatively small sample sizes preclude any very strong conclusions.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The observed improvement in median overall survival of almost half year is clinically relevant. These 
findings are further supported by the PFS results, which are in line with the PFS results observed in study 
AVF4095g that led to the extension of the indication to use bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin 
and gemcitabine in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. However, the added benefit comes at a cost. 
There are more SAE, AESI and discontinuations in the bevacizumab arm, but there are no new safety 
findings, and the safety profile is consistent with previous studies. The discontinuation rate of 25% is not 
unexpected in this setting and is also in line with previous findings.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance is positive for Avastin in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in the 
treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or 
primary peritoneal cancer, who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF 
inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
There were insufficient data to support a positive benefit-risk balance for Avastin in combination with 
carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for treatment of adult 
patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal 
cancer who have received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-
targeted agents. There is no clear benefit of treating patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab in first-
line, with bevacizumab at first platinum-sensitive relapse while the risk of AEs remains. Furthermore, 
strong scientific rationale to support removing the limitation from the current SmPC has not been 
presented.

Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Avastin is positive in the following indication: in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel, for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or 
other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one  
Extension of indication to include the use of Avastin in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the 
for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube 
or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF 
inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated with efficacy and safety information from study GOG-0213. The Package Leaflet and 
RMP (v. 27.1) are updated in accordance.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Avastin is not similar to Yondelis and Lynparza within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
HETLIOZ is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) in totally blind 
adults.   
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Dose and timing 
The recommended dose is 20 mg (1 capsule) tasimelteon per day taken one hour before bedtime, at the same 
time every night.  
HETLIOZ is intended for chronic use. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended for individuals older than 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Tasimelteon has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore 
caution is recommended when prescribing tasimelteon to patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of tasimelteon in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been 
established.  No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Oral use. Hard capsules should be swallowed whole. Avoid breaking as the powder has an unpleasant taste. 
Tasimelteon should be taken without food; if patients eat a high-fat meal, it is recommended to wait at least 2 
hours before taking tasimelteon (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
After taking tasimelteon, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed.   
Caution should be used when administering tasimelteon in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong 
CYP1A2 inhibitors, particularly those which also inhibit other enzymes involved in the clearance of 
tasimelteon because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and greater risk of adverse 
reactions (see section 4.5). 
Caution should be used when administering tasimelteon in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 
inducers because of a potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy (see section 
4.5). 
Patients should be instructed to initiate tasimelteon treatment without regard to circadian phase.  Physicians 
should evaluate patient response to tasimelteon 3 months after treatment initiation utilising a clinician 
interview to assess their overall functioning with an emphasis on sleep-wake complaints.   
Excipients 
HETLIOZ hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance,  
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
HETLIOZ hard capsules contain the azo colouring agent Orange Yellow S (E110), which may cause allergic 
reactions.  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect tasimelteon 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are enzymes identified to play a role in the metabolism of tasimelteon, with a minor 
role for CYP2C9/C19.  Medicinal products that inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 have been shown to alter the 
metabolism of tasimelteon in vivo.   
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin)  
Caution should be used when administering tasimelteon in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong 
CYP1A2 inhibitors such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon 
exposure and greater risk of adverse reactions: the AUC0-inf and Cmax of tasimelteon increased by 7-fold and 
2-fold, respectively, when co-administered with fluvoxamine 50 mg (after 6 days of fluvoxamine 50 mg per 
day). This is deemed even more important for strong CYP1A2 inhibitors also inhibiting other enzymes 
involved in the clearance of tasimelteon (e.g. fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin). 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole)  
Tasimelteon exposure was increased by approximately 50% when co-administered with ketoconazole 
400 mg (after 5 days of ketoconazole 400 mg per day).  The clinical relevance of this single factor is unclear, 
but with increased exposure caution is recommended to monitor the patient. 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) 
Use of tasimelteon should be avoided in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers because of a 
potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy: the exposure of tasimelteon 
decreased by approximately 90% when co-administered with rifampin 600 mg (after 11 days of rifampin 
600 mg per day). 
Smoking (moderate CYP1A2 inducer) 
Tasimelteon exposure decreased by approximately 40% in smokers compared to non-smokers (see section 
5.2).    The patient should be instructed to cease or reduce smoking while taking tasimelteon. 
Beta blockers 
The efficacy of tasimelteon may be reduced in patients with concomitant administration of beta adrenergic 
receptor antagonists. Monitoring of efficacy is recommended where if efficacy is not achieved by a patient 
on beta blocker medication, the physician may consider whether a substitution of another non-beta-blocker 
medication for the beta blocker is warranted or discontinue the use of Hetlioz. 
Potential effect of alcohol on tasimelteon 
In a study of 28 healthy volunteers, a single dose of ethanol (0.6 g/kg for women and 0.7 g/kg for men) was 
co-administered with a 20 mg dose of tasimelteon. On some psychomotor test measures (intoxication, drunk, 
alertness/drowsiness, balance platform test), there was a trend towards greater effects of tasimelteon plus 
ethanol versus ethanol alone, but the effects were not deemed significant. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of tasimelteon in pregnant women. In animal studies, 
administration of tasimelteon during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofoetal mortality, 
neurobehavioural impairment, and decreased growth and development in offspring) at doses greater than 
those used clinically. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of tasimelteon during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tasimelteon/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child 
cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from tasimelteon therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
4 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data on the effects of tasimelteon on human fertility.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies showed that oestrous cycles were prolonged in rats treated with high doses of tasimelteon, with no 
effect on mating performance or male fertility, and only a marginal effect on female fertility.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tasimelteon may cause somnolence, and therefore may have an influence on driving and using machines.  
After taking tasimelteon, patients should limit their activity to preparing to go to bed and not use machines 
because tasimelteon can impair performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (>3%) during clinical trials were headache (10.4%), somnolence 
(8.6%), nausea (4.0%), and dizziness (3.1%).  The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly 
mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 2.3% of tasimelteon-treated patients. The most 
frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: somnolence (0.23%), nightmare (0.23%), and 
headache (0.17%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following are adverse reactions that were reported in tasimelteon-treated adult patients, derived from 
patient trials in 1772 patients treated with tasimelteon.  The following terms and frequencies are applied and 
presented by MedDRA System Organ Class: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000).  Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited clinical experience with the effects of an overdose of tasimelteon.  
As with the management of any overdose, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be used, 
along with immediate gastric lavage, where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as 
needed. Respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate vital signs should be monitored, and 
general supportive measures employed. 
While haemodialysis was effective at clearing tasimelteon and the majority of its major metabolites in 
patients with renal impairment, it is not known if hemodialysis will effectively reduce exposure in the case of 
overdose. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, melatonin receptor agonists, ATC code: N05CH03 
Mechanism of action 
Tasimelteon is a circadian regulator that resets the master body clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).  
Tasimelteon acts as a Dual Melatonin Receptor Agonist (DMRA) with selective agonist activity at the MT1 
and MT2 receptors.  These receptors are thought to be involved in the control of circadian rhythms. 
The master body clock regulates the circadian rhythms of hormones including melatonin and cortisol and 
aligns/synchronises the physiological processes of the sleep-wake cycle and metabolic and cardiovascular 
homeostasis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Tasimelteon functions as a DMRA at the MT1 and MT2 receptors.  Tasimelteon exhibits a greater affinity for 
the MT2 as compared to the MT1 receptor. The most abundant metabolites of tasimelteon have less than one-
tenth of the binding affinity of the parent molecule for both the MT1 and MT2 receptors. 
Tasimelteon and its most abundant metabolites have no appreciable affinity for more than 160 other 
pharmacologically relevant receptors. This includes the GABA receptor complex, the binding site for 
sedative hypnotics, and receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, 
and opiates.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The effectiveness of tasimelteon in the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) was 
established in two randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group studies (SET 
and RESET) in totally blind patients with Non-24. 
In SET, 84 patients with Non-24 (median age 54 years) were randomised to receive tasimelteon 20 mg or 
placebo, one hour prior to bedtime, at the same time every night for up to 6 months. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
RESET was a randomised withdrawal trial in 20 patients with Non-24 (median age 55 years) that was 
designed to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of tasimelteon after 12-weeks. Patients were treated for 
approximately 12 weeks with tasimelteon 20 mg one hour prior to bedtime, at the same time every night. 
Patients in whom the calculated time of peak melatonin level (melatonin acrophase) occurred at 
approximately the same time of day (in contrast to the expected daily delay) during the run-in phase were 
randomised to receive placebo or continue daily treatment with tasimelteon 20 mg for 8 weeks. 
SET and RESET assessed entrainment of the master body clock as measured by aMT6s and cortisol.  Both 
studies demonstrated the ability of tasimelteon to entrain the master body clock in patients with Non-24 and 
RESET demonstrated that continued daily dosing of tasimelteon is necessary to maintain entrainment. 
Entrainment in Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder 
In SET, tasimelteon entrained circadian rhythms at month 1 at a significantly higher rate than placebo as 
measured by aMT6s and cortisol (20% vs. 2.6 % and 17.5% vs 2.6% respectively). Analyses of entrainment 
at month 7 in a subset of patients demonstrated that 59% of tasimelteon-treated patients entrained by month 7 
indicating that response to treatment may take weeks or months for some patients to respond.  RESET 
demonstrated the maintenance of entrainment with tasimelteon treatment compared to placebo withdrawal 
(aMT6s: 90% vs. 20% and cortisol: 80% vs. 20%). 
Clinical Response in Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder 
The effectiveness of tasimelteon in the treatment of clinical symptoms, including the circadian sleep-wake 
cycle and clinical global functioning in patients with Non-24 was established in SET and RESET (Table 3).  
A composite scale of 4 measures of duration and timing of nighttime and daytime sleep and global 
functioning was used to evaluate clinical response in SET.  Entrainment plus a score ≥3 on this scale, called 
Non-24 Clinical Response Scale (N24CRS) was required to be classified as a clinical responder.  The 
components of the scale can be found in Table 2.

>30 minutes increase and a standard deviation <2 
hours during double-masked phase 
<2.0 from the average of Day 112 and Day 183 
compared to baseline 
Clinical response in sleep-wake amount and timing measures 
SET and RESET evaluated the duration and timing of nighttime sleep and daytime naps via patient-recorded 
diaries. During SET, patient diaries were recorded for an average of 88 days during screening and 133 days 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during randomisation.  During RESET, patient diaries were recorded for an average of 57 days during the 
run-in phase and 59 days during the randomised-withdrawal phase. 
Because symptoms of nighttime sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness are cyclical in patients with Non-24, 
with severity varying according to the state of alignment of the individual patient’s circadian rhythm with the 
24-hour day (least severe when fully aligned, most severe when 12 hours out of alignment), efficacy 
endpoints for nighttime total sleep time and daytime nap duration were based on the 25% of nights with the 
least nighttime sleep, and the 25% of days with the most daytime nap time. In SET, patients in the 
tasimelteon group had, at baseline, an average 195 minutes of nighttime sleep and 137 minutes of daytime 
nap time on the 25% of most symptomatic nights and days, respectively.  The average timing of sleep 
relative to an individual’s desired period for consolidated sleep over at least one circadian period was 
assessed.  Treatment with tasimelteon resulted in a significant improvement, compared with placebo, for all 
of these endpoints in SET and RESET (see Table 3).

Response in Clinical Global Functioning Measures 
Patients treated with tasimelteon experienced an overall improvement in clinical global functioning (CGI-
C = 2.6) as compared to patients treated with placebo who showed no improvement status (CGI-C = 3.4) 
compared to the severity of Non-24 at baseline (LS mean difference = -0.8; p=0.0093) (Table 4). The 
effectiveness of tasimelteon to improve clinical global functioning was evaluated in SET.  The Clinical 
Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) is a reflection of the general social, occupational, and health 
functioning of the patient and is evaluated on a 7-point scale, centered at No Change (4), that investigators 
8 
 
 
 
 
used to rate the patients’ improvement from baseline in symptoms of global functioning. It was rated as:       
1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally 
worse; 6 = much worse; or 7 = very much worse.

See section 4.8 for safety information. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with HETLIOZ 
in one or more subsets of the paediatric population who are totally blind with Non-24. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon is linear over doses ranging from 3 to 300 mg (0.15 to 15 times the 
recommended daily dosage). The pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon and its metabolites did not change with 
repeated daily dosing. 
Absorption 
The peak concentration (Tmax) of tasimelteon occurred approximately 0.5 hours after fasted oral 
administration. The mean absolute oral bioavailability of tasimelteon is 38%. 
When administered with a high-fat meal, the Cmax of tasimelteon was 44% lower than when administered in a 
fasted state, and the median Tmax was delayed by approximately 1.75 hours. Therefore, tasimelteon should be 
taken without food; if patients eat a high-fat meal, it is recommended to wait at least 2 hours before taking 
tasimelteon. 
Distribution 
The apparent oral volume of distribution at steady state of tasimelteon in young healthy subjects is 
approximately 59 - 126 L. At therapeutic concentrations, tasimelteon is about 88.6 – 90.1% bound to 
proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Tasimelteon is extensively metabolised. Metabolism of tasimelteon consists primarily of oxidation at 
multiple sites and oxidative dealkylation resulting in opening of the dihydrofuran ring followed by further 
oxidation to give a carboxylic acid. CYP1A2 (35.4%) and CYP3A4 (24.3%) are the major enzymes 
identified to play a role in the metabolism of tasimelteon.  CYP2C9 (18.8%) and CYP2C19 (15.1%) also 
contribute to the metabolism of tasimelteon. Tasimelteon clearance does not appear to be affected by 
polymorphisms in these enzymes. 
Phenolic glucuronidation is the major phase II metabolic route. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Major metabolites had 13-fold or less activity at melatonin receptors compared to tasimelteon. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of radiolabeled tasimelteon, 80% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine 
and approximately 4% in faeces, resulting in a mean recovery of 84%. Less than 1% of the dose was 
excreted in urine as the parent compound. 
The observed mean elimination half-life for tasimelteon is 1.3 ± 0.4 hours. The mean terminal elimination 
half-life ± standard deviation of the main metabolites ranges from 1.3 ± 0.5 to 3.7 ± 2.2. 
Repeated once daily dosing with tasimelteon does not result in changes in pharmacokinetic parameters or 
significant accumulation of tasimelteon. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In elderly subjects, tasimelteon exposure increased by approximately two-fold compared to non-elderly 
adults.  Due to the overall inter-subject variability of tasimelteon, this increase is not clinically meaningful 
and dose adjustment is not recommended. 
Gender 
The mean overall exposure of tasimelteon was approximately 1.6-fold greater in female than in male 
subjects.  Due to the overall inter-subject variability of tasimelteon, this increase is not clinically meaningful 
and dose adjustment is not recommended. 
Race 
Race does not affect apparent clearance of tasimelteon. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetic profile of a 20 mg dose of tasimelteon was compared among 8 subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score ≥5 and ≤6 points), 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Score ≥7 and ≤9 points), and 13 healthy matched controls. Tasimelteon exposure was increased 
less than two-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Tasimelteon has not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore caution is recommended when prescribing HETLIOZ to 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetic profile of a 20 mg dose of tasimelteon was compared among 8 subjects with severe 
renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73m2), 8 subjects with end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2) requiring hemodialysis, and 16 healthy matched 
controls. There was no apparent relationship between tasimelteon CL/F and renal function, as measured by 
either estimated creatinine clearance or eGFR. Subjects with severe renal impairment had a 30% lower CL/F 
clearance than match controls; however, when variability is taken into account, the different was not 
significant. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. 
Smokers (smoking is a moderate CYP1A2 inducer) 
Tasimelteon exposure decreased by approximately 40% in smokers, compared to non-smokers (see section 
4.5).  The patient should be instructed to cease or reduce smoking while taking tasimelteon. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and 
development. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
Reproductive toxicology  
In pregnant rats administered tasimelteon during the period of organogenesis, there were no effects on 
embryofoetal development. In pregnant rabbits administered tasimelteon during the period of organogenesis, 
embryolethality and embryofoetal toxicity (reduced foetal body weight and delayed ossification) were 
observed at the highest dose tested (200 mg/kg/day).  
Oral administration of tasimelteon  to rats throughout organogenesis and lactation resulted in persistent 
reductions in body weight, delayed sexual maturation and physical development,  neurobehavioural 
impairment in offspring at the highest dose tested, andreduced body weight in offspring at the mid-dose 
tested. The no effect dose (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 25 times the RHD on a mg/m2 basis. 
Carcinogenesis 
No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice; the highest dose tested is approximately 75 
times the RHD of 20 mg/day, on a mg/m2 basis. In rats, the incidence of liver tumours was increased in 
males (adenoma and carcinoma) and females (adenoma) at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day; the incidence of tumours 
of the uterus (endometrial adenocarcinoma) and uterus and cervix (squamous cell carcinoma) were increased 
at 250 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in tumours at the lowest dose tested in rats, which is approximately 
10 times the recommended human doseon a mg/m2 basis.

Package leaflet: Information for the patient 
HETLIOZ 20 mg hard capsules 
tasimelteon 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even if 
their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What HETLIOZ is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before you take HETLIOZ  
3.  How to take HETLIOZ  
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store HETLIOZ 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What HETLIOZ is and what it is used for 
HETLIOZ contains the active substance tasimelteon.  This type of medicine is called a “melatonin agonist” 
that acts as a regulator of daily body rhythms. 
It is used to treat Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) in adults who are totally blind. 
How HETLIOZ works 
In sighted people, the change in light levels between day and night helps to synchronise internal body 
rhythms, including feeling sleepy at night and being active during the day. The body controls these rhythms 
through many pathways including increases and decreases in the production of the hormone melatonin.  
Patients with Non-24 who are totally blind cannot see light, so their body rhythms shift out of alignment with 
the 24-hour world, resulting in periods of feeling sleepy during the day and the inability to sleep at night. The 
active substance in HETLIOZ, tasimelteon, is able to act as a time-keeper for the body rhythms and resets 
them each day.  It aligns body rhythms with the usual 24-hour day and night cycle and so improve sleep 
patterns. Because of individual differences in each person’s body rhythms, it could take weeks or up to 3 
months for an improvement in symptoms to be noticed.  
2.  What you need to know before you take HETLIOZ  
Do not take HETLIOZ if 
You are allergic to tasimelteon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
After taking HETLIOZ, you should get ready to go to bed and only carry out activities that you would 
normally do before going to bed. 
Children and adolescents 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Do not give HETLIOZ to children under the age of 18 years.  This is because HETLIOZ has not been tested 
in people under 18 years of age and the effects are unknown.  
Other medicines and HETLIOZ 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  This 
includes:  
-  medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP1A2’.  An example is 
fluvoxamine, which is used to treat depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).   
-  medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP3A4’.  An example is 
ketoconazole, which is used to treat fungal infections. 
-  medicines known to increase the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP3A4’.  An example is rifampicin, 
which is used to treat tuberculosis (TB). 
-  medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP2C19’.  An example is 
omeprazole, which is used to treat hearburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
-  medicines called “beta blockers” used to treat high blood pressure and other heart problems.  Some 
examples include atenolol, metoprolol, and propanolol. 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
HETLIOZ. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to 
avoid the use of tasimelteon during pregnancy.  If you become pregnant while taking HETLIOZ, consult 
your doctor immediately as it is recommended not to take HETLIOZ while you are pregnant or breast 
feeding. 
HETLIOZ contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before 
taking this medicine. 
HETLIOZ contains Orange Yellow S (E110) 
Tell your doctor if you have an allergy to Orange Yellow S (E110).  HETLIOZ contains Orange Yellow S 
(E110) which may cause allergic reactions. 
HETLIOZ contains sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take HETLIOZ 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much to take 
The recommended dose is one capsule every night, taken one hour before you go to bed. Try to take the 
medicine at the same time every night.  Because of individual differences in each person’s body rhythms, it 
could take weeks or months for you to notice an improvement in your symptoms.  Therefore, your doctor 
may ask you to take HETLIOZ for up to 3 months before checking if it is working for you. 
Taking HETLIOZ 
-  Take the medicine by mouth. 
-  Swallow the capsule whole.  
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
It is best to take HETLIOZ on an empty stomach as food can reduce the amount of the medicine that 
is absorbed into your body.  If you eat a high-fat meal close to the time you would normally take the 
medicine, it is best to wait 2 hours before taking HETLIOZ.  
-  To open the bottle, push the cap down and turn counter-clockwise. 
If you take more HETLIOZ than you should 
If you accidentally take more HETLIOZ than your doctor recommended, contact your doctor at once or 
contact the nearest hospital for advice. Keep the bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you 
have taken. 
If you forget to take HETLIOZ 
-  Skip the missed dose.  Take your next dose at the usual time the next day. Do not take a double dose. 
If you stop taking HETLIOZ 
Do not stop taking HETLIOZ without talking to your doctor. 
- 
If HETLIOZ is not taken every night, the body rhythms will lose alignment with the usual 24-hour 
day and night cycle again.  This means that  symptoms will come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

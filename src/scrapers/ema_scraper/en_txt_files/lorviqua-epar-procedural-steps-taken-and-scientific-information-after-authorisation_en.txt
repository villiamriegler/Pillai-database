C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Hypertension has been reported in patients receiving 
lorlatinib. Blood pressure should be controlled prior to 
initiation of lorlatinib. Blood pressure should be monitored 
after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during 
treatment with lorlatinib. Lorlatinib should be withheld and 
resumed at a reduced dose or permanently discontinued 
based on severity. 
Hyperglycaemia has occurred in patients receiving 
lorlatinib. Fasting serum glucose should be assessed prior 
to initiation of lorlatinib and monitored periodically 
thereafter according to national guidelines. Lorlatinib 
should be withheld and resumed at a reduced dose or 
permanently discontinued based on severity. 
Section 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC were also updated to 
reflect the information regarding hypertension and 
hyperglycaemia in the recommended lorlatinib dose 
modifications and adverse reactions, respectively.

lorlatinib in subjects with impaired renal function). 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to include information regarding drug drug 
interaction with moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers based 
on study B7461026 (Phase 1, open-label, fixed

multiple doses of modafinil on the pharmacokinetics 
of single dose lorlatinib in healthy participants).

normal renal function and varying degrees of renal 
impairment showed that the exposure (AUCinf) to lorlatinib 
increased approximately 4%, 19% and 41% for the mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment groups, 
respectively. No starting dose adjustments are 
recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. A reduced dose of lorlatinib is recommended in 
patients with severe renal impairment (absolute eGFR < 30 
mL/min), e.g. a once daily starting dose of 75 mg taken 
orally. 
The results of study B7461026 showed a decrease in 
lorlatinib exposure in healthy adult participants under 
fasting conditions when administered following multiple 
doses of modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer compared 
with lorlatinib given alone. The adjusted geometric mean 
for AUCinf and Cmax values of lorlatinib decreased 
approximately by 23% and 22%, respectively, in the 
presence of modafinil however no clinically meaningful 
changes in liver function tests were seen. Concomitant use 
of modafinil did not have a clinically meaningful effect on 
lorlatinib pharmacokinetics.

databases for all reported cases including psychotic effects 
and changes in cognitive function, mood, mental status or 
speech, the term “Psychotic effects” was selected to be the 
cluster term for these AEs to be consistent with other CNS 
effects (cluster terms: Cognitive effects, Mood effects, and 
Speech effects). In addition, the cluster term “Psychotic 
effects” includes all AEs that are components of the cluster

term “Hallucinations.” Therefore, the cluster term 
“Hallucinations” is replaced with the cluster term “Psychotic 
effects” in the SmPC. In addition, a new ADR of “mental 
status changes” have been added to the SmPC section 4.8 
with a “common” frequency.

on CYP2C9, P-gp, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1 substrates

regarding ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
added clarification regarding linearity/non-linearity of 
500 mg tolbutamide for CYP2C9, 500 mg acetaminophen 
for UGT, and 60 mg fexofenadine for P-gp) were 
administered alone and then in combination with repeated 
dosing of lorlatinib (100 mg once daily). On the basis of the 
results of this study, lorlatinib can be considered as a weak 
inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and UGT. However, patients

should be monitored in case of concomitant treatment with 
medicinal products with narrow therapeutic indices

been shown to be a moderate inducer of P-gp and 
medicinal products that are P- gp substrates with narrow 
therapeutic indices should be used with caution in 
combination with lorlatinib.

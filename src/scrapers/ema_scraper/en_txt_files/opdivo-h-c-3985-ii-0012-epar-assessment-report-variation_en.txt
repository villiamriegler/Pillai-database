2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy characterised by the presence of multinucleated 
Reed-Sternberg cells, which usually account for only 1% to 10% of the cells in the tumour tissue. 
Classical HL is characterized by small numbers of Reed-Sternberg cells within an extensive but ineffective 
inflammatory and immune-cell infiltrate. PD-L1 and PD-L2 is over expressed on Reed-Sternberg (R-S) 
cells.  
The majority of cells in HL tumour tissue are a mixed infiltrate of various lymphoid cells, including effector 
and regulatory T-cells and macrophage.  The updated 2008 WHO classification recognizes 2 histologic 
groups: nodular lymphocyte predominant, which accounts for about 5% of all HL cases and classical HL 
(cHL) which accounts for the remaining 95%.  
There are marked geographic epidemiologic differences in HL with highly variable incidence rates due to 
age, ethnicity, region, prior infections and other factors. The median age HL is diagnosed in the US is 38 
years, where the incidence is highest between 15 and 34 years, declines between ages 35 and 54, and 
increases again after 55 years. In 2015, the National Cancer Institute estimated that 9,050 men and 
women would be diagnosed with HL in the US and 1,150 would die of HL.  The incidence in Europe is 
approximately 2.4 cases per 100,000 persons. 
Hodgkin Lymphoma is a potentially curable disease in first line patients, with a cure rate of approximately 
80% with the use of current therapies.  For patients who relapse, treatment of choice consists of a 
chemotherapy regimen (different than that used in the first line) followed by high dose chemotherapy and 
autologous stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy. After the initial multi-drug treatment 
regimen, approximately 5% to 10% of patients with HL suffer from primary refractory disease, defined as 
no response or progression within 90 days of treatment, and an additional 10 to 30% will relapse. In this 
population, an additional 10% to 30% will relapse. Once a subject undergoes ASCT and subsequently 
relapses, the outcomes are generally poor and efficacious therapeutic options are limited. The median OS 
of patients who relapse after ASCT was initially reported to be < 1 year; more recent data suggests that 
the median OS is evolving and may be closer to 2 years because of the availability of newer therapies like 
brentuximab vedotin (see Table 1).  
Nivolumab is a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) blocking antibody that is currently approved as 
OPDIVO in the US, EU, Japan and other countries. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) 
monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor on T cells and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and 
PD-L2, releasing the T cells from PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including 
the anti-tumour immune response. The genes encoding the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are located 
on chromosome 9p24.1. Recurrent genetic alterations in 9p24.1 in R-S cell in cHL (including 
amplification, copy gain, and polysomy) and associated overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in R-S cells 
may have prognostic significance and may also be predictive of response to nivolumab. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL): 
• 
• 
after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with brentuximab vedotin, or 
after at least two prior therapies in patients who are not candidates for ASCT.  
The final agreed indication is as follows:

Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) 
OPDIVO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with brentuximab vedotin. 
. 
Section 4.2 
Posology 
Treatment must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. 
OPDIVO as monotherapy 
The recommended dose of OPDIVO is 3 mg/kg nivolumab administered intravenously over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks. 
Treatment with OPDIVO, either as a monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab, should be continued 
as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the 
“Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment and 
as such a justification is provided for not submitting an Environmental Risk Assessment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. The justification was acceptable as nivolumab contains 
proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) and no risk to the environment is expected.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data was submitted in this application. It is not anticipated to lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure to the use of nivolumab. Therefore, nivolumab is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nivolumab clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, 
drug-drug interaction potential, and dose selection for phase 2/3 studies was well characterized and 
described in the marketing authorization procedure (see EPAR Opdivo). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 10/85 
 
  
  
 
 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory classical 
Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) have been 
characterized with data from phase 2 Study CA209205 and Phase 1 Study CA209039.  
These studies have been used to update the population pharmacokinetics model and to perform the 
exposure-response (E-R) (efficacy and safety) models (pharmacodynamic section).  
Additionally, an immunogenicity analysis across studies CA209205 and CA209039 and an integrated 
immunogenicity analysis across tumour types were performed to assess the incidence and potential effect 
of immunogenicity on nivolumab treatment. 
The recommended dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy for cHL is the same as that approved for 
melanoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer (SQ NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
monotherapy: 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes Q2W. 
Special populations 
Population Pharmacokinetic (PPK) Model 
The PPK analysis was performed using data from 4 Phase 1 studies (MDX1106-01, MDX1106-03, 
ONO-4538-01 [CA209005], and CA209039), 4 Phase 2 studies (CA209010, ONO-4538-02, CA209063, 
and CA209205) and 3 Phase 3 studies (CA209017, CA209057, and CA209025), with a total of 1677 
patients included. Data from Study CA209037 was not included as baseline serum albumin levels were 
not available in this study. Inclusion of data from studies CA209039 (cHL cohort treated with nivolumab 
monotherapy)* and CA209205 (all subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy, cohort A+B+C)** 
allowed for the assessment of nivolumab PK in subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL. Bioanalytical 
methods used for quantifying nivolumab serum concentrations across the development program were 
cross-validated, thereby allowed merging of the exposure data for PPK analysis. 
*CA209039:  PPK (cHL: all cohorts; N = 23 patients); E-R efficacy (cHL: ASCT – brentuximab failure 
cohort; N = 15 patients); E-R safety (cHL: all cohorts; N = 23 patients). Nominal PK Sampling Schedule: 
W1D1: 0, 1, 3, 24-72, 168, 336, 504 h; W6D1: 0 h; W12D1: 0, 1 h; W20D1: 0 h; Q16W: 0 h (1st year); 
Q32W: 0 h (2nd year); FU visit 1 and 2. 
**CA209205:  PPK (cHL: all cohort; N=170 patients [239 subject treated; 206 subjects in PK database 
and 36 subjects excluded since only pre-treated sample were available for them]); E-R efficacy (cHL: 
failure of brentuximab following ASCT cohort; N=77 patients); E-R safety (cHL: all cohort; N=170 
patients). Nominal PK Sampling Schedule: C1D1: predose: C3D1: predose: C7D1: predose; C13D1: 
predose; Q12C: predose; FU visit 1 and 2. 
The PPK model was developed using a previously developed final model and included the effect of tumour 
type (cHL, RCC, NSCLC, or other), immunogenicity, and albumin on CL. The final model was a 
2-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion input and first-order elimination with a proportional 
residual error model. The final PPK model included effects of baseline WT, eGFR, PS, ALB, tumour type, 
and anti-drug antibody (ADA) status on CL and baseline WT, sex, and NSCLC histology (using the 
combined SQ and NSQ groups) on VC. 
Estimates of Individual Exposure 
A summary of the individual PK parameter estimates obtained from the final PPK model for patients with 
solid tumours and cHL is provided in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. A separate table summarising the 
individual measures of exposure for only the subjects enrolled in studies CA209205 and CA209039 (who 
received nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W) is provided in Table 5.

Evaluation of the Effect of Tumor Type on Nivolumab CL and Exposure 
Nivolumab CL and exposure (measured as dose-normalized Cavgss, other exposure measurements are 
highly correlated with Cavgss) appear to be similar across NSCLC, RCC, and other tumour types as shown 
in Figure 1and Figure 2, suggesting that nivolumab PK is independent of tumour type for the types tested. 
cHL tumour type was associated with a 32% lower nivolumab CL relative to the reference value as

determined in NSCLC. The decrease in CL resulted in a 43% increase in nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) in 
cHL subjects.

Evaluation of the Effect of Immunogenicity on Nivolumab CL 
The effects of immunogenicity on nivolumab PK in cHL subjects were consistent with previous analyses. 
Nivolumab clearance was approximately 13% greater in the presence of nivolumab ADA. 
Evaluation of the Effect of Age on Nivolumab CL 
Given the relatively younger age in the cHL population (median age of 35 years versus 61 years in the 
overall analysis population), the effect of age on nivolumab CL was also evaluated. The effects of age on 
nivolumab PK in cHL subjects were consistent with the previous analyses. Age did not affect nivolumab 
CL. There was no change in nivolumab CL with either an increase in age from the median value of 61 years

to the 95th percentile value of 77 years (increase of 0.5%), or with a decrease in age from the median 
value to the 5th percentile value of 31 years (decrease of 1.5%). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The recommended dose for nivolumab monotherapy is 3 mg/kg Q2W which has been investigated across 
melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, and cHL indications. Combined results from both CA209205 and CA209039 
showed that patients with cHL after failure of ASCT and brentuximab treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
Q2W had an ORR of 65.3% by IRRC assessment and 74.7% by investigator assessment. These results are 
further supported by E-R analyses, which examined the relationship between exposure and IRRC and 
investigator-assessed OR and the relationship between nivolumab exposure and probability of Grade 3+ 
drug-related adverse events. The E-R efficacy analysis showed a relationship between exposure and 
IRRC-assessed OR; however, the proportion of OR plateaued at greater exposures. Further, E-R analysis 
on investigator-assessed OR indicated that there was a flat relationship between nivolumab exposure and 
OR. No trend was observed between nivolumab exposure and the risk of G3+ DR-AEs, as nivolumab 
Cavgss was not a significant predictor of G3+ DR-AEs.  
Immunogenicity Results from Study CA209205 and CA209039 
A summary of the ADA assessments for nivolumab subjects on Study CA209205 and CA209039 who had 
evaluable ADA data at baseline and on treatment is presented in Table 6.

Summary of anti-drug antibody assessment in study CA209205 and CA209039, 
based on 16-week definition for persistent positive - all nivolumab treated 
subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment 
There were 2 (1.1%) subjects who were ADA positive (last sample positive). No subject was considered 
persistent positive and no subjects were neutralizing ADA positive. The greatest titer value was 32. 
Among those two subjects who were ADA positive, one subject developed ADA after 2 doses (Day 29) of 
nivolumab, went on to experience a partial response, and continued treatment to Day 169. The other 
subject had stable disease while on study and ADA was developed after 18 doses of nivolumab (Day 249).  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The exposure-response relationship was characterized for nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) and OR using 
data from 92 previously treated subjects with cHL after failure of both ASCT and brentuximab vedotin 
treatment from studies CA209205 (cohort B) and CA209039 (ASCT-Bren failure cHL cohort), who had 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 14/85 
 
  
  
 
 
exposure data available. The relationship between the nivolumab exposure and OR was characterized 
using a logistic regression model that incorporated the effects of covariates that may modulate the E-R 
relationship. The covariate variables investigated in the E-R analysis of OR included age, baseline body 
weight, sex, PD-L1 status, chromosome 9p24.1, ECOG, number of prior therapies, and nivolumab 
Cavgss. 
Figure 3: 
Effect of predictors on investigator-assessed OR (full model) for cHL (Studies 
CA209205 and CA209039) 
A visual predictive check of the ER analysis on investigator-assessed OR (Figure 4) showed that the 
observed proportion of investigator-assessed OR at each quartile of log(Cavgss) lies well within the 
corresponding 90% PI (Pred proportion), obtained by simulation from the final model, indicating that the 
model is consistent with the observed data.

Exposure-Response Analysis for Safety in cHL: G3+ DR-AEs 
The E-R relationship for safety was characterized for nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) and G3+ DR-AEs in 
193 previously treated subjects with cHL who failed ASCT with or without brentuximab vedotin in studies 
CA209205 (cohort A+B+C) and CA209039 (all cHL cohort), and who had exposure data available. The 
relationship between nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) and time to G3+ DR-AEs was described by a 
semi-parametric CPH model, and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on the E-R 
relationship. Figure 5 presents the estimated effects of all of the predictor variables on the hazard of G3+ 
DR-AEs in the Full Model.  
The covariate ECOG status was a significant predictor of experiencing a Grade 3+ DR-AE in the final 
model. A patient with ECOG score ≥ 1 is 2.14 times more likely to experience a Grade 3+ DR-AE 
compared to a subject with ECOG status of 0. Baseline weight, age, sex, and prior brentuximab therapy 
were not significant predictors of the risk of Grade 3+ DR-AEs in patients with cHL.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Studies CA209205 and CA209039, conducted with cHL patients, have been used to update the population 
pharmacokinetics model and to performed the exposure-response (efficacy and safety) models. The ORR 
observed in this population and the flat E-R safety relationship support the recommended dose and 
schedule of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W in the treatment of cHL after failure of ASCT and brentuximab. 
In the population PK model, differences in clearance (cHL tumour type was associated with a 32% lower 
nivolumab CL relative to the reference value as determined in NSCLC) and beta half-life parameters have 
been observed between patients with solid tumours and patients with cHL. These differences could be 
attributed to the limited and sparse sampling in cHL. However, main reasons for these differences should 
be other factors in relations with performance status due to previous treatments or in relation with course 
of disease. It should be noted that the distribution of subjects with better PS (PS =0) was slightly different 
in subjects with cHL (52.8%) versus subjects with solid tumours (41.5%). Although nivolumab clearance 
was approximately 13% greater in the patients with worse PS (PS=1), the effect was not considered 
clinically meaningful because the magnitude was modest. Thus, while having a slightly different 
distribution of PS may contribute to the cHL tumour type effect, it may not fully explain the difference due 
to the relatively small effect. Age could be also a potential factor with impact on these results. It should 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 17/85 
 
  
  
 
 
be noted that a relevant proportion of younger population in the population PK model has been included 
due to cHL population. However, age has been analysed as covariate and it is not expected to have a 
relevant impact on nivolumab PK. While a conclusive reason for lower CL (i.e., longer beta half-life in cHL) 
is unknown, it may be associated with the lower expression of PD-1 in cHL versus solid tumours. It has 
been reported that tumour-infiltrating T cells from cHL biopsy samples express lower levels of PD-1 
compared to corresponding T cells from solid tumours. Because the target of nivolumab is PD-1 on T cells, 
these differences in PD-1 expression between tumour types may have an effect on the PK of nivolumab. 
Additionally, differences in CL among different diseases due to altered target cell binding have been 
observed for another monoclonal antibody. 
The results of the E-R analysis indicated that the risk of AEs did not increase with increasing nivolumab 
exposure (represented by Cavgss). The findings are consistent with the overall safety profile of 
nivolumab, which has been shown to be well tolerated over a wide dose range (0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).  
With current available safety data (266 treated cHL patients), this increase exposure does not seem to be 
clinically meaningful, although data cannot be considered fully conclusive. The safety profile following 
administration of nivolumab to subjects with cHL can be considered more or less similar to that observed 
in other tumour types, with the exception of the higher frequency of infusion-related reactions (acute 
infusion related and delayed hypersensitivity reactions) and pyrexia in cHL patients. A total of 30 (26 from 
CA209205 and 4 from CA209039) nivolumab treated subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion 
reactions and all were ADA negative. Thus, the presence of ADA was not associated with the occurrence 
of hypersensitivity and/or infusion-related reactions (see also clinical safety).  
Hence, considering the currently available data, no specific recommendations about dose adjustments or 
specific precaution are required in cHL patients. However, the information included in the SmPC section 
5.2 has been updated and highlights that the decrease in CL observed in cHL patients is not clinically 
meaningful. 
Immunogenicity 
Additionally, an immunogenicity analysis across studies CA209205 and CA209039 and an integrated 
immunogenicity analysis across tumour types were performed to assess the incidence and potential effect 
of immunogenicity on nivolumab treatment. Results in cHL population can be considered in line with the 
results observed previously in other type of tumour. Nivolumab has low immunogenic potential. There 
was no evidence of loss of efficacy in subjects with neutralizing antibodies. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology in cHL patients is considered to be adequately characterised.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W was selected to be studied in heavily pretreated subjects with cHL. 
Combined results from both CA209205 and CA209039 showed that subjects with cHL after failure of ASCT 
and brentuximab treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W had an ORR of 65.3% per IRRC and 74.7% per 
investigator. These results are further supported by ER analyses, which examined the relationship 
between exposure and IRRC and investigator-assessed OR and the relationship between nivolumab 
exposure and probability of ≥Grade 3 dose-related adverse events (AEs) (see PD section).

assessment, and defined as proportion of subjects achieving either a PR or CR according to the 2007 IWG 
criteria. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the duration of objective response (DOR) based on 
IRRC assessments; the CR rate and the duration of CR based on IRRC assessment; the PR rate and the 
duration of PR based on IRRC assessment; and the ORR and DOR based on investigator assessments.

Subjects were assessed for response by imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI]) at screening and on-treatment. Subjects received first dose of nivolumab on Day 1 of 
Week 1. On-treatment assessment began at Week 9 (± 7 days) after the start of nivolumab therapy and 
continued at Weeks 17, 25, 37, and 49 during the first year of treatment, then every 16 weeks (± 14 
days) up to Week 97, continuing every 26 weeks (± 21 days) beyond Week 97, until disease progression 
was documented. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan was required 
at screening, Weeks 17 and 25 in all subjects, and at Week 49 for subjects who did not have two 
consecutive negative FDG-PET scans after Week 1 and prior to Week 49, and to confirm CR. 
The method used to assess PD-L1 expression was an exploratory assay employing the Dako 28-8 
antibody, similar to the verified or validated versions used in other nivolumab solid tumor studies, but 
notably, differed in estimating the percentage of PD-L1 expression based on the number of any detected 
R-S cells rather than on a minimum of 100 malignant cells. 
Sample size 
The planned sample size for this study was to be approximately 320 treated subjects, placed into three 
cohorts of subjects: brentuximab vedotin-naïve (n=60; Cohort A), treatment with brentuximab vedotin 
after failure of ASCT (n=60; Cohort B) and treatment with brentuximab vedotin before or after ASCT 
(n=200; Cohort C). 
The sample size for Cohorts A and B was determined based on 2 considerations: the ability to produce a 
confidence interval (CI), which would exclude an ORR of 20% that is not considered clinically relevant and 
providing sufficient information for a reliable understanding of the safety profile. The sample size for 
Cohort C was empirically determined to support expanded assessment of the benefit-risk profile of 
nivolumab in cHL through observation of less common safety events. 
Randomisation 
The investigator (or designee) enrolled subjects into the study via an IVRS. Since this was a single-arm 
study, all enrolled subjects who met eligibility criteria were treated with nivolumab at 3 mg/kg IV Q2W. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, ie, median, minimum, maximum, and 
mean with standard deviations (SDs). Categorical variables were summarized by frequencies and 
percentages. Percentages were rounded and may not always add up to 100. Times to event distributions 
(ie, DOR, time to response [TTR], PFS, and OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) methodology. 
When appropriate, the median along with 95% CI was provided using Brookmeyer and Crowley 
methodology. Rate at fixed time point (e.g., PFS at 6 months) was derived from the K-M estimate and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 23/85 
 
  
  
 
corresponding CI was derived based on Greenwood formula. CIs for binomial proportions were derived 
using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints were to be performed separately for each cohort. Efficacy data for Cohorts 
A was immature for efficacy analyses. Statistical methods used to analyse these endpoints were the same 
for both IRRC assessments and investigator assessments. 
As sensitivity analyses for ORR, IRRC-assessed ORR and investigator-assessed ORR in response 
evaluable subjects instead of all treated subjects was summarized. Response evaluable subjects were 
subjects with i) a BOR of CR, PR, SD, or progressive disease (PD), ii) target lesion(s) assessed at baseline, 
and iii) at least 1 on-study time point with all baseline target lesion(s) assessed. 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed for DOR based on both IRRC assessment and investigator 
assessment. Subjects who remained alive and had not progressed were censored on the last visit date 
prior to initiation of subsequent cancer therapy. The last visit date was the last date of dosing, evaluable 
tumour assessment or laboratory assessment, whichever occurred last. 
To assess the association between baseline PD-L1 expression and response to nivolumab, the following 
analyses were performed for PD-L1 expression subgroups using a 1% cutoff and for the subgroup of 
subjects without quantifiable PD-L1 in all treated subjects: 
- 
Frequency and percentage of BOR per IRRC.  
-  ORR per IRRC along with its 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
Subjects with an available tumour biopsy specimen tested for 9p24.1 status were classified into the 
following subgroups: polysomy positive, polysomy negative, copy gain positive, copy gain positive, 
amplification positive, amplification negative, and not evaluable for 9p24.1. To assess the association 
between baseline 9p24.1 alteration and response to nivolumab, the following analyses were performed 
for each of the subgroups based on 9p24.1 status: 
- 
Frequency and percentage of BOR per IRRC. 
-  ORR per IRRC along with its 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method.

Subject status summary - All enrolled and treated subjects 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 34 sites in 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, and US). The first patient’s first treatment (FPFT) 
date was 26-Aug-2014 for Cohort B, 19-Sep-2014 for Cohort A, and 13-Feb-2015 for Cohort C, the LPFT 
date was 20-Feb-2015 for Cohort B, 06-Aug-2015 for Cohort A, and 03-Sep-2015 for Cohort C, and the 
LPLV date was 20-Aug-2015 for all 3 cohorts. Thus, the minimum follow-up relative to LPFT was 6 
months, 2 weeks, and 0 day for Cohorts B, A, and C, respectively. The clinical DBL occurred on 
05-Oct-2015 and the IRRC DBL occurred on 20-Oct-2015 for all 3 cohorts. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 25-Apr-2014. The revised protocol incorporated 3 
country-specific amendments, 3 global amendments, and 1 administrative letter. The major amendments 
were related to the how patients were managed for safety and assessed for disease progression during 
the trial. A change in the first assessment for early disease progression would occur at week 9, the first 
PET scan would occur at week 17 instead of week13, permitted subjects to continue treatment beyond 
investigator-assessed disease progression. At the request of a health authority, an IDMC was established 
for amendment 04. The administrative letter announced the change of duration of follow-up for the 
primary endpoint.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: ORR 
Treatment with nivolumab resulted in a rate of IRRC-assessed ORR= 66.3% in Cohort B and 72.5% in 
Investigator-assessed ORR. Concordance rate between IRRC and investigators for objective response 
was 76.3%. The CR rate was 8.8% (7/80) per IRRC and 27.5% (22/80) per investigators.

data cut-off date. Of the 20 responders not considered to have ongoing response (IRRC-assessed), 11 
had events of progression (n=10) or death (n=1), 5 had subsequent anti-cancer therapy (4 underwent 
SCT), 3 were excluded due to censoring prior to 14 weeks of the clinical data cut-off date (2 still on 
treatment), and 1 decided to discontinue the study. 
In order to account for non-uniform and infrequent tumor assessment schedules, a sensitivity analysis 
was performed on DOR by censoring subjects who remained alive and did not progress on the last visit 
date prior to initiation of subsequent cancer therapy. In this analysis, the median DOR per IRRC was not 
reached.

Time to Response (TTR) 
Objective responses achieved with nivolumab in Cohort B subjects occurred early during treatment. The 
median TTR was 2.10 months with a range of 1.6 months to 5.7 months. 31 of the 53 (58.5%) responders 
achieved their response by the time of first scan (9 weeks), and all of the responses were achieved within 
6 months of treatment initiation. The median time to CR was 4.44 months with a range of 3.3 months to 
6.9 months. The median time to PR was 2.10 months with a range of 1.6 months to 5.7 months. 
IRRC-assessed PFS 
With 24 events (23 progressions and 1 death), the median PFS per IRRC was 9.99 months (95% CI: 8.41, 
NA).  The 6-month PFS rate was 76.9% (95% CI: 64.9, 85.3). 
Of the 56 subjects censored for PFS, 53 were censored on-study on last tumour assessment date and the 
remaining 3 subjects on date of first dose. Among the 53 subjects censored on-study on last tumour

assessment date, the reasons for censoring included receiving subsequent anti-cancer therapy (n=9), 
still on-treatment (n=39), progression-free in follow-up (n=4), and off-study due to consent withdrawal 
(n=1). Among the 3 subjects censored on date of first dose, the reasons for censoring were no-baseline 
tumour assessment/no death (n=1) and no on-study tumour assessment/no death (n=2). 
Overall Survival (OS) 
With a median follow-up time for OS of 8.9 months and 3 death events in Cohort B, the median OS was 
not reached. The OS rate at 6 months was 98.7%. 
Survival follow-up was current with 52.5% of subjects in Cohort B having either died or having a last 
known alive date on or after the data cut-off date of 20-Aug-2015. 
Of the 77 subjects who were censored for OS, 51 (63.8%) were still on treatment, 21 (26.3%) were in 
follow-up, and 5 (6.3%) were off study 
Updated efficacy  
The Applicant provided updated efficacy results (DOR, PFS, OS) from the pivotal Study CA209205 Cohort 
B (n=80) with a 12-month minimum follow-up (per the 19-Apr-2016 database lock; 14-Jun-2016 for 
IRRC database lock). Study CA209039 data (n=15) were not updated since mature efficacy data with a 
median follow-up of 23.26 months were presented previously. The efficacy results on the Integrated 
Population (Study CA209205 Cohort B + Study CA209039, n=95) are also provided. Median follow-up in 
the Integrated Population was 15.77 months and CA209205 Cohort B was 15.44 months. 
Among the responders in the Integrated Population, the median DOR using Kaplan-Meier methodology 
increased from 8.74 to 13.14 months per IRRC. The PR rate in the Integrated Population per IRRC with 
longer follow-up appeared durable (57.9% with 6-month follow-up vs 60.0% with 12-month follow-up). 
By extending the follow-up duration in CA209205, the median PFS per IRRC in the Integrated Population 
was updated from 12.55 to 14.78 months and  from 9.99 to 14.78 months in CA209205 Cohort B. In 
addition, OS was 97.9% with 6-month follow-up vs 94.5% with 12-month follow-up in the Integrated 
Population.

Cohort C 
Cohort C subjects (n=100) from the CA209205, provided additional data in the intended target 
population of adult patients with cHL who have received autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and 
treatment with brentuximab vedotin. The primary analysis was recently conducted using the data from 
the April 2016 DBL. The clinical outcomes are summarized below. 
The number of the subjects from each subgroup, per the April 2016 DBL, are shown below: 
•  ASCT and post-transplant treatment with brentuximab vedotin: n=57 (equivalent to Cohort B in 
CA209205) 
•  Brentuximab vedotin treatment only prior to ASCT: n=33 
•  Brentuximab vedotin treatment before and after ASCT: n=8 
•  Others: n=2 (subjects whose sequence of prior brentuximab vedotin and ASCT was unable to be 
determined) 
The median age of Cohort C was 32.0 years, which is similar to that of Cohort A+B+C. There were 3 
subjects (3.0%) aged 65 years or older from Cohort C. The remaining characteristics (eg, gender, race) 
from Cohort C were similar to Cohort A+B+C. The median number of prior systemic regimen received was 
4 for both cohorts. In Cohort C, 29.0% of subjects received 5 or more previous systemic regimen, which 
is lower than 48.8% in Cohort B. 
The median extent of follow-up, 8.84 months, in Cohort C was comparable with median follow-up, 8.92 
months, in Cohort B as of the 06-Oct-2016 DBL (October 2015 DBL) when the primary analysis was 
conducted for Cohort B. 
At the time of the April 2016 DBL, 70.0% of Cohort C subjects were still continuing in the treatment 
period; the most common reason for treatment discontinuation reported was disease progression 
(9.0%), followed by others (8.0%) and study drug toxicity (5.0%). 94.0% of Cohort C subjects were 
continuing in the study (ie, either still on-treatment or off-treatment but in survival follow-up). 9 subjects 
underwent stem cell transplant after discontinuation of nivolumab; all subjects received allogeneic SCT. 
Efficacy endpoints related to tumor response were assessed by IRRC and investigators according to the 
2007 IWG criteria.

•  Subjects Treated Beyond Investigator-assessed Progression 
9 Cohort B subjects who had progressed according to the 2007 IWG criteria as assessed by the 
investigators were subsequently considered eligible per protocol to receive continued nivolumab therapy. 
Among these 9 subjects, the investigator-assessed BOR was PR in 6 subjects, SD in 2 subjects, and PD in 
1 subject before treatment beyond progression was initiated. The number of doses received beyond 
progression ranged from 1 to 14 and the duration of treatment beyond progression ranged from 0.5 to 
6.4+ months. 
• 
PD-L1 status 
Of the 80 Cohort B subjects, 63 had quantifiable PD-L1 expression in R-S cells. Reasons for PD-L1 
expression not being quantifiable include the following: (1) sample not collected (n=3); (2) sample 
collected on study only (n=1), (3) not evaluable for R-S cells (n=10), and (4) R-S status not reported 
(n=3). Among 63 subjects with a quantifiable PD-L1 expression result, 57 (90.5%) had PD-L1 ≥1% 
expression using a 1% PD-L1 expression cutoff.

(QOL) and EORTC-QLQ-C30 (overall health status). Mean EQ-5D VAS scores increased over time. EORTC 
QLQ-C30 scores remained stable over time with mean changes from baseline trending towards an 
improvement on treatment across functional and symptom scales.  
•  Resolution of B-symptoms

Nivolumab treatment resulted in resolution of B-symptoms (median time to resolution of 1.9 months) in 
most (16/18, 88.9%) of the subjects with B-symptoms at baseline.

•  Next line systemic treatment post nivolumab for Cohort B (n=80) - as of 28-Jun-2016 
Information of the next line treatment post nivolumab therapy based on Oct-2015 DBL for the Study 
CA209205 for Cohort B was submitted. The next line systemic treatment post nivolumab therapy, as of 
28-Jun-2016, is presented below.  
Of the 80 subjects in Cohort B of CA209205, 3 7  (46.3 %) subjects are continuing nivolumab therapy, 43 
(53.8 %) discontinued nivolumab. Of the 43 subjects, 
  No subsequent therapy: n=23 
  Subsequent therapy: n=20 
  Subjects who had post-nivolumab allogeneic HSCT immediately after nivolumab discontinuation: 
n=8  
  Subjects who had next line systemic cancer treatments: n=12 (10 subjects who discontinue 
nivolumab due to disease progression and 2 subjects who discontinue nivolumab due to other 
reason, respectively). Of these, 3 subjects proceeded to allogeneic HCST after receiving systemic 
cancer treatments. The remaining 9 subjects did not receive allogeneic HCST.  
Thus, a total of 11 subjects from Cohort B, at the 28-Jun-2016 DBL had post-nivolumab allogeneic HSCT. 
Of these 11 subjects, 8 proceeded directly to allogeneic HSCT after nivolumab therapy, while 3 received 
next line treatment before allogeneic HSCT.  
In a post hoc analysis of the 80 patients in CA209205 Cohort B, it was found that 37 had no response to 
prior brentuximab vedotin treatment. Among these 37 patients, treatment with nivolumab resulted in an 
ORR of 59.5% (22/37). The median duration of response is 13.14 months (13.14, N.A.) for the 22 
responders to nivolumab who had failed to achieve response with prior brentuximab vedotin treatment. 
As of the 28-Jun- 2016 DBL, 3 out of 12 subjects in Cohort B who had next line systemic treatments 
died due to disease progression (these 3 subjects are among the 9 subjects who did not receive allogeneic 
HSCT). Death occurred on Days 284, 309, and 488 from the last dose of nivolumab in these 3 subjects. 
The median observation time after nivolumab exposure in the 9 subjects who are alive was 10 months 
(range: 4.3-16.0).  The subjects received their first subsequent systemic cancer therapy shortly after the 
discontinuation of nivolumab, with the median duration of 1.9 months (range: 0.4-7.0). After starting the 
first subsequent systemic cancer therapy, these subjects were followed up for a median duration of 8.4 
months (range: 2.6-15.6).

Supportive study(ies) 
Study CA209039 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, and multi-dose study of 
nivolumab as monotherapy and/or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab or lirilumab in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy, with expansion cohorts in selected hematologic 
malignancies including cHL. The primary objective of the study was to assess safety and tolerability in 
subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy after a minimum follow-up of 18 months. The study 
includes a nivolumab monotherapy portion. Subjects in the expansion cohorts received nivolumab at 3 
mg/kg at Week 1, Week 4, and then every 2 weeks until disease progression or CR or for a maximum of 
2 years 
• 
Patients 
While this study allowed enrollment for any type of HL including NLPHD, all Hodgkin subjects who enrolled 
in the nivolumab monotherapy cohort (n =23) had cHL. Subjects with prior allo-SCT transplant or 
autoimmune disorders were excluded. Of them, 15 subjects (referred as CA209039 ASCT-Bren Failed 
group) had analogous characteristics to CA209205 Cohort B. Data are based on the 19-Jun-2015 data 
cutoff after a minimum follow-up of approximately 18 months. 
• 
Endpoints 
The investigator-based efficacy endpoints are the primary efficacy endpoints (which was a secondary 
objective of the study), and the IRRC-based efficacy endpoints are the secondary efficacy endpoints. To 
assess the preliminary antitumor activity of nivolumab in cHL subjects, efficacy endpoints included 
objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), duration of 
CR, duration of PR, time to response (TTR), time to CR, time to PR and overall survival (OS). Importantly, 
investigator assessed BOR in CA209039 was defined as the best response designation over the study as 
a whole, recorded between the date of first dose and the last efficacy assessment prior to subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Therefore, BOR may have been identified based on response designations after 
investigator-assessed initial progression. 
Tumor assessments were performed radiographically and by FDG-PET scan at screening and 
on-treatment at 4, 8, 16, 24 and every 16 weeks thereafter. 
•  Baseline characteristics 
Among all cHL subjects, the median age was 35 years (range 20-54 years).The majority of all cHL 
subjects were white 20 (87%) non-hispanic or latino 19 (83%) subjects. There was a similar male to

female ratio: 12(52%) male and 11 (48%) female. All subjects had a baseline ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The 
most common site of lesions other than lymph nodes were lung (34.8%) and other sites included liver 
(13.0%) and kidney (4.3%). No subjects in the study had CNS disease. The median diameter and range 
(min-max) of tumour burden for all subjects was 1311.0 mm2 (180 - 14206 mm2). 
The median number of prior systemic regimens excluding preparative regimens for ASCT was 5 (range: 
2-15) in the ASCT-Bren Failed group.

Summary of key efficacy results per IRRC and per investigator all treated cHL 
subjects receiving monotherapy 
A total of 12 cHL subjects reported subsequent cancer therapy: 8 were from the cHL ASCT-Bren failed 
group and 4 from the cHL other group. The subsequent cancer therapies included radiotherapy, 
immunotherapy, chemotherapy, allo-SCT, ASCT, and steroid treatment. 6 subjects went on to SCT 
(allo-SCT n=5, ASCT n=1)- following a BOR of CR (n=1), PR (n=4) on study prior to transplant. 
Subjects were enrolled in this study regardless of PD-L1 expression status; however, pre-study (baseline) 
tumor tissue specimens were systematically collected prior to first treatment, in order to conduct 
pre-planned analyses of efficacy according to PD-L1 expression status. Ten subjects out of 23 had 
quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline. Among these 10 subjects, there were 9 subjects with ≥1% 
PD-L1 expression and 1 subject with <1% PDL1 expression. Out of the 9 subjects with ≥1% PD-L1 
expression, the ORR per investigator was 89% (8/9 subjects): 1 subject with CR, 7 subjects with PR and 
1 subject with SD. The 1 subject with <1% PD-L1 expression achieved a PR. 
• 
Efficacy in ASCT-naive Subjects 
Of the 23 subjects enrolled in the cHL expansion of CA209039 and treated with nivolumab (3 mg/kg 
Q2W), 5 were ASCT-naive. The efficacy observed in these ASCT-naive subjects was similar to that in cHL 
subjects after failure of ASCT and brentuximab. Of these 5 ASCT-naive subjects, 3 were 
brentuximab-naive and 2 had prior brentuximab. All subjects had at least 2 lines of prior systemic cancer 
therapy (median: 3; range: 3-8). Two of the 5 subjects had received prior brentuximab.

Two subjects, both responders, elected to discontinue nivolumab treatment and proceeded to subsequent 
transplant (Subject CA209039-5-57, ASCT; Subject CA209039-9-66, allogeneic SCT). 
Out of these 5 ASCT-naive subjects, 4 had an objective response both per IRRC and investigator, (Table 
26). Response occurred early during treatment (TTR range per IRRC: 0.7-1.6 months) and the DOR was 
long in 2 subjects (almost 2 years per IRRC).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A prospectively planned integrated analysis included a total of 95 cHL subjects from the 2 studies (80 
subjects from CA209205 and 15 subjects from CA209039) along with the data from individual studies. All 
95 subjects had prior brentuximab treatment after failure of ASCT and were treated with nivolumab 3 
mg/kg Q2W. The uniform pre-treatment history of subjects in the studies allowed integration of the 
efficacy data as assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC) using the 2007 revised 
International Working Group criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007 IWG criteria).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two ongoing clinical trials have been submitted to support this application: 
-  CA209205, is a Phase 2, open-label, non-comparative, multi-cohort, single arm study, 
investigating the activity of nivolumab monotherapy in cHL subjects 
-  CA209039 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, and multi-dose study of 
nivolumab as monotherapy and/or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab or lirilumab in 
subjects with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy, with expansion cohorts in selected 
hematologic malignancies including cHL 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 49/85 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The dosing is similar to other indications registered for nivolumab. 
Both studies are single arm, open label trials with different cohorts of patients. Overall, patients included 
in the analyses patients with relapse or refractory cHL after ASCT and brentuximab vedotin (cohort B 
study CA209205), patients that relapsed followed ASCT (brentuximab vedotin naïve; cohort A study 
CA209205), patients that relapsed after ASCT but were treated with brentuximab vedotin before and/or 
after ASCT (cohort C study CA209205) and finally, patients that were ASCT naïve (study CA209039). 
In cohort C, 57 out of 100 patients received ASCT followed by brentuximab. Overall, the baseline 
characteristics seem similar to the patients in cohort B, even though more patients in cohort B received 
5 or more previous systemic regimen (49% vs 29%). The median follow-up is almost 9 months (April 
2016 DBL). 
The data available for assessment included patients after failure of ASCT and brentuximab vedotin (80 
patients from cohort B in the study CA209205 along with 15 subjects from the study CA209039) and 100 
subjects from the cohort C (study CA209205). Data from cohorts A in the study CA209205 were not 
available. Only 5 patients ASCT naïve have been treated with nivolumab (study CA209039). In total, data 
from the 1st interim analysis at 6 months (DBL 20.10.15) and updated data with a 12 month minimum 
follow up were submitted (DBL 19.04.16). The studies are single arm trials with no comparator arm. The 
design of the trials are considered acceptable as classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare disease with an 
incidence of 1-5/10 000 and that the treatment is for a last line indication where patients have few 
remaining options. The endpoints (ORR, DOR, CR, PFS) are also considered relevant for this type of 
disease. There were no concerns raised with the conduct of the studies. The patients recruited in the 
cohort B represent a heavily pretreated population. The patients enrolled in the study are representative 
of the patient population that is seen in the clinic at this stage of the disease. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
With at least 12 months follow up, patients had a high rate of tumour responses with nivolumab (66% 
IRRC analysis, in the integrated population; n=95), although according to the IRRC review only 6.3% 
were complete responses. Duration of responses was found to be durable, with a median of 13.14 months 
in the integrated population. The values were lower with IRRC, however, the trend was similar. 
The median time to response was 2 months for study CA209205, whilst in study CA209039, the median 
was near one month. This could be due to the different time point of the first assessment (at week 4 
instead of at week 9 in the CA209205 study). 
The PFS results are still too immature to draw any conclusions. Preliminary PFS results show a median of 
14.78 months but the number of events is still low (38/95). In comparison, PFS data from the most recent 
prior systemic cancer therapy prior to the first dose of nivolumab in Study CA209205 showed a median 
PFS of 5.19 months (95% CI: 4.27, 7.59). 
OS data are also too immature to draw any firm conclusions. Among the patients who received 
subsequent anti-cancer treatment following nivolumab, 40 subjects underwent allo-SCT (35 subjects in 
study CA209205 and 5 in study CA209039) and only 1 subject (study CA209039) who underwent 
autologous SCT after discontinuation of nivolumab. Post-SCT efficacy data were currently available for 2 
subjects; investigator-assessed response at 100 days from transplant was CR in both subjects.  
Patients in cohort C that underwent ASCT followed by brentuximab showed similar results compared to 
cohort B where ORR was 72% with 12% of CR .Subgroup analysis of patients with treatment of 
brentuximab before ASCT or before and after ASCT also seem to offer similar results (assuming that the 
apparently better results in the “before and after” subgroup, could be overestimated due to the low 
number of patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 50/85 
 
  
  
The data seems consistent across the cohorts C and B and it is expected that the durable response 
observed will lead to a prolonged PFS and eventually a longer survival. The subgroups analyses are also 
consistent with the results from the whole studied population. Putting the efficacy of nivolumab into 
context, few efficacy alternatives are available after failure to ASCT and brentuximab. Retreatment with 
brentuximab vedotin could offer in patients with previous response to brentuximab (CR/PR) an ORR of 
around 60%, which could be considered similar to nivolumab. Nonetheless, these data come from only 20 
evaluable patients. The alternatives generally do not provide response rates above 30-40%. In fact, the 
ESMO guideline recommends the use of palliative single agent chemotherapy with gemcitabine or 
bendamustine and/or regional RT in patients with multiple relapses who have no other treatment options. 
There was some discordance between the IRRC and investigator assessment of endpoints. It is possible 
that the discordance in CRs was due mainly to different interpretation (positive or negative) of FDG-PET 
scans required for confirmation of a CR since the majority (13/19) of investigator-assessed CRs 
considered not CRs by IRRC were assessed as PRs by IRRC and also since tumour reductions were similar 
between IRRC and Investigators. This discordance in CRs is not considered to have a meaningful impact 
on the interpretation of the clinical results (SmPC section 5.1).   
Results according to PD-L1 expression (with a designated cutoff value of above or below 1%) do not show 
any meaningful differences. It is of note that 90% of the quantifiable population (63 subjects) had PD-L1 
≥1%.  
Eleven subjects who had progressed based on investigator assessment were considered eligible (per 
protocol) to receive continued nivolumab therapy. Tumour reduction continued over time in 8/11 subjects 
despite the appearances of new lesions in some cases. It is unclear whether there is a benefit of treatment 
continuation beyond progression. Currently the SmPC states that treatment duration of nivolumab should 
be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient. 
Cohort C in the pivotal study will provide initial data in cHL concerning whether discontinuation of 
nivolumab monotherapy is safe in patients who have remained in CR for one year on nivolumab. Some 
patients who have achieved CR may remain on study therapy indefinitely unless disease progression 
occurs. Therefore, the CHMP recommends the MAH to submit efficacy and safety data from study 
CA209205 cohort C in order to explore whether discontinuation of nivolumab monotherapy is safe in 
patients who have remained in CR for one year on nivolumab. 
The value of TILs, lymphocyte activation and proliferation markers have not been analysed in CA209039 
and CA209205 (all cohorts), and will not be further investigated because tumour tissue was exhausted for 
the studies. Details of the exploratory analysis of the tumour specimens from 45 patients from Study 
CA209205 were published in The Lancet Oncology (Younes et al, published online July 2016). According 
to this paper, in all evaluable biopsy specimens, Reed–Sternberg cells had PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene copy 
number alterations and copy-number-associated increased PD-L1 expression, which is consistent with 
previous studies on PD-L1 on RS cells. Patients whose RS cells had 9p24.1 amplification and increased 
PD-1 expression seemed more responsive to PD-L1 blockade; the association between best overall 
response and H score was significant (p=0,013). Nonetheless, most patients with 9p24.1 polysomy or 
PD-L1 expression in the first quartile achieved partial remission. Therefore, a clear relationship between 
9p24.1 polysomy or PD-L1 expression and efficacy of treatment cannot be made. The applicant is 
encouraged to aim at further studying the correlation of biomarkers with efficacy in further studies in 
order to better select the population that responds to treatment. Additional biomarker analyses may lead 
to improved understanding of the relationship between biomarkers and the efficacy of nivolumab in cHL. 
Additionally, secondary efficacy measures were resolution of B-symptoms and quality of life. The median 
time to B-symptom resolution was 1.9 months in most (16/18, 88.9%) of the subjects with B-symptoms 
at baseline (SmPC section 5.1). Mean EQ-5D VAS scores increased over time, but the EORTC-QLQ-C30 
scores remained stable over time. Importantly, no detrimental effects on QoL were observed.

EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 51/85 
 
  
  
For ASCT naïve subjects, data was only provided in a very limited number of subjects in study CA209039, 
which enrolled 5 ASCT-naive subjects that were heavily pre-treated with at least 2 lines of prior systemic 
cancer therapy. Of these 5 ASCT-naive subjects, 3 were brentuximab-naive and 2 had prior brentuximab. 
All subjects had at least 2 lines of prior systemic cancer therapy (median: 3; range: 3-8), 2/5 subjects 
had received prior brentuximab. The efficacy observed in these ASCT-naive subjects seems similar to that 
in cHL subjects after failure of ASCT and brentuximab (4 out of 5 had an objective response both per IRRC 
and investigator). Two subjects, both responders, elected to discontinue nivolumab treatment and 
proceeded to subsequent transplant. The CHMP considered that the claimed indication for the use of 
nivolumab in the treatment of an ASCT- naive cHL population prior to brentuximab was too broad in light 
of the limited evidence submitted. In particular, for patients who were not candidates for ASCT, there are 
other effective treatment options available and the data on nivolumab presented were too scarce to allow 
for a proper assessment of the benefit. Therefore, the indication was restricted to: “OPDIVO as 
monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with brentuximab vedotin.” 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Patients treated with nivolumab have shown to achieve a high ORR in a cHL population heavily 
pre-treated (after ASCT and brentuximab) who had exhausted effective available treatment options. The 
magnitude of the effect is clinically meaningful. This antitumor activity appears durable, which is expected 
to delay tumour progression and may potentially result in a prolonged survival benefit. In the setting of 
patients who are not candidates for ASCT and have other effective treatment options, the level of 
evidence with nivolumab in this patient population is too limited to draw any firm conclusions.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
•  Annex II condition Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): The MAH should submit the final 
clinical Study report for study CA209205: a Phase 2, non-comparative, multi-cohort, single-arm, 
open-label study of nivolumab (BMS-936558) in cHL subjects after failure of ASCT. The final 
clinical study report should be submitted by 30th June 2017 
The CHMP recommends the following measures to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
• 
The additional PD-L1 expression in R-S cells and 9p24.1 status in cHL patients treated with 
Opdivo from CheckMate CA209205 will be presented in an updated report. 
In order to explore whether discontinuation of nivolumab monotherapy is safe in patients who 
have remained in CR for one year on nivolumab, update data from Cohort C (study CA209205) 
should be submitted. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of nivolumab in cHL is based on safety data from the 2 ongoing studies (CA209205 and 
CA209039). Safety data from CA209205 (Cohort A+B+C; n= 240) and CA209039 (all cHL, n = 23) were 
integrated for analyses of safety in cHL (n = 263 subjects), this is the primary Integrated cHL 
population. The applicant has provided data from a database lock (DBL) of 09-Feb-2016 for the 
CA209205 study and 08-Feb-2016 for the CA209039 study (hereafter, 120-day SUR DBL). In 120-day 
SUR DBL, the number of the safety population increased from 263 to 266 because the last three subjects 
started the first dose of nivolumab after the cut-off date for DBL.  In addition, safety is presented for the 
population of all subjects analysed for efficacy. The Integrated Efficacy (SCE) Population was the 
Assessment report

population of 95 subjects who received brentuximab vedotin treatment following failure of ASCT (80 
subjects in CA209205 Cohort B + 15 subjects in CA209039).  
In addition to presenting safety data for the integrated cHL population, also presents safety data for the 
following smaller subgroups: 
•  CA209205 Cohort A+B+C: 243 subjects in 120-day SUR DBL 
-  Cohort A: 63 subjects with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) failure who have not received 
prior therapy with brentuximab vedotin 
-  Cohort B: 80 subjects who received brentuximab vedotin treatment following failure of ASCT, 
supporting the proposed indication 
-  Cohort C: 100 subjects (April 2016 DBL) adult patients with cHL failing ASCT who received prior 
treatment with brentuximab vedotin at any time (as initial therapy, salvage therapy before ASCT, 
and/or after ASCT [eg, salvage and maintenance therapy after ASCT]). 
•  CA209039 all cHL: n =23 subjects 
-  15  subjects  who  received  brentuximab  vedotin  treatment  following  failure  of  ASCT  (same 
population as Cohort B) 
-  8 subjects who had an alternative history of prior treatment 
o  5 ASCT-naive subjects (3 also naive to brentuximab vedotin) 
o  3  Other:  2  brentuximab  vedotin-naive  subjects;  1  subject  who  received  brentuximab 
before ASCT 
The population of ‘All SCS Subjects’ was defined as all CA209205 (Cohort A+B+C) and CA209039 cHL 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of nivolumab monotherapy. 
Safety data were further integrated across studies in multiple indications using the approved dosage and 
administration of nivolumab monotherapy. The 9 studies included in the analyses for nivolumab 
monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W) were CA209205 (Cohort A+B+C) and CA209039 (all cHL) in cHL, 
CA209025 in RCC, CA209037, CA209066, and CA209067 (monotherapy arm) in melanoma, CA209063, 
CA209017, and CA209057 in NSCLC. 
Patient exposure 
In the safety database, the majority of cHL subjects (76.7%) received ≥90% of the planned nivolumab 
dose intensity, the median number of nivolumab doses received was 16 (Table 28).

In CA209205 Cohort B, frequencies of all-causality AEs (any grade and Grade 3-4) were slightly higher 
than in the Integrated cHL Population, consistent with the longer duration of exposure and follow up in 
CA209205 Cohort B. 
Drug-related Adverse Events 
The frequency, type, and severity of drug-related AEs as assessed by the investigator (any grade and 
grade 3-4) are shown in Table 31. 
•  Drug-related AEs of any grade were reported in 77.1% of subjects. The most frequently reported 
drug-related AEs (≥10% of subjects) were fatigue (19.9%), infusion-related reaction (12.8%), 
diarrhea (13.5%), nausea (10.2%), and rash 12.0%). 
•  Drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 19.5% of subjects. The most frequently reported 
Grade  3-4  drug-related  AEs  (≥1%  of  subjects)  were  lipase  increased  (3.8%),  ALT  increased 
(2.3%), AST (1.5%), amylase increased (1.5%) and neutropenia (2.3%).

Select Adverse Events 
Endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently 
considered to be select AEs. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions are also considered AEs of special clinical 
interest that are potentially associated with the use of nivolumab. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions 
were analysed along with the select AE.

Endocrine Events 
Endocrine selected AEs (all causality, any grade) were reported in 16.2% of subjects. The majority of 
endocrine select AEs were considered drug-related by the investigator. For the 31 subjects (11.7%) with 
drug-related endocrine select AEs, all events were thyroid disorders, with hypothyroidism and primary 
hypothyroidism as the most frequently reported terms (> 2% of subjects). All events were Grade 1-2.

Skin Events 
The frequency of skin select AEs (all causality, any grade) was 33.8%. The majority of skin select AEs 
were considered drug-related by the investigator. For the 56 subjects (21.1%) with drug-related skin 
select AEs, rash, pruritus, and rash maculo-papular were the most frequently reported terms. The 
majority of events were Grade 1-2. Grade 3 events were reported in 3 subjects (rash in 2 subjects, rash 
maculo-papular in 1 subject). The incidence of immune-related rash has been updated and is depicted as 
selected adverse reaction in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8.

Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions 
The frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (all causality, any grade) were 16.9%. The majority 
of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were considered drug-related by the investigator. The most 
frequently reported events were infusion-related reactions (13.2%, 35/45 subjects). The majority of 
events were Grade 1-2. Two Grade 3-4 events were reported (infusion related reaction and 
hypersensitivity). No Grade 5 events were reported. The incidence of infusion reactions has been updated

There were 6 subjects that had OESIs (3 with pancreatitis, 3 with a uveitis event [2 uveitis, 1 iritis], and 
1 with encephalitis). One subject had a Grade 3 SAE of encephalitis, which was not treated with 
immune-modulating medication and was not considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Increased lipase level (any Grade or Grade 3/4) as an AE of abnormal investigation was higher frequency 
in the Integrated cHL Population than the Pooled Population of the subjects who were treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy. However, not all nivolumab monotherapy Phase 2 and 3 studies systematically 
monitored lipase test. Thus, an estimate of the frequency of asymptomatic lipase/amylase elevations is 
unknown.  
Increased lipase as AE (any grade) was reported more frequently in cHL subjects than in the pooled 
nivolumab safety population (6.8% versus 3.1% and drug-related 4.9% versus 2.1%). Approximately 
50% was grade 3-4 in both populations.

However, not all nivolumab monotherapy Phase 2 and 3 studies systematically monitored lipase. 
Pancreatitis was reported in 2 subjects in the cHL integrated population and 10 subjects in the pooled 
population, with a similar incidence (0.8% versus 0.5%). Lipase increase and pancreatitis are reported in 
the SmPC section 4.8. 
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome 
Another event of special interest first observed in RCC Study CA209025 was systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome. In the Integrated cHL Population, no events of systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome were reported. 
Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was identified as an event of special interest based on 3 cases with fatal 
outcome identified in ongoing studies in the nivolumab program (1 case occurred on nivolumab 
monotherapy; 1 case occurred on subsequent Bactrim after discontinuation from nivolumab and

ipilimumab [1 dose] due to ulcerative colitis; 1 case occurred on subsequent ipilimumab after 
discontinuation from nivolumab due to erythema multiforme). 
In the Integrated cHL Population, no events of TEN were reported. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The frequency, type, and severity of drug-related SAEs (any grade and Grade 3-4) are reported in Table 
48.

•  Drug-related  SAEs  of  any  grade  were  reported  in  10.2%  of  subjects.  The  most  frequently 
reported  drug-related  SAEs  (≥1%  of  subjects)  were  infusion-related  reaction  (1.9%)  and 
pneumonitis (1.1%).

•  Drug-related Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 4.9% of subjects.  
Deaths  
A total of 18 subjects (6.8%) died (Table 49). 3.4% of the death was due to disease progression and one 
death (within 30 days of last dose) was attributed to a reason of “study drug toxicity “grade 5 SAE 
atypical pneumonia), this was changed by the investigator to unrelated post database lock. One subject 
whose death was attributed to disease progression had a Grade 5 drug-related SAE of dyspnea 2 days 
prior to his death. Eight deaths (3.0%) were attributed to a reason of “other”. One death (within 30 days 
of last dose) was attributed to a reason of “unknown” (subject was lost to follow up).  
Table 49: 
Death Summary - All SCS Subjects and SCE Subjects – 120 Day Safety Update 
In the SCE Subjects (cohort B + 15 patients from CA209039), 3 deaths were attributed to a reason of 
“other”, 1 from CA209205 study and 2 from the 15 subjects of CA209039 study who received 
brentuximab vedotin treatment following failure of ASCT. The one subject in study CA2090205 was found 
to have died from Epstein Barr virus (EBV) positive peripheral T cell lymphoma which was deemed 
unrelated to study drug. The 2 deaths from study CA209039 were related to GVHD and complications 
associated with allo-SCT 224 days after the last dose of nivolumab. 
Laboratory findings (Integrated cHL Population) 
The incidence of laboratory abnormalities has been updated and is depicted as selected adverse reaction 
in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Hematology 
The majority of subjects did not have on-study worsening in hematology, the majority of hematology 
laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1-2. The only Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormality reported in ≥ 5% 
of subjects was decreased absolute lymphocytes (8.3%). Treated subjects (n = 263) who experienced a 
≥2-grade shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality were as follows: 3 (1.1%) subjects 
with decreased hemoglobin (Grade 3), 5 (1.9%) subjects with decreased platelet count (3 Grade 3, 2 
Grade 4), seven (2.7%) subjects with decreased leukocytes (6 Grade 3, 1 Grade 4), 5 (1.9%) subjects

with decreased lymphocytes (4 Grade 3, 1 Grade 4), 9 (3.4%) subjects with decreased absolute 
neutrophil count (6 Grade 3, 3 Grade 4).

Liver Function Tests 
The majority of subjects did not have on-study worsening in liver function tests. Most abnormalities in 
liver function were Grade 1-2. Grade 3-4 increases in the following liver function tests occurred in ≥ 2% 
of subjects: AST (2.4%) and ALT (2.0%). The number of treated subjects (n = 263) who experienced a 
≥2-grade shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was low: 2 (0.8%) subjects for ALP 
increased (Grade 3), 6 (2.3%) subjects for AST increased (5 Grade 3, 1 Grade 4), 4 (1.5%) subjects for 
ALT increased (3 Grade 3, 1 Grade 4), 1 (0.4%) subject for total bilirubin increased (Grade 3), 3/255 
(1.2%) subjects had concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3 x ULN with concurrent (within 1 day) total 
bilirubin > 2 x ULN. 
In CA209205 and CA209039, 3 subjects met the protocol-specified criteria for drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI; concurrent [within 1 day] ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 100 days of the 
last dose of nivolumab). 
Kidney Function Tests 
The majority of subjects had normal serum creatinine values during the reporting period; serum 
creatinine that worsened relative to baseline (any grade) was reported in 10.3% of subjects. There were 
no Grade 3-4 abnormalities in serum creatinine. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
The majority of subjects had normal TSH levels at baseline and throughout the treatment period. 16.3% 
of subjects had elevated on-study TSH (> ULN) with normal baseline TSH (≤ ULN). 5.9% of subjects had 
low on-study TSH (< LLN) with normal baseline TSH (≥ LLN). 
Safety in special populations 
In the Integrated cHL Population, the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs for subgroups of 
gender, race, age, and region were similar to the AE frequencies in the overall treated population.  
In the integrated cHL cohort only 7 subjects were ≥65 years. The limited experience with elderly has 
updated the SmPC (SmPC section 4.8 and 5.1).

Subjects receiving subsequent stem cell transplantation (SCT) 
Information on the updated outcome of 17 subjects having post-nivolumab allogenic SCT was reported. 
Out of 266 cHL subjects who were treated with nivolumab monotherapy (an additional 7 subjects since 
the database lock for the SCS (10 subjects, 5 subjects in a Phase 1 (CA209039) and 2 (CA209205) trial, 
respectively).  
The median age at HSCT was 33 (range: 18 - 56). Most subjects received a non-myeloablative regimen 
prior to SCT (15 of the 17 subjects). A median of 9 doses (range 4-16) nivolumab were administered prior 
to allo-SCT with a time from last nivolumab dose to SCT ranging from 11 to 94 days. Acute GvHD was 
reported in 14 subjects, of which 5 patients with grade 3-4. Six out of the 17 subjects died from 
complications post nivolumab alloSCT. Two subjects experienced hyperacute graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD), defined as occurring within the first 14 days after stem cell infusion. Two subjects experienced 
encephalitis (1 case of grade 3 lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause and 1 case 
of grade 3 suspected viral encephalitis). One subject was reported with hepatic veno-occlusive disease 
(sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) who received reduced-intensity conditioning and died due to 
multiorgan GVHD. From the updated safety data, an additional 23 subjects receiving alloSCT after 
nivolumab were submitted. In the 23 new cases only 2 subjects developed a grade 3- 4 GvHD, while of 
the previous 17 subjects 5 patients developed a grade 3- 4 GvHD. There were no cases of treatment 
related mortality (TRM) among the 23 newly reported patients, leaving the total number of TRM events at 
6.

A multivariate analysis for transplant related death was performed applying a standard Cox PH model to 
study the effects of the covariates. Again, since all the deaths are transplant-related mortality (TRM) and 
no progression dates were collected after allogeneic HSCT for the 40 subjects, the competing risk model 
was not used.

The incidence and grade of acute GVHD reported from the 40 subjects are described in Table 53. Two 
subjects experienced hyperacute GVHD, defined as occurring within the first 14 days after stem cell 
infusion. For this analysis, subjects with unknown grade of acute GVHD were imputed to Grade 4. In the 
40 subjects who received allogeneic HSCT after nivolumab from CA209039 and CA209205, the overall 
frequencies of Grade 2-4 and Grade 3-4 acute GVHD was 32.5% and 17.5%. As cited in literature7, the 
frequency of moderate to severe acute GVHD was approximately 40% of all recipients of allogeneic HSCT.

Incidence and grade of acute GVHD in the 40 subjects who received allogeneic 
HSCT after nivolumab treatment at any timepoint after allogeneic HSCT 
Grade 2-4 Acute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT 
Cumulative incidence rate of Grade 2-4 acute GVHD from subsequent allogeneic HSCT was calculated 
using Kaplan-Meier method. The cumulative incidence rate of Grade 2-4 acute GVHD (95% CI) at Day 
100,  6  months,  and  1  year  are  34.2 %  (20.5,  53.4),  41.5 %  (24.7,  63.7)  and  51.2 %  (30.3,  76.1), 
respectively.

A multivariate analysis for Grade 2-4 acute GVHD was performed applying a standard Cox PH model to 
study the effects of the covariates. The number of prior systemic cancer therapy prior to nivolumab was 
associated with an increased risk for Grade 2-4 acute GVHD. Subjects with more prior systemic cancer 
therapies (i.e. more advanced) were more likely to experience acute GVHD. No association with Grade 
2-4  acute  GVHD  was  detected  for  time  from  last  dose  of  nivolumab  to  allogeneic  HSCT,  number  of 
nivolumab doses received, and age at allogeneic HSCT was not associate. The non-significance of these 
covariates may be due to a small sample size and small number of events. 
Grade 3-4 Acute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT 
Cumulative incidence rate of Grade 3-4 acute GVHD from subsequent allogeneic HSCT was calculated in 
the same method as for Grade 2 -4 acute GVHD. 
There is one subject who had a death without Grades 3-4 acute GVHD. The cumulative incidence rate of 
Grade 3-4 acute GVHD (95% CI) at Day 100, 6 months, and 1 year are 19.0 % (9.0, 37.6), 25.7 % (12.4, 
48.7) and 44.3 % (18.5, 81.2), respectively (Figure 11). 
The median time from transplant to Grade 3-4 acute GVHD (including two subjects with unknown grade 
of acute GVHD) cannot be estimated due to the small number of the subjects (n=7). The range of the 
onset of Grade 3-4 acute GVHD in 5 subjects (all Grade 4) was 14-43 days from transplant date. The 
onset  of  acute  GVHD  in  the  2  subjects  with  unknown  grades  of  acute  GVHD  was  22  and  162  days, 
respectively, from transplant date.

HSCT. 
•  Chronic GVHD was reported in 2 subjects; both are limited stage of chronic GVHD. 
•  Steroid-responsive febrile syndrome, defined as fever (which may have been accompanied by skin, 
joint, or liver symptoms) without infection, which responded to steroids, was reported for 6 subjects. 
•  Two subjects experienced encephalitis: 1 case of grade 3 lymphocytic encephalitis which occurred and 
resolved on corticosteroids, and 1 case of grade 3 suspected viral encephalitis which resolved with 
antiviral therapy. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Dose Delays and Interruptions 
The majority of subjects received all doses of nivolumab without any infusion interruptions (95.1%) or 
dose delays (62.4%). Infusion interruptions were reported for 4.9% (n=13) of subjects. Of the doses 
interrupted (15/3140, 0.5%), 53.3% (8/15) were interrupted due to a hypersensitivity reaction.  
Dose delays were reported for 37.6% of subjects, dose delays due to AEs were reported for 3.3% 
(96/2877) of all doses received. 98,4% of the delays were restarted within 42 days (47,2% within 4-7 
days).

Immunogenicity 
In study CA209205, there was 1/159 (0.6%) subject who was ADA positive and who was not considered 
persistent positive or neutralizing ADA positive. The highest titer value observed in this ADA-positive 
subject was 4. Of the 159 subjects with a baseline and least 1 post-baseline ADA measurement, 26 
subjects experienced select AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category and all were ADA 
negative.  
In study CA209039, there was 1/19 (5.3%) subject who was ADA positive and who was not considered 
persistent positive or neutralizing ADA positive. The highest titer value observed in this ADA-positive 
subject was 32. Of the 19 subjects with a baseline and least 1 post-baseline ADA measurement, a total of 
4 subjects experienced select AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category and all were ADA 
negative.  
An integrated analysis of nivolumab immunogenicity assessments was performed with data across 
indications from subjects treated with 3 mg/kg Q2W nivolumab (Studies CA209037, CA209063, 
CA209066, CA209017, CA209057, CA209067 [nivolumab monotherapy arm only]), CA209025, 
CA209205, and CA209039. Of 1586 subjects who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
evaluable for the presence of ADA, 157 subjects (9.9%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA. 
Only 2 subjects (0.1% of the total) were persistent positive, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 
only 9 (0.6% of the total) of the ADA positive subjects. There were no acute infusion reactions, 
hypersensitivity events, or new or additional AEs observed in patients with neutralizing antibodies.

Post marketing experience 
Nivolumab was first approved on 04-Jul-2014 in Japan for unresectable melanoma and has since been 
approved across multiple countries, including the US and the EU, and for other indications (eg, metastatic 
NSCLC, advanced RCC). Based on routine pharmacovigilance activities conducted by the MAH 
Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, review of postmarketing data confirms the clinical trial data for 
nivolumab. To date, no new significant safety concerns have been identified based on the global 
postmarketing reports. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of nivolumab monotherapy was assessed primarily based on the data from the integrated CHL 
population  (CA209205  cohort  A+B+C  (n=240)  and  CA209039  all  cHL  (n=23  subjects).  The  median 
extent  of  follow-up  was  prolonged  from  5.55  months  to  9.49  months,  the  median  number  of  doses 
received  increased  from  10.0  to  16.0,  and  the  number  of  the  subjects  who  had  at  least  12  months 
follow-up has been changed from 10 to 88.The safety data from the separate studies were in line with the 
data  from  integrated  analysis.  The  frequencies  of  immune-related  pneumonitis,  colitis,  hepatitis, 
nephritis and renal dysfunction, endocrinopathies, rash, infusion reactions, laboratory abnormalities and 
immunogenicity have been updated in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Patients with active autoimmune disease and symptomatic interstitial lung disease were excluded from 
clinical trials of cHL, thus a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In the absence of data, 
nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential 
risk-benefit on an individual basis. 
All-causality AEs and drug-related AEs were slightly higher in cohort B study CA209205 which is likely due 
to the longer exposure duration and follow-up. In general, the types and frequencies of AEs were 
consistent with prior nivolumab experience from other indications. In the 120-day safety update, the 
majority of subjects (76.5%) received ≥90% of the planned nivolumab dose intensity, the median 
number of nivolumab doses received was 16.  
All-causality AEs of any grade were reported in 98.1% of subjects. The most frequently reported AEs 
(≥20% of subjects) were fatigue (32.3%), diarrhoea (28.9%), pyrexia (27.1%) and cough (25.9%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 73/85 
 
  
  
 
Drug-related  AEs  of  any  grade  were  reported  in  77.1%  of  subjects.  The  most  frequently  reported 
drug-related AEs (≥10% of subjects) were fatigue (19.9%), infusion-related reaction (12.8%), diarrhoea 
(13.5%), nausea (10.2%), and rash (12.0%). 
All-causality Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 35.0% of subjects. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 
AEs  (≥2%  of  subjects)  were  lipase  increased  (4.9%),  neutropenia  (3.0%),  alanine  aminotransferase 
increased (2.6%) and anaemia (2.3%).  
Drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 19.5% of subjects. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 
drug-related AEs (≥ 1% of subjects) were lipase increased (3.8%), ALT increased (2.3%), neutropenia 
(2.3%), amylase increased (1.5%) and AST (1.5%). 
Increased  lipase  as  AE  (any  grade)  was  reported  more  frequently  in  cHL  subjects  than  in  the  pooled 
nivolumab safety population (6.8% versus 3.1% and drug-related 4.9% versus 2.1%). Approximately 
50%  was  grade  3-4  in  both  populations.  The  reported  higher  frequency  of  increased  lipase  in  cHL 
population was possibly due to systematic monitoring of serum lipase in the Phase 1 (CA209039) and 
Phase 2 (CA209205) studies. 
Pancreatitis was reported in 2 subjects in the cHL integrated population and 10 subjects in the pooled 
population, with a similar incidence (0.8% versus 0.5%). Lipase increase and pancreatitis are reported in 
the SmPC section 4.8.  
The  increased  frequency  of  neutropenia  is  likely  attributed  to  the  cHL  patient  population  since  the 
majority of subjects had previous exposure to high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT.  
Among the most frequently reported AEs pyrexia was reported more frequently (> 5% difference) in cHL 
than in RCC, melanoma, and NSCLC, this could be attributed to the underlying disease. 
All-causality SAEs of any grade were reported in 23.3% of subjects. The most frequently reported SAEs 
(≥1% of subjects) were infusion-related reaction (1.9%), pneumonia (1.9%), pleural effusion (1.5%), 
pyrexia (1.5%), malignant neoplasm progression (1.5%), dyspnoea (1.1%) and pneumonitis (1.1%). 
Drug-related  SAEs  of  any  grade  were  reported  in  10.2%  of  subjects.  The  most  frequently  reported 
drug-related SAEs (≥1% of subjects) were infusion-related reaction (1.9%) and pneumonitis (1.1%) 
All-causality Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 15.4% of subjects. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 
SAEs (≥1% of subjects) were pneumonia (1.1%), dyspnoea (1.1%) and malignant neoplasm progression 
(1.1%). 
Drug-related Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 4.9% of subjects.  
The frequencies of Select AEs (endocrine, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and dermatological 
events) showed similar frequencies as other indications.  
A higher incidence of drug-related infusion reactions was observed in cHL versus other tumour types, this 
is likely due to a high rate of reporting at one single site. The infusion-related reactions were reported at 
higher frequencies in cHL (13.2%) compared with other tumour types: RCC (5.2%), melanoma (4.8%), 
and NSCLC (2.2%). In the Integrated cHL Population -120-day safety update, the frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (all causality, any grade) was 16.9%. Therefore, these 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions are not considered significantly clinically relevant to nivolumab 
treatment.  
In the integrated analysis, 18 subjects (6.8%) died, 3.4% of the death was due to disease progression 
and one death (within 30 days of last dose) was attributed to a reason of “study drug toxicity”, eight 
deaths (3.0%) were attributed to a reason of “other” and 0.4% due to study drug toxicities.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 74/85 
 
  
  
Interpretation of the frequencies in the ≥65 years age group is limited for the total nivolumab 
monotherapy group due to the small number of subjects. In the integrated cHL cohort only 7 subjects 
were ≥65 years. The limited experience with elderly has been reflected in the SmPC. 
There was am increase in number of cases with (moderate and severe) acute GvHD (87%), and alloSCT 
associated death observed after nivolumab treatment which is of concern since it exceeds the percentage 
of similar cases published in the literature (which has been reported close to 40%). The MOA as well as 
limited published non-clinical and clinical studies suggest a relation between nivolumab and aGVHD. It is 
notable that among the new cases reported in the safety update, there was a remarkable lower incidence 
of acute GVHD and TRM. When comparing the median observation time after alloSCT, i.e. 308 days for 
the initial 17 subjects and 41 days for the additional 23 subjects, the shorter follow-up in the additionally 
reported patients is likely the most important factor contributing to the lower incidence rates for aGvHD 
and TRM. Multivariate analysis results showed that for both aGvHD and OS, no relevant association 
between transplant procedures and nivolumab treatment could be found. However, patient number is 
small and the patient population is very heterogeneous, particular regarding follow-up duration. Based on 
these data, a relationship between an increased risk for aGvHD and TRM following alloSCT after previous 
exposure to nivolumab cannot be excluded. Therefore, acute GvHD has been included as an important 
potential safety concern in the RMP and will be managed through routine pharmacovigilance (warning in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC) and additional risk minimisation activities with updated educational material. In 
addition, the CHMP has requested for the MAH to perform a registry study in patients who underwent 
post-nivolumab allogenic HSCT. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety of nivolumab monotherapy in cHL appears to be consistent with the safety in approved 
indications. In heavily pretreated cHL patients who received prior ASCT and brentuximab vedotin, the 
safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy was consistent with the Integrated cHL Population, with higher 
AE frequencies. The SmPC has been updated with the pooled frequencies for the adverse reactions. No 
new safety concerns have been raised except for the increased risk for acute GvHD and TRM following 
alloSCT after nivolumab exposure (see RMP). Because of the limited data available, it is not possible to 
exclude  causality  between  aGvHD  and  nivolumab  following  alloSCT.  Therefore,  complications  of 
allogeneic HSCT following nivolumab therapy has been included as an important potential risk and risk 
minimisation measures will be put in place. There are few data on the safety of elderly patients with cHL 
≥ 65 years of age, which has been include as missing information in the RMP. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
PASS: A registry study in patients who underwent post-nivolumab allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) should be carried out.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
The application for an extension of indication in cHL is based on the clinical data derived from two ongoing 
single arm, open label studies, the phase II study CA209205 (in patients having progressed after ASCT 
with different cohorts having received or not brentuximab vedotin) and phase I study CA209039 (with 
expansion cohorts studying different types of hematologic malignancies patients). Overall, patients 
relapse or refractory after ASCT and brentuximab vedotin (cohort B study CA209205), patients having 
progressed after ASCT but not treated with brentuximab vedotin (brentuximab naïve; cohort A study 
CA209205), patients having progressed after ASCT but treated with brentuximab before and/or after 
ASCT (cohort C study CA209205) and finally, patients not eligible for ASCT (ASCT naïve:; study 
CA209039) have been included in the analyses. 
Beneficial effects 
•  Nivolumab treatment after ASCT and treatment with brentuximab vedotin 
In the integrated population (n=90) from study CA209205 (n=80) (cohort B) and CA209039 (n=15), 
treatment of patients with nivolumab led to an ORR of 66.3% (IRRC analysis) with a CR of 6.3% and 
median DOR of 13.14 months. Data from cohort C in patients with the same previous sequence of 
treatment than in the cohort B (n=57) are consistent with the efficacy showed in the integrated 
population. The efficacy results from this cohort look similar to cohort B, ORR was 72% (vs 66.3% in 
cohort B Oct 2015 DBL) with 12% of CR (vs 9% CR in cohort B). Median time to reach a response was 2 
months, according to the phase II trial results, and almost 1 month when the phase I study is observed 
but the difference could just be due to differences in the time point for assessment within studies (at week 
4 in the phase I instead of week 9 in the CA209205 study). 
Regarding the subgroups analyses (by age, gender, race, region, smoking status, B-symptoms at initial 
diagnosis, baseline ECOG performance status, time from initial diagnosis to first transplant, time from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/741329/2016 
Page 78/85 
 
  
  
 
recent transplant to first subsequent therapy, and number of prior lines of cancer therapy excluding 
preparative regimens) the results are in line with those of the whole study population, even when the 
previous response to brentuximab is included in the analysis.  
Analysis of biomarkers such as 9p24.1 showed that patients with 9p24.1 amplification and increased PD-1 
expression seemed more responsive to PD-L1 blockade; the association between best overall response 
and H score was significant (p=0.013). 
This antitumor activity appears to translate into a delay in the tumour progression, with a median PFS of 
14.78 months. However, the number of events is still low (38/95 in the integrated population) and there 
is no OS data.  
•  Nivolumab treatment after at least 2 prior therapies in patients who are not candidates for ASCT 
Study CA209039 enrolled 5 ASCT-naive subjects (3 were brentuximab-naive and 2 had prior brentuximab 
treatment) that were heavily pre-treated with at least 2 lines of prior systemic cancer therapy. Four out 
of five ASCT naive subjects had an objective response both per IRRC and investigator. Two subjects, both 
responders, were elected to discontinue nivolumab treatment and preceded to subsequent transplant. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In patients heavily pre-treated (ASCT and brentuximab), mature PFS and OS data are still unavailable. 
Therefore, the CHMP has requested the MAH to submit PFS and OS data from study CA209205 as part of 
an Annex II condition. 
Results from PD-L1 expression according to the pre-specified cutoff of 1%, do not show meaningful 
differences, although 90% of the quantifiable population (63 subjects) had PD-L1 ≥1%.  
The value of TILs, lymphocyte activation and proliferation markers have not been analysed in CA209039 
and CA209205 (all cohorts). Analysis of patients with 9p24.1 polysomy or PD-L1 expression showed that 
in the first quartile were able to achieve partial remission and as such a clear relation between 9p24.1 
polysomy or PD-L1 expression and efficacy of treatment can currently not be made. At this stage the 
number of biopsies is small and analyses seem exploratory. The applicant is encouraged to aim at further 
studying the correlation of biomarkers with efficacy in further studies. Additional biomarker analyses may 
lead to improved understanding of biomarkers and the efficacy of nivolumab in cHL. Therefore, the CHMP 
recommends for the MAH to pursue biomarker analysis in the context of cHL. 
In ASCT-naive subjects with a median of 2 prior treatments, although efficacy was shown in 4/5 subjects, 
the sample size was too limited for any meaningful conclusion and comparative data to a brentuximab 
vedotin treatment arm was lacking. The CHMP had concerns that there were too few data to support an 
expanded indication in patients that were ASCT- naïve at this time considering that there are currently 
other effective treatment options for this patient population. 
It  is  unknown  whether  discontinuation  of  nivolumab  monotherapy  is  safe  in  patients  who  have 
discontinued and remained in CR for one year on nivolumab. Currently the SmPC states that treatment 
duration of nivolumab should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no 
longer tolerated by the patient. For cHL, this would mean that some patients who have achieved CR may 
remain on therapy for a prolonged period of time until disease progression occurs. Therefore, the CHMP 
recommends  the  MAH  to  submit  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  study  CA209205  cohort  C  in  order  to 
explore whether discontinuation of nivolumab monotherapy is safe in patients who have remained in CR 
for one year on nivolumab.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  nivolumab  monotherapy  was  assessed  primarily  based  on  the  data  from  the 
integrated CHL population (CA209205 cohort A+B+C (n=240) and CA209039 all cHL (n=23 subjects). 
Drug-related  AEs  of  any  grade  were  reported  in  77.1%  of  subjects.  The  most  frequently  reported 
drug-related AEs (≥10% of subjects) were fatigue (19.9%), infusion-related reaction (12.8%), diarrhoea 
(13.5%), nausea (10.2%), and rash (12.0%). Drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 19.5% of 
subjects.  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AEs  (≥  1%  of  subjects)  were  lipase 
increased  (3.8%),  ALT  increased  (2.3%),  neutropenia  (2.3%),  amylase  increased  (1.5%)  and  AST 
(1.5%). Lipase increased and neutropenia were the only Grade 3-4 AE reported more frequently (>1% 
difference) in cHL than in the other tumour types.  
In the integrated cHL Population (120-day safety update), there was a low frequency of AEs leading to 
discontinuation  (5.3%  of  subjects).  Drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  any  grade  were 
reported in 4.1% of subjects. Drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 
3.4% of subjects.  
In the integrated analysis (120-day Safety update), 18 subjects (6.8%) died. 3.4% of the death was due 
to disease progression and one death (within 30 days of last dose) and 0.4% due to study drug toxicities. 
Eight deaths (3.0%) were attributed to a reason of “other” and not thought to be related to the treatment. 
The  immunogenic  potential  of  nivolumab  monotherapy  is  low  (0,6%  in  CA209205  and  5,3%  in 
CA209039). The incidence of infusion-related reactions is numerically higher in the cHL population than in 
the  nivolumab  monotherapy  treatment  group.  Delayed  hypersensitivity  can  be  observed  beyond  6 
months 
from 
the 
first  dose  of  nivolumab  at  a  very 
low 
frequency.  Therefore, 
these 
hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  are  not  considered  significantly  clinically  relevant  to  nivolumab 
treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Fatal events have occurred in patients who received allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-SCT) after 
nivolumab  and  there  were  a  higher  than  expected  number  of  patients  who  suffered  aGvHD  and  TRM 
compared to historical controls. The data is still preliminary and further follow up of patients undergoing 
allogeneic  HSCT  after  previous  exposure  to  nivolumab  would  be  needed  to  ascertain  this  risk. 
Nevertheless,  complications  of  allogeneic  HSCT  following  nivolumab  therapy  has  been  included  as  an 
important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  will  be  monitored  through  routine  pharmacovigilance  (SmPC 
section 4.4). Additional risk minimisation activities have been included with an update to the educational 
material  on  the  risk  of  complications  of  allogenic  HSCT  following  nivolumab  therapy.  In  addition,  the 
CHMP  has  requested  the  MAH  to  follow  up  patients  who  underwent  post-nivolumab  allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in a registry study. 
Interpretation  of  the  frequencies  in  the  ≥ 65  years  age  group  is  limited  for  the  total  nivolumab 
monotherapy group due to the small number of subjects. The limited experience with elderly has been 
reflected in the updated SmPC and added to the RMP as missing information.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The treatment of cHL patients with nivolumab showed an ORR with a high order of magnitude which in 
itself is considered clinically meaningful. In the group of patients heavily pretreated (after ASCT and 
brentuximab) and with limited treatment options available, tumour responses following treatment with 
nivolumab are considered clinically relevant. In addition, support for this outcome is observed in the 
prolonged durability of the responses. It is realistic to assume that the delay in tumour progression will 
result in a higher PFS and longer OS in the long term. This is supported by the analysis from the most 
recent prior systemic cancer therapy in Study CA209205 and comparing those to the median PFS offered 
by nivolumab (14.78 months vs 5.19 months). 
From a safety point of view, data are limited but so far no unexpected AEs have been identified. 
Nonetheless, the potential complications (acute GvHD and TRM) in patients pretreated with nivolumab 
and then with alloScT are uncertain, since the patient number is small and the patient population is very 
heterogenous, especially regarding follow-up duration. This will be follow up by routine and additional 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Hodgkin Lymphoma is a potentially curable disease in patients at first line, with a cure rate of 
approximately 80% with the use of modern therapies.  For patients who relapse, treatment of choice 
consists of a chemotherapy regimen (different than that used in the first line) followed by high dose 
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy. Once a subject 
undergoes ASCT and subsequently relapses, the outcomes are generally poor and efficacious therapeutic 
options are limited. The median OS of patients who relapse after ASCT was initially reported to be < 1 
year; more recent data suggests that the median OS is evolving and may be closer to 2 years because of 
the availability of newer therapies like brentuximab. 
Data from the clinical development of nivolumab in cHL come from two small open label single arm 
studies. In spite of the uncertainties generated by the lack of control group, the tumour response rates 
achieved with nivolumab in a heavily pre-treated population (including ASCT and brentuximab, with a 
median of number of prior systemic regimens excluding preparative regimen of 4) are considered 
outstanding. Few efficacy alternatives are available after failure to ASCT and brentuximab vedotin. 
Retreatment with brentuximab vedotin in those patients with a previous response to brentuximab 
(CR/PR) appears to show an ORRs around 60%8, which could be considered similar to nivolumab. The rest 
of alternatives can hardly provide response rates above 30-40%. In fact, the ESMO guideline 
recommends the use of palliative single agent chemotherapy with gemcitabine or bendamustine and/or 
regional RT in patients with multiple relapses who have no other treatment options. 
It is clear that in a relapse/refractory population heavily pre-treated with ASCT and brentuximab, the 
treatment with nivolumab is able to provide high and durable tumour responses. This improvement in 
antitumour activity is expected to translate into a clinical benefit in terms of PFS and OS, however, the 
data are immature at this stage to draw any conclusions. As a follow up, the CHMP has request the MAH 
to submit PFS and OS data from study CA209205. 
It is of note that a higher than expected number of cases with (moderate and severe) acute GvHD, and 
alloSCT-related deaths occurred after nivolumab treatment. As nivolumab releases the regulatory breaks

that keep the immune system under control, the relationship between nivolumab and aGVHD cannot be 
ruled out. According to the current guidelines, as alloSCT is currently not the preferred approach in the 
post- autoSCT setting, nivolumab use prior to alloSCT does not result in a loss of chance per se. The 
decision of treating patients with nivolumab following alloAST should be taken following careful 
consideration to the potential benefits of SCT and the possible increased risk of transplant related 
complications. This decision should be made on a case by case. Close monitoring of patients undergoing 
alloSCT for hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), grade 3-4 acute GVHD, steroid requiring 
febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and other transplant related complications is 
recommended.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy and safety: 
•  Annex II condition Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): The MAH should submit the final 
clinical Study report for study CA209205: a Phase 2, non-comparative, multi-cohort, single-arm, 
open-label study of nivolumab (BMS-936558) in cHL subjects after failure of ASCT. The final 
clinical study report should be submitted by 30th June 2017 
• 
PASS: A registry study in patients who underwent post-nivolumab allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) should be carried out. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
Type II 
I, II, IIIA and 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one  
IIIB 
Extension of Indication to include the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to add 
the proposed new indication, add a warning that patients with active autoimmune disease and 
symptomatic interstitial lung disease were excluded from clinical trials of cHL, and update the safety and 
pharmacodynamic information. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is 
brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. Moreover, the updated RMP version 5.3 was 
agreed during the procedure. 
This recommendation is subject to the following amended condition: 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to launch of OPDIVO in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media,

distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed at increasing the awareness about the potential immune mediated 
adverse events associated with OPDIVO use, how to manage them and to enhance the awareness of 
patients or their caregivers on the signs and symptoms relevant to the early those adverse events. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where OPDIVO is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe and use OPDIVO have access to/are 
provided with the following educational package: 
• 
• 
Physician educational material 
Patient alert card 
The physician educational material should contain: 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  Adverse Reaction Management Guide 
The Adverse Reaction Management Guide shall contain the following key elements: 
•  Relevant information (e.g. seriousness, severity, frequency, time to onset, reversibility of the AE 
as applicable) for the following safety concerns: 
•  Immune-related pneumonitis 
•  Immune-related colitis 
•  Immune-related hepatitis 
•  Immune-related nephritis or renal dysfunction 
•  Immune-related endocrinopathies  
•  Immune related rash 
•  Other immune-related ARs 
• Potential risk of ‘Complications including acute graft-versus-host-disease and transplant 
related mortality of allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant following nivolumab 
therapy’ 
•  Details on how to minimise the safety concern through appropriate monitoring and management 
•  The patient alert card shall contain the following key messages:  
• 
That OPDIVO  treatment may increase the risk of:  
•

Update of sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the paediatric information based on 
results from phase II dose finding study NH 19707 (Dolphin): An Open-Label, Multi-Center, Multiple Dose 
Study to Determine the Optimum Starting Dose of Intravenous Mircera for Maintenance Treatment of 
Anemia in Paediatric Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Hemodialysis; listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH has provided the results of a standalone Dolphin study (NH19707) concerning PK in children to 
support the proposed amendments to the product information, sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2. This study is 
part of the PIP which also includes two additional studies (i.e. NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies) and 
whose data are pending. The first one (NH19708) is a phase 2 study designed to ascertain the starting 
dose of Mircera given subcutaneously to paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on 
dyalisis when switching from epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa. The second one is a 
population PK/PD model including adult data from previous studies and children data from NH19707 and 
NH19708 studies. 
Considering that there are some uncertainties about efficacy results from study NH19707 and also that 
the results of NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies are pending, for the time being changes to sections 4.2, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC including paediatric information are not recommended. In addition, according to 
the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics only evidence from relevant studies supporting the 
indication should be included in this section. The current indication is limited to adults so the inclusion of 
data on children in section 5.1 is not supported at this stage.  
According to the data provided in this variation procedure the benefit-risk balance of Mircera remains 
positive in the currently authorised conditions for use, which is limited to the adult population. No 
changes to the SmPc are recommended for the time being.

5.  Introduction 
Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease and anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in 
children 
Chronic Kidney Disease in Children 
Childhood chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents clinical features that are specific and totally particular to 
the  paediatric  age  group,  such  as  the  impact  of  the  disease on  growth.  In  addition,  some of  the  typical 
characteristics  of  paediatric  CKD,  such  as  the  etiology  or  cardiovascular  complications,  represent 
variables,  not  only  influencing  the  health  of  the  patient  during  childhood,  but  also  having  an  impact  on 
the life of the adult that this child will become (Becherucci et al 2016). 
Data  on  the  epidemiology  of  CKD  in  children  who  are  on  dialysis  is  available  from  the  North  American 
Paediatric  Renal  Trials  and  Collaborative  Studies  (NAPRTCS)  and  the  United  States  Renal  Data  System 
(USRDS).  Information regarding paediatric patients who receive maintenance  hemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis has been captured since 1992. Children with CKD represent a very small percentage of the total 
CKD population (NAPRTCS 2014 Annual Report and USRDS 2016 Annual Report). 
The 2014 NAPRTCS registry spans more than 25 years and has collected information on the transplants of 
over  11,186  children.  As  of  January  1,  2014  (data  base  closure  for  the  2014  report),  12,189  renal 
transplants  had  been  reported  for  11,186  paediatric  patients.  This  represents  586  new  transplants  and 
554 patients with their first registry transplant since the 2010 Annual Report. 
In  2014,  the  total  number  of  children  in  the  United  States  who  had  not  yet  received  a  primary  kidney 
transplant  and  were  on  maintenance  dialysis  was  7045  (NAPRTCS  2014  Annual  Report).  However, 
twenty-five  percent  of  primary  transplants  were  preemptive,  as  these  patients  had  never  received 
maintenance dialysis. 
Of the 9,721 children included in the USRDS report (USRDS 2016 Annual Report), adolescents and young 
adults between the ages of 0 and 21 years with prevalent end stage renal disease (ESRD) as of December 
31,  2014,  kidney  transplant  was  the  most  common  treatment  modality  (6825  [70.2%]),  followed  by 
hemodialysis  (1745  [18.0%])  and  peritoneal  dialysis  (1122  [11.5%]).  Over  80%  of  prevalent  children 
ages  5-13  years  have  a  kidney  transplant.  This  equates  to  a  point  prevalence  per  million  population  of 
18.5 for hemodialysis, 11.7 for peritoneal dialysis, and 69.8 for transplant. 
Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease in Children 
Anemia is a major consequence of CKD. Similar to adults, many paediatric patients with CKD suffer from 
normocytic,  normochromic  anemia.  Erythropoietin  deficiency  is  the  main  cause  of  anemia  in  these 
patients.  The  symptoms  associated  with  anemia  include  fatigue,  decreased  exercise  tolerance,  cardiac 
dysfunction  and  impaired  cognitive  function.  Anemia  also  results  in  increased  risk  of  development  of 
cardiovascular disease and increased mortality (Foley et al 1996). The mechanism of anemia due to CKD 
in children is identical to that in adults.

Current Treatment Options 
Exogenous replacement of erythropoietin by erythropoietic agents is an established method for treatment 
of anemia in CKD. This therapy can be divided into two phases: the initial correction phase, during which 
hemoglobin  (Hb)  levels  rise  and  reach  plateau  levels,  and  the  subsequent  maintenance  phase  during 
which plateau levels are maintained by regular erythropoietin administration. 
Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are approved treatments in the US for anemia associated with CKD in 
paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa is indicated in patients aged 1 month to 16 years of age for the treatment 
of  anemia  associated  with  CKD  requiring  dialysis  (US  Package  Insert,  Epogen  2014).  As  noted  in  the 
product labelling, the safety profile of epoetin alfa in paediatric patients on dialysis appears to be similar 
to that of adults.  
In Europe epoetin alfa and beta are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with 
chronic renal failure (CRF): 
- in adults and children aged 1 to 18 years on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis. 
-  in  adults  with  renal  insufficiency  not  yet  undergoing  dialysis  for  the  treatment  of  severe  anaemia  of 
renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms. 
Darbepoetin  alfa  is  indicated  for  the  correction  and  maintenance  treatment  of  anemia  associated  with 
CKD  in  paediatric  patients  (1-<  18  years  of  age)  on  dialysis  and  patients  not  on  dialysis  (US  Package 
Insert, Aranesp 2016). The darbepoetin alfa labeling states that safety and efficacy were similar between 
adults and paediatric patients with CKD when darbepoetin alfa was used for initial treatment of anemia or 
patients were transitioned from treatment with epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa. The long-term safety and 
efficacy of darbepoetin were assessed in a prospective registry study of 319 patients treated for up to 2 
years (Schaefer et al 2015). No new safety signals were found for darbepoetin treatment and anemia was 
effectively managed in these patients. 
In Europe darbepoetin alfa has the same indication approved in US. 
These  approved  erythropoietic  agents  are  administered  by  intravenous  (IV)  or  subcutaneous  (SC) 
injection  either  three  times  a  week  (epoetin  alfa)  or  once  a  week  or  once  every  2  weeks  (darbepoetin 
alfa), with the IV route being recommended for patients on dialysis. 
Background of Mircera 
Physical and Chemical Characteristics 
Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera) is a chemically synthesized continuous erythropoietin 
receptor  activator.  Mircera  differs  from  erythropoietin  (EPO)  through  integration  of  an  amide  bond 
between  an  amino  group  and  methoxy  polyethylene  glycol-butanoic  acid.  This  results  in  a  molecular 
weight  of  ~60  kDa.  In  contrast  with  EPO,  Mircera  shows  different  activity  at  the  receptor  level 
characterized by a slower association to the receptor, reduced specific activity in vitro with an increased 
activity in vivo, as well as an increased half-life. These Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycolepoetin beta) 
pharmacological properties allow longer (once-monthly, 1x/month) dosing intervals. 
Mircera Clinical Development in Adults

Mircera  was  first  approved  in  2007.  It  is  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  symptomatic  anemia 
associated  with  CKD  in  adult  patients,  including  those  on  dialysis  and  those  not  on  dialysis,  in  115 
countries worldwide. 
The global clinical development program for Mircera included 13 Phase I clinical pharmacology studies in 
499  healthy  volunteers  and  24  patients  with  CKD  not  yet  on  dialysis  and  16  patients  with  CKD  on 
peritoneal dialysis, and 10 therapeutic studies comprising four Phase II and six Phase III studies in a total 
of  1789  patients  with  CKD,  including  patients  on  dialysis  and  not  on  dialysis  (Figure  below).  Three 
additional Phase III studies were completed post-approval (NH20052, BH17847, BH20051). 
Figure. Mircera Clinical Development Program – Renal Anemia 
Rationale for Paediatric Use of Mircera and Clinical Development in Paediatric Patients 
The  MAH  is  developing  Mircera  for  maintenance  treatment  of  anemia  associated  with  CKD  in  paediatric 
patients  switching  from  a  stable  dose  of  another  ESA  to  Mircera.  The  Mircera  clinical  development 
program  in  paediatric  patients  comprises  2  studies.  The  Phase  II,  single-arm  study  NH19707,  now 
completed  and  object  of  the  present  variation  procedure,  assessed  IV  administration  of  Mircera  every  4 
weeks in the maintenance setting in paediatric patients aged 5-17 years on hemodialysis after switching 
from another ESA. A second paediatric study of SC administration of Mircera every 4 weeks is planned in 
children  either  on  dialysis  (hemodialysis  or  peritoneal  dialysis)  or  not  yet  on  dialysis,  also  in  the 
maintenance setting (Study NH19708). 
Regulatory background 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019 
Page 8/57 
  
  
 
The  approval  of  Mircera  in  July  2007  included  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  as  post  approval 
commitment. In February 2009 the PDCO and MAH agreed to a PIP which consisted of the following two 
studies: 
Phase II study NH19707 with primary objectives 
•  To  determine  the  starting  dose  of  intravenous  (iv)  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on 
hemodialysis  when  switching  from  stable  maintenance  treatment  with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or 
darbepoetin alfa, 
• To demonstrate changes in hemoglobin (Hb) over time in response to different iv doses of Mircera. 
Phase III study NH19708 with primary objective: 
•  To  confirm  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  (sc  administration)  selected  in  the  previous  exploratory  dose-
finding study, in a larger group of paediatric patients with CKD on dialysis and not yet on dialysis. 
The Phase II study (NH19707, also known as ‘DOLPHIN’) is completed. The CSR was submitted to EMA on 
July 2016 (seq.0106) and the CHMP concluded the review in December 2016. The primary objectives of 
this  study  were  to  determine  the  starting  dose  of  MIRCERA  in  paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on 
hemodialysis  when  switching  from  stable  maintenance  treatment  with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or 
darbepoetin alfa and to demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different iv doses of Mircera 
in paediatric patients (5<18 years) whose hemoglobin has been stabilized with previous ESA treatment. 
The  MAH  has  also  performed  a  model-based  evaluation,  integrating  data  from  both  adults  and  children 
followed by model based simulations.  
Since the first PIP approval in 2009, knowledge of Mircera has been extended through clinical trials and 
global  exposure  in  adults  of  approximately  1.9  million  patient-years.  Consequently  and  in  addition  to 
paediatric  data  generated  by  study  NH19707,  real-world  paediatric  data  are  available  from  the 
International Paediatric Dialysis Network and two independent publications on paediatric use. 
Based  on  above  the  MAH  considered  the  originally  committed  Phase  III  randomized,  controlled  parallel 
group clinical trial involving 150 children is no longer justifiable. Therefore, in September 2016, the MAH 
submitted  a  PIP  modification  proposing  the  replacement  of  the  current  approved  Phase  III  study  with  a 
second  Phase  II  study  (using  the  same  study  number  NH19708)  of  25  evaluable  patients  to  address 
outstanding  questions  not  addressed  in  study  NH19707  (i.e.  administration  in  younger  children,  sc 
administration of Mircera and its use in pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis). The proposed study also aims 
to  confirm  the  conversion  factor  when  switching  from  stable  subcutaneous  maintenance  treatment  with 
epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa, and also to provide clinical evidence for the starting dose of 
Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  CKD  paediatric  patients  determined  in  NH19707.  The  request  for 
modification  procedure  included  an  oral  explanation.  The  PDCO  concluded  in  the  final  opinion  dated 
February 2017, that the concept of the proposed modifications to study NH19708 would be agreeable, but 
with  some  additional  amendments  to  the  PIP  such  as  number  of  patients,  further  modelling  and 
simulation evaluations, design features of the clinical study (interim analysis, inclusion of a youngest age 
subset, sampling scheme, 6 month safety follow-up) and assessment of the possible risks of polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) accumulation. 
A  modified  PIP,  addressing  PDCO  concerns,  for  study  NH19708  was  submitted  in  June  2017  and  PDCO 
positive opinion was received on 15th of September 2017.

1.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
1.1.  Methods – validation of assay for measurement of ADA and NADA 
Analytical methods 
Report No. 1046298: RO0503821 (CERA): Validation of Assay for Measurement of Anti-EPO (ADA) in 
Human Serum (YBS Study YCM/010). 
The  study  has  been  validated  and  subject  to  inspection/audit  by  the    independent  Quality  Assurance 
personnel  at  York  Bioanalytical  Solutions  (YBS)  in  accordance  with  YBS  standard  operating  procedures 
(September 28, 2010). 
The presence of anti-EPO  antibodies is determined using a bridging ELISA format, including streptavidin 
coated  microtitre  plates,  biotin  labelled  EPO,  digoxigenylated  EPO  and  anti-digoxigenin  Fab  fragments 
conjugated to HRP. 
The  sensitivity of  the  assay  was  8.87  ng/mL.  The  low  and  high  positive  controls  were  determined:  14.6 
and 369 ng/mL, respectively. Although there is no criteria stated in the Study Plan, the inter- and intra-
assay precision were determined. Neither significant matrix effects nor positional effects were observed. A 
confirmatory cut point was statistically established. 
Report No. 1046299: RO0503821 (CERA): Validation of Assay for Measurement of Anti- RO0503821 
(ADA) in Human Serum (YBS Study YCM/009). 
The  study  has  been  validated  and  subject  to  inspection/audit  by  the    independent  Quality  Assurance 
personnel  at  York  Bioanalytical  Solutions  (YBS)  in  accordance  with  YBS  standard  operating  procedures 
(September 27, 2010). 
The  presence  of  anti-  RO0503821  antibodies  is  determined  using  a  bridging  ELISA  format,  including 
streptavidin  coated  microtitre  plates,  biotin  labelled  RO0503821,  digoxigenylated  RO0503821  and  anti-
digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated to HRP. 
The  sensitivity of  the  assay  was  57.5  ng/mL.  The  low  and  high  positive  controls  were  determined:  0.21 
and 5.54 
g / m L,   r e s
statistically established. The inter- and intra-assay  precision were determined. Neither significant matrix 
effects nor positional effects were observed. A confirmatory cut point was statistically established. 
Report  No.  1054621:  RO0503821  (Mircera):  Validation  of  Assay  for  Measurement  of  RO0503821  in 
Human Serum (YBS Study YCM/013, including Addendum I). 
The study has been subject to inspection/audit by the  independent Quality Assurance personnel at York 
Bioanalytical  Solutions  (YBS)  in  accordance  with  YBS  standard  operating  procedures  (November  16, 
2015). 
The  objective  of  the  last  study  was  to  assess  the  long  term  stability  of  RO0503821  when  spiked  into 
human serum and stored at -20°C. Stability was established for 16 months. 
The presence of RO0503821 is determined using a Sponsor’s ELISA method, including streptavidin coated 
microtitre  plates,  biotin  labelled  anti-EPO  antibodies  and  goat  anti-mouse  IgM  conjugated  to  HRP.  The 
analytical  method  has  been  validated  successfully  over  the  concentration  range  150  to  4000  pg/mL 
(January  8,  2013),  demonstrating  sufficient  accuracy,  precision  and  reliability.  The  method  was  not

significantly  affected  by  lipaemia  or  haemolysis.  There  is  no  interference  to  the  analytical  method  for 
RO0503821 from EPO up to 6400 pg/mL of EPO. 
The  inter-  and  intra-assay  precision  was  determined.  During  cross  validation  it  was  shown  that  the 
method is affected by inter-individual variability (matrix effect). The method has been successfully cross 
validated.  Human  serum  Hu/S/X/09/702e  or  equivalent  serum  must  be  used  as  the  blank  matrix  in 
simple analysis studies to eliminate potential bias due to the matrix effect. 
Report  No.  1062976:  Validation  of  a  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  and  confirmation  of 
neutralizing antibodies against Mircera in human serum samples. 
The  assay  has  been  validated  on  November  27,  2014.  This  direct  NAb  assay  is  based  on  growth 
stimulation  of  AS-E2  cells  (expressing  human  low  affinity  EPO  receptor)  induced  by  Mircera  followed  by 
the  measurement  of  ATP  using  the  CeiiTiter  Glo®  ATP  luminescence  assay.  In  the  presence  of 
neutralizing  anti-Mircera  antibodies,  growth  stimulation  is  diminished  or  stopped,  depending  on  the 
antibody concentration. 
The sensitivity of the method is 630 ng/ml positive control in pool matrix. The determined inter and intra-
assay precision was found to be below 17 % CV. No significant impact on the assay results by position of 
sample on the assay plate was observed. The assay is robust regarding cell passage numbers from 2 up 
to  20  and  assay  time  between  94  and  98  h.  All  haemolysed  samples  produced  positive  signals  in  the 
Mircera  Nab  assay.  Therefore,  analysis  of  haemolysed  samples  should  be  avoided.  To  discriminate  false 
positive  from  true  positive  samples  a  Confirmation  Assay  using  an  alternative  stimulus  has  been 
established. 
This cell based assay method has been shown to be sufficiently precise, accurate, selective and sensitive 
for  the  determination  of  neutralizing  antibodies  against  Mircera  in  human  serum  samples  at 
concentrations higher than 1200 ng/ml of positive control neutralizing antibody against Mircera. However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019

it  has  to  be  noted that  the  assay  shows  severe  interference  at  drug  levels  above  6.25  ng/ml Mircera  at 
HPC 1200 ng/ml. 
Report  No.  1062977:  Validation  of  a  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  and  confirmation  of 
neutralizing antibodies against EPO in human serum samples. 
The assay has been validated on November 4, 2014. This direct NAb assay is based on growth stimulation 
of  AS-E2  cells  (expressing  human  low  affinity  EPO  receptor)  induced  by  Erythropoeitin  followed  by  the 
measurement  of  ATP  using  the  CeiiTiter  Glo®  ATP  luminescence  assay.  In  the  presence  of  neutralizing 
anti-EPO  antibodies,  growth  stimulation  is  diminished  or  stopped,  depending  on  the  antibody 
concentration. 
The  sensitivity  of  the  method  is  121  ng/mL  positive  control  antibody.  The  determined  inter-  and  intra-
assay precision was found to be below 19 % CV. No significant impact on the assay results by position of 
sample on the assay plate was observed. The assay is robust regarding cell passage numbers from 2 up 
to 20 and assay time between 94 and 98 h. All hemolyzed samples produce positive signals in EPO Nab 
assay.  Therefore,  analysis  of  hemolyzed  samples  should  be  avoided.  Lipemic  samples  lead  to  false 
positive  signals  in  20  %  of  samples  tested.  To  discriminate  false  positive  from  true  positive  samples  a 
Confirmation Assay using an alternative stimulus has been established. 
This cell based assay method has been shown to be sufficiently precise, accurate, selective and sensitive 
for  the  determination  of  neutralizing  antibodies  against  EPO  in  human  serum  samples  at  concentrations 
higher than 200 ng/ml of positive control neutralizing antibody against EPO. However, it has to be noted 
that the assay shows severe interference at drug levels above 6.25 ng/mL Mircera at HPC 400 ng/mL.

1.4.  Clinical pharmacology 
Methods and results 
The PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis included in this application were performed on data from a total 
of 587 patients; 524 Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycolepoetin beta) adults and 63 paediatric patients. 
The data from paediatric patients used in these two population analyses are from study NH19707.  
Prior to the conduct of study NH19707, no data were available on the clinical pharmacology of Mircera in 
paediatric  patients.  Study  NH19707  aimed  to  determine  the  starting  dose  of  intravenous  Mircera  in 
paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on  hemodialysis  when  switching  from  stable  maintenance  treatment  with 
epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa and to demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to 
different doses of Mircera. The study also aimed to evaluate the PK of Mircera in paediatric patients. 
Overview of Study Design 
Mircera was administered once every 4 weeks IV for 20 weeks in paediatric patients with CKD receiving 
hemodialysis  who  switched  from  other  ESAs  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa).  An  optional  safety 
extension period included up to an additional year of treatment for stable patients, however PK samples 
were  only  collected  during  the  core  study  period.  After  the  first  administration  of  Mircera,  dose 
adjustments were permitted at every dose (once every 4 weeks) to maintain target Hb levels, which were 
measured  once  a  week  during  the  core  study  period  and  once  every  four  weeks  during  the  safety 
extension. The protocol foresaw different groups with different conversion factors related to their previous 
ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose. The first group comprised patients who started with 
an  intermediate  conversion  factor  dose  (Group  1  hereinafter).  In  the  adaptive  design,  this  conversion 
factor  proved  inadequate  and  a  second  group  (Group  2)  was  enrolled  for  treatment  with  a  higher 
conversion factor dose, double that of Group 1. 
Dosing Rationale 
The conversion factors tested in Group 1 were directly derived from experience in adults receiving Mircera 
intravenously  and  from  the  results  of  a  published  study  of  darbepoetin  alfa  conducted  in  paediatric 
patients (Warady et al 2006). As the patients included in this study were already on stable maintenance 
doses  of  an  ESA  prior  to  conversion  to  Mircera,  and  assuming  a  linear  relationship  across  dose  ranges, 
the use of a conversion factor resulted in a Mircera dose that was proportional to the previous ESA dose, 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019 
Page 13/57 
  
  
the latter being adjusted according to body weight; thus the starting Mircera dose indirectly accounted for 
weight-adjusted  dose  requirements  in  paediatric  patients.  As  noted  above,  the  adaptive  design  allowed 
for a second group to test a higher or lower conversion factor according to findings in Group 1. 
The  conversion  factors  tested  are  shown  in  tables  1a  and  1b  (conversion  from  epoetin  alfa  or  beta  and 
conversion from darbepoetin alfa).

The  clinical  pharmacology  data  from  NH19707  were  analyzed  using  two  different  approaches,  a  non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis and a model-based analysis of PK and PD data. 
Sampling Schedule in Study NH19707 
At Week 9, after 3 doses of Mircera, 3 samples were collected: the first sample before dosing, the second 
sample 2 hours after dosing, and the third sample 48 hours after dosing. At 12 other time-points, a single 
sample was collected (week 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 and 20).  
Results from the Non-Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Analysis:

Twelve patients in Group 1 and 34 patients in Group 2 had sufficient PK data available at Week 9 to be 
included in the non-compartmental PK analysis. The PK parameters at Week 9 are summarized by group 
in  Table  2.  At  Week  9,  maximum  serum  drug  concentration  was  observed  at  2.0  hours.  The  mean 
apparent  terminal  half-life  of  elimination  calculated  from  non-compartmental  analysis  methods  was 
approximately 121−147 hours (geometric mean), which is similar to values reported in adults (134 hours 
in adult CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis). The highest exposure was observed as expected in Group 2, 
with a geometric mean Cmax of 66100 pg/mL and a geometric mean AUC0-tau of 7170000 pg • hr/mL.

COMPARISON AND ANALYSES OF RESULTS ACROSS STUDIES 
Model-based evaluation and simulation (including data from study NH19707 and several studies in adults) 
were  performed  to  support  the  characterization  of  clinical  pharmacology  following  intravenous 
administration of Mircera to paediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years. 
A  model-based  approach  has  been  used  throughout  Mircera  clinical  development.  Population  PK  and 
PK/PD models were initially developed based on adult Phase III data to support drug approval in adults. 
When  the  results  from  study  NH19707  became  available,  models  were  re-evaluated  by  incorporating 
paediatric data.  
NH19707  data  were  pooled  with  adult  Phase  II  and  Phase  III  data.  The  pooled  PK  and  PK/PD  analyses 
allow a comparison between adult and paediatric data using a single analysis. The PK and PK/PD analyses 
were  performed  on  587  patients:  524  adults  and  63  children  aged  from  6  to  <18  years  with  at  least  1 
determination of Mircera concentration. Paediatric patients were on hemodialysis and received Mircera IV. 
The majority of adult patients (n=407) were on hemodialysis. Fewer patients were on peritoneal dialysis 
or not on dialysis (n=52 and 65, respectively). Adult patients received Mircera IV or SC. The population

PK  and  PK/PD  analyses  aimed  to  assess  the  PK  and  PD  properties  of  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  and 
whether these properties differ from those in adults. 
The  results  from  the  pooled  population  PK  and  PK/PD  analyses  and  impact  on  Mircera  development  in 
paediatric drug development are summarized below: 
Pharmacokinetic Findings 
•  The  same  structural  PK  model  as  in  the  previous  analysis  based  on  Phase  III  data  only,  i.e.  1-
compartment  model  with  first  order  absorption  and  elimination  processes,  was  used  to  describe  the 
paediatric data. 
• The estimated clearance was 0.74 L/day and the volume of distribution 3.5 L. The estimated clearance 
with this model was similar to the estimated clearance based on modelling of Phase III adult data (0.75 
L/day) whereas the estimated volume was lower than in the previous model (4.7 L). 
• Positive body-weight effects on clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V), and positive age effect on 
V  were  confirmed,  relationships  were  consistent  across  the  full  age  and  body weight  ranges  (see  Figure 
below). 
Figure 1. Relationships between PK Parameters and Covariates: Age and Body Weight 
Black dots: adult data; red dots: paediatric data (NH19707); blue line: model prediction. 
• Once those covariate effects were taken into account, no difference in PK between adult and paediatric 
patients could be observed: age and body weight capture the differences between both populations (see 
figure below).

(ETA.V) in Adult and Paediatric Populations 
Comparable Mircera exposure was observed in both populations at the end of the evaluation period. 
PK/PD Findings 
•  The  population  PK/PD  model  developed  with  Phase  III  data  could  be  applied  to  the  pooled  data 
including the data from study NH19707. 
•  No  difference  in  Mircera  dependent  PK/PD  parameters  was  observed  between  paediatric  and  adult 
patients showing that the Mircera exposure response relationship is similar in both populations (see figure 
below). 
Figure  3.  Distribution  of  Random  Effect  for  Drug-Dependent  PK/PD  Parameters  in  Adult  and 
Paediatric Populations 
Smax: maximum increase in Hb production rate relative to baseline production rate; SC50: concentration 
of Mircera at which 50% of the maximum increase is achieved. 
•  A positive body weight effect was found on the PK/PD model parameter representing the theoretical 
Hb value at baseline prior any ESA treatment (Hb0). This effect is driven by the paediatric population 
and seems to be in accordance with generally higher Hb levels observed in adults. 
•  A  positive  effect  of  previous  ESA  dose  on  SC50,  PK/PD  model  parameter  representing  the  Mircera 
concentration  at  which  50%  of  the  maximum  increase  is  achieved.  Indeed  patients  receiving  higher

ESA  dose  before  switching  to  Mircera  require  higher  concentration  of  Mircera to  achieve 50%  of  the 
maximum increase. 
•  Higher inter-individual variability in PK/PD parameters i.e. 222% coefficient of variation (CV) on SC50 
compared to PK parameters 45% CV on CL.  
The  clinical  impact  of  the  body  weight  and  age  effects  on  PK  parameters  is  marginal  because  the 
variability in PK/PD is much higher than PK variability. The main covariate effect, considered by the MAH, 
explaining variability in Hb response is the previous ESA dose. This justifies the current practice to use a 
conversion  factor  based  on  the  previous  ESA  dose  when  switching  to  Mircera.  As  previous  ESA  dose  is 
body-weight  adjusted,  body  weight  is  indirectly  taken  into  account  in  the  Mircera  dose.  The  high  inter-
patient variability in Mircera PK/PD parameters also justifies the current clinical practice of adjustment of 
Mircera doses based on monitoring of Hb levels during treatment. 
Immunogenicity Results in Study NH19707 
In study NH19707, blood samples to measure anti-erythropoietin antibodies and antidrug antibodies were 
collected on day 1 (before the first drug administration), at week 13 and at final visit of the Core period, 
and at final visit of the safety extension period.  
No  patients  tested  positive  for  erythropoietin  antibodies  or  anti-drug  antibodies  at  any  time  during  the 
study,  including  the  safety  extension  period.  For  this  reason,  there  is  no  information  about  correlation 
between immunogenicity and PK, PD, safety or efficacy. 
Rapporteur's discussion 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  is  based  on  data  from  study  NH19707  and  it 
was  analyzed  using  two  different  approaches,  a  non-compartmental  pharmacokinetic  analysis  and  a 
model-based analysis of PK and PD data. 
The NH19707 study is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study to determine the optimum 
starting dose of Mircera in children aged 5-17 years old receiving hemodialysis who switched from other 
ESAs  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa).  Two  groups  using  different  conversion  factors  related  to 
their previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose were included. The first one comprised 
patients who started with an intermediate conversion factor dose (Group 1). In the adaptive design, this 
conversion  factor  proved  to  be  inadequate  and  a  second  group  (Group  2)  was  enrolled  using  a  higher 
conversion factor dose, double that of Group 1. 
In this study, PK analysis was done with data from 12 out of 16 and 34 out of 48 patients from group 1 
and  2  respectively.  Patients  included  were  from  5 to  18  years of  age  which  does  not  allow  drawing  any 
conclusions regarding patients younger than 5 years. Due to fact that the MAH did not provide the age of 
patients  included  for  PK  analysis  it  is  not  possible  to  know  if  PK  samples  obtained  are  enough  to 
characterize  PK  profile  in  all  age  groups  (i.e  children  and  adolescents)  of  the  paediatric  population.  In 
order  to  ascertain  the  starting  dose  of  Mircera  in  children  from  3  months  to  18  years  old  the  amended 
agreed  PIP  included  a  new  study  (NH19708).  A  population  PK  will  also  be  conducted  with  pooled  data 
from  the  former  study  and  existing  PK/PD  models  previously  developed  in  adults  and  children  (study 
NH19707). When the whole data are available, the comparison with the adult data and a depth discussion 
of the results, instead of a crude data presentation, will be helpful to describe PK profile in children and 
establishing the correct posology in this population.

Samples were obtained at Week 9, after 3 doses of Mircera. At this point 3 samples were collected: the 
first sample before dosing, the second sample 2 hours after dosing, and the third sample 48 hours after 
dosing. At 12 other time-points, a single sample was collected (week 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 
19  and  20).  These  samples  provided  PK  parameters  of  Mircera  with  a  serum  geometric  mean  Cmax  of 
66.1  ng/mL,  a  geometric  mean  AUC0-tau  of  7170  ng.hr/mL  and  an  apparent  mean  half-life  of 
approximately  121  hours,  based  on  conversion  factor  established  for  group  2.  However,  it  should  be 
taken  into  account  that  there  are  doubts  about  whether  the  selection  of  this  conversion  factor  is 
appropriate (see efficacy discussion).  
The  MAH  also  conducted  a  pop-PK/PD  analysis  with  data  from  NH19707  study  in  children  and  adult  
phase II and phase III data whose results have not been presented in this variation. These results will be 
completed  by  the  ones of  the  ongoing  studies included  in  the  agreed  PIP  (i.e NH19708  and  a  new  pop-
PK/PD  analysis).    Specifically  these  studies  will  provide  data  on  posology  and  definitive  PK  data  in 
patients from 3 months of age and older as well as information about the subcutaneous administration of 
Mircera. In the Rapporteur's view, the entire PK data package in children should be assessed as a whole 
once the results of all the studies are available.  
The MAH is proposing to include some PK data in children in section 5.2 of the SmPC based on partial PK 
data. Since relevant studies are still ongoing and that their results will be key to have a complete picture 
of  the  Mircera  PK  profile  in  children,  the  proposed  information  to  be  included  in  the  SmPC  seems,  at 
present,  premature.  Moreover,  such  data  are  based  on  an  initial  Mircera  dose  that  should  be  further 
justified.  Therefore,  the  inclusion  of  the  proposed  data  in  the  mentioned  sections  of  the  SmPC  is  not 
supported at this stage (see also efficacy discussion).    
1.5.  Efficacy data 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The efficacy is based on the results of a single clinical study, NH19707, supported by PK/PD model-based 
which is described and discussed above in clinical pharmacology section. 
Study NH19707 is a phase II, dose-finding study, open-label, multicenter, multiple dose study of Mircera 
administered  once  every  4  weeks  intravenously  (IV)  for  20  weeks  in  paediatric  patients  with  chronic 
kidney  disease  (CKD)  receiving  hemodialysis  who  switched  from  other  erythropoiesis-stimulating  agent 
(ESAs)  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa).  After  the  first  administration  of  methoxy  polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin  beta  (Mircera),  dose  adjustments  were  permitted  to  maintain  target  hemoglobin  (Hb) 
levels,  which  were  measured  once  a  week  during  the  core  study  period.  The  evaluation  period  for  Hb 
levels  was  Week  17-21.Patients  who  completed  the  20  weeks  of  treatment  and  who  adequately 
maintained  Hb  levels  were  eligible  to  enter  an  optional  52-week  safety  extension  period  with  the  same 
dosing frequency. 
In  this  study,  the  protocol  foresaw  different  groups  with  different  conversion  factors  related  to  their 
previous  ESA  dose  to  find  the  optimum  Mircera  starting  dose.  The  first  group  comprised  patients  who 
started with an intermediate conversion factor dose (Group 1 hereinafter). If this intermediate conversion 
factor  proved  inadequate,  a  second  group  (Group  2)  was  enrolled  for  treatment  with  a  higher  or  lower 
conversion factor dose.

Figure 4. Core study design 
* The total number of patients was to be at least 36 in the group with optimum dose conversion 
The conversion factors tested in Group 1 were directly derived from experience in adults receiving Mircera 
intravenously  and  from  the  results  of  a  published  study  of  darbepoetin  alfa  conducted  in  paediatric 
patients (Warady et al 2006). As the patients included in this study were already on stable maintenance 
doses  of  an  ESA  prior  to  conversion  to  Mircera,  and  assuming  a  linear  relationship  across  dose  ranges, 
the use of a conversion factor resulted in a Mircera dose that was proportional to the previous ESA dose, 
thus correcting for the higher weight-adjusted dose requirements in paediatric patients. 
The  first  16  patients  were  enrolled  in  Group  1.  After  16  patients  had  completed  at  least  16  weeks  of 
treatment, a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of Mircera was made. 
For the preliminary efficacy assessment, the uncorrected 90% confidence interval (CI) for the average Hb 
change from baseline to weeks 14-16 was calculated. If the lower limit of the CI was ≥-1 g/dL, the upper 
limit ≤1 g/dL and the number of dose increases and decreases had been approximately balanced across 
the  patients,  no  other  dose  group  would  have  been  started,  and  additional  patients  would  have  been 
recruited to receive the same Mircera dose. 
This condition was not met; the lower limit of the CI for average Hb change was below -1 g/dL (see Table 
8). A high-conversion-factor group as per the study design was therefore initiated (Group 2) based on a 
conversion factor from previous ESA dose, double that of Group 1 (4 x previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] 
/ 125 or 4 x previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose [μg] / 0.55). 
A preliminary assessment suggested higher than expected variability in Hb; so the protocol was amended 
to increase the minimum size of Group 2 from 25 to 36 patients. Replacement of patients not completing 
at  least  18  weeks  of  treatment  led  to  a  total  of  48  patients  in  Group  2.  The  primary  analysis  was 
performed once all patients of this optimum dose group had completed the core study (visit Week 21). 
Patients  completing  the  20  weeks  of  treatment  with  Hb  within  ±  1  g/dL  of  their  baseline  Hb  and  within 
the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period. During 
this  period,  the  patients  continued  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  4  weeks  and  Hb  concentration 
measurements occurred less frequently (every 4 weeks).

The  target  population  comprised  paediatric  patients  5  -  17  years  old  with  clinically  stable  chronic  renal 
anemia on hemodialysis treatment and who were receiving maintenance treatment with an erythropoietic 
agent. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was as follows: 
o  Change  in  Hb  concentration  (g/dL)  between  the  baseline  period  and  the  evaluation  period 
(weeks 17-21) 
The secondary efficacy endpoints assessed were as follows: 
o  Number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period within ±1 
g/dL of their baseline Hb 
o  Number  of  patients  with  an  average  Hb  concentration  during  the  evaluation  period  above, 
within or below the range of 10-12 g/dL 
o 
Incidence of red blood cell transfusions 
o  Change in reticulocyte count (x10000 /μL) between the baseline and evaluation periods 
Finally, the following exploratory efficacy endpoints were also defined: 
o  Change in dose over time 
o  Change in dose between study start and evaluation period 
o  The rate of rise in Hb concentration during the titration period 
Change  in  Hb  concentration  (g/dL)  between  the  baseline  and  evaluation  periods  (primary  efficacy 
endpoint)  was  calculated on  a  per-patient  basis,  using  an  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  approach.  For  all 
analyses  concerning  Hb,  no  imputation  was  made  for  missing  values  and  analysis  was  performed  on 
observed cases only. Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In addition, baseline 
covariate adjusted estimates of Hb change from baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI 
were calculated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
Mircera  was  administered  by  a  trained  healthcare  professional  once  every  4  weeks  for  20  weeks  (core 
study  period)  and  up  to  52  additional  weeks  in  patients  who  entered  the  safety  extension  period.  The 
starting doses were based on the following conversion factors: 
Intermediate conversion factor (Group 1) 
o  4  x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)/250  or  4  x  previous  weekly  darbepoetin  alfa  dose 
(μg)/1.1. 
High conversion factor (Group 2) 
o  4  x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)/125  or  4  x  previous  weekly  darbepoetin  alfa  dose 
(μg)/0.55. 
Between  July  2008  and  June  2015,  a  total  of  112  patients  were  screened  at  28  sites  in  Belgium  (2), 
France  (6),  Germany  (5),  Hungary  (1),  Italy  (1),  Poland  (5),  Romania  (1),  Spain  (3),  Thailand  (2)  and 
Ukraine (2). 
Of the 112 screened patients, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2). 
Replacement  of  patients  not  completing  at  least  18  weeks  of  treatment  led  to  a  total  of  48  patients  in 
Group 2.

As  shown  in  the  following  figure,  12  patients  in  Group  1  and  35  in  Group  2  completed  the  evaluation 
period.  Thirty-seven  of  these  completers  went  on  to  participate  in  the  optional  1-year  safety  extension, 
which was completed by 17 patients in total. 
Figure 5. Patient disposition of study NH19707 
During the core study period, 4 patients in Group 1 (25%) and 13 in the Group 2 (27%) withdrew from 
treatment. The most frequently reported reason for withdrawal was renal transplant (4 patients in Group 
1  and  9  patients  in  Group  2).  Of  the  two  ‘other’  reasons  one  was  due  to  liver  transplant,  the  other 
because the department moved to another hospital. 
One  patient  in  Group  2  died  during  the  core  study  period  of  intracranial  hematoma,  considered  not 
related to study drug. 
During the extension period, 20 patients withdrew (16 due to renal transplant, two withdrew consent and 
a further two, at the same center, due to ‘repair of the dialysis station’). 
During the whole study, patients were in the study for a total of 45 patient exposure years (PEY), with a 
mean of 0.7 PEY per patient. In the extension period 25 patients were treated for at least an additional 5 
months with a total of 23.8 PEY in this period. 
Results 
Patient Demographics 
Overall,  there  were  34  male  patients  (53%),  with  a  higher  representation  in  Group  1  compared  with 
Group 2 (see table 3). The majority of patients were Caucasian, and the mean ±  SD age was 11 ± 3.2 
years in Group 1 and 13 ± 3.1 years in Group 2. Younger patients (aged 5-11 years) were more strongly 
represented in Group 1 (56%) compared with Group 2 (33%). The youngest patient was 6 years old. The 
age distribution is represented graphically in figure below, showing a more evenly distributed age range

in  Group  1  and  one  skewed  more  towards  the  older  children  in  Group  2.  These  distributions  are  also 
reflected in the weight and height, with correspondingly heavier, taller children in Group 2. One 17-year-
old patient in Group 2 is recorded as the single smoker. 
Median  Z  scores  for  height  and  pre-dialysis  weight  were  negative  in  both  groups  (height:  -1.07  and  -
1.67,  respectively,  for  Group  1  and  Group  2;  weight  -0.87  and  -1.32,  respectively),  indicating,  as 
expected in this patient population, under-developed, underweight patients compared with children of the 
same sex and age. 
The mean baseline body surface area (according to the Mosteller formula) was 1.14 and 1.24 in Group 1 
and Group 2, respectively.

Figure 6. Age Distribution at Baseline in Study NH19707: ITT Population 
Compared with the demographic data presented above for the overall core study population, the subset 
of patients who entered the safety extension had a greater proportion of males (62% versus 53%) and a 
higher  proportion  of  Caucasian  patients  (81%  versus  72%).  Other  demographic  characteristics  were 
similar to the core population. 
Baseline Laboratory Parameters 
Median  baseline  hemoglobin  levels  were  11.2  g/dL  in  Group  1  and  11.1  g/dL  in  Group  2  (see  table  4). 
Ferritin and calculated transferrin saturation levels were generally higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. Of 
note, overall, 12 patients (19%) had C reactive protein levels above 5 mg/L.

Previous ESA Therapy 
The median time since first ESA administration was 22 months in Group 1 and 14 months in Group 2 (see 
table 5). In Group 1, the last ESA administered prior to screening was darbepoetin in 8 patients (median 
weekly  dose,  17.5  µg)  and  epoetin  alfa/beta  in  8  patients  (median  weekly  dose,  4500  IU).  In  Group  2, 
the last ESA administered prior to screening was darbepoetin in 26 patients (median weekly dose, 20 µg) 
and  epoetin  alfa/beta  in  22  patients  (median  weekly  dose,  6000  IU).  For  the  patients  receiving 
darbepoetin,  most  patients  were  receiving  once-weekly  administrations.  For  those  patients  receiving 
epoetin  alfa/beta,  most  were  dosed  2-3  times  a  week,  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  posology 
authorized.

Previous and Concomitant Treatments 
This section describes outputs for all previous treatments and those for concomitant treatments. Previous 
treatments refer to treatments with a start date prior to date of first study drug, regardless of end date. 
Concomitant  treatments  refer  to  those  where  treatment  ended  after  the  time  of  first  study  drug, 
regardless of start date. With these definitions, treatments that were ongoing at baseline were considered 
as both prior and concomitant treatments. 
Anticoagulation Treatment 
All patients had anticoagulation treatment prior to study start with the most frequently used agents being 
heparin  sodium  (3  [19%]  in  Group  1  and  25  [52%]  in  Group  2)  and  enoxaparin  sodium  (11  [69%]  in 
Group 1 and 16 [33%] in Group 2). 
Iron Supplementation 
Most  patients  recorded  receiving  iron  supplementation  prior  to  study  start  (58  patients  [91%]);  during 
the  study,  including  the  safety  extension  period,  iron  supplementation  was  recorded  by  15  patients 
(94%) in Group 1 and 47 (98%) in Group 2. The most frequently used agents were iron sucrose, ferrous 
gluconate, and ferric hydroxide. 
Antihypertensive Agents 
Using a classification based on selected coded medication classes, at study start, 37 (58%) patients were 
taking  or  had  taken  ‘antihypertensive  and/or  diuretic  agents’,  the  most  common  categories  being 
angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  calcium  channel  blocking  agents  and  'beta-adrenoceptor 
blocking agents. There were 38 patients recorded as taking at least one of these agents during the study. 
Hemodialysis at Baseline 
The median duration of hemodialysis at baseline was 1.3 years in Group 1 and just under 1 year in Group 
2.  Approximately  75%  of  patients  had  been  on  hemodialysis  for  under  2.2  years,  and  had  dialysis 
treatment  (i.e.  possible  previous  peritoneal  dialysis)  for  less  than  4  years.  The  majority  of  patients  in 
both groups had three hemodialysis sessions per week. 
Mean  ±  SD  Kt/V,  a  measure  of  dialysis  adequacy,  was  1.57  ±  0.377  in  Group  1  and  1.60  ±  0.408  in 
Group 2 (a higher score indicates better dialysis adequacy, with 1.20 considered adequate). 
Mean ± SD urea reduction ratio, another measure of dialysis adequacy, was 79% ± 8.5% in Group 1 and 
72%  ±  9.0%  in  Group  2  (a  higher  percentage  indicates  better  dialysis  adequacy,  with  65%  considered 
adequate). 
Efficacy results 
PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
The changes from baseline to the evaluation period are summarized in the table 7. 
In the ANCOVA model of this data, with adjustment for dose group (Group 1/Group 2), age (5-11/12-18 
years), previous ESA treatment (darbepoetin alfa/epoetin alfa or beta) and baseline Hb AUC, the adjusted 
mean change in Hb AUC from baseline to evaluation period was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.32 to -0.16) for Group 
1 and -0.09 (95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26) for Group 2 (table 8). Terms from the model show no indication of a 
strong effect on change in Hb due to previous ESA treatment or age. 
In Group 2, mean Hb values remained above 10 g/dL and below 12 g/dL throughout the study. However, 
in  the  Group  1  there  was  a  clear  decrease  in  Hb  levels  during  the  titration  period,  with  mean  values 
dropping below 10 g/dL (see figure 7) and reaching a nadir at week 9 before increasing without returning 
to baseline levels at the start of the evaluation period. In both groups, there was a small increase in Hb at

the  start  of  the  study  from  baseline  to  week  3,  although  mean  levels  remained  below  12  g/dL  with  a 
mean increase from baseline of the order of 0.5 g/dL for Group 1 and less than 0.5 g/dL for Group 2 (see 
figure 8). 
In Group 2, 19 patients had Hb 1 g/dL or more above their baseline value at week 3, 17 at week 4, and 
11  at  week  5.  75%  of  patients  were  under  12.5  g/dL  at  week  4,  and  less  than  1.75  g/dL  from  their 
baseline value. The maximum Hb value seen at this time was 14.7 g/dL.

Mircera Dose during the Core Study Period 
A summary of the equivalent 4-weekly Mircera dose over time during the core study period is provided in 
the table below. 
When considering the median values, which are less affected by outliers, in Group 2, the dose decreased 
slightly  through  to  week  13  and  then  increased  for the  fifth  and  final  dose  at week  17.  In  Group  1,  the 
median dose increased slowly throughout the core study, in response to the course of Hb over time.

Conversion Factors for Previous Weekly ESA Dose during the Evaluation Period 
The  conversion  factors  for  previously  weekly  ESA  dose  to  equivalent  weekly  Mircera  dose  during  the 
evaluation period are shown in the table below. In Group 2, the median [IQR] conversion factors were 1.8 
[1.4, 2.8] for darbepoetin alfa and 0.008 [0.005, 0.01] for epoetin alfa/beta. These are both very close to 
the conversion factors used to calculate the first dose (1/0.55=1.8 and 1/125=0.008 for darbepoetin and

Mircera Dose during Evaluation: Safety Population 
Dose Adjustments during the Core Study Period 
During the core study period, dose changes occurred frequently in both conversion factor groups (77% of 
patients in  Group  2  and  81%  in  Group  1  required  a  dose  change)  (see  table 14).  A  lower  proportion  of 
patients  in  Group  2  compared  to  Group  1  required  a  dose  increase  only  during  the  core  study  period 
(29%  compared  to  56%).  A  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  Group  2  required  no  dose  change  (23%) 
compared with Group 1 (19%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 had both dose decreases and 
increases (38%) compared with Group 1 (13%). 
In  terms  of  absolute  numbers  of dose  changes,  the  mean  number  of  dose increases  and  decreases  was 
1.69 and 0.25, respectively, in Group 1 and 1.19 and 0.73, respectively, in Group 2.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The difference in change in average Hb between baseline and evaluation periods was similar in both age 
groups. In Group 2, while the medians were either side of zero, the difference in medians between the 2 
age groups was 0.27 g/dL (see table 16). 
With  respect  to  Hb  change  from  baseline  over  time,  in  Group  2,  the  two  age  groups  have  very  similar 
changes over the first 8 weeks of the study, after this time there is more variability, with the smaller 5-11 
year-old category showing slightly larger peaks and troughs (see figure 11).

Mircera Dose during the Core Study Period 
In Group 2, the median equivalent 4-weekly dose during the evaluation period (week 17) was 89 and 127 
μg/4 weeks in the 5-11 and 12-17 year age groups respectively (see table 17). These values were very 
similar  to  the  median  starting  doses  (86  and  150  μg/4  weeks).  The  equivalent  values  for  dose  per 
kilogram bodyweight were 2.8 and 3.3 μg/kg/4 weeks (see table 18). When looking at the dose per body 
surface  area,  in  Group  2,  the  dose  during  the  evaluation  period  for  the  younger  and  older  age  groups 
respectively was 93 and 111 μg/4-weeks/m2. 
When  considering  the  individual  patient  ratios of  initial dose to  dose  during  evaluation  (see  table  19) in 
Group 2, there was a small increase (1.25) in the medians in the 5-11 age group whereas the ratio was 
close to 1 in the 12-17 age group (0.98). In the younger age group, this corresponds to not more than 
one protocol specified dose change of 25%. In Group 1, the median ratios were both greater than 1 (1.81 
for the 5-11 age group and 1.59 for the 12-17 age group). 
While absolute doses differ, results for changes in dose are generally reflected in the smaller Group 1 age 
subsets. Overall for Group 1, dose increases were required and larger increases were seen in the younger 
patients and smaller increases in the older patients.

In Group 1, 8 patients were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 8 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta. In 
Group 2, 26 were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 22 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
When  considering  changes  in  Hb  over  time  in  Group  2,  the  mean  Hb  change  from  baseline  for  patients 
previously  on  darbepoetin  alfa  was  generally  below  baseline  whereas  the  mean  for  patients  previously

EFFICACY EVALUATIONS DURING THE SAFETY EXTENSION PERIOD 
Hemoglobin over Time 
In Group 2, during the safety extension period, all mean Hb values remained within the 10-12 g/dL range 
(Figure 12). In Group 1, although mean values were below this range at some time points during the core 
study  period,  in  the  safety  extension  period,  mean  values  in  this  group  also  remained  within  the  10-12 
g/dL. 
The change from baseline in Group 2 during the safety extension period fluctuated around baseline (see 
figure below). In Group 1, change from baseline returned to close to baseline, although any conclusions 
should  be  treated  with  caution  given  the  low  patient  numbers  in  Group  1  (n=5  after  Week  45). 
Hemoglobin levels over time were similar for the patients aged 5-11 years and those aged 12-17 years, 
although comparisons are limited by the low patient numbers, particularly at later time points. 
Due to the high withdrawal rate, the applicant used the values at the time each individual patient exited 
the  study  for  evaluation  instead  of  values  at  week  73.  At  study  exit,  16  of  the  28  patients  in  Group  2 
(57%) had Hb levels within ± 1 g/dL of baseline and 20 (71%) had Hb levels within 10-12 g/dL. In Group 
1, 7 of the 9 patients (78%) had Hb levels within ± 1 g/dL and 6 (67%) had Hb levels within 10-12 g/dL.

1.6.  Rapporteur's discussion 
The MAH has provided the results of a standalone study (NH19707) concerning PK in children to support 
the amendments to the product information, sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2.  
Study NH19707 was a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study designed to provide evidence 
on  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population    (5-17  years  old)  with  CKD  anaemia  on 
hemodialysis, following iv administration of Mircera after switching from other ESAs (i.e epoetin alfa/beta 
or  darbepoetin  alfa).  This  study  is  part  of  the  PIP  that  was  modified  in  September  2017  due  to  the 
unfeasibility  to  conduct  the  phase  III  confirmatory  study  initially  planned.  Instead  of  carrying  out  this 
phase  III  study,  PDCO  agreed  with  conducting,  in  addition  to  study  NH19707,  two  new  studies  (i.e 
NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies). The first one (NH19708) is a phase 2 study designed to ascertain the 
starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously in paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not 
yet  on  dyalisis  when  switching  with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or  dabepoetin  alfa.  The  second  one  is  a 
population PK/PD model including adult data from previous studies and children data from NH19707 and 
NH19708 studies.  
The duration of study NH19707 was 20 weeks (core phase). After 2 weeks of screening period, patients 
were  given  Mircera  for  16  weeks  of  dose  titration  and  continued  4  weeks  more  during  the  evaluation 
period.  The  protocol  included  two  different  groups  with  different  conversion  factors  based  on  their 
previous  ESA  dose  to  find  the  optimum  Mircera  starting  dose.  Group  1  comprised  patients  who  started 
with  an  intermediate  conversion  factor  dose.  In  the  adaptive  design,  this  starting  dose  proved  
inadequate  and  a  group  2  was  enrolled  for  treatment  with  a  higher  conversion  factor  dose,  double than 
that of group 1. 
Patients  completing  the  20  weeks  of  treatment  with  Hb  within  ±  1  g/dL  of  their  baseline  Hb  and  within 
the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period. During 
this  period,  the  patients  continued  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  4  weeks  with  Hb  concentration 
measurements  occurred  less  frequently  (every  4  weeks.  As  the  safety  extension  phase  only  included 
patients  who  had  adequate  response  to  treatment  after  the  core  phase  efficacy  results  during  the 
extension phase (i.e. long-term efficacy results) should be taken cautiously due to the selection bias. 
During  the  core  study  phase,  4  patients  in  group  1  and  13  in  group  2  withdrew  from  treatment  renal 
transplant being the main reason. The MAH  replaced these patients with new ones in order to maintain 
the  sample  size  planned  at  the  beginning  of  the  study.  The  replacement  of  patients  is  problematic  and 
may  lead  to  bias.  A  detailed  justification  is  anticipated  in  case  that  a  variation  for  the  extension  of  the 
indication to children is submitted in the future.  
Of the 112 screened patients, only 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2). The 
mean age was 11 and 13 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Children recruited in Group 2 were a bit 
older. The number of patients between 5 to 11 years of age was greater in group 1 than in group 2 with a 
low representation of patients younger than 8 years of age, mainly in group 2. Therefore, currently there 
is  no  information  on  PK  in  children  younger  than  5  years  of  age  until  results  from  study  NH19708  are 
available.  
Two doses have been studied based on two different conversion factors. A total of 16 patients were given 
Mircera  IV  with  a  starting  dose  based  on  4x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)  /250  or  4x  previous 
weekly darbepoetin (μg) /1.1. In the second group a total of 16 patients received a starting Mircera dose 
double than  that  of  group  1,  it  means  4x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)/125  or 4x  previous  weekly 
Assessment report

darbepoetin alfa μg/0.55.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  in  Hb  concentration  (g/dL)  between  the  baseline  period 
and  the  evaluation  period  (weeks  17-21).  The  adjusted  mean  change  in  Hb  from  baseline  to  the 
evaluation  period  was  -0.09  g/dl  (95%IC:  -0.45  to  0.26)  in  group  2  and  -0.74  g/dl  (95%  IC  -1.32  to  -
0.16)  in  group  1.  These  results,  in  principle,  would  support  the  conversion  factor  used  in  group  2 
although some issues remain unresolved at this point.  
During  the  core  phase  the  dose  administered  could  be  adjusted  in  order  to  maintain  Hb  levels  between 
10-12 g/dL. It was observed that in group 2 children 5-11 years increased dose administered along the 
core  period  while  children  12-17  years  tended  to  maintain  or  slightly  decrease  doses  along  the  same 
period of time. Moreover, subgroup analysis by age group showed less variability in the response in the 
5-11 year subgroup (group 2) compared to the 12-17 year subgroup (the median changes of Hb between 
baseline and evaluation period were 0.08 vs. -0.19, respectively).   
Secondary variables showed more stable Hb levels in the group 2 than in the group 1 throughout the core 
study  period.  In  group  2,  75%  of  patients  maintained  Hb  values  within  ±1  g/dL  of  baseline  and  80.6% 
within 10-12 g/dL. There were also fewer patients who needed dose adjustments in group 2 compared to 
group  1  (77%  vs.  81%,  respectively).  For  these  reasons  the  MAH  considered  that  the  conversion  factor 
used in group 2 could be  the one selected to adjust the Mircera dose in children who  switch from other 
ESA. It is important to highlight that, for the conversion factor used in group 2, around 20% of children 
did not reach the Hb target (i.e 10-12 g/dl). This is of concern if it is considered that children were stable 
on their previously ESA treatment (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa).  
Three  patients  needed  blood  transfusion  during  the  core  period,  one  in  Group  1  due  to  haemoglobin 
decrease  and  two  in  Group  2  due  to  procedural  haemorrhage  and  intracraneal  haematoma  (see  safety 
section). 
Efficacy assessment during the safety extension period showed that mean Hb values remained within the 
target  (i.e  10-12  g/dL) over  this  period  regardless  of  the  group  (1  or  2).  As  mentioned  before,  efficacy 
results  during  this  phase  should  be  carefully  considered  as  only  patients  who  adequately  responded  to 
treatment after the core phase were included in the extension. 
The  conversion  factors  used  to  calculate  the  initial  dose  were  1/0.55=1.8  and  1/125=0.008  for 
darboepoetin and epoetins respectively. The MAH reanalysed the real conversion factor used throughout 
core  period  according  to  the  doses  used  along  this  period.  This  calculation  showed  that  the  median 
conversion  factors  were 1.8  (1.4,  2.8)  for  darbepoetin  alfa  and  0.008  (0.005, 0.01)  for  epoetins.  Taken 
into account the observed ranges it seems that the real conversion factor used for epoetins is close to the 
initial ones proposed. However, for darbepoetin the differences between initial and real conversion factor 
seems  to  be  greater  as  shown  by  the  wide  range  observed.  In  fact,  the  mean  Hb  change  from  baseline 
over  time  by  previous  ESA  treatment  during  the  core  study  showed  less  fluctuation  in  the  group  of 
patients who received epoetin previously compare to patients previously on darbepoetin. Whether this is 
related to the initial conversion factors proposed is unknown for the time being.  
The efficacy results of study NH19707 seem to be promising. However, there are some uncertainties that 
may need further discussion when all the data in children are available, mainly, the variability in the dose 
administered during the core phase for the age subgroups and the conversion factors used in relation to 
previous ESA used. In addition, an important proportion of children included in group 2 (which seems to 
be in principle the conversion factor selected by the MAH for switching) did not reach the Hb target (i.e 
10-12 g/dl). This is relevant since they were stable on their previously ESA treatment and could question 
the appropriateness of switching to Mircera. 
The MAH has proposed to include the results of study NH19707 in section 5.1. of the SmPC.  According to 
the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics only evidence from relevant studies supporting the 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019

indication should be included in this section. The current indication is limited to adults so the inclusion of 
data on children in section 5.1. is not supported at this stage. Please see SmPC in a separate document. 
2.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.1.  Methods  
The primary safety information is derived from study NH19707 in paediatric patients 5-17 years old with 
clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anemia  on  hemodialysis  treatment  and  who  were  receiving  maintenance 
treatment  with  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  (ESA)  prior  to  switching  to  methoxy  polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera). 
This  Phase  II,  dose-finding  study  was  an  open-label,  multicenter,  multiple  dose  study  of  Mircera 
administered  intravenously  (IV)  once  every  4  weeks  for  20  weeks  (core  study  period)  in  paediatric 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetin 
alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). Patients who completed the core study period with hemoglobin (Hb) within 
± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 
52-week safety extension period (total duration of treatment, up to 73 weeks). 
After  the  first  administration  of  Mircera,  dose  adjustments  were  permitted  to  maintain  target  Hb  levels, 
which  were  measured  once  a  week  during  the  core  study  period  and  once  every  four  weeks  during  the 
safety extension. Two groups were enrolled, Group 1 with an intermediate conversion factor and Group 2 
with a high conversion factor. 
The  clinical  safety  of  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  is  further  supported  by  analysis  of  post-marketing 
adverse  event  (AE)  reports  and  data  from  international  registries  recording  use  of  Mircera  in  paediatric 
patients as well as reports of paediatric Mircera use in the literature. 
A  total  of  64  paediatric  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Mircera  in  this  study.  The  extent  of 
exposure (core study and safety extension) is summarized in table 20. Nineteen patients were exposed to 
Mircera for at least 15 months.

Phase II Study NH19707 
Common Adverse Events 
Core Study Period 
For the Core Period, overall, 49/64 patients (77%) reported at least one AE (12/16 [75%] in Group 1 and 
37/48 [77%] in Group 2) (see table 21).

Table  21.  Summary  of  Adverse  Events  Reported  in  the  Core  Period  of  Study  NH19707:  Safety 
Population.  
Adverse events with a frequency ≥  2% by SOC during the core period is shown in Table 22. Most of the 
AEs  were  associated  with  CKD,  other  previous  and  concurrent  risk  factors/diseases  and  treatments, 
and/or dialysis-induced, and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. 
The  most  affected  SOCs  were  Infections  and  infestations  (30/64  patients  overall  [47%]),  General 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (12/64  patients  [19%]),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (12/64 
patients overall [19%]) and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]). 
The  individual  AEs  reported  in  more  than  5%  of  patients  overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (9/64  patients 
[14%]),  headache  (9/64  [14%]),  vomiting  (6/64  patients  [9%]),  hypertension  (8/64  patients  [13%]), 
abdominal pain (4/64 patients [6%]), and bronchitis (4/64 patients [6%]).

Table 22. Summary of Adverse Events (≥2% of patients overall) by SOC during the Core Period 
of Study NH19707: Safety Population. 
Seven  AEs  in  5/64  patients  (8%)  overall  (1  AE  [decreased  Hb]  in  1  patient  in  Group  1  and  6  AEs 
[arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, extensive interdialytic weight gain, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, 
dental  caries,  thrombosis  in  device] in  4 patients  in Group  2)  were  considered  by  the investigator  to be 
related to the study drug. 
Adverse Events by Intensity 
Two  life-threatening  AEs  occurred,  both  in  patients  in  Group  2  and  reported  by  the  investigator  as 
unrelated  to  the  study  medication:  intracranial  hematoma  caused  by  a  fall  resulting  in  death    and 
procedural  hemorrhage  during  dialysis  caused  by  a  poorly  adapted  dialysate  filter  and  leading  to 
worsening of anemia.

In addition, 10 severe AEs were reported in 7/64 patients (11%). The only severe AE to be reported more 
than once was arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2 patients, 1 in each group). Of the remaining AEs, there 
were 42 moderate AEs in 26/64 patients (41%) and 81 mild AEs in 35/64 patients (55%). 
Safety Extension Period 
During the safety extension period, 27/37 patients (73%) experienced at least one AE (4 [44%] in Group 
1 and 23 [82%] in Group 2) (see table 23).  
Table 23. Overview of Adverse Events during the Safety Extension Period: Safety Population. 
Adverse events with a frequency ≥  2% by SOC during the safety extension period is shown in Table 24. 
As  in  the  core  period,  the  SOC  with  the  most  number  of  events  was  Infections  and  infestations  (17 
patients overall [46%] had an AE in this SOC). 
The  most  frequently  reported  individual  AEs  overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (7  [19%]),  headache  (6 
[16%]), and hypertension (5 [14%]). 
Two patients (both in Group 2) had 2 AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: 
anemia and urinary tract infection.

Extension Period of Study NH19707: Safety Population. 
Adverse Events by Intensity. 
Overall, there were no life-threatening AEs and 5 severe AEs reported during the safety extension period 
(all  in  patients  in  Group  2).  These  events  were  hypotension,  hypertension,  arteriovenous  fistula 
thrombosis, arterial injury, and sleep disorder. None of these events were considered by the investigator 
to be related to the study drug. 
Deaths 
One fatal SAE was reported in the core study period (intracranial hematoma). The event was the result of 
a  domestic  head  trauma  and  subsequent  dialysis  with  heparin,  and  considered  by  the  investigator 
unrelated to the study drug.

Overall, including the aforementioned fatal SAE, 16/64 patients (25%) reported a total of 25 SAEs (4/16 
[25%] in Group 1 and 12/48 [25%] in Group 2) (Table 25). The most commonly affected SOCs (with > 
5%  of  patients  overall  with  SAEs)  were  Infections  and  infestations  (8  patients  overall  [13%]),  General 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (4  patients  overall  [6%]),  and  Injury,  poisoning  and 
procedural complications (4 patients overall [6%]). 
SAEs reported in more than 1 patient overall included device-related infection (3 patients), bronchitis (2), 
thrombosis in device (2), arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2), procedural hemorrhage (2), fluid overload 
(2), and hypertension (2).

Safety Extension Period 
Overall, 9/37 patients (24%) reported a total of 12 SAEs (1/9 [11%] in Group 1 and 8/28 [29%] in Group 
2)  (Table  26).  Three  of  these  patients  had  already  experienced  SAEs  during  the  core  period.  The  most 
commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  at  least  2  patients  overall  with  SAEs)  were  Injury,  poisoning  and 
procedural  complications  (3  patients  overall  [8%]),  Vascular  disorders  (3  patients  overall  [8%]),  and 
gastrointestinal disorders (2 patients overall [6%]). 
Table  26.  Summary  of  Serious  Adverse  Events  by  SOC  during  the  Safety  Extension  Period  of 
Study NH19707: Safety Population. 
The only individual SAE reported in more than 1 patient overall was hypertension (2 patients). Of the AEs 
classified as serious, none were considered related to the study medication. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Adverse Events That Led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment 
One  patient  died  and  did  not  complete  study  treatment  during  the  core  study  period.  No  patients  were 
withdrawn from study treatment due to non-fatal AEs in either study period. 
The  withdrawal  rate  (see  table  21)  was  higher  than  initially  expected,  although  these  withdrawals  were 
not related to safety but related to transplantation and may reflect a decreased time on the waiting lists 
for kidney transplantation. 
Adverse Events That Led to Dose Modification 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019 
Page 49/57 
  
  
 
No AEs led to dose modification at any time during the study. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Ogan system or Syndrome 
The most clinically relevant specific adverse effects of ESAs as a class that should be considered a priori 
as potential safety concerns in children are selected to be hypertension, vascular access thrombosis and 
anti-erythropoietin  antibody-induced  pure  red  cell  aplasia  (AEAB-PRCA).  Hypertension  was  the  most 
common AE in all treatment groups in most pivotal and post-approval Mircera studies in adults. In these 
studies,  the  incidence  of  hypertension  was  similar  in  patients  treated  with  Mircera  compared  to  those 
receiving  comparator  ESAs.  Vascular  access  thrombosis  is  common  in  the  hemodialysis  population.  In 
adults,  no  events  of  PRCA  were  reported  in  clinical  trials  during  clinical  development  while  there  are  8 
spontaneous reports of confirmed AEABPRCA after exclusive use of Mircera. 
Hypertension 
Core Study Period 
Overall, at baseline, 32 patients (50%) had hypertension reported by the investigator as one of the risk 
factors  for  vascular  events  and  hemorrhage  and  37  (58%)  were  already  receiving  or  had  received 
antihypertensive and/or diuretic agents. During the core study period, 8 patients (13%) had an increase 
in antihypertensive treatment. 
Of  the  8  patients  with  arterial  hypertension  reported  as  an  AE  during  the  core  study  period,  7  had  pre-
existing hypertension at enrollment or within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, and 1 had previously received 
antihypertensive  therapy  although  this  patient  was  not  reported  to  have  hypertension  at  enrollment  or 
within 12 weeks of enrollment. In 1 patient, hypertension was reported as severe in intensity and as an 
SAE.  The  event  resolved with  treatment  (doxazosin  and  carvedilol).  One  case  of  moderate  hypertension 
was also reported as an SAE. 
Pre-  and  post-dialysis  blood  pressure  measurements  were  performed  in  all  patients  during  the  study. 
Values  remained  close  to  baseline  level,  and  no  clear  trend  or  difference  between  groups  was  apparent 
during the study 
Safety Extension Period 
During the safety extension period, 9 patients (24%) had increased antihypertensive treatment compared 
with baseline (5 of these already had increased antihypertensive treatment in the core period). 
There were 5 adverse events of hypertension reported during this period. One patient with hypertension 
in the safety extension period had already reported a hypertension event during the core period. In that 
patient, both events were considered serious and severe; an increase in antihypertensive treatment was 
reported after the second event. 
During the extension period, two patients reported hypertension as an SAE. In both cases, the event was 
associated with a change in antihypertensive medication. 
Vascular Access Thrombosis 
Core Study Period 
During the core study period, 4 patients (3 in Group 2 and 1 in Group 1) reported 5 events that may be 
classified as vascular access thrombosis. These events were defined as ‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ 
in 2 patients and ‘thrombosis in device’ in 2 patients (1 patient experienced 2 such events). 
All cases were classified as SAEs. For 3 of the patients, the events were considered severe, and 2 cases 
(one  case  of  ‘arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis’  and  one  case  of  ‘thrombosis  in  device’)  were  considered 
related to study medication. In all cases, the events resolved without sequelae. 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019 
Page 50/57 
  
  
Safety Extension Period 
During the safety extension period, 3 patients reported 5 events classified as vascular access thrombosis 
(different  patients  from  those  with  such  events  during  the  core  period).  These  were  coded  as 
‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ in 2 cases and ‘thrombosis in device’ in 3 cases. 
Three of these events (two reports of `thrombosis in device’ in 1 patient and 1 report of ‘arteriovenous 
fistula thrombosis’ in another patient) were classified as SAEs. One of these events (’arteriovenous fistula 
thrombosis’) was also a severe AE. None of these events were considered related to study medication and 
all resolved without sequelae. 
Anti-Erythropoietin Antibody-Induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia 
No patients developed anti-drug antibodies or anti-erythropoietin antibodies during the study. No patients 
developed PRCA. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Hematology 
In  this  study,  Hb  concentrations,  reticulocytes,  and  red  blood  cell  counts  were  considered  part  of  the 
efficacy assessment. One patient had a moderate AE of Hb decreased due, according to the investigator, 
to the latency effect of Mircera. This AE resolved. 
In  clinical  trials  of  Mircera  in  adults,  slight  decreases  in  platelet  counts  have  been  observed.  In  study 
NH19707,  median  platelet  count  at  baseline  was  221.5  x  109/L  (range  182-398)  and  208.0  x  109/L 
(range 80-518) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, and decreased slightly during the core study period 
in both groups but remained within 16% and 20% of baseline, respectively. There was substantial within- 
and  between-patient  variability  of  platelets  in  both  groups.  In  Group  1,  1/16  patients  had  one  or  more 
postbaseline  values  below  the  site-specific  normal  range  (typically  150-400  ×  109/L).  None  had  values 
above  normal  range.  In  Group  2,  19/47  patients  had  one  or  more  postbaseline  values  below  normal 
range,  of  whom  6/19  already  had  low  values  at  baseline,  and  4/47  patients  had  one  or  more  post-
baseline values above normal range, of whom 1/4 already had a high value at baseline. 
During  the  extension  period,  platelet  values  below  the  site-specific  normal  range  were  reported  in  2 
patients (29%) in Group 1 and 15 patients (60%) in Group 2. 
No events of bleeding were reported in any patients who  had one or more post-baseline platelet counts 
below  normal.  Thrombocytopenia  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  four  patients;  in  all  cases,  the  event  was 
classified as mild and unrelated to study drug. 
During  the  core  study  period,  median  hematocrit  remained  within  15%  of  baseline  for  both  groups  and 
remained stable during the safety extension period. 
Chemistry 
Over  the  entire  study  period,  median  changes  from  baseline  for  aspartate  aminotransferase,  alanine 
aminotransferase,  serum  albumin,  calcium,  blood  glucose  parameters,  as  well  as  for  potassium  and 
phosphate,  were  minor,  with  no  obvious  trends  over  time.  Abnormal  post-baseline  values  for  these 
parameters were observed only sporadically. The only abnormalities in these parameters reported as AEs 
were  hyperkalemia  (4  patients  in  total),  hyperphosphatemia  (3  patients  in  total)  and  hypocalcemia  (1 
patient in total). Two of these AEs were reported as severe (hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia). 
Post  baseline  values  ≥   800  U/L  were  seen  at  some  timepoint  throughout  the  study  for  alkaline 
phosphatase in 4 and 3 patients in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. None of these abnormalities were 
associated with AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/131222/2019 
Page 51/57 
  
  
C-reactive protein 
Median  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  levels  remained  close  to  or  below  the  baseline  value  throughout  the 
study.  The  majority  of  patients  had  normal  CRP  levels  at  baseline  and  these  values  remained  within 
normal range throughout the study. None of these patients experienced AEs. 
Iron parameters 
In  Group  2,  the  largest  median  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  at  Week  13  for  iron  (+6.75  μM/L 
from  12.00  μM/L  at  baseline),  at  Week  61  for  ferritin  (245.38  μg/L  from  328.00  μg/L  for  ferritin)  and 
Week 53 for transferrin saturation (13.11% from 26.82% at baseline). A similar pattern was observed in 
Group 1. In all cases, median values for these parameters remained within normal values. Two patients 
reported AEs related to iron parameters: iron deficiency and iron overload. 
Neither of these events was considered related to Mircera. 
Vital signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety 
During the core period, plots of pre-dialysis Z scores for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure  (DBP)  showed  no  clear  trend  throughout  the  study,  with  median  Z  scores  within  ±  1  of  the 
baseline. During the safety extension period, changes from baseline remained small in Group 2. Group 1 
showed  greater  fluctuation,  particularly  after  Week  57,  although  this  may  be  a  consequence  of  the  low 
patient numbers. 
In both dose groups approximately 60% of patients had at least three consecutive predialysis and post-
dialysis  SBP  or  DBP  values  at or  above  the  age,  sex,  and  weight  specific  95th  percentile.  Median  sitting 
pulse rate did not change by more than 10 bpm with respect to baseline at any time during the study. 
Changes in height and weight 
Analysis of changes in height and weight did not reveal any indication of an impact of Mircera on growth. 
Immunogenicity 
No  patients  tested  positive  for  erythropoietin  antibodies  or  anti-drug  antibodies  at  any  time  during  the 
study, including the safety extension period. 
Post-marketing adverse event (AE), International Registries and paediatric Mircera use in the 
literature. 
Post-marketing surveillance 
Post-marketing surveillance data, including suspected serious adverse reactions, accumulated for Mircera 
since approval have been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency and 
other  Health  Authorities on  a  regular  basis  in  the  form  of  Periodic  Safety  Reports,  including  any  reports 
from the paediatric population. 
Cumulatively until 19 July 2017, 33 reports (28 serious, 5 non-serious) with 54 events (45 serious and 9 
non-serious)  were  received  from  patients  aged  5-17  years,  who  were  treated  with  Mircera,  mostly  for 
nephrogenic anemia. 
Of these 33 reports, 4 had fatal outcomes. These cases were reported from noninterventional programs 
(NIPs).  In  3  cases  the  event  death  was  reported  and  assessed  as  unrelated  to Mircera.  In  one  of  these 
cases,  the  patient  had  dysgerminoma  with  unreported  outcome;  in  another  case  venous  access  was  no 
longer available for hemodialysis and the patient was on palliative care (not medically confirmed); in the 
third  case  the  patient  died  due  to  underlying  disease.  In  the  fourth  case  report,  cellulitis  with  fatal 
outcome  was  reported;  however,  this  case  was  not  medically  confirmed  and  no  causal  relationship  was 
reported.

Only in 1 case (out of 33) did the reporter consider the serious events of thrombocytopenia and diarrhea 
in a patient hospitalized for renal transplantation as ‘related’ to Mircera. At the time of reporting and upon 
discontinuation of Mircera treatment, the events were persisting. No further information was available. 
No  new/unexpected  information  was  identified  from  either  the  spontaneously  reported  (6)  (no  case 
reports from the literature) or NIP solicited cases (27). 
It is not known how many paediatric patients are treated off-label with Mircera. 
International Registries 
Based on the International Paediatric Dialysis Network (IPDN), which is a global consortium of paediatric 
nephrology centers dedicated to the care of chlidren on chronic dialysis and who maintains two registries: 
The International Paediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network (IPPN) registry for children on chronic peritoneal 
dialysis  (collects  data  from  115  centers  in  40  countries),  and  the  International  Paediatric  Hemodialysis 
Network  (IPHN)  registry  for  children  on  hemodialysis  (75  centers  in  35  countries).  Together,  the  two 
registries currently include data from more than 3750 patients. 
Hospitalization  terms  for  136  paediatric  patients  treated  with  Mircera  on  peritoneal  or  hemodialysis 
included  in  the  IPDN  registries  did  not  reveal  any  unexpected  safety  concerns  in  this  patient  population 
and were aligned with the events observed in Study NH19707.  
Use in Literature 
Mircera  has  been  studied  in  two  small  investigator-initiated  trials.  Cano  et  al  [2011]  evaluated  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  Mircera  in  the  management  of  anemia  in  paediatric  patients  on  stable  peritoneal 
dialysis  receiving  EPO  twice-a-week  who  converted  to  subcutaneous  Mircera,  scheduled  every  2  weeks. 
The  follow-up  was  6  months.  The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  Hb  >11  g/dL.  Sixteen  paediatric 
patients aged 2-14 years, including 11 boys, participated in the study. The target Hb level was attained 
by month 3 for all patients, with an increase in mean ( ±  SD) Mircera dose, given every 2 weeks, from 
0.86±0.33 to 1.67±0.4 μg/kg. No adverse events attributable to Mircera were reported. 
Wedekin et al [2011] conducted a 6-month study of Mircera administered intravenously every 4 weeks in 
12 patients (age 6–17 years) in a post-transplant setting (5 switched from darbepoetin and 7 were naïve 
to  erythropoietin).  The  median  Mircera  dose  was  2.5  μg/kg.  No  adverse  events  attributable  to  Mircera 
were reported and Hb levels were effectively controlled. 
For  comparison,  during  the  evaluation  period  of  study  NH19707,  the  median  [interquartile  range]  4-
weekly Mircera dose was similar (3.22 [2.25-5.12] μg/kg) in Group 2. 
2.3.  Rapporteur's discussion 
The safety information in paediatric patients aged 5-17 years of age mainly derived from Study NH19707,  
a  phase  II,  multicenter,  open-label,  dose  finding,  multiple  dose  study  where  paediatric  patients  on 
hemodialysis  and  clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anemia  who  previously  received  maintenance  treatment 
with  ESA  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa)  were  switched  to  Mircera.  Patients  received  Mircera 
administered  intravenously  once  every  4  weeks  for  20  weeks  (copre  study  period).  Patients  who 
completed this period with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 
g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period (total duration of treatment, up to 
73 weeks). 
After  the  first  administration  of  Mircera,  dose  adjustments  were  permitted  to  maintain  target  Hb  levels, 
which  were  measured  once  a  week  during  the  core  study  period  and  once  every  four  weeks  during  the 
safety extension. Two groups were enrolled, Group 1 with an intermediate conversion factor and Group 2

with a high conversion factor (for more information please see clinical efficacy section). 
In  addition,  the  clinical  safety  of  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  is  further  supported  by  analysis  of  post-
marketing  adverse  events  reports,  data  from  international  registries  recording  use  of  Mircera  in  this 
population and also with literature reports showing Mircera use in paediatric population. 
According to Study NH19707, a total of 64 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera (16 
patients in Group 1 and 48 patients in Group 2) and were used to assess safety during core study period. 
After this period, an additional 52-week safety extension period was planned. In this period thirty seven 
patients (9 in Group 1 and 28 in Group 2), slightly more than a half (58%) of those initially included in 
the core study period, met criteria to enter the safety extension period.  
During the whole study, patients were in the study for a total of 45.5 patients exposure year (PEY) with a 
mean of 0.7 PEY per patient. Nineteen patients were exposed to Mircera for at least 15 months.  
Safety  results  from  this  phase  II  study  showed  that  77%  and  73%  of  patients  in  the  core  period  and 
safety extension period reported at least one adverse event, respectively. These percentages seem lower 
than those obtained from pooled phase II/III trials conducted in adult patients with chronic renal anaemia 
where around 88% of patients reported at least one adverse event.  
During the core period adverse events reported in more than 5% of patients were nasopharyngitis (14%), 
headache  (14%),  vomiting  (9%),  hypertension  (13%),  abdominal  pain  (6%),  and  bronchitis  (6%).  The 
most frequently reported adverse events during the extension period were overall nasopharyngitis (19%), 
headache (16%), and hypertension (14%). 
One  death  was  reported  in  the  core  study  period,  due  to  intracranial  hematoma,  resulting  from  a 
domestic  head  trauma  and  subsequent  dialysis  with  heparin.  It  was  considered  by  the  investigator 
unrelated to the study drug.  
The adverse events considered related to treatment in paediatric patients (phase II study) were 7.8% in 
the core period and 5.4% in the extension period. For adult patients (pooled phase II/III trials) this data 
was around 6%. 
For  the  safety  assessment  the  MAH  considered  hypertension,  vascular  access  thrombosis  and  anti-
erythropoietin  antibody-induced  pure  red  cell  aplasia  (AEAB-PRCA)  as  potential  safety  concerns.  These 
adverse  events,  along  with  decrease  in  platelet  count  and  thromboembolic  events  (including  pulmonary 
embolism), were considered of special interest during the clinical development of Mircera in adult patients 
with chronic renal anaemia and are described as adverse events in Mircera product information. 
During the core period in Study NH19707 8 patients (12.5%) reported hypertension as adverse event, 7 
of  which  showed  hypertension  prior  to  inclusion  in  the  study.  The  other  one  had  previously  received 
antihypertensive therapy. Two of these cases reported (3.1%) were classified as serious adverse events, 
and not considered related to the study medication. In the safety extension period five patients (13.5%) 
reported  hypertension,  however  two  (5.4%)  was  classified  as  serious  and  not  related  to  the  study 
medication. 
Four patients reported vascular access thrombosis (2 patients (3.1%) described as thrombosis in device 
and  2  patients  (3.1%)  as  arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis.  All  cases  were  classified  as  serious  adverse 
events.  However  only  two  of  them  were  considered  related  to  the  study  medication  (one  case  each). 
During  the  safety  extension  period  arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis  and  thrombosis  in  device  were 
reported  in  2  patients  each  (5.4%).  Two  of  them  were  classified  as  serious  adverse  event  (one 
arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis  and  the  other  one  thrombosis  in  device)  and  none  of  them  was 
considered  related  to  the  study  drug.  No  thromboembolic  events  (i.e.  pulmonary  embolism)  have  been 
recorded.

No  patients  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  or  anti-erythropoietin  antibodies  during  Study  NH19707. 
Either pure red cell aplasia.  
In Study NH19707 platelet count decreased along core study period both in group 1 and 2 (normal range 
150-400x109/L).  Median  baseline  platelet  count  was  221.5x109/L  and  208.0x109/L  in  group  1  and  2, 
respectively.  No  median  platelet  data  at  the  end  of  the  core  period  has  been  provided  by  the  MAH. 
However, the MAH stated that in group 1 and 2,  1/16 patients and 19/47 patients had at least one post-
baseline values below the normal range, respectively. In group 2, 6/19 of patients who experienced low 
values  already  had  low  values  at  baseline.  In  addition  in  group  2,  4/47  patients  had  at  least  one  post-
baseline  values  above  normal  range  of  whom  1/4  had  high  values  at  baseline.  No  increase  in  platelet 
count is described in product information in adult patients. 
During the extension period platelet values below the normal range was reported in 2 patients in Group 1 
and in 15 patients in Group 2. 
No  bleeding  events  were  reported  in  any  patient  who  had  post-baseline  platelet  counts  below  normal 
range.  During  both  periods  thrombocitopenia  was  reported  overall  in  4  patients  and  was  classified  mild 
and unrelated to the study drug.  
In  addition  to  the  safety  data  derived  from  Study  NH19707,  the  MAH  has  provided  data  from 
postmarketing surveillance, International registries and data from literature. According to these sources it 
seems that safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population does not reveal any new signal. 
Regarding the safety results provided by study NH19707, no new safety adverse events were identified. 
It  seems  that  adverse  events  described  in  paediatric  patients  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  adult 
patients with chronic renal anaemia. However, due to the phase II study design no comparison between 
adverse  events  observed  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  can  be  made  and  the  MAH  did  not  compare 
these  safety  data  with  the  ones  already  available  in  adults.  Therefore  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn 
regarding the  possible  difference  in  frequencies of  the  above  described  adverse  events.  For this  reason, 
the  need  to  include  in  the  future  any  particular  information  for  paediatric  population  in  the  product 
information  will  be  decided  when  the  entire  evidence  is  available  and  following  a  careful  review  of  the 
whole  data  without  any  restrictions  based  on  arbitrary  cut-off  points  (i.e  only  AEs>2%  or  5%  of 
incidence) as previously stated in the P46 procedure. 
Finally the MAH is in agreement and decided not to amend the product information at this point. 
Finally,  and  according  to  information  coming  from  non-clinical  studies  related  to  other  PEGylated 
products, there is a possible risk of accumulation of PEG causing vacuolation in tissues such as brain and 
kidney as seen in animals. The implication of this finding in humans is at the time being unclear. An up-
to-date  discussion  on  safety  aspects  related  to  this  issue  is  expected  in  case  that  an  extension  of 
indication for the inclusion of the paediatric population is claimed in the future.

• 
In the absence of a therapeutic indication covering children, the inclusion of efficacy data in this 
population in section 5.1. of the SmPC is not justified. 
PK data need to be completed with the ones from the ongoing NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies, a 
agreed in the PIP, before deciding the information to be included in section 5.2. Moreover, such data 
proposed are based on a conversion factor that will need to be further justified.  
The SmPC sections should remain unchanged for the time being.

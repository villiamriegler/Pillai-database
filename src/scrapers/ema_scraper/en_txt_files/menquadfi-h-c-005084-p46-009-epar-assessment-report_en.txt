Description
MET33 is a phase III, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-centre study to 
describe the immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose immunisation schedule of MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine or a 4-dose immunisation schedule of a licensed quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 
(Menveo) when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines (Prevnar 13, Hexacima, 
RotaTeq, and M-M-RII) in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in Mexico, and to describe 
the immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose immunisation schedule of MenACYW conjugate vaccine 
when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines (Prevnar 13®, Pentaxim®, 
EMA/59046/2024
Page 4/42
ENGERIX-B®, and MMR) in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in the Russian 
Federation.
MET33 was conducted at 11 centres that enrolled participants in The Russian Federation (8 centres) 
and The United Mexican States (Mexico) (3 centres).
MET33 that was conducted between 17 October 2018 (first subject first visit) and 18 February 2022 
(last subject last visit).
Methods
Study participants
A total of 525 subjects were planned to be enrolled. Approximately 300 healthy, meningococcal 
vaccine naïve infants aged 2 months were randomised in a 2:1 ratio in Mexico, and 225 healthy, 
meningococcal-vaccine naïve infants aged 2 months were randomised in a 2:1 ratio in the Russian 
Federation.
Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or guardian(s), as required by local 
regulations.
The study population included healthy infants born after a full-term pregnancy, 60 to 89 days of age 
on the day of the first study visit. 
Subjects were excluded from study enrolment if they participated in another clinical trial up to 4 weeks 
preceding the first trial vaccination; if they received any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial 
vaccination (except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at a gap of at least 2 weeks 
before or 2 weeks after any study vaccination); if previously vaccinated against meningococcal 
disease, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, poliovirus, rotavirus, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, measles, mumps, rubella, and / or varicella (for Mexico: More than 1 
previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine); if they had a history of infection with Neisseria meningitidis or 
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and /or rotavirus infection/disease; if they 
received immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products since birth; if they have known or 
suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency or received immunosuppressive therapy; if they 
had blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphoma of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the 
bone marrow or lymphatic systems or active tuberculosis; if they had a history of any neurologic 
disorder (seizures, progressive neurologic disorders, Guillain-Barré syndrome); if they had a known 
systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or to latex, or history of a life-threatening 
reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances; if 
the subject reported thrombocytopenia contraindicating IM vaccination in the Investigator’s; if they 
had a bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, 
contraindicating IM vaccination in the Investigator’s opinion; if they received oral or injectable 
antibiotic therapy within 72 hours of the first blood draw.

 Occurrence, nature (MedDRA preferred term), time of onset, duration, seriousness criteria, 
relationship to vaccination, outcome, and whether the event led to early termination from the 
study, of SAEs (including AESIs) throughout the trial from D0 to the last study visit.
Collection of Safety Data
All subjects were followed for safety from Visit 1 to the last study visit.

All subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination under the supervision of a 
responsible healthcare professional at each study site and any unsolicited systemic AEs 
occurring during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited systemic AEs in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).

The subject’s parent / guardian recorded information in a diary card about solicited injection-
site reactions and solicited systemic reactions from D0 to D7 after each vaccination and 
unsolicited AEs were recorded from D0 after each vaccination until the subject returns for the 
next study visit.

Serious AEs (including AEs of special interest [AESIs]) were recorded in a diary card 
throughout the study. The subject’s parent / guardian was asked to notify the site immediately 
about any potential SAEs at any time during the trial.

A member of the study staff contacted subject’s parent / guardian by telephone 8 days (+2 
days) after each vaccination visit to identify the occurrence of any SAE (including AESIs) that 
had not yet been reported and reminded him/her to complete the diary card after each 
vaccination visit, and to bring it back to the next study visit.

The completed diary cards were collected and reviewed with the subject’s parent / guardian at 
subsequent visits.
A member of the study staff contacted the subject’s parent / guardian by telephone 14 days (+2 
days) before the first study visit of the subject’s second year of life to identify the occurrence of any 
SAE that had not yet been reported and reminded him/her to complete the diary card and to next 
study visit so it could be reviewed at the study site.
Sample size
The sample size of this study was chosen to provide immunogenicity and safety data; it is not intended 
for the purposes of hypothesis testing. No formal sample size calculation was performed.
Though there are no statistically powered hypotheses, the overall study cohort (n=525) will provide a 
probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 0.57%. The overall 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine cohort (n=350) will provide a probability of approximately 95% of 
observing any AE with a true incidence of 0.85%. In treatment arm with n=200, there is a probability 
of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 1.5%. In treatment arm with 
n=150, there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 2%.
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Randomisation
On the day of enrollment, subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and whose parent / 
guardian signs the ICF will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio in Mexico, and in a 2:1 ratio in the 
EMA/59046/2024
Page 11/42
Russian Federation such that Group 1 will have 200 subjects, Group 2 will have 100 subjects, Group 3 
will have 150 subjects, and Group 4 will have 75 subjects.
Site staff will connect to the IRT system, enter the identification and security information, and 
confirm a minimal amount of data in response to IRT-system prompts. The IRT system will then 
provide the vaccine assignment and subject number. The full detailed procedures for Group 
allocation are described in the Operating Guidelines. If a subject who has enrolled is not eligible to 
participate in the study, then the subject’s information will only be recorded on the subject- 
recruitment log.
Subject numbers that are assigned by the IRT system will consist of a 12-digit string (a 3-digit 
country identifier, a 4-digit study centre identifier, and a 5-digit subject identifier). For example, 
Subject 840000100005 is the fifth subject enrolled in Centre Number 1 in the US (840 being the US 
country code).
Subject numbers should not be reassigned for any reason. The randomisation codes will be kept 
securely in the IRT system.
Blinding 
This trial is open-label; therefore, there is no need for code-breaking procedures. Until database lock 
and to prevent biases, the laboratory personnel performing the serology testing will be blinded to the 
group assignment. The laboratory will have a written procedure detailing how the blinding will be 
maintained.
Changes Following Study Unblinding/Database Lock and Post hoc Analyses:
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted on the immunogenicity data from Group 3 subjects at 
30 days after the last MenACYW conjugate vaccine administration [post-dose 3 at 12 months of age] 
timepoint. This was due to the identification of unusual immunogenicity results at one of the Group 3 
sites in the Russian Federation after conducting the hSBA analysis on the PPAS and FAS. The immune 
response to Meningococcal A, C, W, and Y serogroups in terms of percentage of subjects with 
seroprotective antibody titers and GMTs measured by hSBA at site no. 6431007 were more than 10-
fold lower compared to the results at other sites in the Russian Federation and in Mexico.
Therefore, immunogenicity results at this site 30 days after last vaccination were excluded in the post-
hoc analysis to assess its impact.
Statistical Methods
Data were summarized descriptively. No hypotheses were tested.

Efficacy results
1. Primary objective 
Meningococcal hSBA Seroprotection rates (antibody titer ≥ 1:8) in Mexico and the 
Russian Federation after last vaccination in the second year of life

vaccination in the second year of life – Per-Protocol Analysis Set 2 
Sensitivity Post hoc Analysis
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted on the immunogenicity data from Group 3 
subjects at 30 days after the last MenACYW conjugate vaccine administration [post-dose 3 at 
12 months of age] timepoint. This was due to the identification of unusual immunogenicity 
results at one of the Group 3 sites in the Russian Federation after conducting the hSBA 
analysis on the PPAS and FAS. The immune response to Meningococcal A, C, W, and Y 
serogroups in terms of percentage of subjects with seroprotective antibody titers and GMTs

measured by hSBA at site no. 6431007 were more than 10-fold lower compared to the results 
at other sites in the Russian Federation and in Mexico.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
MET33 was a phase III, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-centre study 
planned to descriptively compare the immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose immunisation schedule of 
MenACYW (Group1: MenACYW + paediatric vaccines) and a 4-dose immunisation schedule of the 
comparator meningococcal conjugate vaccine Menveo (Group2: Menveo + paediatric vaccines) when 
administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines (Prevnar 13, Hexacima, RotaTeq, and M-
M-RII) in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in Mexico, and to describe the 
immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose immunisation schedule of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when 
administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines (Group3: MenACYW + paediatric vaccines 
and Group4: paediatric vaccines only; Prevnar 13, Pentaxim, ENGERIX-B, and MMR) in healthy infants 
and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in the Russian Federation. Hence, a control group for meningococcal 
vaccination in the Russian Federation is lacking. MenACYW was administered at 2, 6 and 12 months of 
age. Menveo was administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. It is critically noted that no 
hypotheses testing was planned for the study and that the study followed an open label design, which 
might influence the reporting of safety events.
Menveo is currently approved in the EU only from the age of 2 years. At submission of the planned 
type II variation, the MAH should discuss the use of Menveo as comparator vaccine. Furthermore, at 
the time of variation submission the MAH should justify a possible extrapolation of the concomitant 
vaccines and schedules used to the European situation (available vaccines and recommended 
vaccination schedules in the EU).
A total of 300 subjects were enrolled and randomised in Mexico and 190 subjects were enrolled and 
randomised in the Russian Federation: 200 subjects were enrolled from Mexico and randomised to 
Group 1, 100 subjects were enrolled from Mexico and randomised to Group 2, 150 subjects were 
enrolled from the Russian Federation and randomised to Group 3, and 75 subjects were enrolled from 
the Russian Federation and randomised to Group 4. The overall ratio of male/female subjects was 0.95 
in Mexico and 0.92 in the Russian Federation which is acceptable. The mean age (±SD) of subjects 
enrolled in Mexico was 67.1 (±7.37) days [range: 60 to 90 days]; 72.8 (±8.57) days [range: 60 to 93 
days] in the Russian Federation. Hence, the mean age of subjects was comparable between Mexico 
and the Russian Federation. Of note, the ethnical/geographical origin of subjects varied between the 2 
countries. In Mexico (Groups 1 and 2), most of the subjects (81.3%) enrolled were American Indian or 
of Alaskan Native. The racial origin for the remaining 18.7% subjects was not reported. In the Russian 
Federation (Groups 3 and 4), all subjects enrolled were White. The possible impact of distinct HLA 
backgrounds of the native American (Mexico) and White (Russian Federation) individuals as well as the 
possible impact of geographic differences in serotype distribution on study outcomes should be 
discussed in the planned Variation. 
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity data for meningococcal and routine pediatric vaccines were presented descriptively. 
The primary objectives were to describe the vaccine seroprotection to the antigens present in 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) or Menveo (Group 2) when administered concomitantly with 
routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico and to describe the vaccine 
EMA/59046/2024
Page 35/42
seroprotection following MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 3) when administered concomitantly with 
routine paediatric vaccines in the Russian Federation. Primary endpoints were meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, Y, and W antibody titres ≥ 1:8 measured by hSBA, assessed at 30 days after the last 
vaccination in the second year of life with MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1 and 3) or Menveo 
(Group 2).
In Mexico, the percentages of subjects with hSBA antibody titres ≥1:8 at D30 after the last dose were 
97.6% for serogroup A, 99.2% for serogroup C, 100.0% for serogroups Y and W in Group 1 (MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine) and 95.0% for serogroup A, 93.3% for serogroup C, 100.0% for serogroups Y and 
W in Group 2 (Menveo vaccine). In the Russian Federation, the percentages of subjects with hSBA 
antibody titres ≥1:8 were 89.6% for serogroup A, 82.3% for serogroup C, 80.2% for serogroups Y and 
W in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 3). 
Hence, the majority subjects showed seroprotection after MenACYW conjugate vaccine (in Mexico and 
the Russian Federation) or Menveo vaccine (in Mexico) in the second year of life with overall 
comparable responder rates between vaccines. According to MAH´s post hoc sensitivity analysis, the 
lower immunogenicity in the Russian Federation is mainly derived from study site no. 6431007. 
Reasons for the additional analysis with site exclusion were observed differences in seroprotection 
rates and GMTs with around 10-fold lower results compared to all other study sites. The analysis 
excluding the Russian Federation site no. 6431007 showed a higher percentage of subjects with hSBA 
titres ≥ 1:8, similar to the results observed in Group 1 in Mexico. The additional insight provided by 
this sensitivity analysis is acknowledged, but the exclusion of site no. 6431007 is not sufficiently 
justified to conclude on immunogenicity based on this sensitivity analysis. 
Regarding the secondary objectives, at D30 after the last vaccination in the infant series at 6 months 
of age, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse (i.e. for a subject with a pre-vaccination titre < 1:8, the post-
vaccination titre must be >= 1:16; for a subject with a pre-vaccination titre >= 1:8, the post-
vaccination titre must be at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titre) in Mexico was higher in 
subjects who received 2 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) than in subjects who received 
3 doses of Menveo vaccine (Group 2) for serogroups A (84.7% vs 58.0%) and C (100.0% vs 86.4%) 
and was comparable for serogroups W (98.3% vs 97.5%) and Y (99.4% vs 92.6%) in both groups. In 
the Russian Federation (Group 3), the seroresponse after MenACYW conjugate vaccine was slightly 
lower (compared to Mexico) with 70.1% for serogroup A, 94.8% for serogroup C, 87.6% for serogroup 
Y, and 93.8% for serogroup W, reminiscent of results with the primary endpoint and hSBA GMTs.
At D30 after the last vaccination in the second year of life, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse in Mexico 
was overall comparable between subjects who received 2 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 
1) and subjects who received 3 doses of Menveo vaccine (Group 2) for serogroups A (96.8% vs 
85.0%), C (99.2% vs 88.3%), Y (100% vs 96.7%), and W (99.2% vs 100%). Hence, the seroresponse 
following the MenACYW vaccine overall increased slightly after vaccination in the second year of life 
compared to 6 months of age in Mexico. In the Russian Federation, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse 
was lower (A: 74.0%, C: 81.3%, Y: 80.2% and W: 79.2%) at D30 after the last vaccination in the 
second year of life compared to Mexico. Furthermore, the seroresponse in the Russian Federation was 
lower in the second year of life compared to 6 months of age which is somewhat unexpected. 
In Mexico, hSBA GMTs for all 4 serogroups were higher than at baseline (D0) at D30 after the last 
vaccination of the infant series with either vaccine. The hSBA GMTs were higher in Group 1 (MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine; A: 71.7, C: 626, Y: 246 and W:340) compared to the Group 2 (Menveo; A: 16.7, 
C: 62.4, Y: 59.8 and W: 95.7). Also, at D30 after the last vaccination in the second year of life, the 
hSBA GMTs for all serogroups in Group 1 were higher than in Group 2 (A: 145 vs 65.5, C: 897 vs 77, 
Y: 401 vs 228 and W: 639 vs 242). In the Russian Federation, the hSBA GMTs for all 4 serogroups 
EMA/59046/2024
Page 36/42
were higher than at baseline at D30 after the last vaccination in the infant series. At D30 after the last 
vaccination in the second year of life, the hSBA GMTs were lower compared to results for group 1 and 
lower compared to group 2 for serogroups Y and W, but higher compared to group 2 for serogroups A 
and C (A: 85.4, C: 214, Y: 97.3 and W: 123). With respect to seroresponse and GMTs it is concluded 
that 3 vaccinations of MenQuadfi until 12 months of age appear to induce a stronger response in 
antibody titres compared to 4 vaccinations of Menveo in the same time frame and in a comparable 
population. The interpretation of responses in group 3 are compromised by the lack of a direct 
comparator but appear lower compared to the same age group in Mexico. It can be speculated whether 
genetic predisposition of study participants and/or geographic differences in serotype distribution 
across study sites could have an influence on study outcomes.
The immunogenicity profiles of the investigated routine paediatric vaccines (Prevnar13, RotaTeq, 
Hexacima, MMR, Pentaxim, and ENGERIX-B) were overall comparable when co-administered with a 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menveo vaccine or when administered alone (after the infant series 
and in the second year of life) in Mexico and the Russian Federation. For instance, MMR vaccination 
response rates at D30 after vaccination in the second year of life for Groups 1 and 2 in Mexico were 
Measles: 99.2% vs 100%, Mumps: 100% vs 96.6% and Rubella: 100% vs 100%. In the Russian 
Federation (Groups 3 and 4), responder rates were Measles: 93.8% vs 88.0%, Mumps: 89.6% vs 
90.0% and Rubella: 95.8% vs 94.0%. 
According to the CSR, Prevnar13 was administered in all groups 1-4. However, no immunogenicity 
data on Prevnar13 from the Russian Federation (Groups 3 and 4) were found in the current CSR. If 
possible, these data should be provided with the planned Variation since the comparison: MenACYW + 
Prevnar13 vs Prevnar13 alone is considered of interest for the investigation of this concomitant 
vaccination.
Safety
The observational safety objectives were to describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine 
and Menveo when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and 
toddlers in Mexico (Group 1 vs Group 2) and the Russian Federation (Group 3) and to describe the 
safety profile of routine pediatric vaccines in Mexico (Groups 1 and 2) and the Russian Federation 
(Groups 3 and 4). 
Immediate unsolicited systemic AEs were collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination. Other 
unsolicited AEs were evaluated up to D30 after each vaccination. Solicited AE information (injection 
site reactions and systemic reactions) were collected from D0 to D07 after each vaccination. SAEs and 
AESIs were collected throughout the study. These measurements are considered appropriate. The 
discussion on safety data below refers to the overall safety analysis set. Individual safety analysis sets 
at 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 6 and 12 months of age will not be discussed in detail, as data do not refer to a 
licensed population (all subjects are below 12 years of age, have received at least two meningococcal 
vaccinations against serogroups A, C, Y and W before the age of 12 months or have not received any 
meningococcal vaccinations against serogroups A, C, Y and W during the study) and the submission in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, does not address any 
extension of the current indication for MenQuadfi to vaccinate healthy infants. It is further critically 
noted that the study followed an open label design, which might influence the reporting of safety 
events.
Mexico
The safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine was roughly comparable to that of Menveo when 
administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines, but the rate of reporting was mostly 
EMA/59046/2024
Page 37/42
higher for group 1 compared to group 2, except for grade 3 events, which were reported more 
frequently by subjects that have received Menveo. For instance, the percentages of subjects who 
reported at least 1 solicited reaction within 7 days after vaccination were 89.5% (179/200) in Group 1 
and 76.8% (76/99) in Group 2, and 20.0% (40/200) in Group 1 and 21.2% (21/99) in Group 2 
reported at least 1 Grade 3 solicited reaction. The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 
solicited injection site reaction were 78.0% (156/200) in Group 1 and 69.7% (69/99) in Group 2, and 
12.0% (24/200) in Group 1 and 14.1% (14/99) in Group 2 reported at least one Grade 3 solicited 
injection site reaction. Specifically, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited 
injection site reaction at the MenACYW/Menveo injection site were 64.5% (129/200) and 63.6% 
(63/99), respectively. Also the safety profile of solicited injection site reactions after routine paediatric 
vaccines was roughly comparable between vaccine groups, but with slightly higher frequencies in 
group 1. For instance, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site 
reaction at the Prevnar13 vaccine site were 67.0% (134/200) in Group 1 and 59.6% (59/99) in Group 
2. The most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions after MenACYW in Group 1 were 
injection site tenderness reported by 60.5% (121/200) of subjects followed by injection site erythema 
(26.0% [52/200] of subjects) and injection site swelling (12.0% [24/200] of subjects)  Similarly, after 
Menveo the most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions in Group 2 were also injection 
site tenderness, reported by 60.6% (60/99) of subjects followed by injection site erythema (13.1% 
[13/99] of subjects) and injection site swelling (9.1%[9/99] of subjects). Hence, erythema occurred 
about twice as frequently after MenACYW compared to Menveo, which should be anticipated for 
subjects following the depicted vaccination strategy with MenQuadfi, compared to the scheme with 
Menveo in group 2. For either vaccine most of the injection site reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and 
resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence. 
Comparable to the pattern for reported frequencies for local reactions, the percentages of subjects 
reporting at least one solicited systemic reaction were 81.5% (163/200) in Group 1 and 70.7% 
(70/99) in Group 2, and 11.5% (23/200) in Group 1 and 12.1% (12/99) in Group 2 reported at least 
one Grade 3 solicited systemic reaction. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions were 
irritability, reported by 67.0% (134/200) of subjects in Group 1 and 58.6% (58/99) subjects in Group 
2 followed by abnormal Crying (58.5% [117/200] in Group 1 and 50.5% (50/99) in Group 2). Fever 
(42.2% [84/199] subjects in Group 1 and 33.7% [33/98] subjects in Group 2), drowsiness (40.0% 
[80/200] subjects in Group 1 and 36.4% [36/99] subjects in Group 2), lost appetite (36.0% [72/200] 
subjects in Group 1 and 33.3% [33/99] subjects in Group 2), and vomiting (19.5% [39/200] subjects 
in Group 1 and 11.1% [11/99] subjects in Group 2) were also commonly reported and all with a mildly 
higher frequency for group 1. The percentages of subjects reporting at least one Grade 3 solicited 
systemic reaction were 11.5% (23/200) in Group 1 and 12.1% (12/99) in Group 2. Most of the 
solicited systemic reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence. 
Taken together, solicited systemic reactions occurred numerically more often after MenACYW 
compared to Menveo. For the overall safety analysis set is to be noted that subjects in group 2 
received 1 additional vaccination (with Menveo at 4 months of age) compared to subjects in group 1, 
which might have an effect on reporting rates. Thus, it can be concluded that MenQuadfi appears 
slightly more reactogenic compared to Menveo in infants and toddlers, which might be related to the 
total lower content of Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharide and/or the difference in conjugated 
proteins (tetanus toxoid carrier protein for MenQuadfi and Corynebacterium diphtheriae CRM 197 
protein for Menveo).
No immediate unsolicited AEs or ARs were recorded within 30 minutes of any vaccination in any group.

The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE (between D0 and D30) was 
comparable between Group 1 and Group 2 (49.8% in Group 1 and 47.5% in Group 2). Unsolicited non-
serious AEs were mainly reported in the following SOCs: “Infections and Infestations” (43.3% 
[87/201]; mainly nasopharyngitis), “Gastrointestinal Disorders” (8.0% [16/201]; mainly diarrhoea), 
and “General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions” (7.0% [14/201]; mainly injection site 
haematoma) in Group 1 and “Infections and Infestations” (34.3% [34/99]; mainly nasopharyngitis), 
“General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions” (17.2% [17/99]; mainly injection site 
haematoma), and “Gastrointestinal Disorders” (12.1% [12/99]; mainly diarrhoea) in Group 2. The 
percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AE was 3.0% (6/201) 
in Group 1. No subjects in Group 2 reported any Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AEs. The percentage 
of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR (between D0 and D30) was comparable 
between Group 1 (2.0% [4/201]) and Group 2 (2.0% [2/99]). All unsolicited non-serious ARs were 
Grade 1 or Grade 2. Most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs lasted for up to 7 days. Unsolicited non-
serious ARs were mainly reported in the SOC “General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions” in 
both groups (2.0% [4/201] in Group 1 and 2.0% [2/99] in Group 2; mainly injection site haemorrhage 
and injection site haematoma). No concerns arise from reported unsolicited ARs.
No deaths were reported in the Mexican cohort. No subjects in Groups 1 or 2 were discontinued from 
the study due to an AE. However, seven subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the study period: 
2.0% (4/201) subjects in Group 1 and 3.0% (3/99) subjects in Group 2. The SAEs in Group 1 were 
seizure (1), pneumonia (2) and Head injury (1). The SAEs in Group 2 were bronchiolitis (2) and febrile 
seizure (1). Hence, respiratory tract infections were the most frequent SAE in both groups. The 
percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 AESI were 0.5% (1/201; grade 3 seizures) in Group 1 
and 1.0% (1/99; grade 3 febrile convulsions) in Group 2. None of the SAEs or AESIs was considered 
related to vaccination, which is reassuring and can be followed based on provided narratives. A total of 
190 (95.0%) subjects in Group 1 and 92 (92.0%) subjects in Group 2 completed the study, indicating 
a high and comparable vaccination acceptance for MenACYW and MENVEO vaccines.
Russian Federation
The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited reaction were 42.7% (64/150) in Group 3 
and 45.3% (34/75) in Group 4, and 0.7% (1/150) in Group 3 reported at least 1 Grade 3 solicited 
reaction. No Grade 3 solicited reaction was reported in Group 4. 
The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were 22.0% 
(33/150) in Group 3 and 16.0% (12/75) in Group 4. No Grade 3 injection site reactions were reported 
in Groups 3 and 4. The percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction 
at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine site was 11.4% (17/149). The percentages of subjects who 
reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction after a routine paediatric vaccine were similarly low 
but comparable between Groups 3 and 4 (e.g. Prevnar13 vaccine site: 8.7% [13/150] vs 10.7% 
[8/75]). The most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions after MenACYW in Group 3 were 
injection site erythema, reported by 7.4% (11/149) of subjects followed by injection site tenderness 
(6.0% [9/149] of subjects) and injection site swelling (4.0% [6/149] of subjects). Most of the injection 
site reactions resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence.
The percentages of subjects reporting at least one solicited systemic reaction were 34.0% (51/150) in 
Group 3 and 38.7% (29/75) in Group 4, and 0.7% (1/150) in Group 3 reported at least one Grade 3 
solicited systemic reaction. No Grade 3 systemic reactions were reported in Group 4. The most 
frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in Group 3 were drowsiness, reported by 22.0% 
(33/150) subjects followed by irritability that was reported by 21.3% (32/150) of subjects. The most 
frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in Group 4 were irritability, reported by 26.7% (20/75) 
EMA/59046/2024

subjects followed by drowsiness (22.7% [17/75] of subjects). Lost Appetite (17.3% [26/150] subjects 
in Group 3 and 14.7% [11/75] subjects in Group 4), abnormal crying (12.0% [18/150] subjects in 
Group 3 and 8.0% [6/75] subjects in Group 4), and fever (7.4% [11//149] subjects in Group 3 and 
8.0% [6/75] subjects in Group 4) were also common. Most of the solicited systemic reactions resolved 
within 1-3 days of occurrence. Hence, overall comparable safety profiles were observed for Groups 3 
and 4.
No immediate unsolicited AEs or ARs were recorded within 30 minutes of any vaccination in any group.
The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE was comparable between 
Group 3 and Group 4 (10.0% [15/150] in Group 3 and 8.0% [6/75] in Group 4). All the unsolicited 
non-serious AEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. Unsolicited non-serious AEs were mainly reported in the 
following SOCs: “Infections and Infestations” (6.0% [9/150] subjects in Group 3 and 5.3% [4/75] 
subjects in Group 4; mainly rhinitis) and “Gastrointestinal Disorders” (2.7% [4/150] subjects in Group 
3 and 2.7% [2/75] subjects in Group 4). There were no unsolicited non-serious ARs reported in Groups 
3 and 4 within 30 days after vaccine injection. 
No deaths were reported in the Russian cohort. No subjects in Groups 3 or 4 were discontinued from 
the study due to an AE. Six subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the study period: 2.7% (4/150) 
subjects in Group 3 and 2.7% (2/75) subjects in Group 4. The SAEs in Group 3 were viral enterocolitis 
(2), atonic seizure (1) and COVID-19 (1). Hence, infections and seizures were reported as most 
frequent SAEs after MenACYW as for the Mexican cohort. The SAEs in Group 4 were bone fracture (1) 
and pneumonia (1). The percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 AESI was 0.7% (1/150) in 
Group 3 (grade 1 atonic seizure). None of the SAEs or AESIs was considered related to vaccination 
which is reassuring and can be followed based on provided narratives. A total of 148 (98.7%) subjects 
in Group 3 and 75 (100.0%) subjects in Group 4 completed the study, indicating a high vaccination 
acceptance.
Of note, the observed frequency of AEs reported in the Russian Federation was generally substantially 
lower than in Mexico. According to the MAH´s literature analysis, this pattern can be regularly 
observed in clinical studies of paediatric vaccines in the Russian Federation, which is acknowledged. 
However, reasons for this discrepancy are not entirely clear.
Overall, the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine as evaluated in study MET33 yielded no 
significant or unexpected safety concerns in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in 
Mexico and the Russian Federation.
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation
The study population of MET33 is not covered by the EU Marketing Authorisation of MenQuadfi, which 
is currently indicated from the age of 12 months and older. 
The purpose of MET33 was to demonstrate that the safety profile and immunogenicity of the 3-dose 
series of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (MenQuadfi) is similar to that of a 4-dose series of Menveo when 
starting immunisation at 2 months of age and administered concomitantly with routine paediatric 
vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico, and to demonstrate that the safety profile and 
immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine is similar when given concomitantly with routine 
paediatric vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers in the Russian Federation. It is critically noted 
that the study design does not address any possible consequence of the concomitant vaccination with 
routine paediatric vaccines on the immunogenicity profile of MenQuadfi (i.e., MenQuadfi alone vs. 
MenQuadfi + routine vaccines). One study arm with a sequential administration of MenQuadfi and 
EMA/59046/2024
Page 40/42
routine vaccines (that would still allow to provide the routine vaccination to all children) could have 
provided further insight in this aspect. However, the adequacy of the study design to investigate the 
appropriateness of concomitant vaccination will need to be assessed in the intended future application.
The submitted results of study MET33 comprised descriptive immunogenicity data for MenQuadfi, the 
comparator vaccine Menveo and concomitant paediatric vaccines as well as safety data sets 
summarizing AEs that occurred during the study. Overall, MenQuadfi showed a slightly higher 
immunogenicity than Menveo. Routine paediatric vaccines showed comparable immunogenicity when 
administered concomitantly with MenQuadfi or Menveo in healthy infants and toddlers. The safety 
profile of MenQuadfi was roughly comparable to Menveo. However, it is critically noted that no 
hypotheses testing was planned for the study and that the study followed an open label design, which 
might influence the reporting of safety events.
The adequacy of Menveo as comparator vaccine is questionable as Menveo is not licensed for the 
respective age group in the EU. This aspect requires further elaboration for any future variation 
application. Similarly, the use of administered concomitant vaccines should be justified based on EU 
standards (i.e., licensure of vaccines used and vaccine schedule). Furthermore, serious adverse events 
(especially those related to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections as well as seizures) should be 
discussed in detail once all data of the clinical program in subjects <12 years become available. 
Study MET33 is part of the MenQuadfi Paediatric Investigational Plan EMEA-001930-PIP01-16-M04). 
The MAH´s plan is to complete all the ongoing paediatric clinical studies MET33, MET41, MET42, 
MET52, MET58, MET61 covering 6 weeks to 12 months population prior to submit all the data together 
under a type II variation with Product Information update to support the extension of indication for use 
of MenQuadfi in individuals from the age of 6 weeks and older (planned submission Q1 2025 in the 
EU).

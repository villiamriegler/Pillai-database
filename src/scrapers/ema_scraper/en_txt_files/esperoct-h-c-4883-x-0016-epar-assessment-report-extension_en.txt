2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is a purified recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) product with a 40 kDa PEG 
conjugated to the protein. The PEG is attached to the O-linked glycan in the truncated B-domain of rFVIII 
(turoctocog alfa). The PEGylation increases the half-life of the protein.  
The mechanism of action for turoctocog alfa pegol is based on the replacement of the deficient or absent 
FVIII in patients with haemophilia A. When turoctocog alfa pegol is activated by thrombin at the site of 
injury, the pegylated truncated B-domain is cleaved off, generating activated FVIII (FVIIIa), which is similar 
in structure to native FVIIIa. Activated rFVIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX (FIX) on the surface of 
activated platelets and the complex catalyses the activation of factor X. By adding FVIII, the coagulation 
cascade can run uninterruptedly ensuring that the end product, fibrin, is generated and a haemostatic plug is 
formed.

Esperoct is currently marketed in five strengths (500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU). The 
turoctocog alfa pegol finished product is a lyophilised powder for reconstitution into a solution for injection for 
intravenous use.  
The Line Extension concerns the introduction of new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU) and the change is related 
solely to the finished product as only the amount of active substance is changing, while the excipients 
amount is the same as for the marketed strengths of Esperoct. 
2.2.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Esperoct is currently approved in five strengths (500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU). This 
extension of marketing authorisation concerns the addition of two new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU).  
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Esperoct is currently marketed in five strengths (500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU). The 
turoctocog alfa pegol finished product is a lyophilised powder for reconstitution into a solution for injection for 
intravenous use. The finished product is for single use administration. The lyophilised turoctocog alfa pegol 
finished product is reconstituted in 4.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution before use. The withdrawal volume 
is 4 mL. 
This Line Extension (LE) concerns the introduction of two new strengths (4000 IU and 5000 IU) and the 
change is related solely to the finished product as only the amount of active substance is changing, while the 
excipients amount is the same as for the marketed strengths of Esperoct. 
There is no change affecting the active substance (turoctocog alfa pegol) and it is the same active substance 
as the already marketed strengths of Esperoct. Moreover, for new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU) the finished 
product manufacturing process, the analytical procedures (validated), the device component and the 
container closure system (besides the cap colour) remain the same as approved for the marketed strengths 
of Esperoct. Based on the above, it has been agreed that a Notified Body opinion is not required for this LE. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is a purified recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) product with a 40 kDa PEG 
conjugated to the protein. The PEG is attached to the O-linked glycan in the truncated B-domain of rFVIII 
(turoctocog alfa). The PEGylation increases the half-life of the protein. The rFVIII (turoctocog alfa) active 
substance intermediate is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary host cells. The molecular mass of the 
turoctocog alfa pegol protein part is 166 kDa. The molecule consists of a heavy chain of 87 kDa and a light 
chain of 79 kDa held together by non-covalent interactions. The molecular mass of turoctocog alfa pegol is 
216 kDa including post-translational modifications and the PEG moiety.

The mechanism of action for turoctocog alfa pegol is based on the replacement of the deficient or absent 
FVIII in patients with haemophilia A. When turoctocog alfa pegol is activated by thrombin at the site of 
injury, the pegylated truncated B-domain is cleaved off, generating activated FVIII (FVIIIa), which is similar 
in structure to native FVIIIa. Activated rFVIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX (FIX) on the surface of 
activated platelets and the complex catalyses the activation of factor X. By adding FVIII, the coagulation 
cascade can run uninterruptedly ensuring that the end product, fibrin, is generated and a haemostatic plug is 
formed. PEGylation increases the half-life of the protein. 
There is no change affecting the active substance (turoctocog alfa pegol) and it is the same active substance 
as the already marketed strengths of Esperoct. The active substance is identical to the already approved 
active substance for Esperoct and the majority of the active substance module 2 and module 3 documents 
remain unchanged compared to documentation previously submitted and approved. Consequently, only those 
sections in the active substance part are briefly discussed where changes have been implemented. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
There are no changes to the section of the module. 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The description of the analytical procedure SE-HPLC (size exclusion-high-performance liquid chromatography) 
has been updated with the new strengths (4000-5000 IU) information. These amendments in the method 
description are acceptable and no concerns are raised. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
There are no changes to the section of the module. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
For the new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU) the finished product manufacturing process, the analytical 
procedures (validated), the device component and the container closure system (besides the cap colour) 
remain the same as approved for the marketed strengths of Esperoct. 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The turoctocog alfa pegol finished product is a lyophilised powder for reconstitution into a solution for 
injection for intravenous use. The finished product is for single use administration.  
The vial for the five product presentations of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product is a 5 mL vial made of 
type I glass, high hydrolytic resistance, in compliance with Ph. Eur., USP and JP. The lyophilised turoctocog 
alfa pegol finished product is reconstituted in 4.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution in a prefilled syringe 
before use. A vial adapter is provided for turoctocog alfa pegol finished product. It is a fluid transfer device 
that allows for the easy transfer of fluids. The vial adapter is a sterile, disposable device packed in a blister 
package.

The turoctocog alfa pegol finished product was developed in five strengths containing 500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 
IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU. The product line is now extended with two additional strengths containing 4000 IU 
and 5000 IU of turoctocog alfa. 
The composition of the turoctocog alfa pegol finished product is the same for the seven presentations (500 IU 
− 5000 IU) except for the content of the active substance.

The development of the additional 4000 IU and 5000 IU strengths have been appropriately addressed and 
the relevant sections in P.2 Pharmaceutical Development have been updated. No changes except the addition 
of the 4000 and 5000 IU/vial strengths have been implemented. Only the amount of active substance is 
changing, while the excipients amount is the same as for the marketed strengths of Esperoct. Moreover, for 
new strengths the device component, the container closure system (besides the cap colour) and the 
reconstitution diluent in a prefilled syringe remain the same as approved for the already marketed strengths 
of Esperoct.

The finished product manufacturing process for the 4000 and 5000 IU strengths has not changed. To further 
support the implementation of two new product strengths the stability data for the strengths 500 IU, 1000 
IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU are compared to data for the new strengths 4000 IU and 5000 IU. These data 
support the MAH’s conclusion that the development in degradation products is comparable for all batches. 
The batch release results for turoctocog alfa pegol new strengths (4000 IU - 5000 IU) finished product is all 
within the finished product specification. The results are also comparable across the seven strengths of 
turoctocog alfa pegol finished product, except for some test parameters which are different for each strength 
depending on the amount of active substance. It can be agreed that comparability of new strengths versus 
the initially approved strengths has been shown.  
With respect to the compatibility studies of reconstituted turoctocog alfa pegol finished product in contact 
with the vial adapter and in contact with the syringe for administration, the MAH justified, during the 
assessment, that a different behaviour of the protein solutions at the higher concentration is not expected. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The section ‘Manufacture’ has been appropriately addressed. The manufacturing facilities for production and 
quality control of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product formulated as 4000 IU and 5000 IU/vial strengths are 
the same as for the approved 500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU/vial strengths.  
The batch formula has been updated to include the 4000 IU and the 5000 IU strength, the composition is 
identical for all strengths except for the content of the active substance.  
The standard procedures for manufacturing of a lyophilised parenteral in the commercial facility comprises 
the consecutive sequence of processes for: 1) thawing of active substance, 2) compounding of finished 
product, 3) sterile filtration, 4) filling, 5) lyophilisation, 6) capping and 7) visual inspection. During the 
manufacturing process a series of process control (controls of process parameters and in-process test) with 
defined limits are performed to ensure the quality of the finished product. In summary, the finished product 
manufacturing process and its controls remains essentially unchanged except that the sampling strategy for 
quality control is changed and that the bioburden limits are changed. This is acceptable. In addition, a few 
editorial changes were made in this section.  
The turoctocog alfa pegol manufacturing process is already validated for the 500 IU - 3000 IU strengths in a 
batch size range. A full-scale manufacturing validation has been performed for the manufacturing process of 
turoctocog alfa pegol finished product with the two new strengths of 4000 IU and 5000 IU in the commercial 
facility licensed for commercial production. The full–scale manufacturing validation of 4000 IU - 5000 IU is 
supplemental to the existing validation resulting in a validation product range of 500 - 5000 IU in a batch size 
range based on identical manufacturing process and product sameness. Sameness applies to the 
manufacturing process and process design for turoctocog alfa pegol as all strengths have the same, excipient 
composition, manufacturing process and process controls, sterile filters, vial size and filling volume per vial, 
lyophilisation programme, and primary packaging and container closure system. 
Validation of 4000 IU and 5000 IU is performed and provides documented evidence that the process, when 
operated within the established parameters, can perform effectively and reproducible to produce product that 
meets the predetermined specifications and quality attributes.  
The sampling programme for the validation batches consisted of routine sampling for process control, release 
specification testing, and supplementary sampling to provide documentation of quality and chemical stability 
Assessment report  
EMA/358639/2023 
Page 9/16 
 
 
of finished product during compounding and during filling and to provide documented evidence of the product 
quality and batch uniformity after lyophilisation.  
All acceptance criteria have been fulfilled within the described limits for routine process controls and 
supplementary sampling.  
The results for the strengths 4000 IU and 5000 IU were comparable to the results for the strengths 500 IU - 
3000 IU. In summary, the MAH’s conclusion that the consecutive validation batches demonstrated a high 
level of process reproducibility and consistency both in terms of the routine process controls and the 
analytical results of the supplementary sampling programme can be agreed. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
No changes to the finished product specifications have been implemented except the updates with the new 
strengths. These updates for the 4000 IU and 5000 IU include strength-specific specification limits. These 
limits are based on the specification limits for the existing strengths and can be agreed on.  
Analytical procedures 
The analytical procedures are unchanged as the ones approved for the marketed strengths and have been 
validated for the new strengths. Supplementary validation was performed. This strategy is acceptable and 
agreed.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data obtained for the new strengths of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product batches, 4000 IU and 
5000 IU at release have been submitted.  
The batch release results for turoctocog alfa pegol new strengths (4000 IU - 5000 IU) finished product are all 
within the finished product specification and confirm that the finished product manufacturing process can 
manufacture finished product with the new, higher strengths consistently meeting its predetermined quality 
standards. 
A summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D is included in the 
dossier.  
Appropriate documentation on the conducted nitrosamine risk assessment has been provided. The MAH`s 
conclusion that no risk of presence of nitrosamines in the active substance and finished product has been 
identified is supported. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The MAH claims a shelf-life of 36 months at 2°C - 8°C, where the finished product may be kept at or below 
30°C for a single period up to 12 months or at or below 40°C for a single period up to 3 months for the new 
additional 4000 IU and 5000 IU strengths (for the unopened vial (before reconstitution). This shelf-life claim 
is identical to the shelf-life of the approved 500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU strengths. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/358639/2023 
Page 10/16 
 
 
 
 
addition, the MAH states that the in-use stability studies support a storage period of 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C or 
4 hours at maximum 30°C for the reconstituted finished product (4000 IU and 5000 IU strengths).  
PPQ finished product batches – 4000 IU and 5000 IU lots - have been put on stability. The stability study 
design includes evaluation of various storage conditions. 
Stability data from process performance qualification (PPQ) batches (500 IU – 3000 IU) are included for 
comparison. 
The present stability study includes data up to 6 months from 4000 IU and 5000 IU batches. The report 
covers results from the long-term and accelerated study. The stability study covers those attributes from the 
finished product specification that are susceptible to change during storage and which are likely to influence 
quality, safety and/or efficacy of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product.  
The available stability results from the 4000 IU and 5000 IU lots have been compared with the stability data 
from process performance qualification batches (500 IU – 3000 IU). This comparison indicates that the 
stability behaviour of the 4000 IU and 5000 IU lots is consistent with the currently documented trends 
observed for PPQ stability batches (500 IU – 3000 IU). 
Taking these arguments into account, the proposed shelf-life for the 4000 IU and 5000 IU can be agreed. 
Nonetheless, the MAH is recommended to continue and finalise the ongoing stability studies with the 4000 IU 
and 5000 IU lots according to the study design described and to notify the authorities in case of confirmed 
OOS during the long-term storage condition (Recommendation 1). 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
There are no changes to this section. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The MAH submitted a line extension of the marketing authorisation for Esperoct with the scope of introducing 
two new strengths (4000 IU and 5000 IU). The changes in the quality part are related primarily to the 
finished product as only the amount of active substance is changing, while the excipients amount is the same 
as for the marketed strengths of Esperoct.  
There is no change affecting the active substance (turoctocog alfa pegol) and it is the same active substance 
as the already marketed strengths of Esperoct. Moreover, for the new strengths the device component, the 
container closure system (besides the cap colour) and the reconstitution diluent in a prefilled syringe remain 
the same as approved for the marketed strengths of Esperoct.  
The development of the additional 4000 IU and 5000 IU strengths have been appropriately addressed; 
questions addressing the comparability evaluation (approved versus proposed additional strengths) as well as 
the compatibility studies of reconstituted finished product in contact with the vial adapter and in contact with 
the syringe for administration have been satisfactorily solved.  
The finished product manufacturing process remains essentially unchanged except that the sampling strategy 
for quality control is changed and that the bioburden limits are changed. In addition, a few editorial changes 
were made in this section. The turoctocog alfa pegol manufacturing process is already validated for the 500 
IU - 3000 IU strengths in a batch size range. A full-scale manufacturing validation has been performed for 
Assessment report  
EMA/358639/2023 
Page 11/16 
 
 
the manufacturing process of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product with the two new strengths of 4000 IU 
and 5000 IU in the manufacturing facility licensed for commercial production.  
The full–scale manufacturing validation of 4000 IU - 5000 IU is supplemental to the existing validation 
resulting in a validation product range of 500 - 5000 IU in a batch size range based on identical 
manufacturing process and product sameness. The MAH’s conclusion that the consecutive validation batches 
demonstrated a high level of process reproducibility and consistency both in terms of the routine process 
controls and the analytical results of the supplementary sampling programme can be agreed. No changes in 
the specifications have been implemented except the updates with the new strengths. These updates for the 
4000 IU and 5000 IU include strength-specific specification limits. These limits are based on the specification 
limits for the existing strengths and can be agreed on.  
The analytical procedures are unchanged as approved for the marketed strengths and have been validated 
for the new strengths. Supplementary validation was performed.  
Appropriate documentation of the conducted nitrosamine risk assessment has been included in the dossier. 
No risk of presence of nitrosamines in the active substance and finished product has been identified. 
In summary a well-established and appropriately updated Module 2 and 3 for the new additional finished 
product strengths has been submitted. From a quality perspective the new 4000 IU and 5000 IU strengths of 
Esperoct are approvable. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of these two new strengths (4000 IU and 5000 IU) is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
1. The MAH is recommended to continue and finalise the ongoing stability studies with the 4000 IU and 5000 
IU lots according to the study design described and to notify the authorities in case of confirmed OOS during 
the long-term storage condition.  
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This Line Extension concerns the introduction of new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU) and the change is related 
solely to the drug product as only the amount of drug substance is changing, while the excipients amount is 
the same as for the marketed strengths of Esperoct. 
There is no change affecting the drug substance (turoctocog alfa pegol) and it is the same drug substance as 
the already marketed strengths of Esperoct. Moreover, for new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU) the drug 
product manufacturing process, the analytical procedures (validated), the device component and the 
Assessment report

Page 12/16 
 
 
container closure system (besides the cap colour) remain the same as approved for the marketed strengths 
of Esperoct.

2.4.4.  Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Tolerance  
The proposed new strengths of 4000 and 5000 IU will result in concentrations of 1000 IU and 1250 IU/mL 
turoctocog alfa pegol, respectively. Local tolerance studies submitted for the initial marketing authorization 
include only concentrations of up to 500 IU/mL. In order to justify that the administered concentrations of 
1000 and 1250 IU/mL resulting from the proposed new strengths (4000 and 5000 IU) are covered by non-
clinical studies, the MAH referred to a single dose toxicity study that was submitted in the scope of the initial 
MAA dossier.  
In the single dose toxicity study 212344, rats received single i.v. administrations of 20000 and 25000 IU/kg 
at a concentration of 2000 IU/mL via the tail vein and no adverse reactions were observed. This corresponds 
to four times the concentration that was applied in the actual local tolerance study, which in addition included 
perivenous and intraarterial administration (all into the ear). The local reactions seen in these rats across all 
dose groups including controls were considered related to the intravenous administration. Although not 
exactly following recommendations for local tolerance studies the results of study 212344 are regarded 
sufficient in addition to the dedicated local tolerance study to cover the safety of the new intended clinical 
concentrations of 1000 and 1250 IU/mL.  
Upon request of one authority, a new local tolerance study with the highest concentration of 1250 IU/mL was 
conducted in New Zealand White Rabbits. The study report was not completed at the time of response 
submission, however, according to the MAH’s preliminary statement, no difference to control injection sites 
was observed. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to EMA guideline “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human 
use” substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from the 
guideline since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Turoctocog alfa pegol is a 
biological product consisting of a protein (rFVIII), coupled to polyethylene glycol (40 kDa) via a chemical 
linker (cytidin-5’-sialic acid-glycyl). The active pharmaceutical ingredient, rFVIII, and the chemical linker are 
due to their composition expected to be readily biodegradable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/358639/2023 
Page 13/16 
 
 
Polyethylene glycol (40 kDa) is not expected to be readily biodegradable but it is not hazard labelled 
according to the EU legislation and it has no known adverse effects to the environment. 
Thus, the proposed line extension for the new strengths of 4000 IU and 5000 IU is not expected to change 
the risk posed to the environment by Esperoct. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH did not submit additional non-clinical studies in support of the new strengths of 4000 IU and 5000 
IU turoctocog alfa pegol, which is in principal acceptable. A justification for the coverage of local tolerability of 
the resulting new concentrations, i.e. 1000 and 1250 IU/mL turoctocog alfa pegol, by existing studies was 
provided and is considered acceptable. In addition, a new local tolerance study was conducted in New 
Zealand White Rabbits for which the final study report was not available at the time of submission of the 
results, however, no adverse reactions were reported. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, turoctocog alfa pegol is not expected to change the risk posed 
to the environment. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No concerns are raised on the addition of the two new strengths on a non-clinical perspective.   
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
No new clinical data were submitted by the MAH to support this line extension, which intends to introduce 
vials containing 4,000 IU and 5,000 IU of turoctocog alfa pegol to the available palette of vials with 500 IU, 
1,000 IU, 1,500 IU, 2,000 IU and 3,000 IU. While the amount of protein is increased in the new drug 
products, the amount of excipients remains unchanged.  
In the clinical trial programme, only vials with 500 IU and 2,000 IU strength were investigated. 
The Guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 2) states that: If a factor VIII product should be marketed in different 
strengths leading to a broad range of factor VIII concentrations after reconstitution, the pharmacokinetics of 
the lowest and highest concentration should be investigated unless otherwise justified. 
The MAH was asked to justify that, even though the protein content in the highest strength vials is 10 times 
that of the lowest strength while the excipient content is identical, there is no clinically relevant concern 
regarding adsorption of the protein to the surfaces of the syringe and the tubing of the butterfly needle 
during preparation and administration of Esperoct. The MAH justified that a different behaviour of the protein 
solutions at the higher concentration is not expected. Consequently, the concern outlined was considered 
solved.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
The MAH refers to the positively tested user consultation results of the approved Esperoct presentations in 
February 2018. Only minor deviations from the already approved presentations were included.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This Line Extension concerns the introduction of two new strengths (4000 IU and 5000 IU) of Esperoct.  
The quality of the new strengths is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
No new non-clinical and clinical data have been provided which is considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the benefit-risk is considered positive for the addition of 4000 IU and 5000 IU strengths. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Esperoct is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Esperoct is not similar to Roctavian  within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance 
of Esperoct 4000 IU and 5000 IU is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency). Refixia can be used for all age groups. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Esperoct subject to the 
following conditions:

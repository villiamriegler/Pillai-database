Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 27 February 1998. 
During  its  meeting  on  21-22  April  1998,  the  CPMP  agreed  that  a  GMP  inspection  of  the 
manufacturing site was not necessary. 
The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 18 May 1998. 
The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  11  May 
1998. 
During its meeting on 23-25 June 1998, the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of questions 
to be sent to the company. The final consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 
25 June 1998. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 12 October 1998. 
The Rapporteur and the Co-Rapporteur circulated the joint assessment report on the company’s 
responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 26 November 1998. 
During its meeting on 15-17 December 1998, the CPMP agreed on a list of outstanding issues 
(inferior pregnancy rate, baby data of the cryopreservation programme, luteal support and effect 
duration,  stimulation  with  recombinant  FSH,  histamine  release,  and  SPC  wording)  to  be 
addressed by the company in an oral explanation. A hearing was held at the CPMP meeting on 
15 December 1998. 
The CPMP, during their meeting on 15-17 December 1998, considered the responses provided 
by the company and discussed the recommendations presented by the Rapporteur. Amendments 
were discussed to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet texts. 
The  applicant  provided  a  letter  of  undertaking  on  the  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  as 
requested by the CPMP (on remaining quality issues), dated 16 December 1998. 
During  the  meeting  on  15-17  December  1998,  the  CPMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data 
submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for 
granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Cetrotide  0.25  mg  and  3  mg  powder  and  solvent  for 
solution for injection on 17 December 1998. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 13 April 1999.

2.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
familial partial lipodystrophy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting approximately 0.2 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU), at the time the 
application was made; the sponsor has done an extensive literature search and has obtained 
written statements from several European experts to support the prevalence calculation; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to diabetes mellitus and other metabolic abnormalities 
which usually develop in adulthood, with women affected more severely than men. Marked 
hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis, and fatty liver can develop in some patients. 
Coronary artery disease and other types of atherosclerotic vascular disease are more prevalent in 
women. Acanthosis nigricans is relatively uncommon. Most affected women are able to reproduce 
normally, but some develop hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, suggestive of polycystic ovary 
syndrome. Some patients develop mild to moderate myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and conduction 
system abnormalities; 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the EU for patients 
affected by the condition.

2.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that familial partial lipodystrophy continues to be recognised as a distinct 
medical entity and still suitable as an orphan condition. 
Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is a group of usually autosomal dominant disorders characterized 
by loss of fat affecting the limbs, buttocks, and hips. Regional excess fat accumulation is frequent, 
varies by subtype, and may result in a Cushingoid appearance. Fat distribution is typically normal in 
early childhood, with loss of fat occurring around puberty. 
Muscular hypertrophy is common. Metabolic complications are common in adulthood, with increased 
risk of coronary heart disease and occasionally early cardiomyopathy. 
It is part of a broader group of disorders called the lipodystrophy syndromes. These are a 
heterogeneous group of rare disorders that have in common selective deficiency of adipose tissue in 
the absence of nutritional deprivation or catabolic state. Lipodystrophies are categorized based on 
aetiology (genetic or acquired) and distribution of lost adipose tissue, affecting the entire body 
(generalized) or only regions (partial). This yields four major categories: congenital generalized 
lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), 
and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL). 
The proposed condition continues to be a distinct medical entity as described in the original orphan 
designation.  
The approved therapeutic indication “Myalepta is indicated as an adjunct to diet as a replacement 
therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in lipodystrophy (LD) patients: 
•  with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised LD 
(Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above 
•  with confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in adults 
and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve 
adequate metabolic control.”  
falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication Familial Partial Lipodystrophy. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
This condition is frequently associated with hormonal and metabolic derangements resulting in severe 
comorbidities that depend on the subtype, extent of fat loss, age, and gender. Many complications of 
lipodystrophy are secondary to deficient adipose mass, resulting in ectopic lipid storage in the liver, 
muscle, and other organs and causing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to diabetes, 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

hypertriglyceridemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD)  
Major causes of mortality include heart disease (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia, liver disease (liver failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma), 
kidney failure, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has conducted an updated literature search to establish the prevalence of the condition. 
This has been submitted as an annex to the general report. It consists of 13 new publications of case 
reports specifically from different European countries within the European Union (reports ranging from 
2012-2016) and provides a more current understanding of the prevalence of the condition since the 
original designation in 2012 (published in Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and 
Therapy 2017:10 375–383). From this new data the sponsor proposes a revised prevalence calculation 
of 0.027 in 10,000 (rounded of to 0.03 in 10,000) a revision downwards from 0.2 in 10,000 in 2012.  
The COMP accepted the revised prevalence estimate proposed by the sponsor as the submitted 
calculation was based on recent data from more reliable sources than the original prevalence 
calculation.   
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are currently no authorised medicines for this condition in Europe. A recent publication, The 
Diagnosis and Management of Lipodystrophy Syndromes: A Multi-Society Practice Guideline J Clin 
Endocrinol Metab, December 2016, 101(12):4500–4511, offers guidance on how to manage and treat 
the condition. 
Current therapies prevent or ameliorate the comorbidities of lipodystrophy syndromes. There is no 
cure for lipodystrophy and no treatment that can regrow adipose tissue. The cornerstone of therapy for 
metabolic complications of lipodystrophy is diet. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

2.4.  COMP position adopted on 5 June 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of familial partial lipodystrophy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.03 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to diabetes mellitus and other metabolic abnormalities 
which usually develop in adulthood, with women affected more severely than men. Marked 
hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis, and fatty liver can develop in some patients.  
Coronary artery disease and other types of atherosclerotic vascular disease are more prevalent in 
women. Acanthosis nigricans is relatively uncommon. Most affected women are able to reproduce 
normally, but some develop hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, suggestive of polycystic ovary 
syndrome. Some patients develop mild to moderate myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and conduction 
system abnormalities; 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Myalepta, metreleptin, 
EU/3/12/1022 for treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

3.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 was 
based on the following grounds: 
•  Barraquer-Simons syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting approximately 0.1 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU), at the time the 
application was made. This is based on articles available in the public domain as well as expert 
statements; 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the consequences of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, 
hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis (e.g. risk of accelerated micro- and macrovascular 
complication, liver cirrhosis). The severity of metabolic abnormalities can lead to acute 
complications that can be debilitating such as painful eruptive xanthomas and life-threatening due 
to repeating bouts of acute pancreatitis;   
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the EU for patients 
affected by the condition.

3.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that Barraquer-Simons syndrome continues to be a distinct medical entity 
and still suitable as an orphan condition.. 
Barraquer-Simons syndrome has been recently renamed acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL) APL is 
more frequent in females (females:males, 4:1) and usually begins in childhood or adolescence. Loss of 
fat follows a cranio-caudal trend, progressively affecting the face, neck, shoulders, arms, and trunk. 
Fat accumulation can appear in the hips, buttocks, and legs. APL is associated with autoimmune 
diseases, especially membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in approximately 20% of 
patients. Most patients have low serum complement 3 (C3) levels, and some have presence of C3 
nephritic factor. Metabolic complications are uncommon. 
APL is part of a broader group of disorders called the lipodystrophy syndromes. These are a 
heterogeneous group of rare disorders that have in common selective deficiency of adipose tissue in 
the absence of nutritional deprivation or catabolic state. Lipodystrophies are categorized based on 
aetiology (genetic or acquired) and distribution of lost adipose tissue, affecting the entire body 
(generalized) or only regions (partial). This yields four major categories: congenital generalized 
lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), 
and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL). 
The proposed condition continues to be a distinct medical entity as described in the original orphan 
designation.  
The approved therapeutic indication: “Myalepta is indicated as an adjunct to diet as a replacement 
therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in lipodystrophy (LD) patients: 
•  with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised LD 
(Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above 
•  with confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in adults 
and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve 
adequate metabolic control.” 
falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of Barraquer Simmons syndrome 
or acquired partial lipodystrophy”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the final CHMP Day assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
This condition is associated with hormonal and metabolic derangements resulting in severe 
comorbidities that depend on extent of fat loss, age, and gender. Many complications of lipodystrophy

are secondary to deficient adipose mass, resulting in ectopic lipid storage in the liver, muscle, and 
other organs and causing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, 
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Acquired partial 
lipodystrophy is the mildest form of lipodystrophic syndrome. 
Major causes of mortality include heart disease (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia, liver disease (liver failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma), 
kidney failure, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has conducted an updated literature search to establish the prevalence of the condition. 
This has been submitted as an annex to the general report. It consists of 6 new publications of case 
reports specifically from different European countries within the European Union and provides a more 
current understanding of the prevalence of the condition since the original designation in 2012. 
(published in Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2017:10 375–383). 
From this new data the sponsor proposes a revised prevalence calculation of 0.0024 in 10,000 a 
revision downwards from 0.1 in 10,000 in 2012.  
The COMP accepted the revised prevalence estimate proposed by the sponsor as the submitted 
calculation was based on recent data from more reliable sources than the original prevalence 
calculation.

4.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
Lawrence syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 0.1 
in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU), at the time the application was made; the sponsor 
has based this on articles available in the public domain as well as expert statements; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to type II diabetes mellitus, and/or severe 
hypertriglyceridaemia. It is primarily the severe and often life-threatening metabolic consequences 
of Lawrence syndrome that contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Severe 
hypertriglyceridemia is independently associated with cardiovascular risk, particularly coronary 
artery disease, and predisposes patients to serious conditions such as acute pancreatitis, which can 
be life-threatening, especially when the underlying predisposing factor cannot be corrected. 
Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are the most common causes of cirrhosis. There is also a high 
incidence of proteinuric nephropathies; 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the EU for patients 
affected by the condition.

4.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that Lawrence syndrome continues to be a distinct medical entity which is 
still suitable as an orphan condition. 
Lawrence syndrome has been recently renamed acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL). 
AGL is more common in females (females:males, 3:1) and appears usually before adolescence (but 
may develop at any time in life) with progressive loss of fat affecting the whole body including palms 
and soles. Some fat accumulation can appear in the face, neck, or axillae. Metabolic complications are 
frequent and may be severe. AGL is often associated with autoimmune diseases. 
AGL is part of a broader group of disorders called the lipodystrophy syndromes. These are a 
heterogeneous group of rare disorders that have in common selective deficiency of adipose tissue in 
the absence of nutritional deprivation or catabolic state. Lipodystrophies are categorized based on 
aetiology (genetic or acquired) and distribution of lost adipose tissue, affecting the entire body 
(generalized) or only regions (partial). This yields four major categories: congenital generalized 
lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), 
and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL). 
The proposed condition continues to be a distinct medical entity as described in the original orphan 
designation.  
The approved therapeutic indication “Myalepta is indicated as an adjunct to diet as a replacement 
therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in lipodystrophy (LD) patients: 
•  with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised LD 
(Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above 
•  with confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in adults 
and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve 
adequate metabolic control.” 
falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of Lawrence syndrome or 
acquired generalised lipodystrophy” 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the final CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
This condition is associated with hormonal and metabolic derangements resulting in severe 
comorbidities that depend on extent of fat loss, age, and gender. Many complications of lipodystrophy 
are secondary to deficient adipose mass, resulting in ectopic lipid storage in the liver, muscle, and

other organs and causing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, 
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Acquired 
generalised lipodystrophy is associated with metabolic complications which are frequent and may be 
severe as well as autoimmune diseases. 
Major causes of mortality include heart disease (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia, liver disease (liver failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma), 
kidney failure, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has conducted an updated literature search regarding establishing the prevalence of the 
condition. This has been submitted as an annex to the general report. It consists of 2 new publications 
of case reports specifically from different European countries within the European Union and provides a 
more current understanding of the prevalence of the condition compared to the original designation in 
2012 (published in Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2017:10 375–
383). From this new data the sponsor proposes a revised prevalence calculation of 0.001 in 10,000 a 
revision downwards from 0.1 in 10,000 in 2012.  
The COMP accepted the revised prevalence estimate proposed by the sponsor as the submitted 
calculation was based on recent data from more reliable sources than the original prevalence 
calculation. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are currently no authorised medicines for this condition in Europe. A recent publication, The 
Diagnosis and Management of Lipodystrophy Syndromes: A Multi-Society Practice Guideline J Clin 
Endocrinol Metab, December 2016, 101(12):4500–4511, offers guidance on how to manage and treat 
the condition. 
Current therapies prevent or ameliorate the comorbidities of lipodystrophy syndromes. There is no 
cure for lipodystrophy and no treatment that can regrow adipose tissue. The cornerstone of therapy for 
metabolic complications of lipodystrophy is diet. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

4.4.  COMP position adopted on 5 June 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Lawrence syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.001 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to type II diabetes mellitus, and/or severe 
hypertriglyceridaemia. It is primarily the severe and often life-threatening metabolic consequences 
of Lawrence syndrome that contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Severe 
hypertriglyceridemia is independently associated with cardiovascular risk, particularly coronary 
artery disease, and predisposes patients to serious conditions such as acute pancreatitis, which can 
be life-threatening, especially when the underlying predisposing factor cannot be corrected. 
Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are the most common causes of cirrhosis. There is also a high 
incidence of proteinuric nephropathies; 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Myalepta, metreleptin, 
EU/3/12/1024 for treatment of Lawrence syndrome is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

the condition is chronically debilitating due to diabetes mellitus and its long-term complications. 
Patients develop recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis from extreme hypertriglyceridemia; end 
stage liver disease resulting from progressive cirrhosis secondary to hepatic steatosis and/or 
steatohepatitis; end-stage renal disease due to chronic kidney diseases related to diabetes or 
associated with the syndrome; cardiomyopathy, and accelerated atherosclerotic vascular disease. 
These patients die generally at a young age typically from cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic causes; 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the EU for patients 
affected by the condition.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that Berardinelli-Seip syndrome continues to be a distinct medical entity and 
still suitable as an orphan condition. 
Berardinelli-Seip syndrome has been recently renamed congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL). 
CGL is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by near-complete lack of fat starting at birth or 
infancy, prominent muscles, phlebomegaly, acanthosis nigricans, hepatomegaly, umbilical prominence, 
and voracious appetite in childhood. Multiple genetic causes have been identified, each with unique 
clinical features. Metabolic complications are frequent and may be severe. Cardiomyopathy or rhythm 
disturbances may occur. 
CGL part of a broader group of disorders called the lipodystrophy syndromes. These are a 
heterogeneous group of rare disorders that have in common selective deficiency of adipose tissue in 
the absence of nutritional deprivation or catabolic state. Lipodystrophies are categorized based on 
aetiology (genetic or acquired) and distribution of lost adipose tissue, affecting the entire body 
(generalized) or only regions (partial). This yields four major categories: congenital generalized 
lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), 
and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL). 
The proposed condition continues to be a distinct medical entity as described in the original orphan 
designation.  
The approved therapeutic indication: “Myalepta is indicated as an adjunct to diet as a replacement 
therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in lipodystrophy (LD) patients: 
•  with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised LD

Major causes of mortality include heart disease (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia, liver disease (liver failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma), 
kidney failure, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has conducted an updated literature search to establish the prevalence of the condition. 
This has been submitted as an annex to the general report. It consists of 14 new publications of case 
reports specifically from different European countries within the European Union and provides a more 
current understanding of the prevalence of the condition compared to the original designation in 2012 
(published in Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2017:10 375–383). 
From this new data the sponsor proposes a revised prevalence calculation of 0.01 in 10,000 a revision 
downwards from 0.05 in 10,000 in 2012.  
The COMP accepted the revised prevalence estimate proposed by the sponsor as the submitted

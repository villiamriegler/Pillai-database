1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Cystadrops 3.8 mg/mL eye drops solution 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each mL contains mercaptamine hydrochloride equivalent to 3.8 mg mercaptamine (cysteamine). 
Excipient with known effect:  
Each mL of eye drops solution contains 0.1 mg of benzalkonium chloride. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Eye drops solution. 
Viscous, clear solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Cystadrops is indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children from 
2 years of age with cystinosis. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Cystadrops should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
management of cystinosis. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one drop in each eye, 4 times a day during waking hours. The 
recommended interval between each instillation is 4 hours. The dose could be decreased progressively 
(to a minimum total daily dose of 1 drop in each eye) depending on the results of ophthalmic 
examination (such as, corneal cystine crystal deposits, photophobia). 
If the patient misses an instillation, the patient should be told to continue the treatment with the next 
instillation. 
The dose should not exceed 4 drops a day in each eye.  
The accumulation of corneal cystine crystals increases if Cystadrops is discontinued. The treatment 
should not be stopped. 
Paediatric population 
Cystadrops may be used in paediatric patients from 2 years of age at the same dose as in adults (see 
section 5.1).  
The safety and efficacy of Cystadrops in children aged less than 2 years has not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration  
For ocular use. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before the first admnistration, in order to facilitate the administration, the patient should be told to 
bring back Cystadrops at room temperature. After first opening, the patient should be told to keep the 
dropper bottle at room temperature. 
To avoid sticky eyes in the morning, the patient should be advised to apply the last drop of the day at 
least 30 minutes before going to bed. 
To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, 
surrounding areas, or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the dropper bottle. 
The patient should be told to discard the dropper bottle after 7 days of use. 
In case of concomitant therapy with other topical ocular medicinal products, an interval of ten minutes 
should be allowed between successive applications. Eye ointments should be administered last. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Contact lenses 
Benzalkonium chloride is known to discolour soft contact lenses. Contact with soft contact lenses 
should be avoided. Patients should be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to the administration of 
the eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before re-inserting contact lenses. 
Excipents with known effect 
Cystadrops contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation. 
Benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophtalmic products, has also 
been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Monitoring is 
required. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Since the recommended total daily dose of cysteamine base is no more than approximately 0.4% of the 
highest recommended oral dose of cysteamine base in any age group, no interactions with orally 
administered medicinal products are anticipated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
The recommended total daily ocular dose of cysteamine is no more than approximately 0.4% of the 
highest recommended dose of oral cysteamine in any age group. Systemic exposure of cysteamine 
following ocular administration is therefore lower than following oral administration. Although no 
effects during pregnancy and breast-feeding are anticipated, since systemic exposure to cysteamine is 
negligible, precautions should be taken with concomitant treatment with oral cysteamine. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of cysteamine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown.  
Therefore, oral cysteamine should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, 
unless clearly necessary. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient 
must be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine. 
Breast-feeding 
Cysteamine excretion in human's milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in 
breast-feeding mothers and neonates (see section 5.3), women taking oral cysteamine should not 
breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No data on the effect of cysteamine on human fertility are available. Studies in animals have shown a 
reduction on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cystadrops may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Temporary (in average less than 1 minute) blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the 
ability to drive or use machines. 
If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or 
using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions are eye pain, ocular hyperaemia, eye pruritus, lacrimation 
increased, blurred vision or eye irritation. The majority of these adverse reactions are transient and 
most are mild or moderate. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials and the French NPU programme 
with Cystadrops. Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency 
(by patient).  
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10),  uncommon (≥ 1/1 
000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000  to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data).  
System organ class 
Eye disorders 
Adverse reactions 
Very common : eye pain, vision blurred, eye irritation, ocular 
hyperaemia, eye pruritus, lacrimation increased, deposit eye 
Common : abnormal sensation in eye, dry eye, foreign body 
sensation in eye, eyelid oedema, eyelid irritation, visual 
impairment, hordeolum 
General disorders and administration 
site conditions 
Very common : instillation site discomfort (mainly sticky eyes 
and sticky eyelashes) 
Common : instillation site pain 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are the same as in adults. 
69 paediatric patients were followed through clinical trials and the French NPU programme. 19 
patients were under 6 years old, 21 between 6 and 12 years old and 29 between 12 and 18 years old. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose is unlikely to occur with ocular administration.  
In case of accidental ingestion, monitoring and symptomatic management of the patient should be 
implemented.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophtalmologicals, other ophtalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA21.   
Mechanism of action 
Cysteamine reduces corneal cystine crystal accumulation acting as a cystine-depleting agent by 
converting cystine to cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Two clinical trials were performed with Cystadrops: a single arm clinical trial on 8 children and adults 
(OCT-1 study) and a randomised, multi-centre, open label, active controlled phase III clinical trial 
(CHOC study) conducted on 32 patients. 
OCT-1 study 
This study assessed the safety and efficacy of Cystadrops during 5 years. Dose adaptation was 
performed following ocular examination. None of the patients discontinued treatment over the 5 year 
follow-up.  
The efficacy was assessed with In-Vivo Confocal Microscopy total score (IVCM score) by 
quantifying the cystine crystals in the 7 layers of the cornea. After 30 days of treatment and at a 
median frequency of 4 instillations per day, an average 30% decrease in the IVCM total score was 
observed. A mean decrease in corneal cystine crystal deposits of 30%, in comparison with baseline, 
was maintained over time with a median dosing regimen of 3 drops/eye/day (range 1-3 drops) for 7 of 
the 8 patients. Photophobia tended to improve over time. 
CHOC study 
This study was a randomised, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and the safety profile of 
Cystadrops following a period of 90 days of treatment at a dose regimen of 4 drops/eye/day. The 
IVCM total score was the primary efficacy endpoint. 15 patients were exposed to Cystadrops. The 
mean IVCM total score was calculated for 11 patients. A trend towards a lower IVCM total score in 
Cystadrops arm was observed at day 30. The mean decrease by 40% in the Cystadrops arm was 
confirmed at day 90. Superiority of Cystadrops was demonstrated compared to the control arm 
(cysteamine hydrochloride 0.10%) p<0.0001 95% CI (2.11; 5.58). Superiority of Cystadrops was also 
demonstrated for photophobia rated by the investigator compared to the control arm (cysteamine 
hydrochloride 0.10%) p=0.0048 95% CI (0.23; 1.14). 
Paediatric population 
Clinical data on safety and efficacy were collected during the 2 clinical trials (OCT-1 and CHOC 
studies). In total 15 paediatric patients were exposed to Cystadrops whereof 3 subjects (including one 
2 year and one 3 year old subject) being less than 6 years of age. The efficacy and safety results are 
similar in both paediatric and adult populations. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cystadrops in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of corneal cystine 
crystal deposits in cystinosis patients (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Human pharmacokinetic assessment following ocular administration of Cystadrops was not 
performed.  
Similarly to other topically administered ocular products, systemic absorption is likely to occur.  
However it should be considered that the recommended daily dose of cysteamine applied as eye drops 
is no more than approximately 0.4% of the highest recommended daily oral dose of cysteamine in any 
age group.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Systemic exposure following ocular administration is anticipated to be low. When there is concomitant 
use of ocular and oral treatment with cysteamine the contribution to any systemic risk from ocular 
administration is considered negligible. 
Preclinical data on oral cysteamine: 
Genotoxicity studies have been performed: induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured 
eukaryotic cell lines has been reported and specific studies with cysteamine did not show any 
mutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in the mouse micronucleus test. 
Reproduction studies showed embryofoetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in 
rats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic 
effects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis 
at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  
This is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is less than half the recommended clinical 
maintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.30 g/m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at 
375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival 
of the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of 
lactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the medicinal product inhibit prolactin secretion 
in animals.  
Administration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. 
High doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice 
but not in monkeys.  Experimental administration of the medicinal product causes depletion of 
somatostatin in several animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the medicinal 
product is unknown.  
No carcinogenic studies have been conducted with cysteamine.

1.  What Cystadrops is and what it is used for 
What Cystadrops is 
Cystadrops is an eye drops solution that contains the active substance cysteamine (also known as 
mercaptamine). 
What it is used for 
It is used to reduce the quantity of cystine crystals in the surface of the eye (cornea) in adults and 
children from 2 years of age with cystinosis. 
What is cystinosis 
Cystinosis is a rare hereditary disease in which the body is unable to remove excess cystine (an amino 
acid), causing cystine crystals to accumulate in various organs (such as kidney and eyes). 
Accumulation of crystals in the eye can lead to increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), corneal 
deterioration (keratopathy) and loss of vision . 
2.  What you need to know before you use Cystadrops 
Do not use Cystadrops 
If you are allergic to cysteamine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Cystadrops. 
Other medicines and Cystadrops 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Even if the level of Cystadrops in the blood is negligible, precautions should be taken. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

Driving and using machines 
You may find that your vision is blurred for a few minutes just after using Cystadrops. Do not drive or 
use machines until your vision is clear. 
Cystadrops contains benzalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains 5 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each drop which is equivalent to 0.1 
mg/ml. 
Benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact 
lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 15  minutes 
afterwards. 
Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the 
cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the 
eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor.

or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Recommended dose 
•  The recommended dose  is 1 drop in each eye, 4 times a day during waking hours.

•  Do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It 
could infect the drops.

to touch the tip of the dropper with your fingers. 
•  After using Cystadrops, press a finger into the corner of your eye by the nose (picture 7), then 
gently massage your upper eyelid to spread the eye drops over the eye. 
                                                                  
•  To avoid potential irritation, remove excess medicine around the eye with a moist tissue 
(picture 8). 
•  Repeat the step 3 for the other eye. 
•  Replace the small white cap on the dropper immediately after use. 
                                                              
Step 4: Storing the eye drops after use 
•  Place the dropper bottle into the carton box. 
•  Keep Cystadrops at room temperature (it will facilitate the use of the dropper). 
•  Discard 7 days after opening. 
If a drop misses your eye 
Try again.  
If you use Cystadrops with another eye medicine 
Ensure that there is at least a 10 minute gap between using Cystadrops and the other eye medicine. 
Administer eye ointments last. 
If you wear soft contact lenses 
Do not use the drops with your lenses in. After  using the drops wait 15 minutes before putting your 
lenses back in. 
If you use more Cystadrops than you should 
If you put too many drops in your eyes, rinse your eyes out, preferably with saline solution (or if not 
available with warm water). Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose. 
If you forget to use Cystadrops 
Wait for your next scheduled application and then continue with your regular routine. Do not use a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Cystadrops 
Cystadrops must be used every day for the medicine to work properly. If you stop using Cystadrops, 
cystine crystals accumulation in the eye (cornea) may increase and lead to increased sensitivity to light

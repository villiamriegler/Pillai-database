prospectively evaluates pregnancy outcomes in 
women with MS who were exposed to a Registry-

Herpes zoster infections 
Cases of herpes zoster have occurred with Tecfidera. The 
majority of cases were non-serious, however, serious 
cases, including disseminated herpes zoster, herpes zoster 
ophthalmicus, herpes zoster oticus, herpes zoster infection 
neurological, herpes zoster meningoencephalitis and herpes 
zoster meningomyelitis have been reported. These events 
may occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients 
taking Tecfidera for signs and symptoms of herpes zoster 
especially when concurrent lymphocytopenia is reported.  If 
herpes zoster occurs, appropriate treatment for herpes 
zoster should be administered. Consider withholding 
Tecfidera treatment in patients with serious infections until 
the infection has resolved (see section 4.8). 
The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated as follows: 
- to add the adverse reaction herpes zoster with a 
frequency not known.  
Infections 
Herpes zoster infections have been reported with Tecfidera 
use. In an ongoing long-term extension study, in which

subjects, including those who experienced a serious herpes 
zoster infection, had lymphocyte counts above the lower 
limit of normal.  Grade 2 and 3 lymphopenia prevailed in 
subjects with concurrent lymphocytopenia.  In the post-
marketing setting most cases of herpes zoster infection 
were non-serious and resolved with treatment.  Limited 
data is available on ALC in patients with herpes zoster 
infection in the post-marketing setting. However, when 
reported, most patients experienced grade 2 (< 0.8 ×

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of

TECFIDERA in the approved indication remains favourable, 
but recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
Further characterisation of the important identified risks 
“decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts” and 
“progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy” (PML) is 
required. Safety studies to further characterise the risk of 
PML are currently still ongoing. The impact of PML on the 
benefit/risk balance can currently not be sufficiently 
assessed. Moreover, a high number of cases of herpes 
zoster have been reported. A potential association of this 
risk with decreases in lymphocyte counts caused by

may also occur at any time during treatment, and may be 
serious and life threatening. Patients should be instructed 
to discontinue Tecfidera and seek immediate medical care if

Tecfidera therapy has been studied in study 109MS307. In 
this clinical study which involved a total of 71 patients with 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, patients on Tecfidera 
240 mg twice daily for at least 6 months (n=38) or non-
pegylated interferon for at least 3 months (n=33), mounted 
a comparable immune response (defined as  ≥2-fold 
increase from pre- to post-vaccination titer) to tetanus 
toxoid (recall antigen) and a conjugated meningococcal C  
polysaccharide vaccine (neoantigen), while the immune 
response to different serotypes of an unconjugated 23-
valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (T-cell 
independent antigen) varied in both treatment groups. A 
positive immune response defined as a ≥4 -fold increase in 
antibody titer to the three vaccines, was achieved by fewer 
subjects in both treatment groups. Small numerical 
differences in the response to tetanus toxoid and 
pneumococcal serotype 3 polysaccharide were noted in 
favour of non-pegylated interferon.  
No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of 
live attenuated vaccines in patients taking Tecfidera.

patients had lymphocyte counts ≥0.5 x 109/L and <0.8 x 
109/L for at least six months (moderate prolonged 
lymphopenia). If therapy is continued in the presence of 
moderate to severe prolonged lymphopenia, the risk of an 
opportunistic infection, including Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML), cannot be ruled out. 
At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold 
Tecfidera and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations.  
The symptoms of PML may be similar to an MS relapse.  
Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, 
progress over days to weeks, and include progressive 
weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, 
disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, 
and orientation leading to confusion and personality 
changes. 
The benefit/risk should be assessed in patients with 
lymphocyte counts ≥0.5 x 109/L and <0.8 x 109/L for 
more than six months.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Velcade (bortezomib) is a proteasome inhibitor specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like 
activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex 
that degrades poly-ubiquitinated proteins. The catalytic core of the 26S proteasome is the 20S 
proteasome. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in orchestrating the turnover of 
specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome 
prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within the cell, ultimately 
resulting in cancer cell death. By inhibiting a single molecular target, the proteasome, VELCADE affects 
multiple signalling pathways. Thus, the mechanisms by which VELCADE elicits its antitumour activity 
may vary among tumour types, according to the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to 
the inhibition of tumour growth. Specifically, VELCADE is thought to be efficacious in MM via its 
inhibition of nuclear factor B activation, its attenuation of interleukin-6-mediated cell growth, a direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly through antiangiogenic and other effects. 
Velcade was granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 26 April 2004 and is currently indicated as 
follows: 
VELCADE as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with progressive multiple myeloma 
who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone 
marrow transplantation. 
VELCADE in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with bone 
marrow transplant. 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a progressive haematologic disease. It is characterized by excessive 
numbers of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of intact monoclonal 
immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE) or Bence-Jones protein (free monoclonal κ and λ light chains).  
The estimated incidence of MM in Europe is 23,000 per year. MM is still considered to be an incurable 
disease and the 5-year relative survival rate is around 33%. Median age at diagnosis is 65 to 70 years, 
with the incidence of myeloma increasing with age. MM usually manifests as 1 or more lytic bone 
lesions, monoclonal protein in the blood or urine, and disease in the bone marrow. Disease progression 
is often associated with worsening of symptoms and organ dysfunction characteristic of myeloma, such 
as anemia, bone lesion-related symptoms, renal function impairment, and susceptibility to infections.  
Current treatment options, therefore, aim not only to improve survival but also to induce tumour 
response, inhibit tumour progression, and delay disease-related complications. 
The current recommendation is to incorporate high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant 
(HDT/SCT) into initial therapy programs for patients 65 years of age or younger. In patients older than 
65 years of age, the value of HDT/SCT is controversial and has not been formally established even in 
prospective randomized studies. Given that the median age at diagnosis of MM is between 65 and 70 
years, the majority of newly diagnosed patients is treated only with standard chemotherapy, with no 
consideration for HDT/SCT because of poor physical condition, co-morbidities, and increased toxicity. 
Standard chemotherapy regimens include melphalan-prednisone (MP), VAD (vincristine-doxorubicin-
dexamethasone), thalidomide-dexamethasone, and alkylating-agent combinations. Combination

chemotherapy with MP has been the standard-of-care in front-line non-transplant multiple myeloma 
therapy since the 1960s, and remains the most widely accepted treatment option for patients ineligible 
for HDT/SCT.  
Velcade is available as 1 mg and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection to be reconstituted at 
1 mg/ml for intravenous use. 
If an alternative route of administration could be utilized without reduction in treatment efficacy and 
without the introduction of significant offsetting complications, physicians could gain additional 
flexibility when individualizing their patients’ treatment. While non-clinical studies showed the oral 
route of VELCADE administration to be limited by poor bioavailability, the subcutaneous (SC) route was 
found to be an alternative to intravenous (IV) administration. For some patients, such as elderly or 
obese patients, where limited or difficult venous access or the need to preserve venous reserves 
present significant treatment challenges, as well as for patients who may receive prolonged treatment, 
SC administration was identified as a potentially useful means by which to facilitate care.   
The MAH proposed in this extension application, a new subcutaneous route of administration only for 
Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection, to be reconstituted at 2.5 mg/ml. No changes were 
proposed to the VELCADE dose or treatment schedule.  
1.2.  Quality aspects 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
The approved commercial dosage forms for Velcade are 1.0 mg powder for solution for injection and 
3.5 mg powder for solution for injection. The subject of this line extension is the addition of the 
subcutaneous (SC) route of administration only for Velcade 3.5 mg presentation.  
Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection for subcutaneous use is the same as that currently 
marketed for IV administration, the only difference being the volume and concentration of the 
reconstituted solution. The final concentration of the reconstituted Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution 
for injection for subcutaneous use is 2.5 mg/ml. 
1.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used in the new route of administration is the same as that used in the 
manufacture of the already approved presentations of Velcade. There were no changes made to active 
substance and therefore no additional data was submitted.  
1.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is a sterile, lyophilized formulation contained in a single-use vial, each vial 
containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib (as the boronic acid).  
The quantitative composition is the following: bortezomib as the boronic acid, 3.5 mg (active 
substance); mannitol 35 mg (bulking agent); t-butyl alcohol (co-solvent, eliminated during 
lyophilisation process); water for injection (solvent, eliminated during lyophilisation process); nitrogen 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 5/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
(inert gas to filter and control/break the vacuum after lyophilisation). Therefore, the final lyophilised 
powder of Velcade drug product contains bortezomib 3.5 mg as boronic acid and mannitol 35 mg. 
When reconstituted with 3.5 ml 0.9 % Sodium Chloride for Injection for IV use, each ml contains 1 mg 
bortezomib and 10 mg mannitol (final concentration 1.0 mg/ml).  When reconstituted with 1.4 mL 0.9 
% Sodium Chloride for Injection for SC use, each ml contains 2.5 mg bortezomib and 25 mg mannitol 
(final concentration 2.5 mg/ml). 
The finished product is contained in a 10 ml, 13 mm, USP/EP Type 1 borosilicate glass vial.  The 
closure is a 13 mm grey lyophilization stopper, composed of a bromobutyl elastomer with inert mineral 
reinforcement. The drug product is sealed with a 13 mm royal blue flip-off seal. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacture of Velcade finished medicinal product starts with the formulation of the bulk solution, 
obtained by mixing first water for injection and t-butyl alcohol, then mannitol and the active substance 
are added to the formulation vessel in two consecutive steps. The bulk solution is then filtered 
aseptically. The filtrated solution is aseptically filled in vials, and the vials undergo the lyophilisation 
process. Capping, decontamination, ink-jetting, 100% visual inspection, and transfer of the vials to the 
labelling and packaging site for secondary packaging are the final steps of the manufacturing of 
Velcade finished product. 
Critical manufacturing parameters have been identified and are controlled by the tests for bulk solution 
appearance, assay, density, bioburden, filter integrity, and fill weight checks. The overall 
manufacturing process is considered a non-standard process (aseptic filtration connected to 
lyophilisation). 
Product specification 
The same specifications for the reconstituted Velcade vials apply to both IV (1.0 mg/ml) and SC dosing 
(2.5 mg/ml). Analytical procedures for testing the reconstituted vials are the same for both IV and SC 
solutions except for the reconstitution volume.  
Stability of the product 
Compatibility and in-use stability data has been submitted for Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for 
injection for subcutaneous use to support a maximum storage time of 8 hours at 25°C for the 
reconstituted finished product in both vials and syringes. 
The compatibility/stability studies of the 2.5 mg/ml reconstituted solution for SC use were performed 
using different types of commercially available syringes and in vials under the normal conditions of 
use. In particular, reconstituted finished product (2.5 mg/ml) was loaded in commercially available 
syringes from three different vendors and held for up to 24 hours at room temperature in ambient 
light.  The following parameters were tested for the reconstituted solution held in the syringes: color 
and clarity of solution, particulates (visual inspection), pH, assay, and impurities. The results were 
compared to a baseline control solution in the original product vial. In addition, the appearance of the 
unreconstituted finished product and of the reconstituted solution were also evaluated for 24h at both 
5°C (protected from light) and room temperature (ambient light). The results were well within the 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 6/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specifications and show a good consistency with the 1.0 mg/ml reconstituted solution as well as with 
the baseline control.  
Furthermore, the stability of three batches of 2.5mg/ml reconstituted solution in vials has been tested 
for up to 24h at both 5°C and room temperature. The results were well within the specifications. 
The compatibility of Velcade with the recommended reconstitution diluent, 0.9%w/v sodium chloride 
solution for injection have been demonstrated in reconstitution stability studies, and compatibility with 
common dosage administration devices has also been demonstrated. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are accepted.   
1.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for infusion for SC use is the same as that currently marketed for 
IV administration, the only difference being the final volume and concentration of the reconstituted 
solution (1.4 ml, 2.5 mg/ml for SC use vs. 3.5 ml, 1.0 mg/ml for IV use). 
Compatibility and stability results for the 2.5 mg/ml reconstituted solution in syringes and vials were 
well within the specification, supporting the proposed in-use shelf life of 8 hours at 25oC, as currently 
approved for the 1.0 mg/ml reconstituted solution. 
1.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
1.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical studies TOX-7345, TOX-8394 were conducted in accordance with GLP. Non-clinical studies 
RPT-00526, RPT-00537, KLA-00236, TOX-6863, “Mouse Multiple Myeloma Model” were not conducted 
in accordance with GLP. Study reports were written according to internal standard operative 
procedures. 
1.3.2.  Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacodynamic (PD) of bortezomib after IV administration has been previously studied and 
described at the time of granting marketing authorisation. 
In the present application, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD of bortezomib were evaluated after SC, 
IV, and PO administration in single and repeat-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies in cynomolgus

monkeys by measuring blood 20S proteasome inhibition (Studies RPT-00526, RPT-00537). In addition, 
the anti-tumour effect of SC administered bortezomib was evaluated in the 5T2MM mouse model.  
Pharmacodynamic Effects on a Mouse Multiple Myeloma Model 
The effect of bortezomib administered SC on tumour burden and MM-related bone disease in a repeat-
dose study in the 5T2MM murine model of myeloma (Deleu S et al. Cancer Res 2009, 69 (13): 5307-
5311).  
In a 5T2MM mouse model, SC administration of bortezomib at 0.6 mg/kg (1.8 mg/m2) or 0.8 mg/kg 
(2.4 mg/m2), BIW, significantly decreased the burden of MM by significantly decreasing the number of 
plasma cells and serum paraprotein levels, decreasing angiogenesis and MM bone disease. 
RPT-00526 –Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics study of Bortezomib after Oral, 
Intravenous and Subcutaneous Administration of Bortezomib to Male Cynomolgus Monkeys 
Male Cynomolgus monkeys (4/group) were administered bortezomib twice weekly for two weeks (Days 
1, 4, 8, and 11) by IV, PO, or SC administration at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. 
Serial blood samples were collected into tubes containing tri-potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(K3EDTA) from all animals after each dose. Plasma and red blood cells were prepared from the blood 
samples. Bortezomib concentrations were quantified in the plasma using a liquid chromatography with 
a tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)-based method. Levels of inhibition of 20S proteasome 
activity were determined using an ex vivo spectrofluorometric assay in whole blood and red blood cells. 
In addition, bortezomib concentrations were determined in whole blood and red blood cells but the 
data is not presented in this report due to analytical issues. 
Bortezomib was detected in plasma through 48 hours post IV administration for all 4 doses. After PO 
administration bortezomib could be detected through 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours post-dose for doses 1, 2, 
3, and 4, respectively. After SC administration, bortezomib was detected in the plasma through 48 
hours post-dose after Dose 1 and Dose 4, and through 24 hours post-dose after Dose 2 and Dose 3. 
VELCADE was administered by IV bolus (0.1 mg bortezomib/kg), oral gavage (0.3 mg bortezomib/kg), 
or SC (0.1 mg bortezomib/kg) to four animals/group on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and samples for PK 
(plasma, whole blood, and red blood cells) and PD (whole blood and red blood cells) analysis were 
collected after each dose. 
The absorption of bortezomib was rapid after SC administrations.  
After Dose 1, the time at which the maximum concentrations of bortezomib after IV, PO, and SC 
administration occurred (Tmax) were 0.3, 1.0, and 0.3 hours post-dose, respectively. After Dose 4, the 
Tmax occurred at 0.3, 0.8, and 0.4 hours post-dose, respectively.  
After Dose 1, the mean observed peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) after IV, PO, and SC 
administration were 23.5, 6.73, and 49.5 ng/mL, respectively. After dose 4, the Cmax concentrations 
were 28.2, 6.27, and 51.7 ng/mL, respectively.  
After Dose 1, the mean area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-72hr) values 
after IV, PO, and SC administration were 35.5, 15.1, and 64.2, hours*ng/mL, respectively. After Dose 
4, the AUC0-72hr values were 76.6, 23.8, and 107, hours*ng/mL, respectively. 
The rank order of exposure to bortezomib in the plasma, as measured by Cmax and AUC, was SC 
administration, IV administration, and oral administration. The reason for the higher exposure after SC 
administration compared to IV administration at the same dose is unknown. 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 8/58
 
 
 
 
Comparable to IV, for the SC administration the level of proteasome inhibition increased sharply over a 
small concentration range before reaching a plateau.  
Oral administration resulted in a greater variability and a weak correlation between plasma 
concentrations of bortezomib and proteasome inhibition. 
RPT-00537 –Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study of Bortezomib after 
Intravenous or Subcutaneous Administration of Bortezomib to Male Cynomolgus Monkeys 
Male cynomolgus monkeys (4/group) were administered a single dose of bortezomib by IV or SC 
administration at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Following administration serial samples for PK (plasma) and PD 
(whole blood) analysis were collected from all animals. Bortezomib concentrations were quantified in 
the plasma using a liquid chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)-based 
method.  
Levels of inhibition of 20S proteasome activity were measured using an ex vivo spectrofluorometric 
assay in whole blood. 
Bortezomib was detected in plasma through 72 hours post-dose after IV and SC administration. The 
time at which the maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib after IV and SC administration 
occurred (Tmax) were 0.1 and 0.4 hours post-dose, respectively. 
The mean observed peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 57.4 and 35.2 ng/mL, respectively. The 
mean area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-72hr) values were 53.1 and 
85.9 hr*ng/mL, respectively. 
Exposures to bortezomib in the plasma were broadly similar between SC and IV administration with 
exposure as measured by Cmax being slightly higher after IV administration and exposure as 
measured by AUC being higher after SC administration. 
The reason the AUC after subcutaneous administration is higher than the AUC after IV administration is 
unknown. 
Administration of bortezomib by IV and SC administrations reached similar levels of inhibition of 20S 
proteasome activity with a delay in maximal inhibition from SC administration when compared to IV 
administration. The mean maximum levels of 20S proteasome inhibition after IV and SC administration 
were 80.4% and 78.7%, respectively. 
Proteasome inhibition was maximal at 0.25-0.5 hours post-dose after IV administration and 1 hour 
post-dose after SC administration. 
With IV administration where the level of proteasome inhibition increased sharply over a small 
concentration range and reaching a plateau. Proteasome inhibition after SC administration increased 
more gradually over a broader range of bortezomib concentrations.

1.3.3.  Toxicology 
Table 1 – Overview of toxicology studies 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of bortezomib after SC administration was characterised in repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
Cynomolgus monkeys and was compared with the known toxicological profile of bortezomib 
administered IV. Information on local tolerability and tissue reaction after SC administration of 
bortezomib was obtained from a single-dose study in rabbits. 
KLA-00236 – 3-week Repeat Dose Toxicity Study in Cynomolgus Monkey 
This was a preliminary toxicology study. The objective of this study was to determine the potential 
systemic toxicity of VELCADE when administered SC in male Cynomolgus monkeys and to determine 
the persistence or reversibility of any finding after a 10-day recovery period.  
The study consisted of two groups of male Cynomolgus monkeys receiving either an escalating dose 
regimen of VELCADE (0.166 mg/kg [2.0 mg/m²] on Day 1, and 0.182 mg/kg [2.2 mg/m²] on Days 8 
and 15; Group 1 – 1 animal) or VELCADE (0.166 mg/kg [2.0 mg/m²] for three weekly doses; Group 2 
– 3 animals) by SC injection. Effects of VELCADE were monitored by clinical observations, body 
weights, and periodic assessment of haematology parameters. After the final blood sample collection 
time point on Day 26, all surviving animals were released to the Test Facility. 
The Group 1 animal that was dosed at 0.166 mg/kg for the first dose and then 0.182 mg/kg at the 
second and third doses did not exhibit clinical signs; however, all the animals had notably elevated 
white blood cell parameters during the dosing period. The apparently normal values at Day 26 indicate 
that the alterations were reversible. 
Dosing with VELCADE at 0.166 mg/kg once weekly for 3 weeks resulted in a number of clinical signs 
for the two Group 2 animals that survived. For one of these animals, the clinical signs resolved, but for 
the other there was still skin erythema and dry flaky skin at the end of the 10-day recovery period. 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/58
 
 
 
 
 
The one Group 2 animal that was euthanized after the first dose at 0.166 mg/kg had a gastric ulcer 
that may have been pre-existing and exacerbated by the dosing.  
TOX7345 – 12-week (4 cycles) Repeat dose Toxicity Study in Cynomolgus Monkey 
This study was to investigate the potential subchronic toxicity of bortezomib in the cynomolgus 
monkey following up to 4 cycles of 11 days of administration by subcutaneous and intravenous 
injection. Each of cycles 1, 2 and 3 consisted of dosing on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by 1 week of 
recovery and cycle 4 consisted of dosing on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 with terminal euthanasia 72 hours 
later. In addition, the toxicity of bortezomib was investigated when administered once weekly by 
subcutaneous injection to cynomolgus monkeys for up to 12 weeks. Furthermore, the PK/PD of 
bortezomib was evaluated after chronic dosing by subcutaneous versus intravenous routes. 
The study design is detailed in the table below. 
Table 2 – Study TOX7345 design 
The following were evaluated: clinical signs and food consumptions (daily), injection sites (pre-dose on 
each dosing day), body weight (weekly), neurological parameters, ophthalmology (pre-treatment and 
Week 10/11) and electrocardiograms (pre-treatment and Day 72). In addition, samples were collected 
for haematology and serum biochemistry (pre-treatment and Days 14, 35 and 77 for Groups 1, 2, 3 
and 5; pre-treatment and Days 11, 32, 53 and 81 for Group 4), urinalysis (Days 14, 21, 35, 42, 63 
and 77 for Groups 1, 2, 3 and 5; Days 11, 14, 32, 35, 53, 56,77 and 81 for Group 4), toxicokinetics 
and pharmacokinetics (Days 1, 32, and 7 for Groups 1, 2, 3 and 5; Days 1, 50 and 78 for Group 4). At 
the end of the treatment period, macroscopic observations were collected at necropsy, selected organs 
were weighted and protocol directed tissues were microscopically examined. 
Main toxicity included chronic emesis and diarrhoea, body weight loss, alterations in serum 
biochemistry parameters and microscopic lesions in peripheral nervous system and spinal cord, renal 
cortical tubular degeneration/hypertrophy, hypocellularity in bone marrow, and atrophy of lymph 
nodes.  
The adverse event profile of VELCADE at dose level of 1.66mg/Kg/dose QW for 12 weeks was similar 
although more pronounced when compared to that observed following SC or IV administration at 
0.1 mg/kg.  
The no-adverse-effect-level was not determined in this study. The MTD was reached at 0.1mg/kg for 
both SC and IV administrations (4 cycles of twice weekly dosing followed by one week untreated), but 
could not be determined for the weekly injection. Minor histopathological changes were observed in 
peripheral nervous system (numerically higher following SC administration) and spinal cord, lymph 
nodes and kidneys following MTD of VELCADE.

Comparison of the plasma exposure of bortezomib after SC administration in monkeys and humans is 
given in the table below. The exposure ratio is slightly higher than 1, which is as expected from 
previous IV studies with bortezomib.

human after SC administration 
TOX8394 - 8-Week Subcutaneous Toxicity Study in Cynomolgus Monkeys 
In this study, Cynomolgus monkeys received SC administration of Velcade once a day for 5 
consecutive days during Weeks 1 through 8. 
Repeated, once-daily, five times per week subcutaneous administration of Velcade was well tolerated 
by Cynomolgus monkeys for eight weeks. All monkeys survived to scheduled sacrifice.  
Analysis of plasma Velcade concentrations and blood 20S Proteasome activity showed that the time of 
maximum concentration (Tmax) of plasma Velcade typically occurred within 7 to 15 minutes of dosing, 
or at 30 minutes post dose if this was the first post dose sampling in the series. Maximum 20S 
Proteasome inhibition typically occurred 15 to 113 minutes after the observed Tmax. Peak 
concentrations (Cmax) and exposures (AUC) to Velcade in cynomolgus monkeys increased greater 
than dose proportionally at the low to mid dose levels and were generally dose proportional at the mid 
to high dose levels. Mean area under the effect-time curve for 20S Proteasome inhibition was less than 
dose proportional. There was evidence of accumulation at all dose levels after 8 weeks of dosing. 
Subcutaneous administration of Velcade at ≥ 0.0166 mg/kg/dose resulted in decreased platelets and 
increased mean platelet volume, erythema and oedema at the injection site, soft and liquid stool, and 
increased urine creatinine, inorganic phosphorus, and sodium.  
Subcutaneous administration of Velcade at ≥ 0.0333 mg/kg/dose resulted in decreased food 
consumption, soft and liquid stool, and lesions in the kidney, pancreas, prostate, spinal cord and 
peripheral nerves, and initial body weight loss that in most cases was followed by body weight gain 
during the course of treatment.  
At the high dose of 0.05 mg/kg/dose, histopathologic lesions were observed at the injection site, spinal 
cord, and peripheral nerves, and kidney weights were higher than controls.  
Under conditions of the study and based on the available data, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(NOAEL) for repeated, five times weekly subcutaneous administration of Velcade to cynomolgus 
monkeys for 8 weeks cannot be identified. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was considered to be 
the highest dose, 0.05 mg/kg/dose.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerability / tissue reaction of Velcade following a single subcutaneous injection was studied in 
female New-Zealand White rabbits (Study TOX6863). 
The administered dose was 0.1 mg/kg body weight (1.2 mg/m2) at two different concentrations 
3.5 mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml to female New-Zealand White rabbits. Clinical observations for signs of 
toxicity or irritation at the injection sites were made daily. Necropsies were performed on all rabbits on 
study days 1 and 4. The injection sites and surrounding tissues from each rabbit were dissected and 
examined macroscopically and histopathologically. 
The dose selection for the present study was based upon information of a previously conducted local 
tissue irritation study with Bortezomib administered to male New Zealand white rabbits. 
In that study, the local tissue reaction of 0.1 mg/kg body weight (1.2 mg/m2) bortezomib at the 
clinical concentration of 1.0 mg/ml was evaluated following a single injection either via IV, perivascular 
(PV), SC or intramuscular (IM) routes. Results indicated no tissue reaction after SC administration. 
Based upon the above, it was decided to set the dose at 0.1 mg/kg body weight (1.2 mg/m2) at two 
different concentrations, 3.5 mg/ml as the expected concentration in the human SC clinical trials and 
1.0 mg/ml as in the current clinical IV concentration. 
Gross pathological signs seen at the bortezomib and vehicle injection sites were slight to marked 
subcutaneous haemorrhages in a few rabbits mainly related to the injection procedure. Oedema noted 
at the bortezomib injection site of one rabbit dosed with bortezomib concentration 1.0 mg/ml and 
sacrificed 3 days after injection was considered test article related. 
Histopathological examination revealed minimal reaction in the bortezomib injection site of 4 out of 
12 female rabbits that were subcutaneously injected with 0.1 mg/kg body weight at a concentration of 
3.5 or 1.0 mg/ml and killed respectively 1 or 3 days after injection. 
1.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental impact of bortezomib as active pharmaceutical ingredient was presented according 
to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
A first estimate of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) of bortezomib in surface waters 
receiving the discharge of sewage treatment was calculated and then refined with estimation for the 
market penetration of the medicinal product in the EU. Based on these calculations, the PECsurfacewater of 
bortezomib was 0.0000039 μg/L. 
As the PECsurfacewater was orders of magnitude below the threshold value of 0.01 μg/L, no further 
testing in the aquatic environment was required. Consequently, bortezomib and/or its metabolites are 
unlikely to represent a risk to the environment following prescribed usage in patients. 
1.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In 2 studies a higher systemic exposure following SC administration compared to IV one at the same 
dose, was observed. The reason for the higher systemic exposure following SC administration is 
unknown. However, the issue may be considered solved as human PK data do not confirm the 
anomaly.   
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 13/58
 
 
 
 
 
A similar degree of proteasome inhibition (expressed as maximal proteasome inhibition or AUE) was 
reached after SC or IV administration of bortezomib. 
Four toxicology studies were performed: Either single (rabbit) or repeat (Cynomolgus monkeys) 
administration studies. The duration of the repeated-dose toxicity studies were related to the duration, 
therapeutic indication and scope of the proposed clinical trial that is: administrations at days 1, 4, 8, 
and 11 followed by a 10-day rest period (days 12-21). This 3-week period is considered a treatment 
cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.  
The limited number of animals used in these studies did not allow the detection of quantitative 
differences between the IV and SC routes of administration, however, no significant qualitative 
differences were observed. Clear toxicity signs were evident in monkeys at dose level of 0.166 mg/Kg 
once weekly for up to 12 weeks. Similar signs were observed with 0.1 mg/Kg for 4 cycles (MTD). The 
adverse effect profile of VELCADE when administered at 0.166 mg/kg QW for 3 weeks SC was similar 
to that observed after IV administration. 
There was evidence of accumulation at all dose levels after 8 weeks of dosing SC administration. 
Safety pharmacology, reprotoxicity, pharmacodynamic drug interactions were discussed in previous 
submission. No additional studies were performed which was acceptable. 
Considering that the number of patients for which the IV route is not recommended and that could 
take advantage of the SC route is likely to be low, the impact of bortezomib in the environment is not 
expected to increase due to the new SC route. 
1.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In animal studies, SC and IV administration of bortezomib at a similar dose level (0.1 mg/kg 
[1.2 mg/m2]) resulted in comparable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicological profiles.  
No new toxicological findings were noted in non-clinical studies after administration via the SC route. 
1.4.  Clinical aspects 
1.4.1.  Introduction 
While non-clinical studies showed the oral route of VELCADE administration to be limited by poor 
bioavailability, the subcutaneous (SC) route was found to be an alternative to intravenous (IV) 
administration. For some patients, such as elderly or obese patients, where limited or difficult venous 
access or the need to preserve venous reserves present significant treatment challenges, as well as for 
patients who may receive prolonged treatment, SC administration was identified as a potentially useful 
means by which to facilitate care. As a consequence, the MAH conducted studies to support the SC use 
of Velcade.

1.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic of bortezomib following SC relative to IV administration was studied in 51 subjects 
(27 subjects in SC and 24 subjects in IV) participating to the 2 studies mentioned in the above table. 
For both studies, bortezomib plasma samples were analyzed in a central laboratory (Tandem Labs, 
West Trenton, NJ, USA) using a validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS) assay.  
For both studies, the following main PK parameters were estimated from blood samples obtained from 
subjects administered VELCADE through the IV and SC route: 
-  Cmax – maximum observed plasma concentration 
-  C0 – initial concentration extrapolated to time zero after an IV dose 
- 
tmax – time of maximum plasma concentration

-  AUClast - the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last

-  AUC∞ - the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity 
- 
t1/2 – apparent terminal half-life, computed as (ln2/ke) where ke is the slope of the terminal 
log-linear phase of the plasma concentration-time curve. 
The PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods using actual times 
of blood sampling and for the statistical analysis: 
- 
the PK parameters are presented by arithmetic mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the 
individual treatments; 
-  Tmax values were present as median (range).  
-  Pair-wise comparison between 2 treatments for Cmax and AUC values are based on log-
transformed data. 
Absorption  
Study CAN-1004 was a randomized, Phase 1 pilot study that first compared the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of single-agent SC and IV VELCADE in 24 subjects 
(20 evaluable for pharmacokinetic analyses) with relapsed multiple myeloma. The subject population, 
dose and schedule of VELCADE administration (1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle), 
and duration of therapy (up to 8 cycles) were consistent with the approved recommendation at that 
time. For SC administration, Velcade was injected in the thigh or abdomen. Twenty subjects (10 IV and 
10 SC) were evaluable for PK analysis. 
The study was performed in target population. Out of the 24 subjects enrolled in the study, 10 (10 of 
24; 42%) were men and 14 (14 of 24; 58%) were women. Mean body weight was 69 kg in the IV 
group versus 71 kg in the SC group. The mean age was 60.4 years with 18 subjects (18 of 24; 75%) 
being less than 65 years.   
Twenty subjects (10 IV and 10 SC) were evaluable for PK analysis. Blood samples for PK and PD 
analyses were collected on Days 1 and 11 of Cycle 1 at the following time-points: 30 min before 
VELCADE administration, and at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, and 2, 4, 6, 10, 24, 48, and 72 hours after 
VELCADE administration. 
Time course of bortezomib in plasma after IV or SC administration of 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 11 of 
Cycle 1 are shown in the following figures.

PK parameters are shown in the following table:

Subcutaneous Administration of VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 11 of Cycle 1 (Study 
CAN-1004) 
Table 6 – Summary of Analysis for Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Study CAN-1004) 
There was a high degree of inter-subject variability (based on %CV) in: 
-  mean plasma Cmax values of VELCADE for both routes of administrations (i.v., %CV = 63.3; 
s.c., %CV= 50.5); 
-  AUClast (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last 
quantifiable concentration): 95.0% for i.v. and 19.4% for s.c.;  
-  AUC∞ (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time): 
86.2% for i.v. and 35.4% for s.c.; 
-  mean terminal half-life values that were 98.1 hours and 65.7 hours for the i.v. and s.c. groups, 
respectively(%CV=147.8 and 70.7 for the i.v. and s.c. groups, respectively). 
Study MMY-3021 was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international, prospective 
study demonstrating the comparable efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and 
tolerability, of single-agent IV and SC VELCADE in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma after prior 
systemic therapy.  
A substudy of 31 subjects from Study MMY-3021 was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic characteristics of IV and SC VELCADE administration.  
The study was performed in target population. The proportion of males to females in the SC treatment 
group was equal (50%), there were more males (64%) versus females (36%) in the IV treatment 
group. In both the SC and IV treatment groups the median age was 64.5 years (range: 38 to 88), with 
50% of subjects less than 65 years of age and 50% of subjects 65 years of age or older.  
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report

Subjects were randomized to receive VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 administered by SC injection or IV injection 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3 week cycle for 8 cycles.  
In order to minimize VELCADE SC injected solution, a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL bortezomib was 
used for SC administration rather than the standard concentration of 1 mg/mL for IV administration.  
Potential SC injection sites were abdomen (right or left) and thighs (right or left) and it was 
recommended to rotate SC injection sites within a treatment cycle.  
Blood samples for PK and PD analyses were collected on Day 1 predose and on Day 11 of Cycle 1 at 
the following time-points: 0 hour (immediately before dosing), and at 2, 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and at 
1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 24, 32, 48, and 72 hours after VELCADE administration on Day 11. 
Time courses of bortezomib in plasma after IV or SC administration of 1.3 mg/m2 on Day 11 of Cycle 1 
are shown in the following figure.

PK parameters were the following: 
Table 7 – Summary of Bortezomib Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous or 
Subcutaneous Administration of VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 on Day 11 of Cycle 1 (Study MMY-
3021) 
AUC following SC injection was equivalent to that of the IV injection with a geometric mean ratio (SC 
to IV) of 0.992 and 90% CI of 80.18% to 122.80%; ie, within the standard 80% – 125% 
bioequivalence criteria. 
Effect of Concentration of Injected Solution 
In study MMY-3021, bortezomib was reconstituted to a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL for SC 
administration. In study CAN-1004, bortezomib was injected subcutaneously in a concentration of 
1 mg/mL, thus a higher volume was injected subcutaneously according to the posology scheduled 
1.3 mg/m2.  
The pharmacokinetic and PD parameters of the SC administration were comparable between the 
2 studies as indicated in the table below. Thus, the volume of the SC injected solution does not appear 
to influence bortezomib pharmacokinetics or PD.  
Table 8 – Summary of Pharmacokinetic and  Pharmacodynamic Parameters Following 
Subcutaneous Injections of VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 Using 2.5 mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml Solutions 
Distribution 
In study CAN-1004, systemic exposure following single dose was measured by calculating individual 
and mean AUClast (104 ng.h/mL and 92.1 ng.h/mL, for the i.v. and s.c. groups, respectively) and 
AUC∞ values (183 ng.h/mL and 151 ng.h/mL, for the i.v. and s.c. groups, respectively). There was a 
similarity between both mean AUCs when compared across both routes of administrations.  
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 20/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean pseudo-steady state volume of distribution was relatively high (Vd =1636 L and Vd/F = 
1330 L, for i.v. and s.c. groups, respectively), indicating extensive distribution into peripheral tissues.  
An increase in the systemic exposure to VELCADE was observed following multiple dose administration 
(Day 11) consistent with similar observations from previous studies. This was particularly evident from 
a comparison of the plasma AUClast values, where higher mean values were observed after 
administration on Day 11 than after Day 1 for both the i.v. (241 ng.h/mL) and s.c. (195 ng.h/ml) 
routes of administrations.  
Distribution values were not calculated in Study MMY-3021.  
Elimination 
VELCADE exhibited similar total systemic clearance following single dose administration in Study CAN-
1004 (mean CL = 17.9 L/h and mean CL/F = 16.6 L/h for the i.v. and s.c. groups, respectively).  
The mean terminal half-life values were 98.1 hours and 65.7 hours for the i.v. and s.c. groups, 
respectively, with a high degree of inter-subject variability (%CV=147.8 and 70.7 for the i.v. and s.c. 
groups, respectively).  
Lower mean clearance values were observed after repeat administration. As expected, a clear 
statistically significant difference was apparent upon assessment of the mean plasma Cmax values 
after s.c. administration compared with i.v. administration. 
Elimination values were not calculated in Study MMY-3021.  
1.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
For both CAN-1004 and MMY-3021 studies, whole blood samples were analyzed to determine the 
chymotryptic activity of the proteasome, using an established method based on a fluorometric 
measurement of the rate at which the proteasome hydrolyzes an amide bond in a small peptide 
substrate.  
Analysis of proteasome inhibition was performed on the change in proteasome activity from baseline of 
the first dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1) to subsequent time points. The activity was normalized to the amount 
of protein present in each sample. Actual blood sampling times relative to study medication 
administration was used for the analyses.  
The following VELCADE plasma PD parameters were estimated: 
-  Emax– Observed maximum percent inhibition of 20S proteasome activity, taken directly from 
the inhibition-time profile 
- 
tmax – Time when Emax is observed, taken directly from the inhibition-time profile 
-  AUElast – Area under the percent inhibition-time curve from time 0 to the last sampling time 
point (72h), 72 hours, calculated by linear trapezoidal summation 
Study CAN-1004 
Pharmacodynamic samples were to be taken at the following 13 scheduled times for each VELCADE 
treatment group, on Day 1 and Day 11 of the first cycle. 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 21/58
 
 
 
 
 
As seen in the figure below, there was similar inhibition due to VELCADE on Day 1 and Day 11 within 
each of the SC and IV routes of administrations. Overall, there was marginally higher maximal 
inhibition (based on Emax only) after IV administration compared with SC administration. For most 
subjects, the variability as depicted by standard deviations was relatively higher at time points later 
than 24 hours. 
Figure 4 - Mean (SD) Whole Blood 20S Proteasome Specific Activity (SpA) inhibition-Time 
Profile of Velcade Following IV and SC administration as measured on Day 1 and Day 11 
After single dose 
In general, PD activity declined over a 72-hour period, in most cases 12 hours after VELCADE 
administration with mean proteasome inhibition values ranging 20% to 40%, for both treatment 
groups.  
Inter−subject variability range was 30% or less (expressed as coefficient of variation, %CV) during the 
first 12 hours after dosing, whereas variability was higher at subsequent sampling time points after 
dosing (range, 35% - 256%) for both treatment groups on Day 1 and Day 11. 
There were no statistically significant differences (p-value = 0.11 on Day 1) in the mean area under 
the effect-time curve (AUE) of VELCADE for SC compared with IV administration on Day 1. 
After repeat dose 
There were no statistically significant differences (p-value = 0.64 on Day 11) in mean AUE of VELCADE 
for both treatments after multiple dosing. As would be expected, mean maximum inhibition values on 
Day 11 were 68.8 % (6.49%) for the IV group and 57.0 % (12.8%) for the SC group; this difference 
was statistically significant (p-value = 0.022). Upon qualitative assessment, no differences in the mean 
pharmacodynamic parameter plots for the two treatment groups were observed. 
In general, there was higher variability observed between Day 1 and Day 11 mean values in the SC 
group compared with the IV group. Nevertheless, across both groups, no significant impact on 
proteasome inhibition by VELCADE was noticed after either SC or IV administration.

Study MMY-3021 
Blood samples were analyzed for 20S proteasome specific activity using a qualified kinetic fluorescence 
detection method. All 31 subjects who participated in the pharmacokinetic portion of this study were 
included in the pharmacodynamic analysis. 
The mean maximum percent inhibition of proteasome activity (Emax) was comparable for the SC and 
IV treatment groups (63.7% vs. 69.3%; respectively) following multiple 1.3 mg/m2 SC or IV doses of 
VELCADE (Table 9). 
Table 9 – Summary of Bortezomib Pharmacodynamic Parameters Following Intravenous or 
Subcutaneous Administration of VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 on Day 11 of Cycle 1 (Study MMY-3021 
pharmacodynamic analysis set) 
Median Tmax was approximately 5 minutes for the IV treatment group and 2 hours for the SC 
treatment group. Mean AUE72 following SC injection was comparable to that of the IV injection and 
within the observed variability (CV 36 - 55%). 
The protocol recommended rotation of SC injections sites between the abdomen (left and right) and 
the thigh (left and right). There were no apparent PD differences related to the site of injection as 
Emax, Tmax, and AUE72 following SC injection in the abdomen were comparable to those in the thigh. 
1.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Studies supporting the SC administration were correctly designed and performed. Data from 
51 subjects (27 subjects in SC and 24 subjects in IV - pooled: 20 from study CAN-1004 and 31 from 
study MMY-3021), were obtained and analysed.  
The pharmacokinetic and PD parameters of the SC administration were comparable between the 
2 studies CAN-1004 and MMY-3021. Systemic exposure (AUC) was similar after both SC and IV 
administration. As expected, Cmax was markedly lower after SC administration.  
In the CAN-1004 study maximum plasma bortezomib concentration (Cmax) was lower (94% lower on 
Day 1 and 86% lower on Day 11) than the IV Cmax, and occurred later with Tmax of 30 minutes for 
SC administration and a Tmax of approximately 5 min for the IV route. The difference in exposure in 
terms of Cmax was short-lasting. A slight increase in exposure following the SC administration relative 
to the IV administration was observed for about 4 hours post dosing. The total systemic exposure to 
Bortezomid was similar following SC or IV injection (mean AUClast = 155 (SC) vs. 151 (IV) ng.h/mL) 
showing that the original peak observed after IV injection did not have any impact on AUClast following 
SC or IV injection. The equivalent bortezomib total systemic exposure following SC and IV injections 
was translated into comparable efficacy results between the 2 routes of administrations. 
Accumulation (AUC day 11/AUC day 1) was also very similar for both routes. 
PD effect, measured as maximum proteasome inhibition (Emax) and the area under the effect time 
curve for proteasome inhibition (AUE) were comparable between the SC and IV routes.  
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 23/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the MMY-3021 study, the mean Emax was comparable for the SC and IV groups. Mean AUE72 
following SC injection was comparable to that of the IV injection and within the observed variability 
(CV = 36 - 55%).  
The site of SC injection (abdomen or thigh) and the volume of the injected solution (1mg/ml CAN-
1004, or 2.5 mg/ml MMY-3021) did not affect significantly PK or PD parameters. Also, Emax and 
AUE72 were comparable. 
Overall results of the two studies clearly show that systemic exposure and PD effect are similar after 
both SC and IV administrations.  
No new studies were aimed to assess drug-drug interactions. Based on bortezomib equivalent systemic 
exposure following the SC route relative to the IV route, the results of all completed bortezomib clinical 
pharmacology IV studies with drugs that may alter bortezomib metabolism such as ketoconazole 
(strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP 2C19 inhibitor), rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 inducer), 
dexamethasone (a relatively weak CYP 3A4 inducer), melphalan, and prednisone are also applicable to 
the SC route of administration. 
1.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology data demonstrated that systemic exposure and PD effect were similar after both 
SC and IV administration, thus supporting the SC route of administration. The site of SC injection 
(abdomen or thigh) and the volume of the injected solution (1mg/ml CAN-1004, or 2.5 mg/ml MMY-
3021) did not significantly affect PK or PD parameters. 
1.5.  Clinical efficacy  
1.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In the two clinical studies submitted, the same dosage schedule was used according to the approved 
Velcade, i.e. 1.3 mg/m2 twice weekly by IV bolus or SC injection on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week 
cycle for up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).  
In study CAN-1004, VELCADE concentration was 1 mg/ml for both groups IV and SC. 
In order to reduce the volume of subcutaneously injected VELCADE in Study MMY-3021, each vial of 
VELCADE was to be reconstituted in 1.4 mL of normal saline, for a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL 
rather than the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL used for IV administration. The use of a 2.5 mg/mL 
concentration was supported by data from a rabbit tolerability study in which minimal reaction was 
observed at the VELCADE-treated injection site of female rabbits that were injected SC with 0.1 mg/kg 
body weight at a concentration of 3.5 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL. 
1.5.2.  Main study MMY-3021  
Methods 
Study MMY-3021 was a randomized, open-label, Phase 3, non-inferiority study that compared the 
safety and efficacy of VELCADE administered by either the IV and SC route in 222 subjects with 
progressive disease who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy (previous treatment with Velcade 
was an exclusion criterion) and had measurable disease and evidence of disease progression since 
their last previous therapy for multiple myeloma. As discussed before, a substudy of 31 subjects from 
Velcade X-47

Study MMY-3021 was also conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
characteristics of IV and SC VELCADE administration.  
The study consisted of 3 phases: a screening phase (21 days), an open-label treatment phase of 24 
weeks (Subjects were to receive VELCADE on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle for 8 cycles) and 
a post-treatment follow-up phase.  
Study Participants  
The study protocol required randomisation of not less than 216 subjects with multiple myeloma who 
had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy and had measurable evidence of progression disease since 
their last previous therapy were planned for enrollment in the study.

Amongst exclusion criteria were previous treatment with VELCADE, more than 3 previous lines of 
therapy, Peripheral neuropathy. 
Treatments 
VELCADE was administered at its approved dose and schedule (1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 
every 3-week cycle) for 8 cycles in both treatment groups. Concomitant dexamethasone administration 
was permitted during Cycles 5 to 8 for subjects who, after Cycle 4, had a documented suboptimal 
response (no change or partial response [PR]). Dexamethasone, was given 20 mg orally on the day of 
and the day after VELCADE administration (Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each cycle). 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 25/58
 
 
 
 
 
Dose modifications of VELCADE or dexamethasone could be made as necessary, according to the 
protocol-specified dose adjustment guidelines. Subjects with progressive disease (PD) were to 
discontinue treatment at the time that PD was confirmed. Subjects who withdrew from treatment for 
reasons other than progressive disease were to continue to undergo efficacy assessments for the 
duration of the treatment phase or until documentation of progressive disease. 
In the post-treatment follow-up phase, subjects who had not progressed were to be assessed every 8 
weeks until PD was recorded. After PD, subjects were to be assessed every 12 weeks for survival and 
subsequent therapies. Follow-up was to continue until the end of the study, which was defined as 1 
year after the last subject was randomised. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Study MMY-3021 was to compare the ORR, defined as the proportion of 
subjects with CR or PR after 4 cycles of subcutaneously administered VELCADE and intravenously 
administered VELCADE in subjects with previously treated multiple myeloma. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
-  To determine the complete response (CR), near complete response (nCR), and very good 
partial response (VGPR) rates after 4 cycles of single-agent VELCADE, the ORR after 8 cycles 
including the effect of adding dexamethasone, the duration of response, time to progression 
(TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year survival, and time to response following 
VELCADE treatment, administered either SC or IV. 
-  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 2 routes of administration, including the local 
tolerability of SC administration. 
-  To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (via 20S proteasome 
inhibition assay in whole blood) of subcutaneously administered VELCADE compared with 
intravenously administered VELCADE. 
Exploratory objectives of the study were: 
-  To assess medical resource utilization data specifically related to the diagnosis and treatment 
of any complications related to either the SC or IV route of administration was to be collected. 
-  To determine the feasibility of detecting baseline proteasome activity levels in bone marrow in 
a subset of subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Disease response was measured according to the modified European Group for Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation (EBMT) criteria, with the addition of the PR subcategories of nCR and VGPR.  
Primary endpoint 
Non-inferiority was defined as retaining 60% of the IV (active control) treatment effect as measured by 
ORR (CR+PR rate after 4 cycles of Velcade prior to the addition of dexamethasone).  
Secondary endpoints 
-  CR, nCR, and VGPR after 4 cycles (prior to the addition of dexamethasone); definitions of each 
response are described in, Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease Response ORR (CR 
+ PR) after 8 cycles (including the addition of dexamethasone). 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report

-  Duration of response, defined as the time from the date of first documentation of a confirmed 
CR or PR (overall cycles) to the date of first documented PD. Responders without PD were to 
be censored at the date of the last clinical assessment of response. 
-  TTP, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of 
PD or relapse from CR, whichever occurred earlier. Subjects who had not progressed were to 
be censored at the date of the last clinical assessment of response. 
-  PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented PD, 
relapse from CR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier. Subjects who had not 
progressed and were alive on the cut-off date for analysis were to be censored at the date of 
the last clinical assessment of response. 
-  One-year survival, defined as the survival rate at 1 year after randomization. Survival was 
measured from the date of randomization to the date of a subject’s death. If a subject was 
alive or the vital status was unknown, the subject was to be censored at the date that he or 
she was last known to be alive. 
-  Time to response, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first 
documentation of a confirmed CR or PR. Those subjects without confirmed response (CR or PR) 
were to be censored either at the time of PD or at the last clinical assessment of response. 
Evaluations of safety and tolerability included assessments of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests 
(haematology and serum chemistry), local injection site tolerability, KPS, the FACT/GOG-Ntx 
questionnaire, physical examination findings, body weight, BSA, and vital sign measurements. An 
electrocardiogram and chest x-ray were performed during the screening phase and could be repeated 
during the study as clinically indicated. Additionally, a 12-lead ECG was to be performed during 
screening and repeated during the study as clinically indicated. 
Sample size 
The response-evaluable population (145 subjects and 73 subjects in the SC and IV treatment groups, 
respectively) included subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who had measurable 
disease at study entry. 
Under the alternative hypothesis where the ORRs are both assumed to be 35.5%, which is the lower 
limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the pooled response rate, and assuming a 1-sided alpha 
level of 0.025 and approximately 80% power, approximately 216 subjects (144 in the SC treatment 
group and 72 in the IV treatment group) were needed to show non-inferiority of SC to IV VELCADE.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 1.3 mg/m2 VELCADE by either SC or IV 
injection: this ratio was chosen because it provides higher statistical power than a 1:1 ratio for the 
study objective, and also because the safety and efficacy profile of single-agent IV VELCADE in 
relapsed multiple myeloma had already been well characterized. Moreover, it allowed for the collection 
of more data for the experimental group with the same total number of subjects enrolled in the study. 
Subjects were stratified by the number of lines of prior therapy (1 versus >1) and International 
Staging System (ISS) stage (incorporating beta2-microglobulin and albumin levels; Stages I, II, or 
III). The planned total sample size was approximately 216 subjects (144 in the SC treatment group 
and 72 in the IV treatment group).

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study, thus no blinding was performed. 
Statistical methods 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomized subjects. 
Time-to-event endpoints include time to response, 1-year survival, TTP and PFS. They were to be 
analyzed using the ITT population as the primary analysis population. The primary endpoint and 
secondary response-related endpoints were to be analyzed using the response-evaluable population as 
the primary analysis population.  
The response-evaluable population was defined as subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and had measurable, secretory multiple myeloma, defined as a serum monoclonal IgG or IgM of ≥10 
g/L or a serum monoclonal IgA or IgE ≥5 g/L, or a serum monoclonal IgD of ≥0.5g/L, or urine M-
protein of ≥200 mg/24 hours, at study entry. 
Subjects were to be categorized by the best response observed after 4 cycles of study drug. The 
number and percentage of subjects in each response category were to be calculated. The 95% CI 
around ORR SC - 0.60 ORR IV was to be calculated. To declare non-inferiority, the lower bound of this 
CI needed to be ≥0. The p value associated with the non-inferiority hypothesis was to be calculated. If 
non-inferiority was demonstrated, the 95% CI around the difference between the treatment groups 
(ORRSC - ORRIV) was to subsequently be calculated to assess superiority.  
No interim analysis was planned for this study.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Overall Response Rate After 4 Cycles  
Results for the primary endpoint are presented in the table below, where confirms non-inferiority of SC 
compared with IV administration was confirmed. The ORR after 4 cycles in the IV treatment group in 
Study MMY-3021 was consistent with that observed in historical studies of single-agent VELCADE in 
multiple myeloma studies (41% in Study M34101-039 [APEX] and 38% in Study MMY-3001). The 
stratified Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the relative risk of achieving response for SC versus IV was 0.99 
(95% CI: 0.71, 1.37), which excludes the pre-specified non-inferiority margin 0.6.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - Progression-Free Survival 
A total of 130 PFS events were observed (82 events [55.4% of subjects] in the SC treatment group 
and 48 events [64.9% of subjects] in the IV treatment group). The median PFS was 310 days (10.2 
months) in the SC treatment group and 245 days (8.0 months) in the IV treatment group. Ninety-two 
(41.4%) of all subjects were censored. The hazard ratio (SC vs. IV) was 0.824 (95% CI: 0.574, 
1.183), and the p-value was 0.29450 (stratified log-rank test). These results indicate that PFS 
(censored for subsequent therapy) is similar in the SC and IV treatment groups. The percentage of 
total patients censored was 40.1%; in the SC group the percentage was 43.2 and in the IV group was 
33.8. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - One-Year Survival 
A total of 59 deaths were observed (41 in the SC treatment group [27.7% of subjects] and 18 in the IV 
treatment group [24.3% of subjects]). After a median follow-up of 11.8 months, survival data were 
not yet mature (27% of events observed). As of the clinical cut-off date of 31 Aug 2010, median 
survival was 654 days (21.5 months) in the IV treatment group, and not yet reached in the SC 
treatment group.  
The median estimates were not considered reliable, as the Kaplan-Meier curves either did not cross or 
barely crossed the median (50%) line close to the maximum follow-up, at which point very few 
subjects remained at risk for death. The 1-year survival rate was 72.6% (95% CI: 63.1, 80.0) for the 
SC treatment group and 76.7% (95% CI: 64.1, 85.4) for the IV treatment group. The p-value for 
testing the difference in 1-year survival rate was 0.50368, which indicates that there is no difference in 
1-year survival rate between the SC and the IV treatment groups.

Table 17 – Summary of Overall Survival (Study MMY-3021 – Intent-to Treat analysis set) 
The percentage of total patients censored was 73.4% (72.3% in the SC group and 75.7% in the IV 
group). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints – Time to Response 
Based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the median time to first response was 3.5 months in both the SC 
treatment group (106 days) and the IV treatment group (108 days). The hazard ratio (SC vs. IV) was 
1.059 (95% CI: 0.716, 1.567), and the p-value was 0.77247 (stratified log-rank test), indicating that 
the time to first response was similar between the SC and IV treatment groups  
For responders, the median time to first response was 1.4 months in both the SC treatment group (44 
days) and the IV treatment group (43 days). 
The median time to best response was 106 days (3.5 months) in the SC treatment group and 128 days 
(4.2 months) in the IV treatment group. The hazard ratio (SC vs. IV) was 1.049 (95% CI: 0.710, 
1.552), and the p-value was 0.80777 (stratified log-rank test), indicating that the time to best 
response was similar between the SC and IV treatment groups.  
For responders, the median time to best response was 49.5 days (1.6 months) in the SC treatment 
group and 46 days (1.5 months) in the IV treatment group. 
The median time to CR was not estimable for both the SC and IV treatment groups, because only 12% 
of subjects had best response CR. The hazard ratio (SC vs. IV) was 1.026 (95% CI: 0.456, 2.308), and 
the p-value was 0.95127 (stratified log-rank test), indicating that the time to CR was similar between 
the SC and IV treatment groups.  
For responders, the median time to CR was 87 days (2.9 months) for the SC treatment group and 44 
days (1.4 months) for the IV treatment group; however, this difference should be interpreted with 
caution because of the relatively small number of subjects with CR.

Ancillary analyses 
A number of Exploratory Analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints (e.g. adjusted for baseline 
covariates, censored for subsequent therapy) were performed. These results indicate that the endpoint 
results were comparable between the SC and IV treatment groups.

Study identifier 
EudraCT Number: 2008-000952-28 
Design 
This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  international,  multicenter,  phase  3  study  that 
evaluated  VELCADE  in  subjects  with  multiple  myeloma  who  had  received  1  to  3  prior 
lines  of  therapy  and  had  measurable  evidence  of  disease  progression  since  their  last 
previous  therapy.  Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  1.3 
mg/m2  VELCADE  either  SC  or  IV.  The  planned  total  sample  size  was  approximately 
216 subjects. 
Duration of main phase: 
24-week open-label treatment phase (maximum of 
30 weeks for subjects who received an additional 2 
cycles of treatment after Sponsor approval)  
21 days

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
An exploratory analysis of pooled efficacy data from Studies MMY-3021 and CAN-1004 was undertaken 
to provide a comprehensive assessment of all available efficacy data for the SC route of VELCADE 
administration.  
Most demographic characteristics were similar between the pooled SC and IV treatment groups. The 
median age was 64.0 years in both the SC and IV treatment groups (range: 38 to 88), with 52% of all 
subjects <65 years of age. The SC treatment group had 51% male subjects, whereas the IV treatment 
group had 58% male subjects. No noteworthy differences were observed in the number of treatment 
cycles received by subjects in the SC and IV treatment groups, and the median VELCADE dose 
intensity was 4.84 mg/m2 per cycle in the SC treatment group and 4.78 mg/m2 per cycle in the IV 
treatment group. A similar percentage of subjects in the SC treatment group (53%) and the IV 
treatment group (50%) received dexamethasone.

For the integrated efficacy data from response-evaluable subjects in Studies MMY-3021 and CAN-1004, 
the ORR was 53% in the SC treatment group and 51% in the IV treatment group. The stratified 
Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the relative risk of achieving response (CR or PR) for SC versus IV was 
1.04 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.35). Response rates were similar between the integrated SC and IV treatment 
groups across all subpopulations analyzed (age, sex, and number of lines of prior therapy).  
Supportive study CAN-1004 
The phase 1 pilot study CAN-1004 (n=24) was not powered to assess efficacy endpoints. However, the 
results of analyses of efficacy data from Study CAN-1004 suggesting that the SC and IV routes were 
similar with regard to the effect of treatment on disease response was confirmed by the statistically 
significant finding of non-inferiority observed in Study MMY 3021.  
For TTP, after a median follow up of 6.6 months, a total of 6 events were observed (2 [17%] SC vs. 4 
[33%] subjects IV). The median TTP (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was not estimable for the SC treatment 
group and was 7.4 months for the IV treatment group. The hazard ratio was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.134, 
4.826) favouring the SC treatment group.  
The 6 month PFS rate was 76.4% in the SC treatment group and 75.8% in the IV treatment group. 
After a median follow-up of 6.6 months, no deaths were reported in either treatment group. 
Therefore, the results of Study CAN-1004 were consistent with those from Study MMY 3021, and 
differences in efficacy were likely related to smaller sample size and the limited scope of efficacy 
analyses performed in the pilot study. Data on long-term efficacy endpoints were not available for 
Study CAN-1004; however the 6 month PFS rate in that study was consistent with that later observed 
in Study MMY 3021 (68.9% SC vs. 70.8% IV). 
1.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study was performed in subjects with progressive multiple myeloma, consistently with the target 
population for which Velcade is already approved. Based on the results of the pilot phase 1 study CAN-
1004, Velcade was administered at its approved dose and schedule, and the same dose was used in 
both arms (IV and SC routes of administration).  
The choice of Response Rate (RR) as the primary efficacy endpoint is considered appropriate and is 
enforced by secondary endpoints and exploratory efficacy analysis. 
Tumour assessment was performed at planned time-points and was symmetrical in the two treatment 
arms. M-protein assessment was centralised and blinded, although bone marrow samples and 
radiology assessment of skeletal or extramedullary plasmacytomas, were not independently centrally 
reviewed. 
Baseline demographic characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment groups except for 
gender and world region that showed both inter and intra groups differences. However, results from 
subgroup analysis of ORR after 4 cycles and TTP by Sex and Region indicated a limited and non 
significant impact of gender and world regions.

CHMP assessment report

In Study MMY-3021, baseline disease characteristics were well balanced although slight differences can 
be observed between the two groups for some factors with prognostic relevance.  
In the SC arm there was a slight prevalence of patients with impaired renal function, lytic bone lesions 
and poorer Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS): patients with KPS < 80 were 61% in the SC group 
and 48% in the IV group. In the IV group there were more patients with high risk cytogenetic 
abnormality. The MAH clarified that subjects were stratified by the number of lines of prior therapy (1 
vs. >1) and International Staging System (Stages I, II, and III). With the targeted 216 subjects (222 
actually randomized), there was no possibility to add a third stratification parameter. 
The observed imbalances were all in favour of the IV treatment group, with the exception of high-risk 
cytogenetic abnormalities which was in favour of the SC group. 
The ORR during the first 4 cycles together with the stratified Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the common 
relative risk of achieving response for SC versus IV, was evaluated for a number of subgroups 
including the cytogenetic abnormalities (high-risk, standard risk, and not done) subgroup. The point 
estimate of the relative risk in the high-risk cytogenetic subgroup (and all other subgroups) was 
cantered around 1, and in none of the subgroups did the 95% CI exclude 1. This indicates that the 
impact of high-risk cytogenetics on the primary endpoint was limited. Overall, these results confirm the 
consistency of VELCADE activity regardless of baseline characteristics. 
With regard to prior therapy, it should be noted that although treatment groups were well balanced for 
the number of previous lines of therapy, patients in the IV arm had received more frequently High 
Dose Stem Cell Transplant (27% vs 21%), anthracyclines (43% vs 39%), alkylating agents (88% vs 
86%), thalidomide (46% vs 39%), lenalidomide (12% vs 8%) and IMID (53% vs 42%). 
However, the subgroup analyses for ORR after the first 4 cycles, performed to evaluate the impact of 
these imbalances in the treatment groups, did not show any relevant differences. 
In both treatment groups, the rate of patients who completed the planned cycles of treatment and 
discontinued due to disease progression, was the same. Moreover, reasons for discontinuation other 
than disease progression (adverse events, death during treatment), were equally represented in the 
SC and IV treatment groups. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results were comparable between SC and IV treatment groups. 
The same European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) response criteria and 
validated computer-programmed statistical analysis software algorithm, as in previous trials were 
used. 
The study met the non-inferiority objective with an ORR of 42%, after 4 cycles, in both arms: these 
results are in line with historical data with single-agent Velcade. Results in the response-evaluable 
population were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis in the ITT population. 
ORR after 8 cycles was 52% in both arms. The addition of dexamethasone improved response to a 
similar degree in both arms: 30% of subjects with no response at the end of cycle 4 obtained a PR at 
the end of cycle 8, and 13 % with PR at cycle 4 obtained a CR at cycle 8. 
For the integrated efficacy data from response-evaluable subjects in Studies MMY 3021 and CAN-1004 
(pooled analysis), the ORR was 53% in the SC treatment group and 51% in the IV treatment group. 
The stratified Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the relative risk of achieving response (CR or PR) for SC 
versus IV was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.35).  
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/58
 
 
 
 
The non-inferiority of the SC formulation compared to the IV formulation, was demonstrated based on 
the choice of a non-inferiority margin of 60%. Indeed, the 60% retention chosen by the MAH is rather 
arbitrary and is potentially wide (CI 6.1, 27.1). It is noted that, although the observed difference in 
ORR was relatively small (-0.4%), the inferior CI margin for the non inferiority of SC vs IV is close to 
the 60% retention margin potentially leaving uncertainties on the estimated efficacy. However, given 
the context of this particular non inferiority setting in which the same active substance is given by 
different routes of administration and PK data have confirmed similar overall exposure between IV and 
SC use, a non-inferiority margin can actually be used to assess the “precision” of the estimate of 
treatment effect rather than the clinical relevance. In this scenario, the point estimates, ORR both 42% 
for IV and SC use, can be considered reassuring as opposed to the formal conclusion of the non 
inferiority exercise that the width of the resulting CI leaves too much uncertainty about the estimated 
efficacy.  
MMY-3021 study results continued to support the additional efficacy benefit observed following 
administration of dexamethasone to treatment regimen after 4 cycles, this observation needs to be 
reflected in the SmPC section 5.1 (addition of dexamethasone in patients with documented suboptimal 
response (no change + PR). 
The potential benefit of an earlier introduction of dexamethasone therapy could not be definitely 
established, considering that a late response to bortezomib (and not a response to the combination 
with dexamethasone), could not be excluded in the absence of a control group. 
ORR rate is only accepted as primary endpoint when the results are supported by the results of the 
secondary endpoint PFS and 1 year survival. The updated analysis, provided at the median follow up of 
17.5 months (data cut off on February 26th 2011), confirms the initial PFS result (improvement of 0.9 
month in favour of SC treatment) and shows a smaller difference in 1-year survival rate between SC 
and IV regimen (1.6% compared to 4.1% in the original analysis) with a median survival not yet 
reached in the IV treatment group.  
However, based on the immaturity of survival data (32% of death events observed) and the rate 
(27.5%) of patients censored for progression events, efficacy results of Study MMY-3021 cannot be 
seen as final. Results from 1-year OS and PFS provided with the update are consistent with the 
primary efficacy endpoint of the pivotal trial MMY-3021, ORR observed after 4 cycles. 
Results for secondary endpoints were similar in both arms, although the high rate of censored patients 
TTP (53%), PFS (40%), 1-year survival rate (73%), should be considered.  
The MAH clarified that the imbalance in the number of censored patients for PFS and time to 
progression (TTP) between the IV and SC groups was due to the lower percentage of events (disease 
progression for TTP, disease progression or death for PFS) in the SC arm. This observation is also 
substantiated by the hazard ratios: for TTP, the hazard ratio (SC vs. IV) was 0.839 with 95% CI 
(0.564, 1.249); for PFS, the hazard ratio (SC vs. IV) was 0.824 with 95% CI (0.574, 1.183). Both of 
them are in favour of the SC arm. The 1-year survival rate was 73% in the SC arm, which was 
numerically lower than what was observed in the IV arm (77%). However, the p-value is 0.5037 for 
testing the difference in 1-year survival rate between the SC and IV arm. This demonstrates that the 
1-year survival rates were similar between SC and IV arm. 
Information was provided on time and reason of censoring for disease progression, PFS and OS. In all 
the three Kaplan-Meier plot the number of censored was higher in the initial part of the curve in both 
arms. Moreover, the rate of censored by reason for censoring seems to be balanced between the two 
arms.

1.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Velcade given subcutaneously was non-inferior in terms of efficacy (ORR after 4 cycles = 42% for IV 
and SC analysis) compared to IV administration. The ORR was 52% in both the SC and IV treatment 
groups after 8 cycles. This result is in line with overall PK/PD findings. 
The stratified Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the relative risk of achieving response for SC versus IV was 
0.99 with 95% CI (0.71, 1.37), which excludes the pre-specified non-inferiority margin 0.6. 
1.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety data was reviewed from Study CAN-1004 (N=24 [12 IV + 12 SC]) and Study MMY-3021 
(N=221 [74 IV + 147 SC]).  
Supportive safety data were from pooled analysis for the VELCADE SC and IV administration:  
 
Pooled data from the 2 subcutaneous studies of VELCADE, Study MMY-3021 and Study CAN-
1004. The primary objective of the pooled safety data analyses was to compare the observed 
safety pattern of VELCADE administered SC to VELCADE administered IV in subjects with 
previously treated multiple myeloma in Studies MMY-3021 and CAN-1004. 
 
Integrated data from 8 historical studies (M34100-024, M34100-025, M34101-029, M34101-
039 [VELCADE treatment group], M34101-040, DOXIL-MMY-3001 [VELCADE control group], 
JPN-MM-101/201, and JPN-MM-301). Integrated safety data in 1356 subjects who received IV 
VELCADE administered at a starting dose of 1.3 mg/m2, with or without the addition of 
dexamethasone, in 8 completed sponsor-initiated studies are also included as a reference. 
Within the pooled safety population from the two studies, 245 subjects were treated with at least 1 
dose of VELCADE: 86 subjects by the IV route and 159 subjects by the SC route. The difference in size 
of the 2 groups was due to the 2:1 randomization ratio used in Study MMY-3021 to increase the 
statistical power of efficacy endpoints. 
The median number of VELCADE cycles administered was the same for both treatment groups at 8 
cycles (range; 1-10 for both groups). In the SC and IV treatment groups, 79% and 77% of subjects, 
respectively, received at least 4 cycles of treatment. After Cycle 4, some asymmetry was observed 
between the treatment groups with more subjects on treatment in the SC treatment group; the 
percentage of subjects receiving 5 cycles in the SC and IV treatment groups was 70% vs. 66%, 
respectively, and the percentage of subjects receiving 8 cycles was 56% and 51%, respectively. 
Dexamethasone was added to the treatment regimen for 53% of subjects in the SC treatment group 
and 50% of subjects in the IV treatment group. 
The median duration of VELCADE treatment was the same for both the SC and IV treatment groups at 
22.57 weeks and 22.29 weeks (7.6 cycles), respectively.

Data from the IV treatment group in the 2 pooled randomized SC studies were compared with the 
integrated historical IV studies. Grade ≥3 adverse events and VELCADE discontinuations due to adverse 
events were consistent between the pooled IV treatment group in the randomized SC studies and the 
integrated historical IV studies (Table 20). 
Table 20 – Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events for MMY-3021, Pooled Data and 
Historical Studies 
Table 21 summarizes the incidence of the most frequent (at least 10% in either treatment group) 
treatment-emergent adverse events by MedDRA SOC for the integrated historical IV studies.

Table 21 – Incidence of Most Frequent (at Least 10% in Any Treatment Group) Adverse 
Events by MedDRA SOC (MMY-3021, CAN-1004, and Historical VELCADE IV) 
The principal SOC reporting more than 10% higher incidence rates in the SC group than in the IV one, 
was investigations. This difference is due to a 14% incidence of the adverse event of ‘weight 
decreased’ in the SC treatment group as compared with 2% for the IV treatment group. The incidence 
of weight decrease was mild to moderate in severity. Grade 1 weight decrease was reported for 9% of 
subjects in the SC group compared with 1% in the IV group; Grade 2 was reported for 5% and 0%, 
respectively. In the IV group, 1% of subjects had Grade 3 weight decrease, and no Grade 3 weight 
decrease was reported for the SC treatment group. An analysis of the collected weight data only 
showed a difference in incidence of Grade 1 weight loss. 
A comparison of adverse events by preferred term for SC and IV treatment groups showed a ≥10% 
difference between the 2 groups in the incidence of diarrhoea (25% vs. 40%) and peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (33% SC vs. 44% IV), in favour of the SC treatment group. 
Of the 159 subjects who received at least 1 SC injection, 96 (60%) subjects reported at least 1 local 
SC injection site reaction during the study, with 89 (56%) subjects already having a reaction in the 
first cycle. Out of the 615 injections administered during Cycle 1, 239 (39%) injections were associated 
with redness. Reactions of redness appeared to diminish over the course of the cycle, with 47% of 
subjects having a reaction at Cycle 1, Day 1 and 34% of subjects having a reaction at Cycle 1, Day 11. 
A number of subgroup analyses were performed. Overall, the majority of subjects in each subgroup 
experienced at least 1 adverse event, with incidences comparable across all subgroups (range, 92% - 
100%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The overall incidence of serious adverse events was similar for the SC treatment group (34%) 
compared with the IV treatment group (36%). Furthermore, the incidence of serious adverse events by 
SOC was very similar between the 2 treatment groups with a <5% difference noted for most SOCs.  
The only exception occurred in the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC where 
subjects in the SC treatment group had a 7% incidence of serious adverse events compared with 1% 
for the IV treatment group. 
Incidence rates for all individual serious adverse events were also low (<5%), except for the 
percentage of subjects with pneumonia, which was the same for both groups (6%). 
There was a difference of ≥10% for the Investigations SOC in favour of the IV treatment group (16% 
vs. 5%). This difference was primarily due to a 14% incidence of the preferred term “weight 
decreased” in SC treatment group compared with 2% for the IV treatment group. In an analysis of 
body weight data there was only a 5% difference between groups for Grade 1 weight decrease (5% to 
<10% change in body weight) in the SC treatment group (21% SC vs. 16% IV) and no difference in 
higher grade weight change. 
A comparison of the SC and IV treatment groups of pooled safety data from studies MMY-3021 and 
CAN-1004 showed that 57% of subjects in the SC treatment group and 71% of subjects in the IV 
treatment groups had Grade ≥3 adverse events. Differences between the SC and IV treatment groups 
of ≥5% were observed in Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (1% vs. 9%), Nervous 
System Disorders (14% vs. 23%), and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (4% vs. 10%). 
Grade ≥3 adverse events by SOC with the highest frequency were: Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders (33% SC and 37% IV), and most commonly included neutropenia (18% SC vs. 22% IV) and 
thrombocytopenia (14% SC vs. 20% IV); Nervous System Disorders (14% vs. 23%), specifically 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (4% SC vs. 14% IV) and neuralgia (3% SC vs. 8% IV). 
Deaths 
The table below summarizes all causes of mortality occurring within 30 days after the last dose of 
study medication; for Study MMY-3021, study medication was either VELCADE or VELCADE in 
combination with dexamethasone.

1004, and Historical VELCADE IV)

One sudden death (under General disorders and administration site conditions) was recorded in SC 
pooled population. A higher % of progression disease as cause of death was observed in the SC group 
(18% SC vs. 9% IV). 
Laboratory findings 
The majority of subjects in the SC and IV treatment groups experienced Grade 1 or Grade 2 
haemoglobin during treatment. Subjects in the SC treatment group had a higher incidence of Grade 2 
haemoglobin (50% vs. 41%).  
The incidence of Grade ≥3 haematology parameters was lower for subjects in the SC group compared 
with the IV group, with the exception of Grade ≥3 haemoglobin, which was similar for both treatment 
groups (14% and 11%). There was an 11% lower incidence of Grade ≥3 neutropenia (22% vs. 33%), 
a 10% lower incidence of leucopenia (9% vs. 19%), and 4% lower incidence of thrombocytopenia 
(18% vs. 22%), all in favour of the SC treatment group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 22% (33 subjects) in the SC treatment group 
compared with 27% (20 subjects) in the IV treatment group. 
In both treatment groups, the most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in the 
Nervous System Disorder SOC (12% in the SC treatment group vs 16% in the IV treatment group). 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy events were the more represented discontinuation-leading adverse 
events (5% in the SC treatment group vs 12% in the IV treatment group), followed by neuralgia (4% 
SC vs. 8% IV). The incidence of all other adverse events leading to VELCADE discontinuation was low 
(<5%). 
1.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Primary data demonstrating the safety of SC VELCADE administration were provided by Study MMY-
3021, with additional data provided by the Phase 1 pilot study CAN-1004. 
Although meaningful comparison of the safety profiles from the individual studies is limited by the 
small number of subjects in the safety population (159 patients), no inconsistency or major concerns, 
were identified. Therefore, data from Studies MMY-3021 and CAN-1004 were pooled to provide the 
most possible robust safety characterization of SC VELCADE. In addition, to determine whether the 
safety findings observed for Studies MMY-3021 and CAN-1004 were consistent with historical findings, 
an integrated analysis was conducted of safety data from 1,356 subjects enrolled in 8 earlier, 
completed, sponsor-initiated studies of subjects with previously treated, relapsed multiple myeloma. 
Overall, SC route provides improved systemic safety profile with an acceptable local tolerability. The 
majority of local injection site reactions were redness, of mild or moderate intensity, and resolved in all 
cases. 
The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 22% in the SC treatment group compared with 
27% in the IV treatment group. 
Systemic safety profile favours the SC treatment group with a lower incidence of Grade ≥3 AE and 
treatment modification. In particular, there was a lower incidence of diarrhoea (25% SC vs. 40% IV) 
and a lower incidence of peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥2 in the SC group; treatment discontinuation 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 46/58
 
 
 
 
 
due to peripheral neuropathy was also inferior in this group than in the IV group (5% vs 12%, 
respectively). 
One of main safety result of study was a lower incidence of peripheral neuropathy between the two 
treatment groups (38% SC vs. 53% IV). Sensory neuropathy at baseline (Grade 1) was reported by 
21% and 27% of subjects in the SC and IV treatment groups, respectively. In prior studies, presence 
of baseline Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy was identified as the strongest risk factor for worsening 
neuropathy during bortezomib treatments. According to data submitted, the incidence of Grade ≥2 or 
Grade ≥3 events was higher despite of baseline sensory neuropathy (yes/no) in the IV group 
compared to the SC group. The observed reduced risk in peripheral neuropathy associated with the SC 
route was maintained after adjustment for cumulative dose and for region and was also apparent in 
patients with pre-existing neuropathy.  
Neurotoxicity is a problematic issue with almost all effective drugs available for patients and peripheral 
sensory neuropathy has been the main reason for dose modification or treatment discontinuation in 
the current clinical practise. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy with IV administered bortezomib 
was lower in the historical IV studies than in study MMY-3021: all grade peripheral neuropathy events 
(56% IV vs. 37% historical IV), Grade 2 events (42% IV vs. 27% historical IV), Grade 3 events 
(16% IV vs. 10% historical IV). A possible explanation might be the lower cumulative dose and shorter 
treatment duration in the earlier studies. However, it is evident that the incidence of peripheral 
neuropathy when analyzed for the same cumulative dose is lower in the SC treatment group than in 
the IV treatment group in the randomized SC studies and in the IV historical studies. 
Despite the apparent similar tolerability, the incidence of death was slightly higher in the SC group 
(27%) in comparison to the IV group (24%). Deaths from “Progressive disease” in study MMY-3021 
were twice as common in the SC Velcade group versus the IV Velcade group (18% vs. 9% 
respectively). This may partially be explained by the fact that the mean baseline KPS score was 90 in 
the IV treatment arm compared with 80 in the SC arm, reflecting poorer overall health in subjects in 
the SC arm at baseline. Another reason can lay in the imbalance in patients coming from Eastern 
Europe (66% in SC arm). In fact, the majority of the patients who died during this study were from 
Ukraine: 3/10 from the IV group and 16/30 (52%) from the SC group; patients from Ukraine were 
31% of all subjects enrolled from Eastern European countries (59%). In general, access to newer and 
more active therapies such as lenalidomide, thalidomide, doxorubicin, and VELCADE is more difficult in 
Eastern European countries.  
The principal SOC reporting more than 10% higher incidence rates in the SC group when compared to 
the IV group, was “investigations”. This difference was mainly due to “decreased weight” (14% 
incidence in the SC group vs 2% in the IV group). The incidence of weight decrease was mild to 
moderate in severity. Overall, body weight data showed that 71% of subjects in the SC treatment 
group and 69% of subjects in the IV treatment group lost weight during the study. Maximum weight 
loss of 5% to <10% (Grade 1) was reported in 22 % of subjects in the SC treatment group compared 
with 16% of subjects in the IV treatment group; this treatment difference was considered by the MAH 
not clinically relevant. 
Besides investigation SOC, significant higher incidence rates in the SC group were observed for 
adverse events falling in the following SOCs: renal and urinary disorders (e.g. renal failure and 
impairment) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (e.g. pruritus, rash, pyrexia). While the 
observed incidence rate of renal and urinary disorders in the IV arm (8%) was lower than the SC arm 
(14%), it should be noted that this observed incidence rate in the IV arm, based on a total of 86 
subjects, was substantially smaller than what was observed in the historical data of IV VELCADE (18%, 
243/1356). The 95% confidence intervals for the incidence rate of renal and urinary disorders were 3% 
to 16% for the IV arm, and 9% to 20% for the SC arm, which obviously overlap. The observed odds 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 47/58
 
 
 
 
ratio of SC vs. IV was 1.812 favouring the IV arm, and its 95% confidence interval was 0.706 to 5.243, 
which was quite wide with the lower boundary well below 1 (no difference). Similar arguments can be 
made for the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
In any case in the next PSURs, a trend analysis of events under SOCs Renal and urinary disorders and 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and the weight decrease, following IV and SC administration 
should be performed in order to decide whether to include certain events under strict monitoring. 
One case of Hypersensitivity reaction (SOC immune system disorders) was observed in the SC 
administration, in the pooled analysis between the two studies. 
Considering the pharmaceutical form (powder for solution for injection to be reconstituted) and the 
general precautions needed during preparation of cytotoxic agents, it is very unlikely that Velcade SC 
could be self-administered at home. As a precautionary measure, to avoid any potential harmful 
misuse, in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 6.6 of both IV and IV/SC annexes, should be clearly stated that 
Velcade must be reconstituted by an HCP in hospital.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics and section 4.8 has also been updated in line 
with the SmPC guideline. 
1.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
While safety data in many aspects were similar for the SC and IV administration routes, lower 
incidences for some relevant bortezomib related adverse events, were noted following SC dosing. The 
observed reduced risk in peripheral neuropathy associated with the SC route (38% SC vs. 53% IV) 
was maintained after adjustment for cumulative dose and for region and was also apparent in patients 
with pre-existing neuropathy. SC administration of VELCADE was locally well tolerated. 
Overall, the safety profile of bortezomib was confirmed to be well-characterised notwithstanding the 
route of administration used. However, since the limited SC use safety database, emerging safety 
issues could arise in the future.  
In the next PSURs, a trend analysis of events under SOCs Renal and urinary disorders and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders and the weight decrease, following IV and SC administration should be 
performed in order to decide whether to include certain events under strict monitoring.

The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, warns that acute 
development or exacerbation of congestive 
heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased 
left ventricular ejection fraction has been 
reported during bortezomib treatment. In a 
single agent Phase 3 randomised, 
comparative trial the incidence of heart 
failure in the VELCADE group was similar to 
that in the dexamethasone group. Fluid 
retention may be a predisposing factor for 
signs and symptoms of heart failure. 
Patients with risk factors for or existing heart 
disease should be closely monitored. 
SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
Effects) 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, warns that rare cases of 
hepatic failure have been reported in 
patients receiving multiple concomitant 
medicinal products and with serious 
underlying medical conditions. Other 
reported hepatic reactions include increases 
in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and 
hepatitis. Such changes may be reversible 
upon discontinuation of bortezomib.  
SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
Effects) 
The SmPC, Section 4.3 Contraindications 
includes hypersensitivity to bortezomib, 
boron, or to any of the excipients. 
The SmPC, Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects, 
identifies hypersensitivity, anaphylactic 
shock, Type III immune complex mediated 
reaction as uncommon or rare adverse 
reactions. 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, indicates that because 
bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can 
rapidly kill malignant plasma cells, the 
complications of TLS may occur. The patients 
at risk of TLS are those with high tumour 
burden prior to treatment. These patients 
should be monitored closely and appropriate 
precautions taken. 
SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
Effects) 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, warns that treatment 
with VELCADE is very commonly associated 
with peripheral neuropathy, which is 
predominantly sensory. However, cases of 
severe motor neuropathy with or without 
sensory peripheral neuropathy have been 
reported. Recommendations for dose 
modification in patients with neuropathy are 
provided in the SmPC, Section 4.2, Posology 
and Method of Administration.

VELCADE treatment. 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, warns that in addition to 
peripheral neuropathy, there may be a 
contribution of autonomic neuropathy to 
some adverse reactions such as postural 
hypotension and severe constipation with 
ileus.   
SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 (Undesirable

SmPC Section 4.3 contraindicates the use of 
VELCADE in patients with acute diffuse 
infiltrative pulmonary disease. The SmPC, 
Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, warns that there have 
been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative 
pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology in 
patients receiving VELCADE and that some of 
these events have been fatal. The SmPC 
recommends a pre-treatment chest 
radiograph.

SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
Effects) 
The SmPC, Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects, 
identifies pulmonary hypertension as a 
serious adverse reaction uncommonly 
reported during treatment with VELCADE. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC indicates that 
antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in 
patients being treated with VELCADE. The 
SmPC, Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects, 
identifies herpes zoster (including 
disseminated) as a common adverse 
reaction during treatment with VELCADE. 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, warns that there have 
been reports of PRES in patients receiving 
VELCADE. PRES is a rare, often reversible, 
rapidly evolving neurological condition which 
can present with seizure, hypertension, 
headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, 
and other visual and neurological 
disturbances. Brain imaging, preferably 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is used to 
confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing 
PRES, VELCADE should be discontinued. The 
safety of reinitiating VELCADE therapy in 
patients previously experiencing PRES is not 
known.

2.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The proposed SC route of administration represents a valuable alternative to IV injections that are 
inconvenient for patients with poor vein access.  
Bioequivalence in terms of systemic exposure, measured as AUC, between the SC and IV routes was 
demonstrated mainly by a dedicated randomised phase 1 PK/PD study (CAN-1004) involving patients 
with relapsed multiple myeloma after at least 1 prior treatment but naïve to Velcade. Both plasma 
concentration and proteasome inhibition activity were comparable. 
Efficacy of the SC administration was demonstrated in the pivotal phase 3 study MMY-3021.  
Compared to IV administration, Velcade given SC was non-inferior in terms of Overall Response Rate 
after 4 cycles (ORR 42% for both IV and SC routes). These results are in line with historical data of 
single-agent Velcade and are consistent with results from 1-year OS and PFS provided. 
Results from secondary efficacy endpoints also confirm that Velcade behaves in a similar way 
notwithstanding the administration route. 
Velcade X-47 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 53/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint of the pivotal trial MMY-3021, was ORR after 4 cycles, which is not ideal 
but since consistent results were obtained for the secondary efficacy endpoints, in particularly One 
year survival and PFS, this is not a concern. 
Based on the immaturity of survival data (32% of death events observed) and the rate (27.5%) of 
patients censored for progression events, efficacy results of Study MMY-3021 cannot be seen as final.  
Results for secondary endpoints were similar in both arms, albeit high rate of censored patients, TTP 
(53%), PFS (40%), 1-year survival rate (73%). Time and reason of censoring for disease progression, 
PFS and OS seems to be balanced between the two arms.  
The non-inferiority margin of 60% may potentially leaving uncertainties on the estimated efficacy. 
However, given the context of this particular non inferiority setting in which the same active substance 
is given by different routes of administration and PK data have confirmed similar overall exposure 
between IV and SC use, the point estimates, ORR both 42% for IV and SC use, can be considered 
reassuring as opposed to a formal conclusion of the non-inferiority.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Both studies CAN-1004 and MMY-3021 showed similar patterns of incidence of adverse events and 
adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation associated with SC and IV administration. 
Overall, the SC administration of Velcade was well tolerated, it showed an improved systemic safety 
profile when compared to the IV route with an acceptable local tolerability.  
In particular, one of the main safety results of the study was a lower incidence of peripheral 
neuropathy Grade ≥2 in the SC group with a ≥10% difference (33% SC vs. 44% IV). The observed 
reduced risk in peripheral neuropathy associated with the SC route was maintained after adjustment 
for cumulative dose and for region and was also apparent in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. 
Also the incidence of diarrhoea was decreased following SC vs IV administration (25% SC vs. 40% IV). 
Among the adverse events with a frequency higher than 10% in either treatment group IV and SC, 
were weight decrease and renal and urinary disorders (e.g. renal failure and impairment) (14% vs. 
8%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (e.g. pruritus, rash, pyrexia) (24% vs. 19%). 
One non serious case of hypersensitivity reactions (SOC immune system disorders) was observed in 
the SC administration, in the pooled analysis between the two studies. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The size of the safety database for SC administration is limited to 159 patients (Study CAN-1004 
N=24; 12 IV + 12 SC - Study MMY-3021 N=221; 74 IV + 147 SC). A Risk Management Plan is in place 
in order to adequately monitor any newly emerging safety signals.  
In the next PSURs, a trend analysis of events under SOCs Renal and urinary disorders and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders and the weight decrease, following IV and SC administration should be 
performed in order to decide whether to include certain events under strict monitoring.

Velcade is available as 3.5 mg and 1.0 mg vials. Only the 3.5 mg vial is to be used for SC injection to 
be reconstituted at a different concentration than for IV use. Therefore, there may be a potential for 
errors in reconstitution and in the route of administration. Furthermore, reports of fatal inadvertent 
administration errors via intrathecal route have been reported. As a consequence, a dual route (IV/SC) 
3.5 mg packaging with a concertina (flag) vial label, was clearly needed to report the reconstitution 
instructions for both IV and SC use (i.e., ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml to add and the amount per 
unit volume, 1 mg/ml for IV and 2.5 mg/ml for SC) and a warning regarding the route of 
administration. As a consequence a concertina (flag) vial label has been introduced. Furthermore, 
additional risk minimisation activities through educational materials for healthcare professionals as 
described in the RMP are needed in order to mitigate potential risk medication/dispensing error. 
Besides the SmPC, a Reconstitution, Dosing and Administration Booklet, a Reconstitution Poster 
visually describing the reconstitution instructions for Velcade IV and SC administrations to be affixed in 
the hospital units and a Dosing Slide Rule to determine the appropriate VELCADE dose were agreed. 
Moreover, training of HCPs (particularly oncologists, haematologists, haematology nurses, oncology 
nurses, hospital pharmacists, and other specialised personnel in charge of preparing chemotherapeutic 
drugs) on approved professional labelling, is considered in the objectives of Bortezomib Educational 
Program in Europe. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Given the equivalent systemic exposure and non-inferior efficacy demonstrated in the treated 
population, the treatment efficacy is expected to be the same for SC and IV administration in all the 
patient populations and indications for which VELCADE is administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 using 
the currently approved dosing schedule. 
Moreover, the new SC method of administrating bortezomib can be a valid option to treat patients with 
poor venous approach. 
While safety data in many aspects were similar for the SC and IV treatment groups, lower incidences 
for some relevant safety parameters were noted in the SC treatment group. The reduced risk in 
peripheral neuropathy associated with the SC route was maintained after adjustment for cumulative 
dose and for region and was also apparent in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. This is of 
importance as neurotoxicity is a problematic issue with almost all effective drugs available for patients 
and peripheral sensory neuropathy has been the main reason for dose modification or treatment 
discontinuation in the current clinical practise.  
Subcutaneous administration of VELCADE was locally well tolerated. The majority of local injection site 
reactions were redness, of mild or moderate intensity, and resolved in all cases. 
Benefit-risk balance 
SC administration was shown to have similar efficacy and safety profiles as the IV administration. The 
SC route of administration is considered an additional tool to potentially improve patient compliance 
and treatment efficacy in a patient population that is not suitable for IV administration particularly in 
patients with poor venous access. However, since the safety database on the use of the SC route is 
small, risk minimisation measures are proposed to monitor emerging safety issues that could arise 
particularly potential medical errors.

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Taken together, the benefits of the proposed subcutaneous administration of bortezomib outweigh the 
risks associated with this new route of administration. 
3.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Velcade is not similar to Revlimid and Thalidomide 
Celgene within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Velcade 3.5mg powder for solution for injection for subcutaneous use, 
as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at 
least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow 
transplantation and in combination with melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with bone 
marrow transplant, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the extension of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

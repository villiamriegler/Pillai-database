with imatinib or after discontinuation has been 
observed in post-marketing. The Package Leaflet has

taken the opportunity to merge the SmPCs of the 
different strengths of the same pharmaceutical form 
i.e. 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules, and 100 mg 
and 400 mg film coated tablets, respectively, and to

An observational registry (study L2401) was conducted to 
the CHMP, to reflect the results of Study 
CSTI571L2401, an observational registry collecting 
long-term safety and efficacy data in patients with 
myeloid neoplasms with platelet derived growth 
factor receptor beta rearrangement (MPN with 
PDGFRB rearrangement) treated with imatinib 
mesylate, in fulfilment of the post-authorisation 
measure MEA 168.8. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
collect long-term safety and efficacy data in patients 
suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms with PDGFR- β 
rearrangement and who were treated with Glivec. The 23 
patients enrolled in this registry received Glivec at a 
median daily dose of 264 mg (range: 100 to 400 mg) for a 
median duration of 7.2 years (range 0.1 to 12.7 years). 
Due to the observational nature of this registry, 
haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular assessment data 
were available for 22, 9 and 17 of the 23 enrolled patients, 
respectively. When assuming conservatively that patients 
with missing data were non-responders, CHR was observed 
in 20/23 (87%) patients, CCyR in 9/23 (39.1%) patients, 
and MR in 11/23 (47.8%) patients, respectively. When the 
response rate is calculated from patients with at least one 
valid assessment, the response rate for CHR, CCyR and MR 
was 20/22 (90.9%), 9/9 (100%) and 11/17 (64.7%), 
respectively.

The MAH provided the results of the pregnancy registry 
Study CSTI571A2403: “A global Gleevec/Glivec and 
Tasigna Pregnancy Exposure Registry” (Category 3). 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
CSTI571A2403 with the objective to monitor pregnancies 
exposed to imatinib in order to estimate the prevalence of 
birth defects. An analysis of the scientific literature of 
pregnancy women treated with imatinib was also provided 
in the context of this variation. In view of the information 
gathered, a possible role of imatinib in causing foetal 
Page 18/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anomalies could not be completely ruled out. Therefore, an 
update to section 4.6 of the SmPC was agreed to reflect the 
know information the issue, to read as follows: 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to use 
effective contraception during treatment.  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data on the use of imatinib in pregnant 
women. There have been post-marketing reports of 
spontaneous abortions and infant congenital anomalies 
from women who have taken Glivec. Studies in animals 
have however shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) 
and the potential risk for the foetus is unknown. Glivec 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary. If it is used during pregnancy, the patient must 
be informed of the potential risk to the foetus.

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this

also proposed to the SmPC.

patients treated with Glivec was conducted by the MAH 
following the PRAC request further to the assessment of the 
PSUR covering the period 11 May 2009 to 10 May 2012. 
The MAH retrieved 12 cases of DRESS. Three of the 
reported cases had a positive re-challenge (patients re-
experienced the reaction after reintroduction of Glivec). 
Three cases showed a positive de-challenge (patient 
recovering after drug withdrawal). In one case the DRESS 
was confirmed with a skin biopsy. The section 4.8 of the 
SmPC was therefore updated to add DRESS as an adverse 
drug reaction.

in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9.0.

effects upon growth, delay in vaginal opening and preputial 
separation were observed at approximately 0.3 to 2 times

was observed in juvenile animals (around weaning phase) 
at approximately 2 times the average paediatric exposure 
at the highest recommended dose of 340 mg/m2.

data reported in paediatric subjects appear to be replicating 
the adults’ outcomes, for all indications but GIST. However,

A randomised phase III study (CSTI571BFI03) comparing 
administration of the SmPC to indicate that the 
length of treatment in the clinical trial supporting the 
adjuvant treatment of adult patients following 
resection of GIST was 36 months following results of 
the CSTI571BFI03 study (FUM 180). Section 5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC has also 
been updated to reflect the efficacy data of the 
study. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
the 12-month vs 36-month administration of imatinib in 
high risk patients of recurrence in the adjuvant treatment 
of adult patients following resection of GIST has been 
carried out. Outcomes from the primary endpoint, 
Recurrence free survival (RFS), have shown a positive 
result with a HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.32-0.65). RFS 
probability estimates at 12 months were 93.7% in the 12-
month arm and 95.9% in the 36-month arm. Interestingly, 
the difference increased at 60.1% vs 86.6% at 36 months 
respectively. All the sensitivity analyses on the primary 
endpoint support this finding. In addition, even though the 
data on OS are not fully mature, OS results are in favour of 
36-month treatment arm, HR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.22-0.89). 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC was therefore updated to indicate 
that the length of treatment in the clinical trial supporting 
the adjuvant treatment of adult patients following resection 
of GIST was 36 months following results of the 
CSTI571BFI03 study and section 5.1 of the SmPC was

The MAH has conducted a systematic review of information 
the MAH updated section 5.1 of the SmPC to include 
a mechanism of action sub-section. In addition 
existing information in section 4.5 of the SmPC 
related to interactions with medicinal products were

included in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
on the mechanism of action of imatinib from the published 
literature. As a result of these publications imatinib could 
be an inhibitor of DDR1 and DDR2 tyrosine kinase 
autophosphorylation which can be included together with 
the previously established mechanism of action in section 
5.1 of the SmPC. Other modifications of sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 4.5 of the SmPC have been introduced in order to 
reduce redundancy in the text and improve clarity.

TLS (FUM 184).   
A search of the Global database retrieved 61 reports of 
tumour lysis. Upon medical review it was determined that 
11 reports were not to be considered TLS under the case 
definition. It was also determined that 1 additional report of 
TLS was not related to Glivec. Based on the review of the 
50 remaining reports, a causal relationship between TLS 
and Glivec treatment is deemed to be possible.

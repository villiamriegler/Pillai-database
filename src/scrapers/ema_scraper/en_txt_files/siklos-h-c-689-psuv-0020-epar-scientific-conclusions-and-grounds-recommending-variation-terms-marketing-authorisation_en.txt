Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Siklos, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
“Preliminary results of the HYDREP study were provided in March 2013. Sperm results were available for 
the  majority  of  patients:  63%  of  the  trial  population,  corresponding  to  31  patients  of  the  49  patients 
included,  for  whom  follow-up  sperm  results  after  6  months  of  hydroxycarbamide  treatment  were 
available.  The  preliminary  results  show  that  there  is  a  statistically  significant  impairment  in  all  sperm 
parameters after a 6 months HU therapy. The rapporteur acknowledges that these results may vary with 
the  final  analysis.  However  they  are  evocative  of  a  risk  of  male  fertility  impairment  after  6  months  of 
treatment  with  SIKLOS.In  view  of  available  data,  the  PRAC  considers  that  the  changes  to  the  product 
information proposed by the MAH should be amended. The frequency of azoospermia and oligospermia in 
the SmPC/PL should be changed from “very rare” to “very common”.  The proposed changes to sections 
4.6  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC  and  the  leaflet  are  detailed  in  Annex  1  of  this  assessment  report.  However,  a 
further update to the SmPC might be needed, if final study results become available in 2014.” 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Siklos, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance HYDROXYCARBAMIDE is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

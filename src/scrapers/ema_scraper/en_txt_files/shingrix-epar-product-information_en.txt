CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Shingrix is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in: 
•  adults 50 years of age or older; 
•  adults 18 years of age or older at increased risk of HZ. 
The use of Shingrix should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The primary vaccination schedule consists of two doses of 0.5 mL each: an initial dose followed by a 
second dose 2 months later. 
If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 
and 6 months after the first dose (see section 5.1). 
For subjects who are or might become immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy, 
and  whom  would  benefit from a  shorter  vaccination schedule, the  second  dose can  be  given  1 to  2 
months after the initial dose (see section 5.1). 
The need for booster doses following the primary vaccination schedule has not been established (see 
section 5.1). 
Shingrix can be given with the same schedule in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated 
HZ vaccine (see section 5.1).

Shingrix is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Shingrix in children and adolescents have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications   
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Prior to immunisation 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
As with other vaccines, vaccination with Shingrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an 
acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not 
result in the deferral of vaccination. 
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. 
The vaccine is for prophylactic use only and is not intended for treatment of established clinical 
disease. 
Shingrix should not be administered intravascularly or intradermally. 
Subcutaneous administration is not recommended. 
Maladministration via the subcutaneous route may lead to an increase in transient local reactions.  
Shingrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder since bleeding may occur following intramuscular administration to these subjects. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
In a post-marketing observational study in individuals aged 65 years or older, an increased risk of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (estimated 3 excess cases per million doses administered) was observed 
during the 42 days following vaccination with Shingrix. Available information is insufficient to 
determine a causal relationship with Shingrix.

There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support replacing a dose of Shingrix with a 
dose of another HZ vaccine. 
There are limited data to support the use of Shingrix in individuals with a history of HZ (see section 
5.1). Healthcare professionals therefore need to weigh the benefits and risks of HZ vaccination on an 
individual basis. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially  
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Shingrix can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine,  
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23), 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13), reduced antigen diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa), or coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine. The vaccines should be administered 
at different injection sites. 
In  five phase III, controlled, open-label clinical studies, adults ≥ 50 years of age were randomised to 
receive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart administered either concomitantly at the first dose or 
non-concomitantly with an unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (N=828; Zoster-004), 
a PPV23 vaccine (N=865; Zoster-035), a PCV13 vaccine (N=912; Zoster-059), a dTpa vaccine 
formulated with 0.3 milligrams Al3+ (N=830; Zoster-042), or a monovalent COVID-19 mRNA-1273 
50 micrograms booster vaccine (Original SARS-CoV-2 strain) (N=539; Zoster-091). The immune 
responses of the co-administered vaccines were unaffected, with the exception of lower geometric 
mean concentrations (GMCs) for one of the pertussis antigens (pertactin) when Shingrix is 
co-administered with the dTpa vaccine. The clinical relevance of this data is not known.  
The adverse reactions of fever and shivering were more frequent when PPV23 vaccine was 
co-administered with Shingrix (16% and 21%, respectively) compared to when Shingrix was given 
alone (7% for both adverse reactions). 
In adults aged 50 years and above, systemic adverse reactions that are very commonly reported (see 
Table 1; such as myalgia 32.9%, fatigue 32.2%, and headache 26.3%), and arthralgia, uncommonly 
reported, following administration of Shingrix alone were reported with increased frequency when 
Shingrix was co-administered with a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (myalgia 64%, fatigue 51.7%, 
headache 39%, arthralgia 30.3%).  
Concomitant use with other vaccines than those listed above is not recommended due to lack of data. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Shingrix in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or 
post-natal development (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Shingrix during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effect on breast-fed infants of administration of Shingrix to their mothers has not been studied. 
It is unknown whether Shingrix is excreted in human milk. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects with respect to fertility in males or females 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Shingrix may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines in the 2- 
3 days following vaccination. Fatigue and malaise may occur following administration (see section 
4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
In adults aged 50 years and above, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the 
injection site (68.1% overall/dose; 3.8% severe/dose), myalgia (32.9% overall/dose; 2.9% 
severe/dose), fatigue (32.2% overall/dose; 3.0% severe/dose) and headache (26.3% overall/dose; 1.9% 
severe/dose). Most of these reactions were not long-lasting (median duration of 2 to 3 days). Reactions 
reported as severe lasted 1 to 2 days. 
In adults ≥ 18 years of age who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy 
(referred to as immunocompromised (IC)), the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 
adults 50 years and above. There are limited data in adults aged 18-49 years at increased risk of HZ 
who are not IC. 
Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: 
- 
studies in IC adults ≥ 18 years of age (pooled analysis): the incidence of pain at the injection site, 
fatigue, myalgia, headache, shivering and fever was higher in adults aged 18-49 years compared to 
those aged 50 years and above. 
studies in adults ≥ 50 years of age (pooled analysis): the incidence of myalgia, fatigue, headache, 
shivering, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in adults aged 50-69 years compared to 
those aged 70 years and above. 
- 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The safety profile presented below is based on a pooled analysis of data generated in placebo-
controlled clinical studies on 5 887 adults 50-69 years of age and 8 758 adults ≥ 70 years of age. 
In clinical studies in IC adults ≥ 18 years of age (1 587 subjects) the safety profile is consistent with 
the data presented in Table 1 below. 
Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing surveillance are also tabulated below.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties   
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, varicella zoster vaccines, ATC code: J07BK03. 
Mechanism of action 
By combining the VZV specific antigen (gE) with an adjuvant system (AS01B), Shingrix is designed 
to induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in individuals with pre-existing 
immunity against VZV. 
Non-clinical data show that AS01B induces a local and transient activation of the innate immune 
system through specific molecular pathways. This facilitates the recruitment and activation of antigen 
presenting cells carrying gE-derived antigens in the draining lymph node, which in turn leads to the 
generation of gE-specific CD4+ T cells and antibodies. The adjuvant effect of AS01B is the result of 
interactions between MPL and QS-21 formulated in liposomes.

Clinical efficacy of Shingrix 
Efficacy against Herpes Zoster (HZ) and Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 
Two phase III, placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy studies of Shingrix were conducted in 
adults ≥ 50 years with 2 doses administered 2 months apart: 
- 
ZOE-50 (Zoster-006): Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) of 15 405 adults ≥ 50 years who received 
at least one dose of either Shingrix (N=7 695) or placebo (N=7 710). 
ZOE-70 (Zoster-022): TVC of 13 900 adults ≥ 70 years who received at least one dose of either 
Shingrix (N=6 950) or placebo (N=6 950). 
- 
The studies were not designed to demonstrate efficacy in subgroups of frail individuals, including 
those with multiple comorbidities, although these subjects were not excluded from the studies. 
Two phase III, placebo-controlled, observer-blind studies evaluating Shingrix efficacy were conducted 
in IC adults ≥ 18 years with 2 doses administered 1-2 months apart: 
- 
Zoster-002: TVC of 1 846 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants (aHSCT) recipients 
who received at least one dose of either Shingrix (N=922) or placebo (N=924) 50-70 days post-
transplant, 21.3% (Shingrix) and 20.5% (placebo) of the subjects received at least one 
immunosuppressive (IS) treatment (for a duration of at least one day) from HSCT up to 30 days 
after Dose 2 (TVC). The proportion of subjects by underlying disease was: 53.1% (Shingrix) 
and 53.4% (placebo) for multiple myeloma (MM) and 46.9% (Shingrix) and 46.6% (placebo) 
for other diagnosis. 
Zoster-039: TVC of 562 subjects with hematologic malignancies who received at least one dose 
of either Shingrix (N=283) or placebo (N=279) during a cancer therapy course (37%) or after 
the full cancer therapy course (63%). The proportion of subjects by underlying disease was: 
70.7% (Shingrix) and 71.3% (placebo) for MM and other diseases, 14.5% (Shingrix) and 14.0% 
(placebo) for non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL) and 14.8% (Shingrix) and 14.7% 
(placebo) for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). 
- 
These studies were not designed to assess the impact of concomitant use of IS therapy on vaccine 
efficacy or to assess the impact of specific IS treatments on vaccine efficacy. Most vaccine recipients 
were not under IS therapy at the time of vaccination (see above). Not all types of IS therapies were 
used in the populations studied. 
Incidence of HZ and PHN cases as well as vaccine efficacy were evaluated in the modified Total 
Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC), i.e. excluding adults who did not receive the second dose of vaccine or 
who had a confirmed diagnosis of HZ within one month after the second dose. 
Shingrix significantly decreased the incidence of HZ compared with placebo in: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
adults ≥ 50 years (ZOE-50): 6 vs. 210 cases; 
adults ≥ 70 years (pooled analysis of ZOE-50 and ZOE-70): 25 vs. 284 cases; 
adults ≥ 18 years with aHSCT (Zoster-002): 49 vs. 135 cases; 
adults ≥ 18 years with hematologic malignancies (Zoster-039): 2 vs. 14 cases. Vaccine efficacy 
was calculated post-hoc. 
Vaccine efficacy results against HZ are presented in Table 2.

antiviral prophylaxis in line with the local standard of care was permitted 
Approximately 13 000 subjects with underlying medical conditions, including conditions associated 
with a higher risk of HZ, were enrolled in ZOE-50 and ZOE-70. Post-hoc analysis of efficacy against 
confirmed HZ undertaken in patients with common conditions (chronic kidney disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, depression or diabetes mellitus), indicates that 
the vaccine efficacy is aligned with the overall HZ efficacy. 
Shingrix significantly decreased the incidence of PHN compared with placebo in:

Not statistically significant 
antiviral prophylaxis in line with the local standard of care was permitted 
The benefit of Shingrix in the prevention of PHN can be attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the 
prevention of HZ. A further reduction of PHN incidence in subjects with confirmed HZ could not be 
demonstrated due to the limited number of HZ cases in the vaccine group. 
In the fourth year after vaccination, the efficacy against HZ was 93.1% (95% CI: 81.2; 98.2) and 
87.9% (95% CI: 73.3; 95.4) in adults ≥ 50 years (ZOE-50) and adults ≥ 70 years (pooled ZOE-50 and 
ZOE-70), respectively. 
The duration of protection beyond 4 years is currently under investigation. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
In Zoster-002, during a follow-up period starting 1 month post-dose 2 (i.e. corresponding to 
approximately 6 months after aHSCT) until 1 year after aHSCT, when the risk for HZ is the highest, 
the efficacy against HZ was 76.2% (95% CI: 61.1; 86.0). 
Efficacy against HZ-related complications other than PHN 
The evaluated HZ-related complications (other than PHN) were: HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, 
ophthalmic disease, neurologic disease including stroke, and visceral disease. In the pooled analysis of 
ZOE-50 and ZOE-70, Shingrix significantly reduced these HZ-related complications by 93.7% (95% 
CI: 59.5; 99.9) and 91.6% (95% CI: 43.3; 99.8) in adults ≥ 50 years (1 vs. 16 cases) and adults ≥ 70 
years (1 vs. 12 cases), respectively. No cases of visceral disease or stroke were reported during these 
studies. 
In Zoster-002, Shingrix significantly reduced HZ-related complications by 77.8% (95% CI: 19.0; 96.0) 
in aHSCT recipients ≥ 18 years (3 vs 13 cases). 
In addition, in Zoster-002, Shingrix significantly reduced HZ-related hospitalisations by 84.7% (95% 
CI: 32.1; 96.6) (2 vs. 13 cases). 
Effect of Shingrix on HZ-related pain 
Overall in ZOE-50 and ZOE-70, there was a general trend towards less severe HZ-related pain in 
subjects vaccinated with Shingrix compared to placebo. As a consequence of the high vaccine efficacy 
against HZ, a low number of breakthrough cases were accrued, and it was therefore not possible to 
draw firm conclusions on these study objectives. 
In subjects ≥ 70 years with at least one confirmed HZ episode (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 pooled), Shingrix 
significantly reduced the use and the duration of HZ-related pain medication by 39.0% (95% CI: 11.9; 
63.3) and 50.6% (95% CI: 8.8; 73.2), respectively. The median duration of pain medication use was 
32.0 and 44.0 days in the Shingrix and placebo group, respectively. 
In subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode, Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum 
average pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 3.9 vs. 5.5, P-value = 0.049 and 
mean = 4.5 vs. 5.6, P-value = 0.043, in subjects ≥ 50 years (ZOE-50) and ≥ 70 years (ZOE-50 and 
ZOE-70 pooled), respectively). In addition, in subjects ≥ 70 years (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 pooled), 
Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum worst pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ 
episode (mean = 5.7 vs. 7.0, P-value = 0.032). 
The burden-of-illness (BOI) score incorporates the incidence of HZ with the severity and duration of 
acute and chronic HZ-related pain over a 6 month period following rash onset. 
The efficacy in reducing BOI was 98.4% (95% CI: 92.2; 100) in subjects ≥ 50 years (ZOE-50) and 
92.1% (95% CI: 90.4; 93.8) in subjects ≥ 70 years (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 pooled). 
In Zoster-002, Shingrix significantly reduced the duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain by 
38.5% (95% CI: 11.0; 57.6) in aHSCT recipients ≥ 18 years with at least one confirmed HZ episode. 
Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum average pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ 
episode (mean = 4.7 vs. 5.7, P-value = 0.018) and the maximum worst pain score versus placebo over 
the entire HZ episode (mean = 5.8 vs. 7.1, P-value = 0.011). 
The percentage of subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode in Zoster-002 using at least one 
pain medication was 65.3% and 69.6% in the Shingrix and placebo group, respectively. The median 
duration of pain medication use was 21.5 and 47.5 days in the Shingrix and placebo group, 
respectively. 
Additionally, in Zoster-002, the efficacy in reducing BOI score was 82.5% (95% CI: 73.6%, 91.4%).

Immunogenicity of Shingrix 
An immunological correlate of protection has not been established; therefore the level of immune 
response that provides protection against HZ is unknown. 
In adults ≥ 50 years, the immune responses to Shingrix, given as 2 doses 2 months apart, were 
evaluated in a subset of subjects from the phase III efficacy studies ZOE-50 [humoral immunity and 
cell-mediated immunity (CMI)] and ZOE-70 (humoral immunity). The gE-specific immune responses 
(humoral and CMI) elicited by Shingrix are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

CD4+ T cell activity was not assessed in ZOE-70 
Data from a phase II, open-label, single group, follow-up clinical study in adults ≥ 60 years (Zoster-
024) indicate that the vaccine-induced immune response (humoral and CMI) persists up to 
approximately 6 years following a 0, 2-month schedule (N= 119). The median anti-gE antibody 
concentration was greater than 7-fold above the baseline pre-vaccination median concentration. The 
median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells was greater than 3.7-fold above baseline 
pre-vaccination median frequency. 
In IC adults ≥ 18 years, the humoral and CMI responses to Shingrix, given as 2 doses 1-2 months 
apart, were evaluated in: 
- 
one phase I/II study: Zoster-015 (HIV infected subjects, the majority (76.42%) being stable on 
antiretroviral therapy (for at least one year) with a CD4 T-cell count ≥ 200 /mm3); 
one phase II/III study: Zoster-028 (patients with solid tumours undergoing chemotherapy); 
three phase III studies: Zoster-002 (aHSCT recipients vaccinated post-transplant), Zoster-039 
(patients with hematologic malignancies vaccinated during a cancer therapy course or after the 
full cancer therapy course) and Zoster-041 (renal transplant recipients on chronic 
immunosuppressive treatment at the time of vaccination).

Immunogenicity in subjects receiving 2 doses of Shingrix 6 months apart 
Efficacy has not been assessed for the 0, 6-month schedule. 
In a phase III, open-label clinical study (Zoster-026) where 238 adults ≥ 50 years of age were equally 
randomised to receive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 or 6 months apart, the humoral immune response 
following the 0, 6-month schedule was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the response with the 0, 
2-month schedule. The anti-gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 38 153.7 mIU/mL

Subjects with a history of HZ prior to vaccination 
Subjects with a history of HZ were excluded from ZOE-50 and ZOE-70. In a phase III, uncontrolled, 
open-label clinical study (Zoster-033), 96 adults ≥ 50 years of age with a physician-documented 
history of HZ received 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart. Laboratory confirmation of HZ cases was 
not part of the study procedures. The anti-gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 
47 758.7 mIU/mL (95% CI: 42 258.8; 53 974.4). 
There were 9 reports of suspected HZ in 6 subjects over a one-year follow up period. This is a higher 
recurrence rate than generally reported in observational studies in unvaccinated individuals with a 
history of HZ. (See section 4.4) 
Immunogenicity in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine 
In a phase III, open-label, multicentre clinical study (Zoster-048), a 2 dose schedule of Shingrix 2 
months apart was assessed in 215 adults ≥ 65 years of age with a previous history of vaccination with 
live attenuated HZ vaccine ≥ 5 years earlier compared to 215 matched subjects who had never 
received live attenuated HZ vaccine. The immune response to Shingrix was unaffected by prior 
vaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Shingrix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of Varicella Zoster Virus 
reactivation (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

1.  What Shingrix is and what it is used for  
What Shingrix is used for 
Shingrix is a vaccine that helps to protect adults against shingles (herpes zoster) and post-herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles. 
Shingrix is given to:  
•  adults 50 years and above; 
•  adults 18 years and above who are at increased risk of shingles. 
Shingrix cannot be used to prevent chickenpox (varicella). 
What shingles is 
• 
Shingles is a rash with blisters that is often painful. It usually occurs in one part of the body and 
can last for several weeks. 
•  Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox.  
•  After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. 
• 
Sometimes, after many years, if your immune system (the body’s natural defences) becomes 
weaker (due to age, an illness or a medicine you are taking), the virus can cause shingles. 
Complications related to shingles 
Shingles may lead to complications.  
The most common complication of shingles is: 
• 
long-lasting nerve pain – called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. After the shingles blisters heal, 
you may get pain which can last for months or years and may be severe. 
Other complications of shingles are: 
• 
• 
scars where the blisters have been. 
skin infections, weakness, muscle paralysis and loss of hearing or vision – these are less 
common. 
How Shingrix works 
Shingrix reminds your body about the virus that causes shingles. This helps your immune system (the 
body’s natural defences) stay prepared to fight the virus and protect you against shingles and its 
complications. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Shingrix  
You must not be given Shingrix if 
• 
you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and 
swelling of the face or tongue. 
You must not be given Shingrix if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you receive Shingrix if: 
• 
you have a severe infection with a high temperature (fever). In these cases, the vaccination may 
have to be postponed until you have recovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a 
problem, but talk to your doctor first; 
you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you 
receive Shingrix. 
Fainting can occur before or after any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted 
with a previous injection. 
Shingrix cannot be used as a treatment if you already have shingles or shingles-related complications. 
As with all vaccines, Shingrix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. 
Talk to your doctor if you experience temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness, 
and paralysis (called Guillain-Barré syndrome) after receiving Shingrix. A slightly increased risk of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (estimated 3 additional cases per million doses administered) has been 
reported in people aged 65 years and above after receiving Shingrix. 
Other medicines and Shingrix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or have recently received any other 
vaccine. 
Shingrix can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal 
influenza vaccine, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine, reduced antigen diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis vaccine, or COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine. A different injection site will be used for each vaccine. 
You may be more likely to experience fever and/or shivering when 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine is given at the same time as Shingrix.  
You may be more likely to experience chills, tiredness, fever, stomach and digestive complaints 
(including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or stomach pain), headache, muscle pain, or joint pain 
when a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is given at the same time as Shingrix.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects mentioned below in section 4 “Possible side effects” may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shingrix contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How Shingrix is given  
• 
• 
• 
Shingrix is given as an injection into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). 
You will receive 2 injections 2 months apart. If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is 
necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 and 6 months after the first dose.  
Based on your medical condition, your doctor may also recommend that you receive the second 
injection 1 month after the first injection.  
You will be informed when you should come back for the second dose of Shingrix. 
Make sure you finish the complete vaccination course. This will maximise the protection offered by 
Shingrix. 
Shingrix can be given if you have already been vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster 
vaccine. Speak to your doctor for more information. 
4.

In addition, updates are proposed in the package leaflet in 
relation to NSAIDs as well as on sexual dysfunction to align 
SmPC wording.

PK of vortioxetine in the paediatric population based 
on final results from studies 12709A, 12712A and 
12712B.  
Study 12709A is an interventional, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-reference 
(fluoxetine), fixed-dose study of vortioxetine in 
paediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years, with Major 
Depressive Disorder (MDD) to evaluate efficacy and 
safety. Whereas studies 12712A and 12712B are 2 
open-label, long-term safety and efficacy studies in 
children and adolescents: one 6-month extension 
study (Study 12712A) to Studies 12709A and 
12710A, and one 18-month extension study (Study 
12712B) to Study 12712A. In addition, updates are 
proposed in section 4.5 and package leaflet section 2 
in relation to NSAIDs as well as updates to the 
Package leaflet section 4 to align SmPC wording on 
sexual dysfunction. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

In the iMAA of Brintellix (vortioxetine), to ensure a 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC to describe the 
effects of vortioxetine on treatment-emergent sexual 
dysfunction based on the outcome of the clinical 
studies 318 and 4001. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 5.2 to reflect the outcome 
of pharmacokinetic study 401 in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment. Section 4.2 is also updated to 
add a cross reference to section 4.4 and 5.2 for 
hepatic impairment and section 4.4 wording for renal 
impairment is aligned to the one regarding hepatic 
impairment.

systematic evaluation of sexual dysfunction besides the 
spontaneous collection of adverse events (AEs), the Arizona 
Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) was used in a number of 
studies. In addition to the spontaneously reported AEs, the 
proportion of subjects who shifted from normal to abnormal 
according to the ASEX is described in the SmPC. These data 
indicate that the risk of developing Treatment-Emergent 
Sexual Dysfunction (TESD) with vortioxetine is low. In 
order to further investigate the risk of developing 
Treatment-Emergent Sexual Dysfunction (TESD) with 
vortioxetine, two active-comparator clinical studies 318 and 
4001 were performed. The CHMP agrees to reflect the 
outcome of these studies in section 5.1 of the SmPC.   
Study 401 investigated the pharmacokinetics of 
vortioxetine and its metabolites in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment. The CHMP agrees to reflect the 
outcome of the study in section 5.2 of the SmPC and 
update section 4.4 regarding the limited data available and 
caution to be exercised when treating patients with hepatic 
impairment.

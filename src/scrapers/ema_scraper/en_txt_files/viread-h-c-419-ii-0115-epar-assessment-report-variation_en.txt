1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
polymerase inhibitor. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF, TDF, Viread) is the fumarate salt of 
tenofovir disoproxil, a prodrug of TFV. 
Viread tablets (containing 245 mg of TDF as fumarate, equivalent to 300 mg TDF or 136 mg of TFV) 
once daily were approved on 5 February 2002 for use in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) 
agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults. Viread 
was subsequently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B on 23 April 2008. 
Viread tablets are approved in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for use in HIV-1-infected 
adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 35 kg). In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that available clinical data in HIV-1 infected, ARV 
treatment-experienced adolescents were inadequate to support the use of TDF in this population 
(Viread variation EMEA/H/C/00419/II/0098).  Furthermore, the application for Viread line extension 
EMEA/H/C/00419/X/105/G in the treatment of HIV infection in children aged 2 to <12 years is under 
evaluation. 
Cumulative patient exposure to TDF (for both the HIV-1 and HBV indications combined) since first 
marketing approval in the US in 2001 until 31 August 2011 is estimated to be more than 4.4 million 
patient-years of treatment. 
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical data have been presented with this variation. 
1.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA has been submitted in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83 requirements.

Table 2.  Tabular overview of clinical studies  
1.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Initial clinical studies were undertaken using an oral suspension formulation (GS-02-983 in HIV-1 
infected subjects 2 to 8 years of age) and 75-mg tablets of tenofovir DF (GS-01-926 and GS-01-927 in 
HIV-1 infected subjects 6 to 16 years of age). Each of these studies included pharmacokinetic 
assessments for all subjects. Based on data from these studies, the dose of tenofovir DF selected for 
investigation in subsequent studies was 8 mg/kg of actual body weight to a maximum of 300 mg/day (
≥ 35 kg). 
Table 3.  Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in HIV-1 Infected Pediatric Subjects 
In adolescents, the efficacy and safety of TDF is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 study (GS-US-
104-0321) of HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced adolescents (12 to 18 years of age and with a 
body weight ≥ 35 kg) who were failing to achieve virologic suppression on their existing antiretroviral 
regimen. In this pivotal study, TFV pharmacokinetics were examined in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent 
subjects receiving the TDF 300-mg tablet once daily plus a background antiretroviral regimen for at 
least 4 weeks. Steady-state TFV exposures achieved in these subjects (AUCtau 3390.6 ng•h/mL, Cmax 
377.5 ng/mL, and Tmax 1.98 hours) were similar to those observed in HIV-1 infected adults receiving 
TDF 300 mg/day. 
Pharmacokinetic data are also available from 7 HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to < 18 years of age who 
received multiple doses of TDF 300 mg once daily (4 × 75 mg tablets) in earlier Phase 1/2 Studies GS-
01-926 and GS-01-927 (combined data). Tenofovir was rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 2.08 
hours and mean Cmax of 268.3 ng/mL. A mean AUCtau of 3007.8 ng•h/mL and a median T½ of 13.99 
hours were achieved.

Overall in adults, the same dose is recommended for treating HIV and HBV chronic infections. As for 
HIV infected adolescents a 8 mg/kg weight based dose has been selected as mimicking the adults 
exposure to predict similar efficacy/safety. For HIV and HBV clinical development adolescents were 
receiving the adult dose (i.e. maximal dose). 
PK data in HBV-infected adolescents in study GS-US-174-0115 
Pharmacokinetics of TDF was assessed in 52 adolescent aged 12 to 17 years who took part in the 
pivotal trial (Study GS-US-174-0115). 
Results 
Mean and median TDF pharmacokinetic parameters from exploratory analyses are shown in the table 3 
below overall in adolescent patients and in the subset of patients 12 to 14 years or 15 to 17 years of 
age. Due to the lack of data over a wide range of sampling interval, AUC and half-life determinations 
were not performed in adolescents in the 12-to-14 years of age subset.  
Table 4.  GS-US-174-0115: Mean and Median TDF Pharmacokinetic Parameters from Exploratory 
Analyses (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set) 
Discussion 
TFV exposures in the adolescent population with CHB in Study GS-US-174-0115 were generally 
comparable with historical data from HIV-1 infected adult and adolescent subjects, as well as from 
adult healthy subjects (see historical data in the table 4 below).

Table 5.   TFV Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Multiple Doses of Tenofovir DF 300 mg/day in 
HBV Infected Adolescents, and Comparative Data in HIV-1 Infected Adolescents and Adults 
For the overall population (adolescents from 12 to 17 years) data show that peak plasma 
concentrations of TDF were more rapidly achieved (Tmax 1.5 h) than in HIV-infected patients (Tmax 
around 2-3 h). Given that the recommended dose for adults infected with HIV and HBV is the same, 
the comparison seems acceptable. 
PK data were also provided for the subset of patients 12 to 14 and 15 to 17 years of age. Data showed 
that Cmax is higher for younger children while Tmax is similar for both subsets of adolescents. Data on 
AUC and half-life are lacking for children of 12 to 14 years of age. 
In adults, the same dose is recommended for treating HIV and HBV chronic infections.  
As for HIV infected adolescents a 8 mg/kg weight based dose has been selected as mimicking the 
adults exposure to predict similar efficacy/safety. For HIV and HBV clinical development adolescents 
were in fact receiving the adult dose (i.e. maximal dose). 
1.4.  Clinical efficacy  
1.4.1.  Main study: GS-US-174-0115 
The  proposed  indication  is  supported  by  study  GS-US-174-0115,  a  long-term,  phase  3,  randomized, 
double-blind  controlled  trial  that  is  currently  ongoing  as  a  TDF  open-label  study.  Clinical  data  coming 
from Studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 in adults also support these results.

Methods 
•  Study Design 
Study  GS-US-174-0115  was  a  randomized,  Double-Blind  Evaluation  of  the  Antiviral  Efficacy,  Safety, 
and Tolerability of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Versus Placebo in Adolescents with Chronic Hepatitis 
B  Infection.  Subjects  were  treated  with  blinded  randomized  therapy  for  72  weeks.  After  blinded 
randomized  treatment,  each  subject  was  allowed  to  switch  to  open-label  TDF  treatment  which  they 
could  be  on  for 
2.5 
additional 
years.  
Figure 1.   
Subjects  were  enrolled  at  a  total  of  21  study  sites:  Poland  (8),  Romania  (3),  the  United  States  (3), 
Bulgaria (2), France (2), Spain (2), and Turkey (1). 
Randomization was stratified by age (12 to 14 and 15 to 17 years) and geographical location of study 
site (North America, Europe).  
Use of Placebo (PLB) 
GS-US-174-0115 is a randomized placebo-controlled study. A placebo comparator was used for the 
following main reasons: 
• No agent is currently registered for the treatment of adolescents in both the EU and US. 
• Use of the placebo comparator allowed a more robust evaluation of TDF safety and tolerability (eg, 
bone metabolism, renal safety), and did not expose subjects randomized to the placebo group to the 
risk of resistance development during the blinded portion of the study. Specifically, the placebo 
comparator allows quantification of adverse events (AEs) that are the result of the natural history of 
the disease, thus controlling for AEs that are unrelated to therapy. 
• For the efficacy endpoints, a randomized placebo-controlled design allows measurement of the 
absolute effect of therapy, rather than the relative effect of therapy, as when using an active 
comparator treatment.

Study Participants  
Adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years old with chronic hepatitis B infection: 
•  HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive for 
at least 6 months) 
•  weighing ≥ 35 kg 
•  with HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/mL and  
• 
• 
either ALT ≥ 2 × ULN at screening OR any history of ALT ≥ 2 × ULN over the past ≤ 24 months, 
and 
creatinine clearance ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Subjects  must  have  been  naive  to  TDF,  but  could  have  received  interferon  or  any  other  non-TDF 
containing oral anti-HBV nucleosides/nucleotide therapy. Subjects in Poland must have had a history of 
prior HBV treatment (previously treated with interferon or other drug intended to treat this indication) 
or a contraindication for treatment of HBV with existing drugs for this indication.  
Subjects  previously  treated  on  oral  anti-HBV  nucleoside/nucleotide  therapy  must  have  discontinued 
therapy ≥ 16 weeks prior to screening. Subjects must have discontinued interferon ≥ 6 months prior 
to screening.  
Subjects  must  have  been  without  serological  evidence  of  co-infection  with  human  immunodeficiency 
virus  (HIV),  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  or  hepatitis  D  virus  (HDV),  with  a  history  of  significant  bone 
disease,  decompensated  liver  disease,  evidence  of  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (ie,  α-fetoprotein  >  50 
ng/mL), and pregnant or breast-feeding females were not eligible for the study. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 1 of the following treatments in a blinded fashion: 
Treatment A: blinded TDF 300 mg PO once daily, which could be taken without regard to food. 
Treatment B: blinded matching placebo PO once daily 
Subjects  were  required  to  take  a  daily  multivitamin  containing  100%  of  the  recommended  daily 
allowance (RDA) for vitamin D (provided by the study). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was as follows: 
• 
To compare the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 
mg once daily versus placebo once daily in adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) with chronic hepatitis 
B infection. 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
To  evaluate  the  biochemical  and  serological  responses  to  TDF  versus  placebo  in  adolescents  with 
chronic hepatitis B infection. 
To evaluate the incidence of drug resistance mutations.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL 
at Week 72.  
For Weeks 48 and 72, the following secondary endpoints were evaluated (Week 48 endpoints were not 
analyzed prior to the primary efficacy analysis) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For all subjects, secondary endpoints included ALT normal; composite endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 
copies/mL and ALT normal; HBV DNA < 169 copies/mL; HBsAg loss and seroconversion. 
For  HBeAg-positive  subjects,  secondary  endpoints  included  HBeAg  loss  and  seroconversion; 
composite  endpoint  of  HBV  DNA  <  400  copies/mL,  ALT  normal  and  HBeAg  loss;  and  composite 
endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL, ALT normal, and HBeAg seroconversion. 
For  subjects  with  abnormal  ALT  at  baseline,  secondary  endpoints  included  ALT  normalized;  and 
composite endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL and ALT normalized. 
For  HBeAg-positive  subjects  with  abnormal  ALT  at  baseline,  secondary  endpoints  included 
composite endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL, ALT normalized and HBeAg loss; and composite 
endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL, ALT normalized, and HBeAg seroconversion. 
Resistance surveillance was conducted at Baseline for all subjects. Genotypic changes from baseline 
within the HBV polymerase were analyzed for subjects with HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at Weeks 48 
and/or 72, subjects who experienced virologic breakthrough (confirmed [defined as two consecutive] 
value ≥ 400 copies mL after a value < 400 copies/mL or confirmed 1.0-log10 or greater [at least 
tenfold] increases in HBV DNA from nadir), or subjects who discontinued early (after Week 24 with 
HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL). 
Pharmacokinetics: Plasma samples from all subjects collected at each study visit were utilized for 
TDF pharmacokinetic analysis and assessment of adherence to therapy (see PK section). 
Safety: The primary safety endpoint was cumulative incidence of at least a 6% decrease from baseline 
in bone mineral density of the spine through Week 72. Cumulative incidence of at least a 6% decrease 
from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of whole body through Week 72 was a secondary 
endpoint. Both of these proportions through Week 48 were also secondary safety endpoints, as were 
corresponding changes in Z-scores. Other safety endpoints included percent change from baseline in 
lumbar spine BMD; percent change from baseline in bone mineral density of whole body; and 
development of drug resistance mutations.  
Sample size 
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint (HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 72), sample sizes of 
50 subjects in each of the 2 treatment groups would provide at least 80% power to detect a difference 
of 30% between the groups, based on a 2-sided Fisher exact test with a significance level of 0.05. This 
calculation assumed a response rate of 21% in the PLB group. Note that this was an intentionally 
conservative approach, resulting in an implicit assumed response rate of 51% in the TDF group, thus 
spanning 50% with the 2 assumed proportions and thereby maximizing the sample size given the 
assumed difference of 30% between the groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 12/56 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
Approximately 100 TDF-naive subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive blinded TDF 300 mg 
PO once daily (50 subjects), or blinded matching placebo PO once daily (50 subjects). Randomization 
was stratified by age (12  to 14 years, 15 to 17  years) and geographical location of study site (North 
America, Europe). A centralized randomization procedure was used, whereby numbered bottles of TDF 
or placebo were assigned to subjects via an interactive voice response system (IVRS) according to the 
randomization code. For the first 72 weeks of the study (blinded phase), study drugs were dispensed 
to the subject in a blinded fashion in numbered bottles from supplies stored at the study site. 
Randomization could not occur until after the Baseline (pre-treatment) DEXA scan had been performed. 
Blinding (masking) 
During the blinded portion of the study, HBV DNA results were not distributed to investigators, 
subjects, or clinical research personnel involved in the clinical conduct of the study. The only exception 
was if a subject had Grade 4 ALT maintained for 16 weeks or an ALT flare, in which case serial HBV 
DNA values from Screen through the time of the event would have been made available to the 
investigator. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses of efficacy  
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted at the end of DB treatment, after the last randomized 
subject reached Week 72, using the FAS. The analysis evaluated the difference between treatment 
groups in the proportion of subjects achieving the primary endpoint, using a Mantel-Haenszel test, 
controlling for randomization age group (12 to 14 years, 15 to 17 years), with a DBEE algorithm.  
All subjects who were randomized into the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug (ie, TDF 
300 mg or matching PLB) were included in the FAS used for analysis of primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints. Of note, in the study protocol, this analysis set was referred to as the randomized and 
treated (RAT) analysis set. 
Subjects discontinuing randomized therapy prior to Week 72 were handled using a DB efficacy 
evaluation (DBEE) algorithm for the purpose of the primary efficacy analysis and all analyses of 
categorical secondary efficacy endpoints. Subjects with missing responses were treated as failures in 
this intent-to-treat algorithm. The DBEE algorithm used all available data for the DB period, and 
excluded any data for the OL period. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine 
assumptions made in the algorithm regarding data-missing-completely-at-random at Week 72. None of 
the covariates tested were statistically significant, suggesting that any data missing at Week 72 were 
missing completely-at-random. 
Subgroup analyses of efficacy endpoints included analyses for age (12 to 14 years vs. 15 to < 18 
years), for HBeAg-positive vs. HBeAg-negative subjects at study baseline, for subjects with abnormal 
vs. normal ALT at study baseline (not applicable for ALT normalization), and for subjects with vs. 
without prior oral anti-HBV treatment. 
Analysis sets 
Data were evaluated using the following analysis sets: 
All Randomized: The randomized analysis set included all subjects who were randomized into the 
study, regardless of whether they received study drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 13/56 
 
 
 
 
Full Analysis Set: The FAS included all subjects who were randomized into the study and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug (ie, TDF 300 mg or matching PLB). Of note, in the protocol, this analysis set 
was referred to as the randomized and treated (RAT) analysis set. The FAS was the primary analysis 
set for all efficacy analyses in the Week 72 end of DB treatment analysis.  
Subjects discontinuing randomized therapy prior to Week 72 were handled using a double-blind 
efficacy evaluation (DBEE) algorithm (all FAS subjects included), for the purpose of the primary 
efficacy analysis and all analyses of categorical secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Safety Analysis Set: The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of DB 
study medication. The safety analysis set was the primary analysis set for all safety analyses in the 
Week 72 end of DB treatment analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics analysis set: The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis set included all subjects who were 
treated with TDF (during DB or OL period) and had evaluable concentrations at the time points of 
interest.  
Open-Label analysis set: The OL analysis set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of OL 
TDF. This analysis set will be subdivided based on DB drug, as OL TDF (DB TDF) or OL TDF (DB PLB). 
This is the primary analysis set to be used for tabular summaries in the analyses at Weeks 144 and 
192. 
Strata and Covariates: Subjects were randomized according to stratified age (12 to 14 or 15 to 17 
years) and geographical location of study site (North America, Europe). Results

A total of 106 of the 149 subjects screened (71%) were randomized and treated. A total of 101 
subjects (51 in the TDF group and 50 in the PLB group; 95.3%) completed the double-blind period 
through Week 72. A total of 103 subjects (51 in the TDF group and 52 in the PLB group; 97.2%) 
entered the open-label period of the study. 
One subject in the TDF group did not complete the double-blind period at the investigator’s discretion. 
Of the 4 subjects in the PLB group who did not complete the double-blind period, 2 entered the open-
label period due to elevated ALT (per protocol) and 2 entered treatment-free follow-up after Week 72 
without entering open-label period of the study, with the reason recorded as investigator’s discretion. 
Recruitment 
The first subject was screened on 3 December 2008. The last subject observed for this report was on 
the 1 March 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
The  original  study  protocol  was  amended  4 times; the  first  amendment  occurred  prior  to  the  start  of 
the study. Second amendment was implemented during the double-blind treatment phase and applied 
only to investigative sites within Poland. Upon request of Poland authorities, all subjects enrolled in this 
study in Poland must have had a history of prior HBV treatment (previously treated with interferon or 
other  drug  intended  to  treat  this  indication)  or  a  contraindication  for  treatment  of  HBV  with  existing 
drugs for this indication. 
During  the  double-blind  treatment  phase  a  third  change  to  the  protocol  was  done:  The  primary 
endpoint was changed from a composite of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL and ALT normal at Week 72 to 
the single endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL. The protocol permitted entry based upon historical 
ALT in the event that ALT was not > 2 x the upper limit of normal at screening. Thus, some subjects 
may have been enrolled who had intermittent ALT elevations but a normal ALT at the time of baseline 
such that the composite endpoint would not be fully evaluable. Additionally, the inclusion criteria were 
modified  to  permit  up  to  50%  of  subjects  enrolled  to  be  HBeAg-negative  considering  that  initial 
screening indicated that approximately 50% of potential subjects have HBeAg-negative disease. 
The fourth amendment applied only to investigative sites within Poland, and made the same changes 
to the protocol described above. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Overall, demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the TDF and PLB treatment 
groups and were also generally similar in the 2 age categories (12 to 14 years and 15 to 17 years) 
within each treatment group. Subjects were predominantly white (92.5%), male (68.9%) and between 
the ages of 15 and 17 years (78.3%) (mean age of 15 years overall). The majority of subjects (95.3%) 
were enrolled at sites in Europe, and had HBV genotype A (65.1%) or D (31.1%). Baseline height, 
weight, and BMI were similar between treatment groups. 
Baseline disease characteristics 
Most of the subjects were positive for both HBeAg and HBsAg at baseline (90.6% and 100%, 
respectively). The mean number of years HBV positive was 10.5 years. Ninety of 106 subjects (84.9%) 
had prior exposure to at least 1 anti-HBV medication. Of these, 44/106 (41.5%) had previously been 
treated with interferon and lamivudine, either concurrently or serially, and 25/106 (23.6%) had

previously been treated with interferon alone. Baseline viral load was similar between treatment 
groups and age categories within the treatment groups; mean baseline HBV DNA was 8.01 log10 
copies/mL (SD 1.418) in the TDF group and 8.24 log10 copies/mL (SD 1.393) in the PLB group (Table 
5). Ten subjects (9.4%) overall had seroconverted to anti-HBe at baseline. Baseline ALT was 
abnormally high in the majority of subjects (72.6%); consistent with the inclusion criteria. The mean 
baseline ALT was 101 U/L in both treatment groups, indicating that this was a largely immune-active 
population.  
Table 6.  GS-US-174-0115: Study Baseline Disease Characteristics (Safety Analysis Set) 
Bone markers 
Bone biomarkers were similar between treatment groups, as was whole-body and spine BMD. Overall 
mean baseline whole-body BMD was 1.08 g/cm2 (SD 0.105), and spine BMD was 1.00 g/cm2 (SD 
0.160). Mean baseline vitamin D levels were 19.9 ng/mL (SD 7.59), above the lower limit of normal for 
adolescents (25[OH]D levels ≤ 15 ng/mL or 37.5 nmol/L).

Adherence to the Study Drug Regimen 
Overall subject adherence to the study drug regimen, as determined by pill counts, was high and 
similar in both treatment groups (98.7% [SD 2.06] in the TDF group and 97.9% [SD 3.80] in the PLB 
group) and across all age groups within and across treatment groups.  
Table 7.  Exposure and Adherence to Double-Blind Study Drug Safety Analysis set. 
Prior HBV medication 
Ninety of 106 subjects (84.9%) had prior exposure to at least 1 anti-HBV medication. Of these, 44/106 
(41.5%) had previously been treated with interferon and LAM, either concurrently or serially, and 
25/106 (23.6%) had previously been treated with interferon alone. 
Numbers analysed 
All 3 analysis sets comprised the same number and percentage of subjects within each treatment/age 
group and overall. The primary efficacy analysis was conducted at the end of DB treatment, after the 
last randomized subject reached Week 72, using the FAS. The FAS included all subjects who were 
randomized into the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug (ie, TDF 300 mg or matching 
PLB).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 
copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at the end of DB treatment (Week 72).  
Of equal interest is the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA below the lower limits of quantitation 
(LLoQ) of the assay, 169 copies/mL (29 IU/mL), at Week 72. 
Table 9.  GS-US-174-0125: Number and percentage of subjects with HBV DNA below 400 copies/ml 
and below 169 copies/ml at week 72 (end of DB treatment) (Full analysis set) 
At Week 72,  the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) (end of DB period) 
in the TDF group was 88.5% (46/52) vs 0 % (0/54) subject in the placebo group (1 subject with HBV 
DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 16 only).

The proportion of subjects with HBV DNA below the lower limits of quantitation (LLoQ) of the assay, 
169 copies/mL (29 IU/mL), at Week 72 in the TDF group was 84.6%.  
In the placebo group, 1 subject had HBV DNA below 400 copies/mL or below 169 copies/mL at Week 
16 only.  
HBV DNA Change Over Time Through Week 72: 
Mean changes were greater in the TDF group through Week 48 and held steady thereafter. At Week 
72, mean change from baseline in HBV DNA was −5.36 SD 1.952) log10 copies/mL in the TDF group 
versus −0.92 (SD 1.944) log10 copies/mL in the PLB group. Given that measurements below the LLoQ 
were set to a value of 168 copies/ml, the maximum log decline that it was possible to detect was 
bounded by this value (eg log[168]=2.2=lowest possible HBV log DNA level). 
Secondary Efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated in this study through Week 72 included the percentage of 
subjects with normal and normalized ALT at each visit, serological status (HBeAg/anti-HBe and 
HBsAg/anti-HBs), and composite endpoints of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL and < 169 copies/mL with 
normal ALT, with HBsAg loss, and with seroconversion. 
Normal and Normalized ALT Through Week 72 
The percentage of subjects with normal ALT at week 72 increased from 32.7% at baseline to 76.9% at 
Week 72 (DBEE analysis). When missing values were excluded, results were similar. Results were also 
similar between the two age ranges within the TDF group. In the PLB group among subjects aged 12 to 
14 years, there was no change in the percentage of subjects with normal ALT through Week 72 
(30.8% at both baseline and Week 72, DBEE and M=E analyses). In the PLB group among subjects 
aged 15 to 17 years, however, the percentage of subjects with normal ALT increased from 19.5% at 
baseline to 41.5% at Week 72 (DBEE analysis). 
The percentage of subjects with baseline ALT above the ULN who achieved ALT within the normal 
range by Week 72 was significantly larger in the TDF group (74.3%) versus the PLB group (31.0%) (p 
< 0.001, DBEE analysis) and was consistent across age groups. After Week 8, the difference between 
the TDF and PLB groups in the percentage of subjects with normal and normalized ALT was statistically 
significant (p ≤ 0.002, DBEE and M=E analyses).

HBeAg Loss and Seroconversion to anti-HBe by Week 72 
Only 1 subject (in the TDF group) experienced confirmed HBeAg loss and seroconversion.  
Table 11.   
HBsAg Loss and Seroconversion to anti-HBs by Week 72 
Two subjects (both in the TDF group) experienced HBsAg loss (DBEE analysis). One of the 2 subjects 
who experienced HBsAg loss also had seroconversion to anti-HBs at Weeks 64 and 72. The other 
subject had unconfirmed HBsAg loss at Week 32, with no seroconversion. However, this subject was 
HBsAg-positive at subsequent visits though Week 72. 
Composite endpoints 
Percentage of Subjects with HBV DNA below 400 Copies/mL and Normal ALT 
A total of 71.2% of subjects in the TDF group had HBV DNA below 400 copies/mL and ALT within the 
normal range at Week 72 (versus 0 subjects in the PLB group; p < 0.001; DBEE analysis). When 
subjects with missing values were excluded, results were similar (72.5% in the TDF group and 0 
subjects in the PLB group). Percentages were higher in subjects treated with TDF who were between 
the ages of 12 and 14 years (80.0%) compared to those between the ages of 15 and 17 years (69.0%) 
in the DBEE analysis. When subjects with missing values were excluded, results were similar. 
Percentage of Subjects with HBV DNA below 400 Copies/mL and Normalized ALT 
A total of 74.35 (26/35) of subjects that had baseline ALT above the ULN in the TDF group had HBV 
DNA below 400 copies/mL and ALT within the normal range at Week 72 (versus 0 subjects in the PLB 
group; p < 0.001; DBEE analysis). 
Percentage of Subjects with HBV DNA Below 400 copies/mL, Normal ALT, and HBeAg Loss or 
Seroconversion 
At Week 72, 7/48 (14.6%) subjects in the TDF group had achieved the composite endpoint with HBeAg 
loss, while no subjects in the PLB group had done so (DBEE analysis). The same was true for the  
composite endpoint with HBeAg seroconversion; at Week 72, 7/48 (14.6%) subjects in the TDF group 
had achieved this composite endpoint, while no subjects in the PLB group had done so (DBEE 
analysis).

Seroconversion 
At Week 72, 7/33 (21.2%) subjects in the TDF group had achieved the composite endpoint with HBeAg 
loss, while no subjects in the PLB group had done so (DBEE analysis). The same was true for the  
composite endpoint with HBeAg seroconversion; at Week 72, 7/33(21.2%) subjects in the TDF group 
had achieved this composite endpoint, while no subjects in the PLB group had done so (DBEE 
analysis). 
Composite Endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL + HBeAg loss in HBeAg-Positive Subjects 
An ad-hoc analysis for the composite endpoint of HBV DNA < 400 copies/ mL + HBeAg loss in HBeAg-
positive subjects showed a statistically significant difference between the number of subjects achieving 
the endpoint in the TDF versus PLB treatment groups at Week 72.  
Ten of 48 subjects (20.8%) in the TDF group and 0 subjects in the PLB group had HBV DNA < 400 
copies/mL and HBeAg loss at Week 72 (p = 0.001) (DBEE analysis).

Analyses based on the immune status 
The CHMP raised doubts on the population included in this study since, neither liver biopsies were 
performed nor historical data were provided in adolescents in this study to better evaluate this issue. 
The MAH has addressed this concern and provided further analyses as described below.  
The protocol required subjects to have alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2 times the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) at the time of screening or at any time over the previous ≤ 24 months. Thus, all subjects 
were required to have evidence of elevated ALT, but some were included with normal baseline values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 22/56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 29/106 (27.4%) subjects had ALT values within the normal range (32.7% TDF and 22.2% 
PLB) at baseline. 
An ad hoc analysis based on ALT level at baseline was conducted in which two subpopulations were 
identified – an IA subgroup (baseline ALT > 1.5 × ULN), and an IT subgroup (baseline ALT ≤ 1.5 × 
ULN). In the TDF subgroups (both IA and IT), high viral suppression was demonstrated at Week 72 in 
comparison to PLB in both subgroups and higher in the IA subgroup (96.4% TDF IA vs 0% in PLB IA, 
and 79.2% TDF IT vs 0% in PLB IT group, p < 0.001). 
IA subjects treated with TDF had a significantly greater biochemical (75% with normal ALT) response 
in comparison to PLB at Week 72. In the IT subgroups, there was a suggestion of a treatment effect on 
ALT levels. 
The effect of TDF on HBeAg loss and seroconversion was evaluated in these subgroups. At Week 72, 
10/48 (20.8%) subjects treated with TDF experienced HBeAg loss compared with 7/48 (14.6%) PLB 
subjects (p = 0.41; double-blind efficacy evaluation [DBEE] analysis). When evaluated by IA status, 
differences were observed between TDF and PLB. In the TDF IA subgroup, 8/26 (30.8%) subjects 
experienced HBeAg loss at Week 72 compared with 4/32 (12.5%) subjects in the PLB IA subgroup (p = 
0.11). In contrast, in the IT subgroups, 2/22 (9.1%) subjects in the TDF IT subgroup and 3/16 
(18.8%) subjects in the PLB IT subgroup experienced HBeAg loss at Week 72 (p = 0.63). Identical 
results were observed when the IA and IT subgroups were evaluated for HBeAg seroconversion to anti-
HBe. 
Furthermore, in the TDF groups, the stringent composite endpoint of HBV DNA<400 copies/ml, Normal 
ALT and HBeAg loss was achieved in 23% (n=6) of patients with immune active disease versus 4.5% 
(n=1) in immune-tolerant patients, which further highlights that the IA population is the population 
that can most benefit from treatment. 
Other Analyses Related to Efficacy 
Genotypic Analysis at Baseline within the HBV Polymerase 
Genotypes A and D were the most commonly observed genotypes in each treatment group (65% and 
31% respectively). Overall, 3 subjects were identified with genotype B virus (3%), and 1 subject had 
genotype C virus (1%). The distribution of genotypes was similar across both treatment groups.  
Sequence analysis of HBV pol/RT for all baseline samples revealed that 10 subjects, 7 in the TDF group 
and 3 in the PLB group, had conserved site changes at baseline. The majority of the conserved site 
changes observed at baseline (6/7 subjects in the TDF group and 2/3 subjects in the PLB group) were 
lamivudine (LAM) resistance-associated mutations (rtL180M ± rtM204V/I). 
Genotypic Change from Baseline within the HBV Polymerase at week 72 
In the TDF group, 5 subjects qualified for resistance surveillance at Week 72. One Subject qualified for 
genotypic analysis at Week 72 because the subject had HBV DNA > 400 copies/mL in the absence of 
virologic breakthrough. Despite the subject’s HBV DNA never having been < 400 copies/mL by Week 
72, this subject experienced a 6.86-log10 decline in HBV DNA from baseline. Genotypic analysis of the 
Week 72 sample revealed no sequence changes compared to baseline, identical to what was observed 
at Week 48. 
One subject qualified for genotypic analysis due to unconfirmed virologic breakthrough. This subject 
had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL by Week 8, which was maintained until Week 72 when the subject’s 
HBV DNA increased to 5.72 log10 copies per mL. This increase in HBV DNA was associated with study 
drug nonadherence, as determined by tenofovir plasma levels below the limit of quantitation at Week 
72. The increase in HBV DNA was transient, as HBV DNA returned to < 400 copies/ mL at the following 
visit. Genotypic analysis revealed unique polymorphic site changes compared to baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 23/56 
 
 
 
 
The remaining 3 subjects qualified for resistance surveillance at Week 72 due to having confirmed 
virologic breakthrough. From these, one subject had confirmed virologic breakthrough at Week 40 
which was maintained through Week 64. This subject experienced another episode of confirmed 
virologic breakthrough at Week 72, with a 5.37-log10 increase in HBV DNA from nadir at Week 32. 
Virologic breakthrough could be attributed to study drug nonadherence, as determined by tenofovir 
plasma levels below the limit of quantitation at Week 72. Identical to what was observed at Week 48, 
genotypic analysis at Week 72 revealed a reversion back to wild-type at a conserved site (rtR/W3W) 
along with maintenance of LAM resistance-associated mutations detected at baseline (rtL180L/M, 
rtM204M/V). Another subject had HBV DNA below 400 copies/mL from Week 24 through Week 56 and 
then had confirmed virologic breakthrough at Week 64 with low-level viremia of 3.79 log10 copies/mL. 
Virologic breakthrough could be attributed to study drug nonadherence, as determined by tenofovir 
plasma levels below the limit of quantification at Weeks 64 and 72. Genotypic analysis of the Week 72 
sample demonstrated one unique polymorphic site change compared to baseline. One subject had HBV 
DNA below 400 copies/mL from Week 32 to Week 56 and then had confirmed virologic breakthrough at 
Week 64 with HBV DNA values increasing to over 8 log10. Virologic breakthrough could be attributed 
to study drug nonadherence, as indicated by low tenofovir plasma levels below the limit of 
quantification at Weeks 64 and 72. Genotypic analysis of the Week 72 sample showed no changes from 
baseline. Of the 4 subjects who had virologic breakthrough at Week 72, all had plasma tenofovir levels 
below the limit of quantitation indicating that breakthrough was due to non-adherence to study drug. 
Comparison with adults data 
The rates of response in this study through Week 48 were generally consistent with that of adult 
subjects during the first 48 weeks of the double-blind TDF treatment in two Phase 3 clinical studies of 
TDF in chronic HBV (GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103):

1.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support the extension of the indication for Viread in adolescents chronically infected with HBV, the 
MAH submitted the 72 weeks results of the ongoing pivotal study, GS-US-174-0115. This study is a 
Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the Safety and Efficacy of Tenofovir DF 
in Adolescents with CHB infection. Long term data Studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 in 
adults could also be considered as support of efficacy and safety.  
The study was initiated in December 2008 and was primarily conducted in Europe (mostly in Poland) 
and US. The study design (72 weeks comparison between TDF and placebo) allows from an efficacy

point of view to compare with spontaneous seroconversion rates and from a safety point of view to 
evaluate the effect on bone mineral density.  
No liver biopsy was performed before inclusion in the study and ALT criterion for inclusion in the study 
was not stringent, allowing inclusion of patients with ALT ≥ 2 × ULN at screening (not confirmed) or 
any history of ALT ≥ 2 × ULN over the past ≤ 24 months.  
The study population consists mainly of adolescents with HBeAg-positive disease (90%) and with prior 
exposure to lamivudine and/or interferon (only 15% were naïve to any HBV treatment). This is 
considered acceptable because in adults, the efficacy has been validated in both HBe Ag + and -. The 
same consideration applies for treatment naïve and pretreated patients. The efficacy of tenofovir in 
adults is established in both populations.  
Study GS-US-174-0115 showed superiority of TDF over placebo on the primary endpoint (proportion of 
patients with HBV DNA <400 copies/ml), when the most conservative analysis was considered 
(missing=failures). Superiority was also demonstrated for the more stringent criterion of proportion of 
patients with HBV DNA <169 copies/ml (88.5% vs 0%, p<0.001). Response rate were comparable in 
the 12-14 (n= 23) and 15-17 (n= 83) years age groups. Patients with abnormal ALT at baseline had 
notably greater rate of response as compared to patients who had normal ALT at baseline. 
TDF showed greater potency over placebo not only on the primary endpoint but also on all secondary 
endpoints.  
However, the viral response is not translated into a major differential in terms of HBeAg 
seroconversion rate. The difference in favour of TDF (21% vs 15%), was not statistically significant. 
Moreover, the 21% rate of HBeAg seroconversion in the TDF arm illustrates the need for a life long 
treatment for the vast majority of adolescents. These results raised several questions: 1) the benefit of 
introducing Viread with its bone toxicity in a population still in bone modelling process, as compared to 
introducing the drug in the adulthood 2) The need to delineate a population for which an immediate 
need could justify outweighing the bone risk (these issues are further discussed at the safety and 
benefit risk sections). 
The MAH has addressed these concerns and provided further analyses. An ad hoc analysis based on 
ALT level at baseline was conducted. In the TDF subgroups (both IA and IT), viral suppression was 
demonstrated at Week 72 in comparison to PLB (96.4% TDF IA vs 0% in PLB IA, and 79.2% TDF IT vs 
0% in PLB IT group, p < 0.001). IA subjects treated with TDF had a significantly greater biochemical 
(75% with normal ALT) response in comparison to PLB at Week 72. In the IT subgroups, there was a 
suggestion of a treatment effect on ALT levels. In the TDF IA subgroup, 8/26 (30.8%) subjects 
experienced HBeAg loss at Week 72 compared with 4/32 (12.5%) subjects in the PLB IA subgroup (p = 
0.11). In contrast, in the IT subgroups, 2/22 (9.1%) subjects in the TDF IT subgroup and 3/16 
(18.8%) subjects in the PLB IT subgroup experienced HBeAg loss at Week 72 (p = 0.63). In the TDF 
groups, the stringent composite endpoint of HBV DNA<400 copies/ml, Normal ALT and HBeAg loss was 
achieved in 23% (n=6) of patients with immune active disease versus 4.5% (n=1) in immune-tolerant 
patients, which further highlights that the IA population is the population that can most benefit from 
treatment. Overall, these results reinforce the use in patients in active status of the disease. 
No patients had TDF resistance-associated mutation through week 72 in this study. TDF showed a high 
genetic barrier in children as it was observed for adults. 
Overall, TDF appears as effective in adolescents as in adults. The study is ongoing with an open-label 
phase for up to a total of 4 years that will help to document longer-term efficacy and resistance of TDF 
in adolescents.

1.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 106 subjects (52 in the TDF group and 54 in the placebo group) were randomized and 
treated. A total of 101 subjects (51 in the TDF group and 50 in the placebo group) completed the 
double-blind period through Week 72. 
A total of 103 subjects (51 in the TDF group and 52 in the placebo group) entered the Open-Label 
period of the study. One subject in the TDF group did not complete the double-blind period at the 
investigator’s discretion. Of the 4 subjects in the PLB group who did not complete the DB period, 2 
entered the Open-Label period due to elevated ALT (per protocol) and 2 entered treatment free follow-
up after Week 72 without entering Open-Label period of the study, with the reason recorded as 
investigator’s discretion. 
All subjects completed at least 24 weeks of treatment. The mean duration of treatment was 497.3 
days in the TDF group vs 489.7 days in the placebo group. The percentage of subjects with 72 weeks 
of study drug exposure was > 92% in both groups. 
Subjects were predominantly white (92.5%), male (68.9%) and between the ages of 15 and < 18 
years (78.3%) (mean age of 15 years overall). 
In summary the safety of TDF has been studied in 52 subjects aged from 12 to 18 years old (10 
subjects in group age 12-14 years and 42 subjects in group 15-<18). The mean duration of treatment 
was 497.3 days in the TDF group. 
Adverse events 
An overview of treatment emergent adverse events in study GS-US-174-0115 is provided in the table 
15 below.

Page 29/56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 16.  GS-US-174-0115: Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
A similar proportion of subjects in the TDF group (84.6 %) and in the placebo group (88.9%) 
experienced a treatment emergent AEs. However when comparing by group age a higher proportion of 
subjects aged 12-14 years old experienced treatment emergent AEs in the TDF group compared to the 
placebo group (90% vs 61.5%). However the small number of subjects in the age group 12 to 14 
years should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. In the group age 15-<18 years 
a lower proportion of subjects experienced treatment emergent AEs in the TDF group (83.3%) 
compared to the placebo group (97.6%).  
The number of patients who experienced treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the TDF group 
(11.5%) vs placebo group (22.2%).  
A similar proportion of subjects in the TDF group (15.4%) and in the placebo group (16.7%) 
experienced an AE that was considered study drug related. 
Primary safety endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint was cumulative incidence of at least a 6% decrease from study baseline in 
lumbar spine BMD through Week 72. No subjects met the primary safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in

lumbar spine BMD. As expected for an adolescent population, both treatment groups experienced an 
overall increase in mean lumbar spine BMD. However, the percent increase from baseline in lumbar 
spine BMD in subjects who received TDF was less than the percent increase in spine BMD attained by 
subjects who received placebo at Week 24 (1.87% vs 3.42%), at Week 48 (3.50% vs 5.58%), and at 
Week 72 (4.95% vs 8.14%). Five subjects (3 in the TDF group and 2 in the placebo group) had a 
decrease of > 4% in spine BMD. None of these subjects were reported as having had associated bone 
events, including fracture.

(g/cm2) by Study Baseline in Spine Bone Mineral Density (g/cm2) by Study Week: Categorical 
Summaries on Number of Subjects (Safety Analysis Set2). 
Regarding the whole body BMD, in the TDF 15-17 years group, 24% patients experienced a decrease 
of BMD (≤0%) compared to 11% in the placebo group. 
However, no patient in the TDF group (vs 2.8% subject in the placebo group) had a decrease of > 4% 
in spine BMD. 
No decreased is observed in the 12-14 years groups. However, at week 72 only 6 patients in the TDF 
group had a BMD measure. 
Common adverse events 
In both treatment group, the highest proportion of subjects reported AEs in the following SOCs: 
Infections and Infestations (TDF: 59.6% vs placebo: 63.0%), Investigations (TDF: 25.0% vs placebo: 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012

31.5%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (TDF: 21.2% vs placebo: 31.5%), and Respiratory, Thoracic, and 
Mediastinal Disorders (TDF: 23.1% vs placebo: 20.4%). 
The most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs in the TDF group were the following: 
Pharyngitis (15 subjects), Nasopharyngitis (5 subjects), Upper respiratory tract infection (5 subjects), 
Rhinitis (5 subjects). And the most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs in the placebo group 
were: Nasopharyngitis (12 subjects), Alanine aminotransferase increased (12 subjects), Pharyngitis 
(11 subjects), Acne (10 subjects), Headache (8 subjects). 
Treatment emergent AEs occurring with ≥ 5 % incidence and reported for higher proportion of subjects 
in the TDF group compared to placebo group were the following: Pharyngitis (28.8% vs 20.4%), 
Rhinitis (9.6% vs 5.6%), Blood creatine phosphokinase increased (7.7% vs 3.7%), Cough (5.8% vs 
5.6%), Diarrhoea (7.7% vs 1.9%), Epistaxis (5.8% vs 3.7%), Pyrexia (5.8% vs 1.9%) and Nail 
disorder (5.8% vs 0%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 5 subjects (9.6%) in the TDF group and 13 
subjects (24.1%) in the placebo group.  
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent AEs were increased ALT (5 subjects in 
the placebo group) and hepatitis (2 subjects in the TDF group and 6 subjects in the placebo group). 
A higher proportion of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent AEs in the placebo group 
(24.1% vs 9.6%) is explained by the fact that more patients receiving placebo experienced severe  
hepatic events. Reported grade 3 or 4 AEs in TDF group consisted in Tooth Disorder (n=1), Gingivitis 
(n=1), Hepatitis (n=2), Hand Fracture (n=1), Muscle Spasms (n=1) and syncope (n=1). 
No death was reported during the randomized treatment period. 
Renal Adverse Events 
No renal adverse events have been reported in the TDF group. 
Hepatic Adverse Events 
Thirteen subjects had “Hepatobiliary Disorders” SOC events (3 subjects in the TDF group and 10 
subjects in the placebo group). Hepatitis was reported in 3 TDF-treated subjects and 7 placebo-treated 
subjects, hepatomegaly in 2 placebo treated subjects, and hypertransaminasemia was reported in 1 
placebo-treated subject. In addition, 30 subjects including 13 subjects in the TDF group and 17 
subjects in the placebo group had “Investigations” SOC results related to liver function reported as an 
AE. Of those, 15 subjects had increased ALT reported as an AE (3 subjects in the TDF group and 12 
subjects in the placebo group). 
Fourteen subjects had hepatic flares (including ALT increased, hepatitis, and transaminases increased) 
reported as a Grade 3 or 4 AE (2 subjects in the TDF group vs 12 subjects in the placebo group). An 
additional subject in the TDF group had Grade 2 ALT increased reported as an AE; however, this 
subject’s ALT values did not meet the Grade 3 or 4 criterion for a hepatic flare. There were no ALT 
flares reported as Grade 4 AEs in the TDF group, whereas there were 8 subjects with ALT flares 
reported as Grade 4 AEs in the placebo group.

Bone Adverse Events 
One subject receiving TDF had a hand fracture. The subject had a Grade 3 fracture of the left hand 
forefinger sustained in an altercation on Day 406 that was considered serious, but not related to study 
drug. The event resolved by Day 448. The subject remained in the study with no interruptions to study 
drug administration. 
Other potentially bone-related AEs included exostosis in 1 subject (TDF), bone pain in 2 subjects 
(placebo), and jaw pain in 1 subject (TDF).  
Laboratory findings 
A lower proportion of subjects experienced treatment-emergent Grade 3-4 laboratories abnormalities 
in the TDF group (26.9%) compared to the placebo group (50%). 
A higher proportion of subjects in the TDF group compared to the placebo group experienced grade 3 
or 4 increased serum amylase (2 subjects vs 1 subject), serum lipase (3 subjects vs 1 subject), and 
increased creatine kinase (1 subject vs 0 subject). Of note no pancreatitis considered as related to TDF 
has been reported. 
A lower proportion of subjects in the TDF group compared to the placebo group experienced grade 3 or 
4 increases in ALT (6 subjects vs 22 subjects), increases in AST (3 subjects vs 9 subjects).

Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density 
Percentage Change from Baseline in Lumbar Spine BMD 
Statistically significant differences in mean lumbar spine BMD percent change from baseline were 
observed at Week 24 and Week 48 between the placebo and TDF groups. At Week 72, subjects in the 
TDF group had a mean lumbar spine BMD increase from baseline of 4.95%, compared to 8.14% for 
subjects in the Placebo group as shown in the table 17 below.

Lumbar Spine BMD Z-Score 
To further assess any effect of treatment on lumbar spine BMD, Z-scores were calculated. A Z-score of 
0 indicates that a subject is typical of the population for their age and gender. A negative Z-score 
indicates that the subject’s recorded value is lower than typical for their age, race, and/or gender. A 
positive Z-score indicates that the subject’s recorded value is higher than typical for their age, race, 
and/or gender. A negative change in Z-score indicates that a subject is falling behind his age and 
gender matched peers. 
The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to Week 72 in the TDF group was -0.05. 
The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score in the placebo group was 0.07.

Baseline by Study Week (Safety Analysis Set). 
Whole Body Bone Mineral Density 
Percentage Change from Baseline in Whole Body BMD 
Statistically significant differences in whole body BMD percent change from baseline were observed at 
Weeks 24, 48, and 72 between the Placebo and TDF groups. At Week 72, subjects in the TDF group 
had a mean whole body BMD increase from baseline of 2.84%, compared to 5.37% for subjects in the 
placebo group.

Whole Body BMD Z-Score 
The mean change in whole body BMD Z-score from baseline to Week 72 in the TDF group was -0.15 
and in the Placebo group was 0.06. According to the MAH, these small aggregate differences were 
unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
Further analyses provided by the MAH on BMD Z-scores following RSI 
In general, a Z-score of less than or equal to -2 is considered by the ISCD to be an indication of low 
BMD. For purposes of data analyses, however, a conservative cut-off of -1.5 was used to identify the 
subjects with the lowest Z-scores to compare TDF data to placebo (PLB).

Figure 3 shows the distribution of individual subjects’ lumbar spine BMD Z-scores. 
Figure 3.  GS-US-174-0115: Distribution of Lumbar Spine BMD Z-Scores at Baseline and Weeks 24, 48, 
72 
At baseline and over 72 weeks, there was considerable overlap of lumbar spine BMD Z-scores between 
the TDF and PLB groups. Of note, at baseline the majority of subjects had lumbar spine Z-scores that 
were below zero (horizontal line) and remained so throughout the 72-week study period. At baseline, 
the mean (standard deviation [SD]) spine BMD Z-score was lower in the TDF group (-0.43 [0.764]) 
than the PLB group (-0.28 [0.813]). At Week 72, mean (SD) change from baseline in Z-scores were -
0.05 (0.310) and 0.07 (0.377) for the TDF and PLB groups, respectively. 
Figure 2 shows individual lumbar spine BMD Z-scores at baseline and Week 72. In the figure, 
dissecting lines have been included to indicate a Z-score cut of -1.5 at baseline (vertical line), and a Z-
score cut of -1.5 at Week 72 (horizontal line). These indicate individuals with lower BMD scores. A 
diagonal line of unity representing no change in BMD Z-scores has also been included.

Figure 4.  GU-US-174-0115: Week 72 vs Baseline Spine BMD Z-Scores 
Overall, the distribution of individual Z-scores is similar between TDF and PLB subjects with the 
majority of subjects having Z-scores above -1.5 at Week 72. There were a small number of subjects (2 
PLB and 3 TDF) who had Z-scores ≤ −1.5 at both baseline and Week 72, and a small number of 
subjects (2 PLB and 1 TDF) who had baseline Z-scores above -1.5 and who then shifted to a Z-score ≤ 
-1.5 at Week 72. In summary, at Week 72 there were equal numbers of subjects in each treatment 
group (4 PLB and 4 TDF) who had Z-scores ≤ −1.5. 
To illustrate the changes in the 2 groups, regression lines for both treatment groups, TDF and PLB 
(dotted lines representing 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) are provided (Figure 3). The regression 
lines for TDF and PLB are very similar, further indicating a similar trend of Z-score change from 
baseline to Week 72 in both treatment groups.

Finally, analysis on the change in Z-score at Week 72 as a function of initial (baseline) Z-score shows 
again considerable overlap observed in Z-score changes at Week 72 in TDF and PLB subjects vs 
baseline. 
It is to be noted as a particular limitation that the BMD measures were not made according to height 
and weight (see list of outstanding issues).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject was withdrawn from the study due to an AE (Grade 4 syncope that was not considered to 
be related to the study drug) in the TDF group. 
1.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To date, the safety profile of TDF in children and adolescents has been characterized in five clinical 
studies conducted in patients with HIV. Three have been completed (GS-02-983, GS-01-926, and GS-
01-927) and 2 additional studies are ongoing (Study GS-US-104-0321 and Study GS-US-104-0352). 
Regarding the same population studied (i.e. adolescents), the application in HIV infected adolescents 
was withdrawn in 2010 due to major objections from the CHMP on safety grounds (bone toxicity) and 
inadequate efficacy demonstration in GS-US-104-321 study. Study GS-US-104-0352, aimed to 
demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TDF in HIV infected children is being assessed in a 
parallel procedure. 
The main safety concerns of TDF in adult population are related to renal toxicity and bone toxicity. 
Regarding study GS-US-174-0115: 
-  No renal adverse events have been reported in the TDF group.  However, results from studies 
with tenofovir in HIV children, show that renal events, especially tubulopathies present a late 
onset (no event occurred before week 48). Thus, long term exposure data are required to better 
evaluate renal toxicity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 38/56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  No patient met the primary safety endpoint (ie decrease of at least 6% in lumbar spine BMD). 
However, a 6% decrease when an increase is expected, since bone mass is known to accumulate 
rapidly during childhood, does not seem to be an appropriate threshold. 
At week 72, 8/39 (21%) patients aged 15-18 years experienced a decrease of BMD in the TDF 
group compared to 5/36 (14%) in the placebo group, including 3/39 (7.6%) subjects in the TDF 
group (vs 2/36 (5.6%) in the placebo group) with a decrease of > 4% in spine BMD. 
The results at week 72 showed a lower increase of total mean lumbar spine BMD and total BMD 
in the TDF group compared to the placebo group. 25% of the patients in the TDF 15-18 years 
group experienced a -0.28 lumbar spine BMD Z-score and a -0.41 whole body BMD Z-score 
decrease, including 5/38 (13%) patients with respectively a -0.97, -0.81, -0.70, -0.69, -0.65.  
The above results raised concerns. In response the MAH has provided further analyses to 
address this issue. The following conclusions were derived: 
Small decreases in median BMD Z-scores have been observed following treatment with TDF. 
Equal numbers of subjects in each treatment group (4 PLB and 4 TDF) had spine BMD Z-scores ≤ 
−1.5 at Week 72 
Minimal differences between TDF or comparator groups were seen in changes from baseline in 
spine BMD Z-scores. Small decreases in total body BMD Z-score were observed for subjects who 
received TDF compared to subjects who received placebo in Study GS-US-174-0115. 
Interpretation of the long-term data available in paediatric subjects is restricted by the small 
sample size and the lack of control group beyond 72 weeks of treatment (data beyond 72 weeks 
of treatment in Study GS-US-174-0115 are not available). 
The decreases in total body BMD Z-scores observed following the initiation of TDF do not appear 
to be associated with an increased fracture rate (1 pathological fracture/103 patients treated 
with TDF). Low BMD per se is not a unique marker in identifying clinical concerns/consequences. 
The long-term clinical relevance of these observations is unknown, and no signal of BMD 
alteration justifying treatment withdrawal can be proposed. Decisions regarding (dis)continuation 
of treatment with TDF in paediatric patients should be made by the treating physician, taking 
into account the benefits and risks for the individual patient. 
In adolescent subjects with chronic HBV infection, there is insufficient evidence for reversibility or 
lack of reversibility of renal events (eg. hypophosphatemia) and reductions in BMD when TDF is 
withdrawn. 
The association of lower levels of BMI and lower levels of vitamin D at baseline by univariate 
analysis is suggestive of poor nutritional status being a potential risk factor for lower BMD. In a 
multivariate analysis, baseline spine BMD Z-score was found to be the only statistically 
significant predictor of spine BMD Z-scores ≤ -1.5 at Week 72; study treatment was not a 
statistically significant predictor. 
In view of the limited data, no specific recommendations can be made at this time regarding 
vitamin D supplementation for patients receiving TDF. 
Overall due to the lack of long-term safety data and difficulties in assessing the clinical relevance 
of BMD decrease in children, bone toxicity related to TDF remains a particular concern for 
paediatric use.

1.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile characterised by bone toxicity makes tenofovir an “a priori” non optimal candidate 
for the paediatric population. An extension of the Marketing Authorisation for Viread 
(EMEA/H/C/00419/X/105/G in the treatment of HIV infection in children aged 2 to < 12 years old is 
under parallel evaluation and major objections on renal and bone toxicity were also raised. A SAG has 
been requested by the CHMP in order to provide a position on the risk of bone and renal toxicity of 
Viread in the context of its use in both HIV and HBV infected paediatric and adult patients. PDCO 
members as experts provided input to the scientific discussion at the SAG. 
The SAG meeting was held the 3 May 2012. The discussion focused on the safety burden of tenofovir in 
the paediatric population and gave important information on the safety monitoring of the use of 
tenofovir in paediatric patients. Overall, SAG members highlighted the lack of correlation between DXA 
measurements and bone events and the difficulties to provide specific recommendation as regards 
supplementation. 
As regards renal toxicity in paediatric patients, the SAG members did not foresee any specific reason 
for the renal toxicity in adults being different in children and adolescents. Only the phosphate loss 
resulting from the tubulopathy could be of differential impact given that paediatric patients are in 
active process of bone modelling. The current recommendation of renal toxicity monitoring in adults 
are judged conservative enough and could overall be aligned for paediatric patients, especially having 
in mind that this paediatric population is expected to be closely managed in clinical practice. As regards 
the need for treatment interruption in paediatric patients, it was considered that instead of stating a 
specific threshold for withdrawal, as in adults, it would be more appropriate to give a general message 
that significant laboratory abnormality suggestive of renal toxicity during treatment should trigger 
specialised consultation. 
As regards bone toxicity, the SAG members have considered that it is currently questioned whether the 
observed toxicity of the drug could be of any long term consequence. Therefore the discussion on the 
benefit/risk could then amount balancing theoretical risks versus established benefit (virological 
suppression). When considering the need for specific monitoring, the SAG members refute the value of 
any BMD monitoring given the lack of established correlation with clinical event, all the more that it 
represents a burden for paediatric patients and raises practical and technical issues. As regards the 
need for phosphate and Vitamin D supplementation, the SAG members have considered that there was 
no apparent reason to deviate from the general attitude which prevails in clinical practice for a 
population in active modelling process (i.e. supplementation is considered in case of significant 
depletion). 
The CHMP has agreed with the SAG views. The SmPC was revised to reflect the uncertainties 
associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity.  Since, the reversibility of renal 
toxicity cannot be fully ascertained a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh 
on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment and to decide on the appropriate 
monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and to consider the need for 
supplementation.  
To address bone safety concerns the applicant proposed a BMD monitoring at baseline and during 
therapy in at risk patients.  The CHMP did not agree to impose a BMD given the lack of established 
correlation with clinical event and given the burden it represents for paediatric patients as well 
acknowledging practical and technical issues.  
The MAH was requested to perform additional studies. A separate post-authorisation safety study with 
a representative sample of HIV- and HBV infected children to help establish evidence-based strategies

for management of TDF-associated renal and bone toxicity (protocol synopsis to be submitted by 31 
December 2012) and a Drug Utilisation Study in HIV-1 and HBV-infected paediatric patients to follow-
up the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures (draft synopsis to be submitted by 25 October 
2012). In addition, the CHMP considered that the MAH should submit the following safety data: a 
cumulative review of renal tubulopathy reports in HIV-1 and HBV infected adult patients by 31 
December 2012. 
Details of these studies are detailed in the RMP. 
1.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.  The 
RMP addressed the safety concerns identified with tenofovir. 
Risk minimisation plan 
The MAH proposed an educational brochure for adolescents to address renal and bone toxicity and to 
include dosing recommendations on this population, in addition to the educational brochure for adults. 
The CHMP recognises the need of this educational material and formalised the ongoing activities in 
annex II of the product information. The key messages are reflected in Annex II. The CHMP requested 
the review of the HBV educational brochure for adolescents aged 12 to <18 years.

Current approved Viread SmPC text is as follows: 
Statements in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
Tenofovir is eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to tenofovir increases in 
patients with renal dysfunction. There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and long term safety data has not been evaluated for 
mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min). Therefore, in patients with 
renal impairment tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should only be used if the potential 
benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Dose interval 
adjustments are recommended for patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min. 
Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 ml/min): Limited data from clinical 
studies support once daily dosing of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with mild 
renal impairment. 
Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 ml/min): Administration of 245 
mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) every 48 hours is recommended based on modeling 
of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in HIV negative and non-HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease requiring 
haemodialysis, but has not been confirmed in clinical studies. Therefore, clinical 
response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients. 
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and haemodialysis patients: 
Adequate dose adjustments cannot be applied due to lack of alternative tablet strengths, 
therefore use in this group of patients is not recommended. If no alternative treatment is 
available, prolonged dose intervals may be used as follows: 
Severe renal impairment: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) may be administered 
every 72–96 hours (dosing twice a week). 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 41/56 
 
 
 
 
 
HIV-1 and HBV infected 
pediatric patients 
Haemodialysis patients: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) may be administered 
every 7 days following completion of a haemodialysis session*. 
These dose adjustments have not been confirmed in clinical studies. Simulations suggest 
that the prolonged dose interval is not optimal and could result in increased toxicity and 
possibly inadequate response. Therefore clinical response to treatment and renal 
function should be closely monitored. 
* Generally, once weekly dosing assuming three haemodialysis sessions per week, each 
of approximately 4 hours duration or after 12 hours cumulative haemodialysis. 
No dosing recommendations can be given for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine 
clearance < 10 ml/min. 
Warnings in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Co-administration of other medicinal products: Viread should not be administered 
concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Renal function: Renal safety with tenofovir has only been studied to a very limited degree 
in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). 
It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to 
initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and renal function (creatinine 
clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored every four weeks during the first year, 
and then every three months. In patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients 
who have previously experienced renal events while receiving adefovir dipivoxil, 
consideration should be given to more frequent monitoring of renal function. 
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients: There 
are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients 
with impaired renal function. Therefore, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should only be 
used if the potential benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks. 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and in 
patients who require haemodialysis use of tenofovir is not recommended. If no 
alternative treatment is available, the dosing interval must be adjusted and renal 
function should be closely monitored. 
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to 
< 50 ml/min in any patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should 
be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood 
potassium and urine glucose concentrations. Consideration should also be given to 
interrupting treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine 
clearance decreased to < 50 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl 
(0.32 mmol/l). 
Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of 
a nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, 
ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2). If concomitant use of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function 
should be monitored weekly. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving 
medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway, including the 
transport proteins human organic anion transporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. 
cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product). These renal transporter proteins may 
be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of tenofovir and 
cidofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products which are 
secreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 
4 might be modified if they are co-administered. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant 
use of these medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not 
recommended, but if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 
Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with 
proximal renal tubulopathy. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate 
consultation should be obtained. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, rare events of 
renal impairment, renal failure and proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi 
syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to 
fractures) have been reported. Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients 
receiving Viread (see section 4.4). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B:  
Renal impairment: As Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is 
recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8a). 
e. Other special population(s) 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 42/56 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can cause renal 
toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended in any patient with renal 
impairment treated with Viread (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Adverse reactions in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC: 
Renal and urinary disorders: 
Uncommon: increased creatinine 
Rare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal renal 
tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome), nephritis (including acute interstitial 
nephritis), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: 
Very common: hypophosphataemia* 
Uncommon: hypokalaemia* 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 
Uncommon: rhabdomyolysis*, muscular weakness* 
Rare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to 
fractures)*, myopathy* 
* This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is 
not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
absence of this condition. 
Update of labeling as appropriate 
Proposed additional Viread SmPC text specific to the treatment of pediatric patients is as 
follows (based on proposed updates to the Viread 245 mg SmPC): 
Statement in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in paediatric patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
Statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Renal and bone effects in paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. 
Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis 
the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment 
(including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation. 
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported 
in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-
0352 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to 
treatment and monitored during treatment as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient 
receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one 
week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose 
concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are 
suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained to 
consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). 
Renal impairment 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in paediatric patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should not be initiated 
in paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued in paediatric 
patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy. 
Statement in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1 
Of 89 patients (2 to < 12 years) who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in study GS-
US-104-0352 (median exposure 104 weeks), 4 patients discontinued from the study due 
to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
Paediatric population:  
HIV-1: 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 4 out of 89 paediatric patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate discontinued due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal 
tubulopathy (median tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure was 104 weeks).

Additional Risk Minimization Activities 
Educational initiatives (‘HIV and the Kidney’ educational program, renal educational 
program for HBV, educational brochures distributed to prescribers). 
Update of educational program as appropriate 
Following the approval of the pediatric applications, renal risk minimization activities 
will be updated to include information on HIV-1 infected children and adolescents and 
HBV infected adolescents.  Educational brochures specific to the use of Viread in these 
pediatric populations will be distributed to pediatric prescribers. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Current approved Viread SmPC text is as follows: 
Statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Bone effects: In HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that 
compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine 
and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases in bone mineral density of 
the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in bone mineral 
density of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater 
in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in bone 
mineral density of hip were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks. However, 
there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone 
abnormalities over 144 weeks.  
Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with 
proximal renal tubulopathy. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate 
consultation should be obtained. 
Paediatric population: Viread may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future 
fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1). 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, rare events of 
renal impairment, renal failure and proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi 
syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to 
fractures) have been reported. Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients 
receiving Viread (see section 4.4). 
Adverse reactions in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 
Rare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to 
fractures)1,2 
1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is 
not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
absence of this condition. 
2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not 
observed in randomized controlled clinical trials or the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
expanded access program. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical 
calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate in randomized clinical trials and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
Paediatric population:  
HIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment experienced patients 12 
to < 18 years of age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 45) or placebo 
(n = 42) in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score 
was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of 
double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 
and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and placebo 
groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate group compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and one adolescent in the placebo group had 
significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 28 patients receiving 
96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, BMD Z-scores declined 
by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. 
Update of labeling as appropriate 
Proposed additional Viread SmPC text specific to the treatment of pediatric patients is as 
follows:

There are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. 
Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis 
the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment 
(including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation. 
Bone effects: 
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with 
an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. 
Statement in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 
infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on their 
stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Chronic hepatitis B 
Reductions in BMD have been observed in HBV-infected adolescents.  The BMD Z-
scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were lower than 
those observed in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with 
stable, virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were 
randomised to either replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(n = 48) or continue on their original regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.   
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received 
treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar 
spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -
0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of 
randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.184 and 
-0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and stavudine or 
zidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 
was similar between the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group and the stavudine 
or zidovudine treatment group.  Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate treatment group compared to the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  
One tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treated subject and no stavudine or zidovudine treated 
subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  BMD Z-
scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects 
who were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were 
not adjusted for height and weight. 
Chronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive 
patients aged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, 
elevated serum ALT (≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 
months] were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 52) or placebo 
(n = 54) for 72 weeks.  
No subjects met the primary safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in lumbar spine BMD.  In 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean (SD) lumbar spine 
BMD Z-score was -0.43 (0.764) and -0.28 (0.813), and mean total body BMD Z-score 
was -0.20 (1.126) and -0.26 (0.878), respectively, at baseline.  The mean (SD) change in 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to week 72 in subjects receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate was -0.05 (0.310) and 0.07 (0.377) in those receiving placebo.  BMD 
Z-scores were not adjusted for height and weight. The mean change in whole body BMD 
Z-score in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was -0.15 (0.379) and 0.06 
(0.361) in those receiving placebo.  The mean percentage increase in whole body and 
lumbar spine BMD from baseline to week 72 was 2.84% and 4.95%, respectively, in 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  These mean percentage increases in 
whole body and lumbar spine BMD were 2.53% and 3.19% less, respectively, when 
compared to subjects receiving placebo.  Three subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had a decrease of > 4% in spine 
BMD. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities

hepatitis (see Section 4.4). 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Flares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been 
reported in patients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy. Post-treatment 
exacerbations are usually associated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to 
be self-limited. However, severe exacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported. 
Hepatic function should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical and 
laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. If 
appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In patients with 
advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since 
post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
Liver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated 
liver disease. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in 
patients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HBV infected patients, 
clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after 
discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC (interaction also described in Section 4.5): 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine is not recommended. 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40–60% 
increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-
related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have 
been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a 
dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, 
possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) 
didanosine. A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological 
failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Co- administration of Viread and didanosine is not recommended as this may result in an 
increased risk of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic 
acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported (see section 4.4). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Interaction with didanosine: Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 
didanosine is not recommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure 
to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see 
section 4.5). Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been 
reported. 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Pancreatitis is listed in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC: 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 
Uncommon: pancreatitis 
There are also warning statements in Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the Viread SmPC 
regarding the risk of pancreatitis associated with the interaction with didanosine (see 
above). 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Lactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatic steatosis, has been 
reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. The preclinical and clinical data suggest 
that the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis, a class effect of nucleoside analogues, is 
low for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, as tenofovir is structurally related to 
nucleoside analogues, this risk cannot be excluded. Early symptoms (symptomatic 
hyperlactataemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal 
pain), non specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid 
and/or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness). Lactic 
acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure or 
renal failure. Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of

Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued in the setting of 
symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, 
or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels. 
Caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any patient 
(particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for 
liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol). 
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may 
constitute a special risk. 
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and lipodystrophy are associated 
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8c). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Lactic acidosis, usually 
associated with hepatic steatosis, has been reported with the use of nucleoside 
analogues. Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued in the setting of 
symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, 
or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels (see section 4.4). 
Lactic acidosis is listed in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC: 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: 
Rare: lactic acidosis 
There are also warning statements in Section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the Viread SmPC 
regarding the risk of lactic acidosis associated with the interaction with didanosine (see 
above). 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Precautionary statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Lipodystrophy: Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the 
redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of 
these events are currently unknown. Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A 
connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors and lipoatrophy and 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been hypothesised. A higher risk of 
lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with 
drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated 
metabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical 
signs of fat redistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting 
serum lipids and blood glucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically 
appropriate. 
Tenofovir is structurally related to nucleoside analogues hence the risk of lipodystrophy 
cannot be excluded. However, 144-week clinical data from antiretroviral-naïve HIV 
infected patients indicate that the risk of lipodystrophy was lower with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate than with stavudine when administered with lamivudine and 
efavirenz. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and lipodystrophy are associated 
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8c). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat 
(lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous 
fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat 
accumulation (buffalo hump). 
In a 144-week controlled clinical study in antiretroviral-naïve patients that compared 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and 
efavirenz, patients who received tenofovir disoproxil had a significantly lower incidence 
of lipodystrophy compared with patients who received stavudine. The tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate arm also had significantly smaller mean increases in fasting 
triglycerides and total cholesterol than the comparator arm. 
Update of labeling as appropriate.

Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC states the following: 
Resistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate resistance 
have been identified. In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, rtL180M, 
and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine 
showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus. 
HBV strains expressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V 
mutations associated with resistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir 
ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-type virus. HBV strains expressing the 
adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and rtN236T showed a susceptibility 
to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus. Viruses containing the 
rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold that of 
wild-type virus. 
Clinical resistance: Four hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n 
= 250) and HBeAg positive (GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients were evaluated for 
genotypic changes in HBV polymerase from baseline. Genotypic evaluations performed 
on all patients initially randomised to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate arm (i.e 
excluding patients who received double-blind adefovir dipivoxil and then switched to 
open-label tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n 
= 39), week 96 (n = 24) and week 144 (n = 6) and week 192 (n = 5) on tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate monotherapy, showed that no mutations associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate resistance have developed. 
In study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or 
adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate for up to 48 weeks. Genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV 
isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid 
substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were identified 
in these isolates.

Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Current approved Viread SmPC text is as follows: 
Statement in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population: Viread is not recommended for use in children The clinical data 
available in HIV-1 infected adolescents are inadequate to support the use of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate in this population and no data are currently available in younger 
children. 
No data are currently available in paediatric patients infected with chronic hepatitis B. 
Statement in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Viread may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk 
are currently unknown. 
Statement in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
d. Paediatric population 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomised trial (study 
GS-US-104-0321) in 87 HIV-1 infected adolescent patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in 
combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks. 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population:  
HIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 
to < 18 years of age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 45) or placebo 
(n = 42) in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 
placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean 
total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at baseline. Mean 
changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score 
for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and placebo groups, respectively. The 
mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group 
compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate group and one adolescent in the placebo group had 
significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 28 patients 
receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 48/56 
 
 
 
 
BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. 
The efficacy and safety data derived from this study do not support the use of Viread in 
adolescents. 
Proposed additional Viread SmPC text specific to the treatment of pediatric patients is as 
follows (based on proposed updates to the Viread 245 mg SmPC): 
Statements in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1: The safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV-1 infected 
children under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. 
Chronic hepatitis B: The safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in children 
with chronic hepatitis B aged 2 to < 12 years or weighing < 35 kg have not been 
established.  No data are available. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment: The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in 
paediatric patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
Statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Renal and bone effects in paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. 
Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis 
the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment 
(including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation. 
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported 
in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-
0352 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to 
treatment and monitored during treatment as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient 
receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one 
week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose 
concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are 
suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained to 
consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). 
Renal impairment 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in paediatric patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should not be initiated 
in paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued in paediatric 
patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy. 
Bone effects:  
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients,, consultation with 
an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1: 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-
0321 and GS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 
years) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 93) or 
placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 
48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were consistent with those 
observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in adults (see section 4.8 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1). 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 
infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on their 
stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Of 89 patients (2 to < 12 years) who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in study GS-
US-104-0352 (median exposure 104 weeks), 4 patients discontinued from the study due

to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. 
Chronic hepatitis B: 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomised study (study GS-US-174-
0115) in 106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B 
receiving treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 52) or placebo 
(n = 54) for 72 weeks.  The adverse reactions observed in adolescent patients who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were consistent with those 
observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in adults (see section 4.8 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1).  
Reductions in BMD have been observed in HBV-infected adolescents.  The BMD Z-
scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were lower than 
those observed in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with 
stable, virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were 
randomised to either replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(n = 48) or continue on their original regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.   
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received 
treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar 
spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -
0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of 
randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.184 and 
-0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and stavudine or 
zidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 
was similar between the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group and the stavudine 
or zidovudine treatment group.  Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate treatment group compared to the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  
One tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treated subject and no stavudine or zidovudine treated 
subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  BMD Z-
scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects 
who were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were 
not adjusted for height and weight. 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 4 out of 89 paediatric patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate discontinued due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal 
tubulopathy (median tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure was 104 weeks). 
Chronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive 
patients aged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, 
elevated serum ALT (≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 
months] were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 52) or placebo 
(n = 54) for 72 weeks.  
No subjects met the primary safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in lumbar spine BMD.  In 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean (SD) lumbar spine 
BMD Z-score was -0.43 (0.764) and -0.28 (0.813), and mean total body BMD Z-score 
was -0.20 (1.126) and -0.26 (0.878), respectively, at baseline.  The mean (SD) change in 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to week 72 in subjects receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate was -0.05 (0.310) and 0.07 (0.377) in those receiving placebo.  The 
mean change in whole body BMD Z-score in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate was -0.15 (0.379) and 0.06 (0.361) in those receiving placebo. BMD Z-scores 
were not adjusted for height and weight. The mean percentage increase in whole body 
and lumbar spine BMD from baseline to week 72 was 2.84% and 4.95%, respectively, in 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  These mean percentage increases in 
whole body and lumbar spine BMD were 2.53% and 3.19% less, respectively, when 
compared to subjects receiving placebo.  Three subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had a decrease of > 4% in spine 
BMD. 
The proposed Viread oral granules SmPC also contains statements indicating that limited 
clinical data are available at the 6.5 mg/kg dose of the oral granules and therefore close 
monitoring of efficacy and safety is needed, and that investigations are planned to further 
substantiate the dose in children from 2 years of age. 
Following the approval of the pediatric applications, renal risk minimization activities 
will be updated to include information on HIV-1 infected children and adolescents and 
HBV infected adolescents.  Educational brochures specific to the use of Viread in these 
pediatric populations will be distributed to pediatric prescribers (see Renal Safety 
Concern).

The PI was updated accordingly and has been consolidated with parallel procedures X/105/G and 
II/119. 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
This section was revised and the indication was restricted to better delineate the population of children 
most in need for immediate treatment. The therapeutic indication was extended for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis B in adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age with: compensated liver disease and 
evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication, persistently elevated serum ALT levels 
and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis.  
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration”  
This section was updated to include dose recommendations for treatment of adolescents infected with 
HBV. 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
Warnings on the management of renal and bone effects were revised. 
This section was revised to inform on the uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone 
and renal toxicity and to mention that the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained. 
Therefore warnings were introduced to promote a multidisciplinary management of paediatric patients 
to adequately weigh the need for treatment, to adequately settle the monitoring and to foresee the 
need for supplementation. 
Furthermore physicians are alerted that significant laboratory abnormality suggestive of renal toxicity 
during treatment should trigger specialised consultation. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
This section was updated to reflect safety data from study GS-US-174-0115.

2.  conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In adults, tenofovir has become a standard of care (besides entecavir) for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis B, due to its potency and high genetic barrier (no emerging resistance at 5 years). From the 
efficacy point of view, it is expected to show similar results in paediatric patients. In this pivotal study 
GS-US-174-0115 a striking superiority of TDF over placebo was demonstrated on the primary endpoint 
(proportion of patients with HBV DNA <400 copies/ml). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Beyond the sustained virologic suppression, the ultimate goal for treatment is to achieve HBs Ag 
seroconversion (translating a cure) or at least a stable HBeAg seroconversion. TDF showed greater 
potency over placebo not only on the primary endpoint but also on all secondary endpoints. However, 
this is not translated into a major differential in terms of HBeAg seroconversion rate, illustrating the 
need for a life long treatment for the vast majority of adolescents. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The renal and bone toxicity are a source of particular concern for the long-term use of TDF. This is true 
for both adults and paediatric patients especially considering that they are in evolving modelling 
process. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The long-term effect of TDF on bone modelling and the potential reversibility of bone toxicity cannot be 
determined from the non clinical and clinical data available. However, it is acknowledged that given the 
lack of correlation between BMD and clinical events, it remains theoretical risk.  Moreover, the 
reversibility of the renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  
Warnings were added to the SmPC to alert physicians on the uncertainties on the long term effect of 
bone and renal toxicity and the fact that reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained. A 
statement was introduced to promote a multidisciplinary management of paediatric patients to 
adequately weigh the need for treatment, to adequately settle the monitoring and to foresee the need 
for supplementation. Promoting multidisciplinary approach appears pragmatic based on the SAG input 
that management is to be tailored to the child and mostly refer to good clinical practice in paediatric.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Overall based on the MAH’s responses and SAG input the CHMP consider that Viread can be approved 
in adolescents according to the following indication: 
Hepatitis B infection 
Viread 245 mg film coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with:

The SmPC was revised to include warnings to alert physicians on the uncertainties on the long term 
effect of bone and renal toxicity and the fact that reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully 
ascertained. A statement was introduced to promote a multidisciplinary management of paediatric 
patients to adequately weigh the need for treatment, to adequately settle the monitoring and to 
foresee the need for supplementation. Promoting multidisciplinary approach appears pragmatic based 
on the SAG input that management is to be tailored to the paediatric patient and mostly refer to good 
clinical practice in paediatric. 
Further studies are included in the RMP that will help to better understand the safety in this population. 
3.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic 
II 
indication or modification of an approved one 
Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order extend the indication for the 
treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age. The annex II, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
annex II, labelling and package leaflet. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Risk management system and PSUR cycle 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan of the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any 
subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
Assessment report  
EMA/797672/2012  
Page 54/56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached  
•  at the request of the EMA 
The PSUR cycle for the product will follow a yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use Viread in adults and/or paediatric patients are provided with a physician educational 
pack containing the Summary of Product Characteristics and an appropriate educational brochure, as 
detailed below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
HIV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
HBV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
HIV paediatric educational brochure 
HBV paediatric educational brochure 
The HIV and HBV renal educational brochures in adult should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV and HBV infected patients associated with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Viread 
That Viread should only be used in patients with impaired renal function if the potential benefits 
of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks 
The importance of dose interval adjustment of Viread in adult patients with creatinine clearance 
of 30-49 ml/min 
That Viread is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min).  If no alternative treatment is available, prolonged dose intervals may be used. 
That use of Viread should be avoided with concomitant or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal 
products.  If Viread is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely 
monitored according to the recommended schedule. 
That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating Viread therapy 
The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Viread therapy 
Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of 
additional risk factors for renal impairment 
That if serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance decreases during therapy to 
< 50 ml/min then renal function should be re-evaluated within one week.  If creatinine clearance 
is confirmed as < 50 ml/min or serum phosphate decreases to < 1.0 mg/dl then consideration 
should be given to interrupting Viread therapy. 
Instructions on the use of the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
The HIV and HBV paediatric educational brochure should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
That a multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of paediatric patients 
That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV and HBV infected patients associated with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Viread 
That Viread is not recommended for use in paediatric patients with renal impairment

Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of 
additional risk factors for renal impairment 
That if serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient 
receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week. If 
renal abnormalities are detected or suspected then consultation with a nephrologist should be 
obtained to consider interruption of Viread treatment 
That Viread may cause a reduction in BMD and the effects of Viread associated changes in BMD 
on long term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown in paediatric patients 
That if bone abnormalities are detected or suspected then consultation with an endocrinologist 
and/or nephrologist should be obtained

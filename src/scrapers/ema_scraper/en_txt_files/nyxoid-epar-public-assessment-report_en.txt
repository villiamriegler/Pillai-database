2.  Scientific discussion 
Problem statement 
Naloxone  is  a  widely  accepted  opioid  antagonist  used  to  reverse  respiratory  depression  caused  by  opioid 
overdose.  It  has  been  used  in  emergency  medicine  since  the  1970s.  Naloxone  is  listed  by  World  Health 
Organisation  (WHO)  as  an  “essential  medicine”  and  is  traditionally  available  in  injectable  forms.  Parenteral 
(IV,  IM or SC) naloxone is commonly used in the treatment of reversing opioid overdose with a dose range 
from 0.4 mg to 2 mg. 
Naloxone is a µ-opioid competitive antagonist with affinity for µ-opioid receptor (and partly at the δ-opioid 
receptor) that competes with other drugs for this receptor thereby controlling this specific opioid receptor. 
Due to this property, naloxone is able to reverse the effects of opioids such as heroin by preventing their 
metabolites to influence the receptor’s normal function. This reversal effect is very rapid.  
About the product 
Naloxone  1.8  mg  nasal  spray,  solution  is  intended  for  immediate  administration  as  emergency  therapy  for 
known or suspected opioid overdose as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.  
The  nasal  spray  has  the  potential  to  remove  the  psychological  and  policy  barriers  which  can  prevent 
availability  of  existing  injectable  forms  of  naloxone  for  emergency  administration  in  the  first  minutes 
following an opioid overdose.  
The  rationale  for  the  development  of  intranasal  naloxone  builds  on  the  background  of  take  home  naloxone 
(THN) programmes and improves on current improvised IN naloxone use.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that the Applicant did not 
demonstrate the unmet medical need.

2.1.  Quality aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as nasal spray, solution in a single dose container containing 1.8 mg of 
naloxone (as hydrochloride dihydrate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: trisodium citrate dihydrate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and 
purified water. 
The product is available in a type I glass vial with siliconised chlorobutyl stopper containing 0.1 ml solution. 
The secondary packaging (actuator) is comprised of polypropylene and stainless steel, as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.1.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate is (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-(prop-2-enyl)-3,14-
dihydroxy-4,5-epoxymorphinan-6-one hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula 
C19H22ClNO4·2H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 399.9 and the following structure: 
Figure 1 – Structural formula of naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate 
The active substance is a white or almost white, hygroscopic, crystalline powder, freely soluble in water, 
soluble in ethanol (96 per cent) and practically insoluble in toluene. 
The structure of the molecule and its hydrate form have been characterised using common analytical 
techniques. Analysis has confirmed that naloxone hydrochloride used to manufacture Nyxoid is present in the 
dihydrate form. 
The finished product contains the active substance in the form of a solution and consequently properties such 
as particle size distribution and polymorphism of the active substance of are of no relevance when it comes to 
clinical performance of the product. 
Naloxone exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres; this is controlled routinely 
using standard techniques.

2.1.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a nasal spray, solution in a single dose container containing 1.8 mg of 
naloxone (as hydrochloride dihydrate) as active substance. The solution is contained in a Type I clear glass 
vial, sealed with a chlorobutyl elastomer stopper/plunger that is fitted into a non-reusable, Unit Dose System 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 12/59 
  
  
(UDS) nasal spray which delivers 100 μl of solution as a single dose. The finished product is comprised of two 
individually blister-packaged units of naloxone 1.8mg nasal spray contained in a single cardboard carton. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a naloxone hydrochloride solution suitable for 
nasal administration. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains Quality by Design (QbD) elements.  
A process risk assessment was performed to identify any areas that require risk mitigation or further 
development activities prior to process validation and commercialization. This was made by identifying the 
product CQAs and the critical process parameters (CPP) with respect to the operations and activities of 
component supply, manufacturing process and packaging process. The methodology used for this purpose 
comprised a high-level and extended risk assessment leading to an integrated risk mitigation plan. None of 
the risks identified were assigned as high. The medium risks identified in the risk assessment were further 
assessed in an extended risk assessment and corresponding integrated risk mitigation plans were 
recommended. 
Naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate is freely soluble in water and therefore is appropriate for delivery in an 
aqueous solution. As mentioned above, the particle size of active substance is not relevant for the 
performance of the nasal solution. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Compatibility of the active substance and the excipients was confirmed in the stability studies. 
The pH of formulation is important in order to avoid irritation of the nasal mucosa and the pH of the solution 
has an impact on the product stability. Therefore, a buffer is included in the formulation to control the 
product pH. 
The original indication claimed by the applicant included children of all ages including new-borns. However, 
the pharmaceutical development section of the dossier lacked a discussion on the suitability of the proposed 
product for the paediatric population, including a discussion on suitability of the tip of the nasal spray device 
(diameter of 1 cm) for the size of the nostrils/nasal cavity of the target age group(s). This constituted a 
major objection. In recognition of the lack of available data to support the original proposed indication 
including children, the applicant decided to revise the indication at the request of the CHMP to include adults 
and adolescents aged 14 and above only. 
The nasal spray produces a fine mist of droplets. The spray is formed by the liquid exiting the device spray 
orifice and was characterised. Pump delivery, spray content uniformity and droplet size distribution were also 
measured and limits included in the finished product specification. 
During pharmaceutical development of the finished product, the applicant assessed the impact of angle of 
orientation on the performance of the nasal spray, and submitted data concerning the effect of angle of 
orientation on pump delivery and droplet size distribution. The angle of actuation was found to have no 
impact on the volume of spray delivered (pump delivery). Droplet size distribution was measured by laser 
diffraction. Results showed d10, d50 and d90 were very similar with all angle orientations tested. These data 
confirmed that the spray characteristics and doses delivered were consistent and comparable for upright or 
angled spray delivery, and that the device performance was orientation independent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 13/59 
  
  
The effect of dropping, vibration and shaking on device performance was also studied. Extractables and 
leachables from the primary container (vial, stopper/plunger and actuator) were also assessed. A discussion 
on potential delamination of glass vials was provided, being supported by long-term stability data.  
Prior to use, the drug product solution is in contact with the vial and plunger. During use the drug product 
passes through the actuator with momentary contact. The tip of the nasal actuator temporarily comes in 
contact with the patient during use. Studies were performed to determine the potential extractables from 
each component with patient and product contact.  
Controlled extraction studies targeting organic and inorganic compounds were performed on the 
polypropylene actuator, chlorobutyl elastomer stopper/plunger and Type I glass vial to determine the 
compounds which could potentially leach into the finished product from each component. 
One lot of finished product was placed on stability for 36 months and will be monitored for the presence of 
organic and inorganic leachables using the same analytical procedures used for the extraction studies. 
The finished product is supplied as a unit dose delivery system. The formulation contains no antimicrobial 
preservatives.  
The container closure system is comprised of primary and secondary packaging. The primary packaging is a 
type I glass vial with siliconised chlorobutyl stopper containing 0.1 ml solution. The material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The secondary packaging comprises a container holder, into which the primary 
container is seated, which is subsequently assembled with an actuator to form the secondary packaging. The 
finished product is individually packaged in a blister pack with peel-off backing. The blister is not intended to 
enhance the stability of the product and is used as protective package for storage and labelling purposes. 
Two individual blister packs are packaged in a cardboard outer carton to form the patient pack, in line with 
posology. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for 
the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: component preparation, formulation, filling and 
bioburden reduction step, inspection and assembly, and packaging. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The process is a 
standard manufacturing process, and the manufacturer is experienced in manufacturing nasal spray unit dose 
devices and its components. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description 
of product (visual), description of container (visual), pH (potentiometric, Ph. Eur.), identification (HPLC, UV), 
assay (HPLC), specified degradation products (HPLC), unspecified degradation products (HPLC), total 
degradation products (HPLC), spray content uniformity (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), microbial

limits (enumeration, Ph. Eur.), osmolality (osmometer, Ph. Eur.), pump delivery (weight), droplet size 
distribution (laser diffraction). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description of product, description of container, pH, identification, assay, specified 
degradation products, unspecified degradation products, total degradation products, spray content 
uniformity, uniformity of dosage units, microbial limits, osmolality, pump delivery, and droplet size 
distribution. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes were observed at 
any of the conditions tested 
Forced degradation studies were performed using stressed conditions: heat, acid, base, oxidation and light. It 
was shown that the product is sensitive to oxidation and basic conditions. 
In addition, a single batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Samples of the finished product solution were exposed to light in their 
primary container closure (vial and plunger stopper) and in their secondary container closure (container 
holder and actuator). 
A study was performed according to Ph. Eur. 2.2.18 to determine the freezing point of the finished product 
solution. The freezing point was determined, which was the basis for assigning a special storage condition ‘do 
not freeze’. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and the storage precaution ‘do not 
freeze’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.1.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The active substance naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate is described in the European Pharmacopoeia. A valid 
CEP has been provided for the active substance. 
The finished product is in the form of an aqueous solution for administration as a nasal spray.  
Pharmaceutical development is well conducted taking in consideration the target population. The spray plume 
release in the nasal cavity has been demonstrated not to be significantly affected by the body position. The 
finished product contains well-known compendial excipients, widely used materials in pharmaceutical 
formulations, with a long history of safe use in pharmaceutical technology. All excipients in the formulation, 
as well as the amounts used, have been properly justified. 
The manufacturing process is a standard process. Although this is not a sterile dosage form, it involves steps 
to keep bioburden low, which improves the stability of the finished product. Data concerning process 
development is considered acceptable. The manufacturing process critical steps, IPCs and finished product 
specification have been well identified and justified. 
Stability studies were conducted according to the ICH recommendations, and data supporting the proposed 
shelf-life of 24 months with a special condition ‘do not freeze’ has been provided. 
2.1.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application was supported by the literature review and a number of studies performed by the Applicant, 
predominantly to support new administration route.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 16/59 
  
  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
When administered by IV, IM or SC routes, naloxone rapidly antagonises mild respiratory depression caused 
by small doses of opioids but the effect is temporary as it is extensively and rapidly metabolised. This results 
in a duration of action that is generally shorter than that of the opioid and as such, the effects of the opioid 
may return as the effects of naloxone dissipate, resulting in the requirement of additional doses of naloxone.   
The intranasal route is one of the most permeable and highly vascularised sites for administration, ensuring 
rapid absorption and like the intravenous route, it by-passes the first pass metabolism. Naloxone injection 
kits are currently used off label with an improvised IN atomiser by some medical and trained professionals as 
a route of IN naloxone administration. However, the naloxone concentration of such preparations requires 
administration of a large volume that is not optimal for IN delivery; as the naloxone solution can also run out 
of the nasopharynx and can be swallowed which contributes very little to the overall absorption, due to the 
low oral bioavailability of naloxone. To maximise the bioavailability of naloxone, the Applicant has developed 
a proprietary intranasal product that contains an appropriate concentration of naloxone to provide an 
effective dose within the accepted volumes, suitable for administration in the nasal cavity.  
The pharmacology associated with naloxone has been reported extensively in the literature and the 
Applicant’s additional in vitro and in vivo studies are consistent with data reported previously. The 
pharmacodynamic profile of naloxone following intranasal administration is anticipated to be similar to the 
well-established profile following the injectable routes of administration such as IV and IM. The Applicant has 
not performed any further in vivo pharmacodynamic studies supporting the intranasal administration. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following intranasal administration in the rat, naloxone is absorbed rapidly (within 1 minute) and the decline 
from the initial peak is equally rapid with plasma concentration of naloxone at six hours post-dose being 
minimal.  Plasma concentrations of naloxone increase in a slightly less than dose proportional manner 
between the 4.9 and 19.4 mg/kg intranasal doses. 
Following oral administration, the pharmacokinetic profile of naloxone in animals is characterised by a rapid 
absorption and low bioavailability due to an extensive first pass effect.  Naloxone is predominantly and 
rapidly metabolised by conjugation pathways to form naloxone-3-glucuronide, which is the major metabolite 
detected in humans and in the animal species tested. Since naloxone-3-glucuronide is inactive, the duration 
of naloxone activity is very limited. Naloxone distributes to all tissues, nonetheless, it is characterised by a 
high brain to plasma concentration ratio due to its high lipid solubility. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
The safety of intranasal administration, the intended human route, has been assessed in a single and a 7- 
day repeated study in male SD rats. Intranasal administration of naloxone for 7 days (up to 19 mg/kg/day) 
did not cause any mortality or any treatment related changes indicative of toxicity and did not cause any 
macroscopic or microscopic lesions in the nasal cavity and related tissues (oesophagus, larynx, lungs with 
bronchi, nasopharynx, olfactory bulbs, stomach and trachea). Minor clinical signs i.e. salivation (at all doses) 
and gasping (in a single male animal at mid dose) were observed. Salivation was considered a secondary 
effect, most likely induced by small quantities of the test article migrating into the oral cavity following dosing 
and not a direct pharmacologic effect of the test article.

Page 17/59 
  
  
In the rat, following a single intranasal administration, at the highest non-toxic dose tested, the plasma Cmax 
is 1327-fold greater than the plasma Cmax achieved following a single intranasal dose (4 mg) in human 
subjects and following a single intravenous dose (0.4 mg) in human subjects and is 7962-fold greater than a 
single intramuscular dose (0.4 mg) in human subjects. The plasma AUC0-∞ is 294-fold greater than the 
AUC0-∞ achieved following a single intranasal dose (4 mg) in human subjects and 1471-fold greater than the 
plasma AUC0-∞ achieved following a single intravenous dose or intramuscular dose (0.4 mg) in human 
subjects. These safety margins are considered adequate and satisfactory.

In Phase I a PECsurfacewater of 0.02 µg/L was calculated for naloxone. As it exceeds the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L, a Phase II fate and effects assessment were conducted. 
The  phase  II  studies  comprised  the  determination  of  the  adsorption  coefficient,  an  aerobic  transformation 
test  in  aquatic  sediment  systems  as  well  as  chronic  toxicity  studies  in  aquatic  organisms  and  an  activated 
sludge respiration test.  
Naloxone  is  not  PBT  substance  and  the  results  of  the  water/sediment  system  demonstrated  that  it  shifts 
significantly from the water phase to the sediment phase. The degradation products in sediment are ≤ 10 %. 
A  further  assessment  of  the  sediment  phase  was  provided  in  phase  IIB  with  a  chronic  sediment  toxicity 
study.  
A  new  adsorption/desorption  test  for  naloxone  using  3  different  soil  samples  should  be  performed  and  the 
predicted environmental concentrations in sediment recalculated. Regarding the results, the possible effect of 
naloxone into the terrestrial environment should be discussed. 
The applicant has committed to provide this adsorption/desorption test as a post-approval measure.

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Naloxone has been used in opioid overdose management for over 40 years to reverse respiratory depression 
and is available in injectable forms in doses ranging from 0.4 mg to 2 mg. When administered by IV, IM or 
SC routes, naloxone rapidly antagonises mild respiratory depression caused by small doses of opioids but the 
effect  is  temporary  as  it  is  extensively  and  rapidly  metabolised.  This  results  in  a  duration  of  action  that  is 
generally  shorter than  that  of the opioid  and  as  such,  the  effects  of the  opioid  may  return  as the  effects  of 
naloxone dissipates, resulting in the requirement of additional doses of naloxone.   
The  pharmacology  and  safety  pharmacology  associated  with  naloxone  has  been  reported  extensively  in  the 
literature.  Additional  proprietary  studies  from  the  Applicant  confirm  the  pharmacology  and  safety 
pharmacology  data  available  in  the  literature.    Similarly,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  naloxone  has  been 
widely reported in the literature. The Applicant has a limited number of proprietary GLP toxicokinetic studies 
with  naloxone  (administered  by  oral  or  intravenous  routes)  that  again  support  the  data  available  in  the 
literature.  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  has  conducted  a  short-term  (up  to  7  days)  Good  Laboratory  Practice 
(GLP) intranasal toxicity study in the rat with associated toxicokinetic evaluation at Day 1. 
The  nonclinical  studies  performed  with  naloxone  hydrochloride  (administered  by  oral  or  intravenous  routes) 
not only confirm the data already available in the literature (general toxicity) but also provide additional new 
information,  including  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies,  reproductive  and  developmental  studies. 
Intranasal administration of naloxone for up to 7 days (up to 19 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested) in the 
rat, does not cause any local irritation at the highest doses tested and does not cause any additional toxicity 
to that observed with oral and intravenous administration nor are any target organs of toxicity identified (in 
rodents and dogs). Based on the nonclinical data generated from studies conducted with naloxone, no new or 
unexpected  toxicities  are  anticipated  with  the  intranasal  naloxone  product.  The  nonclinical  data  support  the 
conclusion that intranasal naloxone is safe for its intended use in the treatment of opioid agonist overdose.  
With  regards  to  ecotoxicity,  the  available  data  do  not  allow  to  conclude  definitively  on  the  potential  risk  of 
naloxone  to  the  environment.  A  new  adsorption/desorption  test  for  naloxone  using  3  different  soil  samples 
should be performed and the predicted environmental concentrations in sediment recalculated. Regarding the 
results,  the  possible  effect  of  naloxone  into  the  terrestrial  environment  should  be  discussed.  The  Applicant 
has committed to provide this data as a post-approval measure.  
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  applicant  presented  non-clinical  arguments  that  support  the  Marketing  Authorisation  application  for 
intranasal naloxone. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This MAA draws on the availability of published data supporting the use of naloxone in this indication covering 
efficacy and safety data for the use of naloxone: 
• 
In the treatment of opioid overdose. 
o  As part of take home naloxone (THN) programmes.

o  For intranasal administration. 
In addition, a comparative Phase I study was presented. This was a 5-part, open-label, randomised, single 
dose, crossover study in healthy subjects to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of naloxone 
nasal spray (1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg naloxone hydrochloride) and the reference product given as a 0.4 mg 
intramuscular and 0.4 mg intravenous dose. Data from the study has been used to demonstrate how IN use 
in the claimed indication is justified considering the performance of the IN formulation against the IM 
reference product. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study MR903-1501 A 5-part, open-label, randomised, single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects to 
compare the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of intranasal MR903 (1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg) and naloxone 
hydrochloride given as a 0.4 mg intramuscular and 0.4 mg intravenous dose.  
Methods 
The primary objectives were; to assess the pharmacokinetics of IN MR903 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg compared 
with 0.4 mg naloxone given as an IM and IV dose and, to compare the early partial exposure to naloxone, 
measured by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated from the time of dosing to the 
median time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) of the IM reference treatment (AUCp), 
following IN and IM administration, with the aim of showing that the AUCp for IN administration was non-
inferior to the AUCp for IM administration. A secondary PK objective was to determine the absolute 
bioavailability of naloxone when administered via the IN route, by comparison of the dose-adjusted AUC 
values following IN and IV administration. Exploratory objectives were to assess the relative onset and 
duration of action of the different routes of administration by comparison of the exploratory parameters, time 
taken to reach 50% of maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), (t50) and half-value duration 
(HVD). Also, to assess the relative time taken to reach peak concentrations following IN and IV 
administration, by comparing IN time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) with IV tmax+time 
to cannulate subjects (tcan). 
No formal assessment of bioequivalence was planned, however, assuming moderate variability for the PK 
parameters AUCt and Cmax (i.e. a SD of 0.35 to 0.4 for the period differences on log scale), and a true ratio 
of 1, a sample size of 28 subjects for each comparison would provide 80% to 90% chance for observing a 
90% confidence interval which lies entirely between 80% and 125%). Assuming that 20% of subjects would 
not provide valid PK data for a comparison of interest, 35 subjects were to be randomised to the study. 
A total of 89 subjects were enrolled into the study and 38 were randomised and received IMP. The PK 
population included all 38 healthy subjects who were randomised and received IMP. 6 subjects discontinued 
from the study; one subject due to an unrelated AE, 1 subject due to subject’s choice and 4 subjects were 
excluded due to a positive result in the drugs of abuse test. Subjects were between 20 and 54 years old. The 
mean age of subjects was 32.4 years. Twenty-seven (71.1%) subjects were male and 11 (28.9%) were

female. The mean (SD) weight at screening was 72.40 (9.173) kg (median 71.55 kg) and mean height was 
175.5 (8.02) cm (median 177.0 cm). 
Subjects received a single dose of study drug on Day 1 of each study period randomised across five study 
periods as follows: 
Each administration was performed after a fasting period of at least 8 h and fasting was maintained for at 
least 4 hours after dosing. There was a minimum of 4 days between dosing in each study period. 
Blood samples for PK assessments were drawn at pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.5, 15, 30, 45 minutes 
and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after dosing (19 samples per study period). 
Blood samples, 6 mL each, were drawn into tubes containing K2EDTA anticoagulant. Samples were 
centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection. Following centrifugation (1500 g, 4°C, 15 minutes) the plasma 
was transferred via pipette into two labelled 3 mL polypropylene tubes and stored at -20°C within 1 hour of 
collection. The plasma samples were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) methodology using validated bioanalytical assays for naloxone and naloxone-3-glucuronide. 
Safety was assessed by documentation of adverse events, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, physical 
examinations, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) and recorded on the standard electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF) pages and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) data form.

The parameter for the early partial exposure (AUCp) was based on the AUC measured up to the median tmax

reference treatment, the 2 mg IN demonstrated very similar exposure with a bioavailability ratio of 98.07%,

90% CI ranged from 73.15% to 131.48%. For the 1 mg and 4 mg IN treatments the ratios were 46.09% and 
266.58% respectively, reflecting the differences in administered IN doses. 
Considering the overall exposure, the comparative dose-adjusted AUCt ratio of 50.81% for the IN 1 mg to 
the IM 0.4 mg reference is supportive of the assumption of a 2:1 availability ratio (IN:IM) between the two 
routes of administration. The non-dose-adjusted ratio was 127.04% and for the IN 2 mg 235.42%. For the 
highest IN dose the overall exposure ratio to IM was 483.39%. Bioavailability ratios for the IN treatments 
relative to IV 0.4 mg were similar to when the IM was used as reference, at 125.56%, 234.20% and 
481.07% for the ascending doses. The dose adjusted bioavailabilities of the IN treatments compared with the 
IM treatment ranged from 47.08% (for the IN 2 mg) to 50.81% (for the IN 1 mg). Likewise, the dose-
adjusted absolute bioavailability results using the IV as reference ranged from 46.84% (for the IN 2 mg) to 
50.22% (for the IN 1 mg). 
Cmax ratios ranged from 121.77% to 491.27% for the IN treatments compared with the IM reference and, 
when adjusted for dose, from 45.05% for the IN 2 mg to 49.13% for the IN 4 mg. When compared with the 
IV reference, Cmax ratios ranged from 25.67% to 99.13% and dose adjusted Cmax ratios ranged from 
9.30% for the IN 2 mg to 10.27% for the IN 1 mg. 
Exploratory analysis comparing AUCt for the IV and IM treatments demonstrated overall exposure to be 
similar, with a bioavailability ratio of 98.84%. The IN doses were also shown to be dose proportional, with an 
AUC ratio of 106.06% for the 1 mg compared with 2 mg and 102.71% for the 4 mg compared with 2 mg and 
90% CIs falling within 80 to 125%. 
The partial areas were roughly comparable between the IN 1 and 2 mg when adjusted for dose, with a ratio 
of 93.19%, but dose-adjusted exposure was slightly higher for the 4 mg dose, with a bioavailability ratio of 
124.68% compared with the IN 2mg. Dose-adjusted Cmax ratios were similar for the 1 mg and 4 mg IN 
doses compared with the 2 mg at 107% and 106.58%. 
HVD was shortest from the IV 0.4 mg at 0.1292 h, followed by the IM 0.4 mg at 1.0864 and was longest for 
the IN treatments at 1.2461, 1.2671 and 1.3173 hours for the IN 4 mg, 2 mg and 1 mg treatments 
respectively. 
Naloxone-3-glucuronide to naloxone ratios were similar across the three intranasal treatments at 11.23, 
11.27 and 10.48 for the 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg dose levels respectively. Ratios for the IM and IV treatments 
were also similar, 3.062 for the IM and 3.333 for the IV. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No PD data has been produced by the Applicant. 
Naloxone is a μ-opioid competitive antagonist. It has an affinity for the μ-opioid receptor and works by 
competing with other relevant drugs for a space on the receptor. Due to its ability to compete and control the 
specific opioid receptors, naloxone can reverse the effects (e.g. respiratory depression) that were caused by 
heroin (or another opioid) by preventing heroin metabolites from exercising influence on the receptor’s 
normal functioning. Reversal is a fairly rapid event at the μ-opioid receptor, and partly at the δ-opioid 
receptor, the main instigators of respiratory depression in opioid consumption.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The aim of the biopharmaceutical development program was to develop an intranasal naloxone formulation 
that was accessible and easy to administer by non-healthcare professionals in a life-threatening situation. 
Nyxoid has been tested in one pivotal bioavailability study, MR903-1501, which examined three IN dose 
strengths alongside IM and IV reference treatments, with the aim of matching MR903 to the early exposure 
from the standard of care IM 0.4 mg dose.  
The bioavailability for all the MR903 doses was around 50%, higher than what is described in some literature 
for this route of administration (4%). This may be due to the much higher concentration of the formulation, 
reducing the swallowing of the naloxone. The intended dose is not formally bioequivalent to the reference IM 
0.4mg dosage. Cmax and AUC are substantially higher (roughly equivalent to a 1 mg IM for the 2 mg IN 
dose). However, early partial AUC are similar. Early concentrations from 0-6 minutes are also generally 
similar between the IM 0.4 mg and IN 2 mg naloxone.   
Studies  were  conducted  in  healthy  non-drug  using  subjects.  In  drug  abusers,  there  can  be  nose  mucosal 
differences  from  the  general  population  and  the  applicant  provided  an  extensive  discussion  on  this  topic. 
Several  alterations  exist  that  may  impact  the  absorption  of  IN  naloxone,  such  as  vasoconstriction  or  non-
allergic rhinitis which may indeed influence the rate and extent of absorption.  
With regards to the absorption area reduction, typically the area of septic perforation constitutes around 8% 
of  the  total  available  area  for  absorption,  which  indicates  that  this  is  of  no  major  concern.  As  the  applicant 
acknowledged, there may be an impact of rate and extent of absorption on IN Naloxone for the patients that 
may  not  be  fully  characterized  by  studying  the  PK  of  IN  naloxone  in  healthy  subjects.  However,  septum 
perforations occur in a small number of subjects in the target population and there is an increasing amount of 
literature  evidence  that  IN  naloxone  is  of  use  in  the  intended  patient  population.  In  addition,  given  the 
significantly higher systemic availability of 2 mg Nyxoid versus the 0.4 mg i.m. reference product, this is not 
likely to result in lack of effect. 
Regarding the recommended administration in the supine position, this was also the position used in the PK 
study and similar to what is expected to be the most common position of the patients suffering from an 
overdose. 
The  Applicant  has  not  performed  any  in  vivo  pharmacodynamic  studies  to  support  the  intranasal 
administration,  arguing  that  the  delivery  by  intranasal  route  is  anticipated  to  be  similar  to  the 
pharmacodynamic profile established following IV and IM administration. However, the proof of concept was 
not  provided  under  conditions  in  which  naloxone  is  clinically  administrated:  respiratory  depression  and  the 
consequent  pulmonary  oedema.  Under  these  conditions,  the  mixture  of  pulmonary  oedema  fluids  and  air  in 
the lungs increases as the respirations and heartbeat slow down, exuding from the mouth and nostrils as a 
characteristic “foam cone”.  
The occurrence of a foam cone may result in diminished absorption of intranasal administered naloxone due 
to drug running from the nose together with the foam cone as well as due to hypertrophy of the mucosa. As 
a result of the significantly higher systemic availability of intranasal administered Nyxoid 2 mg compared to 
the 0.4 mg intramuscular administered naloxone reference product, it could potentially still result in clinically 
effective systemic availability depending on the extent of the foam cone. 
Clearing the nares and removing the foam cone prior to intranasal administration of Nyxoid may potentially 
limit  the  diminished  contact  time  with  the  mucosa  and  increase  the  efficacy  of  Nyxoid.  Therefore,  it  is

recommended to inspect and clear the nasal airway immediately prior to administration. The SmPC has been 
updated to reflect this recommendation in section 4.2.  
No multiple dose studies were presented. Instead, repeated administration of the 2 mg IN dose have been 
simulated using the data from MR903-1501 and the principle of superposition in order to demonstrate the 
likely plasma profiles following subsequent doses of IN and IM naloxone. The plasma profile of the 2 doses, 
separated by 3 minutes apart is not much different from the single 4mg dose profile in study MR903-1501. It 
is also clear that that the titration that is possible to be obtained with the IM administration is not at all viable 
with the current IN formulation. However, it can be considered that the obtained profiles is inside the 
expected profiles in reversal of acute opioid overdose for the IM route of administration.

Summary of key literature  
Take Home Naloxone  
The concept of ‘take-home naloxone’ (THN), initiated by Strang et al. (1992; 1993) in the 1990s, is now well 
accepted and large initiatives have emerged quickly over recent years in various regions of the world. 
Globally, there is increasing introduction of pre-provision of an emergency supply of naloxone (to heroin 
users themselves, their family and friends, and also to people who work with those at risk of opioid 
overdose), which is an approach advocated by the United Nations and World Health Organisation. 
Prenoxad® (an IM injection kit) is now approved for emergency use in a non-medical setting in several 
European countries, although currently only available in the UK. There are, however, some barriers to use of 
the injectable medication: 
•  Some  people  do  not  feel  comfortable  performing  an  injection,  or  fear  needle-stick  injuries  in  this 
high-risk  patient  population  for  blood-borne  diseases  (Open  Society  Public  Health  Program,  Public 
Health Fact Sheet, 4th Nov 2012). 
• 
Furthermore,  injectable  naloxone  requires  a  certain  level  of  skill  and  training  in  order  to  ensure 
successful administration by non-health care professionals. 
Based on the rationale that more opioid-overdose deaths could be prevented if people who witness overdoses 
recognised the danger in which the victims are and were able to administer the overdose-reversal drug, 
‘take-home’ naloxone programmes have been developed to increase the availability of the antidote in places 
where overdoses are especially likely to occur. Under these programmes, an emergency supply of naloxone is 
given out, together with instructions about its administration, to drug users and their close friends, partners 
and families, as well as other individuals likely to witness overdoses, so that, in the event of an opioid 
overdose, naloxone is readily available and can be administered to the overdose victim before the arrival of 
an ambulance. 
Maxwell et al., 2006 
The first US-based THN programme in Chicago reported 319 overdose reversals between 2001 and 2006 
(Maxwell et al., 2006). The authors stated that a steady increase in heroin overdose deaths was noticed since 
1991, with a four-fold increase between 1996 and 2000. This trend reversed in 2001 when the THN 
programme was initiated, with a 20% decrease in 2001 and 10% decreases in 2002 and 2003. 
EMCDDA, 2016 
The first programmes in the United States and Europe began distributing naloxone in 1996 and a report on 
outcomes in European sites — Berlin, Germany, and Jersey, Channel Islands — was published in 2001 
(Dettmer et al., 2001). Further naloxone initiatives in Europe have been implemented in Catalonia (Spain), 
Denmark, Estonia, Italy and Norway. A number of other European countries are currently considering THN 
initiatives to prevent drug-related deaths (EMCDDA, 2016). 
EMCDDA, 2015b 
Evidence about naloxone programmes has grown. Since 2005, several studies have been published 
addressing different aspects of these programmes. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug 
Addiction (EMCDDA) recently reviewed the effectiveness of education and training interventions 
complemented by take-home naloxone, including 21 studies, and found evidence that these programmes 
decrease overdose-related mortality (EMCDDA, 2015b).

In January 2011, Scotland introduced THN as a funded public health policy. The Scottish National Naloxone 
Programme (SNNP) gives naloxone kits to people at high risk of heroin overdose both in the community and 
on release from prison. Since the start of the programme, the number of heroin-related deaths within four 
weeks of prison release has fallen each year. Wales announced a similar intention for a THN programme in 
May 2011 after a one year demonstration project. In England the N-ALIVE trial commenced in prisons in May 
2012. (Strang et al., 2013). It was a large prison-based randomised controlled trial designed to test the 
effectiveness of giving naloxone-on-release to prisoners with history of heroin use, to prevent fatal opiate 
overdoses. Prisoners taking part in the trial were randomly assigned either to treatment-as-usual or to 
treatment-as-usual plus a supply of take-home emergency naloxone. The preliminary phase involved 5,600 
prisoners on release and was completed in 2015. 
Bird et al. 2015 
A publication by Bird et al. (2015) summarises the background and rigorous set-up for before/after 
monitoring to assess the impact on high-risk opiate-fatalities. Evidence-synthesis of prospectively monitored 
small-scale THN schemes led to a performance indicator for distribution of THN-kits relative to opiate-related 
deaths. They found that the fatality-rate at opiate overdoses witnessed by THN trainees was 6% (9/153, 
95% CI: 2–11%). Based on their findings, Bird and colleagues determined that, for THN to be available at 
every witnessed opiate-overdose, a national THN-policy should aim to issue to at-risk clients around 20 times 
as many (and at the least, nine times as many) THN-kits as there are opiate-related deaths (ORDs) per 
annum. 
Dettmer et al., 2001 
Early implementation pilots provided the first data on the safety of THN provision. In the first published 
Europe-based THN pilot, conducted in Berlin (Germany) and in Jersey (Channel Islands), the researchers 
(Dettmer et al., 2001) reported 34 peer rescues from overdose in Berlin and found naloxone administration 
to be inappropriate in only one case (a cocaine overdose). All overdose victims were successfully revived. No 
increased use of heroin or occurrence of adverse effects (other than withdrawal symptoms) was observed. 
Among the five overdose reversals reported in Jersey, none involved adverse events. This study was the first 
published report of lives saved directly by the provision of THN The range of doses given raises the possibility 
that naloxone was being titrated to effect resuscitation without provoking withdrawal. The authors concluded 
that in future, family members may be trained to give emergency naloxone, and for them non-intravenous 
administration would be more realistic. 
Doe-Simkins et al., 2009 
Expanded access to naloxone for home use has occurred to date, by prescribing IM naloxone or by off-label 
use of naloxone injection by combining a prefilled syringe with a mucosal atomisation device for intranasal 
spraying. A publication by Doe-Simkins et al., (2009) describes how, in August 2006, the Boston Public 
Health Commission (BPHC) passed a public health regulation that authorised an opioid overdose prevention 
program that included IN naloxone education and distribution of the IN spray to potential bystanders of 
patients experiencing opioid overdose. Participants were taught by trained non-medical needle exchange 
staff. Over 15 months, the program provided training and IN naloxone to 385 potential bystanders, who 
reported 74 successful overdose reversals. Problems with IN naloxone were uncommon. The BPHC naloxone 
distribution program demonstrates that overdose prevention education with distribution of IN naloxone is a 
feasible public health intervention to address opioid overdose. The Massachusetts Department of Public 
Health has identified overdose prevention as a major focus area for new public health initiatives and has 
Assessment report

expanded the program to 5 additional sites that target needle exchange participants, staff at substance 
abuse treatment programs, homeless shelters, and families and friends of opioid users. 
Dwyer and colleagues, 2015 
Emergency departments (EDs) may be effective (high-yield) venues for addressing numbers of opioid deaths 
if they combine education about overdose prevention with education on appropriate actions in a witnessed 
overdose. In addition, the ED has the potential to equip patients with nasal naloxone kits as part of this 
effort. In view of this, Dwyer and colleagues (2015) evaluated the feasibility of an ED-based overdose 
prevention program and described the overdose risk knowledge, opioid use, overdoses, and overdose 
responses among participants who received overdose education and naloxone rescue kits (OEN) and 
participants who received overdose education only (OE). Program participants were surveyed by telephone 
after their ED visit about their substance use, overdose risk knowledge, history of witnessed and personal 
overdoses, and actions in a witnessed overdose including use of naloxone. 
A total of 415 ED patients received OE or OEN between January 1, 2011 and February 28, 2012. Among 
those, 51/415 (12%) completed the survey; 37/415 (73%) of those received a naloxone kit, and 14/415 
(27%) received OE only. Past 30-day opioid use was reported by 35% OEN and 36% OE, and an overdose 
was reported by 19% OEN and 29% OE. Among 27/51 (53%) of participants who witnessed another 
individual experiencing an overdose, 95% OEN and 88% OE stayed with victim, 74% OEN and 38% OE called 
911, 26% OEN and 25% OE performed rescue breathing, and 32% OEN (n=6) used a naloxone kit to reverse 
the overdose. Furthermore, the researchers did not detect statistically significant differences between OEN 
and OE-only groups in opioid use, overdose or response to a witnessed overdose. 
Walley et al., 2013a 
Walley et al. (2013a) conducted an interrupted time series analysis of opioid-related overdose death and 
acute care utilisation rates from 2002 to 2009, comparing community-year strata with high and low rates of 
Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) implementation to those with no implementation. The 
study included the 19 Massachusetts communities (geographically distinct cities and towns) with at least five 
fatal opioid overdoses in each of the years 2004 to 2006. The OEND programs were implemented among 
opioid users at risk for overdose, social service agency staff, family, and friends of opioid users. The OEND 
programs equipped people at risk for overdose and bystanders with IN naloxone rescue kits and trained them 
how to prevent, recognize, and respond to an overdose by engaging emergency medical services, providing 
rescue breathing, and delivering naloxone. Among these communities, OEND programs trained 2912 
potential bystanders who reported 327 rescues. Both community-year strata with 1-100 enrolments per 100 
000 population (adjusted rate ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.91) and community-year strata 
with greater than 100 enrolments per 100 000 population (0.54, 0.39 to 0.76) had significantly reduced 
adjusted rate ratios compared with communities with no implementation. Differences in rates of acute care 
hospital utilisation were not significant. 
No deaths were reported. Of 327 rescue attempts using naloxone reported by 212 individuals, 87% 
(286/327) were reported by users. Most rescue attempts occurred in private settings. Naloxone was 
successful in 98% (150/153) of the rescues attempts. For the three rescue attempts where naloxone was not 
successful, the people who overdosed received care from the emergency medical system and survived. In 
conclusion, opioid overdose death rates were reduced in communities where OEND was implemented. This 
study provides observational evidence that by training potential bystanders to prevent, recognise, and 
respond to opioid overdoses, OEND is an effective intervention (Walley et al, 2013a).

Clark and colleagues, 2014 
Clark and colleagues (2014), conducted a systematic review which describes the current state of the 
literature on community-based opioid overdose prevention programs (OOPPs), with particular focus on the 
effectiveness of these programs. The authors used systematic search criteria to identify relevant articles, 
which were abstracted and assigned a quality assessment score. Nineteen articles evaluating OOPPs met the 
search criteria for this systematic review. Principal findings included participant demographics, the number of 
naloxone administrations, percentage of survival in overdose victims receiving naloxone, postnaloxone 
administration outcome measures, OOPP characteristics, changes in knowledge pertaining to overdose 
responses, and barriers to naloxone administration during overdose responses. The current evidence from 
non-randomised studies suggests that bystanders (mostly opioid users) can and will use naloxone to reverse 
opioid overdoses when properly trained, and that this training can be done successfully through OOPPs (Clark 
et al, 2014). 
IN naloxone  
Barton et al., 2005 
In the US, Narcan as an initial injectable formulation was commonly used in patients suffering from a 
suspected opioid overdose. These patients often have limited peripheral venous access, making the intranasal 
route potentially very advantageous. Barton et al. (2005), investigated the use of improvised IN Narcan by 
paramedics to assess its efficacy and safety as an alternative (needleless) medication delivery route in pre-
hospital settings. They conducted a study using a prospective, non-randomised trial over a 6-month period, 
in which IN naloxone was administered by paramedics to patients with suspected opiate overdoses. All adult 
patients were encountered in the pre-hospital setting as altered mental status (AMS), ‘found down’ (FD) or 
suspected opiate overdose (OD), patients who met the criteria for naloxone administration and thus were 
included in the study. The standard protocol called for these patients to have an IV line placed and to receive 
IV naloxone (1-2 mg) based on the paramedic’s assessment of a possible overdose. However, for this study 
protocol, the patients initially had 2 mg of intranasal naloxone administered using a disposable Mucosal 
Atomiser Device (MAD®). One mL of the 1 mg/mL naloxone solution was administered into each naris (by 
inserting the MAD® approximately ¼ to ½ inch), providing a total volume of 2 mL. Immediately after IN 
naloxone administration, the standard protocol (including airway management, IV line placement and IV 
medications) was followed. The standard protocol was discontinued only if the patient responded and no 
further treatment was required. 
The main outcome measures were: times of initial patient encounter, IN naloxone administration, IV 
insertion, IV naloxone administration, and patient response. In addition, paramedics were asked to report 
any obvious abnormalities noted in the patient’s nasal mucosa (such as bleeding, deformity, mucus, etc.) at 
the time of IN drug administration. The naloxone solution administered in the described study was less 
concentrated than the MR903 formulation and consequently a larger volume was administered than in 
MR903-1501 to achieve a 2 mg dose. It can be assumed, based on both historic published and in house data 
(Dowling et al 2008 and OXN1001), that the solution administered using MAD had a lower absolute 
bioavailability than MR903, and will therefore have resulted in lower plasma naloxone concentrations than 
those recorded for MR903 2 mg. 
Ninety-five patients met the study criteria and thus received IN naloxone. Fifty-two of these patients 
responded to either IN or IV naloxone, with 43 (83%) responding to the IN naloxone alone, before the 
paramedics could administer the IV naloxone. Seven patients (16%) in the IN naloxone response group 
required additional doses of IV naloxone after initial response due to “recurrent somnolence” or “slow

response,” whereas 36 patients (84%) required no further naloxone therapy. In conclusion, this study 
demonstrates the effectiveness of naloxone, and indicates that it delivered an 83% response rate when used 
intranasally. It is reasonable to expect that this response rate might increase for MR903 due to the 
anticipated superior bioavailability of MR903 compared with the MAD-administered product. 
Merlin et al., 2010 
Another study, conducted by Merlin et al. (2010) in the US, proposed that IN naloxone administration is 
preferable to IV naloxone when administered by emergency medical services for opioid overdoses. Merlin et 
al. performed this study using a retrospective chart review of pre-hospital advanced life support patients on 
confirmed opioid overdose patients. The intent of this study was to investigate whether IN naloxone was non-
inferior when compared to IV naloxone in increasing respiratory rates (RR) and mental status in patients 
presenting with suspected opioid overdose in the pre-hospital setting. The primary outcome measures were 
changes in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and unassisted RRs recorded by paramedics after administration of IN 
and IV naloxone. GCS and unassisted RRs were thus used as indicators of naloxone effectiveness. The 
median changes in RR and GCS were determined. Three hundred forty-four patients who received naloxone 
by paramedics from January 1, 2005, until December 31, 2007, were evaluated. Of the confirmed opioid 
overdoses, the change in RR was 6 for the IV group and 4 for the IN group (P = .08). Change in GCS was 4 
for the IV group and 3 for the IN group (P = .19). Correlations between RR and GCS for initial, final, and 
change were significant at the 0.01 level (ρ = 0.577, 0.462, 0.568, respectively).

Merlin et al. (2010) concluded that IN naloxone is as effective as IV naloxone at reversing the central nervous 
system-depressing effects caused by opioids. 
Robertson et al., 2009   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 39/59 
  
  
 
Robertson et al. (2009), conducted a study to compare the IV and IN routes of naloxone administration with 
respect to the time from patient contact and medication administration to clinical effect in patients with 
suspected narcotic overdose. The researchers performed a retrospective review of emergency medical 
services (EMS) and hospital records, before and after implementation of a protocol for administration of 
intranasal naloxone by the Central California EMS Agency. Patients with suspected narcotic overdose treated 
in the pre-hospital setting over 17 months, between March 2003 and July 2004, were included in this study. 
Paramedics documented dose, route of administration, and positive response times using an electronic 
record. Clinical response was defined as an increase in RR (breaths/min) or GCS score of at least 6. Main 
outcome variables included time from medication to clinical response and time from patient contact to clinical 
response. Secondary variables included numbers of doses administered and rescue doses given by an 
alternate route. Between-group comparisons were accomplished using t-tests and chi-square tests as 
appropriate. One hundred fifty-four patients met the inclusion criteria, including 104 treated with IV and 50 
treated with IN naloxone. A clinical response was noted in 33 (66%) and 58 (56%) of the patients in the IN 
and IV groups, respectively (p = 0.3). The mean time between naloxone administration and clinical response 
was longer for the IN group (12.9 vs. 8.1 min, p = 0.02). However, the mean times from patient contact to 
clinical response were not significantly different between the IN and IV groups (20.3 vs. 20.7 min, p = 0.9). 
This is shown in Figure 2. In the IN group, 17/50 patients were given a second dose of naloxone, while in the 
IV group 19/104 required a second dose (34% vs. 18%, p = 0.05), and three patients in the IN group 
received a subsequent dose of IV or IM naloxone. 
Figure 6.  Time intervals in minutes. IN = Intranasal; IV = intravenous 
It was found that although IN naloxone had a slower onset of action than the IV route, the overall time from 
patient contact to clinical effect was the same. Intranasal naloxone represents a more gradual and potentially 
safer way to reverse the effects of opioid overdose. The researchers showed that intranasal naloxone is a 
useful alternative in patients with suspected narcotic overdose in the pre-hospital setting and it potentially 
offers a decreased risk to the EMS providers caring for patients with difficult IV access and a relatively high 
prevalence of blood-borne pathogens. It is important to note that in this study, IN naloxone was administered 
by EMS (EMT) providers. MR903 is intended to be used by anyone who may witness an overdose, such as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 40/59 
  
  
 
peers, friends and family of drug users. As such, it will also be able to be administered in the vital minutes 
immediately following an overdose, before EMS providers can arrive. 
In relation to the post-hoc analysis of rate of naloxone absorption, the data reported by Robertson et al 
provide reassurance that there will be no clinically relevant difference in the onset of efficacy between IN and 
IM administration, especially with an IN formula of the appropriate concentration. The time from patient 
contact to administration of therapy for IM is unlikely to be as long as for IV administration, but is likely to be 
longer than for IN administration. The 5 minute difference reported here in the time from drug administration 
to clinical response was compensated for by the ease of IN administration. It is reasonable to assume that 
the ease of administration of IN would also compensate for the slight difference in the rate of naloxone 
absorption between IN and IM administration. 
Beltz et al, 2006 
Beltz et al (2006) conducted a study in the US to examine the delivery and effect of naloxone in 164 patients. 
Respiratory rate was < 10 breaths/min in 79 (48%). The most frequent initial dose of naloxone was 1mg 
(range 0.2 – 2 mg). Total doses administered ranged from 0.2 to 4 mg. Death occurred in 36 (22%) patients 
at the scene or during transport.A full or partial response to naloxone occurred in a total of 119 patients 
(73%). In terms of adverse reactions, naloxone-associated violence such as agitation/combativeness or 
vomiting, occurred in 25 cases (15%) and emesis was identified in six (4%). No violence occurred in 127 
cases (77%) and it could not be determined whether violence occurred in 12 cases (7%). Average EMT 
arrival time was 5.9 minutes and the average paramedic arrival time was 11.6 minutes in most cases and 
16.1 minutes. To conclude, no serious side effects of naloxone were recognised in this study. Training to 
manage the agitation and combativeness seen in 15% of cases is useful as part of any program training EMTs 
to administer naloxone. However, nasal administration compared with parenteral administration has been 
shown to have a lower incidence of agitation, possibly due to slower absorption (Barton et al, 2005). 
Therefore, it can be seen that simplicity, efficacy and safety, as well as the time factors associated with the 
arrival of EMTs and paramedics, can be improved with significantly earlier delivery of naloxone to patients in 
opioid overdose if EMTs (and others if those likely to witness an overdose could be enabled to deliver 
naloxone to save lives when opioid overdose is suspected, something that an IN naloxone formulation is 
more likely to achieve. 
Sabzghabaee et al, 2014 
Sabzghabaee et al (2014) conducted a randomized clinical trial study in the Department of Poisoning 
Emergencies at Noor and Ali Asghar (PBUH) University Hospital in Iran. This study was designed to compare 
the effects of IN and IV administration of naloxone in patients who had overdosed on opioids. One hundred 
opioid overdose patients were assigned by random allocation software into two study groups (n = 50). Both 
groups received 0.4 mg naloxone: one group IN (diluted down to a 2 ml nasal spray, 1ml per nostril0 and the 
other IV. The primary outcome measure included change in the level of consciousness (measured using a 
descriptive scale and the GCS). The secondary outcomes were time to response, vital signs (blood pressure, 
heart rate and respiratory rate), arterial blood oxygen (O2) saturation before and 5 minutes after naloxone 
administration, side-effects (e.g. agitation) and the duration of hospital stay. Patients who had been 
administered IN naloxone demonstrated significantly higher levels of consciousness than those in the IV 
group using both descriptive and GCS scales (p < 0.001). This can be seen in Table 5. This finding may be 
because of direct transportation of naloxone to the central nervous system across the olfactory mucosa. In 
addition, there was a significant difference in the heart rate between IN and IV groups (p = 0.003). However, 
blood pressure, respiratory rate and arterial O2 saturation were not significantly different between the two

groups after naloxone administration (p = 0.18, p = 0.17, p = 0.32). There was also no significant difference 
in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (p = 0.14). 
Table 9.  Level of consciousness in opioid overdose patients before and after naloxone 
administration 
In conclusion, this study shows that IN naloxone is as effective as IV naloxone in reversing both respiratory 
depression and the depressive effects on the central nervous system caused by opioid overdose. It is 
therefore suggested to use the IN route for administration of naloxone in opioid overdose patients to reverse 
clinical manifestations of overdose, with less severe withdrawal, especially in patients with a history of 
previous addiction. 
Rando and colleagues, 2015 
Rando and colleagues (2015) assessed IN naloxone administration by police first responders in the US. Data 
from 247 individuals were eligible for study inclusion. Opioid overdose deaths increased significantly before 
initiation of the police officer naloxone prescription programme (NPP) with average deaths per quarter of 5.5 
for 2011, 15.3 for 2012, and 16.3 for the first 9 months of 2013. After initiation of the police officer NPP, the 
number of opioid overdose deaths decreased each quarter with an overall average of 13.4. Of the 67 
participants who received naloxone by police officers, 52 (77.6%) survived, and 8 (11.9%) were lost to 
follow-up. In conclusion, this study showed that IN naloxone administration by police first responders is 
associated with decreased death rates of opioid overdose victims. 
Weber and colleagues, 2012 
Weber and colleagues (2012) conducted a study to determine whether nebulised naloxone can be used safely 
and effectively by prehospital providers for patients with suspected opioid overdose. The author performed a 
Assessment report

retrospective analysis of all consecutive cases administered nebulised naloxone from January 1 to June 30, 
2010, by the Chicago Fire Department. All clinical data were entered in real time into a structured EMS 
database and data abstraction was performed in a systematic manner. Included were cases of suspected 
opioid overdose, altered mental status, and respiratory depression; excluded were cases where nebulised 
naloxone was given for opioid-triggered asthma and cases with incomplete outcome data. The primary 
outcome was patient response to nebulised naloxone. Secondary outcomes included need for rescue naloxone 
(IV or IM), need for assisted ventilation, and adverse antidote events. Kappa interrater reliability was 
calculated and study data were analysed using descriptive statistics. 
Out of 129 cases, 105 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 23 (22%) had complete response, 62 (59%) had 
partial response, and 20 (19%) had no response. Eleven cases (10%) received rescue naloxone, no case 
required assisted ventilation, and no adverse events occurred. The kappa score was 0.993. It was concluded 
that nebulised naloxone is a safe and effective needleless alternative for prehospital treatment of suspected 
opioid overdose in patients with spontaneous respirations (Weber et al, 2012).

The applicant has not performed any efficacy trials in the target population. 
Efficacy is discussed based on: 
a)  the  evidence  that  naloxone,  when  administered  IM  by  HCP  is  efficacious  in  reverting  respiratory 
depression (literature and Naloxon® data); 
b)  that a trial on healthy volunteers has shown similar PK parameters between IN and IM administration 
(Applicant data provided); 
c)  that IN administration is similarly effective (albeit no non inferiority or equivalence study has formally 
been performed) to IM or IV administration on opioid users when administered by HCP (literature); 
d)  THN  programs  have  been  effective  in  countries  where  they  have  been  effectively  implemented 
(literature); 
e) 
lay persons and HCP preference to administer naloxone IN rather than  IM (no comprehensive study 
to support this has been provided). 
It is clear that naloxone is an effective mode of reverting opioid respiratory depression, with post marketing 
data available for about 30 years in Europe. Yet, its efficacy has been mainly  demonstrated with the use of 
IM and IV administration by HCP in patients with CNS / respiratory depression either with illicit, accidental or 
clinical use of opioids. 
IN  route  of  administration  of  naloxone  has  been  used  to  treat  opioid  induced  respiratory  depression  with 
success by HCP, although available literature data is of poor quality, not allowing confirming non inferiority as 
compared to IM or IV route. There is insufficient evidence that opioid overdose patients respond similarly to 
IN administration of naloxone as they respond to other route of administration. This lack of evidence is due 
to:  a) small sample sizes; b) differences in the amount of respiratory or CNS recovery magnitude (GCS 15 
vs  12,  smaller  respiratory  rate  (Merlin  et  al.,  2009);  c)  more  frequent  need to  administer  a  second dose  of 
naloxone  (up  to  2  to  4  times  more  frequent  with  IN  administration  than  with  IM  or  IV  administration

(Robertson et al., 2009, Kerr et al., 2009), making it more risky to be left with no more naloxone to revert a 
repeated respiratory depression when the first treatment of naloxone wears off).  
THN  programmes  have  shown  that  lives  have  been  saved  with  the  use  of  IM  naloxone  kits,  to  be 
administered  by  observers  of  respiratory  depressed  patients  who  are  known  users  of  opioids.  These 
programmes are strongly dependent on the education of lay persons to administer the product. 
The Applicant has provided a PK study, which provided data on the Cmax / Tmax, showing that in 
normotensive non opioid treated healthy volunteers 2 mg of IN naloxone is similar in achieving Tmax and 
Cmax as compared to 0,4 mg of IM naloxone. However, no clinical non-inferiority study has been performed 
to prove that the efficacy of the IN route is equivalent to that of the IM route.  
Data has also not been provided to confirm that lay persons can be acquainted with the device and mode of 
administration  of  Nyxoid,  as  compared  to  the  THN  programmes  with  IM  naloxone,  which  results  in  further 
uncertainty over the proper utilisation in the real world setting. 
To address these concerns, the Applicant has agreed to establish a training program for patients and carers 
and to perform a PAES to provide information on real-world use of Nyxoid.  
Dosing  recommendations  cannot  be  extrapolated  between  adults  and  younger  children.  In  addition,  the 
device is not appropriate to be used in small (child) nostrils. Consequently, the indication needs to be limited 
to patients aged 14 years old and over.   
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has provided a set of data with literature evidence of efficacy of IM naloxone in opioid overdose 
with respiratory depression, both when administered by HCP and when administered by lay people who have 
undergone dedicated educational programs. 
The applicant has also provided PK data to support naloxone use of IN as compared to IM route in healthy 
volunteers, and literature data to support the use of IN naloxone administered by HCP in opioid overdose to 
revert respiratory depression. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The Applicant will establish a training program, specifying that the training and supply of educational material 
for patients and carers will be conducted by Health Care Professionals (HCPs) in the health care setting 
relevant for individual countries.  
The Applicant will conduct a PAES to investigate the effectiveness of Nyxoid in the real-life conditions of use.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
This application is supported by safety data from the PK studies and literature review.  No patients have been 
exposed to Nyxoid. 
The safety of intranasal naloxone has been established in a large number of published studies which are 
listed below.

Key studies conducted with IN formulation are summarised below. 
Kelly et al, 2005 
Kelly and colleagues (2005) conducted a prospective, randomised unblinded study comparing 2 mg IM 
naloxone with 2 mg/5 ml IN naloxone given by a mucosal atomiser. A total of 182 patients were enrolled, of 
whom 155 were evaluable. The patients ranged in age from13–57 years (average 28 years) and 72% were 
male. The primary outcome measure was the response time, defined as the time to regain a respiratory rate 
greater than 10 per minute. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with respiratory rate 
greater than 10 per minute at 8 minutes, the proportion of patients with GCS score greater than 11 to 8 
minutes, the proportion requiring rescue naloxone, and the rate of adverse events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 47/59 
  
  
 
 
 
Patients who received IM naloxone responded faster than the IN group with respect to time until respirations 
greater than 10 per minute (mean of 6 minutes [95% Cl, 5-7 min] to response for IM versus mean of 8 
minutes [95% Cl, 7-8 minutes] to response for IN, p = 0.006). Time to Glasgow Coma Scale greater than 11 
was not significantly different. 
There were no major adverse events for either group, but those who received IM naloxone were more likely 
to experience a minor adverse effect of treatment than those who received IN treatment (21% for the IM 
group v 12% for the IN group; P = 0.1818). The difference in agitation/irritation between the groups was 
particularly notable (13% for the IM group v 2% for the IN group; P = 0.0278). Sixty-two of the 84 patients 
allocated to the IN group (74%) did not require additional therapy. Adverse events (described as mild) are 
listed in Table below. 
Table 11.  Adverse Events after Naloxone 2 mg by intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) routes 
Kerr and colleagues, 2009 
In a follow up to the study by Kelly and colleagues (2005), Kerr and colleagues (2009) compared safety and 
effectiveness of a specially prepared concentrated naloxone formulation (2 mg/ml) given via the IN versus IM 
routes in a randomized, controlled, open-label trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who 
responded within 10 minutes of naloxone administration. Response was defined as effective and spontaneous 
respirations at a rate of ≥ 10 per minute and/or GCS ≥ 13. Patients who received a supplementary dose were 
classified automatically as not achieving an adequate response within 10 minutes. This endpoint was chosen 
to be consistent with current ambulance practice guidelines, where secondary naloxone is recommended for 
inadequate response after a 10-minute period. Secondary outcomes included time to adequate response, 
hospitalization, adverse event rate and requirement for ‘rescue’ naloxone due to inadequate primary 
response as judged by the treating paramedics. Adverse events were grouped into three categories including 
drug related (vomiting, nausea, seizure, sweating, tremor, acute pulmonary oedema, increased blood 
pressure, tremulousness, seizures, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, cardiac arrest, agitation and 
paraesthesia), administration-related (nasal obstruction, nasal deformity) and study-related (epistaxis, 
ruptured septum, spitting, coughing, leakage of solution from nasal passages). 
A total of 172 patients were enrolled into the study with suspected of heroin overdose were treated by 
emergency medical personnel: 83 received 1 mg/0.5 ml into each nostril (2 mg total) and 89 patients 
received 2 mg/ml IM naloxone. The median age was 29 years, and 74% were male. Minor adverse events 
were similar between the two groups (IN: 19.3%, IM.: 19.1%; difference 0.2% 95% CI -11.6, 11.9), as were 
hospitalisation rates (IN: 28.9%, IM: 25.8%; difference 3.1% 95% CI -10.3, 16.4). No difference was

observed in agitation and/or violence (IN.: 6.0%, IM: 7.9%), nausea and/or vomiting (IN: 8.4%, IM: 7.9%) 
and headache (IN: 4.8%, IM: 3.3%) after naloxone treatment.  
Krieter and colleagues, 2016 
Krieter and colleagues (2016) compared the pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal naloxone (2 to 8 mg) 
delivered in low volumes (0.1 to 0.2 mL) using an Aptar Unit-Dose device to an approved (0.4 mg) 
intramuscular dose. There were no differences in the safety profile of IN naloxone compared to IM dosing. No 
significant erythema, edema, erosion, or other signs were observed in the nasal cavity prior to or after 
administration of IN naloxone. Few adverse events (AEs) associated with the nasalmucosa were reported; all 
were mild (grade 1), transient, and with no clear relationship to dose. Vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory 
parameters did not reveal any clinically significant changes or evidence of QTcF prolongation after naloxone 
administration. Two additional AEs were reported with IN administration: 1 for nasal pain after the 2-mg dose 
and 1 for headache after the 8-mg dose.

Middleton et al, 2011 
Middleton and colleagues (2011), reported no SAEs during a clinical study in opioid abusers that compared IN 
doses of buprenorphine and naloxone [crushed buprenorphine (2 mg and 8 mg), crushed 
buprenorphine/naloxone (2/0.5 mg and 8/2 mg)] with an IV dose (0.8 mg buprenorphine/0.2 mg naloxone) 
(Middleton et al, 2011). Side effects included constipation, vomiting, and headache. One subject reported 
blurry vision after an active dose. Thus in conclusion, the formulations were safely tolerated with minimum 
effects on oxygen saturation and respiratory rate (Middleton et al, 2011). 
Sabzghabaee et al, 2014 
Sabzghabaee and colleagues (2014) conducted a randomised clinical trial to compare the effects of IN and IV 
administration of naloxone in patients who had overdosed on opioids. The study design focused particularly 
on agitation as a side effect, with 12 patients in the IV group, but no patient in the IN group, observed to 
become agitated after naloxone administration, initially of 0.4 mg naloxone diluted down to a 2 mL nasal 
spray (1 mL into each nostril) or dose of 0.4 mg IV by bolus, with further dose after 5 minutes if patient had 
failed to respond (Sabzghabaee et al, 2014). 
Belz et al, 2006 
In 2006, Belz and colleagues, retrospectively reviewed case reports of 164 patients who received naloxone. 
These included 2 patients who received solely IN naloxone and one patient who received IN and IM naloxone. 
Other routes of administration included solely IM naloxone (18 patients) solely IV naloxone (108 patients) 
Assessment report

and a combination of IM and IV naloxone (29 patients). The total naloxone dose ranged from 0.2 to 4 mg. 
Adverse reactions were limited to agitation/combativeness in 25 patients (15%) and emesis in 6 patients 
(4%). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  an  opioid  overdose,  the  primary  cause  of  a  fatal  outcome  is  respiratory  depression  and  the  resulting 
cardiac  arrest.  There  are  numerous  risk  factors  influencing  the  likelihood  of an  overdose,  including,  but  not 
limited to, the type of opioid, its strength, the amount that is absorbed into the blood and the recipient ADME 
status.  Indeed  individual  factors,  such  as  tolerance,  current  health  status,  duration  of  use  and  genetic 
influences, among others, add to the intricacy and complexity surrounding opioid overdose. 
Widespread use of naloxone allows concluding that it is a generally safe and effective antidote especially for 
the  respiratory-depressant  effects  of  heroin  and  other  opioids.  It  works  best  in  reversing  the  effects  of  a 
heroin  or  morphine  overdose,  but,  depending  on  dose  and  route  of  administration,  it  also  works  to  reverse 
respiratory  depression  caused  by  other  opioids,  including  methadone.  The  short  duration  of  action  of 
naloxone  means  that  repeated  doses  may  be  required  for  full  effectiveness  at  reversing  respiratory 
depression. 
Since the applicant has not provided a single study of intranasal naloxone, but has committed to produce a 
PAES  in  a  real-world  setting  in  EU  MS,  the  study  will  also  produce  safety  data  that  will  mitigate  the lack  of 
information for the use of this formulation in the planned population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  applicant  has  provided  published  literature  data  on  safety  of  naloxone,  administered  via  various  routes 
and in a range of doses.  Given the well-known safety profile of naloxone, the presented evidence has been 
found to be sufficient. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The  Applicant  has  committed  to  conduct  a  PAES  that  will  also  provide  safety  data  in  a  real-world  setting  in 
EU. 
The frequency of PSUR has been agreed to be every 6 months.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the new form of administration, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list 
for Nyxoid is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for naloxone. The requirements for 
submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C 
of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD).  The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Naloxone is a medicinal product which is globally approved for the partial or complete reversal of opioid 
overdose. Injectable naloxone administered by the IV or IM route in doses from 0.4 mg to 2 mg is currently 
the standard treatment for opioid overdose. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Naloxone  became  standard  clinical  practice  in  opioid  overdose  treatment  more  than  three  decades  ago, 
having  been  discovered  in  the  early  1960s  and  then  approved  as  an  opioid  antagonist  for  IV,  IM  and  SC 
administration  in  the  1970s.  The  clinical  efficacy  of  naloxone  in  reversing  opioid  overdose  has  been 
demonstrated  in  numerous  studies  (Belz  et  al.  2006,  Barton  et  al.  2002;  Barton  et  al.  2005;  Merlin  et  al. 
2010; Robinson 2014) by showing a high proportion (82%) of patients achieve successful reversal of opioid 
overdose.  In  2014  the  WHO  strongly  recommended  that  naloxone  should  be  available  to  people  likely  to 
witness opioid overdose (WHO, 2014). In many parts of the world, naloxone is already available for overdose 
treatment in a pre-hospital setting, including the EU, USA, Canada, Australia (EMCDDA, 2014). The first US-
based take-home naloxone programme in Chicago reported 319 overdose reversals between 2001 and 2006 
(Maxwell et al 2006). The author stated that a steady increase in heroin overdose deaths was noticed since 
1991,  with  a  fourfold  increase  between  1996  and  2000.  This  trend  reversed  in  2001  when  take-home 
naloxone programme was initiated, with a 20% decrease in 2001 and 10% decreases in 2002 and 2003. 
As  an  example,  the  distribution  of  naloxone  in  the  UK  for  use  by  non-medically  trained  administers  was 
suggested  as  early  as  1992  as  a  potentially  life-saving  intervention  (Strang  &  Farrell,  1992;  Strang,  1993). 
Several THN schemes have now occurred in the UK. In Wales THN kits are available to all individuals at risk 
of opioid poisoning (Public Health Wales, 2015), and have reportedly been used successfully in 632 overdose 
cases  since  2009.  According  to  data  from  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  published  on  3rd  of  September 
2015, the number of deaths from drug misuse in Wales has decreased by 16% on the previous year, with a 
total  of  113  deaths.  This  continues  a  downward  trend  observed  over  the  last  five  years,  and  since  2008 
deaths  from  drug  misuse  have  decreased  by  30  per  cent.  Bennett  et  al  have  recommended  that  THN 
programmes are rolled out nationwide and have highlighted the value of naloxone in these circumstances as 
reliable, effective and safe (Bennett & Holloway, 2011). The provision of emergency take-home IM naloxone 
kits  in  Scotland  for  just  3  years  has  already  substantially  reduced  deaths  in  the  high  risk  group  of  recently 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 53/59 
  
  
released  ex-prisoners.  In  2012  and  2013,  the  percentage  of  opioid-related  deaths  occurring  four  weeks  of 
prison  release  (5.5%  and  4.7%,  respectively)  was  lower  than  when  compared  to  the  2006-10  Baseline 
Indicator  (9.8%)  (NHS  Scotland,  2014).  A  large-scale  randomised  trial  of  take-home  IM  naloxone  N-ALIVE 
study provided to prisoners on their release in the UK recently completed the pilot phase after recruitment of 
1,685 subjects (Strang, personal communication Aug 2015). The use of naloxone for overdose treatment in a 
pre-hospital  setting  is  now  endorsed  by  UK  clinical  guidelines  (Dept.  of  Health  England  and  devolved 
administrations, 2007). 
In  January  2015,  EMCDDA  published  a  systematic  review  of  the  effectiveness  of  these  THN  programmes 
which combine the distribution of naloxone kits with overdose education and training interventions (EMCDDA, 
2015b).  Relevant  outcomes  were:  overdose-related  knowledge;  naloxone-related  attitudes;  naloxone  use 
during witnessed overdose; naloxone induced adverse events; and overdose deaths. A total of 21 studies (1 
RCT,  3  case-series,  17  pre-post  studies)  were  identified,  included  in  the  analysis  and  evaluated,  using  a 
qualitative synthesis method. Results of the analysis showed that educational and training interventions with 
provision  of  THN  decrease  overdose-related  mortality.  Naloxone  was  used  in  a  median  of  67%  of  overdose 
witnessed (self-reported data of those returning for  naloxone refills), and adverse events beyond naloxone-
induced withdrawal symptoms were rare (≤  13% cases of vomiting, ≤  9% agitation, ≤  1% seizures). 
Increased availability of naloxone take-home antidote has not been shown to encourage people to use opioids 
more  dangerously  (Bazazi  et  al,  2010),  in  fact  providing  take-home  kits  has  been  shown  to  almost  halve 
opioid related deaths from 9.8% in 2006-2010 to 4.7% in 2013 (NHS National Services Scotland, 2014). 
Prenoxad (an IM injection kit) is now approved in the UK for emergency use in a non-medical setting. There 
are,  however,  some  barriers  to  use  of  the  injectable  medication.  Some  people  do  not  feel  comfortable 
performing  an  injection,  or  fear  needle-stick  injuries  in  this  high-risk  patient  population  for  blood-borne 
diseases. (Open Society Public Health Program, Public Health Fact Sheet, 4 Nov 2012) An injectable naloxone 
requires  a  certain  level  of  skill  and  training  in  order  to  ensure  successful  administration  by  non-health  care 
professionals.  An  intranasal  formulation  could  facilitate  an  effective  administration  by  non-health  care 
professionals and could remove possible fear for needle stick injuries. A study among 99 injecting drug users 
in  Melbourne,  Australia  found  that  three  quarters  (74%)  would  prefer  IN  naloxone  to  other  administration 
methods, including IM or IV (Kerr et al., 2008). The higher concentration IM formulation containing 1 mg/mL 
naloxone  is  currently  being  used  in  ambulance  care  with  an  improvised  IN  atomiser  (off-label)  by  some 
medical and trained professionals (NHS Highland, 2012). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
There have been no efficacy or safety trials conducted with intranasal naloxone. Instead, the Applicant 
referred to efficacy of the reference product and published literature. The pivotal bridging bioavailability 
study, MR903-1501 examined three IN dose strengths alongside IM and IV reference treatments, with the 
aim of matching MR903 to the early exposure from the standard of care IM 0.4 mg dose.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  main  benefit  of  naloxone  is  the  reversion of  the  opioid  induced  CNS  /  respiratory depression.  Naloxone 
has been shown to revert respiratory depression when administered via IM, IV or IN route.  
In study MR903-1501 the bioavailability for all the MR903 doses was around 50%, higher than what was 
described in some literature for intranasal administration for different formulations. Cmax and AUC were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690823/2017 
Page 54/59 
  
  
substantially higher (roughly equivalent to a 1 mg IM for the 2 mg IN dose). Early concentrations from 0-6 
minutes are also generally similar between the IM 0.4 mg and IN 2 mg naloxone, thus demonstrating 
sufficient plasma levels of naloxone can be achieved following IN administration.  
The summary of literature has also demonstrated that IN naloxone can be an effective treatment in reversing 
respiratory depression in patients suffering an opioid overdose.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although there is evidence that naloxone IN is a good agent to revert respiratory depression in opioid 
overdose, there is a number of uncertainties regarding the proposed IN formulation: Nyxoid has only be 
studied in healthy subjects. The literature data has limitations and features IN formulations of different 
concentrations. Nevertheless, it suggests that the magnitude of effect on reversal of respiratory depression 
may be slightly lower than the injectable routes with which no clinical non-inferiority study has been 
performed.  In addition, the number of responders to the first administration was lower with IN route and the 
need for a second naloxone administration has been shown to be up to 4x higher for some IN formulations. 
Data has also not been provided to confirm that lay persons can be acquainted with the device and mode of 
administration  of  Nyxoid,  as  compared  to  the  THN  programmes  with  IM  naloxone,  which  results  in  further 
uncertainty over the proper utilisation in the real world setting.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
As observed for the reference medicinal product, the most common adverse drug reaction seen with naloxone 
administration  is  nausea.    Typical  opioid  withdrawal  syndrome  may  be  caused  by  the  abrupt  withdrawal  of 
opioid in persons physically dependent on them.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of naloxone is widely known. A single administration like the proposed indication is devoid 
of long-term or chronic effects. Uncertainties are therefore few. 
The  cultural  and  social  setting  of  illicit  opioid  use  may  lead  to  the  use  of  Nyxoid  as  a  punishing  agent, 
inducing  opioid  withdrawal  syndrome  in  chronic  opioid  users  if  administered  in  non  CNS  depressed  patients 
(e.g.  by  the  illegal  drug  dealers).  To  decrease  this  risk,  this  product  should  be  subject  to  controlled 
distribution. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Favourable  effects  are  clear  for  the  drug  substance.  The  Applicant  has  also  provided  literature  data 
supporting the intranasal administration and a PK study to demonstrate that naloxone plasma levels following 
Nyxoid administration are comparable to standard of care IM injection, hence bridging to efficacy data from 
the reference IM formulation.

Unfavourable effects are of much less magnitude. Adverse event profile of naloxone is well known. The risk of 
illicit use of IN naloxone can be managed by controlled distribution. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Widespread use of naloxone allows concluding that it is a safe and effective antidote for the respiratory-
depressant effects of heroin and other opioids. The short duration of action of naloxone means that repeated 
doses may be required for full effectiveness at reversing respiratory depression. 
Administration of drugs by standard conventional routes (intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous) to 
populations such as injecting drug users carries some risk. Injecting drug users are often infected with blood-
borne viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV), and in 
spite of best practice guidelines designed to minimise needle-stick injury among health workers, needle-stick 
injuries occur, allowing for the possibility of blood-borne virus transmission. Among health care workers, 4% 
of HIV infections and 40% of HBV and HCV infections occur after occupational exposure. The benefits of 
incorporating intranasal naloxone for opioid overdose, include ease of access, rapid reversal of opioid 
overdose in high risk patients with a good overall effectiveness and safety and thus reduced needle-stick 
injury risk and the potential for peer and non-health professional administration. 
The absence of naloxone formulations for non-injectable administration may be limiting its use by laypersons. 
On a clinical level, a layperson who witnesses an overdose may be less likely to intervene and administer an 
injection for fear of needle-stick injury or due to lacking familiarity with needle-and-syringe assembly. 
Therefore, availability of intranasal formulation has potential to address these concerns.  
The ease of administration needs to be balanced by sufficient evidence that it will produce at least the same 
efficacious  response  in  respiratory  depressed  patients  due  to  opioid  overdose  when  administered  by  lay 
people and HCPs. Otherwise, this new product could falsely give the impression that it is at least as good as 
the  alternatives  available in  the  market,  but  require  needle  use.  Most  people are  expected  to  prefer  a non-
invasive procedure when there is evidence that the non-invasive procedure is as good as the invasive one. As 
such  there  might  be  patients  whose  death  would  be  avoided  if  they  had  been  administered  IM  naloxone 
instead of IN naloxone. 
To  address this  uncertainty,  the  Applicant  will  establish  a  training  program,  specifying  that the  training  and 
supply of educational material for patients and carers will be conducted by Health Care Professionals (HCPs) 
in the health care setting relevant for individual countries. Moreover, the effectiveness of Nyxoid in the real-
world setting will be further investigated in a non-interventional Post Authorisation Efficacy Study. This study 
will  also  address  the  safety  concerns  “recurrence  of  respiratory  depression”,  “precipitation  of  opioid 
withdrawal effects” and “lack of efficacy due to incorrect administration” (leading to no or insufficient reversal 
of life-threatening effects of an opioid overdose) as well as collect data on adequateness of training users and 
effectiveness of training/educational material. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nyxoid is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Nyxoid is favourable in the following indication: 
Nyxoid is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy for known or suspected opioid 
overdose as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression in both non-medical and 
healthcare settings. 
Nyxoid is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 14 years and over. 
Nyxoid is not a substitute for emergency medical care. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information

Introduction 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Yttriga  is  a  solution  of  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride,  which  is  a  β-emitting  radionuclide  radio-
pharmaceutical. Yttriga is a radio-pharmaceutical precursor solution for the in vitro radio-labelling of 
pharmaceutical  substances  (specific  carriers),  such  as  monoclonal  antibodies,  peptides  or  other 
chemical vectors for radio-immunotherapy. Yttriga is not be administered directly to patients.  
Nuclear medicine imaging  
In  nuclear  medicines  imaging  of  scintigraphy,  a  source  of  photons  (gamma)  or  positrons  (beta)  is 
attached to a specific compound and injected into the body. External detectors observe the emission of 
such radioactive elements. A typical image corresponds to an orthogonal projection of the density of 
radioactive  elements,  which  is  related  to  the  metabolism  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  in  the  studied 
region (Mazziotta and Gilman 1992). Rotation of the gamma camera around the patient provides a set 
of  projections  that  is  fed  onto  tomographic  algorithms  similar  to  those  used  for  x-ray  computed 
tomography (CT). The result is a 3D volume of data tomoscintigraphy, or single photon emission CT 
(SPECT)  (Lassen  and  Holm  1992).  A  more  complex  strategy  studies  the  emission  of  positrons 
(positive electrons or antielectron): each emitted positron collides with an electron of the environment 
and gives rise to two high-energy photons that go in opposite directions. A ring of detectors set around 
the patient detects these two photons at very near instants. Thus, the associated events lie on a straight 
line  between  these  two  corresponding  detectors.  The  intersection  of  such  lines  gives  rise  to  a  3D 
region  of  emission  from  which  a  3D  image  can  be  reconstructed.  Such  is  the  technique  of  positron 
emission tomography (PET) (Frost J.J. and Wagner H.N. 1990). Both SPECT and PET have relatively 
poor special resolution when compared with CT or MRI (typically a set of 643 or 1283 voxels, each 2 
to 10 mm3, is obtained), but these methods provide functional information that is not available with 
other techniques (DeVita 2001). 
Nuclear medicine therapy 
Nuclear medicine therapy (radio-nuclide therapy) uses radioactive sources for the selective delivery of 
radiation to target organs or tumours. The therapeutic use of radio-isotopes has been developed in the 
mid 20th century, following the discovery of methods of production of artificial radio-nuclides. [131I] 
has been used for the treatment of differentiated papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma and [89Sr] for 
palliation of bone pain from metastatic cancer. Potential new applications of radionuclide therapy in 
oncology  reflect  advances  in  antibody  engineering  (radio-immunotherapy),  the  identification  of 
tumour antigen targets or the synthesis of peptide analogues (peptide therapy). These compounds are 
subsequently  complexed  with  β-  (or  α-)  emitting  radio-nuclides  in  order  to  achieve  an  appropriate 
treatment  through  the  delivery  of  a  cytotoxic  absorbed  radiation  dose  to  the  target  and  prevent  or 
minimise  the  toxicity  for  normal  tissues.  Up  to  now,  two  radio-labelled  anti-CD20  antibodies  have 
emerged  and  been  used  in  the  treatment  of  indolent  B-cell  lymphomas.  In  the  EU,  one  anti-CD20 
radio-immunotherapeutic agent has been approved for the treatment of patients with rituximab-relapse 
or refractory CD20+ follicular B-cell Non Hodgin’s lymphoma  ([90Y] ibritumomab tiuxetan, Zevalin).     
Radio-immunoconjugates 
The  toxic  effects  of  radio-immunotherapy  can  extend  over  several  cell  diameters  from  the  radiation 
source. Most radio-immunoconjugates do not require internalisation to be effective, and the cytotoxic 
effects do not require the presence of an intact, functional immune system. Radio-immunotherapy has 
been  the  most  extensively  studied  immunoconjugate  treatment  strategy  (DeVita  2001).  In  the  past, 
most Radio-immunotherapy studies used iodine 131. Disadvantages of the use of 131I are the unstable 
linkage to the carrier molecule, the weak energy of the therapeutic β- rays, and the emission of γ rays 
resulting in exposure of the environment to unwanted radiation. Improvement in chelation technology

has enabled the study of yttrium 90 conjugates. Yttrium 90 is preferred because of its high-energy β-
emission, leading to a path length of up to 12 mm (mean of 5 mm) in tissues, its lack of volatility, and 
the relative ease and safety of its conjugation to antibodies and subsequent patient administration. This 
long track length enables the irradiation of cells which do not bind or accumulate the radio-labelled 
product.  This  crossfire  effect  is  advantageous  for  therapy  of  larger  tumors,  where  a  homogeneous 
blood  supply  and  therefore  homogeneous  activity  distribution  within  the  tumor  cannot  be  achieved. 
Early studies of Radio-immunotherapy have shown that partial, short lived clinical responses can be 
achieved in some patients with advanced, solid tumors. Hematologic neoplasms are more responsive 
than are solid tumors. Bone marrow suppression is the common dose limiting toxicity. Lymphoma and 
leukemias remain the most sensitive tumor targets, presumably because of the intrinsic sensitivity to 
radiation  and  the  relatively  good  access  of  radio-immunoconjugates  to  the  malignant  cells  that 
comprise  these  neoplasms.  The  centrally  approved  radiopharmaceutical  precursors  solutions 
containing Yttrium [90Y] chloride are Teryttrex and Ytracis.

2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Composition 
The product consists of a sterile solution of Yttrium (90Y) chloride in dilute hydrochloric acid (0.04M) 
to minimise hydrolysis. 1 ml sterile solution contains 0.1-300 GBq Yttrium (90Y) on the reference date 
and  time  corresponding  to  0.005-15  micrograms  of  Yttrium  [90Y]  (as  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride).  The 
theoretical specific activity is 20 GBq/microgram of Yttrium (90Y). 
Each  vial  contains  0.02-5  ml  solution  calibrated  at  a  reference  day/time.  It  is  not  possible  to  state  a 
unique fixed total volume due to the fact that the quantity of the active substance is added to achieve a 
target  activity  per  ml  and  per  vial  and  this  depends  upon  the  specific  activity  of  the  ‘bulk’  active 
substance solution.  
The primary packaging type is usual for radiopharmaceuticals. It consists of a glass vial with a PTFE 
faced  chlorobutylrubber  stopper  or  a  silicon  stopper,  closed  with  an  aluminium  seal.  The  outer 
container is a lead container lined with synthetic material inside.  
Drug Substance 
Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride  is  obtained  by  radioactive  decay  of  strontium-90,  present  as  strontium  [90Sr] 
nitrate.  Yttrium-90  decays  by  emission  of  beta  radiation  with  a  maximum  energy  of  2.28  MeV  to 
stable zirconium-90, with a half-life of 64.1 hours. The decay scheme of 90Sr/90Y is as follows:

• 
Manufacture 
Yttrium [90Y] chloride can be considered as the active substance of this product. It is produced 
by  chemical  separation  from  the  mother  nuclide  [90Sr]  Strontium.  The  strontium  [90Sr]  is  allowed to 
decay to the daughter [90Y]Yttrium. From this mixture, [90Y]Yttrium is separated by extraction and is 
purified  to  remove  trace  quantities  of  [90Sr]Strontium.  The  purified  90Y  material  is  then  used  for 
further processing.   
The main objective of the manufacturing is to produce  90Y of consistent purity with regard to 
radionuclidic  impurities,  metal  impurities,  organic  impurities  &  anionic  impurities.  As  far  as 
radionuclidic  impurities  are  concerned  90Sr  is  the  only  radionuclidic  impurity  present  from  the 
production  process.  The  Sr/Y  ratio  is  ≤  10-5  in  the  Yttrium  (90Y)  chloride  solution.  The  remaining 
radionuclidic  impurities  are  those  coming  from  the  strontium  material  and  are  controlled  by 
appropriate  specifications  for  α-  and  γ-impurities.    Metal  impurities  may  arise  from  reagents, 
production  vessels  or  starting  materials.  These  will  interfere  with  the  radiolabelling  process  by 
competitive  binding  (chelation).  Therefore  it  is  important  to  keep  the  concentration  of  these 
contaminants at a very low level to improve radiolabelling with 90Y.

The chemical stability of the active substance is of limited importance in this case, although the radioactive 
decay characteristics have been defined so as to assign a suitably high concentration and specific activity 
for the bulk solution in order to reach the target for the finished product at the stated reference time.

• 
Hydrochloric acid 0.04 M was chosen as solvent for Yttrium (90Y) based on the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Yttrium  (90Y)  chloride  has  been  produced  in  lab-scale  for  more  than  15  years.  An  large  scale 
extraction  process  has  been  developed.  The  manufacturing  method  is  a  standard  one  consisting  of 
three  simple  steps:  solving,  diluting, and dispensing. The product is sterilised using autoclaving and 
does not contain any microbial preservative.  
Purity aspects of this radiolabelling agent which may have some impact on the clinical performance of 
the radiolabelled product have been identified: 
  Metallic  impurities  may  arise  from  reagents,  production  vessels,  starting  materials.  These  will 
interfere with the radiolabelling process by competitive binding (chelation). Therefore it is important 
to keep the concentration of these contaminants at a very low level to improve radiolabelling with 90Y. 
  Radionuclidic  purity  of  the  product  (=  %  radioactivity  of  the  radionuclide  concerned/total 
radioactivity)  is  also  a  critical  parameter  as  it  may  impact  on  radiotoxicity  (resulting  in  aberrant 
radiation uptake of tissues).  
  Radiochemical  purity  (=  %  radioactivity  of  the  radionuclide  concerned  present  in  the  stated 
chemical form/total radioactivity of that nuclide) and chemical purity are also of influence on product 
performance and are controlled. 
In order to ensure product quality a special test has been developed (DTPA binding) to detect 
any agents preventing 90 Y from being chelated by DTPA like metal ions, chelating organics etc. 
The  choice  of  the  container  is  not  unusual  for  sterile  radioactive  products  and  satisfactory 
specifications have been provided for the container materials.  
Manufacture of the Product 
• 
The drug substance is dissolved in 0.04 M HCl and aliquots are taken to determine the concentration 
of the nuclide in this solution. Depending on that concentration, the required amount of [90Y]Yttrium 
solution is calculated taking into consideration the calibration day/time.  
The calculated amount of solution will be injected in every vial followed directly with an amount of 
non-radioactive  0.04  M  HCl  needed  to  reach  the  required  overall  volume  in  that  vial.  The  vials  are 
then capped and sterilised in an autoclave. After sterilisation each vial is measured for the amount of 
[90Y] Yttrium in an ionisation chamber and visual inspected for visible particles and appearance. 
All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
The  validation  report  from  validation  batches  and  3  production  scale  batches  demonstrates  that  the 
process  is  reproducible  and  provides  a  drug  product  that  complies  with  the  in-process  and  finished 
product specifications. 
Product Specification 
The specification is given below, since the quality aspects must be compared with those required by 
the marketing authorisation holder of any prospective carrier molecule, e.g. monoclonal antibody, in 
order to achieve efficient labelling. (Important quality characteristics of a radiolabelling precursor 
necessary for efficient radiolabelling should be stated in the SPC and package leaflet of the carrier 
product.)

All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Batch analysis data from 3 validation batches and 3 production batches have been presented. All 
batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time 
of batch release. 
Stability of the Product 
• 
For the determination of the product quality at the end of the shelf life different activity levels of 90Y  
(10, 50 and 300 GBq) were filled into the primary packaging (Both glass vials and stoppers intended 
for marketing were used). The parameters tested were activity, DTPA-binding, and 90Sr content. 
Supporting stability data have also been presented from three batches with an activity of 2 GBq (at 
reference time and date) and a fill volume of 0.8 ml. The batches were tested on the production day 
and 2, 5, 9, 12, and 15 days later. 
In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects. 
This is an unusual medicinal product, as it has no specific indication alone and must not be injected 
directly  to  the  patient.  It  is  a  ‘precursor’  to  be  used  for  in  vitro  radiolabelling  of  carrier  molecules, 
which  will  target  a  specific  site  (e.g.  solid  tumour)  to  allow  accumulation  and  local  irradiation. 
However there are defined quality characteristics, which the product meets in order to ensure efficient 
radiolabelling  and  batch-to-batch  consistency.  The  manufacturing  process  is  well  described  and 
controlled and appropriate specifications have been set. Given the short half-life of 90Y stability issues 
are  not  as  crucial  as  with  other  products intended to be stored for longer periods. However stability 
studies have been performed and show that the product remains within the specifications till the end of 
its shelf life.

Pharmacodynamics  
The applicant has presented a review of the available pharmacodynamic data of Yttrium investigated 
in  vivo  (Pavelka,  Meier-Ruge  et  al.  1975;  Kutzner,  Eckmann  et  al.  1985;  Nakamura,  Tsumura-
Hasegawa  et  al.  1991;  Nakamura,  Tsumura-Hasegawa  et  al.  1991;  Hirano,  Kodama  et  al.  1993; 
Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 1993; Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 1997) in the format of literature references.  
Histological studies 
When administered intravenously to rats, 90Y Yttrium citrate showed a high selective accumulation in 
bone. Bone marrow was the critical organ. A significant decrease of leukocytes and thrombocytes was 
observed at doses of 0.5 mCi (17.5 MBq)/kg and 2.0 mCi (74 MBq)/kg. A decrease of erythrocytes 
was  also  observed  at  2.0  mCi  (74  MBq)/kg.  This  dose  being  equivalent  to  a  dose  of  35-140  mCi 
(1.295-5.18 GBq) for a 70 kg human subject (Kutzner, Eckmann et al. 1985). 
When  administered  intravenously  to  rats,  cold  Yttrium  chloride (YCl3) accumulated in the liver, the 
spleen and the bones. A 50 mg/kg dose induced spleen granulomas (Nakamura, Tsumura-Hasegawa et 
al. 1991; Hirano, Kodama et al. 1993). Doses higher than 200 µg induced the formation of a colloidal 
material composed of proteins and some minerals. This colloid was taken up by phagocytic cells in the 
liver  and  the  spleen.  Yttrium  chloride  was  deposited  in  lysosomal  inclusions  of  Kupffer  cells  and 
macrophages, with a half-time of the hepatic clearance of approximately 144 days. At a dose of 1 mg, 
a large amount of calcium was deposited in the liver and the spleen (i.e., more than 10 and 100 times 
the amount of calcium normally present in these organs, respectively) and a slight increase is observed 
in the lung and kidney. 
Biochemical studies 
Yttrium chloride administered intravenously increased the calcium concentration of liver, spleen and 
lung in rats. The distribution of calcium was similar to the distribution of Yttrium chloride in the liver. 
Higher sodium concentrations and lower potassium concentrations were observed in the rats treated. 
Zinc  concentration  in  the  liver  increased  slightly  following  the  Yttrium  chloride  administration.  No 
apparent changes were observed in magnesium and phosphorus (Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 1993). In 
the  same  study  a  slight effect of Yttrium (Y3+) on serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
and  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  following  the  administration  of  10 mg/kg  Yttrium  chloride 
intravenously to rats 24 and 72 hours after the injection was observed. In an other study (Hirano and 
Suzuki  1996)  both  aminotransferases  were  dramatically  increased  following  the  administration  of 
1 mg  of  Yttrium  chloride  intravenously.  The  authors  explained  these  effects  by  the  presence  of 
colloidal form of Yttrium chloride in the blood, which triggers the activity of phagocyte cells in the 
liver  and  the  spleen.  Following  the  administration  of  high  doses  (9-10  mg/kg  and  18-20  mg/kg), 
Yttrium  were  cleared  from  the  blood  within  24  hours.    In  the  liver,  the  percentage  of  the  dose  of 
Yttrium  found  in  the  liver  was  maximal  (71.9  %  ±  2.9)  from  8  hours  to  2  days  and  decreased 
gradually.  Changes  in  Ca  concentrations  in  liver,  spleen,  and  lung  were  in  accordance  with  the 
Yttrium concentration observed (Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 1993). 
The relevance of the observed effects has not been fully interpreted by the authors of the mentioned 
studies. The calcium mobilisation occurred rapidly after Yttrium chloride administration. The Yttrium 
chloride  under  its  colloidal  form  accumulated  preferentially  in  phagocytic  cells  in  the  liver  and  the 
spleen.  The  transitory  increase  of  aspartate  aminotransferase  and  alanine  aminotransferase  and  the 
accumulation  of  calcium  in  the  liver  and  spleen  may  have  indicated  that  these  organs  are  primary 
targets  for  high  doses  of  Yttrium  chloride  administered  intravenously  (approximately  105  times  the 
dose administered for radio-immunotherapy).

•  Safety pharmacology program 
Reference has been provided by the applicant (Stevenson, Daculsi et al. 1982) of one study in which 
the  effect  of  90Sr-  and  90Y-treatment  (2.5,  5,  and  10  µCi/mouse)  on  the  haemopoietic  stem  cell 
compartment and the immune status of mice has been investigated. 
The  kinetics  of  haemopoietic  stem  cells  in  femoral  marrow,  determined  as  colony  forming  units  in 
spleen, CFU-s, were estimated. In all groups, dose-dependant increase in the percentage of CSF were 
observed during the five weeks post-incorporation. Towards the end of the period of observation the 
values remained subnormal. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  information  regarding  interaction  of  Yttrium  chloride  with  other  medicinal  products  has  been  
provided. No animals data have been published. Free Yttrium (Y3+) can complex chelating agents such 
as EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid) which may modify its in vivo behaviour, leading to rapid 
renal elimination. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has presented a review of the published pharmacokinetics of Yttrium, providing data on 
the  absorption  (Deuber  and  Heim  1991),  the  distribution  (Thomassen  and  Leicester  1964;  Barnes, 
McClellan et al. 1972; Deuber and Heim 1991; Hirano, Kodama et al. 1993; Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 
1993;  Horovitz  2000),  the  metabolism  (Kidman,  Tutt  et  al.  1950;  Thomassen  and  Leicester  1964; 
Hirano, Kodama et al. 1990) and the excretion (Barnes, McClellan et al. 1972) of Yttrium. 
The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  Yttrium  depend  on  the  dose  administered  (Nakamura,  Tsumura-
Hasegawa  et  al.  1991).  Several  pharmacokinetic  studies  using  high  doses  of  (cold)  Yttrium  [89] 
chloride or low doses of either radioactive [90Y] or non-radioactive [89Y] Yttrium have been published. 
The  studies  performed  with  low  doses  of  radioactive  Yttrium  chloride  are  the  most  relevant  to 
characterise  the  disposition  of  the  Yttrium  [90Y]  released  after  an  in  vivo  dissociation  of  the  radio-
labelled immunoconjugate.  
Depending  on  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride  serum  concentration,  colloids  of  varying  particle  sizes  are 
formed,  which  may  explain  marked  differences  in  terms  of  biodistribution.  Solutions  of  colloidal 
Yttrium  chloride  over  a  range  of  particle  sizes  prepared  by  varying the citrate/yttrium chloride ratio 
had different biodistribution patterns after intravenous injection in rabbits (Ramsden 1961). The large 
particles  cleared  rapidly  and  distribute  mainly  to  the  liver  and  to  the  spleen.  The  smaller  particles 
cleared  slowly  and  distributed  to  the  bone  and  the  bone  marrow.  The  particles  of  intermediate  size 
concentrated approximately after 18 hours equally in bone and liver. The concentration increased with 
the time in bone and decreased in other organs. Some Yttrium chloride remained at the site of injection 
(the exact particle sizes were not stated).

Single-dose studies 
-  Pharmacokinetics of Yttrium administered at high doses 
A  study  (Nakamura,  Tsumura-Hasegawa  et  al.  1991)  explored  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of 
Yttrium chloride at high doses (10 and 50 mg/kg) administered intravenously to rats. Similar doses of 
some  rare  earth  elements  Europium  (EuCl3),  Dysprosium  (DyCl3)  and  Ytterbium  (YbCl3)  were  also 
given intravenously and the pharmacokinetic properties of these elements were compared to those of 
Yttrium chloride.  
7/27 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At these concentrations, Yttrium chloride accumulates mainly in the liver, the spleen and in the bone. 
The excretion of Yttrium chloride and the rare earth elements occurred gradually in the faeces over a 
period  of  7  days.  No  Yttrium  chloride  or  rare  earth  elements  were  detected  in  the  urine.  A  small 
quantity of Yttrium chloride was found in the kidney, in the pancreas and in the heart.  
Yttrium chloride disappeared from whole blood within 4 hours. In the liver, the distribution was the 
highest  between  8  hours  and  2  days  after  the  administration.  The  fraction  of  the  dose  of  Yttrium 
chloride found in the spleen was higher than for the other rare earth elements and increased over time. 
The distribution of Yttrium chloride in the bone increased gradually.  
Following  an  intravenous  administration  of  10  mg/kg  of  Yttrium  chloride  to  rats,  the  half-life  of 
Yttrium in the blood was 0.427 hours, and 19.3 days in the liver. The concentration of Yttrium in the 
blood and liver decreased exponentially over the time period between 8 hours to 4 days (Nakamura, 
Tsumura et al. 1993).  
The  tissue  distribution  and  the  subcellular  localisation  of  Yttrium  chloride  were  studied  in  rats 
(Hirano,  Kodama  et  al.  1993).  Yttrium  chloride  was  administered  at  different  dosages  ranging  from 
0.1  to  2  mg/rat.  The  animals  were  sacrificed  1h,  14,  28,  91  and  182  days  after  the  injection.  At  1 
mg/rat, the blood Yttrium chloride content decreased rapidly within 3 hours; about 75 % of the dose 
accumulated  in  the  liver  and  20  %  of  the  dose  in  the  spleen  at  7  hours  post  injection.  The 
concentrations of Yttrium chloride in the liver decreased slowly with a half-time of 144 days. At the 
concentrations  tested,  most  of  Yttrium  in  blood  plasma  was  found  in  the  colloids  which  are  rapidly 
cleared and distributed as such in tissues.  
In  all  the  above  mentioned  studies,  Yttrium  injected  at  high  dose  by  intravenous  route  accumulated 
primary  in  the  liver  and  spleen.  A  dose  dependent  colloidal  material  was  observed  in  the  blood, 
composed  of  proteins  and  other  minerals  (calcium,  strontium,  sulphur,  iron,  phosphorus).  This 
colloidal material was subsequently taken up by Kupffer cells and macrophages in the spleen. 
Different  elimination  half-lives  from  the  liver  have  been  published  (Hirano,  Kodama  et  al.  1993; 
Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 1993) and were of 144 and 192 days, respectively. will be determined by 
their conjugation with the ligand and the therapeutic indication(s).  
The  absorption  of  cold  Yttrium  salts  has  been  reported  to  be  0.05%  of  the  dose  taken  up  orally 
(Deuber and Heim 1991). 
-  Pharmacokinetics of Yttrium administered at low doses 
In a study performed by (Durbin 1960) a small amount (the exact dose is not stated in the publication) 
of  Yttrium  [91Y]  chloride,  a  β-emitting  isotope  of  Yttrium  with  a  half-life  equal  to  58.51  days,  was 
administered  intramuscularly  to  rats.  Four  days  after  the  administration  Yttrium  [91Y]  chloride 
distributed mainly in the bones (55.6 % of the initial dose) and in the liver (12.1 % of the initial dose).  
A  study  on  the  distribution  of  Yttrium  [88Y]  (0.5 mCi/mouse)  administrated  intravenously  in  mice 
(Gansow 1991) showed that, at 24, 48 and 168 hours, this isotope of Yttrium mainly accumulated in 
vertebrae, pelvis, femur, kidney and liver. The amount of Yttrium [91Y] in bones was stable between 
24 and 168 hours and was approximately equal to 20% of the injected dose per gram of bone in mice. 
Further  kinetic  studies  indicated  that  Yttrium  [90Y]  quickly  reached  the  femurs  (80%  of  the  dose 
administered), from which the elimination half-time was 62 hours (i.e., close to the emission half-life 
of the isotope Yttrium [90Y] which is equal to 64 hours). The uptake of Yttrium in the femoral marrow 
and muscle was small. Only 2 % and 1 % of the activity of the femoral bone were found in the femoral 
marrow  and  in  the  muscle,  respectively.  The  half-life  of  Yttrium  in  the  lung,  after  intratracheal 
instillation of 100 µg of Yttrium chloride to rats was 168 days (Hirano, Kodama et al. 1990). 
In rabbits and dogs, Yttrium concentrated on bone surfaces (Jowsey, Owen et al. 1955). Yttrium was 
not found in either osteoid tissue or in areas of active calcification. In another study, 24 hours after an 
intraperitoneal  injection  of  500  pCi/kg  of  Yttrium  [91Y]  chloride  to  puppies,  Yttrium  [91Y]  chloride 
accumulated on mineralised bone surfaces, mostly in the epiphyseal bone (Jowsey, Owen et al. 1955). 
Yttrium  was  taken  up  in  the  skeleton  and  appeared  on  non-growing  highly  calcified  bone  surfaces. 
Yttrium was taken up by bone mineral and localised on the available resorbing and inactive surfaces 
of bone tissue.

In a study where rabbits were fed diets containing different amounts of Calcium, diet had no effect on 
the excretion in young animals (Kidman, Tutt et al. 1950). 
In pregnant rats and cattle, Y-compounds did not cross the placental membrane, but were secreted into 
the milk (Luckey and Venugopal 1978).  
The  use  of  disodium  calcium  edetate  (CaNa2EDTA),  to  prevent  or  treat  radio-myelosuppression,  in 
case of Yttrium [90Y] poisoning, has been investigated. In this study (Watanabe, Oriuchi et al. 1999), 
disodium calcium edetate was not able to complex Yttrium [90Y] once fixed on the bones but chelated 
Yttrium [90Y] before its deposition. 
• 
Repeated-doses studies 
In a repeated-dose study (reference not provided by the applicant) Yttrium chloride was given to rats 
in  the  peritoneum  at  60  mg/kg  every  two  days  for  5  months.  The  maximum  level  of  Yttrium  in  the 
femur was 100 times higher than the uptake of strontium given at a similar dose. Zirconium [90] which 
is  produced  by  the  decay  of  Yttrium  [90Y],  is  also  found  in  the  alimentation.  A  standard  diet  is 
estimated  to  provide  3.5  mg  of  zirconium  daily.  Zirconium  concentrates  in  erythrocytes  and  can  be 
detected in several organs such as brain, kidney, liver, lungs, muscles, fatty tissue and lymph nodes. In 
the whole blood zirconium levels are between 0.012 and 1.25 µg/g (Berman and Eleanor 1980). These 
endogenous levels extremely high in comparison with the concentrations resulting from the decay of 
Yttrium [90Y] chloride. The literature data suggest that repeated administrations lead to accumulation 
of Yttrium in the bone. 
• 
Internal radiation dosimetry 
Dosimetry of the labelled radiopharmaceutical depends on the pharmacokinetics of the 
carrier  to  be  labelled.  In  order  to  generate  data  for  the  evaluation  of  the  internal 
radiation  dosimetry  in  humans,  an  evaluation  of  the  internal  radiation  resulting  from 
the free  90Yttrium (90Y+3) that could be administered uncongugated or release from the 
protein conjugates has been submitted.  
Female  Sprague-Dawley  rats  were  administered  a  single  i.v.  dose  of  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride  at  a 
nominal dose level of 15 MBq/kg bodyweight corresponding to 0.75 ng/kg of Y3+. Organs and tissues 
were sampled at 5 minutes, 1, 6, 24, 96 and 360 hours and faeces and urine were collected throughout 
a period of 15 days.  
At the end of the experiment, mean recovery was 23.8% in urine, 6.9% in faeces, 67.4% in organs and 
carcass and 0.2% in rinse water, corresponding to a total recovery of 98.38%. After 1 hour, the highest 
radioactivity was observed in the liver (9.3% of the administered dose/organ), followed by the kidneys 
(2.6%),  femur  (1.1%)  and  bone  marrow  (0.12%).  Only  part  of  the  administered  dose  was  excreted 
within  15  days.  The  highest  recovery  was  observed  in  the  carcass  (56.5%  of  the  administered 
dose/organ),  followed  by  the  skin  (5.1%),  femur  (2.3%),  liver  (1.5%),  kidneys  (0.7%)  and  bone 
marrow  (0.03%).  Due  to  the  short  radioactive  half-life  of  64.1  hours  of  90Yttrium, only 1.4% of the 
administered radioactivity remained in organs 360 hours after administration. The elimination half-life 
of radioactivity from plasma was 24.9 hours. 
The  estimation  of  the  human  internal  radiation  dosimetry  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the 
Medical  Internal  Radiation  Dose  (MIRD)  committee  of  the  Society  of  Nuclear  Medicine  and  the 
International Commission on Radiation Protection recommendations (ICRP).

In a 70-kg adult, the estimated absorbed doses were the highest in the femur, bone marrow, kidneys, 
liver, adrenals, thyroids, spleen and lungs.  
The  estimated  effective  dose  to  the  whole  body  of  a  70-kg  adult  resulting  from  an  intravenously 
injected activity of 1 GBq was 665 mSv.  
Toxicology 
No original single dose or repeated dose toxicity studies were submitted.  
• 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose  intravenous  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  in  rats  (Hirano,  Kodama  et  al.  1993). 
Following the administration 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg, Yttrium was predominantly distributed to plasma 
in  the  blood.  At  doses  superior  to  0.2  mg  Yttrium/rat,  most  plasma  Yttrium  appeared  to  be  in  the 
colloidal material, which was composed of proteins and some minerals. Electron microscopic analyses 
showed that phagocytes in the liver and spleen took up the colloidal material. The Yttrium in the liver 
was  slowly  cleared  with  a  half-life  of  144  days  at  a  dose  of  1  mg  Yttrium/rat  (see  non-clinical 
Pharmacokinetics).  Aspartate  (AST)  and  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  activities  in  plasma  were 
increased  with  a  peak  at  20 hour  after  the  administration  of  1  mg  Yttrium/rat,  and  returned  to  their 
control values at 170 hour after the administration. A slight effect of the administration of Yttrium on 
glutamic-oxaloacetic and glutamic-pyruvate-transaminase serum activities 24 and 72 hours following 
the  administration  to  rats  of  10-mg  Yttrium/kg  intravenously  was  found  (Nakamura,  Tsumura  et  al. 
1993). Yttrium chloride given intravenously to rats increased calcium concentration in the liver, spleen 
and lung; a transitory increase of blood calcium concentration was observed but no changes were seen

in magnesium and phosphorus concentrations (Hirano, Kodama et al. 1993; Nakamura, Tsumura et al. 
1993). At a dose of 1 mg Yttrium/rat (Hirano, Kodama et al. 1993), a significant amount of calcium 
was deposited in the liver (over 10-fold) and spleen (over 100-fold).  
The median lethal dose (LD50) values published for Yttrium in the literature (Deuber and Heim 1991) 
were in the range of 44 to 1710 mg/kg, depending on the administration mode, the animal model and 
the chemical form of the metal.  
The following results were obtained from various sources of the literature (Horovitz 2000):

= Yttrium nitrate; Y2O3= Yttrium oxide.  
Ten days after the administration of 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg of Yttrium in rats and 
mice, an LD50 values of 45 ± 2.1 mg/kg was found in rats and 88 ± 11.7 mg/kg in mice (Kyker and 
Cress 1957).  
The median lethal dose (LD50) for Yttrium and Zirconium after intraperitoneal administration to rats 
ranged from 117 to 395 mg/kg and 63 to 939 mg/kg, respectively (Cochran, Doull et al. 1950). Orally 
administered Zirconium showed LD50 values ranging from 990 to 2290 mg/kg. 
The toxic effects of intraperitoneal injection of 140 mg of Yttrium nitrate in male Sprague-Dawley rats 
exposed  to  gamma  rays  has  been  investigated  (Hartwig,  Leffingwell  et  al.  1958).  Rats  receiving 
intraperitoneal injections of Yttrium nitrate plus whole body exposure to ionizing radiation evidenced 
a  higher  mortality  than  rats  receiving  either  radiation  or  intraperitoneal  injections  of  Yttrium  nitrate 
alone. Subcutaneous injection of Yttrium nitrate caused abscess formation and subsequent epilation.  
The  results  of  a  study  comparing  the  toxicity  of  equivalent  doses  of  Yttrium  chloride,  citrate  and 
edentate  complexes  salts  have  been  published  (Graca,  Davison  et  al.  1962).  Toxic  reactions  were 
observed in mice and guinea pigs with doses from 25mg/kg to 500mg/kg. In general, the citrates were 
more toxic than the edetate complexes, and produced an acute passive congestion of lungs and liver 
within 4 hours after injection. 
Yttrium  oxide  and  Yttrium  nitrate  oral  toxicity  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats  have  been  investigated 
(Lambert 1994). A limit dose of 5.0 g/kg was administered by gavage (50 % w/w solution in distilled 
water) to 10 fasted rats (200 - 300g) using 5 rats of each sex. The animals were observed for 14 days 
after  dosing.  The  single  acute  oral  LD50  of  Yttrium  oxide  was  found  to  be  greater  than  5.0  g/kg. 
However, the single acute oral LD50 of Yttrium nitrate was found to be less than 5.0 g/kg, with 100%

mortality by day 3. Toxic signs prior to death included lethargy, hunched posture, red nasal discharge 
and weight loss. 
• 
Repeat dose toxicity  
A 28 day repeated dose study was conducted in male and female rats which were administered doses 
of  0-1000  mg/kg/day  of  YCl3  6H2O  by  oral  gavage  (Ogawa,  Suzuki  et  al.  1992).  The  number  of 
eosinophilic  leukocytes  increased  in  rats  of  both  sexes  dose-dependently.  At  a  dose  of  1000  mg/kg, 
hyperkeratosis  in  the  forestomach  of  both  sexes  and  eosinophilic  leukocyte  infiltration  in  the 
submucosa  of  the  stomach  of  both  sexes,  erosion  and  dilatation  of  gastric  gland  of  the  glandular 
stomach  in  males,  and  swelling  of  the  glandular  stomach  epithelium  in  females  were  observed.  At 
doses higher than 200 mg/kg, a significant decrease of the serum cholinesterase activity was observed 
in  females.  Yttrium  was  accumulated  mainly  in  the  kidney  but  also  in  femur,  liver  and  spleen,  in  a 
dose-dependent manner.  
The relative chronic toxicity of 42 metal ions (mainly as chlorides), following i.p. injection to mice, 
was investigated by (Bienvenu, Nofre et al. 1963). The LD50 at 30 days was 44.5 ± 0.720 for sodium 
chloride and 0.66 + 0.012 for Yttrium chloride with relative toxicities of 1.0 and 67.4, respectively. 
Intestinal adhesions, but no effect on growth, were observed when Yttrium chloride was administered 
i.p. to rats for 5 months (Bruce, Hietbrink et al. 1963). 
• 
Genotoxocity 
No genotoxocity studies have been performed by the applicant to evaluate the mutagenic potential of 
Yttrium. 
Chromosome  aberration  has  been  observed  in  the  peripheral  blood  lymphocyte  after  intraarticular 
injection  of  Yttrium-90  in  patients  (n  =  20)  treated  for  persistent  synovitis  of  the  knees.  The  net 
increase  in  dicentric  abnormalities  following  the  treatment  was  0.011%  per  mCi  and  the  total  of 
damaged  cells  containing  any  unstable  chromosome  aberrations  was  0.012%  per  mCi  (Lloyd  and 
Reeder 1978). Bacterial mutation assay was performed on Salmonella typhimurium strains and did not 
show  mutagenic  effects  (Horovitz  2000).  The  mutagenic  effects  of  Yttrium  nitrate  was  studies  on 
human and other mammalian somatic cells (Mu C.J. and Shi W.L. 1985). For concentrations between 
2.5 - 266 mg/kg of the salts added to the culture medium of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, no 
differences  from  controls  were  observed.  No  change  in  the  rate  of  chromosomal  aberrations  or  the 
frequency of sister chromatid exchanges were observed. Cytogenetic damage in marrow cells of mice 
was  quantified  at  various  times  up  to  14  days  after  injection  of  90Y-labelled  monoclonal  antibodies. 
Aberrations, predominantly of the chromatid type, were elevated at 24 hours post injection and then 
declined  over  14  days.  Micronuclei  numbers  among  polychromatic  erythrocytes  peaked  3  to  4  days 
after  treatment  and  then  declined  exponentially  but  remained  at  higher  than  the  expected  levels 
(McFee, Robertson et al. 1994). 
Results of other genotoxicity studies have been mentioned (Kaplan et al., 1973; Migalovskaya, 1971; 
Shevchenko, 1970; Brooks and McClellan, 1969). 
• 
Carcinogenicity  
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed by the applicant to evaluate the carcinogenic potential 
of Yttrium. 
Carcinogenic  effects  of  Yttrium  radioisotopes  have  been  observed  in  dogs  (Horovitz  2000).  Beagle 
dogs were exposed to doses of 1.700 to 2.800, 160 to 360, 76 to 270, and 26 to 190 rad per day of 
aerosols  of  90Y  or  91Y,  attached  to  fused  aluminosilicate  particles.  Seven  years  after  exposure  to 
aerosols  of  90Y  or  91Y,  5  dogs  exposed  to  the  90Y  aerosol  and  19  dogs  exposed  to  91Y  developed 
primary  lung  tumours.  Hemangosarcoma  were  observed  with  91YCl3  and  lymphosarcoma  were 
observed with 90Y-FAP (Muggenburg et al., 1986), squamous cell carcinoma of nasal cavity (Boecker

Contradictory publications regarding the carcinogenic effect of Yttrium have been provided (Schröder

Reproductive and developmental studies 
Reproductive functions 
No data are available on the chemical toxicity of Yttrium on the reproductive function. 
Embryo-foetal and perinatal toxicity 
No  teratogenic  effects  were  caused  by  90Y  on  rabbits,  whereas  90Sr  produced  malformations  of  the 
long bones in mice and rats, as well as skeletal tail and eye defects in rats (Kidman, Tutt et al. 1951). 
No  teratogenic  effects  on  rats  and  their  offspring  were  caused  by  a  mixture  of  REE  nitrates  (which 
included Scandium and Yttrium) at concentrations between 16 and 2000 mg/kg (Zong et al., 1992). 
• 
Local tolerance  
No studies have been performed by the applicant to evaluate the local tolerance of Yttrium. 
Data on local tolerance have been published (Lambert 1994; Lambert 1994). Skin irritation test (0.5 g 
applied of Yttrium oxide to one intact and one abraded skin site and occluded for 24 hours) in rabbits 
did not show signs of dermal irritation. Eye irritation test in rabbits demonstrated Yttrium oxide is a 
mildly  irritating  agent  to  the  eye.  From  investigations  performed  in  rats,  Yttrium  nitrate  has  been 
classified as a moderate primary skin irritant and a severe irritating substance to the eye. Subcutaneous 
injection  of  Yttrium  nitrate  caused  abscess  formation  and  subsequent  epilation  and  delayed  wound 
healing in animals. 
No  toxicity  studies  have  been  provided  to  investigate  the antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, 
metabolites, or impurities of Yttrium.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  environmental  risk  assessment  has  been  submitted.  The  report  stated  that  no  environmental  risk 
associated with the solution of radioactive isotope [90Y] Yttrium in 0.04 M HCl is expected, as only 
small volumes are to be handled (> 10 ml) and the medicinal product is to be used in authorised and 
trained institutions only.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  applicant  has  conducted  a  review  of  the  toxico-pharmacological  studies  for  Yttrium  (90Y) 
available  in  the  literature.  The  bibliographical  references  have  been  provided  and  discussed  by  the 
applicant. Consistent results have been shown across studies, and there is sufficient reassurance that 
the  studies  are  reliable,  and  that  the  results  are  of  general  applicability.  By  choosing  not  to  repeat 
certain  animal  studies,  the  applicant  aimed  to  reduce  the  number  of  animals  used  for  experimental 
purposes,  and  to  limit  animal  testing  to  cases  where  there  is  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the result 
will extend the knowledge, with reference to Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986, as 
amended (EU Council 2003), and Council Decision 1999/575/EC (EU Council 23 March 1998). This 
is  in  agreement  with  recital  10,  and  the  general  principles  of  Annex  I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as 
amended (EU Council 2001).  
Pharmacology  
Yttrium  [90Y]  is  a  precursor  to  be  used  for  radio-labelling  purposes  for  combination  with  other 
medicinal  products  consisting  of  a suitable linker (chelator) and a disease-specific carrier. The main 
risk of using Yttrium [90Y] chloride solution is the toxicity of the radiation from 90Y3+ complex due to 
the emission of high-energy β rays. However, Yttrium chloride [90YCl3] is not intended to be directly 
administered  to  the  patients  and  because  of  the  low  systemic  exposure  of  Yttrium  [90Y],  no 
pharmacodynamic  effect  is  sought,  neither  for  the  radionuclide  (unconjugated),  nor  for  the  (cold) 
Yttrium  chloride  itself.  Primary  or  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  are  not  considered  likely  or 
relevant for the application.  
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  data  have  been  submitted.  Considering  the  available 
bibliographic data and considering that 90YCl3 solution will not be injected directly to the patient, the 
absence of additional studies performed by the applicant were considered acceptable and therefore the

requirements  in  terms  of  non-clinical  pharmacology  documentation  as  set  out  in  Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended (EU Council 2001), are considered fulfilled. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A single dose of Yttrium [90Y] chloride injected intravenously was observed in plasma as a colloid and 
was  taken  up  by  the  liver,  the  spleen  and  bones  within  a  few  hours.  When  injected  through 
intramuscular,  intraperitoneal  or  intravenous  route  at  low  dose  in  carrier-free  form,  Yttrium  [90Y] 
chloride  accumulated  mainly  in  bones.  At  low  concentrations,  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride  was  mainly 
adsorbed on the mineral parts of bones and/or is bound by strong electrostatic forces to carbamyl and 
sulphate  groups  of  the  bone  tissue.  There  was  almost  no  biological  clearance  from  bones.  The 
mechanisms of retention are unclear.  
The uptake of Yttrium [90Y] in the muscle and femoral marrow was low. In a study, the total urine and 
faeces elimination was 8 % to 10 % of the injected dose of Yttrium [91Y], after the administration of a 
doses  from  500  to  1000  µCi/kg  to  rabbits  and  dogs  (Jowsey,  Sisson  et  al.  1956).  Pre-injection  of 
chelators  increased  the  elimination  rate  of  Yttrium  [90Y]  in  the  urine.  Since  Yttrium  is  intensively 
fixed on bones when administered at low doses, the bone uptake of Yttrium [90Y] chloride may induce 
secondary myelosuppression. 
Depending on the Yttrium [90Y] chloride serum concentration, colloids of varying particle sizes were 
formed,  which  could  explain  marked  differences  of  biodistribution.  The  different  elimination  half-
lives  observed  from  the  liver  (144  to  192  days)  could  also  be  explained  by  the  differences  between 
injected doses (10 mg and 1 mg), leading to the formation of dose-dependent colloid materials with 
different particle sizes and different elimination patterns. 
The data observed in the literature in animal models are difficult to extrapolate to the extremely low 
dosages  used  in  radionuclide  therapy  in  human.  At  the  concentrations  used  for  radio-labelling 
purposes,  the  amount  of  radio-colloid  formed  as  complex  salts  through  interaction  with  plasma  or 
blood proteins is likely to be extremely low. 
Repeated-dose  data  available  in  the  literature  confirmed  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  Yttrium 
observed from single-dose studies. 
The quantities of Yttrium [90Y] chloride administered during a treatment by radio-immunotherapy are 
such that interference with previous injections are unlikely, except for the radiobiological effects at the 
bone marrow levels which may be cumulative. This risk becomes lower considering that in standard 
radio-immunotherapies, the subsequent doses of Yttrium [90Y] are generally given after the complete 
decay of the previous injection of Yttrium [90Y]. 
Dosimetry  data  on  90Yttrium  have  been  provided  in  the  application  in  order  to  evaluate  the 
contribution  of  non-conjugated  free  90Yttrium  to  the  radiation  dose  following  the  administration  of 
90Yttrium-labelled  medicinal  products,  or  following  accidental  administration  of  the  precursor.  The 
estimation  of  the  human  internal  radiation  dosimetry  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the 
MIRD/ICRP recommendations based on studies using female rats. The use of the MIRD approach was 
considered acceptable. In a 70-kg adult, the estimated absorbed dose was highest in the femur, bone 
marrow, kidneys, liver, adrenals, thyroids, spleen and lungs. The estimated effective dose to the whole 
body of a 70-kg adult resulting from an intravenously injected activity of 1 GBq was 665 mSv.  
The  tissue  distribution  data  obtained  form  this  study  were  in  agreement  with  those  reported  in  the 
literature  with  regard  to  the  impact  of  the  dose  and  the  formation  of  colloids.  The  radiation  dose 
received  by  the  various  organs  following  intravenous  administration  of  an  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled 
medicinal product depends on the specific medicinal product being radio-labelled. It is recommended 
(see  SPC  section  5.4,  Dosimetry)  to  refer  to  the  radiation  dosimetry  of  each  different  medicinal 
product  following  administration  of  the  radio-labelled  preparation,  as  stated  in  the  SPC/PL  of  the 
particular medicinal product to be radio-labelled.

Overall, the knowledge about the pharmacokinetics of Yttrium [90Y] as described in the literature was 
considered sufficient. Apart from the dosimetry study, the applicant did not carry out additional non-
clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  Yttrium.  Additional  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  were 
considered  unlikely  to  add  any  significant  new  knowledge  about  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 
Yttrium,  and  were  therefore  not  required.  Thus,  the  requirements  in  terms  of  pharmacokinetic 
documentation  as  set  out  in  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  (EU  Council  2001),  are  considered 
fulfilled.  
Toxicology 
Conventional  single-dose  studies  with  Yttrium  have  not  been  conducted  by the applicant but results 
from available studies in the literature have been submitted as bibliographical references. Single-dose 
i.v.  distribution  and  toxicology  studies  indicated  that  Yttrium  is  rapidly  cleared  from  plasma  and  is 
mainly deposited in bone mineral. High dose target organ toxicity included the liver and the spleen. 
Each  vial  of  the  medicinal  product  contains  a  maximum  dose  of  300  GBq  Yttrium  [90Y]  with  a 
theoretical  specific  activity  of  20  GBq/µg,  corresponding  to  a  maximum  quantity  of  15  µg  Yttrium 
[90Y] per vial. Since the radioactive precursor is conjugated with the carrier molecule prior to it being 
administered to the patient, the maximum exposure to free Yttrium [90Y] is well below 15 µg Yttrium 
[90Y] (or 0.3 µg/kg in a 50-kg patient). Assuming a standard situation with a radio-incorporation rate 
of 90%, the maximum exposure to 0.03 µg/kg (30 ng/kg) of free Yttrium [90Y] would be present in the 
formulation.  This  is  substantially  lower  than  the  toxic  dose  levels  reported  in  the  literature  where 
LD50-values  reported  were  45  and  88  mg/kg  for  rat  and  mouse  after  intraperitoneal  injection  of 
Yttrium chloride. 
Given the present state of scientific knowledge, and taking into account the low exposure in human to 
Yttrium  and  its  degradation  product,  Zirconium,  resulting  from  the  radioactive  precursor,  additional 
single-dose toxicity studies with Yttrium were not required.  
Conventional  repeated-dose  studies  with  Yttrium  have  not  been  conducted  by  the  applicant.  The 
results from available studies in the literature have been submitted as bibliographical references and 
show  that  Yttrium  is  absorbed  from  the  gastrointestinal  track  and  accumulated  in  the  kidney,  the 
femur,  the  liver  and  the  spleen.  It  was  highly  irritative  to  the  stomach  mucosa  when  administered 
orally. Other studies from the literature, not submitted by the applicant, have investigated the chronic 
(> 5 months) intraperitoneal administration of Yttrium chloride in rabbits and the chronic (8 months) 
intratracheal  administration  of  Yttrium  oxide  to  rats  (Haley  1965).  After  high  doses  of  Yttrium 
administered  to  rats,  granuloma  formation  in  the  spleen  has  been  observed  (Nakamura,  Tsumura-
Hasegawa et al. 1991). Publications on the toxicity of Zirconium (resulting from the decay of Yttrium 
[90Y]) are also available but were not submitted (Berman and Eleanor 1980). Zirconium could lead to 
the immunological response of phagocytic cells in the liver and spleen.  
At  the  recommended  human  dose,  no  systemic  toxicity  linked  to  Yttrium  (as  a  non  radioactive 
product)  is  expected.  Since  Yttrium  [90Y]  will  be  given  at  very  low  concentrations  the  absence  of 
original  repeated  toxicity  studies  in  the  dossier  has  been  accepted.  However,  if  free  radioactive 
Yttrium  [90Y]  is  released,  the  toxicity  will  be  related  to  the  radiobiological  effects  of  Yttrium  [90Y]. 
Moreover,  the  effect  of  Yttrium  colloidal  form  accumulated  in  the  liver  and  spleen,  as  well  as  the 
toxicity of the high doses of stable Zirconium are acknowledge.  
Given the present state of scientific knowledge, and taking into account the information available in 
the literature, additional repeated-dose toxicity studies with Yttrium were not required.  
Conventional  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  conducted  by  the  applicant,  in 
accordance  with  the  requirements of Part III, paragraph 2.2 of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended  (EU  Council  2001).  Adequate  information  have  been  provided  in  section  5.3  (Pre-clinical 
safety  data)  of  the  SPC.  Results  from  studies  available  in  the  literature  have  been  submitted  as 
bibliographical  references.  Although  the  mutagenicity  of  the  metal  is  unknown,  the  mutagenic 
potential  of  90Y3+  relates  to  the  effects  of  radiations.  Exposure  to  ionising  radiation  is  linked  with 
cancer  induction  and  a  potential  for  development  of  hereditary  defects  (see  SPC  section  4.8, 
Undesirable effects). More recent data than those provided by the applicant have been published. 90Y 
citrate  administered  intravenously  in  mice  induced  DNA  damage  in  bone  marrow  erythroblastoid 
cells, that could be measured by subsequent scoring of micronuclei in peripheral blood reticulocytes. 
15/27 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
The administration of 370 and 1,110 kBq to mice (these doses are close to the doses administered in 
humans) induced the formation of 1.33 % and 2.28 % of micronuclei in peripheral blood reticulocytes 
(MnRETs)  2  to  4  days  after  administration  (Lenarczyk,  Goddu  et  al.  2001).  90Y  also  induced 
micronuclei in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (Mill, Wells et al. 1996). In mice, the survival of 
bone  marrow  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-forming  cells  (GM-CFC)  was  reduced  by  intravenous 
administration of 90Y citrate (Goddu, Howell et al. 1998).  
No  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  reproduction  toxicity  of  Yttrium.  No  data  are 
available  on  the  chemical  toxicity  or  the  radio-toxicity  of  yttrium  toward  the  reproductive  function. 
Published data showed that a low fraction of orally administered Zirconium (0.23 g/kg/day in mice) 
was  selectively  fixed  in  the  ovaries,  inducing  hypervascularisation  one  month  after  the  end  of 
treatment (Delongeas, Burnel et al. 1983). This observation is not relevant to the Zirconium resulting 
from  the  decay  of  Yttrium,  which  is  expected  to  be  located  mainly  in  bones.  The  lack  of  data  is 
mentioned  in  the  SPC  (see  section  5.3).  Transfer  of  certain  radioactive  rare  earth  elements  from 
mother to offspring via the placenta or the milk has been shown. 
The  local  tolerance  of  Yttrium  has  not  been  investigated  in  specific  non-clinical  studies.  This  is  in 
agreement  with  the  requirements  of  Part  III,  paragraph  2.2  of  Annex  I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as 
amended (EU Council 2001). 
No  toxicity  studies  have  been  provided  to  investigate  the antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, 
metabolites,  or  impurities  of  Yttrium.  The  isotope  90Y  Yttrium  is  produced  by  separation  from  the 
mother  nuclide  90Sr  by  physico-chemical  separation.  This  is  the  only  isotope  involved  in  the 
production process. The absence of study is in agreement with the requirements of Part III, paragraph 
2.2 of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (EU Council 2001).  
Considering  the  assessment  of  environmental  risks  provided,  the  use  of  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride  is 
associated  with  acceptable  environmental  risks,  provided  that  the  current  regulations  related  to  the 
handling  and  disposal  of  radiopharmaceuticals  are  followed.  Radio-pharmaceuticals  should  be 
received, used and administered, only by authorised persons, in designated clinical settings. Receipt, 
storage,  use,  transfer  and  disposal  are  subject  to  the  regulations  and  appropriate  licences  of  the 
competent authorities. The user should prepare radio-pharmaceuticals in a manner which satisfies both 
radiation  safety  and  pharmaceutical  quality  requirements.  Appropriate  aseptic  precautions  should  be 
taken, and sterility should be maintained throughout the labelling procedures. Appropriate information 
has  been  included  in  section  4.4  (Special  warnings  and  special  precautions  for  use)  and  6.6 
(Instructions for use and handling) of the SPC. 
In  conclusion,  the  knowledge  about  the  pharmacology  and  the  toxicology  of  Yttrium,  based  on 
available  studies  in  the  literature  and  the  documentation  submitted  by  the  applicant,  is  considered 
sufficient. Additional non-clinical toxicology studies are not expected to provide any significant new 
information  about  the  safety  profile  of  Yttrium,  and  are  therefore  not  required.  The  requirements  in 
terms of pharmacology and toxicology documentation as set out in Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended 
(EU Council 2001), are considered fulfilled.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Since  [90Y]Yttrium  is  to  be  exclusively  used  for  the  in  vitro  radio-labelling  of  pharmaceutical 
substances,  such  as  monoclonal  antibodies,  peptides  or  other  substrates  for  radio-nuclide  therapy, 
[90Y]Yttrium  should  not  be  administered  directly  to  patients.  Clinical  information  generated  from 
clinical studies using on the precursor itself is not considered to be relevant in the specific case of a 
radio-pharmaceutical  precursor  intended  solely  for  radio-labelling  purposes,  as  stated  in  Part  III, 
paragraph  2.2  of  Annex  I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  (EU  Council  2001).  Therefore,  no 
original studies on the clinical efficacy of [90Y]Yttrium have been performed by the applicant.  
However,  information  demonstrating  the  clinical  utility  of  the  radio-pharmaceutical  precursor  when 
attached to relevant carrier molecules are required in the Regulation (EU Council 2001). An overview 
of the published experience of 90Y showing therapeutic utility in targeted in vivo radiotherapy has been 
presented. GLP compliance has not been reported in the publications reviewed.

Documentation submitted on clinical utility 
Pharmacology 
Clinical  pharmacology  for  different  Yttrium  [90Y]-labelled  products  published  in  the  literature  have 
been  submitted.  These  publications  referred  to  studies  conducted  with  radio-labelled  antibodies 
(Rosenblum,  Kavanagh  et  al.  1991;  Waldmann,  White  et  al.  1995;  Alcindor  and  Witzig  2002; 
Johnson, Cole et al. 2002), radio-labelled peptides (Leimer, Kurtaran et al. 1998; Paganelli, Grana et 
al. 1999; Valkema, De Jong et al. 2002; Waldherr, Pless et al. 2002; Bushnell, O'Dorisio et al. 2003) 
or  pre-targeted  radio-immunotherapy  (Cremonesi,  Ferrari  et  al.  1999;  Paganelli,  Grana  et  al.  1999; 
Knox, Goris et al. 2000).  
Poor chelation, product gradient or protein or peptide digestion may be responsible for the release of 
unconjugated Yttrium [90Y] in vivo. 
From the clinical experience in the preparation of ibritumomab tiuxetan using a radio-labelling kit, it 
has been shown that, among 402 out of 410 doses prepared, the radiochemical purity was 97.9% + 3.4 
% (Chinn 2000). Clinical release specification was determined by radiochemical purity testing.  
The  amount  of  free  [90Y]  released  after  injection  was  negligible  in  the  case  of  injection  of  [90Y]-
DOTA-biotin,  but  was  5,6  %  ±  2,5  %  of  the  injected  dose  in  the  case  of  injection  of  [90Y]-DTPA-
biotin  (Cremonesi,  Ferrari  et  al.  1999).  The  authors  stated  that  small  fractions  of  free  [90Y]  from 
incomplete radio-labelling could significantly contribute to the red marrow dose (3,26 mGy per MBq 
of free [90Y]).  
Indirect evidence of the uptake of [90Y] by bone was shown in patients with ovarian cancer receiving 
intra-peritoneal [90Y] labelled monoclonal antibody HMFG1 (Stewart, Hird et al. 1990).  
Efficacy 
An  overview  of  the  published  experience  of  90Y,  showing  therapeutic  utility  in  targeted  in  vivo 
radiotherapy,  has  been  presented.  To  date,  one  randomized  phase  III  study,  with  90Y  Zevalin 
(authorised in the EU via the centralized procedure as Zevalin), a 90Y-labelled anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody,  developed  for  the  treatment  of  low-grade  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  has  been 
published.  The  other  presented  studies  using  90Yttrium-labelled  compounds  were  phase  I  studies,  or 
summarized observations of case reports.  
 Zevalin  contains  ibritumomab,  an  IgG1  kappa  immunoglobulin  which  reacts  specifically  with  the 
CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes, targets of its cytotoxicity. 
Ibritumomab  is  conjugated  via  a  linker  to  the  chelating  agent  MX-DTPA  (tiuxetan),  which  securely 
chelates the radioisotope yttrium-90. Tiuxetan is stably bound to the antibody via a covalent, urea type 
bond. Ibritumomab tiuxetan achieves selective targeting CD20+ cells, which are inherently sensitive 
to  radiation.  The  radionucleide  yttrium-90  emits  pure  high-energy  beta  radiation  with  a  local  tissue 
penetration  (5  to  10  mm)  and  effect.  This  regimen  combines  the  antibody-based  tumour  cell  killing 
with rituximab with an antibody based radioimmuno-therapy and thus further tumor-cell killing, but 
with a different mechanism of action (radiation). 
In  a  randomised  controlled  trial,  143  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  low-grade,  follicular,  or 
transformed CD20+ NHL were studied. The treatment with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was preceded by 
two  infusions  of  rituximab,  an  unlabelled  anti-CD20 antibody, to optimise the biodistribution of the 
radiolabelled antibody. After pre-treatment, patients were randomised to treatment with Zevalin (0.4 
mCi/kg, n = 73) versus standard therapy with rituximab (375 mg/m2 i.v. weekly in four doses, n = 70). 
The overall response rate (ORR), primary efficacy endpoint, for the patients in the  90Y ibritumomab 
tiuxetan group was 80% versus 56% in the rituximab group (p = 0.002). Complete response (CR) rates 
were 30% and 16% in the 90Y Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab groups, respectively (P = 
0.04). An additional 4% achieved an unconfirmed CR in each group. Kaplan-Meier estimated median 
duration  of  response  was  14.2  months  in  the  90Y  Yttrium  ibritumomab  tiuxetan  group  versus  12.1 
months  in  the  control  group  (P  =  0.6),  and  time  to  progression  was  11.2  versus  10.1  months  (P  = 
0.173) in all patients. Durable responses of 6 months were 64% vs. 47% (P = 0.030).  
A number of other Yttrium [90Y] labelled monoclonal antibodies or its fragments, for which clinical 
trials  have  been  reported  include,  among  others,  the  monoclonal  antibody  against  leukocyte-DR-
antigen  (DeNardo,  O'Donnell  et  al.  2000),  the  humanised  anti-CD22  monoclonal  antibody

Valkema,  De  Jong  et  al.  2002;  Waldherr,  Pless  et  al.  2002;  Bushnell,  O'Dorisio  et  al.  2003).  From 
these  studies  using  90Y  labelled  peptides,  a  disease  stabilisation  or  partial  response  was  observed  in 
patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumours, who had no other treatment option.  
To  enhance  the  therapeutic  efficacy  of  radio-immunotherapy,  the  tumour  is  pre-targeted  with  an 
antibody  construct  that  has  affinity  for  the  tumour-associated  antigen  on  one  hand  and  for  a  radio-
labelled  hapten  on  the  other.  The  antibody  is  administered  first;  after  clearing  from  circulation,  the 
radio-labelled  hapten  is  injected.  Two  main  approaches  in  this  strategy  can  be  distinguished:  pre-
targeting based on the avid interaction of streptavidin or avidin and biotin, and pre-targeting based on 
the  use  of  bispecific  antibodies.  No  clinical  data  are  published  on  radio-immunotherapy  based  on 
bispecific antibodies using [90Y]Yttrium as label. 
Dosimetry and pharmacokinetics data have been published in cancer patients using a three-step radio-
immunotherapy with Yttrium [90Y] labelled biotin (Cremonesi, Ferrari et al. 1999). Data on a three-
step therapy of high grade gloomy with Yttrium [90Y] labelled biotin were reported (Paganelli, Grana 
et al. 1999).  
Pre-targeting consisting in a murine monoclonal antibody NR-LU-10/streptavidin followed by a single 
dose of biotinylated Yttrium [90Y]-DOTA 72 hours later has been used for treatment of colon cancer 
(Knox, Goris et al. 2000) and adenocarcinomas (Breitz, Weiden et al. 2000). A study has investigated 
the pre-targeted radio-immunotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin`s lymphoma using the anti-CD20 
antibody C2B8 (rituximab) conjugated to [90Y] labelled streptavidin (Weiden, Breitz et al. 2000). The 
reported  results  of  these  studies  suggested  that  higher  activities  than  those  achievable  with 
conventional  radio-immunoconjugates  can  safely  be  administered  using  pre-targeting,  although  the 
results were preliminary. 
Safety  
Published  reports  of  the  clinical  safety  of  different  Yttrium  [90Y]  labelled  products  have  been 
submitted. 
Possible  adverse  events  are  mainly  dependent  on  the  specific  product  to  be  radio-labelled.  Known 
side-effects of free Yttrium [90Y] are an increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stem cell 
damage  (Hnatowich,  Mardirossian  et  al.  1991;  Herpst,  Klein  et  al.  1995;  Cremonesi,  Ferrari  et  al. 
1999;  Kahn,  Austin  et  al.  1999;  Wiseman,  Gordon  et  al.  2002;  Witzig,  Gordon  et  al.  2002). 
Administration of 0.4 mCi/kg of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan lead to a significant yttrium-90 radiation 
dose which was expected to lead to the standard radiation effects particularly on dividing cells. Since 
the  radiation  source  was  bound  to  the  B-cell  antibodies, and therefore to B-cells, the main radiation 
effect  was  expected  to  occur  in  lymphomas,  bone  marrow,  lymphoid  tissues  and  organs  containing 
lymphoid cells. 
The grade of the toxicity was dependent of the injected activity, which has been investigated in dose 
escalating  studies.  In  179  patients  treated  with  Yttrium  [90Y]-ibritumomab,  dosimetry  and 
pharmacokinetics of Yttrium [90Y] did not correlate with toxicity (Wiseman, Leigh et al. 2003). The 
therapeutic administered dose ranged from 7.4 -15 MBq/kg Yttrium [90Y]-ibritumomab. The observed 
toxicity was primarily hematological, transient and reversible. The author concluded that patients with 
19/27 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
adequate bone marrow reserve and less than 25% bone marrow involvement by NHL could be treated 
safely with Yttrium [90Y]-ibritumomab on the basis of a fixed weight adjusted dosing schedule. 
Among  five  patients  with  advanced  somatostatin  receptor  positive  tumours,  who  received  a 
cumulative dose of more than 7400 MBq/m2 of 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe-Tyr-octreotide (DOTATOC),  four 
patients developed renal toxicity; two of these patients showed stable renal insufficiency, two required 
haemodialysis, two exhibited grade 3 anaemia and thrombopenia, grade 2 and 4, respectively  (Otte, 
Herrmann et al. 1999).  
During  pre-targeting  regime  using  90Y-DOTA-biotin,  transient  grade  1/2  non-hematological  toxicity 
was observed (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, elevation of liver function tests, fever, chills, and azotemia). 
Mild and transient hematological toxicity was also observed. Patients who received 30 to 50 mCi/m2 
of 90Y experienced transient grade 3 hematological toxicity. No grade 4 hematological toxicity was 
observed (Weiden, Breitz et al. 2000). 
In a dose escalating trial, most patients (75%) experienced low hematological toxicity (0-2) consisting 
of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia plus neutropenia. At an activity level of 2,96 GBq/m2 more 
than 30% of patients developed grade 4 hematological toxicity (Paganelli, Grana et al. 1999).  
Dosimetry / Overdosage 
The  dosimetry  estimates  have  been  based  on  a  rat  distribution  study  and  the  calculations  have  been 
done  in  accordance  with  MIRD/ICRP  60  recommendations.  Time-points  for  measurements  were  5 
min, 1, 6, 24, 96 and 360 hours. The effective dose to a 70 kg adult resulting from an intravenously 
injected activity of 1 GBq was 665 mSv. 
The contribution of non-conjugated Yttrium (90Y) to the radiation dose following the administration of 
Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  medicinal  product  or  resulting  from  an  accidental  intravenous  injection  of 
Yttriga has been evaluated (see non-clinical pharmacokinetics and discussion on clinical utility). 
Discussion on clinical utility 
Pharmacology 
90Yttrium  chloride,  as  a  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  solution,  is  not  intended  for  direct 
administration to patients but is to be used as precursor to radiolabel targeting agents. These targeting 
agents, e.g. monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates are highly specific to the targeted sites. 
The  biodistribution  of  90Yttrium  is  specific  to  the  carrier  to  be  radio-labelled  and  the  radiation  dose 
received  by  the  organs,  following  intravenous  administration  of  an  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  medicinal 
product  dependents  on  the  specific  radio-labelled  medicinal  product.  Information  on  radiation 
dosimetry of individual medicinal products, following administration of the radio-labelled preparation, 
can be found in the product information of the individual medicinal products to be radio-labelled. 
Unconjugated 90Yttrium may be released in vivo due to poor chelation, product gradient or protein or 
peptide  digestion.  The  radiochemical  purity  was  97.9%  +  3.4%  in  one  published  study  on 
pharmacodynamics  of  free  Yttrium  [90Y]  resulting  from  unstable  binding.  The  expected  unbound 
Yttrium  [90Y]  activity  should  therefore  be less than 3% at the time of injection (impurities were not 
specified). 
The low amounts of free 90Yttrium present in the final product are expected to accumulate primarily in 
the bones, with a small part being retained in the liver and spleen. The radioactivity in the bones may 
also cause irradiation of the bone marrow, which may lead to hematological toxicity. 
In  agreement  with  the  recommendation  of  the  requirements  of  Part III, paragraph 2.2 of Annex I of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (EU Council 2001), the applicant did not carry out specific patient 
pharmacology  studies  on  90Yttrium,  and  an  adequate  description  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  free 
90Yttrium was provided, based on relevant bibliographic data.  
Efficacy 
Since  [90Y]  Yttrium  is  to  be  exclusively  used  for  the  in  vitro  radio-labelling  of  pharmaceutical 
substances,  such  as  monoclonal  antibodies,  peptides  or  other  substrates  for  radio-nuclide  therapy, 
[90Y]Yttrium should not be administered directly to patients. In agreement with the recommendation 
of the requirements of Part III, paragraph 2.2 of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (EU 
20/27 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Council 2001), no original studies on the clinical efficacy of [90Y]Yttrium have been performed by the 
applicant.  
To  date,  one  randomized  phase  III  study,  with  90Y  Zevalin,  a  90Y-labelled  anti-CD20  monoclonal 
antibody  [see  European  Public  Assessment  report  (EPAR)  of  Zevalin  (EMEA  website  2004)], 
developed  for  the  treatment  of  low-grade  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  has  been  authorized, 
supporting  the  clinical  utility  of  the  radionucleide  90Y.  As  required  in  the  Regulation  (EU  Council 
2001),  the  information  provided  were  considered  satisfactory  to  support  the  demonstration  of  the 
clinical utility of the radio-pharmaceutical precursor to be used only for the radio-labelling of carrier 
molecules,  which  have  been  specifically  developed  and  authorised  for  radio-labelling  with  this 
radionuclide (see section 4.1 of the SPC). Yttriga is only to be used by specialists with the appropriate 
experience (see section 4.2 of the SPC).  There is no therapeutic indication of [90Y]Yttrium per se, as a 
precursor, and relevant non-clinical and clinical information relating to the clinical use of the labelled 
product  are  to  be  provided  in  the  dossier  of  the  carrier.  The  quantity  of  Yttriga  required  for 
radiolabelling  and  the  quantity  of  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  medicinal  product  that  is  subsequently 
administered will depend on the medicinal product radio-labelled and its intended use (see section 4.2 
of  the  SPC).  Yttriga  is  intended  for  in  vitro  labelling  of  medicinal  products  which  are  subsequently 
administered  by  the  approved  route  (see  section  4.2  of  the  SPC).  For  information  concerning 
interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products should be obtained  
from the SPC/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radio-labelled (see section 4.5 of the SPC, 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction). 
Safety 
No original studies on the clinical safety of [90Y] Yttrium have been performed by the applicant. This 
was in agreement with the recommendation of the requirements of Part III, paragraph 2.2 of Annex I 
of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended.  In  vivo  presence  of  unconjugated  90Yttrium may be observed 
due  to  poor  chelation,  product  gradient  or  protein  or  peptide  digestion  releasing  unconjugated 
90Yttrium.  An  important  feature  of  the  Yttrium  [90Y]  labelled  medicinal  products  will  be  in  vivo 
stability of the carrier-radiolabel complex and the occurrence of free Yttrium [90Y]. Free Yttrium [90Y] 
is  incorporated  in  a  solid-phase  bone  matrix  and  may  produce,  due  to  the  long  beta  particle  path 
length,  bone  marrow  toxicity.  The  development  of  stable  chelator  linkers  is  therefore  important  for 
medicinal products intended to use Yttrium [90Y] as radiopharmaceutical precursor. 
An  overview  of  the  available  data  on  the  safety  of  [90Y]  Yttrium  form  the  literature  has  been 
presented.  In  the  publications  provided,  bone  marrow  toxicity,  2  to  4  weeks  post-treatment,  was 
transient  (recovery  within  8  to  10  weeks).  Both  in  Hodgkin’s  disease  and  NHL,  haematological 
toxicity  was  best  correlated  with  the  dose  of  [90Y]  Yttrium  (mCi)  90Y  administered  per  kg  of 
bodyweight  as  compared  to  total  dose  (mCi)  or  dose  per  body  surface  (mCi/m2).  Furthermore, 
haematological  toxicity  was  correlated  with  previous  bone  marrow  damage  or  pre-treatment  platelet 
count in Hodgkin’s disease and NHL. As for all the radioactive products, the radiation dose resulting 
from  therapeutic  exposure  may  result  in  higher  incidence  of  cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is 
necessary  to  ensure  that  the  risks  of  the  radiation  are  less  than  from  the  disease  itself.  The  activity 
administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing 
in mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result (see SPC section 4.8, Undesirable effects). 
Possible  side  effects  following  the  intravenous  administration  of  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  a  medicinal 
product prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, will be dependent on the specific medicinal product 
being used, as specified in the SPC of the medicinal product to be radio-labelled. It is recommended 
that  radiopharmaceuticals  should  be  received,  used  and  administered  only  by  authorised  persons  in 
designated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations 
and  appropriate  licences  of  the  competent  authorities  (see  SPC  section  4.4,  Special  warnings  and 
special  precautions  for  use).  As  radiopharmaceuticals,  Yttriga  should  be  prepared  by  the  user  in  a 
manner  which  satisfies  both  radiation  safety  and  pharmaceutical  quality  requirements  and  particular 
care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and adolescents 
(see SPC section 4.4). Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Yttrium 
(90Y)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package 
leaflet of the medicinal product to be radio-labelled (see SPC section 4.7, Effects on ability to drive 
and use machines).

Safety in special populations 
Particular  care  should  be  taken  when  administering  radioactive  medicinal  products  to  children  and 
adolescents  (see  section  4.4  of  the  SPC,  Special  warnings  and  special  precautions  for  use).  Before 
administration  of  a  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  medicinal  product  pregnancy  has  to  be  excluded  (see 
section  4.6,  Pregnancy  and  lactation).  Yttriga  is  contraindicated  in  case  of  established  or  suspected 
pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3 of the SPC, Contraindications).  
In case of pregnancy, alternative techniques which do not involve ionising radiation should always be 
considered. Before administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast feeding, 
consideration  should  be  given  to  whether  the  investigation  could  be  reasonably  delayed  until  the 
mother has ceased breastfeeding. If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be 
advised  to  stop  breastfeeding  (see  SPC  section  4.6).  Yttriga  is  also  contraindicated  in  case  of 
hypersensitivity to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or to any of the excipients. Regarding contraindications or 
information  concerning  the  use  of  a  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  medicinal  in  pregnancy  and  lactation  to 
particular  Yttrium  (90Y)-labelled  medicinal  products  prepared  by  radio-labelling  with  Yttriga,  it  is 
recommended  that  (see  SPC  section  4.3  and  4.6),  information  is  obtained  from  the  SPC/package 
leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radio-labelled. 
• 
Overdosage 
Situation of accidental ingestion or injection of the radioisotopes in human has been considered. From 
the decay of 90Yttrium, stable Zirconium is formed. As the maximum administered amounts of Yttrium 
and Zirconium are expected to be less than 59 ng (assuming a dose to be administered of 0.4 mCi/kg 
with a specific activity of 0.54 mCi/ng  90Yttrium), metal induced toxicity is not expected in the long 
term. However, in case of accidental administration of the total amount of a vial containing 300 GBq 
(approximately  8  Ci)  90Yttrium  administered  i.v.  as  free  90Yttrium,  would  lead  to  serious  health 
concerns  (hematological  ablation)  and  death.  The  applicant  has  however  specified  that  the  maximal 
batch size produced for the medical practice market is 2 GBq (validation batch vials were in the range 
of  1.2-1.6  GBq,  i.e.,  0.060-0.090µg  90Yttrium).  The  accidental  ingestion  or  injection  of  such  a  vial, 
would lead to severe but reversible radiation-induced haematological toxicity (bone marrow toxicity 
and haematopoetic stern cell damage) and would not result in significant metal toxicity.  
Appropriate  information  has  been  included  in  section  4.9  (overdose)  of  the  SPC  for  Yttrium  [90Y] 
chloride  and  should  be  included  in  the  SPC  of  the  carrier  medicinal  products  on  the  drug-drug 
interaction  potential  section  regarding  chelating  agents.  In  case  of  an  inadvertent  administration  of 
Yttriga,  the  radio-toxicity  for  the  patient  must  be  reduced  by  immediate  (i.e.  within  1  hour) 
administration  of  preparations  containing  chelators 
(trisodium  calcium 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or Ca-EDTA (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) in order 
to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. These chelating agents suppress yttrium 
radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the yttrium due to their capacity of forming 
water  soluble  complexes  with  the  chelating  ligands  (DTPA,  EDTA).  In  the  SPC  (section  4.9),  it 
recommended  that  1  g  of  the  chelating  agents  should be  administered by slow intravenous injection 
over 3 - 4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 – 250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline). The chelating 
efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in 
or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does not preclude 
the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous administration 
should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. In any case the blood parameters of the patient have 
to be monitored and the appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the 
blood  marrow.  Preparation  of  Ca-DTPA  and  Ca-EDTA  must  be  available  in  medical  institutions, 
which use Yttriga for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes. The toxicity of the free 
Yttrium (90Y) due to in vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be 
reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.

Quality 
22/27 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall the quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SPC.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Non-clinical  published  data  showed  that  unconjugated  Yttrium  (90Y)  chloride  accumulates  in  bones 
and  radiation-induced  myelosuppression  was  considered  as  the  most  important  toxicity  (and  dose 
limiting  factor)  to  be  observed  in  clinical  situation.  Exposure  to  ionising  radiation  is  linked  with 
cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. Based on available studies in 
the  literature  and  the  clinical  experience  with  radio-pharmaceutical  precursors  for  radio-labelling 
purposes, additional non-clinical toxicology studies were not required to provide any significant new 
information  about  the  safety  profile  of  Yttrium. The essential data derived from pre-clinical studies, 
which pertain to human risk, have been incorporated into the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Clinical utility  
90Yttrium  is  a  radio-pharmaceutical  precursor,  intended  solely  for  radio-labelling  purposes  for 
combination with other medicinal products such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates 
for  radio-nuclide  therapy.  As  a  precursor,  [90Y]Yttrium  is  not  to  be  given  directly  to  patients. 
Published  experience  of  90Y  showed  the  therapeutic  utility  in  targeted  in  vivo  radiotherapy. 
Appropriate  information  to  support  an  indication  as  a  radio-pharmaceutical  precursor  for  radio-
labelling has been provided. Relevant non-clinical and clinical information related to the clinical use 
of  the  carrier  molecules,  which  have  been  specifically  developed  and  authorised  for  radio-labelling 
with this radionuclide, are to be included in the SPC of the carrier molecules. 
Dose-dependent haematological toxicity, mainly related to haematopoietic stem cell damage, was the 
principal  identified  side  effect  of  Yttrium  [90Y].  The  myelotoxicity  is  mainly  due  to direct stem cell 
targeting  by  the  radiopharmaceutical  rather  than  irradiation  coming  from  non-conjugated  Yttrium 
(90Y) accreting into bone. The minor potential contribution of free Yttrium-90 to bone marrow toxicity 
has been considered as unlikely taking into account the development of new stable chelator linkers. 
As for all radioactive products, the radiation dose resulting from the therapeutic exposure may result 
in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. Exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the 
basis of likely clinical benefit. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of 
the product. 
Clinical data are not relevant in support of the authorisation procedure for this precursor. However, 
sufficient appropriate literature reports on Yttrium (90Y) chloride labelled monoclonal antibodies and 
peptides support the use of Yttrium (90Y) chloride labelled molecules in humans. 
Dosimetry has been calculated from a rat study using the MIRD/ICRP 60 recommendations. 
In conclusion Yttriga has a positive benefit/risk ratio to be used only for the radio-labelling of carrier 
molecules,  which  have  been  specifically  developed  and  authorised  for  radio-labelling  with  this 
radionuclide. No additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures will 
be required other than those stated in the SPC/PL recommendations. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk  ratio  of  Yttrium  [90Y]  chloride  [YCl3]  sterile  solution  AEA  Technology,  as  a  radio-
pharmaceutical precursor, not intended for direct use in patients, to be used only for the radio-labelling 
of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed and authorised for radio-labelling with 
this  radionuclide  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing 
authorisation.

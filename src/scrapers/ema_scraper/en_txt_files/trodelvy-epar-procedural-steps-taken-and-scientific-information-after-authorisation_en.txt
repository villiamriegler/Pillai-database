1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

least two additional systemic therapies in the 
advanced setting based on final results from study 
IMMU-132-09 (TROPiCS-02); this is an open-label, 
randomized, multicenter phase 3 study of 
sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) versus treatment 
of physician's choice (TPC) in subjects with hormonal 
receptor-positive (HR+) human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast 
cancer (mBC) who have failed at least two prior 
chemotherapy regimens. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated 
accordingly. Version 3.0 of the RMP is approved. The 
MAH has also taken the opportunity to introduce 
minor modifications to the product information 
related to the QRD Template and SmPC guideline.

Grouped application comprising two type II 
variations as follows: 
- To update section 4.8 of the SmPC based on an 
integrated summary of immunogenicity. 
- To update sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC based 
on data on the impact of concomitant medications 
including UGT1A1 inhibitors/inducers on SN-38

refinement.

received UGT1A1 inhibitors (N=16) or inducers (N=5) while 
being treated with sacituzumab govitecan, free SN-38 
exposures in these patients were comparable to those in 
patients who did not receive UGT1A1 inhibitor or inducer. 
Across clinical studies in patients treated with sacituzumab 
govitecan, 9 (1.1%) of 785 patients developed antibodies 
to sacituzumab govitecan; 6 of these patients (0.8% of all 
patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan) had 
neutralizing antibodies against sacituzumab govitecan.

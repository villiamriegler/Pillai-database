intravenous infusion in children (4 - 16 years old) with epilepsy. 
  Description 
N01274 is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of the levetiracetam intravenous 15-minute infusion in children 4 to 16 year old with 
epilepsy. 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
  Primary objective : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the levetiracetam IV 
15-minute infusion administered every 12 hours, either as adjunctive treatment or 
mono-therapy in children (4 to 16 years old) with epilepsy, either after switching from 
the equivalent levetiracetam oral dose administration or as a new antiepileptic 
treatment.

  Secondary objective: To assess the pharmacokinetic of the levetiracetam IV 
15 minute infusion administered every 12 hours in children (4 to 16 years old) with 
epilepsy. 
•  Study design 
This study was a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, inpatient study who concerned 
subjects from 4 to 16 years old. These subjects were hospitalized either for reasons related to 
seizures which required levetiracetam IV for a short period of time due to uncontrolled seizures, 
either for temporarily inability to take oral Levetiracetam for medical reasons. 
  Screening period: Days 1 to 7 prior to hospitalization. During this period, clinical 
examinations and tests were performed to confirm the subject’s eligibility.  
  Evaluation period: Duration of IV infusion treatment with levetiracetam. This period 
comprised a minimum of 1 complete set of pharmacokinetics sampling over a 
maximum of 4 days while the subject was inpatient and received a levetiracetam IV 
15-minutes infusion every 12 hours. Saliva and plasma samples were taken at 
scheduled time points for Levetiracetam determination. 
  Follow-up period: A final visit was scheduled between 1 to 2 weeks following the final 
levetiracetam IV infusion.   
•  Study population /Sample size 
  Study population: Subject from 4 to 16 years old, suffering from epilepsy (except 
status epilepticus), not pregnant, with a body weight of at least 10 Kg. 
  Sample size: 11 subjects aged ≥4 to <8 years, 12 subjects aged ≥8 to <12 years and 
10 subjects aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 years were enrolled. 
• 
Treatments 
  Description of investigational medicinal product: Levetiracetam injection was 
provided as 500mg/5mL vials (100mg/mL) to be diluted in a 50ml or 100mL polyvinyl 
chloride pouch for a 15-minute IV infusion. 
  Treatments to be administered (Dose): Subjects who were already taking 
levetiracetam oral tablets/oral solution as an antiepileptic drug received an IV dose 
equivalent to their oral dose, always in bid regiment (levetiracetam 1500mg 
administered as a 15-minute IV infusion is bioequivalent to levetiracetam 3x500mg 
oral tablets after a single administration). The first IV infusion was administered 12 
hours after the last oral dose of levetiracetam. Subjects who were not taking 
Levetiracetam oral tablets/oral solution as part of their antiepileptic drug treatment 
prior to entering the study received an IV dose corresponding to their weight:

  Method of assigning subjects to treatment: All subjects received levetiracetam IV 
infusions. Approximately one half of the subjects were exposed to at least 3 
consecutives IV doses. At least one third of the subjects received a high-dose range 
(≥40mg/Kg/day) of levetiracetam IV. 
•  Statistical Methods 
  Data analysis considerations:  
Categorical data were summarized using frequency tables. Percentages were calculated 
using the number of subjects in the relevant population or subgroup, for whom data 
were available for that variable, as the denominator.  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables included n (number of available 
observations), mean, median, standard deviation, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum,

and maximum. For plasma and saliva concentrations, geometric mean and geometric 
coefficient of variation were calculated. 
Adverse events, physical abnormalities, the indication of the medications, medical 
history, and medical procedures were coded according to the latest version (9.0) of the 
medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). Medications were coded 
according to the latest version (2006/Q2) of the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Drug dictionary. 
  Statistical/analytical issues: Analyses and summaries of demographic and safety 
variables were presented by age group categories (≥ 4 to < 8 years, ≥ 8 to < 12 
years, ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 years) 
  Determination of sample size:  
Per FDA request: 
- 
- 
30 subjects who completed the pharmacokinetics assessments were required. 
These subjects should have had a minimum of 4 post-dose pharmacokinetics 
samples over 1 infusion day. 
Approximately one half of the subjects should had been exposed to at least 3 
consecutive IV doses. 
At least one third  of the subjects should had received treatment in high-dose 
range (≥ 40mg/Kg/day) of levetiracetam. 
Evaluable subjects were approximately distributed throughout the age categories. 
  Safety analyses: 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are classified as: led to permanent 
discontinuation of the study drug, severe TEAE, drug-related TEAE, psychiatric 
TEAE, non-serious TEAE. 
The severity of adverse events was reported as mild, moderate or severe. 
The relation to study drug was reported as none, unlikely, possible, probable or 
highly probable.

  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Thirty-tree subjects were enrolled, included in the ITT (intent-to-treat) population, and treated 
(11 subjects aged ≥ 4 to < 8 years, 12 subjects aged ≥ 8 to < 12 years and 10 subjects aged 
≥ 12 to ≤ 16 years). Thirty-two subjects were included in the PK-ITT population (11 subjects 
aged ≥ 4 to < 8 years, 12 subjects aged ≥ 8 to < 12 years and 9 subjects aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 16 
years). All 33 subjects completed the study. 
•  Baseline data 
  Epilepsy characteristics: The majority of the subjects had an unknown etiology for 
epilepsy, experienced partial onset seizures and were hospitalized for reasons related 
to seizures. The mean duration of epilepsy was 5.21 years. 
  General medical and procedure history: The majority of subjects had at least 1 
general medical and procedure history. The most frequently reported system organ 
class (SOC) was surgical and medical procedures, followed by nervous system 
disorders. 
  Prior and concomitant diseases: The majority of the subjects had at least 1 
concomitant disease. The most frequently reported SOC was the nervous system 
disorders, followed by congenital, familial, and genetic disorders and psychiatrics 
disorders. 
  Prior antiepileptic drugs: The majority of the subjects took at least 1 prior 
antiepileptic drug. The most frequently reported prior antiepileptic drug was valproic 
acid. 
  Concomitant antiepileptic drugs: All subjects took at least 1 prior or concomitant 
antiepileptic drug. The most frequently reported concomitant antiepileptic drug was 
Levetiracetam, followed by valproic acid, lamotrigine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine and 
topiramate. 
  Prior and concomitant non antiepileptic drugs: 52% of the subjects took at least 
1 prior or concomitant non antiepileptic drug. The most frequently reported ATC were 
antiinfectives for systemic use and nervous system. The most frequently reported non 
antiepileptic drug by generic name was paracetamol. 
  Treatment compliance: All subjects who completed the study received study drug 
according to the protocol.

No AE related to abnormal haematology findings. 
  Vital sign measurements and physical examination findings: 
Mean values for all vital sign parameters were within normal limits at each measured time 
point. Three subjects had an event of hypotension during the study. 
Most subjects had normal ECG findings at Baseline that remained normal at the last evaluation 
period assessment. Overall, there was 1 subject (3%) who had a shift from normal at baseline 
to abnormal at the last evaluation period assessment. 
  Other observations related to safety: 
There were no significant clinical changes in the psychiatric and mental status of the subjects 
during the trial. 
  Safety conclusions: 
Review of safety data by an independent safety reviewer identified no issues of concern. 
Overall, analyses of safety data showed that the Levetiracetam 15-minute infusion 
administered every 12 hours was well tolerated in children and adolescents with epilepsy. 
•  Clinical pharmacology results 
The observed Levetiracetam plasma and saliva concentrations were in the expected range, and 
the correlation between plasma and saliva concentrations was positive. The regression analysis 
of concentration data showed a statistically significant association between the levetiracetam 
saliva and plasma concentration.

In study N01274, the number of paediatric subjects was equally balanced between the three groups, 
i.e. 4 to 8 years, 8 to 12 years, and 12 to 16 years. All 33 subjects of the ITT population completed the 
study. All subjects took at least 1 prior or concomitant antiepileptic drug. The normal dose of IV 
levetiracetam was 20 mg/kg/day. However, one third of the children received the high dose regimen (≥ 
40 mg/kg/day). In the five clinical studies cited here above, the daily IV doses of levetiracetam were 
generally higher than these doses. In most studies the children received 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, with a 
maximum of 115 mg/kg/day. The duration of these studies was comprised between 1 to 5 days, thus 
fully in keeping with the duration of study N01274 (1 to 4 days). 
The observation of the undesirable effects showed no serious adverse reactions, neither in the 
study reported here, nor in the 8 paediatric studies found in the literature (5 with IV administration – 3 
with oral intake of levetiracetam). In study N01274, there were no more adverse reactions in the high 
dose regimen group (n = 10) than in the low dose group of levetiracetam (n = 23). Even with higher 
doses (50 to 70 mg/kg/day), few adverse effects were reported: irritability, headache, nausea and 
vomiting. No major changes of the haematological parameters and of the clinical chemistry were 
observed (in the studies from the literature). 
In the SmPC of Keppra® IV the therapeutic initial dose in children aged 4 to 11 years and adolescents 
(12 to 17 years) weighing less than 50 kg is 10 mg/kg twice daily. The dose can be increased up to 30 
mg/kg twice daily. The lowest effective dose should be used. These doses recommendations can be 
maintained as the safety of them has been confirmed in the clinical study reported here. Higher doses 
have been safely used in the literature studies. Moreover, younger children have been treated with the 
same doses or with higher ones, without showing any serious adverse effects.  
The observed levetiracetam plasma and saliva concentrations were in the expected range, and the 
correlation between plasma and saliva concentrations was positive. The regression analysis of 
concentration data showed a statistically significant association between the levetiracetam saliva and 
plasma concentration.

Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
  Overall conclusion 
The CHMP concluded that the data analysed in this study and in studies available from the literature 
showed that the recommended doses of IV levetiracetam for children 4 to 12 years are safe and well 
tolerated. 
  Recommendation 
As the doses tested in study N01274 are in line with the already recommended doses in the SmPC of 
IV levetiracetam, the CHMP considered that no changes to the Product Information were required.

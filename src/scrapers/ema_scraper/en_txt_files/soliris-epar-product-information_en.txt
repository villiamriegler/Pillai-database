Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) in adults 
The PNH dosing regimen for adult patients (≥18 years of age) consists of a 4-week initial phase followed 
by a maintenance phase: 
• 
Initial phase: 600 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) 
intravenous infusion every week for the first 4 weeks. 
Maintenance phase: 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) 
intravenous infusion for the fifth week, followed by 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 
45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) intravenous infusion every 14 ± 2 days (see section 5.1). 
• 
atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), refractory generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) and 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) in adults 
The aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD dosing regimen for adult patients (≥18 years of age) consists of 
a 4 week initial phase followed by a maintenance phase: 
• 
Initial phase: 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) 
intravenous infusion every week for the first 4 weeks. 
Maintenance phase: 1,200 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 
minutes) intravenous infusion for the fifth week, followed by 1,200 mg of Soliris administered via a 
25 – 45 minute (35 minutes ± 10 minutes) intravenous infusion every 14 ± 2 days (see section 5.1). 
• 
Refractory gMG 
Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of Soliris treatment. 
Discontinuation of the therapy should be considered in a patient who shows no evidence of therapeutic 
benefit by 12 weeks. 
Paediatric patients in PNH, aHUS, or refractory gMG 
Paediatric PNH, aHUS, or refractory gMG patients with body weight ≥ 40 kg are treated with the adult 
dosing recommendations.   
In paediatric PNH, aHUS, and refractory gMG patients with body weight below 40 kg, the Soliris dosing 
regimen consists of: 
Patient Body 
Weight 
30 to <40 kg 
900 mg at week 3; then 900 mg every 2 weeks

300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 2 weeks 
300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 3 weeks 
Soliris has not been studied in patients with PNH or refractory gMG who weigh less than 40kg. The 
posology of Soliris to be used in paediatric patients with PNH or refractory gMG patients weighing less 
than 40 kg is identical to the weight-based dose recommendation provided for paediatric patients with 
aHUS. Based on the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) data available in patients with aHUS 
and PNH treated with Soliris, this body-weight based dose regimen for paediatric patients is expected to 
result in an efficacy and safety profile similar to that in adults. For patients with refractory gMG weighing 
less than 40 kg this body-weight based dose regimen is also expected to result in an efficacy and safety 
profile similar to that in adults. 
Soliris has not been studied in paediatric patients with NMOSD. 
Supplemental dosing of Soliris is required in the setting of concomitant plasmapheresis (PP), plasma 
exchange (PE), or fresh frozen plasma infusion (PI) as described below:

Treatment monitoring 
aHUS patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (see 
section 4.4 aHUS laboratory monitoring). 
Soliris treatment is recommended to continue for the patient’s lifetime, unless the discontinuation of 
Soliris is clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
Soliris may be administered to patients aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that any 
special precautions are needed when older people are treated – although experience with Soliris in this 
patient population is still limited. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.1). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of Soliris have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Soliris in children with refractory gMG aged less than 6 years old have not been 
established. 
The safety and efficacy of Soliris in children with NMOSD aged less than 18 years old have not been 
established.

Method of administration 
Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Soliris should only be administered via 
intravenous infusion as described below. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
The diluted solution of Soliris should be administered by intravenous infusion over 25 – 45 minutes (35 
minutes ± 10 minutes) in adults and 1-4 hours in paediatric patients under 18 years of age via gravity feed, 
a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. It is not necessary to protect the diluted solution of Soliris from 
light during administration to the patient. 
Patients should be monitored for one hour following infusion. If an adverse event occurs during the 
administration of Soliris, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the 
infusion is slowed, the total infusion time may not exceed two hours in adults and four hours in paediatric 
patients under 18 years of age. 
There is limited safety data supporting home-based infusions, additional precautions in the home setting 
such as availability of emergency treatment of infusion reactions or anaphylaxis are recommended. 
Infusion reactions are described in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 on the SmPC. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to eculizumab, murine proteins or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Soliris therapy must not be initiated in patients (see section 4.4): 
-  with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection 
-  who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive prophylactic 
treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Soliris is not expected to affect the aplastic component of anaemia in patients with PNH. 
Meningococcal Infection 
Due to its mechanism of action, the use of Soliris increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal 
infection (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may occur. To reduce the 
risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris unless the risk 
of delaying Soliris therapy outweighs the risks of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who 
initiate Soliris treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine must 
receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines 
against serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic 
meningococcal serogroups. Vaccine against serogroup B where available is also recommended. Patients 
must receive vaccination according to current national vaccination guidelines for vaccination use.  
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, 
including PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD, may experience increased signs and symptoms of 
their underlying disease, such as haemolysis (PNH), TMA (aHUS), MG exacerbation (refractory gMG) or 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relapse (NMOSD). Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after 
recommended vaccination. 
Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given to 
official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious or fatal meningococcal 
infections have been reported in Soliris-treated patients. Sepsis is a common presentation of 
meningococcal infections in patients treated with Soliris (see section 4.8). All patients should be 
monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and 
treated with appropriate antibiotics if necessary. Patients should be informed of these signs and symptoms 
and steps taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of Soliris 
therapy with patients and provide them with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card (see 
Package Leaflet for a description).  
Other Systemic Infections 
Due to its mechanism of action, Soliris therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active 
systemic infections. Patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with Neisseria and 
encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), 
including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. 
Patients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet to increase their awareness of 
potential serious infections and the signs and symptoms of them. Physicians should advise patients about 
gonorrhoea prevention. 
Infusion Reactions 
Administration of Soliris may result in infusion reactions or immunogenicity that could cause allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). In clinical trials, 1 (0.9%) refractory gMG patient 
experienced an infusion reaction which required discontinuation of Soliris. No PNH, aHUS, refractory 
gMG or NMOSD paediatric patients experienced an infusion reaction which required discontinuation of 
Soliris. Soliris administration should be interrupted in all patients experiencing severe infusion reactions 
and appropriate medical therapy administered. 
Immunogenicity 
Infrequent antibody responses have been detected in Soliris-treated patients across all clinical studies. In 
PNH placebo controlled studies low antibody responses have been reported with a frequency (3.4%) 
similar to that of placebo (4.8%).  
In patients with aHUS treated with Soliris, antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3/100 (3%) by the ECL 
bridging format assay. 1/100 (1%) aHUS patients had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies. 
In a refractory gMG placebo controlled study, none (0/62) of the Soliris treated patients showed antidrug 
antibody response during the 26 week active treatment, whereas in a refractory gMG extension study, a 
total of 3/117 (2.6%) overall were positive for ADAs at any post-baseline visit. Positive ADA results 
appeared to be transient, as positive titers were not observed at subsequent visits, and there were no 
clinical findings in these patients suggestive of an effect of positive ADA titers. 
In a NMOSD placebo controlled study, 2/95 (2.1%) of the Soliris treated patients showed antidrug 
antibody response post-baseline. Both patients were negative for neutralizing antibodies. Positive ADA 
samples were low titer and transient. There has been no observed correlation of antibody development to 
clinical response or adverse events. 
Immunization 
Prior to initiating Soliris therapy, it is recommended that PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG  and NMOSD 
patients initiate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Additionally, all patients 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris unless the 
risk of delaying Soliris therapy outweighs the risks of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who 
initiate Soliris treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine must 
receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines 
against serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic 
meningococcal serogroups. Vaccine against serogroup B where available is also recommended (see 
Meningococcal Infection). 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal 
infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group. 
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, 
including PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD may experience increased signs and symptoms of 
their underlying disease, such as haemolysis (PNH), TMA (aHUS), MG exacerbation (refractory gMG) or 
relapse (NMOSD). Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after 
recommended vaccination. 
Anticoagulant therapy 
Treatment with Soliris should not alter anticoagulant management.  
Immunosuppressant and anticholinesterase therapies 
Refractory gMG 
When immunosuppressant and anticholinesterase therapies are decreased or discontinued, patients should 
be monitored closely for signs of disease exacerbation.  
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
When immunosuppressant therapy is decreased or discontinued, patients should be monitored closely for 
signs and symptoms of potential NMOSD relapse. 
PNH Laboratory Monitoring 
PNH patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of intravascular haemolysis, including serum 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. PNH patients receiving Soliris therapy should be similarly monitored 
for intravascular haemolysis by measuring LDH levels, and may require dose adjustment within the 
recommended 14±2 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to every 12 days).  
aHUS Laboratory Monitoring 
aHUS patients receiving Soliris therapy should be monitored for thrombotic microangiopathy by 
measuring platelet counts, serum LDH and serum creatinine, and may require dose adjustment within the 
recommended 14±2 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to every 12 days). 
Treatment Discontinuation for PNH 
If PNH patients discontinue treatment with Soliris they should be closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis. Serious haemolysis is identified by serum LDH levels 
greater than the pre-treatment level, along with any of the following: greater than 25% absolute decrease 
in PNH clone size (in the absence of dilution due to transfusion) in one week or less; a haemoglobin level 
of <5 g/dL or a decrease of >4 g/dL in one week or less; angina; change in mental status; a 50% increase 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in serum creatinine level; or thrombosis. Monitor any patient who discontinues Soliris for at least 8 weeks 
to detect serious haemolysis and other reactions. 
If serious haemolysis occurs after Soliris discontinuation, consider the following procedures/treatments: 
blood transfusion (packed RBCs), or exchange transfusion if the PNH RBCs are >50% of the total RBCs 
by flow cytometry; anticoagulation; corticosteroids; or reinstitution of Soliris. In PNH clinical studies, 16 
patients discontinued the Soliris treatment regimen. Serious haemolysis was not observed. 
Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications have been observed as early as 4 weeks and up to 127 
weeks following discontinuation of Soliris treatment in some patients. Discontinuation of treatment should 
only be considered if medically justified. 
In aHUS clinical studies, 61 patients (21 paediatric patients) discontinued Soliris treatment with a median 
follow-up period of 24 weeks. Fifteen severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications in 12 
patients were observed following treatment discontinuation, and 2 severe TMA complications occurred in 
an additional 2 patients that received a reduced dosing regimen of Soliris outside of the approved dosing 
regimen (See Section 4.2).  Severe TMA complications occurred in patients regardless of whether they 
had an identified genetic mutation, high risk polymorphism or auto-antibody. Additional serious medical 
complications occurred in these patients including severe worsening of kidney function, disease-related 
hospitalization and progression to end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Despite Soliris re-initiation 
following discontinuation, progression to end stage renal disease occurred in one patient.  
If aHUS patients discontinue treatment with Soliris, they should be monitored closely for signs and 
symptoms of severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications. Monitoring may be insufficient to predict 
or prevent severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications in patients with aHUS after discontinuation 
of Soliris. 
Severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications post discontinuation can be identified by (i)  any two, 
or repeated measurement of any one, of the following: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or more as 
compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during Soliris treatment; an increase in serum 
creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during Soliris treatment; or, an increase in 
serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during Soliris treatment; or (ii) any one of 
the following: a change in mental status or seizures; angina or dyspnoea; or thrombosis. 
If severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications occur after Soliris discontinuation, consider 
reinstitution of Soliris treatment, supportive care with PE/PI, or appropriate organ-specific supportive 
measures including renal support with dialysis, respiratory support with mechanical ventilation or 
anticoagulation.   
Treatment discontinuation for refractory gMG:  
Use of Soliris in refractory gMG treatment has been studied only in the setting of chronic administration. 
Patients who discontinue Soliris treatment should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of 
disease exacerbation. 
Treatment discontinuation for NMOSD: 
Use of Soliris in NMOSD treatment has been studied only in the setting of chronic administration and the 
effect of Soliris discontinuation has not been characterized. Patients who discontinue Soliris treatment 
should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of potential NMOSD relapse. 
Educational materials

All physicians who intend to prescribe Soliris must ensure they are familiar with the physician’s guide to 
prescribing. Physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of Soliris therapy with patients and provide 
them with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card.  
Patients should be instructed that if they develop fever, headache accompanied with fever and/or stiff neck 
or sensitivity to light, they should immediately seek medical care as these signs may be indicative of 
meningococcal infection. 
Sodium content 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicinal product contains 
0.88 g sodium per 240 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 44.0% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 0.67 g sodium per 240 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 33.5% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of eculizumab on 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, eculizumab may reduce the expected pharmacodynamic 
effects of rituximab. 
Plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP), fresh frozen plasma infusion (PI) and intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to reduce eculizumab serum levels. A supplemental dose of 
eculizumab is required in these settings. See Section 4.2 for guidance in case of concomitant PE, PP, PI, or 
IVIg treatment.  
Concomitant use of eculizumab with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may reduce effectiveness of 
eculizumab. Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of eculizumab. 
Concomitant use of eculizumab with neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blockers may lower systemic exposures 
and reduce effectiveness of eculizumab. Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of eculizumab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
The use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and for at least 5 months after the last dose of 
treatment with eculizumab should be considered for women of childbearing potential. 
Pregnancy 
There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with eculizumab. Data on a limited 
number of pregnancies exposed to eculizumab (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate there is no 
increased  risk of foetal malformation or foetal-neonatal toxicity. However, due to the lack of well-
controlled studies, uncertainties remain. Therefore, an individual risk benefit analysis is recommended 
before starting and during treatment with eculizumab in pregnant women. Should such a treatment be 
considered necessary during pregnancy, a close maternal and foetal monitoring according to local 
guidelines is recommended. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab (see section 5.3).  
Human IgG are known to cross the human placental barrier, and thus eculizumab may potentially cause 
terminal complement inhibition in the foetal circulation. Therefore, Soliris should be given to a pregnant 
woman only if clearly needed.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed newborn / infant are anticipated as limited data available suggest that 
eculizumab is not excreted in human breast milk. However, due to the limitations of the available data, the 
developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical 
need for eculizumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from eculizumab or from the 
underlying maternal condition. 
Fertility 
No specific study of eculizumab on fertility has been conducted. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Soliris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Supportive safety data were obtained from 33 clinical studies that included 1,555 patients exposed to 
eculizumab in complement-mediated disease populations, including PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and 
NMOSD. The most common adverse reaction was headache, (occurred mostly in the initial phase of 
dosing), and the most serious adverse reaction was meningococcal infection. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in eculizumab completed 
clinical trials, including PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD studies. Adverse reactions reported at 
a very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100) or rare (≥1/10 
000 to <1/1 000) frequency with eculizumab, are listed by system organ class and preferred term. Within 
each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

cADRs identified in postmarketing reports 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In all clinical studies, the most serious adverse reaction was meningococcal sepsis which is a common 
presentation of meningococcal infections in patients treated with Soliris (see section 4.4).  
Other cases of Neisseria species have been reported including sepsis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 
Neisseria sicca/subflava, Neisseria spp unspecified. 
Antibodies to Soliris were detected in 2% of patients with PNH using an ELISA assay, 3% of patients 
with aHUS and 2% of patients with NMOSD using the ECL bridging format assay. In refractory gMG 
placebo-controlled studies, no antidrug antibodies were observed. As with all proteins there is a potential 
for immunogenicity. 
Cases of haemolysis have been reported in the setting of missed or delayed Soliris dose in PNH clinical 
trials (see also Section 4.4). 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy complication have been reported in the setting of missed or delayed 
Soliris dose in aHUS clinical trials (see also Section 4.4).

Paediatric population  
In children and adolescent PNH patients (aged 11 years to less than 18 years) included in the paediatric 
PNH Study M07-005, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult PNH patients. The most 
common adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was headache.  
In paediatric aHUS patients (aged 2 months to less than 18 years) included in the aHUS studies C08-002, 
C08-003, C09-001r and C10-003, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult aHUS 
patients. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age appear similar. 
In paediatric patients with refractory gMG (aged 12 to less than 18 years) included in 
Study ECU-MG-303, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult patients with refractory 
gMG. 
Soliris has not been studied in paediatric patients with NMOSD. 
Elderly population 
No overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger refractory gMG 
patients (< 65 years) (see section 5.1).  
Patients with other diseases 
Safety Data from Other Clinical Studies  
Supportive safety data were obtained in 12 completed clinical studies that included 934 patients exposed 
to eculizumab in other disease populations other than PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG or NMOSD. There 
was an un-vaccinated patient diagnosed with idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy who 
experienced meningococcal meningitis. Adverse reactions reported in patients with disease other than 
PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG or NMOSD were similar to those reported in patients with PNH, aHUS, 
refractory gMG or NMOSD (see Table 1 above). No specific adverse reactions have emerged from these 
clinical studies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AJ01 
Soliris is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG2/4k antibody that binds to the human C5 complement 
protein and inhibits the activation of terminal complement. The Soliris antibody contains human constant 
regions and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted onto the human framework light- and 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
heavy-chain variable regions. Soliris is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino 
acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa. 
Soliris is produced in a murine myeloma (NS0 cell line) expression system and purified by affinity and ion 
exchange chromatography. The bulk drug substance manufacturing process also includes specific viral 
inactivation and removal steps. 
Mechanism of action 
Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to 
the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and 
preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab preserves the early 
components of complement activation that are essential for opsonization of microorganisms and clearance 
of immune complexes. 
In PNH patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated 
intravascular haemolysis are blocked with Soliris treatment.   
In most PNH patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of approximately 35 microgram/mL are sufficient 
for essentially complete inhibition of terminal complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis. 
In PNH, chronic administration of Soliris resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in complement-
mediated haemolytic activity.   
In aHUS patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated 
thrombotic microangiopathy are blocked with Soliris treatment.   
All patients treated with Soliris when administered as recommended demonstrated rapid and sustained 
reduction in terminal complement activity. In all aHUS patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of 
approximately 50 - 100 microgram/mL are sufficient for essentially complete inhibition of terminal 
complement activity.  
In aHUS, chronic administration of Soliris resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in complement-
mediated thrombotic microangiopathy. 
In refractory gMG patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation causes membrane attack 
complex (MAC) dependent lysis and C5a-dependent inflammation at the Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ) 
leading to failure of neuromuscular transmission. Chronic administration of Soliris results in immediate, 
complete, and sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity (eculizumab serum concentrations ≥ 
116 microgram/ml). 
In patients with NMOSD, uncontrolled terminal complement activation caused by autoantibodies against 
AQP4 leads to the formation of the MAC and C5a-dependent inflammation which results in astrocyte 
necrosis and increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, as well as death of the surrounding 
oligodendrocytes and neurons. Chronic administration of Soliris results in immediate, complete, and 
sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity (eculizumab serum concentrations ≥ 116 
microgram/ml). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
The safety and efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with haemolysis were assessed in a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (C04-001).  PNH patients were also treated with Soliris in 
a single arm 52 week study (C04-002), and in a long term extension study (E05-001). Patients received 
meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab was 600 mg 
every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 – 45 minutes (35 minutes ± 10 
minutes). An observational non-interventional Registry in patients with PNH (M07-001) was also initiated 
to characterize the natural history of PNH in untreated patients and the clinical outcomes during Soliris 
treatment. 
In study C04-001 (TRIUMPH) PNH patients with at least 4 transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow 
cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were 
randomized to either Soliris (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an 
initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the haemoglobin 
concentration (the "set-point") which would define each patient’s haemoglobin stabilization and 
transfusion outcomes. The haemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with 
symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Primary efficacy endpoints 
were haemoglobin stabilization (patients who maintained a haemoglobin concentration above the 
haemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week period) and blood 
transfusion requirement. Fatigue and health-related quality of life were relevant secondary endpoints. 
Haemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH 
RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at 
baseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced (see Table 2).  
In the non-controlled study C04-002 (SHEPHERD), PNH patients with at least one transfusion in the prior 
24 months and at least 30,000 platelets/microliter received Soliris over a 52-week period. Concomitant 
medications included anti-thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of 
the patients.  Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 2.

In TRIUMPH, study patients treated with Soliris had significantly reduced (p< 0.001) haemolysis 
resulting in improvements in anaemia as indicated by increased haemoglobin stabilization and reduced 
need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 3). These effects were seen 
among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; 
> 25 units). After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related 
quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of Soliris on thrombotic events 
could not be determined. In SHEPHERD study, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one 
patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum

* Results from study C04-002 refer to pre- versus post-treatment comparisons. 
From the 195 patients that originated in C04-001, C04-002 and other initial studies, Soliris-treated PNH 
patients were enrolled in a long term extension study (E05-001). All patients sustained a reduction in 
intravascular haemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were 
fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. 
However, this finding was shown in non-controlled clinical trials. 
The PNH registry (M07-001) was used to evaluate the efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with no history 
of RBC transfusion. These patients had high disease activity as defined by elevated haemolysis (LDH 
≥1.5x ULN) and the presence of  related clinical symptom(s): fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, 
shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia (haemoglobin <100 g/L), major adverse vascular event (including 
thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction.  
In the PNH Registry, patients treated with Soliris were observed to have a reduction in haemolysis and 
associated symptoms. At 6 months, patients treated with Soliris with no history of RBC transfusion had 
significantly (p<0.001) reduced LDH levels (median LDH of 305 U/L; Table 4). Furthermore, 74% of the 
patients without a history of transfusion and treated with Soliris experienced clinically meaningful 
improvements in FACIT-Fatigue score (i.e., increase by 4 points or more) and 84% in EORTC fatigue 
score (i.e., decrease by 10 points or more).

Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
Data from 100 patients in four prospective controlled studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (C08-
002A/B  C08-003A/B, C10-004) one in paediatric and adolescent patients (C10-003 ) and 30 patients in 
one retrospective study (C09-001r) were used to evaluate the efficacy of Soliris in the treatment of aHUS. 
Study C08-002A/B was a prospective, controlled, open-label study which accrued patients in the early 
phase of aHUS with evidence of clinical thrombotic microangiopathy manifestations with platelet count ≤ 
150 x 109/L despite PE/PI, and LDH and serum creatinine above upper limits of normal. 
Study C08-003A/B was a prospective, controlled, open-label study which accrued patients with longer 
term aHUS without apparent evidence of clinical thrombotic microangiopathy manifestations and 
receiving chronic PE/PI (≥1 PE/PI treatment every two weeks and no more than 3 PE/PI treatments/week 
for at least 8 weeks before the first dose). Patients in both prospective studies were treated with Soliris for 
26 weeks and most patients enrolled into a long-term, open-label extension study. All patients enrolled in 
both prospective studies had an ADAMTS-13 level above 5%. 
Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris or received prophylactic treatment 
with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of Soliris in adult and 
adolescent aHUS patients was 900 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg 7 ± 2 days 
later, then 1,200 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 35 minutes. The dosing regimen in paediatric patients and adolescents weighing less than 
40 kg was defined based on a pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation that identified the recommended dose and 
schedule based on body weight (see section 4.2). 
Primary endpoints included platelet count change from baseline in study C08-002A/B and thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA) event-free status in study C08-003A/B. Additional endpoints included TMA 
intervention rate, haematologic normalization, complete TMA response, changes in LDH, renal function 
and quality of life. TMA-event free status was defined as the absence for at least 12 weeks of the 
following: decrease in platelet count of > 25% from baseline, PE/PI, and new dialysis. TMA interventions 
were defined as PE/PI or new dialysis. Haematologic normalization was defined as normalization of 
platelet counts and LDH levels sustained for ≥2 consecutive measurements for ≥4 weeks. Complete TMA 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response was defined as haematologic normalization and a ≥25% reduction in serum creatinine sustained 
in ≥ 2 consecutive measurements for ≥ 4 weeks. 
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 5.

Patients in aHUS Study C08-002 A/B received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of 
the initial 26-week treatment period, most patients continued to receive Soliris by enrolling into an 
extension study. In aHUS Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of Soliris therapy was 
approximately100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks). 
A reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were 
observed after commencement of Soliris. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all 
patients after commencement of Soliris. Table 6 summarizes the efficacy results for aHUS Study C08-
002A/B. All rates of efficacy endpoints improved or were maintained through 2 years of treatment. 
Complete TMA response was maintained by all responders. When treatment was continued for more than 
26 weeks, two additional patients achieved and maintained Complete TMA response due to normalization 
of LDH (1 patient) and a decrease in serum creatinine (2 patients).  
Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during Soliris therapy. Four of the 
five patients who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis for the duration of 
Soliris treatment, and one patient developed a new dialysis requirement. Patients reported improved 
health-related quality of life (QoL). 
In aHUS Study C08-002A/B, responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified 
mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins. 
Patients in aHUS study C08-003A/B received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of the 
initial 26-week treatment period, most patients continued to receive Soliris by enrolling into an extension 
study. In aHUS Study C08-003A/B, the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 114 weeks 
(range: 26 to 129 weeks). Table 6 summarizes the efficacy results for aHUS Study C08-003A/B. 
In aHUS Study C08-003A/B, responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified 
mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins. Reduction in terminal complement 
activity was observed in all patients after commencement of Soliris. All rates of efficacy endpoints 
improved or were maintained through 2 years of treatment. Complete TMA response was maintained by 
all responders. When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, six additional patients achieved 
and maintained Complete TMA response due to a decrease in serum creatinine. No patient required new 
dialysis with Soliris. Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, increased during Soliris therapy.

aHUS Study C10-004  enrolled 41 patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In 
order to qualify for enrolment, patients were required to have a platelet count < lower limit of normal 
range (LLN), evidence of haemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the 
upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis.  The median patient age was 35 (range: 18 to 
80 years). All patients enrolled in aHUS Study C10-004 had an ADAMTS-13 level above 5%. Fifty-one 
percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 
35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 7 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease-
related characteristics of patients enrolled in aHUS C10-004.

Patients in aHUS Study C10-004 received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of the 
initial 26-week treatment period, most patients elected to continue on chronic dosing. 
Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were 
observed after commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as 
shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In aHUS C10-004, mean (±SD) 
platelet count increased from 119 ± 66 x109/L at baseline to 200 ± 84 x109/L by one week; this effect was 
maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (±SD) at week 26: 252 ± 70 x109/L). Renal function, as 
measured by eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis 
at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during Soliris treatment. Table 8 summarizes the efficacy 
results for aHUS study C10-004.

Longer term treatment with Soliris (median 52 weeks ranging from 15 to 126 weeks) was associated with 
an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in adult patients with aHUS. When Soliris 
treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, three additional patients (63% of patients in total) 
achieved Complete TMA response and four additional patients (98% of patients in total) achieved 
hematologic normalization. At the last evaluation, 25 of 41 patients (61%) achieved eGFR improvement 
of ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. 
Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis 
Data from 139 patients in two prospective controlled studies (Studies C08-001 and ECU-MG-301), and 
one open-label extension trial (Study ECU-MG-302) were used to evaluate the efficacy of Soliris in the 
treatment of patients with refractory gMG. 
Study ECU-MG-301 (REGAIN) was a 26-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-
center Phase 3 study of Soliris in patients who had failed previous therapies and remain symptomatic. One 
hundred and eighteen (118) of the 125 (94%) patients completed the 26-week treatment period and 
117 (94%) patients subsequently enrolled in Study ECU-MG-302, an open-label, multi-center long-term 
safety and efficacy extension study in which all patients received Soliris treatment. 
In Study ECU-MG-301, gMG patients with a positive serologic test for anti-AChR antibodies, MGFA 
(Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) clinical classification class II to IV and MG-ADL total score 
≥6 were randomized to either Soliris (n = 62) or placebo (n = 63). All patients included in the trial were 
refractory gMG patients and met the following predefined criteria: 
1) Failed treatment for at least one year with 2 or more immunosuppressant therapies (either in 
combination or as monotherapy), ie, patients continued to have impairment in activities of daily living 
despite immunosuppressant therapies 
OR 
2) Failed at least one immunosuppressant therapy and required chronic plasma exchange or IVIg to 
control symptoms, ie, patients require PE or IVIg on a regular basis for the management of muscle 
weakness at least every 3 months over previous 12 months. 
Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to initiating treatment with Soliris or received 
prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In Studies ECU-MG-
301 and ECU-MG-302, the dose of Soliris in adult refractory gMG patients was 900 mg every 7 ± 2 days 
for 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg at Week 5± 2 days, then 1,200 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study 
duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 35 minutes. 
Table 9 presents the baseline characteristics of the refractory gMG patients enrolled in Study ECU-MG-
301.

The primary endpoint for Study ECU-MG-301 was the change from baseline in the MG Activities of 
Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL – a patient reported outcome measure validated in gMG) total score at 
Week 26. The primary analysis of the MG-ADL was a Worst-Rank ANCOVA with a mean rank of 56.6 
for Soliris and 68.3 for placebo, based on 125 study patients (p=0.0698). 
The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Quantitative MG Scoring System (QMG 
– a physician reported outcome measure validated in gMG) total score at Week 26. The primary analysis 
of the QMG was a Worst-Rank ANCOVA with a mean rank of 54.7 for Soliris and 70.7 for placebo, 
based on 125 study patients  (p=0.0129). 
Efficacy outcomes for the pre-specified repeated measures analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpoints are provided in Table 10.

In Study ECU-MG-301, a clinical responder in the MG-ADL total score was defined as having at least a 
3-point improvement. The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was 59.7% 
on Soliris compared with 39.7% on placebo (p=0.0229).  
In Study ECU-MG-301, a clinical responder in the QMG total score was defined as having at least a 5-point 
improvement. The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was 45.2% on Soliris 
compared with 19% on placebo (p=0.0018).

Of the 125 patients enrolled in ECU-MG-301, 117 patients subsequently enrolled in a long-term extension 
study (Study ECU-MG-302), in which all received Soliris.. Patients that were previously treated with Soliris 
in Study ECU-MG-301 continued to demonstrate a sustained effect of Soliris on all measures (MG-ADL, 
QMG, MGC and MG-QoL15) over an additional 130 weeks of treatment with eculizumab in Study ECU-
MG-302.  For  patients  who  received  placebo  in  Study  ECU-MG-301  (placebo/eculizumab  arm  of  Study 
ECU-MG-302), improvement occurred after initiating treatment with eculizumab and was maintained for 
more than 130 weeks in Study ECU-MG-302. Figure 1 presents the change from baseline in both MG-ADL 
(A) and QMG (B) after 26 weeks of treatment in Study ECU-MG-301 and after 130 weeks of treatment (n 
= 80 patients) in Study ECU-MG-302.

In Study ECU-MG-302, physicians had the option to adjust background immunosuppressant therapies. In 
this setting, 65.0% of patients decreased their daily dose of at least 1 immunosuppressive therapy (IST); 
43.6% of patients stopped an existing IST. The most common reason for change in IST therapy was 
improvement in MG symptoms.  
Twenty-two (22) (17.6%) elderly refractory gMG patients (> 65 years of age) were treated with Soliris in 
the clinical trials. No substantial differences were seen in safety and efficacy related to age. 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
Data from 143 patients in one controlled study (Study ECU-NMO-301) and from 119 patients who 
continued in one open-label extension trial (Study ECU-NMO-302) were used to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of Soliris in the treatment of patients with NMOSD.  
Study ECU-NMO-301 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 3 study of 
Soliris in patients with NMOSD.  
In Study ECU-NMO-301, patients with NMOSD with a positive serologic test for anti-AQP4 antibodies, a 
history of at least 2 relapses in last 12 months or 3 relapses in the last 24 months with at least 1 relapse in 
the 12 months prior to screening and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤ 7, were 
randomized 2:1 to either Soliris (n = 96) or placebo (n = 47). Patients were permitted to receive 
background immunosuppressant therapies at stable dose during the study, with the exclusion of rituximab 
and mitoxantrone. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients either received meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment with 
Soliris or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In 
the eculizumab NMOSD clinical development program, the dose of Soliris in adult patients with NMOSD 
was 900 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg at Week 5 ± 2 days, then 1200 mg every 
14 ± 2 days for the study duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 35 minutes. 
The majority (90.9%) of patients were female. Approximately half were White (49.0%). The median age 
at first dose of study drug was 45 years.

The primary endpoint for Study ECU-NMO-301 was the time to first on-trial relapse as adjudicated by an 
independent committee who were blinded to treatment. A significant effect on the time to first adjudicated 
On-trial Relapse was observed for eculizumab compared with placebo (relative risk reduction 94%; hazard 
ratio 0.058; p<0.0001) (Figure 2). Soliris-treated patients experienced similar improvement in time to first 
adjudicated on-trial relapse with or without concomitant IST treatment.

Compared to placebo-treated patients, Soliris-treated patients had reduced annualized rates of 
hospitalizations (0.04 for Soliris versus 0.31 for placebo), of intravenous corticosteroid administrations to 
treat acute relapses (0.07 for Soliris versus 0.42 for placebo), and of plasma exchange treatments (0.02 for 
Soliris versus 0.19 for placebo). 
The distribution of changes from Baseline to End of Study on other secondary endpoints favored 
eculizumab treatment over placebo across all neurologic disability (EDSS score [p=0.0597] and mRS 
[nominal p=0.0154]), functional disability (HAI [nominal p=0.0002]) and quality of life (EQ-5D VAS 
[nominal p=0.0309] and EQ-5D Index [nominal p= 0.0077]) measures.  
The final analysis of Study ECU-NMO-302 demonstrates a significant and clinically meaningful reduction 
in On-trial ARR (as determined by the Treating Physician) on eculizumab treatment, based on the median 
(min, max) change (-1.825 [-6.38, 1.02], p<0.0001) from historical ARR (24 months prior to screening in 
Study ECU-NMO-301).  
In Study ECU-NMO-302, physicians had the option to adjust background immunosuppressant therapies. In 
this setting, the most common change in immunosuppressant therapy was decreased immunosuppressant 
therapy dose, which occurred in 21.0% of patients. Further, 15.1% of patients stopped an existing IST. 
Soliris (eculizumab) has not been studied for the treatment of acute relapses in NMOSD patients. 
Paediatric population 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
A total of 7 PNH paediatric patients, with a median weight of 57.2 kg (range of 48.6 to 69.8 kg) and aged 
from 11 to 17 years (median age : 15.6 years), received Soliris in study M07-005.  
Treatment with eculizumab at the proposed dosing regimen in the paediatric population was associated 
with a reduction of intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum LDH level. It also resulted in a marked 
decrease or elimination of blood transfusions, and a trend towards an overall improvement in general 
function. The efficacy of eculizumab treatment in paediatric PNH patients appears to be consistent with 
that observed in adult PNH patients enrolled in PNH pivotal Studies (C04-001 and C04-002) (Table 3 and 
14).

Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
A total of 15 paediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) received Soliris in aHUS Study C09-001r. 
Forty seven percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. 
The median time from aHUS diagnosis to first dose of Soliris was 14 months (range <1, 110 months). The 
median time from current thrombotic microangiopathy manifestation to first dose of Soliris was 1 month 
(range <1 to 16 months). The median duration of Soliris therapy was 16 weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for 
children < 2 years of age (n=5) and 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) for children 2 to <12 years of age 
(n=10).  
Overall, the efficacy results for these paediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in 
patients enrolled in aHUS pivotal Studies C08-002 and C08-003 (Table 6). No paediatric patient required 
new dialysis during treatment with Soliris.

In paediatric patients with shorter duration of current severe clinical thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
manifestation prior to eculizumab, there was TMA control and improvement of renal function with 
eculizumab treatment (Table 15). 
In paediatric patients with longer duration of current severe clinical TMA manifestation prior to 
eculizumab, there was TMA control with eculizumab treatment.  However, renal function was not 
changed due to prior irreversible kidney damage (Table 16).

A total of 22 paediatric and adolescents patients (aged 5 months to 17 years) received Soliris in 
aHUS Study C10-003. 
In Study C10-003, patients who enrolled in the study were required to have a platelet count < lower limit 
of normal range (LLN), evidence of haemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH above the upper limits 
of normal and serum creatinine level ≥97 percentile for age without the need for chronic dialysis.  The 
median patient age was 6.5 years (range: 5 months to 17 years). Patients enrolled in aHUS C10-003   had 
an ADAMTS-13 level above 5%. Fifty percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor 
mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 10 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 17 summarizes 
the key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in aHUS Study C10-003.

Patients in aHUS C10-003 received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of the initial 26-
week treatment period, most patients elected to continue on chronic dosing. Reduction in terminal 
complement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of 
complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 
weeks. The mean (±SD) platelet count increased from 88 ± 42 x109/L at baseline to 281 ± 123 x109/L by 
one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (±SD) at week 26: 293 ± 106 
x109/L). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Nine of the 11 
patients who required dialysis at baseline no longer required dialysis after Study Day 15 of eculizumab 
treatment. Responses were similar across all ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. In aHUS C10-003, 
responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding 
complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.

1 Through data cut-off (October 12, 2012), with median duration of Soliris therapy of 44 weeks (range: 1 dose to 88 
weeks). 
Longer term treatment with Soliris (median 55 weeks ranging from 1day to 107 weeks) was associated 
with an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in paediatric and adolescent patients with 
aHUS. When Soliris treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, one additional patient (68% of 
patients in total) achieved Complete TMA Response and two additional patients (91% of patients in total) 
achieved hematologic normalization. At the last evaluation, 19 of 22 patients (86%) achieved eGFR 
improvement of  ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. No patient required new dialysis with Soliris. 
Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis 
A total of 11 paediatric patients with refractory gMG received Soliris in study ECU-MG-303. The median 
(range) body weight of the treated patients was 59.7 kg (37.2 to 91.2 kg) at baseline, and the median 
(range) age of 15 years (12 to 17 years) at screening. All patients included in the study were patients with 
refractory gMG who had one or more of the following: 
1. Failed treatment ≥ 1 year with at least 1 IST, defined as: (i) Persistent weakness with impairment of 
activities of daily living, or (ii) Myasthenia gravis exacerbation and/or crisis while on treatment, 
or (iii) Intolerance to ISTs due to side effect or comorbid condition(s). 
2. Require maintenance PE or IVIg to control symptoms (ie, patients who require PE or IVIg on a 
regular basis for the management of muscle weakness at least every 3 months over the last 
12 months prior to screening).

The primary endpoint of study ECU-MG-303 was the change from baseline in the QMG total score over 
time regardless of rescue therapy. Paediatric patients treated with Soliris demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement from baseline in QMG total score throughout the Primary Evaluation Treatment 
Period of 26 weeks. The results for the primary and main secondary endpoint in study ECU-MG-303 are 
included in Table 20.   
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of Soliris treatment in paediatric patients with refractory gMG was consistent with that 
observed in adult patients with refractory gMG enrolled in the pivotal study ECU-MG-301 (Table 10).

In study ECU-MG-303, a clinical responder in the QMG and MG-ADL total scores was defined as having 
at  least  a  5-point  improvement  and  3-point improvement  from  baseline,  respectively.  The  proportion  of 
clinical responders in the QMG and MG-ADL total scores at Week 26 regardless of rescue therapy was 70% 
and 50%, respectively. The 10 patients who completed their visit at Week 26 achieved improved status of 
MGFA  Post-Interventional  Status  (MGFA-PIS)  at  Week 26.  Seven  (70%)  patients  achieved  minimal 
manifestation of refractory gMG at Week 26. 
An  event  of  clinical  deterioration  (MG  crisis)  was  observed  in  1 patient  (9.1%)  during  the  Primary 
Evaluation Treatment Period requiring rescue therapy (PE) which was administered between the Week 22 
and Week 24 study visits. As a result and due to physician decision, this patient did not have QMG, MG-
ADL or other efficacy assessments after Week 20 and did not enter the extension period.  . 
During the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period in paediatric patients with refractory gMG (study ECU-
MG-303), 1 out of 11 patients (9.1%) decreased daily dose of anticholinesterase and 3 out of 11 patients 
(27.3%) decreased their daily dose of corticosteroid, due to improved MG symptoms.  
.  
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
Soliris has not been evaluated in paediatric patients with NMOSD. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Soliris in 
one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of NMOSD (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Human antibodies undergo endocytotic digestion in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. 
Eculizumab contains only naturally occurring amino acids and has no known active metabolites. Human 
antibodies are predominately catabolized by lysosomal enzymes to small peptides and amino acids. 
Elimination 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the hepatic, renal, lung, or gastrointestinal routes of 
excretion/elimination for Soliris. In normal kidneys, antibodies are not excreted and are excluded from 
filtration by their size. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s)  
In 40 patients with PNH, a 1-compartmental model was used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters after 
multiple doses. Mean clearance was 0.31 ± 0.12 mL/hr/kg, mean volume of distribution was 110.3 ± 
17.9 mL/kg, and mean elimination half-life was 11.3 ± 3.4 days. The steady state is achieved by 4 weeks 
using the PNH adult dosing regimen. 
In PNH patients, pharmacodynamic activity correlates directly with eculizumab serum concentrations and 
maintenance of trough levels above ≥ 35 microgram/mL results in essentially complete blockade of 
haemolytic activity in the majority of PNH patients. 
A second population PK analysis with a standard 1 compartmental model was conducted on the multiple 
dose PK data from 37 aHUS patients receiving the recommended Soliris regimen in studies C08-002A/B 
and C08-003A/B. In this model, the clearance of Soliris for a typical aHUS patient weighing 70 kg was 
0.0139 L/hr and the volume of distribution was 5.6 L. The elimination half-life was 297 h (approximately 
12.4 days).  
The second population PK model was applied to the multiple dose PK data from 22 paediatric aHUS 
patients receiving the recommended Soliris regimen in aHUS C10-003. The clearance and volume of 
distribution of Soliris are weight dependent, which forms the basis for a weight categorical based dose 
regimen in paediatric patients (see section 4.2). Clearance values of Soliris in paediatric aHUS patients 
were 10.4, 5.3, and 2.2 mL/hr with body weight of 70, 30, and 10 kg, respectively; and the corresponding 
volume of distribution values were 5.23, 2.76, and 1.21 L, respectively. The corresponding elimination 
half-life remained almost unchanged within a range of 349 to 378 h (approximately 14.5 to 15.8 days). 
The clearance and half-life of eculizumab were also evaluated during plasma exchange interventions.  
Plasma exchange resulted in an approximately 50% decline in eculizumab concentrations following a 
1 hour intervention and the elimination half-life of eculizumab was reduced to 1.3 hours. Supplemental 
dosing is recommended when Soliris is administered to aHUS patients receiving plasma infusion or 
exchange (see section 4.2). 
All aHUS patients treated with Soliris when administered as recommended demonstrated rapid and 
sustained reduction in terminal complement activity. In aHUS patients, pharmacodynamic activity 
correlates directly with eculizumab serum concentrations and maintenance of trough levels of 
approximately 50-100 microgram/ml results in essentially complete blockade of terminal complement 
activity in all aHUS patients.  
PK parameters are consistent across PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD patient populations.  
Pharmacodynamic activity measured by free C5 concentrations of <0.5 ug/mL, is correlated with 
essentially complete blockade of terminal complement activity in PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and 
NMOSD patients.  
Special Populations 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dedicated studies have not been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Soliris in special patient 
populations identified by gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  
Population PK analysis on data collected across studies in PNH, aHUS, gMG and NMOSD patients 
showed that gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment function do not 
influence the PK of eculizumab. Body weight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab 
clearance in paediatric patients requiring body weight based dosing in paediatric patients.  
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab was evaluated in Study M07-005 in PNH paediatric patients (aged 
from 11 to less than 18 years), in Studies C08-002, C08-003, C09-001r and C10-003 in aHUS paediatric 
patients (aged 2 months to less than 18 years), and in Study ECU-MG-303 paediatric patients with 
refractory gMG (aged from 12 years to less than 18 years) with body-weight based dose regimen.  
Weight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab clearance 0.0105 L/h in the adolescent 
PNH patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The specificity of eculizumab for C5 in human serum was evaluated in two in vitro studies.   
The tissue cross-reactivity of eculizumab was evaluated by assessing binding to a panel of 38 human 
tissues. C5 expression in the human tissue panel examined in this study is consistent with published 
reports of C5 expression, as C5 has been reported in smooth muscle, striated muscle, and renal proximal 
tubular epithelium. No unexpected tissue cross-reactivity was observed. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab due to lack of pharmacologic 
activity in non-human species.  
In a 26 week toxicity study performed in mice with a surrogate antibody directed against murine C5, 
treatment did not affect any of the toxicity parameters examined. Haemolytic activity during the course of 
the study was effectively blocked in both female and male mice.  
No clear treatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in reproductive toxicology studies in 
mice with a surrogate terminal complement inhibitory antibody, which was utilized to assess the 
reproductive safety of C5 blockade. These studies included assessment of fertility and early embryonic 
development, developmental toxicity, and pre and post-natal development. 
When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and 
one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher 
antibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human Soliris dose, based on a body 
weight comparison); however, the exposure did not increase foetal loss or neonatal death. 
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of 
eculizumab.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Soliris is and what it is used for 
What is Soliris 
Soliris contains the active substance eculizumab and it belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal 
antibodies. Eculizumab binds to and inhibits a specific protein in the body that causes inflammation and so 
prevents your body’s systems from attacking and destroying vulnerable blood cells, kidneys, muscles or 
eye nerves and spinal cord. 
What is Soliris used for 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
Soliris is used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood system 
called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH). In patients with PNH, their red blood cells can be 
destroyed which can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, dark 
urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab can block the body’s inflammatory response, and 
its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable PNH blood cells.  
Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
Soliris is also used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood 
system and kidney called atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). In patients with aHUS, their 
kidney and blood cells, including platelets, can be inflamed which can lead to low blood counts 
(thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood clots, tiredness and difficulty in 
functioning. Eculizumab can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy 
its own vulnerable blood and kidney cells.  
Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis 
Soliris is also used to treat adult and children patients aged 6 years and above with a certain type of 
disease affecting the muscles and called generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG). In patients with gMG, 
their muscles can be attacked and damaged by the immune system which can lead to profound muscle 
weakness, impaired mobility, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impaired activities of daily living. Soliris can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to 
attack and destroy its own muscles to improve muscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the 
disease and impact of the disease on the activities of daily living. Soliris is specifically indicated for 
patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with other existing MG therapies. 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders 
Soliris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease that predominantly affects the eye 
nerves and the spinal cord called Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD). In patients with 
NMOSD, their eye nerve and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by the immune system which can lead 
to blindness in one or both eyes, weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of 
sensation, and markedly impaired activities of daily living. Soliris can block the body’s inflammatory 
response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own eye nerves and spinal cord, thereby reducing 
symptoms of the disease and impact of the disease on the activities of daily living. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Soliris 
Do not use Soliris 
- 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to eculizumab, proteins derived from mouse products, other monoclonal 
antibodies, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless you take antibiotics to 
reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated . 
If you have a meningococcal infection. 
Warnings and precautions 
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections alert 
Soliris treatment may reduce your natural resistance to infections, especially against certain organisms that 
cause meningococcal infection (severe infection of the linings of the brain and sepsis) and other Neisseria 
infections including disseminated gonorrhea. 
Consult your doctor before you take Soliris to be sure that you receive vaccination against Neisseria 
meningitidis, an organism that causes meningococcal infection, at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy, 
or that you take antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should also be aware that 
vaccination may not prevent this type of infection. In accordance with national recommendations, your 
doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to prevent infection. 
If you are at risk of gonorrhoea, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating certain types of infection in patients who 
receive Soliris, you will be provided a card to carry with you, listing specific trigger symptoms. This card 
is named: “Patient Safety Card”. 
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:    
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
headache with nausea or vomiting 
headache with a stiff neck or back 
fever 
rash  
confusion  
severe muscle aches combined with flu-like symptoms 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
sensitivity to light 
Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a remote region where you are unable to contact your doctor or in which you find 
yourself temporarily unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor can make arrangements to issue, as 
a preventive measure, a prescription for an antibiotic to counter Neisseria meningitidis that you keep with 
you. If you experience any of the symptoms amongst those cited above, you should take the antibiotics as 
prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should see a doctor as soon as possible, even if you feel 
better after having taken the antibiotics. 
Infections 
Before starting Soliris, inform your doctor if you have any infections. 
Allergic reactions 
Soliris contains a protein and proteins can cause allergic reactions in some people.  
Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal 
infections 
Older people 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over. 
Other medicines and Soliris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Women of childbearing potential 
The use of effective contraception during treatment and up to 5 months after treatment should be 
considered in women who are able to get pregnant.  
Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Soliris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
Soliris contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicine contains 0.88 g 
sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 240 mL at the maximal dose. This is equivalent to 44 % 
of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You should take this into 
consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.67 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 240 mL at the maximal dose. This is equivalent 
to 33.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You should take this 
into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
3.  How to use Soliris 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Soliris, your doctor will administer a vaccine against 
meningococcal infection if it was not previously administered or if your vaccination is outdated. If your 
child is below the age of vaccination or if you are not vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start 
treatment with Soliris, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks 
after you have been vaccinated. 
Your doctor will administer a vaccine to your child aged less than 18 years against Haemophilus 
influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination recommendations for each 
age group. 
Instructions for proper use 
The treatment will be given by your doctor or other health care provider by infusing a dilution of the

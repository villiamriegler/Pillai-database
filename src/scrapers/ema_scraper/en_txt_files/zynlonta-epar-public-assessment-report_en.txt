2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved indication is: 
Zynlonta as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors  
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of NHL and accounts for 25% to 45% of all 
NHL cases worldwide (Wild et al., 2020; Sant et al., 2014) and comprises 60% of all new lymphomas 
in the elderly population (Thieblemont and Coiffier, 2007). The disease causes approximately 8500 
new cases in Europe (Sant et al. 2010) and an estimated 4000 deaths per year (Marcos-Gragera et al. 
2011, De Angelis et al. 2015, Howlader et al. 2016). The incidence of DLBCL increases with age, it is 
mainly an adult/elderly disease. Based on data from the European HAEMACARE project, the incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 9/157 
 
 
 
 
rises from <1/100,000 in children to 10-15/100,000 in patients aged 65 years and older, with most 
cases occurring in adults >54 years of age (Sant et al. 2010).  
A family history of lymphoma, autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity, a high body mass as a young adult and some occupational 
exposures have been identified as risk factors of DLBCL (Morton el al. 2014). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma represents a biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of 
lymphoproliferative malignancies which in 90% of cases are derived from B-cells with DLBCL with 
distinctive prognostic profiles including cell of origin: germinal centre B-cell (GCB) type or activated B-
cell (ABC) type. Identified prognostic factors include expression of MYC, BCL2 and ENO3 genes 
(Carreras et al. 2020), TP53 deletion or mutation (Tessoulin et al. 2017), and aberrant microRNA 
expression (Ting et al. 2019). “Double-expression” (overexpression of MYC and BCL2 proteins), 
“double-hit” (dual translocation of MYC and BCL2 or BCL6) and “triple-hit” (chromosomal alterations in 
MYC, BCL2, and BCL6) DLBCL are associated with a particularly poor prognosis (Carreras et al. 2020, 
Xia and Zhang 2020, Rosenthal and Younes 2017). The ABC (non-GCB) type has been associated with 
worse outcome (Nowakowski et al. 2015, Hans et al. 2004, Lenz et al. 2008). DLBCL have been 
categorised into different subtypes with different characteristics, such as T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell 
lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL, DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS) and others. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Approximately 25% of DLBCL patients are diagnosed with localised or limited stage disease and 
typically have a more favourable prognosis; approximately 75% of DLBCL patients present with 
advanced stage disease, defined as Ann Arbor Stage III and IV or Stage I and II with associated B-
symptoms or bulky disease (≥10 cm) (Sehn and Gascoyne, 2015). DLBCL is most frequently diagnosed 
between the age of 65-74 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years (Smith et al. 2015). 
DLBCL is an aggressive disease with short life expectancy if left untreated. With currently available 
treatments, around 50% of newly diagnosed patients can be cured. DLBCL may arise as de novo, but it 
can also arise from a prior/existing low-grade (indolent) lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma (FL) 
or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), it is then commonly referred to as transformed lymphoma. 
Approximately 10% to 15% of patients exhibit primary refractory disease (nonresponse or relapse 
within 3 months of therapy) and an additional 20% to 25% of patients relapse, usually within the first 
2 years, following initial response (Sehn and Gascoyne, 2015).  
Salvage therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HD-ASCT), 
can be effective treatment and potentially curative for DLBCL patients with chemotherapy-sensitive 
relapse (Philip et al., 1995). However, over half of the patients treated in this fashion will not have 
long-term disease control (Gisselbrecht, 2010). The prognosis of patients whose disease is refractory 
to initial chemotherapy and therefore not eligible for HD-ASCT, or who relapse early after HD-ASCT, is 
extremely poor. These patients have a poor response to salvage therapy, with an objective response 
rate of 26% (CR rate 7%) and a median survival of approximately 6 months (Crump, 2017).  
2.1.5.  Management 
In patients progressing or relapsing after first-line treatment, the ultimate goal is salvage 
chemotherapy mainly with platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based regimens, followed by high-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 10/157 
 
 
 
chemotherapy (HDC) with ASCT. Many patients are not fit enough to receive intensive chemotherapy 
regimens, e.g. because of older age or comorbidities. For these patients, the outcome is dismal with 
generally no prolonged periods of disease control (Thieblemont and Coiffier 2007).  
Treatment options for patients who have relapsed or progressed after second-line treatment of DLBCL 
are limited, and there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment. According to guidelines by the 
European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) (Tilly et al. 2015) for patients in more than second 
relapse, recommendations for fit patients is a second HD-ASCT, allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) 
or participation in clinical trials with novel drugs. For those who are non-fit and transplant –non-
eligible, treatment options are participation in clinical studies with novel drugs or palliative care.  
Recently other treatment options have become available. There are 2 CD19-directed chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies (axicabtagene ciloleucel [Yescarta SmPC 2021] and tisagenlecleucel 
[KymriahÒ SmPC, 2021]) approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta only) after 2 or more lines of systemic 
therapy. The ORR for these therapies ranged from 37% to 74%, with a CRR ranging from 28% to 
54%. Median duration of response (DOR) was not estimable/not reached (Yescarta/Kymriah, 
respectively).  
Pixantrone (Pixuvri) is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of multiply relapsed or refractory 
aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (Pixuvri SmPC, 2020). Fifty-three of the 70 patients 
enrolled in the pixantrone arm of the study were DLBCL patients. Patients treated with pixantrone 
showed higher response rates compared to the comparator group (investigator chosen single-agent 
chemotherapy): best CR (pixantrone, 15.7%; comparator, 0%), and a higher ORR (pixantrone, 40%; 
comparator, 14.3%). Median PFS for pixantrone was 5.3 versus 2.6 months for the comparator while 
OS was 10.2 versus 7.6 months (Pixuvri SmPC, 2020).   
Polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) is an anti-CD79b ADC that has been approved in combination with 
bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not 
candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) (Polivy SmPC, 2021). Patients were 
randomised 1:1 to receive either polatuzumab vedotin in combination with BR or BR alone. Eligible 
patients were not candidates for HD-ASCT and the study excluded patients who had transformed 
lymphoma or prior HD-allogeneic SCT (AlloSCT). The best ORR in the experimental arm was 63%, with 
a CRR of 50%. A DOR of ≥6 months was observed in 64% of patients and ≥12 months in 48% of 
patients.  
Tafasitamab (Minjuvi) is an anti-CD19 antibody that has recently received a conditional marketing 
authorisation for use in combination with lenalidomide followed by tafasitamab monotherapy in 
patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL NOS, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma.  
The study was a single-arm trial, and patients had to be not eligible for ASCT (Minjuvi SmPC, 2021). 
Efficacy was evaluated in 81 patients with DLBCL. The combination showed an ORR of 56.8%, with a 
CRR of 39.5% and a DOR of 43.9 months.  
However, all current treatment options in the R/R DLBCL present a substantial degree of toxicity and 
over half of patients will not have a durable response. Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for 
patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. 
2.2.  About the product 
Loncastuximab tesirine (LT) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanised 
monoclonal antibody (RB4v1.2) specific for human CD19 of the immunoglobin G1, kappa isotype, 
conjugated through a cathepsin-cleavable linker to SG3199, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 11/157 
 
 
 
cytotoxin. The toxin SG3199 attached to the linker is designated as SG3249, also known as tesirine 
(Tiberghien, 2016). LT binds with picomolar affinity to human CD19. After binding and internalisation, 
LT is trafficked to the lysosomes, where the protease-sensitive linker is cleaved and the unconjugated 
PBD dimers (SG3199) are released inside the target cell. The released PBD dimers bind into the minor 
groove of DNA and form cytotoxic DNA interstrand cross-links. The cross-links result in a stalled DNA 
replication fork, blocking cell division and causing cell death (Hartley, 2011). The cross-links formed by 
PBD dimers are relatively nondistorting of the DNA structure, making them hidden to repair 
mechanisms (Adair et al 2012, Beck et al 2017). 
Human CD19 antigen is a 95 kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin 
super family (Carter and Barrington, 2004; Tedder, 2009). In normal human tissue, expression of 
CD19 is restricted to the various stages of B-cell development, from early pre-B stage to mature B-
cells, but is lost in terminally differentiated plasma cells (Haas, 2005; Scheuermann and Racila, 1995). 
Once bound to an antibody, CD19 is rapidly internalised by the cell (Gerber, 2009; Blanc, 2011). It is 
not shed into the circulation to the extent observed with other CD antigens (Cooper, 2004); therefore, 
low to no levels of soluble CD19 are present to compete with binding at the target tissue. Expression of 
CD19 is maintained in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and follicular 
lymphoma. Additionally, CD19 expression is maintained in B-cell tumors that have lost expression of 
CD20 after anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment (Anderson, 1984; Scheuermann and Racila, 
1995; Wang, 2012). 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation based 
on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
To provide further confirmatory evidence for the efficacy and safety of loncastuximab tesirine, 
the applicant has initiated the Phase 3 clinical study ADCT-402-311 in March 2021.  
This trial is conducted to confirm post-authorisation the therapeutic value and positive benefit-
risk balance of loncastuximab tesirine as a treatment of R/R DLBCL. ADCT-402-311 is a 
controlled, randomised study of loncastuximab tesirine combined with the well-established CD-
20-targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab (Lonca-R) versus standard immunochemotherapy 
in patients with R/R DLBCL. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Lonca-R compared to standard 
immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not eligible for ASCT. After 
a safety run-in phase with 20 patients treated with Lonca-R, subsequent patients 
(approximately 330) will be randomly assigned to either Lonca-R or rituximab / gemcitabine / 
oxaliplatin (1:1). PFS is the primary endpoint and OS the key secondary endpoint. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as:  
Currently, many patients with R/R DLBCL will receive treatment with chemotherapy regimens 
which are composed of one or more chemotherapy agents not specifically approved for use in 
DLBCL. In the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines treatment options for 
3rd line therapy is limited to allogenic transplant (if eligible), clinical trials with novel drugs, or 
palliative care (Tilly et al 2015). Similarly, the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) 
guidelines for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma list over 20 different combinations that can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022

used in R/R DLBCL (NCCN 2021). 
However, the response to many of these regimens is low and short-lived. A recent analysis of 
patients requiring treatment for R/R DLBCL revealed that patients receiving 3rd line treatment 
had a response rate of 27%, and the ORR was even lower for patients who were refractory 
(defined as no response to or relapse within 6 months of last treatment) at 21.2%. Response 
rates were even poorer in patients who received ≥4th line, with <10% of patients responding 
to therapy (Radford 2019). In addition, the overall survival for these patients is quite short, 
with a median of approximately 6 months (Radford 2019, Halwani et al 2019). 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required.  
In view of the substantial and robust anti-tumour activity, the favourable safety profile with no 
indication of unacceptable toxicities and risks in the broad R/R DLBCL patient population 
studied, and the limitations of available treatment options, it is considered important to make 
loncastuximab tesirine available to patients - for some of whom it will be a last treatment 
option. Loncastuximab tesirine does not only present a positive risk-benefit ratio but, 
additionally, advantages over available therapies of R/R DLBCL, fulfilling unmet medical needs 
and providing additional benefit to public health with early market availability although 
comprehensive and confirmative clinical data are still required. 
2.4.  Quality aspects

of Loncastuximab tesirine as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: L-histidine, L-histidine monohydrochloride, polysorbate 20, sucrose. 
The product is available in vial made of clear Type 1 glass, closed with a stopper (teflon-coated

2.4.2.  Active substance 
Loncastuximab tesirine is a human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19)-targeted antibody drug 
conjugate (ADC), consisting of a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa monoclonal antibody 
specific for human CD19 (RB4v1.2 mAb), conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxic 
drug (SG3199) through a protease-cleavable valine-alanine linker. The cytotoxin SG3199 together with 
the attached linker components is designated as tesirine (also referred to as SG3249 drug linker). 
2.4.2.1.  Active Substance - tesirine 
2.4.2.1.1.  General information 
The chemical name of tesirine (also referred as SG3249) is [4-[[(2S)-2-[[(2S)-2-[3-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-
[2-[2-[3-(2,5-dioxopyrrol-1-

11-oxo-6a,7-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepin-3-yl]oxy]pentoxy]-6-hydroxy-2-methoxy-8-
methyl-11-oxo-6a,7-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine-5-carboxylate,  corresponding to 
the molecular formula C75H101N9O23. It has a relative molecular mass of 1496.7 and the structure 
shown in Figure 1. 
Tesirine comprises the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxic drug (SG3199), para-aminobenzyl 
carbamate (PABC), a protease sensitive valine-alanine linker (Val-Ala dipeptide), a PEG8 spacer and a 
maleimide linker.  
Figure 1. Tesirine chemical structure 
The structural characteristics of tesirine (SG3249) have been confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (IR), 
proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass 
spectrometry. Respective spectra and their interpretation have been presented. No elemental analysis 
data have been presented, but the justification presented by the applicant was considered acceptable 
because of the more informative one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) along 
with mass spectrometry and infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-FT) that were presented.  
Tesirine is white to off-white to yellow to brown hygroscopic solid. It is practically insoluble in water; 
but very slightly to freely soluble is organic solvents. Polymorphism has not been reported in the 
literature. 
There are five stereocentres however tesirine is manufactured as a single isomer since stereochemistry 
of the molecule is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the stereoselective 
synthetic process. In addition chirality is controlled in the specifications of tesirine. 
2.4.2.1.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tesirine is manufactured and tested at appropriately authorised sites. Manufacturing steps have been 
sufficiently described. Detailed description of manufacturing process, with quantities of each reagent 
used has been presented. For reagents/solvents/process aids specifications have been presented. The 
input charge amounts of each reagent, with respect to the basis charge for each step, have been 
presented along with the estimated yields of each reaction. Proven acceptable ranges, which have 
served to define the quality acceptable ranges (QARs), have been established during process 
development studies. Design space is not claimed. In-process control specifications as well as 
intermediates specifications have been presented. Analytical procedures used have been described and

respective validations have been provided. Operations are conducted under nitrogen and protected 
from light where reasonably possible.  
There are four starting materials (SMs). A Major Objection (MO) was raised in relation to the selection 
of two of the SMs. In their response the applicant further justified the choice of these SMs in line with 
the ICH Q11 principles. Specifically the origin control and fate of the three chiral centres in the SMs 
was sufficiently discussed. The syntheses of these two SMs has been presented with all steps covering 
the introduction of all stereogenic centres. In addition the complete manufacturing process and the 
detailed SG3249 synthesis pathway that covers introduction of all stereogenic centres was provided. 
Further information was presented about the two chiral centres formed during the ring formation. The 
configuration was confirmed by a combination of 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments. Moreover the absolute 
stereochemistry of tesirine was  assessed by comparison of the proposed SMs with their synthetised 
enantiomers. Finally to ensure the stereochemical configuration of the proposed SMs a chiral HPLC 
method has been implemented in their  specifications. In conclusion these two proposed SMs were 
considered acceptable in view of the additional information and the MO has been resolved. 
The other two SMs were defined as such in response a MO concerning another SM which was originally 
proposed. This originally proposed SM has been redefined as reaction intermediate and two newly 
proposed starting materials have been designated. The QP declaration has been appropriately updated 
following the redefinition of SMs. The information provided after redefinition of the starting materials is 
acceptable. The CHMP further recommended the applicant to submit a post-approval variation 
including final control strategy and batch analysis; updating accordingly the manufacturing process to 
indicate the actual quantities (or ranges) of materials as used; if not otherwise justified, updating the 
acceptance limits for the newly designated starting material in line with the batch data (REC). 
The characterisation of the AS and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry 
of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Information provided on fate and purge of impurities arising from the synthesis of the starting 
materials is considered sufficient. Schemes of synthesis of starting materials, as well as specifications, 
along with analytical procedures description and summary of validation have been presented. Fate and 
purge of impurities have been also presented. 
Process validation has been performed and results were provided albeit not required. It can be 
concluded that the above campaigns demonstrate a high level of assurance that the SG3249 
manufacturing process and associated controls reliably and consistently produce product of appropriate 
quality.  
Extensive, narrative description of the manufacturing process development has also been presented. 
This section has mainly focused on the fate and purge of possible process impurities. Spiking studies 
have been performed. The capability of the manufacturing process for impurities removing has also 
been discussed. Also, non-specified impurities have been characterised. Potential residual solvents 
have also been mentioned. 
The packaging material for tesirine has been sufficiently described and is acceptable.  
2.4.2.1.3.  Specification 
Tesirine (SG3249) intermediate specification includes tests for appearance, identification, assay, 
purity, and impurities. The proposed specification covers all required attributes. The ICH M7 guideline 
does not apply to active substances intended for cancer indications. Additionally, as the drug linker is 
itself genotoxic, the exposure to a mutagenic impurity would not significantly add to the cancer risk of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 15/157 
 
 
 
the active substance. Therefore, impurities could be controlled at acceptable levels for non-mutagenic 
impurities. A satisfactory discussion on solvent derived genotoxic or potential genotoxic impurities has 
been provided. Limits for impurities have been sufficiently tightened during the procedure. In addition, 
the applicant has stated that the specification will be reassessed after data from an additional 15 
batches is obtained (for a total of approximately 30 batches). 
Analytical methods used in control of tesirine (both release and during stability studies) have been 
described at the sufficient level of details. All release and stability methods have been validated. 
Results are within predefined acceptance criteria. Reference standards have been described at the 
sufficient level of details. 
Batch analysis data of several batches of tesirine (SG3249), including toxicology, development, clinical 
GMP, validation and post-validation batches have been presented. All batches are within limits defined 
at the time of testing. 
2.4.2.1.4.  Stability 
Stability data for batches  stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 48 months under 
long-term (≤-65°C (-80°C ± 10°C)), intermediate (-20 ± 5°C), for 6 months under accelerated (5 ± 
3°C) and for 1 month in stressed (25 ± 2°C / 60% ± 5% RH) conditions were provided.  
Samples were tested for appearance, identity, assay and purity, water content, chiral purity content 
and impurities. No significant differences are noted between batches stored under long term and 
accelerated conditions. Results obtained showed no relevant changes under any of the 
abovementioned conditions and no trends were observed.  
Stability studies at intermediate (-20°C ± 5°C), accelerated (+5 ± 3°C) and stressed (+25 ± 2°C / 
60% ± 5% RH) conditions in addition to the intended long-term storage temperature (≤-65°C) in 
order to support short term exposure to higher temperatures during the SG3249 substance 
manufacturing process and any transient temperature excursions which may occur during shipment 
between the manufacturing sites.  
The demonstrated stability of SG3249 at -20°C and 5°C in the primary stability studies, over periods of 
up to 12 months and 6 months respectively, and the limited effect of storage at 25°C /60% RH over a 
1- to 3-month period contrast with data from the supportive studies where degradation at 5°C and at 
25°C / 60% RH was evident in all batches. This difference is attributed to the protective effect of the 
secondary and tertiary packaging and included desiccant which are designed to prevent water ingress 
during storage.  
In addition, forced degradation studies of SG3249 in acetonitrile with an equal aqueous volume of acid, 
base or peroxide were performed. SG3249 readily degrades in solution when exposed to acidic, basic, 
and oxidative conditions. A number of degradation products have been identified. In contrast, there 
was no reduction in purity or change in the impurity profile of material stored at room temperature for 
30 days under an inert atmosphere.  
Exposure of SG3249 to light (2.4 million lux hours) resulted in decrease in purity; confirmatory 
photostability testing of SG3249 (1.2 million lux hours) also resulted in degradation.  
It has been further concluded that these studies demonstrate that the HPLC methodology adopted for 
SG3249 stability studies is stability-indicating and suitable for use. 
Assessment report

Overall it has been concluded that the results of stability studies confirm that SG3249 intermediate 
drug linker is sufficiently stable when the intermediate is stored in the intended packaging. The 
proposed retest period and storage conditions are acceptable 
2.4.2.2.  Active Substance – loncastuximab (monoclonal-antibody) 
2.4.2.2.1.  General information 
Loncastuximab (also referred as RB4v1.2), is full-length humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb), 
produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and comprises two IgG1 heavy chains and two kappa 
light chains, directed against the human CD19 antigen. Each heavy chain is composed of 449 amino 
acids and each light chain contains 211 amino acids. There are two cysteines in the hinge region of 
each heavy chain capable of forming inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds. There is one disulfide bond 
forming the covalent attachment between each heavy and light chain.  The heavy and light chain 
amino acid sequences are provided in Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
The light chain contains five cysteines. The intrachain disulfide bridges are between C23 – C87 and 
C131 – C191, with C211 forming the interchain disulfide crosslink with the heavy chain. The interchain 
cysteine conjugation site is shown in bold and underlined. 
Figure 2. Light chain amino acid sequences 
The heavy chain sequence contains 11 cysteines. The intrachain cysteine disulfide bridges are between 
C22 – C96, C147 – C203, C264 – C324, and C370 – C428, with the heavy chain interchain disulfides in 
the hinge region comprised of residues C229 and C232. The heavy-light interchain disulfide is 
composed of the heavy chain residue C223 covalently linked to the C211 residue of the light chain. The 
heavy chain asparagine residue, N300, is post-translationally modified primarily with a complex 
biantennary core-fucosylated oligosaccharide terminated in N-acetyl glucosamines (G0F). The 
N-glycosylation site is shown in italic, bold, and underlined. The interchain cysteine conjugation site is 
shown in bold and underlined. 
Figure 3. Heavy chain amino acid sequences 
The theoretical light chain molecular weight is approximately 23.0 kilodaltons (kDa) and the theoretical 
heavy chain molecular weight is approximately 49.2 kDa (without N-linked glycosylation). The 
glycosylated heavy chain (with N-linked glycosylation predominantly complex biantennary core-
fucosylated oligosaccharide ending in terminal N-acetyl glucosamines (G0F)) has a theoretical 
molecular weight of 50.7 kDa. The average molecular weight of intact RB4v1.2 is approximately 147.3 
kDa with predominantly N-linked glycosylation G0F on each heavy chain and cyclisation of the

N-terminal glutamine in the heavy chain to pyroglutamic acid. Complete characterisation including 
elucidation of higher-order structure is presented in Section 3.2.S.3.1 RB4v1.2. 
2.4.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Loncastuximab is manufactured and tested by appropriately authorised sites.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of loncastuximab is composed of an upstream cell culture process resulting 
in the harvest of the cell culture fluid containing loncastuximab and a downstream purification and 
formulation process resulting in the purified antibody. 
The process is typical for monoclonal antibody and involves upstream cell culture process and 
downstream purification process.  Sufficiently detailed information on buffers used in downstream 
process were provided. Bioburden-control filtrations (0.2 µm filtrations) occur between several of these 
steps. Reprocessing is not allowed. Refiltration is only allowed in the event of a failed post-use integrity 
test and/or loss of system integrity (bag leak or tubing rupture).   
Virus reduction is achieved with three validated virus inactivation or removal steps. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the 
establishment of cell substrate. 
The generation of cell line and cell banking system is generally adequately described. RB4v1.2 is a 
humanised monoclonal antibody of the IgG1, kappa isotype with specific binding to human CD19. 
RB4v1.2 was derived from the murine anti-CD19 antibody B4 and was humanised by a process called 
resurfacing and typical molecular engineering procedures. The resulting expression construct sequence 
is presented in the dossier – presentation of the development of expression vector is found sufficient.  
A two-tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of 
MCB and WCB and release of future WCBs.  
Genotypic characterisation and testing of the cell banks is in line with ICH Q5D and ICH Q5A. Cell bank 
storage is adequately addressed. A description how stability of the cell banks is routinely monitored 
was included in the dossier. The requirements for establishment and qualification (retesting scheme 
with acceptance criteria) of future new WCB were also provided. A summary of analytical methods 
used to characterise and test MCB and WCBs has been provided. 
Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit of cell age according to 
ICHQ5D. Based on the data, it was concluded that the inserted gene of interest shows consistent gene 
copy number; relevant results were provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the loncastuximab manufacturing process was provided. Acceptable information has been 
provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing 
process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. 
Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. Potential CPPs identified using the Risk Assessment 
(FMEA) were studied and characterised using a combination of multivariate design of experiments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 18/157 
 
 
 
(DoE) and one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approaches to determine the impact of variations of selected 
process parameters. The outcome of these studies was used to define the list of CPP and respective 
normal operating ranges (NOR) and proven acceptable ranges (PAR). 
PPs and CMAs are controlled by NORs and PARs, non-CPPs are controlled by set points target ranges or 
PARs, and IPCs are controlled by acceptable ranges or action limits. Provided definitions of parameters 
are in line with ICHQ8. There are no intermediates isolated during the loncastuximab manufacturing 
process.  
The control strategy comprises of routine control measure and also process validation and process 
verification through lifecycle management. It also considers non-critical quality attributes and process 
performance. The control strategy is acceptable. 
Process validation 
The process validation strategy for loncastuximab is based on a traditional approach that includes the 
process design, process qualification stage and continued process verification. The applicant presented 
data for process parameters for upstream and downstream process. Process parameters were within 
acceptable ranges with exception of justified and discussed deviations. The approach generally 
conforms to the guideline EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014. The overall approach to validation is 
acceptable. Consistency in production has been shown 3 full scale commercial batches. All acceptance 
criteria for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests 
are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces loncastuximab of 
reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance 
criteria.  
Final filter validation data is presented. Bacterial challenge study results, compatibility study results, 
extractables study results, specific bubble point study results are provided and can be accepted. 
Maximum hold times applied to various steps have been sufficiently validated and justified. Chemical 
and biological stability was confirmed. 
The lifetime of resins used in the manufacture of loncastuximab was evaluated. Each resin will be 
concurrently validated for use in the loncastuximab commercial manufacturing process for a defined 
number of cycles.  
Results of qualification demonstrated that during transport, the shipping container temperature is 
maintained and container integrity is preserved. No impact to the quality of the mAb intermediate of 
the shipment conditions from mAb manufacturing site to the conjugation has been confirmed with 
data.  
Overall the applicant has provided data to assure that the manufacturing process is appropriately 
validated and can produce loncastuximab batches of consistent quality. The manufacturing process has 
been validated adequately. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development programme.  
Toxicology and clinical batches have been manufactured by four processes. Development sites and 
scale-up has been presented. Process C is the current and validated commercial scale manufacturing 
process and also the process used for PPQ batches and clinical trial batches. 
The development of the cell line was sufficiently described.  
The upstream process steps remained almost the same for all four processes; some scale and site 
changes resulted in differences of operational parameters between processes. The downstream process 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 19/157 
 
 
 
steps were the same for the four processes. Development, processes descriptions and changes 
between manufacturing processes are transparently described in sufficient detail. 
For each change, a comparability study has been carried out demonstrating that, apart from some 
expected differences e.g. in glycosylation, the change did not have a significant influence on the 
quality of the product.  
Comprehensive comparability studies between materials derived from different processes throughout 
development has been conducted. The provided comparability data and batch data are sufficient to 
conclude that batches from different processes are of comparable quality. It has been sufficiently 
justified that any differences seen do not impact the final conclusion of the comparability study.  Finally 
a comprehensive comparability study between materials derived from previous process and 
commercial process material has been conducted. The study included comparative side-by-side release 
testing and extended characterisation; comparative forced degradation studies, comparison of cell 
binding. Description of analytical methods is provided, quality attributes chosen for comparability 
testing are appropriate. All of the comprehensive analytical data obtained during these comparison 
studies are corroborative, and support the conclusion that loncastuximab manufactured by the 
commercial process is similar to that from the latest previous process. Comparability exercise is in 
principle in line with ICHQ5E and the results are found to be comparable.  
Overall, the development and comparability data is found acceptable. 
Characterisation 
Loncastuximab has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art 
methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a humanised monoclonal 
IgG1-type antibody (mAb). The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. 
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size 
and charge variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. Biological 
characterisation of loncastuximab indicates that this antibody has the ability to bind to human CD19 
with high affinity and to specifically bind to Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) binding activity as expected for 
a typical IgG1 mAb.  
Thus, the primary quality attribute of the loncastuximab portion of the ADC is antigen binding. 
Loncastuximab tesirine has negligible effector function activity – ADCC and CDC methods were used to 
characterise potential immunological properties. The cytotoxicity assay was also used to characterise 
the direct cell killing activity of the antibody.  
Adequate and sufficient raw data (chromatograms, results) was provided. Data on qualification of 
analytical methods used for characterisation, showing these are qualified for intended use are 
provided. 
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule.   
Assessment of process-related impurities through manufacturing process validation and intermediate 
testing demonstrated that these impurities do not pose a safety risk. The loncastuximab manufacturing 
process has been shown to have a robust capability to effectively and consistently remove process-
related impurities. For product related proteins (HMW, charge variants, LMW) no significant changes 
were seen through the downstream manufacturing process. This is acceptable. The clearance of 
process-related impurities was consistent across the validation batches with loncastuximab meeting all 
batch release specifications. Impurity testing of commercial scale batches has confirmed that these 
impurities are present at low, consistent levels, and in most cases below the detection or quantitation 
limit.  
Product-related impurities such as size variants, charge variants, high molecular weight and low 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 20/157 
 
 
 
 
molecular weight species are controlled through loncastuximab specification. The levels of HMW (dimer 
and aggregates) and fragments are consistently low.  
In-process testing and specification ensure control over potential contaminants and adventitious 
agents.  
The analytical procedures used to test in-process samples for absence of impurities together with 
qualification status are adequately described in the dossier. 
2.4.2.2.3.  Specification 
The Loncastuximab (RB4v1.2) intermediate specification includes tests for quality, strength, potency, 
identity, purity and impurities, and safety.  
The overall approach to establish and justify the commercial specifications for loncastuximab was 
based on the knowledge gained from process development and product characterisation studies thus 
covering the relevant QAs and are in line with ICH Q6B, EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 and Ph. Eur. 
and is acceptable. The specifications will be re-evaluated after enough commercial lots are 
manufactured to provide statistical power for robust analyses. 
Analytical methods 
The in-house analytical methods were sufficiently described and validated in accordance with ICH Q2 
and compendial methods were qualified. The applicant provided full validation reports and method 
transfers reports. 
Potency of the antibody relative to the reference standard is controlled by a cell-based binding 
immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection.  
Reference standards 
A historical overview of the reference standards was presented. Detailed information on the current 
and previous reference standard lots has been provided. A two-tiered reference standard programme 
was established from lots representative of production and clinical materials to ensure consistency and 
continuity of the loncastuximab quality. A protocol for the qualification and characterisation of future 
primary and working reference standards is included. 
Batch analysis data 
Batch release data were presented for PPQ batches manufactured according to the intended 
commercial manufacturing process. In addition, release data were presented for developmental 
batches manufactured according to the previous processes. All the batches comply with the pre-
established specifications valid at the time of testing and demonstrate consistent quality of 
loncastuximab. The batch release data shows consistent and comparable quality of loncastuximab 
manufactured with different processes.  
Container closure system 
The packaging material for the monoclonal antibody has been sufficiently described and is acceptable.   
2.4.2.2.4.  Stability  
Batches manufactured with the commercial process, and batches from earlier processes were placed 
on stability at the following storage conditions: long-term condition: ≤ -60°C; accelerated condition: -5 
± 3°C; stressed condition: 25 ± 2°C (60 ± 5% RH). At real time storage conditions, the stability data 
is available for up to 36 months for commercial process batches. The stability programme is in 
accordance with ICHQ5C. Stability batches were packaged in the proposed closure system.

Samples were tested for quality (appearance, colour/clarity, pH), protein concentration, potency, 
purity and impurities. There were no significant changes or trends observed in samples stored under 
long-term and accelerated condition in the quality attributes throughout the study period, including key 
stability indicating assays. The results meet their specification in each case.  
Samples stored under stressed condition demonstrated changes in several parameters but results 
demonstrated no change in the binding activity of RB4v1.2.  
A freeze-thaw (F/T) stress study was conducted on a RB4v1.2 mAb development batch. Three cycles of 
F/T were performed. The results of the F/T samples were compared to those of the control sample 
which were taken from release testing. Even after an extended storage at the long-term storage 
condition, all results of the F/T samples were comparable to test results of the control sample. 
There were no significant changes observed in the quality attributes throughout the study period and 
the results meet their specification intended for the long-term condition.Overall, the provided stability 
data support the proposed shelf-life at the recommended storage condition, in the proposed container 
closure system. 
2.4.2.3.  Active substance - loncastuximab tesirine (antibody-drug conjugate) 
2.4.2.3.1.  General information 
Loncastuximab tesirine (also referred as ADCT-402) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of 
a CD19-specific humanised IgG1 kappa isotype mAb, RB4v1.2, conjugated through interchain cysteine 
residues to drug-linker SG3249. The drug-linker SG3249 is comprised of a maleimide linker, a PEG8 
spacer, a protease sensitive valine-alanine linker (Val-Ala dipeptide), para-aminobenzyl carbamate 
(PABC) and the active drug molecule SG3199 that is the PBD dimer drug.  RB4v1.2 mAb is produced 
recombinantly, utilising a mammalian cell line. Briefly, RB4v1.2 mAb comprises two heavy chains (449 
amino acids each) and two light chains (211 amino acids each). There is an expected N-linked 
glycosylation site at Asparagine 300 in each heavy chain. There are 5 cysteine residues in each light 
chain (LC) and 11 cysteines in each heavy chain (HC), and a total of 32 cysteine residues in the 
antibody, forming 16 disulfide bonds per molecule.  
The chemical name of ADCT-402  is Immunoglobulin Gl, (anti-(human CD19 antigen)) (humanised 
clone RB4vl.2 γl-chain), disulfide with humanised clone RB4vl.2 κ-chain, dimer, bis (thioether) with N-
(31-(2, 5-dihydro-2, 5-dioxo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1, 29-dioxo-4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25-octaoxa-28-

Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacturing of loncastuximab tesirine comprises the following steps: thawing and dispensing; 
antibody pooling and transfer; pH adjustment; antibody reduction; conjugation and quenching; 
purification and formulation. The batch size has been clearly stated. The manufacturing process is 
described in sufficient detail. Critical process parameters have been identified by a FMEA study the was 
performed to assess the risk associated with the execution of the conjugation process for RB4v1.2 mAb 
with SG3249; the FMEA was executed in a manner that was consistent with ICH Q9. Detailed 
information is provided on the control of the process. Input and process operating ranges (NORs and 
PARs) are clearly listed, amounts of added solution are included. The loncastuximab tesirine 
manufacturing process is a well-controlled process. Hold-times are also provided. 
Sufficiently detailed information on buffers used is provided. Reprocessing/re-filtration is not declared. 
Bioburden-control filtrations (0.2-µm filtrations) occur after several steps (quenching, UF/DF, 
formulation). The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process. Adequate 
information about the filters used for ultrafiltration/diafiltration, and 0.2-μm sterile filtration was 
provided.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy is described as set of parameters and controls. A comprehensive description of the 
control strategy including in-process tests/controls, critical process parameters and critical material 
attributes, control of process buffers and solutions, and in-process pool hold times employed during 
manufacture of loncastuximab tesirine to ensure that process performance and product quality are 
maintained has been provided; the definitions of PARs and CPPs follow ICH Q8. The CQAs were 
identified in line with ICH Q8, Pharmaceutical Development guideline and ICH Q9.  
The potential CPPs for the loncastuximab tesirine manufacturing process were evaluated or 
characterised through process characterisation studies designed to identify the final list of CPPs. Scale-
down models’ qualification data is provided. Results of these small-scale studies - process 
characterisation studies - supporting the process risk assessment are provided. The impact of 
investigated CPPs on a chosen CQAs is shown and evaluated (in graphic format with plots too). List of 
CPPs together with NORs has been included for all steps. The identified CPPs are typical for conjugation 
process. The test procedures are appropriately qualified. Actions foreseen in case NORs excursions 
were also described. 
The control strategy comprises of routine control measure and also process validation and process 
verification through lifecycle management. The control strategy also considers non-critical quality 
attributes and process performance.  
In summary, the control strategy was developed on principles of ICH Q11, is clearly set out in 
sufficient detail and consistently described and is thus satisfactory. 
Process validation 
The process validation strategy for loncastuximab tesirine is based on a traditional approach that 
includes the process design, process validation stage and continued process verification.  
Consecutive PPQ batches were used to produce material for clinical programme and for commercial 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 24/157 
 
 
 
use. All PPQ batches were manufactured with use of antibody from the commercial process. The 
manufacturing process was qualified at the commercial scale.  
All performance parameters results were within their respective acceptable ranges, in-process controls 
were within acceptance criteria, final AS batches met release specification requirements. No deviations 
for parameters that were outside of acceptable ranges or release specification were reported. The 
results for the PPQ batches, along with an evaluation against the pre-defined acceptance criteria 
support the commercial scale manufacturing process. 
Several additional validation studies were performed concerning specific steps of the process; results 
and range of these studies are acceptable. The approach conforms to the guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014 and is acceptable. Overall, the applicant has provided data to assure 
that the manufacturing process is appropriately validated and can produce AS batches of consistent 
quality.  
Manufacturing process development 
The applicant clearly described the development of the manufacturing processes. Loncastuximab 
tesirine is commercially manufactured according to the current Process. This active substance was the 
active ingredient in the product used in the late phase clinical trials.  
A comprehensive comparability study between materials derived from the different processes used 
throughout development has been conducted. The provided comparability data and batch data are 
sufficient to conclude that batches from different processes are comparable.  Any observed differences 
have been justified and do not affect the conclusion that batches from different processes are 
comparable.  A comprehensive comparability study between materials derived from previous process 
and the commercial process material has been also conducted. No significant differences were 
observed. Some minor differences were observed but the impact assessment performed concluded that 
these minor differences have no impact on the biological activity of the AS nor in the safety and 
efficacy of the AS. Comparability exercise is in principle in line with ICHQ5E. All of the analytical data 
obtained during these comparability studies are corroborative and support the conclusion that 
loncastuximab tesirine manufactured in the commercial process  is similar to that from earlier 
processes.  
Overall, process control strategy development and comparability data is found acceptable. 
Characterisation 
The aim of the structural characterisation was to confirm the primary structure and the higher order 
structure of loncastuximab tesirine. Additionally, the molecule heterogeneity was defined and 
characterised. Various orthogonal analytical techniques were used to characterise the primary 
structure, carbohydrate structure, mass heterogeneity, drug load distribution, disulfide bridge patterns, 
size heterogeneity, charge heterogeneity, biological functions and degradation pathways. Adequate 
and sufficient raw data (chromatograms, results) were provided. The side-by-side characterisation of 
AS and the source antibody intermediate mAb was also performed to evaluate the impact of 
conjugation on the physicochemical and biological activities of the antibody. The final CQAs of 
loncastuximab tesirine were presented in characterisation section together with their control strategy. 
The choice of the characterisation analytical methods for the ADC is adequate. 
The molecular weight and drug load distribution were confirmed. All conjugate species were confirmed  
at the expected target conjugation sites. No off-target conjugation was detected.  
The N-linked glycosylation profile of the AS was confirmed and is consistent with that of the mAb 
intermediate material so it was properly concluded that the AS manufacturing process doesn’t impact 
the glycosylation profile of the intermediate mAb. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022

The amino acid sequence of loncastuximab in the AS was verified. The structural integrity of 
loncastuximab tesirine was further demonstrated by disulfide bonds analysis.  
Molecular size variants were characterised through orthogonal methods.  
The charge heterogeneity was sufficiently (quantitatively) assessed. Batch analysis demonstrated 
consistency of this quality attribute. 
A set of suitable characterisation methods was applied to evaluate the higher order structure of 
loncastuximab tesirine. 
The only known mechanism of action of loncastuximab tesirine is to target through loncastuximab 
binding and kill CD19-expressing malignant B-cells through PBD-induced cytotoxicity. Loncastuximab 
tesirine has negligible effector function activity. The cytotoxicity potency assay was used to 
characterise the direct cell killing activity of the antibody.  
The final method for antigen binding potency is a cell-based competitive ECLIA assay format. Relative 
binding potency of DS is measured through competitive binding to CD19. These cytotoxicity and 
antigen binding assays are relative potency assays based on dose response curves of the reference 
standard.  
Evaluation of MoA and effector functions and development of potency assays is sufficient. 
Loncastuximab tesirine samples were exposed to stress conditions to evaluate the potential 
degradation pathways and stability-indicating properties of analytical methods. The AS shows potential 
increases in aggregation, fragmentation, acidic variants, degradation of drug-linker and increase of 
free drug species. The changes on the antibody don’t significantly impact the antigen binding potency. 
The degradation of drug-linker was determined and it is concluded that the linker hydrolysis doesn’t 
impact cytotoxicity, but other degradations of drug-linker potentially reduce the cytotoxicity of AS.  
Finally the stability indicating character of the methods used was demonstrated in line with ICHQ5C. 
Data on qualification of analytical methods used for characterisation, showing these are qualified for 
intended use are provided. 
Overall, the characterisation of loncastuximab tesirine is adequate for this type of molecule. 
Process-related impurities are introduced into the AS process either directly or from the antibody and 
drug linker. Any impurities originating from the intermediates that are of potential concern are 
controlled in the manufacturing processes of the intermediates. Product-related impurities are 
controlled in the AS specification. 
A risk assessment was performed for evaluation of extractables and leachables on all product 
contacting material used during manufacturing process. All identified compounds were determined to 
be either below the AET, below the identified substance PDE or below the TTC. 
In-process testing and AS specification ensure control over potential contaminants and adventitious 
agents.  
2.4.2.3.3.  Specification 
The Loncastuximab tesirine active substance specification includes tests for identity, quantity, purity, 
potency, and microbial safety.  
The proposed list of tests included in the loncastuximab tesirine specification cover identity, quantity, 
purity, potency, and microbial safety. Overall, the list of tests is in line with ICH Q6A, ICH Q6B, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 26/157 
 
 
 
 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 and Ph. Eur. The overall approach to establish and justify the 
commercial specifications for loncastuximab tesirine were based on reference and compendial 
requirements, the knowledge gained from process development and product characterisation studies. 
The proposed limits have been revised during the procedure and are considered justified and 
acceptable.  
All analytical procedures used for AS release and shelf-life analysis have been well described. In-house 
methods have been reliably validated in accordance with ICH Q2 and compendial methods were 
qualified.  
Batch analysis data has been provided for batches used throughout development, toxicological, clinical 
studies and PPQ batches. All batches were within specification and the data is consistent across 
manufacturing runs. A two-tiered reference standard programme was established from lots 
representative of production and clinical materials to ensure consistency and continuity of the 
loncastuximab tesirine quality.  
Preparation and qualification of the current working reference standard as well as new primary 
reference standard are provided. PRS and WRS are well-characterised and qualified by testing 
according to the release specification and extensive structural characterisation tests. A summary of the 
qualification strategy for future primary and working reference standards are included in the dossier. 
The packaging material for the AS has been sufficiently described and is acceptable. The applicant 
declares in the dossier that container fulfils Ph. Eur. standards. 
2.4.2.3.4.  Stability 
The primary stability study comprises batches manufactured with commercial process  batches; 
supportive stability batches include batches representative for earlier processes. All batches were 
placed on stability at the following storage conditions: long-term condition: ≤ -60°C; accelerated 
condition: 5 ± 3°C; stressed condition: 25 ± 2°C /60 ± 5% RH.  At real time storage conditions, the 
stability data is available for up to 24 months for commercial process batches and for up to 36 months 
for earlier process batches. Stability batches were packaged in the proposed closure system. The 
stability programme is in accordance with ICHQ5C. 
In the samples stored under long-term and accelerated condition, there were no changes or trends 
observed in the quality attributes throughout the study period including stability indicating methods.  
The results of all methods meet their specification in each case. The results meet their specification in 
each case and are consistent between primary and supportive batches.  
Samples stored under stressed condition demonstrated changes similar to the supportive lots with 
changes in certain test parameters. The results were consistent between primary and supportive 
batches. 
A photostability study was performed on a primary stability, commercial scale, batch to determine the 
effect of light intensity, as specified in ICH Q1B (option 2). Results indicate that that ADCT-402 is 
negatively impacted by light when directly exposed to the level as specified in ICH Q1B (option 2), 
which is significantly more light compared to room light during manufacturing operations, leading to 
major degradation which is detected by almost all test methods. In addition, test results of the dark 
control suggest that ADCT-402 is sensitive to the heat generated in the photostability chamber. 
Therefore, it is recommended that ADCT-402 AS be protected from long-term exposure to light during 
storage. 
A freeze-thaw (F/T) study was performed on a primary stability, commercial scale, batch to determine 
the impact of temperature cycling on the quality of ADCT-402. The results demonstrated that there are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 27/157 
 
 
 
no significant changes or trends no impact to product quality when ADCT-402 underwent three cycles 
of F/T. 
The proposed shelf-life and storage conditions are supported by real-time stability data and are 
acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402) finished product (FP), 10 mg/vial powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion, is a sterile, white to off-white lyophilised, preservative-free cake or powder in a 
single-use vial for reconstitution. Loncastuximab tesirine is administered as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion.  
In the composition of the applied product only compendial excipients are used and are controlled in 
line with respective Ph.Eur. monograph. An overfill is implemented to ensure that the labelled amount 
of the active ingredient is applied. 
Loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402) finished product has the same formulation as ADCT-402 active 
substance. The active ingredient (loncastuximab tesirine [ADCT-402]) is formulated at 5.0 mg/mL with 
the excipient’s histidine, sucrose and polysorbate 20. Properties of each used excipient have been 
briefly described.  The formulation used in the early clinical development (Phase 1) and during Phase 2 
clinical studies have been described. The suitability of the lyophilised formulation was tested as a liquid 
aqueous formulation as well as a lyophilised formulation. Two studies evaluated the robustness of the 
formulation by modifying excipient concentrations and pH during accelerated stability studies. The pH 
of the formulation was optimised to achieve a good balance between competing degradation 
mechanisms. In general, sucrose was identified as a stabilising formulation component with higher 
concentrations providing better stability. It was concluded from the lyophilised stability study that 
there is minimal degradation after lyophilisation. Challenges of storage and shipment of this type of 
product necessitated the development of a lyophilised formulation. Comparability between lyophilised 
powder and frozen liquid formulations and the corresponding AS and FP manufacturing processes was 
demonstrated and discussed in the dossier. 
The applicant has presented a narrative history of the manufacturing process and associated 
development studies. A risk assessment was performed on each process parameter in order to 
determine parameter criticality. CPPs have been presented in a tabular summary for each process 
step, together with normal operating ranges were given; this is acceptable.  
The development of container closure system (CCS) has been presented and updated during the 
procedure. It has been stated that the Type I glass vial, rubber stopper, and flip-off cap container-
closure configuration is designed to maintain a sterile product and prevent microbial contamination. 
Detailed discussion of the extractables and leachables studies for the CCS has been provided. 
Container and extractable volume test have been performed to demonstrate that the required volume 
can be delivered.  A compatibility study for ADCT-402 was performed. It has been concluded that if the 
FP reconstituted solution is compatible with the evaluated material type, the use of all commercially 
available materials in that category may be allowed. 
Dose solutions with different concentrations were prepared in IV bags. No significant changes in 
product quality attributes were observed for loncastuximab tesirine FP from either a clinical lot or a 
commercial lot after 4 hours’ storage at both 5°C and 25°C post-reconstitution as reflected in SmPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 28/157 
 
 
 
section 6.3. Different diluents were evaluated for loncastuximab tesirine administration. The data 
confirmed compatibility of the applied product only with D5W and this is reflected in SmPC section 6.6.  
In-line filter is referred as required in the dossier and was part of the compatibility studies. ADCT-402 
is compatible with PES in-line filter. Zynlonta must be administered using a dedicated infusion 
equipped with a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding in-line or add-on filter (0.2 or 0.22 
micrometre pore size) and catheter).  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Finished product manufacture and quality control testing are performed at appropriately authorised 
site. The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: Thawing of the active substance, 
pooling and mixing of BDS, sterile filtration, aseptic filling and partial stoppering, lyophilisation, 
crimping, external vial washing, visual inspection, vial Labelling and secondary packaging.   
A detailed description of manufacturing process has been presented including proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) for each CPP. Analytical methods used during IPC have been described and validated.  
The batch size has been clearly stated. Process validation data (PPQ) have been presented for 
commercial scale batches. The PPQ results met acceptance criteria predetermined for each process 
step. Validation of holding time is acceptable as is the transport validation data. Overall, the presented 
data demonstrates that the manufacturing process is well-controlled and capable of consistently 
producing FP that meets the acceptance criteria. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and end of shelf-life specification, includes tests for general quality 
parameters, strength, potency, identity, purity and impurities, and safety. The specification was set in 
accordance with ICH Q6B. AS and FP data were pooled to establish acceptance criteria. This is justified 
since AS and FP have identical composition. Overall, the proposed specification is acceptable. The 
impurities that are present in the FP are primarily identical to the impurities in the AS. However, 
additional investigations with respect to potential FP impurities were performed. Elemental impurities 
testing and risk assessment was performed per the ICH Q3D (R1) guideline. Elemental impurities to be 
considered for parenteral applications plus those metals considered potential issues based on the 
equipment of manufacture were tested in the three batches of the FP. Extractable and leachable 
studies were performed on manufacturing components, storage containers and final container closure 
system. No reportable compounds were found in the simulated leachable study. Overall, no risks have 
been identified.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
initially performed and updated during the procedure in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). The data presented are acceptable. 
Based on this information it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary. The analytical methods for the FP that are also used for the 
AS testing are described above. The product-specific, non-compendial analytical methods used for 
batch release and stability were validated consistent with ICH Q2 (R1). Compendial methods used for 
batch release and stability testing of the FP were verified in compliance with the requirements defined 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 29/157 
 
 
 
in each method compendial monograph. Reference standards are identical for FPS and AS; this is 
acceptable. 
Batch analysis data have been presented. Batch data were also presented for batches manufactured as 
frozen formulation. All batches were within specification and the data is consistent across 
manufacturing runs. 
The finished product is packaged in clear Type 1 glass vial closed with a stopper (teflon-coated 
rubber), with an aluminium seal with plastic flip-off cap. Specifications and representative certificates 
of analyses for each element of primary packaging has been presented. The outer packaging consists 
of a cardboard carton. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The primary stability study comprises  commercial scale batches stored under long term conditions 
(5 ± 3°C) for up to 24 months, accelerated (25°C / 60% RH) for up to 6 months and under stressed 
conditions (40°C / 75% RH) for three months. Stability batches were packaged in the proposed closure 
system. The stability programme is in accordance with ICHQ5C. 
In addition supportive stability data has been provided for development batches stored for up to 48 
months under the same long term conditions, for six months under accelerated and 3 months under 
stressed conditions. Based on the accepted comparability exercise, the supportive batches are 
considered as comparable to the commercial batches.  
There were no changes or trends observed in the quality attributes throughout the study period under 
the long term conditions. The results comply with the specification for both primary and supportive 
batches. 
Primary stability batches under accelerated conditions were also consistent with the supportive stability 
data exhibiting no significant changes for any of the stability tests except for an increasing trend in 
moisture content (but still within the specification limits) when stored for 6 months at the accelerated 
storage condition. 
A thermal cycling study was performed on a primary PPQ batch to evaluate the impact of repeated 
thermal stress on the FP. Based on the temperature cycling stability data obtained from the study, 
there was no impact to product quality when loncastuximab tesirine lyophilised product underwent 
three cycles of thermal stress. No significant changes were observed in any quality attributes outside 
of method variability when compared to results of the control sample. 
A photostability study was performed on a primary PPQ batch to determine the effect of light intensity, 
as specified in ICH Q1B (option 2). Based on the results, it is concluded that FP is negatively impacted 
by light when a naked vial is directly exposed to the level as specified in ICH Q1B (option 2) leading to 
major degradation which is detected by almost all test methods. However, the effect of light exposure 
on the quality of product when packaged in a carton (without a label or insert) was only minimal and 
met all specifications, indicating the package offers protection of the loncastuximab tesirine FP from 
exposure to intense light. The commercial package which includes a label and insert would further 
protect the drug product from light exposure. 
The compatibility/clinical in-use study results exhibited acceptable stability post-reconstitution, 
compatibility, in use stability and recovery of dose solutions. Furthermore, loncastuximab tesirine FP 
did not promote microbial growth, which supports storage for 8 hours at room temperature and up to 
24 hours in total. The in-use stability recommendation as stated in the SmPC section 6.3 are supported 
by data and are considered acceptable. 
Assessment report

Taken together, the presented stability data sufficiently support a shelf life of 3 years and the proposed 
storage conditions “Store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C)”, “Do not freeze”, “Keep the vial in the outer 
carton in order to protect from light” + as stated in SmPC section 6.3 and 6.4.  
2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocols 
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP), developed per 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010 has been submitted for the addition of a new manufacturer. 
Upon completion of the agreed PACMP and demonstration of comparability, it is proposed that the 
implementation will be submitted under the relevant variation category; this is accepted. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Controlled sourcing of raw materials is the primary defence against introducing causative agents of TSE 
and BSE in the manufacturing process. The use of animal materials (no animal derived materials 
except cell line) is compliant with the effective version of EMA/410/01. Intermediates, AS and FP 
therefore pose minimal/negligible risk for transmission of TSE and BSE. 
Extensive testing for endogenous and adventitious viral agents has been conducted for the expression 
cell lines, MCBs and WCBs and EOPCB to ensure that the cell banks are free from detectable 
adventitious viral contamination. 
Bulk harvest is tested for the absence of mycoplasma, adventitious viruses (using several in vitro virus 
assay indicator cell clines) and minute virus of mice (MVM). This is in line with ICHQ5A. 
Bulk testing is performed on the production bioreactor as an in-process control during production of 
each lot confirmation of the presence of infectious adventitious agent will lead to lot rejection. The 
loncastuximab purification process includes several steps for virus reduction. Overall, these data 
support the viral safety of Zynlonta for commercial use is according to ICHQ5A. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The AS loncastuximab tesirine is a human (CD19)-targeted 
antibody drug conjugate, consisting of a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa monoclonal 
antibody specific for human CD19 (RB4v1.2 mAb), conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer 
cytotoxic drug via a linker. During the procedure, two MOs were raised on the suitability of the starting 
materials used in the synthesis of the tesirine. Both MOs were resolved by provision of additional 
information supporting the selected starting materials or redefining them as appropriate. Detailed and 
satisfactory information has been presented for all three components of the AS. The finished product 
has the same formulation as the AS. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to updating the manufacturing process of 
SG3249 for Step1 and Step 2 and are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- 
to submit post-approval variation including final control strategy and batch analysis, the 
requested manufacturing process updates and the requested starting material specifications 
updates. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Loncastuximab tesirine (designated as ADCT
402 or RB4v1.2
SG3249) is an antibody
drug conjugate 
(ADC) with an established pharmacologic class of CD19
directed antibody and alkylating agent 
‐
conjugate.  The humanised antibody component (RB4v1.2) of loncastuximab tesirine is an IgG1 kappa 
‐
‐
‐
isotype.  The antibody is conjugated (at the inter
chain cysteine residues) to a protease cleavable 
valine
alanine linker
payload designated as SG3249 (tesirine). 
‐
SG3249 contains the payload SG3199, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxic agent, a para
‐
‐
aminobenzyl carbamate (PABC) moiety, and a maleimide polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. PBD 
‐
monomers bind in the DNA minor groove and form a single covalent aminal linkage to the exocyclic N2 
amino group of guanine within purine
guanine
purine sequences. PBDs are a class of naturally 
occurring anti-tumour antibiotics found in Streptomyces spp. PBD dimers, obtained by joining two PBD 
‐
‐
monomers together via an appropriate polymethylene tether, have the ability to produce two covalent 
bonds forming highly cytotoxic DNA interstrand cross
links.   
Cluster of differentiation (CD) 19 is a 95 kilodalton (kDa) type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging 
‐
to the immunoglobulin Ig super family. It is expressed on all types of B-lymphocytes except plasma 
cells, thereby representing a potentially attractive target for treatment of B-cell leukaemia or non-
Hodgkin lymphomas of B-cell origin. Expression of CD19 is maintained in hematologic B-cell 
malignancies, including leukaemias (pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [pre-B ALL], B ALL, hairy 
cell leukaemia and NHLs (Burkitt’s lymphoma], follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Loncastuximab tesirine binds to cell surface CD19 and is internalised. Once inside the cell, the 
cytotoxic drug (SG3199) is released, forming DNA crosslinks and leading to cell death. The submitted 
pharmacology studies suggest CD19 binding and expression is an important determinant for the 
cytotoxic activity of loncastuximab tesirine. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) component of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 32/157 
 
 
 
loncastuximab tesirine, RB4v1.2, is selective for human CD19 and not cross
reactive with CD19 from 
any nonclinical species. 
‐
The primary pharmacology studies included in vitro cell binding studies, in vitro cytotoxicity studies 
using CD19-positive human cell lines and in vivo tumour growth inhibition studies using several CD19-
positive xenograft murine models. The applicant has presented a number of aspects regarding the 
biology of CD19 and mode-of-action of ADCT-402, the preclinical models used, and the translation of 
the nonclinical data to the clinical setting to provide sufficient evidence of the validity of the preclinical 
evaluation of ADCT-402. The nonclinical studies conducted with ADCT-402 using a panel of cell lines 
derived from lymphoma and leukaemia patients have supported the clinical testing of loncastuximab 
tesirine in patients. Findings from these nonclinical studies support the use of cancer cell lines for 
nonclinical studies with ADCs. PBD-based ADCs have shown potent and specific activity, in vitro and in 
vivo, in cancer cell lines and in primary patient samples, including primary paediatric samples. In both 
cell lines and patient-derived material, PBD-based ADCs have shown activity across the entire 
cytogenetic risk spectrum, different molecular abnormalities and independently from Multiple Drug 
Resistance (MDR) positivity status. 
In vitro studies 
In a flow cytometric analysis, the apparent KD of RB4v1.2 for CD19-positive cell lines was within a 
range of 206 pM – 790 pM and a competitive Ramos cell-based binding assay showed that the relative 
binding of RB4v1.2 and ADCT-402 to cell-bound CD19 were similar, indicating that conjugating 
RB4v1.2 to the drug-linker SG3249 did not alter its binding affinity for CD19. ADCT-402 was shown not 
to be cross-reactive to cynomolgus monkey CD19 expressed on PBMCs in a flow cytometry assay. 
The in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCT-402 was assessed in CD19-positive human cell lines (Daudi, DOHH-2, 
GRANTA-519, MEC-2, NALM-6, NAMALWA, Ramos, and SU-DHL-4). In study No. SIR041 it was 
observed that at the highest concentration of ADCT
402 tested (67 nM), some cell lines appeared to 
retain resistant populations of cells, as evidenced by less than 90% total cell killing. The two CD19-
‐
positive cell lines that had some residual surviving cells when tested with the highest concentration of 
ADCT-402 were Granta 519 and Mec2.  These two cell lines grew in culture as large aggregates of cells 
and had the lowest percentage of single cells. It was noted in the discussion of study No. SIR041 that 
cell growth as aggregates could hinder diffusion of an ADC and reduce exposure to the ADC by the 
cells in the core, thus relatively protecting them from the ADC cytotoxic activity. The phenomenon of 
the presence of some residual surviving Granta 519 and Mec2 cells after exposure to ADCT-402 is 
probably related to the different growth pattern of these two cell lines. 
The single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was used to measure the interstrand cross-links 
induced in the DNA by the released PBD dimer toxin following ADCT-402 binding, internalisation and 
trafficking to the lysosomes. Cross-link formation was dose-dependent and the peak of cross-linking 
occurred between eight to 12 hours after a two-hour exposure of the cells to ADCT-402. ADCT-402 
was shown to moderately target CD19-negative cells in co-culture experiments with CD19-positive and 
CD19-negative cells and to mediate bystander killing of CD19-negative cells via conditioned-medium 
transfer from ADCT-402-treated, CD19-positive cells. The ability of ADCT-402 to induce bystander 
killing of neighbouring CD19-negative tumour cells is of potential benefit for the clinical setting. 
Although CD19 has a broad and homogenous expression profile in the majority of DLBCL and B-cell 
NHL cases, there is a proportion of lymphoma patients with heterogeneous CD19 expression(Masir et 
al., 2006). For these patients, the ability of ADCT-402 to mediate bystander killing of CD19-negative 
tumour cells is expected to be beneficial as it would allow ADCT-402 to kill both CD19-positive and 
CD19-negative tumour cells and at the same time to reduce the chance of relapse via CD19-negative 
clonal expansion. The bystander effect may be a contributor to the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 33/157 
 
 
 
including the durable responses which continue beyond the end of treatment in patients who achieve a 
response. 
In vivo studies 
The in vivo pharmacological activity of ADCT-402 was characterised in immunodeficient mice using two 
human Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) models (Ramos and Daudi), a human DLBCL model (WSU-DLCL-2), a 
disseminated Ramos model and a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia-derived model (NALM-6). 
ADCT-402 was tested in combination with rituximab, a CD20-specific mAb or with the anti-metabolite 
chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine in the WSU-DLCL2 xenograft model and with the pan-class I PI3K 
inhibitor copanlisib in the TMD8 xenograft model. 
ADCT-402 demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumour activity in CD19-positive Burkitt’s and DLBCL-
derived xenograft mouse models. 
In a comparative study involving ADCT-402 and RB4v1.2-DM4 and hBU12-vc-PAB-MMAF, two different 
CD19 targeting ADCs with a tubulin inhibitor as payload, ADCT-402 showed superior anti-tumour 
activity in the Ramos s.c. xenograft model. 
In a disseminated Ramos xenograft mouse model, ADCT-402 caused a significant increase in survival 
compared to both vehicle-treated and isotype control ADC-treated mice when tested as a single-dose 
at 0.33 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacology studies were conducted with ADCT-402 or SG3199. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were conducted with ADCT-402 or SG3199, however, in 
accordance with ICH S6(R1) safety pharmacology endpoints, including neurobehavioural and 
cardiovascular endpoints (8-lead electrocardiogram measurement and blood pressure) and assessment 
of the respiratory rate, were included in the repeat-dose toxicity studies with ADCT-402. There were no 
treatment-related findings. 
Consistent with International Council for Harmonization (ICH) S6(R1), no stand
alone safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted with loncastuximab tesirine, and safety pharmacology endpoints 
were evaluated as part of the GLP
compliant 4
 and/or 13
week repeat
dose toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Parameters evaluated included cardiovascular endpoints (8
lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) [heart rate, RR
, PR
, QT, and QT corrected by Bazett’s formula [QTcB]

interval] and blood pressure), respiratory rate, and neurobehavioral assessments (general assessment

‐
‐
of sensorimotor function and a standard observation battery [modified Irwin]). No loncastuximab 
tesirine
related effects were noted on any endpoint studied. 
‐
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with loncastuximab tesirine. Due to the 
high binding specificity of loncastuximab tesirine to human CD19, a transmembrane protein expressed 
on the surface of cells of B
lineage origin, it is stated to be unlikely that loncastuximab tesirine has 
pharmacodynamic interactions with co-administered drugs.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods were developed to determine ADCT-402, total RB4v1.2 antibody or SG3199 in rat 
and cynomolgus monkey serum or for determination of SG3199 in in vitro metabolism studies. 
Validated methods were used in the GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat and 
cynomolgus monkey. In addition, in order to determine the formation of ADA in cynomolgus monkey 
serum, a validated method was developed. The validations of the analytical methods included: 
determination of assay range, inter-assay and intra-assay precision and accuracy, selectivity, 
specificity, bench top stability, long-term stability, freeze-thaw stability, hook (prozone) effect. The 
studies have all been conducted in test facilities and sites that belong to national compliance programs 
and had been inspected for their GLP compliance in the time of the conductance of the studies. 
The studies are mostly GLP compliant except: 
Study No. 8303115: the phase reports on dosage of RB4V1.2 and RB4V1.2 conjugate state that long-
term stability data were not available to confirm the dosage results at the time of the completion of the 
study. With the response of day 120 the applicant amended the final toxicology study report of Study 
8303115 with the final bioanalysis reports containing the long-term stability data and included a 
statement in the final toxicology study report to indicate that TK parameters determined after the 
second dose are likely impacted by the lack of supporting long term storage stability data and may 
underestimate drug exposure, in particular in the animals assigned to the recovery phase. 
Study No. 8374716: the phase report on dosage of conjugated RB4V1.2 states that long-term stability 
data were not available to confirm the dosage results for concentrations <650 ng/mL. With responses 
to day 120 the applicant submitted additional data. Long-term storage stability data for the conjugate-
specific assay showed that for samples with ADCT-402 conjugate concentrations ≥650 ng/mL storage 
stability at -70°C was 365 days, whilst for samples with ADCT-402 conjugate concentrations <650 
ng/mL storage stability at -70°C of only 105 days. The concentrations <650 ng/mL were defined as For 
Information Purpose Only (FIPO) and were not intended for inclusion in the TK analysis. 
Study No. 8374716: Some of the analysed concentrations for formulations were out of range (below 
LOD), therefore not valid and the analytical method used for those analysis was not validated. The 
applicant was requested to justify why those deviations to GLP do not jeopardise the validity of the 
study. Mean Cmax values for the sexes combined at 0.075, 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg of 2.26, 4.40 and 
10.87 μg/mL following dosing on Day 1, and of 2.80, 5.35 and 10.6 μg/mL demonstrate dose-
dependent exposure over the intended dose range. Dose-related effects such as skin effects, 
nephropathy and testicular changes were observed in toxicology studies. These results indicate the 
correct dosage. 
Absorption studies were not conducted with ADCT-402 or SG3199. All in vivo studies with ADCT-402 or 
SG3199 used the IV route of administration, the intended clinical route of administration for ADCT-
402. 
No distribution studies were conducted with ADCT-402. Given its molecular size, ADCT -402 would be 
expected to be largely confined to the plasma space, similar to the endogenous antibodies and 
monoclonal antibodies. This was confirmed by the TK analyses from 4- and 13 – week repeat dose 
toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, which indicated that the volume of distribution (Vz) was 
generally similar to the plasma volume. 
No metabolism studies were performed on ADCT -402. Monoclonal antibodies are expected to be 
metabolised in the same manner as endogenous antibodies. This is acceptable according to ICHS6(R1). 
In vitro studies indicated that SG3199 is not a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. 
CYP induction studies showed that SG3199 did not induce CYP2B6- or CYP3A4-mediated enzyme 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 35/157 
 
 
 
activity or mRNA expression in human hepatocytes in vitro, whilst a >2-fold increase in CYP1A2 mRNA 
expression (without corresponding increase in enzyme activity) was observed. These data indicate that 
SG3199 is unlikely to induce CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 in vivo and therefore the potential for producing 
clinically relevant CYP induction related drug-drug interactions is considered to be low. However, based 
on the in vitro data SG3199 may be an inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. 
Comparable metabolite profiles were observed upon incubation with rat, cynomolgus monkey or 
human hepatocytes and liver microsomes. Biotransformation by human liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes resulted in ether hydrolysis, amide hydrolysis, various oxygenation biotransformations and 
O-demethylation, or a combination thereof. Results from two approaches to reaction phenotyping 
(recombinant human CYP enzymes and chemical inhibition) indicated potential involvement of 
CYP3A4/5 in the metabolism of SG3199. In addition, based on the extent of substrate loss in the 
absence of NADPH when SG3199 was incubated with human liver microsomes, non-CYP mediated 
metabolism of SG3199 is indicated. 
No nonclinical excretion studies were conducted with the ADCT – 402 antibody part, as it will undergo 
normal protein metabolism. 
Excretion of [3H]-SG3199 was mainly via the faeces, biliary route (97.5±3.0%), with minor urinary 
excretion (3.8±0.3%). Excretion was rapid, with most radioactivity (83.5±5.8%) recovered 24 h post 
dose. 
Loncastuximab tesirine was cleared slowly in animals with the half
life ranging from 8 to 17 days in 
monkeys. Exposures to loncastuximab tesirine generally increased dose proportionally with an increase 
in dose level. There were no major differences in plasma exposure between males and females and no 
‐
evidence of accumulation with repeated dosing. Maximal serum concentrations were generally reached 
within 1.5 hours of dosing. Plasma concentrations were overall comparable between loncastuximab 
tesirine and the monoclonal antibody component, and the level of deconjugated SG3199 was below the 
lower limit of quantitation at most timepoints and dose levels in the 13
week repeat
dose study in 
monkeys.  Plasma stability studies combined with the toxicokinetic data in monkeys suggest the ADC is 
‐
‐
stable and, when free, SG3199 is highly protein bound in rat, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma 
(approximately 97%, 93%, and 94%, respectively).  [3H]
SG3199 distribution was rapid and 
widespread with the majority of tissues reaching maximum radioactivity at 2 hours post dose, the first 
sampling time point.  There was no apparent distribution of SG3199 to melanin
containing tissues or 
 ‐
the brain or spinal cord.  Linear clearance profiles for loncastuximab tesirine were noted across the 
‐
dose range studied (0.075
0.9 mg/kg), indicative of a lack of target
mediated drug disposition (TMDD) 
and consistent with the lack of cross
‐
reactivity of RB4v1.2 to cynomolgus monkey CD19. 
‐
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
‐
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
At single dose 0.5 mg/kg there was no evidence of effects of ADCT-402 on haematology parameters or 
gross  pathology.  The  MTD  for  ADCT-402  in  female  Sprague  Dawley  rats  was  considered  to  be  the  2 
mg/kg dose. 
Single IV doses of 50 or 100 μg/kg SG3199 were not tolerated and associated with adverse clinical 
signs, early terminations and death, and exceeded the MTD in male Sprague Dawley rats.

2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Loncastuximab tesirine
related toxicities were seen in the kidneys, liver, lungs, male reproductive 
organs, organs of the hematopoietic system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, salivary gland, and urinary 
bladder.  Inappetence, body weight loss, and immunosuppression were dose limiting with the ADC in 
‐
rats and skin toxicity (lesions) was dose limiting with the ADC in monkeys.  Liver toxicity (jaundice) in 
rats and inappetence and body weight loss in Beagle dogs were dose limiting for SG3199.  Decreased 
prothrombin time, increased platelets and fibrinogen, and haemorrhage were observed mainly in 
monkeys after repeated doses with loncastuximab tesirine. Minor changes in coagulation parameters 
were observed in rats following repeated doses of SG3199.  Toxicity findings with loncastuximab 
tesirine in monkeys were generally reversible at tolerated doses, except for black spots on the skin and 
the effects on male reproductive organs.  Also present during recovery at low incidence were organ 
haemorrhages and oedema and myocardial degeneration.  Some monkeys with these histopathological 
findings also displayed changes in haematology and clinical pathology parameters associated with 
inflammation. Treatment of monkeys with loncastuximab tesirine resulted in pro
inflammatory 
responses as indicated by increases in the white blood cells (WBCs) and/or differentials, increased 
‐
fibrinogen, and histopathology observations (multi
organ inflammation, particularly the lung, kidney, or 
injection site).  Pro
inflammatory findings with loncastuximab tesirine are consistent with findings in a 
meta
analysis of PBD
containing ADCs. Several of the findings with loncastuximab tesirine were 
‐
‐
‐
observed in studies conducted with the free payload in pilot or GLP toxicology studies. In the 13-week 
toxicity study with ADCT-402 in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 8374716), red discolouration of all lung 
‐
lobes was observed at necropsy in 1 recovery male (P0303). There is no evidence of this being 
associated with fluid build-up in the thoracic cavity during necropsy. This finding correlated with 
increased lung weight, and, in microscopic pathology evaluations, with moderate alveolar 
haemorrhage, without evidence of inflammatory cell infiltration or erythrophagocytosis. Taking into 
account the incidental nature of this finding in a single animal ~90 days after the last ADCT-402 dose 
and also the lack of evidence of tissue repair, and the difference in anatomic location vs pleural 
effusions it seems unlikely that the finding in animal P0303 is representative of pleural effusions as 
seen in individual patients. 
In repeat-dose IV toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, ADCT-402 exhibited linear PK/TK without 
evidence of TMDD, consistent with lack of cross-reactivity to cynomolgus monkey CD19. Exposures 
increased in a dose-proportional manner, with a mean half-life of ~8 to 17 days. 
Due to rapid clearance, SG3199 TK parameters could not be accurately determined, however, based on 
the available data in the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in the rat, systemic exposure upon 
daily IV administration increased with dose, without evidence of gender-related differences or 
accumulation, and a half-life ranging approximately 8 to 41 min. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted with ADCT-402. 
SG3199 was genotoxic in GLP in vitro studies (in vitro micronucleus assay and the chromosome 
aberration assay in human lymphocytes from whole blood). A GLP bacterial reverse mutation assay 
(Ames test) was also conducted; however, mutagenicity could not be assessed due to cytotoxicity at 
all concentrations tested. In pharmacology studies and other toxicity studies, the applicant 
demonstrated that SG3199 crosslinks DNA and causes double strand breaks. The results of these 
studies indicate that loncastuximab tesirine will cause chromosomal damage; therefore, the wait times 
for contraception will be T1/2 (half
life) + three months for males and 5 x T1/2 + six months for 
females after the last dose.

2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S9, ICH S6(R1) and ICH S1A (Guideline on the Need for Carcinogenicity 
Studies of Pharmaceuticals) no carcinogenicity studies were conducted or are planned with ADCT-402 
or SG3199 given the genotoxic mode of action of SG3199 (covalent DNA crosslinking/ alkylating agent) 
and the intended clinical use in patients with advanced cancer. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Given that SG3199 is genotoxic and that ADCT-402/SG3199 target actively dividing cells, in 
accordance with ICH S9 no reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted or are 
planned with ADCT-402 or SG3199. 
Results from repeat
dose toxicity studies with intravenous administration of loncastuximab tesirine in 
cynomolgus monkeys indicate the potential for impaired male reproductive function and fertility. 
‐
Administration of loncastuximab tesirine to cynomolgus monkeys every 3 weeks at 0.6 mg/kg for a 
total of 2 doses, or every 3 weeks at 0.3 mg/kg for 13 weeks resulted in adverse findings that included 
decreased weight and/or size of the testes and epididymis, atrophy of the seminiferous tubules, germ 
cell degeneration, and/or reduced sperm content.  The dose of 0.3 mg/kg in animals results in an 
exposure (AUC) that is approximately 3 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human 
recommended dose [MRHD] of 0.15 mg/kg. These findings were not reversible at the end of the 12
week recovery period following 4 or 13 weeks of dosing.  The animal: human safety margin was 
‐
determined from a human exposure (AUC) of 26,518 day.ng/mL (or 636 hr.µg/mL) at the maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.15 mg/kg every 3 weeks and the Day 43 AUC from the 13
week general toxicology study in monkeys was 1830 hr*µg/mL at 0.3 mg/kg. 
‐
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
In repeat-dose IV toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, ADCT-402 exhibited linear PK/TK without 
evidence of TMDD, consistent with lack of cross-reactivity to cynomolgus monkey CD19. Exposures 
increased in a dose-proportional manner, with a mean half-life of ~8 to 17 days. 
Due to rapid clearance, SG3199 TK parameters could not be accurately determined, however, based on 
the available data in the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in the rat, systemic exposure upon 
daily IV administration increased with dose, without evidence of gender-related differences or 
accumulation, and a half-life ranging approximately 8 to 41 min. 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance upon IV administration of ADCT-402 was evaluated as part of repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  
No standalone local tolerance studies were conducted with SG3199, and injection sites were evaluated 
as part of single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in Sprague Dawley rats. 
Findings in the pivotal 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study of ADCT-402 included dose-related black 
skin discoloration, which correlated microscopically with minimal-to-moderate epidermal 
hyperpigmentation. These findings were still present with reduced incidence by the end of the 12-week 
recovery phase, indicating a trend towards reversibility. 
Due to the low incidence and severity of injection site findings in studies with SG3199, these findings 
were considered procedural, although a relationship to treatment with SG3199 could not be excluded.

Tissue cross-reactivity study was conducted with ADCT-402 using normal human tissues and blood 
smears. The panel of 37 frozen human tissues used as the test system was considered consistent with 
the tissues recommended in Annex II of Directive 75/318/EEC. Specific, membranous to cytoplasmic, 
staining was observed in mononuclear and/or stellate cells within the majority of human tissue 
specimens. In tissues of the lymphoreticular system (lymph node, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, spleen, thymus and tonsil), positive cells were organised into 
distinct regions, for example coalescing foci within the germinal follicles of the tonsil and extensive 
aggregates throughout the medullary regions of the thymus. This was considered to reflect the 
immunoregulatory function of these organs/tissues and the prominent role of CD19-expressing cells in 
these processes. 
In neuronal tissue, including components of the central (cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord) and 
peripheral (peripheral nerve, optic nerve and retina) nervous systems, positive mononuclear and/or 
stellate cells were located in all regions, including the white/grey matter of the central nervous tissues 
and the endoneurium of the peripheral nervous tissues. This was considered indicative of the presence 
of immunomodulatory CD19-positive cells amongst the neuroglial and/or resident inflammatory cell 
population. Within lymphoreticular, neuronal and the majority of other tissues, there were scattered 
and individualised positive mononuclear and/or stellate cells located throughout the parenchyma. 
These were of variable staining intensity and considered to reflect the relative abundance of static and 
circulatory CD19-positive cells, including B-lymphocytes and cells of follicular dendritic lineage, within 
normal tissue. 
A package of phototoxicity studies was performed to determine the effects of SG3199 on supercoiled 
pUC19 plasmid DNA when analysed on 1% agarose gels with or without exposure to visible light, UVA 
or UVB radiation. The potential effects of visible light on the ability of SG3199 to mediate DNA 
crosslinking and double-strand breaks was evaluated. Similar to UV light, exposure to visible light 
markedly enhanced the ability of SG3199 to induce DNA crosslinking and double-strand breaks. 
Furthermore, similar to UVB, pre-exposure did not affect the intrinsic ability of SG3199 to mediate DNA 
crosslinking and double-strand breaks, and similar enhancement was seen upon re-exposure. SG3199 
is photoreactive, and the exposure to visible light, UVA or UVB radiation enhance its ability to mediate 
DNA crosslinking and double-strand breaks. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The PECsw for loncastuximab tesirine is around 100-fold below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L. The 
PECsw for SG3199, which presents approximately 1% of the total ADC, is even further below the 
trigger value. Hence, further investigations on the environmental fate and effects detailed in Phase II 
Tier A of the EMEA guidance document are not considered required. Experimental log P values of 0.94 
and 1.00 for acidic and neutral conditions were obtained for SG3199 and whilst they are indicative of 
its lipophilic nature, they are far below the trigger value for PBT assessment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Loncastuximab tesirine binds to cell surface CD19 and is internalised. Once inside the cell, the 
cytotoxic drug (SG3199) is released, forming DNA crosslinks and leading to cell death.  The submitted 
pharmacology studies suggest CD19 binding and expression is an important determinant for the 
cytotoxic activity of loncastuximab tesirine. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) component of

loncastuximab tesirine, RB4v1.2, is selective for human CD19 and not cross
reactive with CD19 from 
any nonclinical species. 
‐
The primary pharmacology studies included in vitro cell binding studies, in vitro cytotoxicity studies 
using CD19-positive human cell lines and in vivo tumour growth inhibition studies using several CD19-
positive xenograft murine models The applicant has presented a number of aspects regarding the 
biology of CD19 and mode-of-action of ADCT-402, the preclinical models used, and the translation of 
the nonclinical data to the clinical setting to provide sufficient evidence of the validity of the preclinical 
evaluation of ADCT-402. The nonclinical studies conducted with ADCT-402 using a panel of cell lines 
derived from lymphoma and leukaemia patients have supported the clinical testing of loncastuximab 
tesirine in patients. Findings from these nonclinical studies support the use of cancer cell lines for 
nonclinical studies with ADCs. PBD-based ADCs have shown potent and specific activity, in vitro and in 
vivo, in cancer cell lines and in primary patient samples, including primary paediatric samples. In both 
cell lines and patient-derived material, PBD-based ADCs have shown activity across the entire 
cytogenetic risk spectrum, different molecular abnormalities and independently from Multiple Drug 
Resistance (MDR) positivity status.  
Cell-binding studies showed that the relative binding of RB4v1.2 and ADCT-402 to CD19 was similar, 
indicating that the binding affinity of the RB4v1.2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was unaffected upon 
conjugation of the SG3249 payload.  
The in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCT-402 was assessed in CD19-positive human cell lines (Daudi, DOHH-2, 
GRANTA-519, MEC-2, NALM-6, NAMALWA, Ramos, and SU-DHL-4). 
In study No. SIR041 it was observed that at the highest concentration of ADCT
402 tested (67 nM), 
some cell lines appeared to retain resistant populations of cells, as evidenced by less than 90% total 
cell killing in these cell lines. The phenomenon of the presence of some residual surviving Granta 519 
‐
and Mec2 cells after exposure to ADCT-402 is probably related to the different growth pattern of these 
two cell lines. In view of the above explanations, the issue is not further pursued. 
The in vivo pharmacological activity was characterised in immunodeficient mice using two human 
Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) models (Ramos and Daudi), a human DLBCL model (WSU-DLCL-2), a 
disseminated Ramos model and a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia-derived model (NALM-6).  
Moreover, ADCT-402 was tested in combination with rituximab, a CD20-specific mAb or with the anti-
metabolite chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine in the WSU-DLCL2 xenograft model and with the pan-
class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib in the TMD8 xenograft model. 
ADCT-402 was shown to moderately target CD19-negative cells in co-culture experiments with CD19-
positive and CD19-negative cells and to mediate bystander killing of CD19-negative cells via 
conditioned-medium transfer from ADCT-402-treated, CD19-positive cells. The bystander effect may 
be a contributor to the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine, including the durable responses which 
continue beyond the end of treatment in patients who achieve a response. 
Analytical methods were developed to determine ADCT-402, total RB4v1.2 antibody or SG3199 in rat 
and cynomolgus monkey serum or for determination of SG3199 in in vitro metabolism studies. 
Validated methods were used in the GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat and 
cynomolgus monkey. In addition, in order to determine the formation of ADA in cynomolgus monkey 
serum, a validated method was developed. The validations of the analytical methods included: 
determination of assay range, inter-assay and intra-assay precision and accuracy, selectivity, 
specificity, bench top stability, long-term stability, freeze-thaw stability, hook (prozone) effect. The 
incurred sample reproducibility evaluation could not be found in any study. ISR analyse performed in 
support of the GLP-compliant 4- and 13-week studies with ADCT-402 in cynomolgus monkeys (Study

8303115 and Study 8374716) and the GLP-compliant 4-week study with SG3199 in rats (Study 
527042) met predefined reproducibility criteria for all assays in all studies. 
Absorption studies were not conducted with ADCT-402 or SG3199. All in vivo studies with ADCT-402 or 
SG3199 used the IV route of administration, the intended clinical route of administration for ADCT-
402. 
No distribution studies were conducted with ADCT-402. Given its molecular size, ADCT -402 would be 
expected to be largely confined to the plasma space, similar to the endogenous antibodies and 
monoclonal antibodies. This was confirmed by the TK analyses from 4- and 13 – week repeat dose 
toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, which indicated that the volume of distribution (Vz) was 
generally similar to the plasma volume. 
No metabolism studies were performed on ADCT-402. Monoclonal antibodies are expected to be 
metabolised in the same manner as endogenous antibodies. This is acceptable according to ICHS6(R1). 
In vitro studies indicated that SG3199 is not a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. 
CYP induction studies showed that SG3199 did not induce CYP2B6- or CYP3A4-mediated enzyme 
activity or mRNA expression in human hepatocytes in vitro, whilst a >2-fold increase in CYP1A2 mRNA 
expression (without corresponding increase in enzyme activity) was observed. These data indicate that 
SG3199 is unlikely to induce CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 in vivo and therefore the potential for producing 
clinically relevant CYP induction related drug-drug interactions is considered to be low. However, based 
on the in vitro data SG3199 may be an inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. 
Comparable metabolite profiles were observed upon incubation with rat, cynomolgus monkey or 
human hepatocytes and liver microsomes. Biotransformation by human liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes resulted in ether hydrolysis, amide hydrolysis, various oxygenation biotransformations and 
O-demethylation, or a combination thereof. Results from two approaches to reaction phenotyping 
(recombinant human CYP enzymes and chemical inhibition) indicated potential involvement of 
CYP3A4/5 in the metabolism of SG3199. In addition, based on the extent of substrate loss in the 
absence of NADPH when SG3199 was incubated with human liver microsomes, non-CYP mediated 
metabolism of SG3199 is indicated. 
No nonclinical excretion studies were conducted with ADCT-402, which is acceptable for the antibody 
part as it will undergo normal protein metabolism. 
Excretion of [3H]-SG3199 was mainly via the faeces, biliary route (97.5±3.0%), with minor urinary 
excretion (3.8±0.3%). Excretion was rapid, with most radioactivity (83.5±5.8%) recovered 24 h post 
dose. 
Loncastuximab tesirine was cleared slowly in animals with the half
life ranging from 8 to 17 days in 
‐
monkeys. Exposures to loncastuximab tesirine generally increased dose proportionally with an increase 
in dose level. There were no major differences in plasma exposure between males and females and no 
evidence of accumulation with repeated dosing. Maximal serum concentrations were generally reached 
within 1.5 hours of dosing. Plasma concentrations were overall comparable between loncastuximab 
tesirine and the monoclonal antibody component, and the level of deconjugated SG3199 was below the 
lower limit of quantitation at most timepoints and dose levels in the 13
week repeat
dose study in 
monkeys.  Plasma stability studies combined with the toxicokinetic data in monkeys suggest the ADC is

stable and, when free, SG3199 is highly protein bound in rat, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma 
(approximately 97%, 93%, and 94%, respectively).  [3H]
SG3199 distribution was rapid and 
widespread with the majority of tissues reaching maximum radioactivity at 2 hours post dose, the first 
sampling time point.  There was no apparent distribution of SG3199 to melanin
containing tissues or

dose range studied (0.075
0.9 mg/kg), indicative of a lack of target
mediated drug disposition (TMDD) 
and consistent with the lack of cross
‐
reactivity of RB4v1.2 to cynomolgus monkey CD19. 
‐
The cynomolgus monkey was subsequently selected by the Sponsor as the species for nonclinical 
‐
safety evaluation of ADCT-402, in light of the general suitability of this species for nonclinical safety 
evaluation of ADCs, and the fact that the potential human PK parameters and the toxicities associated 
with SG3199 are adequately predicted in this species to allow for calculation of safe clinical starting 
doses. Potential on-target toxicity could not be evaluated in this species, however, there is extensive 
nonclinical and clinical experience with selective CD19 and CD20 depletion with ADCs and mAbs that 
alleviates potential on-target toxicity concerns. 
In repeat
dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, loncastuximab tesirine exhibited a safety 
profile consistent with SG3199
mediated effects on the skin (epidermal hyperpigmentation with 
‐
hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis), bone marrow (hypocellularity associated with regenerative anaemia), 
kidney (nephropathy—degeneration and hyperplasia/hypertrophy of distal tubules and collecting ducts, 
‐
mainly in the cortico
medullary junction) and testis (testicular atrophy with reduced spermatogenesis). 
The majority of these findings were considered to be reversible, although (full) reversibility was not 
always demonstrated in the context of completed studies. The nonclinical toxicity of SG3199 was 
‐
predominantly evaluated in the rat, with the toxicity profile characterised by myelosuppression, 
increased liver enzymes/liver toxicity, and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with epithelial 
degeneration. 
The majority of the toxicities observed in the 4
week study were also observed in the 13
week study, 
with progression of some findings to lower doses with longer periods of dosing.  For example, the 
‐
‐
incidence of black spots that correlated microscopically with epidermal hyperpigmentation observed at 
0.6 mg/kg q3w in the 4
week study was comparable to the incidence at the 0.3 mg/kg dose in the 13
week study.  Statistically significant decreases in haematocrit and haemoglobin were observed only at

dilatation) were observed at 0.6 mg/kg in the 4

‐
in the 13
week study.  In one 0.6 mg/kg female, slight fibrosis (pleural/subpleural) of the lungs was

phase.  In the 13
week study, multifocal oedema, acute inflammation, and necrosis were observed in 
the lung, but were not present or were reduced in severity by the end of the 12

Taking into account the incidental nature of alveolar haemorrhage in a single animal ~90 days after 
the last ADCT-402 dose and also the lack of evidence of tissue repair, and the difference in anatomic

SG3199 was clastogenic in both the in vitro micronucleus assay and the chromosome aberration assay

of metabolic activation (S9 mix). In the chromosome aberration assay, statistically significant and 
concentration
dependent increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed and were comprised 
mainly of broken segments (gaps or breaks) of one or both chromatids that are aligned or unaligned; a 
single, usually circular, part of a chromatid lacking a centromere; an exchange(s) between two or more 
chromosomes resulting in the formation of a tri

aberrations.  Some aberrations exceeded the positive control range. A GLP bacterial reverse mutation 
assay (Ames test) was also submitted; however, mutagenicity could not be assessed due to 
cytotoxicity at all concentrations tested.  
Given that SG3199 is a potent genotoxicant, in accordance with ICH S9 and ICH S6(R1), no 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted with loncastuximab tesirine, and, 
based on the mode of action of SG3199, reproductive and developmental toxicity is expected. With 
regard to fertility, the potential for effects of loncastuximab tesirine on male and female fertility was 
assessed in the pivotal repeat
dose toxicity study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys by 
evaluation of the reproductive tract (organ weights and histopathological evaluation) as outlined in ICH 
‐
S6(R1). In males, marked testicular toxicity (testicular atrophy with reduced spermatogenesis) was 
observed. These findings are consistent with the pharmacological activity of ADCT-402 and were not 
reversible after a 12-week treatment-free period corresponding to 2 spermatogenic cycles (42 days in 
Cynomolgus monkeys). Therefore, SPC 4.6 should be amended to state that men being treated with 
this medicine are advised to have sperm samples preserved and stored before treatment (OC). In 
females, no effects were reported on reproductive organs. There was no fresh corpus luteum in one 
high dose female at 0.3 mg/kg in the 13
week monkey study.  The relationship of this finding to 
loncastuximab tesirine is uncertain due to the low incidence in the 13
week monkey study and the lack 
‐
of the finding at higher doses in other studies.  Therefore, at this time, this finding and a potential for 
‐
loncastuximab tesirine to impair female reproductive function is not included in labelling. 
Based on nonclinical genotoxicity findings and the mechanism of action of loncastuximab tesirine, the 
applicant states that there is a risk of embryo-foetal toxicity during pregnancy. There are no data on 
loncastuximab tesirine exposure in pregnant women. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
should use effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta and for 9 months after the last 
dose. Similarly, male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception during treatment with Zynlonta, and for 6 months after the last dose. There is no 
sufficient human experience and a relevant risk from non-clinical studies suggest a suspected risk to 
the developing embryo/fetus. Findings in the pivotal 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study of ADCT-402 
included dose-related black skin discoloration, which correlated microscopically with minimal-to-
moderate epidermal hyperpigmentation. These findings were still present with reduced incidence by 
the end of the 12-week recovery phase, indicating a trend towards reversibility.  
Due to the low incidence and severity of the local tolerance findings, these were considered procedural, 
although a relationship to treatment with SG3199 could not be excluded. 
The PECsw for loncastuximab tesirine is around 100-fold below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L. The 
PECsw for SG3199, which presents approximately 1% of the total ADC, is even further below the 
trigger value. Hence, further investigations on the environmental fate and effects detailed in Phase II 
Tier A of the EMEA guidance document are not considered required. Experimental log P values of 0.94 
and 1.00 for acidic and neutral conditions were obtained for SG3199 and whilst they are indicative of 
its lypophilic nature, they are far below the trigger value for PBT assessment. The applicant used in 
silico evaluation to predict the Log P of SG3199. According to the ERA guideline the octanol /water 
partition coefficient Kow should be determined experimentally with regards to GLP compliance. Taking 
into account the low risk due to the negligible release of SG3199 in the environment, an additional 
determination of log Kow is not warranted, and the costs associated with such a determination do not 
weigh up against the very limited impact the results of such a determination would have on the overall 
risk assessment. Therefore loncastuximab tesirine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Loncastuximab tesirine (LT), is a CD19-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of a 
humanised IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human CD19, conjugated to SG3199, a 
pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxic drug, through a protease-cleavable valine-alanine linker. 
SG3199 attached to the linker is designated SG3249 (also known as tesirine). LT has an average of 
approximately 2.3 SG3199 molecules attached per antibody. LT is intended for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy. The proposed dose regimen for LT is 0.15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for the first 2

Page 44/157 
 
 
 
 
 
cycles, then a dose of 0.075 mg/kg Q3W thereafter, as an IV infusion. The dose regimen was chosen 
to minimise the potential for a drug holiday, to mitigate onset and severity of adverse events, and to 
ensure that efficacious drug levels could be maintained. 
Studies providing data for the clinical pharmacology evaluation consist of the ongoing pivotal Phase 2 
study ADCT-402-201, and in the completed Phase 1 studies ADCT-402-101 and ADCT-402-102. Details 
of the clinical studies can be found in table above. The pivotal Phase 2 study was conducted in patients 
with DLBCL, supportive studies are the Phase 1 study ADCT-402-101 in patients with B-cell lineage 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (B-NHL) and the phase 1 study ADCT-402-102 in patients with B-cell 
lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) in ADCT-402-102. 
Dose rationale: The dose escalation of LT started with a dose of 15 µg/kg Q3W in patients with NHL. 
In absence of DLTs in Cycle 1, as dose escalation proceeded to the 200 µg/kg dose level, the MTD was 
not established during the trial. Cumulative toxicity was substantially increased at the 200 µg/kg dose 
compared to lower dose levels. After induction doses of 150 µg/kg Q3W ×2, a 50% dose reduction to 
75 µg/kg Q3W thereafter was instituted in the Phase 2 study to rapidly achieve steady state exposure 
and to mitigate cumulative toxicities. Based on ORR, the proposal to apply the dose reduction regimen 
for patients with DLBCL appeared justified. PBD-conjugated Ab Cavg and Cmin levels monitored early in 
treatment during Cycles 1 and 2 were significantly associated with OR, and Cavg was prognostic for 
association with OS and PFS. The choice of a Q3W dose regimen was based on animal studies and the 
expectation that this interval would result in efficacious drug levels while reducing adverse events. 
Bioanalysis: Three analytes in serum were measured to characterise the pharmacokinetics of LT: total 
(unconjugated and conjugated) Ab, PBD-conjugated Ab, and free cytotoxic agent SG3199. Anti-drug 
Ab (ADA) against LT in serum was measured from the collected samples.  
The total Ab (conjugated and unconjugated) and PBD-conjugated Ab of LT in serum were measured 
using 2 validated electro-chemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIAs) with lower limits of quantitation 
(LLOQs) of 20 and 5.06 ng/mL, respectively. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay was used to measure SG3199 serum concentration with LLOQ of 25 
pg/mL. Screening, confirmation, and titration of anti-LT ADA were performed using a validated bridging 
ECLIA assay. Pre-treatment samples from 7 of the 363 patients treated in total were confirmed as ADA 
positive (1.9% overall of pre-treatment samples). 
PopPK analyses: The population PK of Loncastuximab tesirine total antibody and conjugated antibody 
was described by a 2-compartment linear model with linear clearance and time-dependent clearance in 
parallel and an additive residual error model. A one-compartment model with linear clearance was 
integrated into the model with a linear deconjugation clearance from the central deconjugated antibody 
compartment to account for the formation of free warhead SG3199.

Using drug accumulation by Cycle 2 as a guide, exposures to LT PBD-conjugated Ab and total Ab after 
the 150 μg/kg Q3W doses were increased compared to Cycle 1 (AI = 1.65 and 2.07, respectively). 
PK parameters observed in the target population in studies ADCT-402-101 and ADCT-402-201 are 
found tables below for PBD-conjugated Ab and free SG3199. For SG3199, the majority of time points 
and patients had data that were largely below the LLOQ. Non-compartmental steady state PK data for 
SG3199 have not been provided, which is acceptable since the majority of the sample data had 
measurements below LLOQ.  
Steady state values of Cmax and AUC for LT were calculated from the final popPK model, these data 
are presented in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

Distribution 
SG3199 is highly protein bound in human plasma (94%). In the SmPC, the Vd of LT is stated to be 
7.14 L. 
Elimination 
The elimination route in humans has not been investigated in detail due to the nature of the product. 
This is acceptable considering the nature of the product. The immunoglobulin part is not expected to 
be eliminated differently than other endogenous immunoglobulins.  
In a rat study, the elimination of SG3199 was mainly via biliary excretion and faeces (97.5±3.0%), 
and an in vitro study using recombinant CYP enzymes indicated that CYP3A4/5 is potentially involved 
in the metabolism of SG3199. In the metabolism studies using liver microsomes and hepatocytes from 
different species, no human-specific or disproportionate SG3199 metabolites were detected, with the 
rat and cynomolgus monkey hepatocyte metabolite profiles most closely matching the human 
hepatocyte metabolite profile. Two out of three SG3199 metabolites identified would likely still be able 
to bind DNA, as this is a generic property of PBDs, but as they are monomers rather than dimers they 
would no longer be able to cross-link DNA and would therefore be expected to be less cytotoxic than 
SG3199. 
Via population PK analysis, the CL of LT is estimated to be 0.2 L/day, which is typical for monoclonal 
Abs.  Data on the variability in CL for the active moiety SG3199 has been provided. The CV% for IIV is 
125.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Multiple ascending doses of 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 200 µg/kg of LT were evaluated in ADCT-
402-101. The PK exposure (Cmax and AUC) of PBD-conjugated Ab and total Ab appeared to increase 
with dose. The dose proportionality analyses were performed using a power model based on linear 
regression with log-transformed values. Dose proportionality in the dose range of 15 to 200 µg/kg has 
been shown for AUC (both in cycle 1 and 2) and for Cmax in cycle 2. For Cmax in cycle 1, dose 
linearity was only shown in the dose range of 120 to 200 µg/kg, which could be attributed to the small 
number of patients in the lower dose cohorts.

Figure 10. 
Time dependency: In the popPK analysis, the half-life of LT was 14.6 days at Cycle 1 and 20.6 days 
at steady state. This increase in half-life could be attributed to a decrease in tumour burden and 
therefore in target-mediated disposition.   
Interindividual variability: Based on the population PK analysis, after adjusting for significant 
covariates, the inter-individual variability for CL and V1 of PBD-conjugated Ab was 45.4% and 33.8%, 
respectively. 
Special populations 
Population PK analyses were conducted by pooling data from studies ADCT-402-101 and ADCT-402-
201 to characterise the PK disposition for a typical patient and to identify intrinsic and extrinsic sources 
of exposure variability. The impact of age, race, sex, baseline body weight, baseline lab 
measurements, baseline disease characteristics, ADA, formulation, and selected concomitant agents on 
the PK of LT was evaluated in the population PK analysis. The effects of the selected covariates on LT 
PK are shown as forest plots below.

Impaired renal function: The impact of renal impairment was evaluated in the population PK 
analysis that included patients with normal renal function, and with mild renal impairment or 
moderate/severe renal impairment. The analyses of the impact of mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment comprised 118 patients, 51 patients, and one patient, respectively. Hence, no conclusion 
can be drawn for patients with severe renal impairment. The pattern of decreased exposure to LT with 
renal impairment could be explained by kidney-related factors associated with the underlying disease

e.g. increased glomerular permeability or an increased catabolic state with increased IgG and albumin 
degradation in the renal impairment groups. 
Table 7 
The substantial variability in CL reported in Table 5 above is attributed to variability in time-dependent 
clearance and in deconjugation clearance, which is apparent from Figure below. The applicant argues 
that the skewness may, in part, be due to insufficiency of observations for fully characterising the non-
linear aspects of clearance in some patients.

For SG3199, the available measurable serum concentrations were compared across dose cohorts 
between normal renal function and renal impairment subgroups. There was no sign of association 
between the baseline renal function and SG3199 PK exposure (Figure 12).

Impaired hepatic function: According to the NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group classification, 
patients treated with LT were grouped into different baseline hepatic function subgroups as shown 
Table below. The majority of patients included in the population PK analysis had normal hepatic 
function (n = 278) or mild hepatic impairment (n = 49); 1 patient had moderate hepatic impairment. 
The moderate hepatic impairment and mild hepatic impairment subgroups were merged into 1 
category. An unexpected pattern of decreased exposure to LT (42% lower Cavg, Figure below) has 
been presented, which, according to the applicant, potentially could be clinically relevant.

According to the applicant, the mean clearance reported in Table above (2.21 L/day) represents the 
total mean clearance as defined as the sum of linear clearance + deconjugation clearance + time-
dependent clearance at time 0, which decreases over time due to a decrease in the time-dependent 
clearance. 
Figure 15. 
Gender: Based on popPK analyses, gender did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to 
LT. Females had slightly lower exposure than males, probably reflecting an averagely lower dose 
received.  
Race: Based on popPK analyses, race did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to LT. 
Weight: Based on popPK analyses, body weight did not have a clinically relevant effect on the 
exposure to LT. The evaluated weight range was 42-160 kg. The reference weight range was 65-85 kg. 
Assessment report

Higher weight resulted in slightly higher exposure, and lower weight in slightly lower exposure, 
reflecting the weight-based dose regimen.  
Age: Based on popPK analyses, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to LT. Age 
<65 years resulted in a 14% decrease in Cmax and a 2% decrease in Cavg.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies  
SG3199 is in vitro a substrate of P-gp. Concomitant medication with P-gp inhibitors was included in a 
post-hoc pop PK covariate analysis. Data are limited but no trend of a change in the exposure to 
SG3199 was observed. Based on the provided data, a clinical study with P-gp inhibitors is not 
warranted. In various in vitro test systems, the transporter inhibition of SG3199 was examined and 
most IC50 values were above 10 µM. The IC50 value for MATE2-K was the lowest with 3.25 µM, which 
is far above the typical clinical plasma exposure. 
No dedicated clinical DDI studies have been performed. Based on the nature of the product (ADC 
molecule), the low plasma concentration of SG3199, and the in vitro investigations, this is acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
See above. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity against LT was evaluated in all clinical studies of ADCT-402-101, ADCT-402-201, and 
ADCT-402-102. Data for studies ADCT-402-101 and ADCT-402-201 are summarised below.  
Out of 7 patients with ADA response occurring at any time, ADA-positivity occurred in 1 patient at the 
post-dose timepoint and 6 patients had pre-existing ADA response (Table below).  
Table 10 
The incidence of ADAs against LT seems to be low, and an impact of ADA positivity on the exposure of 
LT was not apparent in studies 101 and 201. However, based on the low number of ADA positive 
patients (n=7), firm conclusions cannot be made.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
LT is an antibody-drug conjugate. The mechanism of action of LT consists of a multi-step process. After 
intravenous (IV) administration, LT binds to CD19, then undergoes receptor-mediated internalisation 
and subsequent lysosomal degradation, which results in the intracellular release of PBD dimer 
cytotoxin (SG3199). Binding of SG3199 to DNA results in the formation of inter-strand cross-links, 
relatively non-distorting DNA structure, which makes them hidden to DNA`s repair mechanisms and 
subsequently causes cell death. 
Although LT is a CD19 directed antibody and depletion of CD19+ B cells is the primary 
pharmacodynamic effect of LT, CD19 as a biomarker was only sparsely investigated and reported.   
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using overall response rate (ORR), 
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the duration of response (DOR) as efficacy 
parameters. For assessment of an exposure-safety relationship, skin and nail reactions, oedema-
effusion, fatigue, pain, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased, group liver function test (LFT) 
abnormalities, neutrophil decreased, and platelet decrease-related toxicities were used as safety 
parameters. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In study 101, change in CD19+ cells were monitored and loncastuximab tesirine has been shown to 
decrease median CD19+ cells by 100% after infusion at the intended starting dose of 150 µg/kg. Data 
are less clear at 60 and 90 µg/kg (Figures below).

According to data issued from study 101, level of CD19 at baseline does not seem to correlate with 
clinical response. Figure below describes response according to CD19 tumour expression suggests 
that there is no difference in categories (CR+PR) and (SD+PD) in function of percentage of CD19+ 
cells in the tumour. Moreover, the applicant analysed CD-19 expression according to 3 classes of 
increasing intensity (+1, +2 and +3 intensity) in responders (CR+PR) and non-responders (SD+PD). 
At the intended posology, frequency of the +3 intensity was similar in responders and non-responders.  
Figure 18. 
LT impact on QTc 
In a concentration-QTcF analysis on data from patients with DLBCL, no evidence of QTc prolongation at 
the recommended LT dose was found. The effect on ΔQTcF for the 150 μg/kg dose was predicted to be 
< 5 ms in both cycle 1 and 2.   
Exposure-efficacy relationships 
Overall response rate (ORR) 
The primary efficacy endpoint used to support the MAA application was ORR in studies ADCT-402-101 
and ADCT-402-201. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response (BOR) 
of CR or PR. The correlation between population PK-predicted PBD-conjugated Ab exposure and the 
ORR was evaluated in patients with DLBCL from both studies. Univariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to evaluate the probability of OR in association with the exposure to PBD-conjugated 
Ab. A significant relationship between Cycle 1 Cavg and the OR was identified (p <0.001) (Figure 
below).

Figure 19. 
In a multivariate logistic regression analysis (full model), the baseline covariates of sex, age, race, 
weight, body surface area, body mass index (BMI), baseline renal/hepatic functions, immunogenicity 
parameters, baseline disease characteristics, elapsed time of initial diagnosis, ECOG performance 
status, selected high risk disease phenotype, bulky disease, prior chemotherapy response, prior stem 
cell therapy, DLBCL diagnosis at baseline, dexamethasone concomitant medication, and study were 
included.  
A stepwise reduction was performed from the full logistic regression model until the Akaike information 
criterion no longer decreased. Backward elimination was further used to retain the significant 
covariates based on α = 0.05 and 95% CI of odds ratios that included 1. The final model included 
Cycle 1 Cavg, baseline tumour sum of area, and disease phenotype as significant predictors of ORR 
(Table below). The odds of ORR increased by 6.095-fold for a 1 μg/mL increase in Cycle 1 Cavg 
(1.198-fold for a 0.1 μg/mL increase). The odds of ORR decreased by 0.985-fold for 1 cm2 increase in 
baseline tumour sum of area, and 0.48-fold for selected high risk disease phenotype. This ORR analysis 
provides direct evidence for a significant E-R relationship.

Table 11 
The number of responders seemed to increase for higher values of Cavg and Cmin in Cycles 1 and 2, 
exhibiting a positive trend between exposure and overall response rate (ORR) as supported by Table 
below. Overall response rate was 64.5% of patients who had drug exposure in the highest quartile 
(Q4) of Cycle 1 Cavg, in comparison to only 25% response in patients from the lowest quartile (Q1). 
Table 12 
Overall survival (OS) 
OS was a secondary efficacy endpoint in ADCT-402-101 and ADCT-402-201. Population PK-predicted 
PBD-conjugated Ab exposure of LT and OS were used to establish the correlation in DLBCL patients 
from both studies. For exploratory analysis, Kaplan-Meier analyses were generated, stratified by 
quartiles of estimated PBD-conjugated Ab Cavg values of 0.0120 to 0.516 μg/mL, 0.517 to 0.728 
μg/mL, 0.729 to 0.942 μg/mL and 0.943 to 1.68 μg/mL. Increasing exposures of PBD-conjugated Ab 
were associated with longer OS (Figure below), with a significant difference in survival determined 
between the different Cavg quartile subgroups (log rank test p = 0.00057911).

Figure 20. 
Given Kaplan–Meier analysis was a univariate analysis and the difference in survival in these exposure 
quartiles may be confounded by other covariates, Cox proportional hazard (CPH) regression models 
were generated to obtain the hazard ratio of each covariate tested. The effects of covariates were 
evaluated through separate univariate Cox regressions, which evaluated the following significant 
covariates (α = 0.05) for entry into the full model: Cycle 1 Cavg, baseline albumin, baseline AST, 
baseline ALKP, hepatic function (mild/moderate impairment versus normal), baseline LDH, baseline 
tumour sum of area, ECOG performance status, disease phenotype (selected high risk versus other), 
bulky disease, prior chemotherapy response, and clinical study (ADCT-402-101 versus ADCT-402-
201). 
Estimates from the final CPH model for OS are presented in Table below. The hazard of death 
decreased by 4.96% for 0.1 μg/mL increase in Cycle 1 Cavg and 7% for 1 g/L increase in baseline

albumin. The hazard of death increased by 212% with bulky tumour, and 69% with mild/moderate 
hepatic impairment. Patients in the 50th and 75th percentiles of Cycle 1 Cavg (0.726 and 0.942 μg/mL, 
respectively) had a risk of death reduced by approximately 39% and 46% relative to patients with the 
minimum Cycle 1 Cavg (0.0120 μg/mL).

Exposure-safety relationships 
Population PK predicted PBD-conjugated Ab exposure and the safety endpoints were used to establish 
correlations in patients with B-NHL from ADCT-402-101 and with DLBCL from ADCT-402-201. 
Exploratory analysis of SG3199 in correlation with safety endpoints was also performed in all patients 
from both studies. 
The safety endpoints for AEs included skin and nail reactions, oedema-effusion, fatigue, pain, gamma-
glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased, group liver function test (LFT) abnormalities, neutrophil 
decreased, and platelet decrease-related toxicities. Grade ≥2 AEs were investigated for the correlation 
with the exposure to LT. This level of toxicity severity was chosen to provide a reasonable 
representation of event frequencies for characterisation. The univariate logistic regression analysis was 
used to establish the correlation between PK exposure of PBD-conjugated Ab and all the listed Grade 
≥2 AEs. For skin and nail reactions, LFT abnormalities, GGT increased and pain, there were significant 
relationships observed for Cavg and Cmin for Cycles 1, 2, and 3. Based upon the lowest p value of the 
model, GGT increased (Grade ≥2) in relationship with Cycle 1 Cavg was selected for further 
investigation.  
Cycle 1 Cavg was significantly correlated with the Grade ≥2 GGT increased (p <0.001). Given a 
statistically significant effect of exposure was observed, a covariate analysis was conducted using the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the final model, Cycle 1 Cavg, baseline ALT, bulky disease 
(bulky versus non-bulky), race (non-white vs. white) and response to prior chemotherapy (BOR of CR 
or PR versus other) were predictors of the probability of increased GGT (Grade ≥2). The odds ratios 
(95% CI) for each predictor in the final model are presented in Table below. The odds of having

for a 0.1 μg/mL increase).

Exploratory SG3199 analysis  
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) is 0.025 ng/mL for SG3199 metabolite. Approximately 96% of 
SG3199 samples were below the LLOQ. An exploratory comparison of TEAEs (grade 2 or more) 
between patients with measurable SG3199 concentrations in Cycles 1, 2 and 3 and patients without 
detectable SG3199 indicates that a higher concentration of the cytotoxic agent leads to more adverse 
reactions (Figure below).

Impact of immunogenicity on efficacy and safety 
The number of ADA positive patients is very small so definitive conclusions cannot be made. Presence 
of ADAs do not seem to negatively affect the efficacy or safety associated with the treatment with LT. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Loncastuximab tesirine (LT), is a CD19-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of a 
humanised IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human CD19, conjugated to SG3199, a 
pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxic drug, through a protease-cleavable valine-alanine linker. 
SG3199 attached to the linker is designated SG3249 (also known as tesirine). Zynlonta as 
monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy. 
The clinical pharmacology programme assessed the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of LT in two clinical 
phase 1 studies and in a clinical phase 2 study. In addition, population PK/PD analyses have been 
performed. LT has not been administered to healthy subjects. 
The total Ab (conjugated and unconjugated) and PBD-conjugated Ab of LT in serum were measured 
using 2 validated electro-chemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIAs) with lower limits of quantitation 
(LLOQs) of 20 and 5.06 ng/mL, respectively. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay was used to measure SG3199 serum concentration with LLOQ of 
0.025 ng/mL. Screening, confirmation, and titration of anti-LT ADA were performed using a validated 
bridging ECLIA assay.  
The population PK of LT total antibody and conjugated antibody was described by a 2-compartment 
linear model with linear clearance and time-dependent clearance in parallel. The following covariates 
were identified as statistically significant and included in the final model: body weight, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, albumin and sex on CL; body weight and sex 
on V1; disease subtype (PTST) and albumin on time-dependent clearance (DELT). A one-compartment 
model with linear clearance was integrated into the model with a linear deconjugation clearance from 
the central deconjugated antibody compartment to account for the formation of SG3199.  
The proposed dose regimen for LT is 0.15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for the first 2 cycles, then a 
dose of 0.075 mg/kg Q3W thereafter, as an IV infusion.  
The product is intended for intravenous administration and the bioavailability is therefore 100% and 
Cmax is reached at the end of infusion. The accumulation index for LT between cycle 1 and 2 is 1.65 
and the Vd of LT is 7.14L. 
Based on modelling, steady state of LT is reached after cycle 3. As for SG3199, the majority of 
samples showed concentration data that were below the LLOQ. Non-compartmental steady state PK 
data for SG3199 have not been provided, which is acceptable since the majority of the sample data 
had measurements below LLOQ.  
The elimination route in humans has not been investigated in detail. This is acceptable considering the 
nature of the product. The immunoglobulin part is not expected to be eliminated differently than other 
endogenous immunoglobulins. In a rat study, the elimination of SG3199 was mainly via biliary 
excretion and faeces (97.5±3.0%), and an in vitro study using recombinant CYP enzymes indicated 
that CYP3A4/5 is potentially involved in the metabolism of SG3199. Via population PK analysis, the CL 
of LT is estimated to be 0.2 L/day, which is typical for monoclonal Abs.  
The lack of information on the PK characteristics of free tesirine is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

In the popPK analysis, the half-life of LT was 14.6 days at Cycle 1 and 20.6 days at steady state. This 
increase in half-life could be attributed to a decrease in tumour burden and therefore in target-
mediated disposition. The interindividual variability of PBD-conjugated Ab for CL and central volume of 
distribution (V1) was up to 45% which is considered moderate.  The inter-individual variability for CL 
of SG3199 is 125%. 
Based on popPK analyses, demographic covariates, such as body weight, sex, age, and race did not 
have clinically relevant effects on the exposure to LT. The impact of mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment on LT PK was evaluated in 49 patients and 1 patient, respectively. Hence, no conclusion 
can be drawn for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. An unexpected pattern of decreased 
exposure to LT (42% lower Cavg) has been presented, which, according to the applicant, potentially 
could be clinically relevant. At the same time, the exposure to SG3199 seems to increase with hepatic 
impairment but SG3199 measurements are not robust due to low plasma concentrations. As for renal 
impairment, an extreme variability in CL of LT was observed. Based on the available data, no dose 
adjustment is considered necessary for any of the covariates. The PK of SG3199 could be better 
characterised in patients with renal and hepatic impairment and this is reflected in the SmPC. 
SG3199 is in vitro a substrate of P-gp. Concomitant medication with P-gp inhibitors was included in a 
post-hoc pop PK covariate analysis. Data are limited but no trend of a change in the exposure to 
SG3199 was observed. Based on the provided data, a clinical study with P-gp inhibitors is not 
warranted. In various in vitro test systems, the transporter inhibition of SG3199 was examined and 
most IC50 values were above 10 µM. The IC50 value for MATE2-K was the lowest with 3.25 µM, which 
is far above the typical clinical plasma exposure. No dedicated clinical DDI studies have been 
performed, which is acceptable.  
Immunogenicity against LT was evaluated in all clinical studies. The incidence of ADAs against LT 
seems to be low, and an impact of ADA positivity on the exposure of LT was not apparent in studies 
101 and 201. However, based on the low number of ADA positive patients (n=7), firm conclusions 
cannot be made. 
In a concentration-QTcF analysis on data from patients with DLBCL, no evidence of QTc prolongation at 
the recommended LT dose was found. The effect on ΔQTcF for the 150 μg/kg dose was predicted to be 
< 5 ms in both cycle 1 and 2. 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using overall response rate (ORR), 
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the duration of response (DOR) as efficacy 
parameters. A significant relationship between cycle 1 Cavg of LT and ORR and OS has been 
demonstrated. The odds of ORR increased 20% with a 0.1 μg/mL increase in Cycle 1 Cavg, and the HR 
for death decreased 4.96% when Cycle 1 Cavg increased 0.1 μg/mL.  
As for exposure-safety relationships, a significant correlation was observed between exposure of PBD-
conjugated Ab (Cavg and Cmin for Cycles 1, 2, and 3) and skin and nail reactions, LFT abnormalities, 
GGT increased, and pain. In the final multivariate regression model, the odds of having increased GGT 
(Grade ≥2) increased 14% with a 0.1 μg/mL increase in Cycle 1 Cavg. Approximately 96% of SG3199 
samples were below the LLOQ. An exploratory comparison of TEAEs (grade 2 or more) between 
patients with measurable SG3199 concentrations in Cycles 1, 2 and 3 and patients without detectable 
SG3199 indicates that a higher concentration of the cytotoxic agent leads to more adverse reactions, 
which is to be expected.  
The number of ADA positive patients is very small so definitive conclusions cannot be made. Presence 
of ADAs do not seem to negatively affect the efficacy or safety associated with the treatment with LT.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package for LT consists of data from three clinical studies and pop PK 
analyses. Considering the nature of the product (ADC molecule) and the fact that the plasma 
concentration of the toxic moiety is very low and below LLOQ in most samples, the pharmacology 
package is considered adequate. The proposed dose regimen of LT seems appropriate.  Relevant 
information on clinical pharmacology has been appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Table 15 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The ADCT-402-101 study is a phase 1, first in human, open-label, dose escalation (Part 1) and 
expansion (Part 2) study of loncastuximab tesirine (LT) as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or 
refractory B NHL (including DLBCL). The ADCT-402-101 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of LT 
and characterised the PK profile of LT.    
LT was administered IV at different dose levels of 15 μg/kg to a maximum of up to 200 μg/kg once 
every 3 weeks. Based on the safety, efficacy and the PK data, the doses and schedules selected for 
Part 2 (expansion) were: 120 μg/kg every 3 weeks and 150 μg/kg every 3 weeks. Some patients in 
this group had their dose reduced to 75 μg/kg every 3 weeks after 3 cycles at 150 μg/kg. 
The ADCT-402-101 study evaluated the activity of LT in 137 previously treated patients. The majority 
of patients had subtype DLBCL (76.0%), of these 26.6% with transformed DLBCL and 16.5% with 
double-hit or triple-hit disease, and the majority having Ann Arbor Stage IV. The majority of patients 
were white (90.6%), 57.6% were male with a median age of 63.0 years (range 20 to 86 years). ECOG 
scores included ECOG 0 (23.7%), ECOG 1 (61.9%) and ECOG 2 (12.9%). The median number of prior 
lines of systemic therapy was 3 (range: 1 to 10), and 39.6% had received ≥4 prior lines and 19.4%

had prior SCT. For patients with DLBCL, 94.3% of patients were in 3L+ setting consistent with the 
intended indication.  
Half of the patients withdrew due to progressive disease, followed by adverse events, physician 
decision, other and death. Of 20 patients who withdrew for “other” reasons 14 had DLBCL. Of these 14 
patients, six patients withdrew to undergo a transplant, two due to progression, one due to 
deterioration, one had CR but decided to withdraw due to fatigue, one patient was elected to withdraw 
and it was patient’s decision for the three remaining patients.  
Table 16 
In the DLBCL Efficacy Analysis Set, the median treatment duration (all dose levels combined) was 64 
days (range: 22 to 277 days) and the mean number of treatment cycles administered was 3.1. 
Regarding efficacy, results from 137 previous-treated patients, showed an ORR of 42.3% (95%CI: 33.9, 
51.2) (all doses) and CR of 23.4%, this is considered clinical meaningful and encouraging in a heavily 
pre-treated population as well as a median DOR of 4.47 months. 
Overall the efficacy data from the ADCT-402-101 study was considered supportive for the initiation of 
the pivotal trial. In conclusion, the recommended dose is 150 μg/kg every 3 weeks for two doses 
followed by 75 μg/kg every 3 weeks for subsequent doses. The dose reduction after 2 cycles was 
based on the fact that a substantial portion of patients treated on the Phase 1 trial required dose 
reduction after 2 or more cycles, usually as a result of prolonged dose delays because of adverse 
events (AEs). Decreasing the dose after 2 cycles was intended to reduce the incidence of dose delay 
and decrease the need for further dose reduction.  The choice of a Q3W dose regimen was based on 
animal studies and the expectation that this interval would result in efficacious drug levels while 
reducing adverse events. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
ADCT-402-201 is an ongoing Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy and

•  Treatments 
Loncastuximab tesirine (LT) was administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 
cycle (Q3W) at a dose of 150 μg/kg for 2 cycles and then 75 μg/kg for subsequent cycles. The study 
included a screening period (of up to 28 days), a treatment period (cycles of 3 weeks) for up to 1 year 
or until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever 
occurred first and a follow-up period. Disease assessments were performed at baseline and 6 and 12 
weeks after Cycle 1, Day 1, then every 9 weeks during the treatment period and at end of treatment 
(EOT).  
Dexamethasone (4 mg orally) as premedication was administered twice daily the day before LT 
administration (if possible), the day of LT administration (given at least 2 hours prior to administration 
when not given the day before; otherwise, any time prior to administration), and the day after LT 
administration.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Please refer to the section above 
•  Sample size 
The sample size of 140 patients was defined based on the assumption that a response rate of 20% 
would be a clinically meaningful option for this patient population. Patients with DLBCL who have failed 
second line therapy have a very poor prognosis, with response to second-line salvage therapy ranging 
from 14-26%, with a median survival of 6.1 months (Seshadri et al., 2008; Crump et al., 2017). 
The primary hypothesis is that the ORR based on central review for patients treated with 
loncastuximab tesirine is significantly greater than 20% (i.e., H0: p ≤ 0.2 vs. Ha: p >0.2). This 
hypothesis will be tested at type I error of 0.05 (two sided). 
The publications referred to by the applicant to justify the objective rate of 20% dated 2008 (Seshadri 
et al.) and 2017 (Crump et al.) are both retrospective studies. It was a retrospective study in patients 
with DLBCL refractory to one treatment line. The publication states that the objective response rate 
was 26% (complete response rate, 7%) to the next line of therapy, and the median overall survival 
was 6.3 months. 
It is to be noted that Yescarta and Kymriah were both authorised in 2018 and tafasitamab was 
authorised in 2021. The ORR for Yescarta (68% at 24-months analysis) and Kymriah (53%) appear to 
be far above the plan target of 20%. However, the objective of 20% was used only for the sample size 
calculation, and the applicant does not propose to include the “p” value in the SmPC. 
Using nQuery exact test for single proportion, a sample size of 140 patients has >99% power to 
achieve a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 (2-sided significance level of 0.05). This sample size will 
provide adequate precision for observed ORR in the expected range. 
Of note, the sample size calculation description was different in the protocol version 1, where a 
Simon’s 2-stage design was implemented with 2 different cohorts (without / with bulky disease). The 
total number of patients was also 140. In the overall summary and rationale for changes from Protocol 
v 1 (protocol amendment 1, page 127 / 411), the applicant claimed that the changed in the study 
design were performed according to suggestions from the FDA.  
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable since it is a single arm study. 
•  Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis populations 
All-Treated Population: All patients who received at least one dose of loncastuximab tesirine. This 
population was used in the primary analyses of efficacy and safety. This is not endorsed since the 
intention to treat principle requires to include all enrolled patients. However, since all enrolled patients 
were treated, sensitivity analyses are not required.  
Per-Protocol Population: All patients in the All-Treated Population who met the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, did not take a prohibited concomitant treatment, and did not have other protocol deviation 
that could have had a major impact on efficacy results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 79/157 
 
 
 
 
 
SCT Population: All patients who responded to loncastuximab tesirine and underwent SCT (either 
autologous or allogeneic) after permanent discontinuation of loncastuximab tesirine treatment without 
any intervening anticancer therapy. (This population was introduced in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
[SAP] and was not specified in the protocol).  
Primary endpoint ORR 
The ORR and the corresponding 95% two-sided exact CI were presented. The overall response 
category was derived based on response assessment performed on or before the start of subsequent 
anticancer therapy/procedure. Patients without documented subsequent anticancer therapy and/or 
with missing start date of anticancer therapy were considered as not having received subsequent 
anticancer therapy. 
A BOR of SD could only be made after the patient was on study for a minimum of 35 days after the 
first dose of loncastuximab tesirine. Any tumor assessment indicating SD before this time period was 
considered as NE for BOR if no assessment after this time period was available. 
Sensitivity analyses 
ORR determined by the independent reviewer’s evaluation for the Per-Protocol Population. ORR 
determined by investigators. 
Secondary endpoints 
Duration of response will be estimated and displayed for the all-treated population using Kaplan-Meier 
methods. 
Censoring rules 
Patients who have the event after the start of subsequent anticancer therapy/procedure, or are 
progression-free and alive at the time of clinical cut-off, or have unknown status, will be censored at 
the last valid tumour assessment on or before the start of subsequent anticancer therapy/procedure or 
clinical cut-off time. 
When a subsequent anticancer therapy is used and progressive disease (based on radiographic or 
clinical progression at EOT/EOS) is observed within 6 days, they will be considered as the same visit 
(within the protocol specified +/-6 days visit window) and the patient will be counted as having an 
event (losing the response). Patients with no post-baseline disease assessment will be censored on 
Day 1. 
Sensitivity analyses 
A sensitivity analysis of DOR will be conducted in which the DOR for patients undergo SCT will not be 
censored at SCT. A sensitivity analysis of DOR per investigator assessments will also be conducted.  
Clinical progression at EOT/EOS without radiographic assessment could be considered as an event in a 
sensitivity analysis.  
Complete response rate (CRR), RFS, PFS and OS 
CRR will be analysed as described for ORR. The same methods described for DOR were implemented 
for the analysis of RFS and PFS. OS was estimated and displayed for the All-Treated Population using 
Kaplan-Meier methods. For OS, patients who were known to be alive as of their last known status were 
censored at their date of last contact, and Patients who were lost to follow-up were censored at the 
date the patient was last known to have been alive.

Interim Analyses and multiplicity control 
An interim analysis for futility was performed when the first 52 patients dosed had two tumor 
assessments (approximately 12 weeks after start of loncastuximab tesirine). The ORR and the 
corresponding 95% CI were reported. Enrollment continued during the interim analysis. If <10 patients 
responded the study enrollment was to be halted. Other analyses such as DOR, PFS, CR rate, RFS, OS, 
and safety analyses may have been performed if necessary. A futility interim analysis is not expected 
to inflate the type I error. The applicant presented the response results: 23 patients had complete or 
partial response and therefore the study was not halted due to futility. 
One primary endpoint was defined (ORR) as the first testing endpoint. A strategy to control for multiple 
secondary endpoints was not found. Therefore, the p-values corresponding to the secondary endpoints 
cannot be interpreted. 
Changes to the Planned Statistical Analyses 
1. There were two patient populations added to the SAP that were not previously described in the 
protocol: 
• SCT Population 
• PRO Analysis Population 
2. A PK Population was defined in the protocol as being performed in the Per-Protocol Population. This 
was changed to the All-Treated Population.  
3. An additional efficacy analysis; time to tumour response, was conducted although it was not 
previously described in the protocol: 
• Time to tumour response was evaluated for the subset of patients who achieved a CR or PR as BOR 
before the start of subsequent anticancer therapy or procedure from the time of first dose to the initial 
documented response. For this subset of patients, time to tumour response was summarised using 
descriptive statistics. 
The current version of the SAP is version 2.0 dated 2 Mar 2020.  
The applicant defined additional populations in the SAP and incorporated a secondary endpoint “Time 
to tumor response”.  
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Overall, 145 patients were treated and included in the All-Treated Population of pivotal study ADCT-
402-201. Although data for the supportive phase 1 ADCT-402-101 trials are also presented in the 
tables, comments are related to the pivotal study.

Study initiation date was 01 Aug 2018, the initial data cut-off date (DCO) was 06 Apr 2020, but 
updated data were submitted during the procedure with cut-off date 01 Mar 2021. Unless otherwise 
specified, the data presented in this report correspond to the latest data cut-off. 
The study has completed enrolment and 145 patients were enrolled at 16 centres in the US, 6 centres 
in the United Kingdom (UK), 5 centres in Italy and 1 centre in Switzerland.

The main reason for exclusion during screening was lack of adequate organ function (16/37) followed 
by ECOG score above 2 (5/37), lack of measurable disease (4/37), and bulky disease ≥10 cm (3/37). 
According to the patient disposition table above, the primary reasons for treatment withdrawal were 
PD (n=82, 56.6%) and unacceptable toxicity (n= 32, 22.1%). Although the toxicity rate may be 
considered relatively high, the PD rate is as expected in a R/R DLBCL setting. 108 patients (74.5%) 
discontinued from the study, the most common reason was death (n=96, 66.2%). The number of 
patients lost to follow-up is low (4 subjects). Seven patients are listed as withdrawal by subject and 
two due to other reasons. The applicant has also provided narratives for the patients withdrawing due 
to “Other reasons” or “Withdrawal by subject”. As expected, elderly patients with adverse events 
severely affecting quality of life regularly choose to withdraw although the study rules did not request 
them to discontinue. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 09 Mar 2018 and was amended before implementation in response to 
US FDA recommendations.  
Amendment 1, 05 Apr 2018:  
• The study design was changed to a single cohort with the primary endpoint being ORR in all-
treated patients, resulting in changes to primary and secondary objectives and endpoints, and 
statistical considerations. 
• For eligibility, pathologic diagnosis was clarified to align with the 2016 WHO classification, the 
requirement for patients to be ineligible or have failed SCT was removed (as the FDA felt that 
loncastuximab tesirine was potentially suitable for third line therapy in patients who were 
potentially eligible for SCT), and the specific requirement for rituximab therapy was deleted as 
it was expected that all patients would have received this in at least one prior line of therapy. 
• For patients whose disease was not PET-avid, bone marrow biopsy was added as part of 
baseline staging and disease assessment if clinically appropriate to fully align with the 2014 
Lugano Classification. 
• Safety follow-up was extended to 180 days after transplant for patients who had responded 
to loncastuximab tesirine and gone on to SCT to monitor for possible increased transplant-
related toxicity in patients who had been treated with loncastuximab tesirine. 
• The exposure relationship to blood biomarkers was removed because there was no plan to 
perform this against the pharmacogenetic measures. 
Amendment 1.1 UK 28 Jun 2018 and Amendment 1.1 SZ 20 Jul 2018 allowed patients who were 
clinically benefiting of the study to continue treatment beyond one year.  
Amendment 2, 24 Sep 2018: The purposes of the amendment were the following: 
• Patients with bulky disease (defined as at least one lymph node ≥10 cm in longest diameter) 
were excluded based on analysis of Phase 1 data showing that these patients had an ORR of 
11%. Based on an interim analysis this was the ORR at the time of this analysis. 
• The inclusion criterion regarding hepatic function was revised to no longer allow patients with 
ALT, AST, and GGT ≤5×ULN if there was liver involvement, to be consistent with the 
requirement to hold the dose of loncastuximab tesirine for patients with Grade ≥2 liver function 
test abnormalities.  
• A definition of overdose and instructions for reporting overdoses were added. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 83/157 
 
 
 
• Patients who were clinically benefiting were allowed to continue treatment beyond 1 year 
with Sponsor review and approval. 
• A requirement for dose discontinuation for dose delays >5 weeks due to toxicity at least 
possibly related to loncastuximab tesirine was added. 
• The requirement for IV contrast for PET-CT was removed and the type and timing of efficacy 
assessments were removed. 
Amendment 3, 07 Jun 2019: was approved internally by ADC Therapeutics. This amendment was not 
submitted to any study sites, regulatory agencies, or ethics committees. All changes from amendment 
2 are included in amendment 4 (below). The modifications aimed to improve the safety of participants 
or to allow for capture of response information and adverse events for patients who received 
subsequent CAR-T therapy.  
Amendment 4, 09 Jul 2019:  
• The text was updated to include information regarding monitoring for extravasation during or 
after loncastuximab tesirine infusion because of updated safety information. 
• The instructions for dose delays and modifications for nonhematologic and hematologic 
toxicities were clarified and updated. 
• Efficacy assessments were updated to allow for capture of response information during the 
follow-up period for patients who received CAR-T therapy after loncastuximab tesirine 
treatment. 
• AE/SAE reporting requirements for patients who received CAR-T therapy after loncastuximab 
tesirine discontinuation were added. 
• Editorial corrections and clarifications were applied throughout. 
Protocol deviations  
Important  deviations  were  identified,  these  deviations  excluded  patients  from  the  Per-Protocol 
Population. Overall, there were 11 patients with an important CSR-reportable protocol deviation. 
Eight patients had inclusion or exclusion criteria deviations:  
• 
• 
Three patients had elevated GGT levels (inclusion criterion #8c), 1 patient did not have results 
available for AST at screening so results were not confirmed before dosing (inclusion criterion 
#8c) 
Three patients tested positive for hepatitis virus and were receiving antiviral therapy (protocol 
amendment #2, exclusion criterion #11) 
•  One patient was enrolled with bulky disease (Protocol Amendment #2, exclusion criterion #4) 
•  One patient received a prohibited concomitant therapy (radiation therapy for lytic lesion on C5 
vertebrae). 
• 
Two patients had study drug deviations: 
o  One patient with a BMI >35 was administered loncastuximab tesirine based on actual 
weight  instead  of  ABW  for  the  first  infusion  that  was  19.6%  higher  than  per-protocol 
planned dose according to ABW. 
o  One  patient  was  administered  study  drug  that  was  18%  lower  than  the  planned  dose 
according to ABW for all 3 cycles.

Figure 22 
ORR as assessed by independent review, the primary endpoint of study of study ADCT-402-201 was 
48.3% (70/145 patients; 95% CI: 39.9, 56.7) and endorsed by the supportive study ADCT-402-101. 
ORR by Investigator assessment was 49.7% (72/145 patients; 95% CI: 41.3, 58.1).  
Complete response rate was observed for 24.8% (36/145 patients, 95% CI:18.0, 32.7). The CR rate is 
considered clinically relevant as a potential surrogate endpoint of PFS in high-grade R/R DLBCL. 
Updated ORR data for the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 with a data cut-off date of 01 March 2021 
showed an ORR of 48.3% (70/145 patients, 95% CI: 39.9, 56.7– see Table 24 above). The applicant 
has compared LT to approved and recommended therapies in r/r DLBCL utilizing an MAIC with 
historical data.

The median duration of response (DOR) for the 70 responding subjects was 13.37 months (95% CI: 
6.87, NE). Median DoR was not reached for CR patients, and was 5.68 months (95% CI: 1.64, 9.26) 
for PR patients. 
The median DOR for patients with SCT not censored was also 13.37 months (95% CI: 6.87, NE).

There were two different formulations administered during LT clinical development (lyophilised and 
liquid formulation). The applicant provided efficacy results according to the formulation administered. 
Overall, although the small number of patients who received the liquid formulation do not allow a firm 
conclusion, it is agreed that especially for ORR, no major difference was observed. 
The protocol of the pivotal phase II study ADCT-402-201 recommends a dose delay in case of toxicities 
followed by dose reduction if the toxicity require more than a 3-week delay. In addition, the dose may 
also be reduced upon investigator's decision for any grade ≥3 toxicity (≥2 for oedema, effusion, or 
increased AST/ALT/GGT) possibly related to LT even if it does not result in dosing delay of more than 3 
weeks. However, no efficacy analysis is provided in such case. 
With regards to the recommendations of the SmPC (suspension with further dose reduction by 50% if 
dosing is delayed by more than 3 weeks), the applicant was required to provide an efficacy analysis for 
patients who had a dose reduction subsequently to dose delay at 50% of the initial dose, and for 
patients with a dose delay which did not require dose reduction. 
Secondary endpoint – Progression-free Survival 
The  median  PFS  in  the  All-Treated  Population  was  4.93  months  (95%  CI:  2.89,  8.31)  with  SCT  not 
censored. With clinical progression imputed as an event, median PFS was 4.40 months (95% CI: 2.76, 
8.08).

The median time to response (CR or PR) in the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 was 41.0 days (range: 35 
-247 days), similarly 43.0 days (range 31-323) for the supportive study ADCT-402-101, indicating that 
most responders had a response after 2 doses of the study drug.    
The median duration of response (DOR) for the 70 responding subjects was 13.37 months (95% CI: 
6.87, NE) in the pivotal study, this is considered highly clinical meaningful. But for the supportive 
Study, ADCT-402-101, median DOR was 4.47 months (95% CI: 3.94 to 9.46).  
Similarly, a difference was noted between the PFS results for the pivotal and the supportive study. In 
the Study ADCT-402-201, the median PFS was 4.93 months (95% CI: 2.89, 8.31) compared with 2.83      
months (95% CI: 1.91, 3.75) in the Study ADCT-402-101.   
Median OS for the 145 patients in Study ADCT-402-201 was 9.53 months (95% CI: 6.93, 11.47) and 
7.46 months (95% CI: 5.95 to 9.79 months) in the Study ADCT-402-101.  
Health-related Quality of Life 
The PRO/HRQoL were collected using the EQ-5D-5L and FACT-Lym questionnaires in the PRO population 
which included 130 patients. The patients were classified as improved/deteriorated based on minimally 
clinically important differenced for EQ-5D-5L score and FACT-Lym. 
EQ-5D-5L 
A total of 97.2% of patients completed the baseline EQ-5D-5L assessment. The completion rate among 
patients who were treated at each visit was ≥92% up to Cycle 9. After Cycle 9, <20 patients were treated.  
The mean (std) EQ-5D-5L VAS score was 71.4 (19.1) at baseline. During the course of treatment, 
41.4% of patients showed improvement at one or more visits by at least 7 points, 39.6% showed 
deterioration at one or more visits by at least 7 points, and 65.8% remained stable (change <7 points) 
across visits. When averaging the change from baseline scores for each patient across visits during the 
course of treatment, 27.9% of the patients showed improvements by at least 7 points, 20.7% showed

deterioration, and 51.4% remained stable. The mean VAS change score showed a trend of 
improvement on overall health over time. 
FACT-Lym 
The completion rate for FACT-Lym subscale and composite scores in the PRO-Population was 93.8% at 
baseline, and ≥88% of patients at each visit completed the FACT-Lym subscale and composite scores 
up to Cycle 9. After Cycle 9, there were <20 patients in treatment. 
During the course of the treatment, 42.5% of the patients showed improvement for one or more visits 
by at least 3 points, 43.4% showed deterioration for one or more visits by at least 3 points, and 60.2% 
remained stable (change less than 3 points) in all visits. When averaging the change from baseline 
scores for each patient across visits during the course of the treatment, 26.5% of patients showed 
improvement by at least 3 points, and 27.4% showed deterioration by at least 3 points, and 
approximately half showed no change. Mean changes in all FACT-Lym subscale and composite scores 
were generally stable over time. Mean changes in all FACT-Lym subscale and composite scores were 
generally stable over time.  
FACT-Lym subscales that showed a trend of improvement from baseline over time were emotional 
well-being (except Cycle 15 Day 1) and LymS (except Cycle 15 Day 1). The subscales of PWB and 
functional well-being (except Cycle 15 Day 1) were relatively stable from baseline over time and the 
subscale of social/family well-being showed a trend of deterioration from baseline over time.

The ORR was 49.2% in the <65 years age group (n= 65), 45.8% in the ≥65 to <75 years age group 
(n= 59), and 52.4% in the ≥75 years age group (n=21). The subgroup analysis of ORR by Independent 
Reviewer showed no notable difference in ORR when analysed by sex, country or age, neither whether 
transformed disease or de novo, although small numbers of patients had transformed disease. The 
applicant also performed analysis of ORR in relation to prior treatment, for the 24 patients who had 
received prior SCT, the ORR was 58.3% and ORR was 46.2% for the 13 patients who had received 
prior CAR-T.

A total of 12 patients received stem cell transplantation (SCT) directly following loncastuximab tesirine 
therapy. Eleven patients received SCT as consolidation therapy after responding to loncastuximab 
tesirine These patients underwent SCT without intervening therapy. One patient went directly to 
allogeneic SCT after progression following loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Out of the 12 patients, 5 
died at some time after transplant (2 of disease progression and 3 of other reasons).  
Sixteen patients received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy at some time after 
progression following loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Out of these 16 patients, 10 died at some time 
after CAR-T therapy (9 of disease progression and 1 of other reasons).  
In order to evaluate any potential centre effects, efficacy outcomes were compared for the largest sites 
vs all other sites: Overall, it is noted that efficacy data, in particular ORR, was similar between the 
largest sites versus all other sites. 
Analysis of CD19 and efficacy 
Immunophenotypic analysis of CD19 was not performed for the majority of the patients, (n=105, 
72.4%). Retrospective central tumour CD19 expression data were available for the archival biopsies of 
134 patients. Overall, the preliminary analyses conducted suggested no correlation between tumour 
CD19 expression in archival biopsies and clinical response or safety.  
The 40 patients who had an assessment of CD19 were those for whom a local test was available but 
otherwise 135 patients had a retrospectively CD19 assessment by IHC (CD19 expression was required 
only for patients who previously received a CD-19-directed therapy). Regarding the 8 patients who 
were found to be negative for CD19, 6 showed responses (3 with PR and 3 with CR). However, 6 of 
these patients had a central assessment of CD19 that showed presence of CD19+ tumour cells. 
However, it was not possible to identify if these are the 6 patients with a response notably as the 
identification number for all but one patient  was not found in the listings. It is acknowledged that 
these discrepancies may be due to several factors (difference in sensitivity of tests, tumour 
heterogeneity). Regarding the 135 with an archival biopsy, the expression of CD19 did not correlate 
with response to LT. Of these 135 patients only 59 had a biopsy obtained after the last treatment 
before administration of LT. Based on the results of the analysis provided by the applicant of these 59 
patients whose CD-19 expression most likely represent the CD19 status at the time of LT treatment, 
the percentage of positive CD19 tumour cells and the H-score did not correlate with response to LT. 
Overall, considering the apparent lack of correlation between CD19 level of expression and response to 
LT treatment based on the analysis of the 135 patients, it is acknowledged that a testing for CD19 
expression is not required.

2.6.5.6.  Supportive study 
The ADCT-402-101 study is a first in human, phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation study (Part 1) and 
expansion (Part 2). It is considered a supportive study, please refer to Section 3.2 and the 
pharmacokinetic part. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Pivotal study ADCT-402-201: is a phase 2, open-label, multicentre, single-arm study of the efficacy 
and safety of loncastuximab tesirine (LT) (Zynlonta) as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL. A total of 145 patients were enrolled from the US and EU, the vast majority being 
white. Considering the rarity and prognosis of this clinical setting, the design of the pivotal study is 
endorsed and its open-label nature is acceptable. Although there is no standard of care for R/R DLBCL, 
an RCT would have been preferred with the physicians’ best choice as comparator. However, the 
applicant has commenced a phase 3 study as confirmatory study for a CMA application.   
Patients included had all received 2 or more lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, with R-CHOP 
being the most common one as first line and the majority of the patients had advanced disease, 64.1% 
had stage IV, and 77.2% had Stage III/IV, indicating high grade disease. The majority of patients (n= 
127, 87.6%) had DLBCL NOS (according to the 2016 WHO classification) of which 25 patients (17.2%) 
were transformed from follicular lymphoma.  
The mean age of patients from the pivotal study was 62.7 years, the majority were <65 years of age 
(44.8%) or ≥65 to <75 (40.7%), and 14.5% were 75 years of age or more, this is reassuring, since 
DLBCL typically affects older individuals. The median number of prior systemic therapy was 3.0 (range 
2-7). A total of 29 patients (20.0%) had primary refractory disease, 57.9% were refractory to their 
most recent line of prior systemic therapy and the majority of the patients, 68.3% had relapse after 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 101/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their first line of prior systemic therapy. In conclusion the prognosis was unfavourable, and the 
enrolled patients were aligned to the in- and exclusion criteria. 
The primary endpoint ORR according to the 2014 Lugano classification is considered acceptable and 
clinically meaningful considering the single-arm trial and the clinical setting. Secondary endpoints, such 
as DOR and PFS are also endorsed. The applicant presented sensitivity analyses implementing the 
following censoring rules: Progressive disease (PD)/death after new anticancer therapies other than 
transplant are counted as events and PD/death after stem cell transplant (SCT) are censored at the 
last valid assessment date before the transplant. The results were consistent with those reported in the 
CSR.  
LT is a CD19-targeted antibody, and the CD19 analysis of the tumours is therefore of interest. The 
majority of sites reported that a local test for CD19 was not performed. Retrospective central tumour 
CD19 expression data were available for the archival biopsies of 134 patients. Overall, the preliminary 
analyses conducted suggested no correlation between tumour CD19 expression in archival biopsies and 
clinical response or safety.  
The supportive study ADCT-402-101, was a first-in-human Phase 1 study of LT in patients with 
relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-NHL. The study design involved a dose escalation part (Part 1) followed by 
a dose expansion part (Part 2). A total of 183 patients received at least 1 infusion of LT, at initial doses 
of 15 to 150, or 200 μg/kg. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint, ORR by IRC was 48.3% (70/145 patients; 95% CI: 39.9, 56.7), and CR of 
24.1% (35/145 patients, 95% CI:17.4, 31.9). These results are encouraging and clinical meaningful in 
the R/R DLBCL setting. The ORR in the study ADCT-402-101 is supportive to the pivotal study, showing 
an ORR of 42.3% (95% CI: 33.9, 51.1).   
The median time to response (CR or PR) in the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 was 41.0 days (range: 35 
to 247 days), similarly 43.0 days (range 31-323) for the supportive study ADCT-402-101, indicating 
that most responders had a response after 2 doses of the study drug. The median duration of response 
(DOR) for the responding subjects was 13.37 months (95% CI: 6.87, NE) in the pivotal study, which is 
considered highly clinical meaningful. For the supportive study, ADCT-402-101, the median DOR was 
4.47 months (95% CI: 3.94 to 9.46). Similarly, a difference was noted between the PFS results for the 
pivotal and the supportive study. In study ADCT-402-201, the median PFS was 4.93 months (95% CI: 
2.89, 8.31) compared with 2.83 months (95% CI: 1.91, 3.75) in the Study ADCT-402-101.  Although 
the Study ADCT-402-101 was a dose escalation study, the difference in DOR and PFS between the 
pivotal and the supportive study is not understood, especially since the ORR results are similar and the 
patients in the two studies seem to be comparable in most other aspects. The applicant states that the 
numerically higher DOR, PFS, and OS in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in 
Study ADCT-402-201 relative to patients treated in Study ADCT-402-101 likely reflects the fact that all 
patients treated in Study ADCT-402-201 received the optimal dosing regimen of loncastuximab tesirine 
with the planned reduction after Cycle 2, which provides consistent efficacious exposure. This could be 
correct. No difference was noted for OS, between the two studies, the median OS for the pivotal study 
was 9.53 months (95% CI: 6.93, 11.47) and 7.46 months (95% CI: 5.95 to 9.79 months) for the 
supportive study. This is considered reassuring and of clinical importance.   
Subgroup analyses of ORR were performed and showed no notable difference in ORR when analysed by 
sex, country or age, neither whether transformed disease or de novo. The ORR seem to be negatively 
affected by known unfavourable prognostic factors, such as refractory disease to first line therapy and 
any line of prior systemic therapy, bulky disease and double-hit/triple-hit disease, this is as would be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 102/157 
 
 
 
expected. Although reassuring, the data should be interpreted with caution due to small subgroups and 
the single-arm design. A total of 12 patients received stem cell transplantation (SCT) directly following 
loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Out of the 12 patients, 5 died at some time after transplant (2 of 
disease progression and 3 of other reasons). It is encouraging that LT may also be used as bridging 
towards SCT.  
In study 201 16 patients received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy at some time after 
progression following loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Out of these 16 patients, 10 died at some time 
after CAR-T therapy (9 of disease progression and 1 of other reasons). Although LT may facilitate 
bridging to CAR-T treatment, the efficacy and safety of this treatment after LT needs further 
exploration.  
According to the inclusion criteria, three subtypes of DLBCL from the 2016 WHO classification of 
lymphoid neoplasms (Swerdlow et al, Blood 2016) were to be recruited in this single-arm trial: DLBCL-
NOS, HGBL and PMBCL. Baseline characteristics of the recruited patients reflect this requirement, 
noting the currently adopted 5th edition of the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms (Alaggio et al, 
Leukemia 2022) outlines that DLBCL NOS, HGBL and PMBCL are all lymphoma entities within the LBCL 
group. However, evidence of efficacy of Zynlonta in the PMBCL subtype in the pivotal ADCT-402-201 
(response in 1 out of 7 patients) is insufficient to guarantee its inclusion in the therapeutic indication. 
Furthermore, clarification that Zynlonta is to be given as monotherapy was required. These 
observations have resulted in the modification of the initially proposed indication as follows: 
“Zynlonta as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy”. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine in relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients having received ≥ 2 
prior lines of systemic therapy is considered promising and clinical meaningful in a clinical setting with 
no standard of care therapy and a dismal prognosis.  
In the context of a CMA, the applicant needs to conduct a confirmatory study within a reasonable 
timeframe to corroborate the efficacy and safety of Zynlonta. The applicant has initiated study ADCT-
402-311, which is a phase 3, controlled, randomised study of loncastuximab tesirine combined with 
the CD-20-targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab (Lonca-R) versus standard immunochemotherapy 
(rituximab / gemcitabine / oxaliplatin) in patients with R/R DLBCL. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The applicant has submitted safety data from 5 clinical studies with loncastuximab tesirine with the 
data cutoff date of 01 Mar 2021. The primary studies for safety of monotherapy with loncastuximab 
tesirine in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL are the pivotal Study ADCT-402-201 and the 
first-in-human Study ADCT-402-101, hence, safety data from these studies will be the main focus of 
the assessment of the safety profile of loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy. 
ADCT-402-201 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of 
loncastuximab tesirine in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The study has completed 
enrolment and 145 patients were enrolled at 16 centres in the US, 6 centres in the United Kingdom 
(UK), 5 centres in Italy and 1 centre in Switzerland. At the time of data cutoff for this submission, 
145 patients had received at least 1 dose of loncastuximab tesirine, all patients had treatment 
withdrawn and 108 patients had discontinued from the study. There were 37 patients in follow-up. The

recommended dose of loncastuximab tesirine of 150 µg/kg every 3 weeks for the first two cycles 
followed by 75 µg/kg every 3 weeks for subsequent cycles was used in this study. 
ADCT-402-101 was a completed Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2) 
study of the safety and tolerability of 183 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (B-NHL) conducted at 8 centres in the US, 2 centres in the UK and 1 centre in Italy. The 
dosing in this study ranging from initial doses of 15 to 200 µg/kg was used to establish the 
recommended dosing regimen.

At the DCO of 1 March 2021, among the 215 patients who received 150 µg/kg loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy, the median treatment duration was 45.0 days (range: 1 to 569) and the median number 
of treatment cycles administered was 3.0 cycles (range: 1 to 26). The median total weight-adjusted 
dose administered was 375.51 µg/kg (range: 122.4 to 2,061.1), while the median average 
weight-adjusted dose per cycle was 125.97 µg/kg (range: 49.2 to 160.6). 
The applicant finds that the 215 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with an 
initial loncastuximab tesirine dose of 150 µg/kg are the most relevant to determine the safety profile 
for the submitted indication, with the remainder of the patients in the safety database providing 
supportive information.

Almost all of the patients in the relevant safety pool (n=215) had an AE (98.6%), and the most 
common were: GGT increased (35.8%), neutropenia (34.9%), fatigue (30.2%), anaemia (28.8%), 
thrombocytopenia (28.4%), nausea (26.5%), oedema peripheral (23.3%), cough (20.9%), rash 
(20.0%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (19.1%), diarrhoea (17.7%), pyrexia and 
hypokalaemia (16.7% each), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased and constipation (16.3% each), 
dyspnoea and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (15.8% each), vomiting (15.3%), 
decreased appetite (14.4%), pleural effusion (13.5%), hypomagnesaemia (13.0%), abdominal pain 
and pruritus (11.6% each), and hypophosphataemia (11.2%).

Grade 3 or higher AEs were also very common (74.4%), and those often reported were (grade 3 and 
>grade 3): neutropenia (24.2% and 20.0%), GGT increased (17.2% and 13.5%), thrombocytopenia 
(15.8% and 9.8%), anaemia (11.6% and 6.5%), and neutrophil count decreased (3.3% and 2.8%). 
It is noted that haematological toxicities are common, also of high grade, and this is further assessed 
under Adverse events of special interest (AESI’s).  
Clinical GI toxicities such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, decreased appetite and 
abdominal pain were rather commonly observed and this is concerning, as they may affect the 
patient’s general condition and lead to weight loss and/or other detrimental effects to the prognosis. 
However, of these only a fraction of the AEs of nausea (26.5%) were assessed to be treatment related 
(16.7%), so the remaining AEs could be considered to be due to the underlying disease of DLBCL, 
which is plausible. However, it is noted that symptoms that may be caused by infusion-related 
reactions were reported with LT, such as rash and nausea, although no infusion-related reactions were 
reported in the dossier or the SmPC for LT.

The majority of patients had a treatment-related AE (ADR) i.e. 81.9%, of which 51.2% had a grade 3

(26.0%), fatigue (20.9%), rash (19.5%), oedema peripheral and nausea (16.7% each),

thrombocytopenia (16.3%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (14.9%), anaemia (13.5%), AST 
increased (11.6%) and pleural effusion and ALT increased (11.2% each).  
The most frequently observed grade 3 or higher ADRs were neutropenia (24.2%), GGT increased 
(17.2%), thrombocytopenia (15.8%), anaemia (11.6%) and neutrophil count decreased (3.3%).  
The safety profile is considered partly due to adverse drug effects, especially the increased GGT and 
peripheral oedema and pleural effusions. However, the haematological toxicity can also be related to 
late effects of prior treatments in this heavily pre-treated study population.  
It is noted that neutropenia was very common (34.9%) and grade 3 or higher was observed in 24.2% 
of the patients, while only 3.3% had febrile neutropenia. The applicant has clarified that grade 3 and 
higher neutropenia was managed by holding loncastuximab tesirine therapy until the patient recovered 
to Grade 2 or lower. In the safety data base (n=215 patients), 33.5% of patients received at least 1 
dose of a neutrophil growth factor (prophylactically to 15.3% of patients and as treatment to 26.0% of 
patients). Only 1 (0.5%) patient discontinued LT due to neutropenia.  
Adverse events of special interest 
The 5 AE groups of special interest were oedema or effusion, fatigue, LFT, pain, and skin reactions and 
nail disorders. Three AE groups of particular interest (oedema or effusion, LFT, and skin reactions and 
nail disorders) were identified based on the AE profiles of other PBD-based therapies reported in the 
literature and early clinical data.

Among the 215 patients who received the proposed dosing, 36.3% of the patients had oedema or 
effusions, and 23.3% had peripheral oedema (grade 3: 1.4%), while pleural effusion was observed in 
13.5% (grade 3: 0.4%). Grade 3 or higher events of ascites, pericardial effusion or peripheral oedema, 
in 3 patients each, while 1 patient each had lymphoedema grade 3 or peripheral swelling grade 3. 
Hence, low grade oedema and/or effusions were common with LT, but this was not a dose-limiting 
toxicity.

The applicant has clarified that among the patients who had oedema or effusions, 30 patients (38.5%) 
had cardiac conditions. The table above provides the medical history relating to cardiac disorders for 
patients with oedema or effusion by system organ class and preferred term among the population of 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy at the 150 
μg/kg dose level. The most common supportive measure was diuretic medication, with 50 patients 
(64.1%) receiving this therapy for oedema or effusion. Albumin administration was infrequent, with 
only 3 patients (3.8%) receiving this therapy for oedema or effusion. 
The applicant has clarified that the events of effusions and oedema reported in patients receiving 
loncastuximab tesirine in clinical studies, including peripheral oedema, general oedema, ascites, pleural 
effusion, and pericardial effusion are probably related to LT treatment as it contains 
Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers, which have been associated with events of effusion and oedema. 
Most of the events of effusions and oedema were non-serious, but serious events were reported for 
pleural effusion (1.9%) and pericardial effusion (0.9%). The underlying cause of these events is 
unknown but may include vascular leak syndrome.   
In summary, 5 patients experienced 7 serious adverse events of pleural and/or pericardial effusion; 
3 patients experienced pleural effusion; 1 patient experienced pericardial effusion; and 1 patient 
experienced both pleural and pericardial effusion. One patient experienced 2 serious TEAEs of pleural 
effusion, and another patient experienced 2 serious TEAEs of both pericardial and pleural effusion. One 
event of pleural effusion was assessed by the investigator as unlikely related to study treatment, while 
the remaining events were assessed as related to study treatment. After request, the applicant 
clarified that all SAEs of effusions and/or oedema were considered related to treatment with LT. 
Fatigue was observed in ~30% of the patients, but grade 3 or higher events were rare (2.3%). This is 
to be expected, also considering the underlying disease. 
LFT /liver function tests were increased overall in ~45% of the patients, including GGT (35.8%), 
blood alkaline phosphatase increased (19.1%), AST increased (15.8%) and ALT increased (16.3%). 
Grade 3 events were observed in 17.7% and grade 4 in 1.9% of the patients. Again, the high-grade 
events were rarely observed and no cases of hepatic failure were reported.  
Pain was selected as an AESI, but only abdominal pain is reported as a common AE (11.6%) and 
2.8% of the patients reported grade 3 events of pain. These grade 3 events consisted of facial pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, neck pain, and non-cardiac chest pain (1 patient each). Hence, this was rare 
events, that may also have been related to manifestations from the underlying disease.  
Skin reactions and nail disorders were commonly observed (46.5%), but grade 3 events were rare 
(3.7%), and there were no grade 4 or 5 events. The events mainly consisted of: rash (20.0%) and 
pruritus (11.6%), while a few grade 3 events of erythema, exfoliative rash, rash maculopapular, and 
rash pustular (1 patient each) were observed. 3 patients had a grade 3 photosensitivity reaction, and 2 
patients had grade 3 rash. Overall, most events were in the skin and were related to treatment with 
LT. The applicant has clarified that skin toxicity was handled at the discretion of the investigator. Oral 
steroid therapy was administered to 17 (7.9%) patients, topical steroid therapy was administered to 
38 (17.7%) patients, other topical therapies were administered to 27 (12.6%) patients, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 118/157 
 
 
 
anti-pruritic therapy was administered to 20 (9.3%) patients. The applicant reiterates that skin toxicity 
was an uncommon cause of treatment discontinuation (1.4%).  
Other safety findings: 
Cardiac events: 
It is noted that Torsade de points, cardiac arrest, QT prolonged and syncope are also reported. The 
applicant has clarified that a medical review of the clinical events of Torsade de points, cardiac arrest, 
QT prolonged and syncope does not suggest a safety signal associated with these events. Moreover, 
pharmacologic exposure-response analysis for QTc prolongation demonstrated no clinically relevant 
effect apparent with loncastuximab tesirine. Hence, these events are not considered to be of special 
interest with loncastuximab tesirine, but will continue to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance, 
which is acceptable.  
Phototoxicity: 
The applicant has provided the requested detailed discussion on the risk of phototoxicity; and the 
argumentation regarding plausible mechanisms and non-clinical observations raised from toxicology 
studies are acceptable. With current knowledge of this toxicity, the updated text in the SmPC is now 
considered clear and acceptable. Moreover, phototoxicity has been included as an Important Identified 
Risk in the Risk Management Plan.

SAEs grade 3 or higher 
Among the 215 patients who received 150 µg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy, for the most 
common serious TEAEs, the incidence of grade 3 or higher events and those assessed as 
treatment-related, respectively, were: disease progression, grade 5 (1.9% and 0%); DLBCL, grade 5 
(1.4% and 0%); sepsis, grade 5 (0.9% and 0%) and grade 3 (0.5% and 0%); lung infection, grade 5 
(0.5% and 0.5%) and grade 3 (0.5% and 0.5%); acute kidney injury, grade 5 (0.5% and 0%) and 
grade 3 (0.9% and 0%); hypercalcaemia, grade 4 (0.9% and 0%) and grade 3 (1.9% and 0.5%); 
abdominal pain, grade 4 (0.5% and 0%) and grade 3 (0.9% and 0.5%); pericardial effusion, grade 4 
(0.5% and 0.5%) and grade 3 (0.5% and 0.5%); febrile neutropenia, grade 3 (3.3% and 2.8%); 
pleural effusion, grade 3 (1.4% and 1.4%); dyspnoea and anaemia, grade 3 (0.9% and 0.9% each); 
noncardiac chest pain, grade 3 (0.5% and 0.5%); and pyrexia, grade 3 (0.5% and 0%). Mental status 
changes did not have any events grade 3 or higher. 
Serious adverse events of all grades were observed in 40.5% of the 215 patients of interest. Most 
commonly observed were: febrile neutropenia (3.3%), hypercalcaemia (2.8%), and pyrexia (2.3%). 
The grade 3 or higher SAEs has been summarised in the text above and it is noted and agreed that not 
all of these are treatment-related. The observed level of SAEs and treatment-related SAEs are 
acceptable considering the treatment setting and the underlying disease.

Of the relevant 215 patients in the current safety database, 67.4% of the patients had died and 52.1% 
of disease progression. Table 42 has been updated to move the 4 patients who died from disease 
progression, which was reported as an adverse event from ‘Other’ category to ‘Disease progression’ 
category. They include 1 patient from Study ADCT-402-101 and 3 patients from Study ADCT-402-201.   
It is noted that 5 patients died due to infections and/or sepsis and that one lung infection (0.5%) was 
assessed as treatment-related. This is acceptable.  
The narratives for the patients, who received the proposed dosing of LT have been assessed and the 
conclusions on causes of death are overall agreed. Patients, who died from other causes, generally 
died after subsequent treatment, so it is agreed that these deaths were not related to treatment with 
LT.

Baseline was defined as the last nonmissing value before the initial administration of loncastuximab tesirine. CTCAE v4.0 was 
used for grading. For each parameter, patients were included only once at the maximum severity. 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; DEC = decrease; DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 
s101 = Study ADCT-402-101; s201 = Study ADCT-402-201

Haematological toxicity was common with LT. Decreases in haemoglobin was mostly of low grade 
(≤grade 2: 82%), while grade 3 decreases were observed in 12.6% of the patients.  
Decreases in leucocytes were also common of low grade (≤grade 2: 40%), but were rather commonly 
observed of grade 3 (20.5%) and grade 4 (7.9%) as well.  
Decreases in lymphocytes were observed in ~31% of grade 1 and 2, while 62% had grade 3-4 
events. 
Decreases of neutrophils were observed for grade 1-2 in 22% and 32% had grade 3-4 events. From 
figure 29, the risk of grade 3-4 events increases over time and number of doses, which makes 
clinically sense, since slower and slower bone marrow recovery may occur with added number of 
cycles. The bone marrow’s capacity to recover may also be affected by previous treatments and the 
study population was heavily pretreated. For the 150 µg/kg dose level (n=69), the patients started to 
develop Grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decrease after the first dose and most of the events happened 
within the first 4 months. Moreover, the probability of developing grade 3 or 4 neutrophil decrease at 
Months 2 and 6 was 28% and 44%, respectively. 
Decreases of platelets were most often grade 1-2 (47%) and in 20% of the cases of grade 3-4.  
Overall, the level of haematological toxicity seems manageable; however, an OC has been posed 
earlier on the handling of neutropenia with LT.

INC = increase; s101 = Study ADCT-402-101; s201 = Study ADCT-402-201 
Alkaline phosphatase (AP) increased from a mean of 100.2 U/L at baseline to a mean of 110.1 U/L at 
Cycle 1, Day 15 and decreased to a mean of 101.4 U/L at Cycle 2, Day 1. AP was increased similarly at 
Cycle 2, Day 15 to a mean of 111.4 U/L and decreased at Cycle 3, Day 1 to a mean of 102.8 U/L. 
Grade 3 increases were rarely observed (2.8%). 
ALT increased from a mean of 24.3 U/L at baseline to a mean of 29.6 U/L at Cycle 1, Day 15. ALT 
values tended to decrease between cycles and increase again after treatment. There was 3.7% grade 3 
events and 0.5% grade 4 events observed in the relevant safety population (n=215). 
AST increased from a mean of 25.8 U/L at baseline to a mean of 34.5 U/L at Cycle 1, Day 15 and a 
mean of 35.0 U/L at Cycle 2, Day 15. AST values tended to decrease between cycles and increase 
again after treatment. Grade 3 increases were rarely observed (1.9%). 
Amylase increased from a mean of 50.1 U/L at baseline to a mean of 58.7 U/L at Cycle 1, Day 15 and 
decreased to a mean of 55.8 U/L at Cycle 2, Day 1. Amylase values fluctuated across cycles. Grade 3 
increases were rarely observed (1.4%). 
Bilirubin increased from a mean of 8.51 µmol/L at baseline to a mean of 10.05 µmol/L at Cycle 1, Day 
8 and decreased to a mean of 7.74 µmol/L at Cycle 2, Day 1. Bilirubin increased again to a mean of 
8.55 µmol/L at Cycle 2, Day 15, but decreased to baseline level (mean of 8.05 µmol/L) by Cycle 3, 
Day 1. Grade 3/4 increases were rarely observed (2.3%/0.5%). 
Creatine kinase (CK) decreased from a mean of 53.6 U/L at baseline to a mean of 42.1 U/L at Cycle 1, 
Day 8, increasing to a mean of 55.6 U/L by Cycle 1, Day 15. Creatine kinase decreased again after the 
next treatment with a mean of 41.8 U/L at Cycle 2, Day 8 and increased to a mean of 57.7 U/L at 
Cycle 3, Day 1.  
Creatinine increased slightly from a mean of 79.28 µmol/L at baseline to a mean of 81.74 µmol/L at 
Cycle 1, Day 15 and decreased to baseline level (76.94 µmol/L) at Cycle 2, Day 1. Creatinine increased 
again after the next treatment to a mean of 84.51 µmol/L at Cycle 2, Day 15, decreasing to 76.60 
µmol/L at Cycle 3, Day 1. Grade 3 increases were rarely observed (1.9%). 
GGT increased from a mean of 55.0 U/L at baseline to 62.1 U/L at Cycle 1, Day 15. GGT decreased 
slightly at Cycle 2, Day 1 with a mean of 52.5 U/L and increased to a mean of 68.9 U/L at Cycle 2, 
Day 15. GGT values tended to decrease between cycles and increase following treatment. After 
Cycle 5, the mean GGT values tended to increase: Cycle 5, Day 1: 75.3 U/L, Cycle 6, Day 1: 91.0 U/L, 
Cycle 7, Day 1: 106.1 U/L and Cycle 8, Day 1: 105.5 U/L, suggesting a possible cumulative increase 
over cycles. Grade 3 increases were commonly observed (23.3%), while grade 4 events were rare

(1.9%). Hence, GGT increased often to a severe degree and the pattern observed suggest cumulative 
toxicity. Hence, TEAEs of GGT increased resulted in dose delay, dose reduction, and treatment 
withdrawal in 17.7%, 3.3%, and 8.8% of patients.  The applicant has not added information neither to 
section 4.4 of the SmPC, and this is acceptable.  
Glucose decreased from a mean of 7.45 mmol/L at baseline to 6.00 mmol/L at Cycle 1, Day 15 and 
increased by Cycle 2, Day 1 to a mean of 7.61 mmol/L. Mean glucose decreased again after Cycle 2 
treatment, but was increased by Cycle 3, Day 1.  
Lactate dehydrogenase decreased from a mean of 425.9 U/L at baseline to 386.4 U/L at Cycle 1, Day 
15. Mean values continued to decrease over time: 315.2 U/L at Cycle 3, Day 1, 287.3 U/L at Cycle 4, 
Day 1, 263.8 U/L at Cycle 5, Day 1 and 247.8 U/L at Cycle 6, Day 1. Decrease in mean and median 
lactate dehydrogenase over time could be considered associated with an antitumor effect of LT and not 
a toxicity as such. 
Lipase increased from a mean of 27.5 U/L at baseline to 35.8 U/L at Cycle 1, Day 15 and decreased to 
27.3 U/L at Cycle 2, Day 1. Median values increased again following Cycle 2 treatment and were 
decreased again by Cycle 3. Grade 3/4 increases were rarely observed (3.3%/0.9%).  
Potassium decreased from a mean of 4.20 mmol/L at baseline to a mean of 4.04 mmol/L at Cycle 1, 
Day 15, with increase at Cycle 2, Day 1 with a mean of 4.15 mmol/L. Mean potassium values 
decreased again during Cycle 2, but were increased by Cycle 3. Median and mean potassium values 
varied across cycles, and there was no evidence of a cumulative effect. 
Sodium decreased from a mean of 138.6 mmol/L at baseline to a mean of 138.0 mmol/L at Cycle 1, 
Day 8 and increased to a mean of 139.3 mmol/L at Cycle 1, Day 15. A similar trend was found for 
Cycle 2, Day 1 with a mean value of 139.4 mmol/L a mean value of 138.2 mmol/L at Cycle 2, Day 8 
and increase to a mean of 139.4 mmol/L at Cycle 2, Day 15. The changes observed are not considered 
clinically significant. 
There were no clear changes over time in: albumin, BUN, calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, 
protein and urea.  
Overall, the laboratory values seem affected to a low degree except for GGT, which were increased 
often to a severe degree and the pattern observed suggest cumulative toxicity.

Adverse events according to age (<65 years vs ≥65 years) were significantly different regarding AEs 
leading to withdrawal (18.2 vs 22.9%) and SAEs (37.3% vs 43.5%), but this is an expected finding 
and within an acceptable level, considering the pre-treated study population.

The applicant has provided the requested table of MedDRA terms and age groups. It is noted that more 
patients had peripheral oedema with increasing age, but this is within an acceptable range and are 
probably due to age-related comorbidities and not treatment with LT.

In clinical studies, loncastuximab tesirine did not induce ADAs. Of 328 patients tested, only 1 patient 
(0.305%) exhibited a positive ADA response, which occurred at post-dose only, with very low log2 titre 
(<1). 
The applicant claims that only one patient tested positive for ADAs in the clinical studies. This is 
acceptable information at this time. Please refer also to the clinical pharmacology and efficacy sections. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Clinical drug interaction studies have not been performed. In vitro assessments indicate that SG3199 is 
not a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes but is potentially metabolised via CYP3A4/5. 
SG3199 is a P-glycoprotein substrate, but not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Given the short apparent 
half-life of SG3199 in circulation and exceedingly low exposure relative to half maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) for inhibition of the various human transporter proteins, loncastuximab tesirine 
has a minimal potential for drug-drug interactions. 
No clinically important interactions are expected with LT. The provided information is acceptable; 
however, please refer also to the clinical pharmacology section.

A fifth of the patients (20.5%) had any TEAE leading to withdrawal of LT and this is considered a high 
number. The most common AEs leading to treatment withdrawal was GGT increased (8.8%), followed 
by oedema peripheral (2.8%) and thrombocytopenia (1.9%). The most common AEs leading to dose 
delay was GGT increased (17.7%), followed by neutropenia (11.2%) and thrombocytopenia (7.9%). 
The most common TEAE leading to dose reduction was GGT increased (3.3%). The high start dose for 
the first two cycles have probably increased these rates of withdrawal and dose delays, but considering 
the heavily pretreated study population and late-line treatment setting, this is acceptable. 
It is not recommended to reduce the dose of LT in case of high-grade AEs, but rather to postpone the 
next dose by e.g. a week or two. he SmPC states that if the treatment is delayed more than 3 weeks, 
the dose of LT should be reduced by 50%. The applicant has provided the clarification requested 
regarding dose-reductions. In the pivotal study ADCT-402-201, which used the proposed dosing 
regimen exclusively, 61 (42.1%) patients had a dose delay. Out of these 9 (14.8%) patients had dose 
reduction.

The table above provides the overall response rate for patients who had a dose reduction subsequently 
to dose delay at 50% of the initial dose, and for patients with a dose delay which did not require a 
dose reduction. The table shows that considerably fewer patients had a PR, while the same fraction in 
both groups obtained a CR or SD as best response. Considering the small sample size (n=9) of those 
who were dose-reduced, this difference could be due to chance and the proposed approach and update 
to the SmPC section 4.2 is acceptable. Especially since section 4.2 also states that: ‘Note: If toxicity 
requires dose reduction following the second dose of 0.15 mg/kg (Cycle 2), the patient should receive 
the dose of 0.075 mg/kg for Cycle 3.’ 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
As of the data cut-off of 01 Mar 2021, loncastuximab tesirine was not marketed in any region. No post 
marketing data are available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population of main focus is the 215 patients, who received the proposed dosing regimen i.e 
150 µg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy (LT) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles followed by 75 µg/kg 
Q3W for the subsequent cycles. Although other safety populations are reported in the dossier, the 
assessment of the safety profile of loncastuximab tesirine is primarily based on these data. Hence, the 
frequencies of adverse reactions in the SmPC section 4.8 are based on these 215 patients. Although 
the safety database is limited in sample size, this is acceptable in the context of a CMA. However, a 
planned confirmatory study will report safety of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with rituximab 
versus rituximab/gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, so the applicant was asked to justify how the safety profile 
of loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy can be confirmed by safety results from this study. The 
applicant argues that the toxicity profile of LT can be confirmed by the planned confirmatory RCT, 
although rituximab is added to LT, because the toxicity profile of rituximab is well-characterised with 
minimal overlap with the toxicity profile of loncastuximab tesirine and this is agreed. 
Considering that the median treatment duration among these 215 patients was 45.0 days (range: 1 to 
569 days) and the median number of treatment cycles administered was 3.0 cycles (range: 1 to 26 
cycles), the applicant has committed to provide the final CSR for the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 as a 
specific obligation post-authorisation.

Almost all of the patients in the studies 101 and 201 experienced at least one adverse event (AE) 
from the relevant safety data base (n=215). The most frequently observed events were GGT increased 
(35.8%), neutropenia (34.9%), fatigue (30.2%), anaemia (28.8%), thrombocytopenia (28.4%), 
nausea (26.5%), oedema peripheral (23.3%), cough (20.9%), rash (20.0%), blood alkaline 
phosphatase increased (19.1%), diarrhoea (17.7%), pyrexia and hypokalaemia (16.7% each), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased and constipation (16.3% each), dyspnoea and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased (15.8% each), vomiting (15.3%), decreased appetite (14.4%), 
pleural effusion (13.5%), hypomagnesaemia (13.0%), abdominal pain and pruritus (11.6% each), and 
hypophosphataemia (11.2%). 
Grade 3 or higher adverse events were also very common (74.4%), and those often reported were 
(grade 3 and >grade 3): neutropenia (24.2% and 20.0%), GGT increased (17.2% and 13.5%), 
thrombocytopenia (15.8% and 9.8%), anaemia (11.6% and 6.5%) and neutrophil count decreased 
(3.3% and 2.8%). 
Treatment-related adverse events (ADRs) were observed in the majority of patients i.e. 81.9%, of 
which 51.2% had a grade 3 or higher ADR. The most common ADRs of all grades were GGT increased 
(28.8%), neutropenia (26.0%), fatigue (20.9%), rash (19.5%), oedema peripheral and nausea 
(16.7% each), thrombocytopenia (16.3%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (14.9%), anaemia 
(13.5%), AST increased (11.6%) and pleural effusion and ALT increased (11.2% each). The most 
frequently observed grade 3 or higher ADRs were neutropenia (24.2%), GGT increased (17.2%), 
thrombocytopenia (15.8%), anaemia (11.6%), and neutrophil count decreased (3.3%). It is noted that 
neutropenia was observed in a third of the patients (34.9%) and of grade 3 or higher in 24.2% of the 
patients, but only 3.3% had febrile neutropenia. The risk of neutropenia with LT is considered 
adequately reflected in the SmPC.   
Regarding the laboratory data, the observed increase in GGT was further discussed by the applicant. 
However, it is concluded that increased GGT resulted in dose delay, dose reduction, and treatment 
withdrawal in 17.7%, 3.3%, and 8.8% of patients. 
Adverse events of special interest included oedema or effusion, fatigue, increased liver function 
tests (LFT), pain, skin reactions and nail disorders. Of main interest in the assessment of the safety 
profile is the high rate of oedema or effusions (36.3%) and the 23.3% of the patients, who had 
peripheral oedema (grade 3: 1.4%) and/or pleural effusions (all grades: 13.5% / grade 3: 0.4%). The 
applicant has clarified that the events of effusions and oedema reported in patients receiving 
loncastuximab tesirine in clinical studies are probably related to LT treatment as it contains 
Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers, which have been associated with events of effusion and oedema. 
Most of the events of effusions and oedema were non-serious, but serious events were reported for 
pleural effusion (1.9%) and pericardial effusion (0.9%). The underlying cause of these events is 
unknown but may include vascular leak syndrome. In summary, 5 patients experienced 7 serious 
adverse events of pleural and/or pericardial effusion; 3 patients experienced pleural effusion; 1 patient 
experienced pericardial effusion; and 1 patient experienced both pleural and pericardial effusion. All 
events of pleural effusion were assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment. The 
proposed text in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 was agreed. Events of oedema and effusion will continue to be 
closely monitored in the ongoing clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance and these ADRs have 
been classified as an important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Additionally, skin reactions and nail disorders were commonly observed (46.5%), but grade 3 
events were rare (3.7%) and there were no grade 4 or 5 events. The events mainly consisted of: rash 
(20.0%) and pruritus (11.6%) and most events were in the skin and were related to treatment with 
LT.

The applicant has provided the requested detailed discussion on the risk of phototoxicity; and the 
argumentation regarding plausible mechanisms and non-clinical observations raised from toxicology 
studies are acceptable. With current knowledge of this toxicity, the updated text in the SmPC is 
considered clear and acceptable. Moreover, phototoxicity has been included as an Important Identified 
Risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 40.5%, most commonly febrile neutropenia 
(3.3%), hypercalcaemia (2.8%), and pyrexia (2.3%). Not all of the SAEs are considered treatment-
related and the observed incidences are acceptable considering the treatment setting and the 
underlying disease. 
Deaths in the safety database were mostly due to disease progression (52.1%). Five patients died due 
to treatment-related AEs, such as infections and/or sepsis and one died of lung infection. The 
narratives for the patients, who received the proposed dosing of LT have been assessed and the 
conclusions on causes of death are overall agreed. Patients, who died from other causes, generally 
died after subsequent treatment and it is agreed that these deaths were not related to treatment with 
LT. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs was 20.5%, most often due to GGT increased (8.8%), 
followed by oedema peripheral (2.8%) and thrombocytopenia (1.9%). This is a rather high rate, and 
may be due to the policy not to reduce the dose, but rather to delay the next dose in case of 
unacceptable toxicity. This approach has been clarified in section 4.2 of the SmPC. However, the rate 
of discontinuations is considered acceptable for the proposed indication and targeted patient 
population. 
Since the start dose in the first 2 cycles is double (150 µg/kg iv) the dose for the subsequent cycles 
(75 µg/kg iv) according to the recommended dosing regimen, the safety profile of the individual dose 
is considered difficult to assess, although there is considered to be a dose-toxicity relationship. 
Therefore, it is not possible to differentiate between what toxicities are from the size of the dose or 
from cumulative toxicity from the continued use of LT. 
Since it is expected that at least some infusion-related reactions are observed with an ADC such as LT 
after longer exposure, this will be a focus in the assessment of the final CSR. Overall, the pattern of 
toxicity with LT is considered acceptable and in line with other antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).  
Overall, the pattern of toxicity with LT seems acceptable and in line with the toxicity profile of other 
antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Currently, the safety profile observed with LT is considered partly 
due to adverse drug effects, especially the increased GGT and peripheral oedema and pleural effusions. 
However, the gastrointestinal and haematological toxicity can also be related to either the underlying 
disease or late effects of prior treatments in this heavily pre-treated population. Relevant information 
on clinical safety has been appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety profile of LT seems in line with other antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and 
the most common adverse reactions are oedema/effusions, gastrointestinal and haematological 
toxicity. The current safety database is acceptable for a CMA.  
The following measures are necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a 
conditional MA: The final CSR for the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 and the final CSR from the Phase 3 
study ADCT-402-311, n=330 will be submitted.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two 
or more lines of systemic therapy.  
The definitions of relapsed and refractory are those of the International Working Group (IWG) response 
criteria (Cheson et al., 2007).  
The aim of the therapy with Zynlonta is to improve overall response rate (ORR) in patients with 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL who have received at least 2 prior systemic lines of therapy, although 
complete response rate (CRR) is considered more clinically relevant in this non-curative setting.  The 
targeted disease is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and accounts for 25% 
to 45% of all NHL cases worldwide. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
DLBCL is an aggressive disease with short life expectancy if left untreated. With currently available 
treatments, around 50% of newly diagnosed patients can be cured. The prognosis of patients whose 
disease is refractory to initial chemotherapy and therefore not eligible for high-dose therapy and 
autologous stem cell transplant (HD-ASCT), or who relapse early after HD-ASCT, is extremely poor. 
Few patients exhibit responses to salvage therapy, with an ORR of 26% (CR rate 7%) to the next line 
of therapy and a median survival of approximately 6 months (Crump, 2017).  
Possible treatment options include a second HD-ASCT, allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), 
participation in clinical trials with novel drugs, or palliative care (ESMO, NCCN guidelines). Despite 
recently approved new treatment modalities (such as Polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) and Tafasitamab 
(Minjuvi), no treatment is considered standard of care. Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for 
patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted on loncastuximab tesirine is the pivotal phase 2 study ADCT-
402-201 (Study 201, also named LOTIS-2 n=145), a multicentre, open-label, single-arm study that 
evaluated its efficacy and safety in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The primary endpoint of 
the trial was ORR as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) using Lugano 2014 criteria. 
Secondary endpoints were IRC-DOR, IRC-PFS and OS.  
Results from the phase 1 study ADCT-402-101 (Study 101, n=137) that assessed dose escalation and 
expansion are considered supportive. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study ADCT-402-201:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 148/157 
 
 
 
• 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study, IRC-assessed ORR was 48.3% (70/145 patients; 
95% CI: 39.9, 56.7), and complete response (CR) was 24.1% (35/145 patients, 95% CI:17.4, 
31.9). The median duration of response (DOR) for the responding subjects was 13.37 months 
(95% CI: 6.87, NE). Median time-to-response (TTR) was 41 days (range 35-247 days). 
•  Median PFS in the overall population was 4.93 months (95% CI: 2.89, 8.31) and median OS 
was 9.53 months (95% CI: 6.93, 11.47).  
• 
The applicant presented sensitivity analyses implementing the following censoring rules: 
Progressive disease (PD)/death after new anticancer therapies other than transplant are 
counted as events and PD/death after stem cell transplant (SCT) are censored at the last valid 
assessment date before the transplant. The results were consistent with those reported in the 
CSR. 
•  A total of 12 patients received SCT directly following loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Eleven 
patients received SCT as consolidation therapy after responding to loncastuximab tesirine. 
These patients underwent SCT without intervening therapy. One patient went directly to 
allogeneic SCT after progression following loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Out of the 12 
patients, 5 died at some point after transplant (2 of disease progression and 3 of other 
reasons). It is rather encouraging that LT may also constitute a bridge towards SCT at this 
late-line stage.  
Study ADCT-402-101: 
In the supportive dose- escalation phase I study 402-101, ORR was 42.3%, and median DOR in 
responders was 4.5 months. Median PFS was 2.8 months and median OS 7.46 months. Median TTR 
was 43 days. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Notwithstanding that efficacy results from the pivotal trial are encouraging, the uncontrolled 
nature and limited duration of follow-up of the pivotal trial limits interpretation and 
extrapolation of data. 
•  Although Study 101 was a dose escalation study, the considerable difference between the 
pivotal and the supportive study in terms of median DOR (13.4 vs. 4.5 months, respectively) 
and median PFS (4.9 vs. 2.8 months) is not understood, especially since the ORR results are 
similar and the patients in the two studies seem to be comparable in their baseline 
characteristics. It was acknowledged that the numerically higher DOR, PFS, and OS in diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Study 201 as compared to those treated in 
Study 101 likely reflect the fact that all patients treated in Study 201 received the optimal 
dosing regimen of loncastuximab tesirine with the planned reduction after Cycle 2, which 
provides consistent efficacious exposure. 
• 
In study 201 16 patients received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy at some 
time after progression following loncastuximab tesirine therapy. Out of these 16 patients, 10 
died at some time after CAR-T therapy (9 of disease progression and 1 of other reasons). 
Although LT may facilitate bridging to CAR-T treatment, the efficacy of this treatment after LT 
needs further exploration. 
In the context of a CMA, the applicant needs to submit the results from a confirmatory study within 
a reasonable timeframe to corroborate the efficacy and safety of Zynlonta. The applicant has 
initiated study ADCT-402-311, which is a phase 3, controlled, randomised study of loncastuximab

tesirine combined with the CD-20-targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab (Lonca-R) versus 
standard immunochemotherapy (rituximab / gemcitabine / oxaliplatin) in patients with R/R DLBCL. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients in the studies 101 and 201 experienced at least one AE from the relevant 
safety data base (n=215). The most frequently observed events were GGT increased (35.8%), 
neutropenia (34.9%), fatigue (30.2%), anaemia (28.8%), thrombocytopenia (28.4%), nausea 
(26.5%), oedema peripheral (23.3%), cough (20.9%), rash (20.0%), blood alkaline phosphatase 
increased (19.1%), diarrhoea (17.7%), pyrexia and hypokalaemia (16.7% each), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased and constipation (16.3% each), dyspnoea and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased (15.8% each), vomiting (15.3%), decreased appetite (14.4%), 
pleural effusion (13.5%), hypomagnesaemia (13.0%), abdominal pain and pruritus (11.6% each), and 
hypophosphataemia (11.2%). 
Grade 3 or higher adverse events were also very common (74.4%), and those often reported were 
(grade 3 and >grade 3): neutropenia (24.2% and 20.0%), GGT increased (17.2% and 13.5%), 
thrombocytopenia (15.8% and 9.8%), anaemia (11.6% and 6.5%) and neutrophil count decreased 
(3.3% and 2.8%). 
Treatment-related adverse events (ADRs) were observed in the majority of patients i.e. 81.9%, of 
which 51.2% had a grade 3 or higher ADR. The most common ADRs of all grades were GGT increased 
(28.8%), neutropenia (26.0%), fatigue (20.9%), rash (19.5%), oedema peripheral and nausea 
(16.7% each), thrombocytopenia (16.3%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (14.9%), anaemia 
(13.5%), AST increased (11.6%) and pleural effusion and ALT increased (11.2% each).  
Adverse events of special interest included oedema or effusion, fatigue, increased liver function 
tests (LFT), pain, skin reactions and nail disorders. Of particular interest in the assessment of the 
safety profile is the high rate of oedema or effusions (36.3%): peripheral oedema (23.3% of which 
grade 3: 1.4%) and/or pleural effusions (all grades: 13.5% of which grade 3: 0.4%).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 40.5%, most commonly febrile neutropenia 
(3.3%), hypercalcaemia (2.8%), and pyrexia (2.3%). Not all of the SAEs are considered treatment-
related and the observed incidences are acceptable considering the treatment setting and the 
underlying disease. 
Deaths in the safety database were mostly due to disease progression (50.2%). Five patients died due 
to treatment-related AEs, such as infections and/or sepsis and one died of lung infection.  
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs was 20.5%, most often due to GGT increased (8.8%), 
followed by oedema peripheral (2.8%) and thrombocytopenia (1.9%).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The median treatment duration among the 215 patients in the safety data base was 45.0 days (range: 
1 to 569 days) and the median number of treatment cycles administered was 3.0 cycles (range: 1 to 
26 cycles), which was considered limited. Therefore the applicant has committed to provide the final 
CSR for the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 as a specific obligation post-authorisation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite several recent approvals for patients with R/R DLBCL, no standard treatment exists and the 
prognosis remains poor. For these patients, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
treatment guidelines recommend stem cell transplant, participation in clinical studies, or palliative 
care.

The efficacy results of Zylonta in a group of patients with relapse of refractory high-grade DLBCL are 
considered relevant and indicate a clinically meaningful favourable effect. Most responses occurred 
after 2 doses of LT and were durable. Response rates from the phase I dose escalation trial were 
supportive, although the median DOR in this group was considerably lower.   
The main uncertainties regarding the benefit-risk assessment relate to the short duration of follow-up, 
the limitations associated with the single arm trial design and the difference in DOR and PFS between 
the pivotal study and the supportive study. Specific obligations are in place (see Annex II) to resolve 
these uncertainties. 
The applicant has compared LT to approved and recommended therapies in R/R DLBCL utilizing a 
matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) with historical data. Considering the limitations of these 
cross-study comparisons, it is considered that LT monotherapy fulfills an unmet need based on the 
efficacy results. 
The most important safety concerns are related to bone marrow toxicity. Febrile neutropenia was also 
noted and it should be clarified if B-cell depletion was observed and could have an impact on number 
of infections. Adverse events of special interest included oedema or effusion which have been further 
characterised, and the risk of oedema and effusions are now listed as an important identified risk in the 
RMP. For completeness regarding the assessment of safety, the applicant has committed to provide the 
final CSR for the pivotal study ADCT-402-201 as a specific obligation post-authorisation. Overall, the 
safety profile of LT is in line with other antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and seems generally 
manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R of treatment with Loncastuximab Tesirine is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission.  
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. In 
addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant will conduct a randomised Phase 3 study ADCT-402-311 of loncastuximab tesirine 
and the CD-20-targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab (Lonca-R) versus standard 
immunochemotherapy (rituximab / gemcitabine / oxaliplatin) in patients with R/R DLBCL to provide 
comprehensive and confirmatory clinical data following a CMA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/834750/2022  
Page 152/157 
 
 
 
According to the protocol of confirmatory Phase 3 trial LOTIS-5, target enrolment for Part 2 is 330 
subjects, aiming for final PFS analysis at 263 events, estimated at approximately 6 months after 
completing enrolment.  
The applicant has reported that initial data from the safety run-in did not reveal new signals 
relative to the safety profile of LT + rituximab and Part 2 is ongoing: Up to August 2022, a total of 
50 patients have been recruited, out of which 20 belonged to the safety run-in (Part 1, took place 
in 4 countries only), and the rest to the actual randomised phase (Part 2). Overall, considering the 
confirmatory trial timeline (due date for provision of efficacy and safety results is Q4 2025), its 
feasibility seems endorsed by the fact that current enrolment is taking place at 63 study sites in 12 
countries, and more sites are expected to open across other countries in the EU and Latin America. 
Additionally, the applicant has committed to providing the final CSR for pivotal study ADCT-402-
201 as a specific obligation (see Annex II). 
•  Unmet medical need will be addressed, as: 
Currently, many patients with R/R DLBCL will receive treatment with chemotherapy regimens 
which are composed of one or more chemotherapy agents not specifically approved for use in 
DLBCL. In the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines treatment options for 3rd 
line therapy is limited to allogenic transplant (if eligible), clinical trials with novel drugs, or 
palliative care. Similarly, the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines for the 
treatment of B-cell lymphoma lists several combinations that can be used in R/R DLBCL (NCCN 
2021). However, the response to many of these regimens is low and short-lived. A recent analysis 
of patients requiring treatment for R/R DLBCL revealed that patients receiving 3rd line treatment 
had a response rate of 27%, and the ORR for patients who were refractory of last treatment at 
21.2%. Response rates were even poorer in patients who received ≥4th line, with <10% of 
patients responding to therapy (Radford 2019). In addition, the overall survival for these patients 
is quite short, with a median of approximately 6 months (Radford 2019, Halwani et al 2019). 
Several treatments for R/R B-NHL and R/R DLBCL, respectively, have been approved in the 
European Union in recent years: 
Pixantrone ([Pixuvri] as monotherapy) received the indication: Monotherapy for the treatment 
of adult patients with multiply R/R aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL). The 
benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used as 5th line or 
greater chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy. ORR in NHL reaches 40%, 
with ORR in patients previously receiving rituximab even lower at 32% 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/pixuvri-epar-product-
information_en.pdf-). Clinically relevant adverse reactions include myelosuppression, 
cardiotoxicity and infections. 
Two CAR-T therapies, Yescarta and Kymriah, have been approved in patients with R/R DLBCL 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The ORR for these therapies ranged from 53.5% 
to 72%, with a CR rate ranging from 40% to 51%. Median DOR was not estimable (Yescarta) 
and not reached (Kymriah) (Yescarta SmPC 2021, Kymriah SmPC 2021). They both show 
substantial toxicity, with 57% to 93% of patients having adverse drug reactions of cytokine 
release syndrome (11% to 23% Grade 3 or higher), and 20% to 58% having encephalopathy 
(11% to 31% Grade 3 or higher) (Yescarta SmPC 2021, Kymriah SmPC 2021). Further CAR-T 
therapies are only available at specialised centres and up to 30% of eligible patients may not 
be able to receive the planned therapy, either due to manufacturing problems or rapid disease 
progression.

Polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) in combination with bendamustine + rituximab has been 
approved for the treatment of R/R DLBCL patients who are not candidates for haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant. The primary endpoint (CR rate at primary response assessment (6-8 
weeks after Cycle 6 Day 1 or last dose of study medication, based on PET-CT, IRC assessed) 
was increased in the pola+BR arm: 40.0% (16/40 patients; 95% CI: [24.9%, 56.7%]) vs 
17.5% in the BR arm (7/40 patients; 95% CI: [7.3%, 32.8%]). The Δ was 22.5%, statistically 
significant and in favour of pola+BR (95% CI: 2.6%, 40.2%; p =0.0261, Cochran Mantel-
Haenszel [CMH] chi-square). The most frequently reported (≥ 30%) ADRs (all grades) in 
patients treated with Polivy plus BR in previously treated DLBCL were neutropenia (45.7%), 
diarrhoea (35.8%), nausea (33.1%), thrombocytopenia (32.5%), anaemia (31.8%) and 
neuropathy peripheral (30.5%) 
Tafasitamab ([Minjuvi] in combination with lenalidomide) followed by Minjuvi monotherapy 
recently received a CMA for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL who are not 
eligible for ASCT. In a single-arm study in 81 adults with R/R DLBCL ORR of 56.8%, with a CRR 
of 39.5%, and a median overall DOR of 34.6 months. Toxicity was substantial, and Grade 3 or 
4 adverse drug reactions included neutropenia (49%), thrombocytopenia (17%), and febrile 
neutropenia (12%). Grade 3 or 4 infections were seen in 28% of patients (Minjuvi) SmPC 
2021). 
In conclusion, available treatments show substantial toxicities, and response rates ranging from 40% 
to 70%, meaning that up to 60% of patients will not respond. Also, more than 50% of patients will not 
have a durable response. In addition, R/R DLBCL patients with high-risk characteristics such as 
primary refractory disease and double-hit / triple-hit disease have not been studied throughout. Thus, 
therapeutic alternatives in R/R DLBCL, especially with a different mechanism of action, to fulfil the 
unmet medical need are still required. With an IRC-assessed ORR of 48.3% and CR of 24.1% and a 
DOR for the responding subjects of 13.37 months loncastuximab tesirine, with its new mechanism of 
action (in the treatment of DLBCL) as well as its immediate availability, is considered to fulfil this 
unmet medical need. Therefore, Loncastuximab tesirine can be considered a major therapeutic 
advantage in the proposed target population for whom there are very limited and often no other 
treatment options available, in particular when available options are unlikely to be efficacious, or when 
it is the preferred option in view of its efficacy and safety profiles. 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: given the positive benefit risk, the poor prognosis in R/R DLBCL 
patients having received at least two prior systemic therapies and the fact that the different MOA leads 
to a favourable safety profile. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Zynlonta is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Zynlonta is not similar to Kymriah, Yescarta, Polivy, 
Minjuvi within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Zynlonta is favourable in the following indication: 
Zynlonta as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Zynlonta in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the phototoxicity risk minimisation material, including 
communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the 
National Competent Authority. 
An additional risk minimisation material is aimed at reducing the risk of photosensitivity reactions.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Zynlonta is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe Zynlonta and all patients who are expected to use 
Zynlonta are provided with the following risk minimisation material: 
•

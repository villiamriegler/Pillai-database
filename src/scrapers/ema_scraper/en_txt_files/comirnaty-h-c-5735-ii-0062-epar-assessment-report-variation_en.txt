2.  Introduction 
In a correspondence to New England Journal of Medicine, Kamar et al (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion 
O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med 
2021;385:661-2. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2108861) reported findings from a retrospective study of 
administration of a 3rd dose of Comirnaty in solid-organ transplant recipients who had received 2 
doses, 1 month apart. 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) submitted a variation to include information regarding a 3rd 
vaccination dose in immunocompromised patients in Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the EU SmPC, to 
align the EU SmPC with information included in United States Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Fact 
Sheets. 
3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
A weak immune response to two doses of vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been observed in the immunosuppressed recipients of solid-organ 
transplants. Severe cases of COVID-19 have been reported in transplant recipients who had received 
two doses of vaccine.3 These reports prompted the French National Authority for Health to recommend 
the use of a third dose in immunosuppressed patients.  
According to French law, because the data reported by Kamar et al was an anonymous retrospective 
study, institutional review board approval was not required.  
The author of the publication has kindly provided a table of data to confirm the publication. As there 
was no study protocol the publication is more of a case series than a clinical study.  
3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The basis of this application is a retrospective case series. There is no study protocol. 
The levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were assessed in all the patients at one-month 
post dose 3, with the use of the Wantai enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Beijing Wantai Biological 
Pharmacy Enterprise). 
Wantai microplate ELISA that detect total anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) (WANTAI 
SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA). Semi-quantitative results are expressed as signal-to cut-off ratio (S/C0). 
Patients were defined as positive if S/Co> 1.1.  
Samples with a S/C0> 47 were retested after dilution. Using this assay, the research group has 
previously reported a 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in immunocompetent patients tested at 2 
to 14 days post symptom-onset and at 15 to 45 days post symptom-onset, suggesting it as the ability 
to detect low level of antibodies. 
The operative characteristics are published in:  
Abravanel F, Miédouge M, Chapuy-Regaud S, Mansuy J-M, Izopet J. Clinical performance of a rapid test 
compared to a microplate test to detect total anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed to the spike protein. 
J Clin Virol 2020; 130: 104528. 
This ELISA test bases on the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The immunoassay was used to test 30 
negative sera collected in 2019 at Toulouse hospital and 69 serum collected from PCR-confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The COVID-19 infected patients provided 40 samples collected 2–14 
days post symptom-onset (group 1) and 29 collected 15–45 days post symptom-onset or after contact 
with a positive case, including 3 asymptomatic patients (group 2). All 30 negative samples tested 
negative with the assay, corresponding to 100 % specificity (confidence interval 95 %, (CI 95 %): 
82.1–100 %). The overall sensitivity of the ELISA test was 100 % (69/69) (CI 95 %: 88.2–100 %, p < 
0.01) (Table 1). The ELISA test was 100 % sensitive (40/40) (CI 95 %: 84.5–100 %, p = 0.01). 
Similarly, the ELISA test was 100 % sensitive (29/29) (CI 95 %: 81.8–100 %, p = 0.49) when tested 
on the 29 group 2 samples. The 2 group 2 samples that tested negative with the Wantai rapid test had 
low index values (< 8) when tested with the Wantai ELISA assay and these samples were from 2 of the 
3 asymptomatic patients. The research group therefore find that the Wantai ELISA assay has excellent 
specificity and sensitive. 
The method used to detect antibodies are commercially available test kits. The results should not be 
compared to the results from clinical studies perfomed by the MAH, using in-house methods. There is 
currently no immune correlate of protection established in healthy subjects or in immunocompromised 
subjects.  
Conduct of the study and study population 
When the vaccination campaign started (7 January 2021), all transplant-patients in Toulouse were 
invited to be vaccinated. Due to weak immunogenicity of 2 doses of mRNA based anti-SARS-CoV-2 
 
 
vaccines, the French National Authority for Health recommended (4 April 2021) the use of a third dose 
in immunosuppressed patients. This dose was to be given at least one month after the second dose or 
as soon as possible, in patients in whom the second dose had been administrated more than one 
month before this latter recommendation. Hence, all seropositive or seronegative transplant patients 
were invited to receive the third dose.  
According to the recommendations of the Francophone Society of Transplantation, anti-SARS-CoV-2 
spike protein antibodies were monitored before and after vaccination. Furthermore, the French 
authorities recommended that anti–SARS-CoV-2 serology be performed in immunosuppressed 
patients. Therefore, all study patients were also invited to perform a serology according to the national 
recommendations. Serology was performed at one month after the third dose according to the 
publication.  
In the published letter retrospectively the outcome of the first 101 consecutive patients who have been 
given 3 doses and who have had their anti–SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies assessed was 
collected. According to French law, anonymous retrospective studies do not require institutional review 
board approval.  
3.2.  Results 
The case series consists of 101 consecutive solid-organ transplant recipients (mean [±SD] age, 58±2 
years; 69% were men) who were given three doses of the messenger RNA vaccine Comirnaty 
(BNT162b2, Pfizer–BioNTech). The group included 78 kidney-transplant recipients, 12 liver-transplant 
recipients, 8 lung-transplant or heart-transplant recipients, and 3 pancreas-transplant recipients (Table 
1). 
The first two doses were given 1 month apart, and the third dose was administered approximately 2 
months after the second dose (median 63 days range:35-83 days). The time between transplantation 
and the initiation of vaccination was 97±8 months. Immunosuppression was due to the use of 
glucocorticoids (in 87% of patients), calcineurin inhibitors (in 79% of patients), mycophenolic acid (in 
63% of patients), mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (in 30% of patients),and belatacept (in 
12% of patients). (Table 1) 
The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0% (0 of 101 patients) before the 1st dose, 4% (4 
of 101 patients) before the 2nd dose, 40% (40 of 99 patients) before the 3rd dose and 68% (67 of 
99 patients) 4 weeks after the 3rd dose. 
Among the 59 patients who had been seronegative before the 3rd dose, 26 were seropositive at 4 
weeks after the 3rd dose. All 40 patients who had been seropositive before the 3rd dose were still 
seropositive 4 weeks later; their antibody titers increased from 36±12 before the 3rd dose to 
2676±350 one month after the 3rd dose (p<0.001). 
The research group compared responders to non-responders after 3-doses vaccine (table 1). Non-
responders were older, had a lower total lymphocyte count, a lower CD4-positive Tcell count, a lower 
CD19-positive count, and a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate before vaccination compared to 
responders. The proportion of patients given belatacept was higher among non-responders. 
Table 1 (supplementary appendix to publication). Clinical and biological characteristics of 
solid organ transplant recipients according to humoral response one month after three 
doses of mRNA-based vaccine. 
According to the correspondence, none of the patients had developed COVID-19 after receiving the 3rd 
dose of Comirnaty. The duration of follow-up is unknown. Therefore, this is non-informative. 
 
 
3.3.  Discussion of efficacy 
The current submission aims to include data in the SmPC regarding immunocompromised subjects. It 
is agreed that this is a group at increased risk of severe COVID-19.  
The current submission contains data from a publication of a case series of vaccinated subjects who 
had previously undergone a solid organ transplant. Antibodies were measured using a commercially 
available kit which measures binding antibodies in contrast to the methods used in clinical trials 
performed by the MAH which measure neutralising antibodies. Results are therefore not directly 
comparable to the already available serology results from healthy subjects. 
Serostatus was determined at one month after the third dose. Semi-quantitative results are expressed 
as signal-to cut-off ratio (S/C0). Patients were defined as positive if S/Co> 1.1. This metric has no 
relation to any immune correlate of protection, which has not been defined either for healthy subjects 
or for the immunocompromised. 
The data indicate that an additional dose given to immunocompromised subjects increases the 
frequency of sero-responders, as defined above. The clinical relevance of the increased frequency is 
unknown as no efficacy data are available. However, given the medical need for protection it is a 
reasonable assumption that a third dose could be given to this vulnerable group. It seems to be 
already the case in clinical practice in several countries including France.  
Based on previous experience of vaccination of adolescents the results can be extrapolated to subjects 
down to 12 years of age with similar immunosuppression. Immune responses are not expected to be 
lower in adolescents compared to adults.  
The practice of Kamar et al 2021 are considered illustrative of what may be considered reasonable 
clinical management.  
 
Overall, a third dose could be justified based on individual benefit-risk considerations and may be 
given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. The time interval between the second and 
the third dose should be at least 28 days. 
4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The provided submission does not state how safety data was collected.  
4.2.  Results 
No reactogenicity data were provided. The only safety information available is the statement of the 
authors that no serious adverse reactions occurred, and that no acute reactions were reported until the 
publication date. The duration of follow-up is unknown.  
4.3.  Discussion 
The safety information provided is very limited. The only available information is that no SAE occurred 
within an unspecified period after a third dose was given to 101 solid organ transplant recipients. The 
safety profile of a third dose in this populations is likely acceptable. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC are updated to introduce a third dose of 
Comirnaty for individuals 12 years of age and older who are severely immunocompromised. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly (see Attachment 1). 
6.  Request for supplementary information 
6.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
The suggested additions to the SmPC are not agreed as discussed above. We suggest the following 
statement in section 4.2:  
Immunocompromised population 
A third dose may be given at least 28 days after the second dose in patients not anticipated to achieve 
a sufficient vaccine response due to profound immunosuppression (see section 4.4.) 
The MAH is invited to comment on this proposal.  
7.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
8.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The current submission aims to include a recommendation for a third dose in immunosuppressed 
subjects, along with data on serological response in subjects on immunosuppressive treatment after 
solid organ transplant. This is a group at increased risk of severe COVID-19. 
The variation is based on a case series of vaccinated subjects who had undergone a solid organ 
transplant previously, and who received a third dose of Comirnaty one month after the second dose 
(Kamar et al, 2021). Some of these patients were sero-responders after two doses; some were not.  
Anti-Sars-Cov2 antibodies were measured before a third dose, and 4 weeks after the third dose. A 
commercially available kit which measures binding antibodies was used, in contrast to the methods 
used in clinical trials performed by the MAH which measure neutralising antibodies. Results are 
therefore not directly comparable to the already available serology results from healthy subjects. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that sero-response was conventionally defined, as there is no immune 
correlate of protection established for healthy subjects or for patients with various 
immunocompromised conditions. 
The data indicate that an additional dose given to immunocompromised subjects increases the 
frequency of sero-responders from 40% prior to dose three, to 68% one month after the third dose. 
The clinical relevance of the increased frequency is unknown as no efficacy data are available. 
However, given the medical need for protection against COVID-19 in these vulnerable patients, it is a 
reasonable assumption that a third dose given to this group may increase protection against COVID-
19, at least in some patients. 
Based on previous experience of vaccination of adolescents the results can be extrapolated to subjects 
down to 12 years of age with similar immunosuppression. Immune responses are not expected to be 
lower in adolescents compared to adults.  
The safety information provided is very limited. The only available information is that no SAE occurred 
within an unspecified period after a third dose was given to 101 solid organ transplant recipients, and 
that no acute rejections occurred. 
The practice of Kamar et al 2021 is considered illustrative of what may be considered reasonable 
clinical management. 
Overall, a third dose could be justified based on individual benefit-risk considerations and it may be 
given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. The time interval between the second and 
the third dose should be at least 28 days. Inclusion of the data in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. is not 
supported, due to the limited nature of this data. 
More information on the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in immunocompromised subjects 
(including assessment of antibody responses and cell-mediated responses) will be collected in the 
remit of the studies BNT162-01 Cohort 13, ACCESS/VAC4EU, C4591011, C4591012 and C4591018 as 
detailed in the currently approved RMP. 
The benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty remains positive.

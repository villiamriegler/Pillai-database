CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kyntheum is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Kyntheum is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 210 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, and 2 
followed by 210 mg every 2 weeks. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response 
after 12-16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve 
with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. 
Elderly (aged 65 years and over) 
No dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Kyntheum has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kyntheum in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not 
yet been established. No data are available.

Method of administration 
Kyntheum is administered by subcutaneous injection. Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only. 
Kyntheum should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or 
affected by psoriasis. The pre-filled syringe must not be shaken. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Kyntheum when 
deemed appropriate by a physician. Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of 
Kyntheum according to the instructions provided in the package leaflet. Detailed instructions for use 
are included at the end of the package leaflet.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active Crohn’s disease. 
Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)  
Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with IL-17 
inhibitors. Therefore, brodalumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
(see section 4.8). If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, or 
experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, treatment should be 
discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated. 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour, including completed suicide, have been reported in patients treated 
with brodalumab. The majority of patients with suicidal behaviour had a history of depression and/or 
suicidal ideation or behaviour. A causal association between treatment with brodalumab and increased 
risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour has not been established.  
The risk and benefit of treatment with brodalumab should be carefully weighed for patients with a 
history of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour, or for patients who develop such 
symptoms. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the 
emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they 
should contact their healthcare provider if such events occur. If a patient suffers from new or 
worsening symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour is identified, it is 
recommended to discontinue treatment. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been reported in the post-marketing setting. In the event of 
an anaphylactic reaction, or any other serious allergic reaction, administration of brodalumab should 
be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.

Infections 
Brodalumab may increase the risk of infections.  
During the 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial period in patients with psoriasis, serious infections 
were observed in 0.5% of patients receiving brodalumab (see section 4.8).  
Caution should be exercised when considering the use of brodalumab in patients with a chronic 
infection or a history of recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if 
signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the 
patient should be closely monitored and brodalumab should not be administered until the infection 
resolves. 
Brodalumab should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should 
be considered prior to initiation of treatment in patients with latent tuberculosis.  
Vaccinations 
It is recommended that patients be brought up-to-date with all immunisations in accordance with local 
immunisation guidelines prior to initiation of treatment. Live vaccines should not be given 
concurrently with brodalumab (see section 4.5). No data are available on the response to live vaccines 
or the risk of infection, or transmission of infection after the administration of live vaccines in patients 
receiving brodalumab. 
Vaccination of infants 
Vaccination of infants with live vaccines following third trimester exposure to brodalumab should be 
discussed with a physician (see also section 4.6). 
Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 
The safety and efficacy of brodalumab in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, 
or phototherapy have not been evaluated. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with brodalumab (see section 4.4). 
The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1, 
IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Although a role for interleukin (IL)-17A and 
IL-17RA in the regulation of CYP450 enzymes has not been reported, the effect of brodalumab on 
CYP3A4/3A5 activity was evaluated in a disease-drug-drug interaction study.  
In patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, a single subcutaneous dose of 210 mg 
brodalumab increased the exposure of midazolam, a CYP3A4/3A5 substrate by 24%. Based on the 
magnitude of change in exposure of midazolam, no dose adjustment of CYP3A4/3A5 substrates is 
necessary when administered concomitantly with brodalumab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and 
for at least 12 weeks after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of brodalumab in pregnant women. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
Human IgG2 is known to cross the placental barrier and brodalumab is a human IgG2, therefore, 
brodalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Kyntheum in pregnancy.  
As the metabolism of brodalumab is unknown in infants, benefit risk for exposure of the infant to live 
vaccines following third trimester exposure to Kyntheum should be discussed with a physician. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether brodalumab is excreted in human milk. Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody 
and is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
Kyntheum therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No data are available on the effect of brodalumab on human fertility. Animal studies did not show any 
effects on male and female reproductive organs and on sperm count, motility and morphology (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kyntheum has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are arthralgia (4.6%), headache (4.3%), fatigue 
(2.6%), diarrhoea (2.2%), and oropharyngeal pain (2.1%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA 
system organ class (SOC). Within each SOC, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the 
most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse 
reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each 
frequency grouping adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Inflammatory bowel disease 
Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and 
ulcerative colitis) have been reported with IL-17 inhibitors (see section 4.4). 
Infections 
During the 12-week placebo-controlled trial period in plaque psoriasis, infections were reported in 
28.2% of patients treated with brodalumab compared with 23.4% of patients treated with placebo. The 
majority of infections consisted of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, 
urinary tract infections, bronchitis, influenza and sinusitis, which did not necessitate treatment 
discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with brodalumab and in 0.1% 
of patients treated with placebo. Higher rates of fungal infections, primarily non-serious skin and 
mucosal candida infections, were observed in brodalumab patients compared to placebo patients, 2.5% 
vs 1.0%, respectively.  
Through week 52, the event rates per 100 patient-years for infections were 134.7 for patients treated 
with brodalumab and 124.1 for patients treated with ustekinumab. The event rates per 100 patient-
years for serious infections were 2.4 for patients treated with brodalumab and 1.2 for patients treated 
with ustekinumab. One serious case of cryptococcal meningitis and one serious case of coccidioidies 
infection were observed in clinical trials (see section 4.4). 
Neutropenia 
During the 12-week placebo-controlled period of clinical trials, neutropenia was reported in 0.9% of 
patients treated with brodalumab compared with 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Most of the 
brodalumab-associated neutropenias were mild, transient and reversible. 
Neutropenia Grade 3 (<1.0 × 109/L to 0.5 × 109/L) was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving 
brodalumab compared to none of the patients who received ustekinumab or placebo. No Neutropenia 
Grade 4 (<0.5 × 109/L) was reported in patients who received either brodalumab or placebo, but in 
0.2% of patients who received ustekinumab. No serious infections were associated with neutropenia.

Immunogenicity 
Antibodies to brodalumab developed in 2.2% (88/3935) of patients treated with brodalumab for up to 
52 weeks in psoriasis clinical trials (0.3% of the patients had anti-brodalumab antibodies at baseline). 
Of these patients, none had neutralising antibodies. 
No evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety profile was associated with 
anti-brodalumab antibody development. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 700 mg intravenously have been administered in clinical trials with no evidence of dose 
limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any 
signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted 
immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC12 
Mechanism of action 
Brodalumab is a recombinant fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG2 antibody that binds with 
high affinity to human IL-17RA and blocks the biological activities of the pro-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F heterodimer, IL-17C and IL-17E (also known as IL-25), resulting in 
inhibition of the inflammation and clinical symptoms associated with psoriasis. IL-17RA is a protein 
expressed on the cell surface and is a required component of receptor complexes utilised by multiple 
IL-17 family cytokines. IL-17 family cytokine levels have been reported to be increased in psoriasis. 
IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A/F heterodimer have pleiotropic activities including the induction of pro-
inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, GROα, and G-CSF from epithelial cells, endothelial cells and 
fibroblasts that promote tissue inflammation. IL-17C has been shown to induce similar responses as 
IL-17A and IL-17F in keratinocytes. Blocking IL-17RA inhibits IL-17 cytokine-induced responses 
resulting in normalisation of inflammation in the skin. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Elevated levels of IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-17F gene expression are found in psoriatic plaques. 
Elevated levels of expression of IL-12B and IL-23A, the genes for the two subunits of IL-23, an 
upstream activator of IL-17A and IL-17F expression, are also found in psoriatic plaques. Treatment 
with brodalumab in psoriasis patients has been shown to decrease levels of IL-17A and markers of cell 
proliferation and epidermal thickness in lesional skin biopsies to non-lesional skin biopsy levels up to 
12 weeks post-treatment. 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
The efficacy and safety of brodalumab was assessed in 4373 adult plaque psoriasis patients across 
three multinational, randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trials (AMAGINE-
1, AMAGINE-2, and AMAGINE-3). AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3 were also active comparator 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ustekinumab)-controlled. All three trials included a 12-week placebo-controlled induction phase, a 
double-blind duration of 52 weeks, and an open-label long-term extension. 
Patients enrolled were candidates for systemic therapy, including phototherapy, biologic and non-
biologic systemic therapies. Approximately 21% of patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis. 
Approximately 30% of patients had previously received a biological and 13% of patients were 
biological failures. 
Patients were predominantly men (70%) and white (91%), with a mean age of 45 years (18 to 86 
years), of these 6.4% were ≥65 years of age and 0.3% were >75 years of age. Across treatment 
groups, the baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ranged from 9.4 to 72 (median: 17.4) 
and baseline involved body surface area (BSA) ranged from 10 to 97 (median: 21). Baseline static 
Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score ranged from “3 (moderate)” (58%) to “5 (very severe)” 
(5%). 
AMAGINE-1 was conducted in 661 patients. The trial included a 12-week double-blind, placebo-
controlled induction phase followed by a double-blind withdrawal and retreatment phase up to 52 
weeks. Patients randomised to brodalumab received 210 mg or 140 mg at Week 0 (day 1), Week 1, 
and Week 2 followed by same dose every 2 weeks. At Week 12, patients originally randomised to 
brodalumab who achieved sPGA success (0 or 1) were re-randomised to receive either placebo or 
continued brodalumab at their induction dose. Patients originally randomised to placebo and those who 
did not meet the criteria for re-randomisation received brodalumab 210 mg every two weeks beginning 
at Week 12. Retreatment was available at or after Week 16 for patients with return of disease and 
rescue treatment was available after 12 weeks of retreatment.  
AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3 were identical placebo- and ustekinumab-controlled trials conducted 
in 1831 and 1881 patients, respectively. Both trials included a 12-week double-blind, placebo- and 
ustekinumab-controlled induction phase followed by a double-blind maintenance phase up to 52 
weeks. Patients randomised to brodalumab in the induction phase received 210 mg or 140 mg at Week 
0 (day 1), Week 1, and Week 2 followed by same dose every 2 weeks. Patients randomised to 
ustekinumab received 45 mg for patients ≤100 kg and 90 mg for patients >100 kg at Weeks 0, 4, and 
16 followed by same dose every 12 weeks. At Week 12, patients originally randomised to brodalumab 
were re-randomised to receive either 210 mg every 2 weeks, or 140 mg every 2 weeks, or 140 mg 
every 4 weeks, or 140 mg every 8 weeks during the maintenance phase. Patients originally randomised 
to placebo received brodalumab 210 mg every 2 weeks beginning at Week 12. At Week 12, patients in 
the ustekinumab group continued to receive ustekinumab and then were switched to brodalumab 
210 mg every 2 weeks at Week 52. Rescue treatment was available at or after Week 16 for patients 
with an inadequate response single sPGA ≥3 or persistent sPGA of 2 over at least a 4-week period.

In all three clinical trials, examination of age, gender, race, use of prior systemic or photo therapy, use 
of prior biologics, and biologic failures did not identify differences in response in all key endpoints 
[PASI 75, PASI 100, sPGA success (0 or 1), and sPGA clear (0)] to brodalumab among these 
subgroups. 
Along with primary efficacy endpoints, clinically important improvements were observed in Psoriasis 
Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) at Week 12 (AMAGINE-1) and in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) 
at Week 12 and 52 (AMAGINE-1,-2, and -3). 
Quality of life/patient reported outcomes 
The proportion of patients who achieved a Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) score of 0 (not at all) or 
1 (mild) on every item (itch, burning, stinging, pain, redness, scaling, cracking and flaking) at Week 
12 are shown in Table 2. 
The percentage of patients that at Week 12 achieved a DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) score 
of 0 or 1 was 56%, 61%, 59% in the brodalumab 210 mg group and 5%, 5%, 7% in the placebo group 
in AMAGINE-1, -2 and -3, respectively (adjusted p-value <0.001) and 44% in the ustekinumab groups 
(AMAGINE-2 and -3).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
brodalumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in plaque psoriasis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling, the estimated accumulation ratio after 20 weeks of 
dosing is 2.5-fold. In moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients following a single subcutaneous 
administration of brodalumab at 210 mg, the mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was 
13.4 mcg/ml (standard deviation [SD] = 7.29 mcg/ml). The median time to maximum concentration 
(Tmax) was 3.0 days (range: 2.0 to 4.0 days) and the mean area under the concentration time curve to 
the last measurable concentration (AUClast) was 111 mcg*day/ml (SD = 64.4 mcg*day/ml). The 
subcutaneous bioavailability of brodalumab estimated by population pharmacokinetic modelling was 
55%. 
The observed pharmacokinetic parameters during steady-state (weeks 10-12) were:  mean steady-state 
area under the concentration time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) was 227.4 mcg*day/ml (SD 
= 191.7 mcg*day/ml) corresponding to average concentration (Cav,ss) of 16.2 mcg/ml, mean Cmax was 
20.9 mcg/ml (SD = 17.0 mcg/ml) and Week 12 mean minimum serum concentration (Ctrough) was 
9.8 mcg/ml (SD = 11.2 mcg/ml). 
Distribution 
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling, the estimated mean steady-state volume of 
distribution of brodalumab was approximately 7.24 L.  
Biotransformation 
As an IgG2 human monoclonal antibody brodalumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides 
and amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG. 
Elimination 
Following subcutaneous administrations of 210 mg, brodalumab exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics 
typical for a monoclonal antibody that undergoes target-mediated drug disposition. 
Brodalumab clearance decreases with increasing dose and exposure increases in a greater than dose-
proportional manner. For a 3-fold increase in SC brodalumab dose from 70 to 210 mg, the steady-state 
serum brodalumab Cmax and AUC0-t increased approximately 18- and 25-fold, respectively. 
Following a single subcutaneous administration of brodalumab 210 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, the 
apparent clearance (CL/F) is 2.95 L/day.  
Population pharmacokinetic modelling predicted that serum brodalumab concentrations dropped below 
the quantification limit (0.05 mcg/ml) 63 days after discontinuation of steady-state dosing of 
brodalumab 210 mg administered every 2 weeks in 95% of the patients. However, brodalumab 
concentrations below LLOQ (Lower Limit of Quantification) were associated with IL-17 receptor 
occupancy up to 81%. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling the estimated half-life of brodalumab was 10.9 days 
at steady-state after every other week subcutaneous dose of 210 mg. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impact of weight on pharmacokinetics 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that exposure decreased as body weight increased. 
No dose adjustment is recommended. 
Elderly patients 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that age did not have an effect on brodalumab 
pharmacokinetics, which was co-based on 259 (6%) patients being 65-74 years old and on 14 (0.3%) 
patients being ≥75 years old, within a total PK population of 4271 plaque psoriasis patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Renal 
elimination of intact brodalumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor 
consequence. Brodalumab is expected to be mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment 
is not expected to influence clearance. 
Other populations 
The pharmacokinetics of brodalumab was similar between Japanese and non-Japanese patients with 
psoriasis. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that gender did not have an effect on brodalumab 
pharmacokinetics. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, developed using all available data indicated 
that at a dose of 210 mg every 2 weeks, 90% of all patients would be predicted to maintain a trough 
concentration greater than the estimated IC90 value of 1.51 mcg/ml. Based on an exploratory 
descriptive analysis, no relationship was observed between exposure and incidence of serious 
infections and infestations, candida infections, viral infections, and suicidal ideation and behaviour 
events. Exposure-response analysis indicates that higher brodalumab concentrations are related to 
better PASI and sPGA response. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints and assessment of fertility-related endpoints), and 
toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Carcinogenicity studies with brodalumab have not been conducted. However, there were no 
proliferative changes in cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly subcutaneous doses of brodalumab 
at 90 mg/kg for 6 months (AUC exposure 47-fold higher than in human patients receiving brodalumab 
210 mg every 2 weeks). The mutagenic potential of brodalumab was not evaluated; however, 
monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
In cynomolgus monkeys there were no effects on male and female reproductive organs and on sperm 
count, motility and morphology following administration of brodalumab at dose levels up to 90 mg/kg 
once weekly for 6 months, (AUC exposure up to 47-fold higher than in human patients receiving 
brodalumab 210 mg every 2 weeks). 
In cynomolgus monkeys, no effects on embryo-foetal or postnatal (up to 6 months of age) 
development were observed when brodalumab was dosed subcutaneously throughout pregnancy at 
exposure levels up to 27-fold higher than those achieved in human patients receiving brodalumab 
210 mg every 2 weeks based on the area under the concentration curve (AUC). Serum concentrations 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in monkey infants and in foetal rabbits indicated considerable passage of brodalumab from the mother 
to the foetus at the end of pregnancy.  
In cynomolgus monkeys, after weekly subcutaneous dosing of brodalumab at dose levels up to 
90 mg/kg for 6 months, brodalumab-related effects were limited to injection site reactions and 
mucocutaneous inflammation that was consistent with pharmacologic modulation of host surveillance 
to commensal microflora. There were no effects on peripheral blood immunophenotyping and the T-
cell dependent antibody response assay. In a local tolerance test in rabbits, moderate to severe edema 
was observed after subcutaneous injection of a formulation containing brodalumab at the clinical 
concentration of 140 mg/ml.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kyntheum is and what it is used for 
Kyntheum contains the active substance brodalumab. Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody, a 
specialised type of protein that recognises and attaches to certain proteins in the body. 
Brodalumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works 
by blocking the activity of IL-17 proteins, which are present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis. 
Kyntheum is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation and 
scaly plaque formation on the skin. Kyntheum is used in adults with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis affecting large areas of the body. 
Using Kyntheum will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and reducing psoriasis 
signs and symptoms, such as itch, redness, scaling, burning, stinging, cracking, flaking and pain. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Kyntheum 
Do not use Kyntheum 
• 
if you are allergic to brodalumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Kyntheum 
if you have active Crohn’s disease 
if you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important (for example, active 
tuberculosis). 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Kyntheum: 
• 
• 
• 
if you have an inflammatory disease affecting the gut named Crohn’s disease 
if you have an inflammation of the large intestine named ulcerative colitis 
if you have ever had or are having suicidal thoughts or actions, depression, anxiety, or mood 
problems 
if you have an infection now or often get infections 
• 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have a long-term (chronic) infection  
if you have tuberculosis (TB), have had a positive TB test, or have been in close contact with 
someone with TB. You may be treated with another medicine for TB before you begin treatment 
with Kyntheum 
if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccination. You should not be given 
certain types of vaccines (called ‘live vaccines’) while being treated with Kyntheum 
if you have used Kyntheum during the last three months of your pregnancy, you should talk to 
your doctor before vaccinating your baby 
if you are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis, such as another immunosuppressant or 
phototherapy with ultraviolet (UV) light. 
After starting Kyntheum, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have been told by your doctor that you have developed Crohn’s disease 
if you feel depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of suicide, or have unusual mood changes 
if you have an infection or have any signs of infection listed in Section 4 “Possible side effects” 
if you have been told you have tuberculosis. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) 
Stop using Kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice abdominal 
cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (any signs of bowel problems). 
Look out for allergic reactions 
Kyntheum can potentially cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions. You must look out 
for signs of these conditions while you are taking Kyntheum. 
Stop using Kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
indicating an allergic reaction. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
Children and adolescents 
Kyntheum is not recommended for children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Kyntheum 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
• 
• 
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
if you have recently had or you or your baby are going to have a vaccination, see "Warnings and 
precautions" in section 2 "What you need to know before using Kyntheum". 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Kyntheum has not been tested in 
pregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your unborn baby. It is therefore 
preferable to avoid the use of Kyntheum during pregnancy. If you are a woman of childbearing 
potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use adequate contraception while 
using Kyntheum and for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of Kyntheum. 
It is not known whether brodalumab passes into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding 
or plan to breast-feed. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or stop 
using Kyntheum. Together you will consider the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit 
of Kyntheum to you. 
Driving and using machines 
Kyntheum is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
3. 
How to use Kyntheum 
Kyntheum should be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in diagnosing and treating 
psoriasis.  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  
How much Kyntheum is given 
• 
• 
• 
Your doctor will decide how much Kyntheum you need and for how long. The recommended 
dose is 210 mg (one injection). 
After the first dose you will need to have a weekly injection at Week 1 (one week after the first 
dose) and Week 2 (two weeks after the first dose). After that, you will need to have an injection 
every two weeks. 
Kyntheum is for long-term treatment. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to 
check that the treatment is having the desired effect. Tell your doctor if you think your signs and 
symptoms of psoriasis are not improving after using Kyntheum. 
How is Kyntheum given 
Kyntheum is given as an injection under the skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Self-administration instructions 
See the detailed “Instructions for Use” that comes with this medicine for information on the right 
way to store, prepare, and give your injections at home. 
• 
If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can give the injections at home, you or your 
caregiver should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Kyntheum. Do not try to 
inject Kyntheum until you or your caregiver have been shown how to inject Kyntheum by your 
doctor or nurse.  
Do not shake the pre-filled syringe before use. 
Kyntheum is injected in your upper legs (thighs) or stomach area (abdomen) by you or a 
caregiver. A caregiver may also give you an injection in your upper, outer arm. 
Do not inject into an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red, hard or in an area of skin that is 
affected by psoriasis. 
• 
• 
• 
If you use more Kyntheum than you should 
If you use more of this medicine than prescribed or take the dose sooner than required, tell your 
doctor.  
If you forget to use Kyntheum 
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Kyntheum, inject the next dose as soon as you can after the 
missed dose. Then, talk to your doctor about when you should inject the next dose. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Kyntheum 
You should not stop using Kyntheum without speaking to your doctor first. If you stop treatment, 
symptoms of psoriasis may come back.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

(abdomen) 
Thigh

• 
•

your stomach area (abdomen), except for a 5-centimetre area right around your belly button 
(navel). 
Only your caregiver can use: 
• 
your outer area of upper arm. 
About the injection area: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised red, or hard.  
Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. 
Avoid injecting directly into raised, thick, red or scaly skin patches or lesions. 
Clean the area where you plan to inject with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. 
Do not touch this area again before injecting. 
If you want to use the same injection area each time, make sure it is not exactly the same spot 
that you used for a previous injection. 
Step 2: Getting ready to inject 
E.  When you are ready to inject, pull the needle cap straight out and away from your body 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Throw the needle cap into the sharps disposal container provided. 
• 
• 
Do not twist or bend the needle cap. 
Do not put the needle cap back onto the syringe. 
You may notice a small air bubble in the syringe or a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. Both are 
normal and do not need to be removed.

Pinch the skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, creating an area about 5 centimetres wide. 
Important: Keep the skin pinched until after you have injected.

somewhere between 45 and 90 degrees 
Do not place your finger on the plunger while inserting the needle. 
H.  Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger all the way down until it stops moving 
I.  When you have finished, release your thumb. Then, gently remove the syringe from your skin 
38 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important: When you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, 
this means you have not received a full dose. Call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. 
Step 4: Finishing up 
J.  Throw away the used syringe  
• 
• 
• 
Put your used pre-filled syringe in a puncture resistant sharps disposal container straight after 
use. 
Do not re-use the syringe. 
Do not recycle the syringe or sharps disposal container or throw them into household rubbish. 
Important: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the sight and the reach of children. 
K.  Check the injection site  
If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site.  
Cover with plaster if needed.

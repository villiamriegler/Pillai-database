During the meeting on 21 April 1998 the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of questions to 
be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the  company  on

A  GMP  inspection  of  the  manufacturing  site  for  the  active  ingredient  at  Framingham  was 
conducted  on  26-29  May  1998.  Contract  laboratories  for  testing  of  the  bioreactor  harvest

The  Company  submitted  the  responses  to  the  consolidated  list  of  questions  on  17  July  1998, 
and, as these were considered incomplete, submitted a full package of responses on 16 October 
1998. 
The joint assessment report on the company’s responses to the list of questions was circulated to 
all CPMP Members on 20 November 1998.

A discussion on the additional information was held at the BWP on 17 February 1999.

BWP  by  adopting  a  list  of  outstanding  points  and  proposed  on-going  pharmaceutical 
commitments to be addressed by the Company. The CPMP agreed to an exceptional clock-stop

The CPMP, during its  meeting on 27-30 July 1999, discussed the recommendations presented 
by  the  Rapporteurs,  considering  the  responses  provided  by  the  Company  were  satisfactory. 
Amendments  were  discussed  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet 
texts. 
During the meeting on 27-30 July 1999 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and 
the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a 
Marketing Authorisation to Thyrogen. 
The  CPMP  wrote  to  the  European  Commission  on  23  September  1999,  informing  the 
Commission  that  by  end  of  August  1999  the  Applicant  had  not  fullfilled  its  commitment  to 
submit  important  information  relating  to  the  quality  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  CPMP 
emphasised  that  the  requested  information  needed  to  be  reviewed  before  a  Marketing 
Authorisation could be granted. 
In  a  letter  dated  26  October  1999,  the  Commission  informed  the  EMEA  that  the  decision 
making  process  had  been  suspended  and  requested  the  CPMP  to  evaluate  whether  there  were 
new questions of a scientific or technical nature,which had to be addressed in the Opinion of the 
Agency.  In  the  meantime,  the  Applicant  submitted  the  missing  scientific  data  on  18  October 
1999. 
The CPMP during its meeting of 14-16 December 1999 assessed the additional information and 
issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to Thyrogen. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 9 March 2000..

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven haemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because 
inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, 
non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. Rarely, 
life-threatening bleeding may also occur. Patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the 
extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient FVIII that is used to classify the disease severity (WFH, 
2012): 
• 
• 
• 
<1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The overall reported number of haemophilia A patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the World 
Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and 
identified 140,313 people with haemophilia A (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). There are currently 
approximately 30,000 patients in the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
10,000. 
Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family 
history and a carrier mother. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; their 
disease is presumably caused by new mutations. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand 
factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds 
to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated 
factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts 
prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Haemophilia A manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can lead to 
chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (Bolton-Maggs and Pasi, 2003). The majority of bleeding 
occurs internally into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. Serious 
bleeds also occur in muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and forearm, 
and in the mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. Less frequently, life 
threatening bleeds can occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the gastrointestinal system or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 8/144 
 
 
 
enclosed areas like the intracranial or intracerebral spaces. The approximate frequencies of bleeds at the 
different sites are: 70 to 80% in joints (haemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in muscle, 5 to 10% in the central 
nervous system, and < 5% for bleeds at all other sites (Srivastava et al., 2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of clotting 
factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of comprehensive 
haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home 
treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with 
haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
The recent development of FVIII products with extended half-lives has made it possible to maintain 
higher FVIII activity levels with fewer injections. Two extended half-life FVIII products are currently 
licensed (Elocta and Adynovi). 
About the product 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is a recombinant human factor VIII product, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
cells (CHO), with a glycoPEGylation on the O-linked glycan in the truncated B-domain. The turoctocog alfa 
pegol molecule is a polypeptide containing a Heavy chain and a Light chain held together by non-covalent 
interactions. In native Factor VIII these chains are connected by a native B-domain, while turoctocog alfa 
pegol has a truncated rFVIII containing 21 amino acids of the native B-domain. When turoctocog alfa 
pegol is activated by thrombin, the B-domain containing the 40K PEG and the a3-region are cleaved off, 
thus generating activated factor VIII (rFVIIIa) which is similar in structure to native FVIIIa. 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is based on the currently licenced NovoEight (turoctocog alfa) with an extended 
half-life due to the covalent conjugation of a PEG moiety.  
The mechanism of action is based on replacement of the deficient or absent FVIII in patients with 
haemophilia A. 
The applicant claimed indication: 
“Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
Esperoct can be used for all age groups.” 
The CHMP agreed with the following indication: 
“Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency).” 
Posology: 
The dose, dosing interval and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor 
VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding, on the targeted factor VIII activity level and 
the patient’s clinical condition.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 9/144 
 
 
 
The posology for On Demand Treatment is proposed as follows: 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl.  
The required dose is determined using the following formula: Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x 
desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
Guidance for the dosing of Esperoct for the on demand treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes is 
provided in table 1. Maintain plasma factor VIII activity level at or above the described plasma levels (in 
IU per dL or % of normal). For treatment of bleeds a maximum single dose of Esperoct at 75 IU/kg and 
a maximum total dose of 200 IU/kg/24 hours may be administered.

Perioperative management 
The dose level and dosing intervals for surgery depend on the procedure and local practice. A maximum 
single dose of Esperoct at 75 IU/kg and a maximum total dose of 200 IU/kg/24 hours may be 
administered. 
The frequency of doses and duration of therapy should always be individually adjusted based on individual 
clinical response. 
Prophylaxis 
Adults and adolescents (12 years and above) 
Assessment report

The recommended starting dose is 50 IU of Esperoct per kg body weight every 4 days. 
The maximum single dose is 75 IU/kg. 
Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved factor VIII 
levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Children (below 12 years) 
The long-term safety of Esperoct in children below 12 years has not been established. 
Method of administration: 
Esperoct should be administered by intravenous injection (over approximately 2 minutes) after 
reconstitution of the lyophilised powder with 4 mL supplied solvent (sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Turoctocog alfa pegol finished product (FP) is presented as a lyophilised powder to be reconstituted with 
the supplied solvent (sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection) before administration. The 
finished product is presented in a 5 mL type I glass vial in five different strengths: 500 IU/vial, 1000 
IU/vial, 1500 IU/vial, 2000 IU/vial and 3000 IU/vial. The formulation contains well-known pharmaceutical 
excipients of compendial quality (histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 80, methionine, calcium chloride 
dihydrate, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water for injections).  
Turoctocog alfa pegol is based on the currently authorised NovoEight (turoctocog alfa) with an extended 
half-life due to the covalent conjugation of a PEG moiety. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is a recombinant human factor VIII (FVIII) product, produced in Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cells, with a specific glycoPEGylation on the O-linked glycan (primarily on Ser750 in the 21 
amino acid B-domain). The turoctocog alfa pegol molecule consists of a heavy chain of 87 kDa (excluding 
post-translational modifications and PEG moiety) and a light chain of 79 kDa (excluding post-translational 
modifications) held together by noncovalent interactions. 
Post-translational modifications of turoctocog alfa intermediate include disulphide bridges, tyrosine 
sulphations and glycosylations. 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is produced by glycoPEGylation of turoctocog alfa intermediate (truncated 
recombinant human FVIII containing 21 amino acids of the native B-domain). The size of the polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) attached to the O-linked glycan is 40kDa.

                disulphide bridges and PEG moiety indicated. 
When turoctocog alfa pegol is activated by thrombin, the B-domain containing the PEG moiety and the 
a3-region are cleaved off, thus generating activated rFVIII (rFVIIIa) which is similar in structure to native 
FVIIIa.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacture of the active substance (AS) 
The commercial manufacturing process for turoctocog alfa pegol active substance (N8-GP AS) is divided 
into four sections: cell cultivation, capture, purification, and PEGylation.  
Control of materials 
Turoctocog alfa is expressed in CHO cell line. The cells are propagated from one vial of the working cell 
bank in shake flasks and bioreactors. The production process is carried out as a continuous cultivation 
process. 
Full information has been provided on the qualitative composition of cell culture media. 
Subsequently turoctocog alfa is captured and subjected to purification, virus inactivation and virus 
filtration, followed by the pegylation step and further purification. 
Critical steps are defined, and the process parameters are sufficiently justified.  
The AS is then stored in suitable containers.

Three process intermediates are defined for the N8-GP manufacturing process: 
  Z1 intermediate (i.e. eluate from the Z1 capture step) 
  Turoctocog alfa intermediate 
  40K PSC intermediate (i.e. activated PEG) 
Manufacture of activated PEG (40K PSC) 
The manufacturing process for 40K PSC intermediate consists of several validated steps.  
Shipping of the 40K PSC intermediate is confirmed to be a validated process. 
Process validation 
Process validation of the active substance is based on the following: 
•  Process evaluation 
During process evaluation justification for in-process controls and the impact on the quality attributes 
were assessed. 
The process parameters have been evaluated by risk assessment for quality impact on turoctocog alfa 
pegol. In addition the parameters have been evaluated for scalability. The risk assessment (FMECA) 
was based on laboratory and production scale experience. Based on the risk assessment, a number of 
process parameters were selected for further investigation. All the selected scalable process 
parameters were included in laboratory scale process justification experiments. 
The purpose of the process justification was to challenge each unit operation and justify limits for the 
process parameters. The process justification has been based on both single factor experiments and 
factorial design experiments performed at laboratory scale. 
•  Process performance qualification (PPQ) 
The Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) of turoctocog alfa pegol for cell cultivation, capture, 
purification and pegylation was executed according to quality assurance (QA) approved protocol to 
demonstrate that these processes perform consistently and reproducibly. 
The cultivation process was performed within operational limits using QA approved batch records. 
The evaluation criteria for a successful PPQ were based on a combination of prerequisites and 
acceptance criteria. 
The prerequisites were defined as: 
o  Compliance with the limits for the process  
o  Compliance with the limits for the analytical tests  
o  QA approval of batch documentation for the PPQ batches 
o  The production should be run with process parameters according to the manufacturing instruction 
and PPQ protocol 
Acceptance criteria for the successful execution of the PPQ were established for those tests covering 
four different types of process performance requirements: 
o  Specific criteria related to the purpose of the individual process  
o  Product formation and recovery  
o  No contamination  
o  Product quality parameters  
All process parameters and in-process tests with limits are within limits/range for each batch.  
All PPQ batches met the specification limits.

In conclusion, the manufacturing process has been qualified to consistently and reproducibly produce 
turoctocog alfa intermediate of the specified quality.   
•  Continued process verification (CPV) 
The continued process verification (CPV) will ensure that the manufacturing process remains in the 
validated state during commercial production.  
With regard to impurities the purification steps of the turoctocog alfa pegol process were demonstrated to 
reduce impurities to a very low level or even eliminate below their quantification limits (LoQ). For 
impurities which are not completely removed the acceptable daily exposure was calculated, and they are 
included in the AS specification or controlled at the intermediate level. 
Impurities from the 40K PSC manufacturing process are removed/eliminated by different process steps. 
Manufacturing process development 
Turoctocog alfa pegol active substance for non-clinical and clinical trials has been manufactured on a 
campaign basis.  
Manufacturing process development included transfer from laboratory facility for non-clinical material to 
GMP facilities for clinical and commercial production, optimisation of cell cultivation and purification 
processes and a change in supplier of 40K PSC. 
Overall comparability between the different development stages of the manufacturing processes has been 
demonstrated. It was furthermore shown that biological activity was not impacted. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The turoctocog alfa pegol active substance control strategy has been developed in accordance with the 
ICH Q11 guideline using a traditional approach. The basis for the control strategy is formed by the critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) and the parameters having an impact on the CQAs. A CQA is defined as a 
physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be controlled within 
an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the product quality. The identification of the CQAs is 
based on thorough characterisation of turoctocog alfa pegol, prior experience and process understanding 
and general scientific knowledge. 
Risk assessments have been performed to identify the steps in the manufacturing process with a potential 
impact on the CQAs, to eliminate unacceptable risks and to define mitigating actions if moderate risks are 
identified. In-process controls (process parameters and in-process tests) needed for adequate control of 
the production process have been identified. 
The control strategy ensures process performance and product quality and includes the following 
elements: 
  Process design – selection of steps to ensure the desired product quality based on the critical quality 
attributes 
In-process controls (process parameters and in-process tests) 
  Raw materials – selection and control 
 
  Specification testing of active substance 
  Continued process verification and maintenance of the validated state 
  Facility and equipment – design and procedure control 
The manufacture of the PEG intermediate (40K PSC) is as well controlled by process parameters within 
defined ranges and IPCs. A specification document for the activated PEG intermediate has been provided.

Raw materials used in the manufacture of N8-GP and activated PEG are obtained from qualified suppliers 
and activated PEG is confirmed to be manufactured under GMP conditions. Incoming raw materials are 
visually inspected, sampled (filters/membranes exempted), analysed and released by QA according to 
specification. 
No raw materials of animal or human origin are used in the turoctocog alfa pegol process, neither in the 
manufacture of activated PEG. 
Control of materials 
The cell substrate and expression construct are adequately described, characterised and tested according 
to ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D. Source, origin and history of the parental CHO cell line have been sufficiently 
described. In line with ICH Q5B a detailed description of the construction and the genetic elements of the 
expression vector with the turoctocog alfa expression cassette has been provided; the entire sequence of 
the expression vector has been verified by sequencing. The generation of the cell substrate is presented 
in sufficient detail and included two rounds of cloning by limited dilution. 
A two-tiered cell bank system has been established; the same cell banks are used to manufacture the EU 
authorised product NovoEight (turoctocog alfa). The cell banking system has been adequately described 
with sufficient details on manufacture, storage, and history of the MCB and WCB. End-of-production cells 
(EPC) and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (CLA) were produced from the WCB using the commercial 
manufacturing process. The cell banks have been tested for identity, viability, growth characteristics and 
absence of adventitious agents, and genetically characterised according to the relevant ICH guidelines. 
Stability of the MCB and WCB banks is sufficiently monitored according to a defined programme. 
Genetic characterisation of the MCB, WCB, EOPC, and CLA by cDNA sequencing, determination of copy 
number by qPCR, integration pattern by Southern blot, and mRNA analyses by Northern blot sufficiently 
demonstrates that the cell substrate is genetically stable and support the set point of cultivation time in 
the production bioreactor and operational ranges for the seed train and in the production bioreactor. 
The protocol for manufacture of future MCBs has been provided. The respective manufacturing procedure 
is sufficiently defined and the proposed criteria for release, characterisation and stability testing are 
considered acceptable. Upon successful qualification and approval by the manufacturer QA, new WCBs 
can be used for manufacture of turoctocog alfa pegol. 
The expression vector and generation of the cell line are briefly described. Genetic characterisation of the 
raw material master cell bank and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age, determination of copy number and 
integration pattern demonstrates genetic stability of the cell line. 
Characterization 
Characterization of N8-GP has been performed on turoctocog alfa pegol (AS) and turoctocog alfa 
intermediate using material from the pivotal process as well from the commercial process. PEG obtained 
from both the previous supplier and the current supplier was used in the characterization studies. 
Characterization of impurities focused mainly on product-related impurities, at which a differentiation 
between product-related substances (being biologically active) and impurities (not being biologically 
active) was made.  
Physicochemical properties as well as primary and higher order structure were investigated and 
comparability between AS and the intermediate was shown, demonstrating that the pegylation of 
turoctocog alfa has no impact on molecular structure and physicochemical properties. The primary 
pegylation site is located at Ser750 in the heavy chain. Post-translational modifications were shown to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 15/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparable for the pegylated and unpegylated turoctocog alfa molecule. Differences in N- and O-terminal 
glycosylation could be attributed to the pegylation step. A slightly higher thermal stability was observed 
for the pegylated molecule. Posttranslational modifications were thoroughly discussed. 
Thrombin activation lead to three expected fragments demonstrating that the pegylated as well as the 
unpegylated molecule are completely activated and pegylation does not influence activation. 
Biological activity of N8-GP is determined by a chromogenic potency assay. Dose-dependent correlation 
with thrombin generation was shown for the chromogenic assay. FVIII potency assignment has been 
appropriately justified. The process related impurities are discussed in the validation section. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes test parameters on appearance, pH, identity, potency, protein 
content, purity, impurities and microbiological safety. The proposed list of parameters is considered 
comprehensive. 
Justification of specification 
The specification limits have been determined based on knowledge obtained during the pharmaceutical 
development work including production experience of clinical phase 3 batches. 
Impurities not included in the AS specification were shown to be reduced by the manufacturing process 
below their limit of quantification (LoQs) which can be accepted. 
Analytical procedures 
Non-compendial methods have been validated according to ICH Q2(R1) and respective validation reports 
are submitted. For the compendial methods bacterial endotoxin and microbial count verification reports of 
the compendial procedure have been provided. Method descriptions for all non-compendial test methods 
are submitted. 
Due to changes in the upstream manufacturing process which might have an impact on CHO HCP content, 
suitability of the already established HCP assay had to be demonstrated also for the commercial product. 
Similar HCP levels were shown for pivotal and commercial sample eluates from different manufacturing 
steps. 
Suitability of the HCP assay has been sufficiently demonstrated for the commercial process. 
Reference standards 
A turoctocog alfa pegol primary reference material (PRM) has been established for analytical use to serve 
as reference for determination of identity and as calibrator for assignment of turoctocog alfa pegol protein 
content and potency to turoctocog alfa pegol secondary reference material (SRM). 
The potency of turoctocog alfa pegol PRM was determined by calibration against the 8th WHO 
International Standard FVIII Concentrate (NIBSC code: 07/350) using Chromogenic assay. The Potency 
is expressed as IU/mL. 
Previously used in house reference standards are listed and were calibrated against the then valid WHO 
FVIII IS. 
It is confirmed that when a new in-house standard will be calibrated and assigned to the current WHO 
FVIII IS, additionally the current PRM will be included in the establishment study in order to evaluate 
potential consequences of change during implementation of a new PRM. 
Release specifications for future batches of reference materials have been included in the protocol. 
Batch analysis  
Batch analyses data from batches derived from all manufacturing development phases (including the 
commercial process and PPQ batches) have been provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 16/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The batch analyses data are all within their acceptance criteria and batches derived from different process 
development phases are comparable. These results support the comparability between early 
development, pivotal and commercial process and show that changes applied to the manufacturing 
process throughout development do not negatively impact product quality. 
Container closure 
The active substance is stored in suitable containers.Compatibility of the N8GP AS with the container 
materials has been investigated to evaluate if the container is suitable for storage of the turoctocog alfa 
pegol active substance, based on extraction data, leachables data and stability data.  
Based on the data provided, the proposed container closure system seems to be appropriate for AS 
storage/transport. 
Stability 
Stability of active substance 
Primary stability 
A primary stability study for turoctocog alfa pegol active substance is conducted to support the proposed 
shelf life at the recommended storage condition.  
All stability results including confidence intervals complied with the specification limits for all test 
parameters.  
PPQ stability 
The stability of several production scale batches of turoctocog alfa pegol active substance from process 
performance qualification (PPQ) of the manufacturing process is followed at long-term storage conditions 
in a container closure system comparable to the one used for storage and distribution of the active 
substance. 
All parameters currently available are within their acceptance criteria. 
Supportive stability 
The supportive stability studies have been conducted during the clinical development of turoctocog alfa 
pegol and comprise several production scale batches of turoctocog alfa pegol active substance, 
manufactured in pilot facilities.  
The results were within the specification limits applied. 
Based on real time stability data for the primary batches the proposed shelf life for the active substance 
is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The turoctocog alfa pegol finished product (FP) is a lyophilised powder and reconstituted in 4.3 mL 0.9% 
Sodium chloride solution before use. The FP is developed in five different product strengths containing 
500 IU/vial, 1000 IU/vial, 1500 IU/vial, 2000 IU/vial and 3000 IU/vial. The formulation contains 
well-known pharmaceutical excipients of compendial quality which are used in other approved 
commercial biopharmaceutical products for parenteral use. 
A histidine buffer system adjusted with sodium hydroxide/hydrochloric acid is used which results in a pH 
value of 6.9 upon reconstitution of FP. Sucrose is added as lyophilisation stabiliser, polysorbate 80 is used

A 5 mL type I glass vial (Ph. Eur. 3.2.1) with a type I latex-free chlorobutyl rubber stopper (Ph. Eur. 3.2.9) 
is used for primary packaging. Container closure integrity, compatibility and extractables/leachables have 
been assessed. A toxicological assessment concluded that the levels of leachables are below the threshold 
of toxicological concern. Dosage uniformity and usability have been verified for the syringe with solvent. 
The formulation development of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product has mainly been based on 
knowledge of stabilisation of lyophilised rFVIII as described in literature and knowledge of other Novo 
Nordisk recombinant coagulation factors (i.e. NovoEight). The choice of excipients have thus been based 
on this knowledge and long-term and accelerated stability studies have been carried out in order to verify 
the stability of the formulation. 
The majority of the development studies were performed with a bracketing approach covering the five 
strengths to be marketed. 
Purity, impurities, protein content and water content have been followed and shown to be consistent 
during development. During development the finished product manufacturing process has been 
optimised. The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.

The minor differences between the manufacturing processes relate to optimisation of the lyophilisation 
process, transfer of location for compounding, filling and lyophilisation from pilot manufacturing facility to 
commercial facility with consequent increase in batch size range and transfer of the lyophilisation process 
to a larger lyophiliser intended for commercial manufacture. 
The composition of the finished product has not changed during development and is identical to the 
composition intended to be marketed. 
Overall the presented data support the conclusion that finished product batches produced at the different 
development stages are comparable. 
Manufacture of the product and process control 
The finished product is manufactured at Novo Nordisk A/S in Gentofte, Denmark; labelling and secondary 
packaging of the finished finished product as well as attachment of scale to syringe for administration 
pre-filled with solvent is performed at a second site. The pre-filled syringes with solvent for reconstitution 
of the lyophilised product are produced at a contract manufacturer. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product consists of compounding, sterile filtration, filling, 
lyophilisation, and capping. 
Process controls and corresponding control limits have been established to ensure consistent quality of 
the product. Critical steps and controls were identified. Process times have been defined for the various 
process steps. 
The control strategy is designed based on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) and the variables having 
an impact on the CQAs. A CQA is defined as a physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or 
characteristic that should be controlled within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the 
desired product quality. The identification of the CQAs is based on manufacturing experience and process 
understanding from development and characterisation of turoctocog alfa pegol finished product, prior 
knowledge and general scientific knowledge. A severity rating is assigned for each CQA and appropriate 
description of severity ratings has been provided. The process validation programme followed a 
sequential approach comprising process design justification, process performance qualification and 
continued process verification. A bracketing approach was chosen.  
Data of full scale batches manufactured at the intended commercial facility were used to justify the 
process design and demonstrate that the established process is robust and reproducibly delivers product 
with acceptable quality. Robustness of the lyophilisation step was shown by challenging the process by 
setting parameters to their extremes and monitoring of shelf and product temperature as well as of 
product attributes. The lyophilisation process was challenged for maximum capacity of the lyophiliser 
intended for commercial production. 
The process performance qualification (PPQ) encompassed manufacture of several consecutive batches at 
the smallest batch size or largest batch size. 
In addition, proper positioning of the scale label to the syringe with solvent was verified and a sterile filter 
validation was carried out as part of the validation programme. 
Results presented show that the commercial manufacturing process reproducibly and consistently 
delivers FP of required quality.

Product specification 
A specification for the finished product is provided including test parameters on identity, water content, 
protein content, impurities, potency, purity and microbiological safety. The list of parameters is 
considered adequate and comprehensive.  
The specification limits have been established on the basis of knowledge obtained during pharmaceutical 
development as well as knowledge from production of clinical batches, process justification batches and 
the related stability studies. Manufacturing and analytical variability have been considered when 
specifying the limits of the individual parameters. Shelf life limits different from release specification limits 
were specified for parameters showing a statistical trend during shelf life. 
Analytical procedures 
Analytical procedures are divided into pharmacopoeial procedures and non-pharmacopoeial procedures. 
Some methods are identical to those used for the active substance. A few method changes have been 
implemented during development to improve the analytical programme. These changes are sufficiently 
described and reasonable. Method descriptions and method validation summaries have been provided. 
The non-compendial analytical methods have been appropriately validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) and 
the suitability of the methods for routine release testing of turoctocog alfa pegol has been adequately 
demonstrated. 
Batch analyses 
Batch analyses data of commercial scale batches used for clinical trials (or planned to be used), setting 
specifications or stability studies, process justification and process performance qualification have been 
presented. 
The batch analyses data show consistency of the product throughout development. 
Compared to the active substance no new product related impurities are detected in the finished product 
by release and additional testing and levels of impurities are comparable for active substance and finished 
product. 
No safety concerns related to the observed levels of leachables have been identified. 
Reference materials 
Reference standards are discussed in the active substance section and are applicable for the finished 
product, as well. 
Container closure 
The drug delivery system is designed for reconstitution and administration of Novo Nordisk coagulation 
factor products. The user interface includes a vial (Ph. Eur. type I glass) with freeze dried finished 
product, a vial adapter (CE marked) in a protective cap, a syringe with diluent and a plunger rod, as 
illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Graphic depiction of the drug delivery system used for turoctocog alfa pegol 
Studies have been performed with the vial adapter and the turoctocog alfa pegol finished product in order 
to test compatibility, extractables and leachables. The container closure integrity was confirmed. Usability 
testing has been performed. Drawings and acceptable release results of batches of vials and lots of 
lyophilisation stoppers have been provided. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 30 months at 5°C ± 3°C, where the finished product may be kept at or below 30°C for a 
single period up to 12 months has been claimed with an in-use-stability of 24 hours at 5°C or 4 hours at 
maximum 30°C. 
Stability studies have been performed on primary, supportive and PPQ batches at long term (5°C, 5°C 
followed by 30°C, and 30°C) and accelerated conditions. The stability studies were performed in line with 
the relevant ICH guidelines. 
o  Primary stability studies: finished product batches with active substance from the commercial 
process; commercial scale 
o  Supportive stability studies: finished product batches with active substance from the pivotal 
process; commercial scale 
o  PPQ stability studies: PPQ batches; commercial scale 
o 
In-use-stability study 
Data available from the primary study, final data from the supportive study and updated data from the 
PPQ study show an acceptable and comparable stability behavior.  Based on the stability results the 
claimed shelf life of 30 months at 5°C ± 3°C, where the finished product may be kept at or below 30°C for 
a single period up to 12 months can be accepted. The proposed in-use-stability of 24 hours at 5°C or 4 
hours at maximum 30°C is considered acceptable. 
0.9% Sodium Chloride – Solvent 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The solvent (0.9% sodium chloride) is manufactured at a contract manufacturer. A flow diagram for the 
manufacturing process has been provided. Critical steps and intermediates in the production of the 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Solution were appropriately defined. The process validation has shown that the 
manufacturing process reproducibly results in uniform products, which are in compliance with the 
acceptance criteria for in-process controls and the finished product specification. Acceptable information 
on terminal sterilisation qualification was submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019

Specification 
0.9% sodium chloride solution complies with the monograph for Sodium Chloride Injection in USP; 
therefore no further justification of specification is required. 
Batch analysis results obtained for the process validation batches of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution at 
release have been presented in the dossier, all batches were within the specification limits. 
The container closure system comprises a syringe barrel, a V-OVS 10.6 syringe closure system and a 
rubber plunger. The tip cap of the syringe closure system (i.e. product contact part) is also made of the 
bromobutyl rubber formulation in compliance with Ph. Eur. and USP. For syringe barrel, rubber plunger 
and syringe closure system a supplier Certificate of Conformity (CoA) and the routine incoming test 
procedures that are performed on delivery are listed. Drawings of the components have been provided. 
Extractables/Leachables were investigated, the related safety assessment lead to the conclusion that the 
calculated maximum daily clinical exposure levels to all leachables were below the applied exposure or 
threshold limit. Container/Closure Integrity was adequately investigated.  
Stability 
Stability data for process validation (PV) batches of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution in prefilled syringe 
(PFS), which have been stored at the following storage conditions have been provided: 
Long term storage: 
• 
• 
60 months at 5°C±3°C/ambient humidity 
60 months at 30°C±2°C/65% RH±5%RH 
Accelerated storage: 
• 
6 months at 40°C±2°C/75% RH±5%RH 
The stability studies were performed according to current ICH stability guidelines. 
All results complied with the specification and no significant changes were seen. The data support a shelf 
life of 60 months at +5 to +30˚C. 
Adventitious agents 
Overall, the risk of contamination of turoctocog alfa pegol with adventitious agents is considered very low. 
Complementary measures have been implemented at various steps of the manufacturing process of 
turoctocog alfa pegol to minimize the risk of adventitious agents:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
turoctocog alfa pegol and raw materials are manufactured without any animal- or human-derived 
componentss 
cell banks for turoctocog alfa pegol and raw materials have been extensively tested for the 
absence of adventitious viruses and microbial contamination 
each unprocessed harvest (turoctocog alfa pegol and raw materials) is tested for absence of 
adventitious viruses and microbial contamination 
robust and effective overall virus clearance by orthogonal manufacturing process steps has been 
demonstrated. Beside chromatography steps, the manufacturing process includes dedicated 
virus clearance steps effective against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.  
No animal- or human-derived raw materials are used for manufacture of turoctocog alfa pegol and raw 
materials and hence the viral and risk for TSE is deemed negligible.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality dossier was provided in a well-structured and organized manner, supported by explanative 
tables and flowcharts.  
The manufacturing processes for active substance and finished product as well as for the solvent used for 
reconstitution have been described in sufficient detail; all raw and starting materials including the cell 
banks used in the manufacture are listed identifying where each material is used in the process. Activated 
PEG is purchased from a qualified supplier, manufacture of the activated PEG is performed under GMP 
conditions. Being a critical material activated PEG is defined as intermediate in the manufacture of 
Esperoct. Information on the quality and control of these materials has been provided. All excipients used 
for finished product formulation and the solvent comply with the Ph. Eur. An appropriate control strategy 
ensures that material of sufficiently high quality will be supplied.  
Relevant process controls and in-process controls ensure a consistent routine manufacture. Process 
validation supports the conclusion that the manufacturing process for active substance as well as for 
finished product and solvent reliably generates active substance respective finished product meeting its 
predetermined specifications and quality attributes.  
The provided active substance and finished product as well as solvent batch analyses data support this 
conclusion. Comparability throughout the development has been demonstrated.  
Container/closure systems comply with compendial requirements, for the co-packaged fluid transfer 
device (vial adapter) a CE-certificate and EC Declaration of Conformity have been provided. 
The risk for transmission of adventitious agents is adequately controlled and minimized by 
complementary measures at various stages of the manufacturing process. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Sufficiently detailed data and documents have been provided indicating that the product can be 
reproducibly manufactured and is adequately controlled. The quality of this product is considered to be 
acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
Based on the review of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that the application to the 
marketing authorisation for Esperoct is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended an additional point for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology program for Esperoct comprised a number of in vitro and in vivo studies investigating 
primarily any inhibitory effects of the PEG moiety on FVIII binding as well as the acute and prophylactic 
haemostatic activity of Esperoct in comparison to non-pegylated rFVIII products. The nonclinical 
toxicology programme was performed in two pharmacologically relevant species: the rat and the 
Cynomolgus monkey. The route of administration in the toxicity studies was i.v. as this is the intended 
clinical route of administration.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Esperoct is a turoctocog alfa molecule (N8) with a single 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) primarily 
attached to an O-glycan in the truncated B-domain through a glycine-based linker. When Esperoct is 
activated by thrombin, the B-domain containing the PEG moiety and the a3-region are cleaved off, thus 
generating activated rFVIII (rFVIIIa) which is similar in structure to native FVIIIa (Figure 4). 
Figure 4 - Schematic representation of N8-GP before and after activation 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed to analyse and characterise the pharmacological 
properties of Esperoct. The pharmacodynamic properties have been compared to other non-pegylated 
rFVIII products (Advate and/or NovoEight [N8]). Safety pharmacology end points were included in the 
GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in male Cynomolgus monkeys (Table 3). For all in vivo studies, the route 
of administration was i.v. corresponding to the intended clinical route of administration.

Safety pharmacology end points (blood pressure [cuff], electrocardiography [ECG, fixed limb leads], 
respiratory rate [rate and depth], temperature, neurological/central nervous system (CNS) end points 
[behavioural, neurological and autonomic measures] and urinalysis) were incorporated in the 2-week GLP 
repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. No effects on any of the safety pharmacology 
parameters were observed up to the highest dose of 2500 IU/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
An overview of the PK and distribution, metabolism and excretion studies performed to support clinical 
development is shown in Table 4. The route of administration in the PK studies was i.v. as this is the 
intended clinical route of administration. Single-dose PK of Esperoct was compared to that of rFVIII (N8, 
ReFacto and/or Advate).

plasma. For the GLP toxicity studies, one-stage clot activity assays were validated for use in monkey and 
rat plasma. Common for these assays is that they describe the exposure of the protein part of the 
molecule. The chromogenic and one-stage clot activity assays cannot distinguish between Esperoct and 
the animals’ endogenous FVIII. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the one-stage clot assays 
validated for rat and monkey was high due to the high endogenous FVIII activity in the FVIII replete 
animals (250 IU/dL + endogenous FVIII, resulting in LLOQ range of 582−773 IU/dL). Exposure could thus 
not be measured at dose levels <150 IU/kg in FVIII replete animals. Screening for anti-Esperoct 
antibodies in rat and Cynomolgus monkey plasma was carried out using a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Rat 
and Cynomolgus monkey plasma samples measured positive for anti-Esperoct binding antibodies were 
analysed in a neutralising antibody assay. To assess exposure of the PEG part of the molecule in plasma, 
tissues, urine and faeces, a tritium (3H) radiolabel was used for distribution and excretion studies. To 
assess the fate of the protein part in tissues, a iodine (125I) tracer incorporated in the protein backbone 
was used. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to analyse PEG concentrations in plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the chronic toxicity studies, plasma LLOQ 0.38 μg/mL. 
Absorption  
Single-dose pharmacokinetics 
Overall, prolonged exposure of Esperoct was shown compared to rFVIII in all species evaluated, 
exemplified for dogs in Figure 5. 
Figure 5 PK profiles in haemophilia A dogs comparing Esperoct with N8 
After i.v. administration of Esperoct, the plasma FVIII activity appeared to decline monoexponentially in 
all species and the PK was well described by a 1-compartment pharmacokinetic model.

Table 6 Mean pharmacokinetic parameter estimates after single i.v. administration of rFVIII 
(N8 or ReFacto) and Esperoct at dose levels 125−280 IU/kg 
The dose proportionality was studied in F8-KO mice (35−280 IU/kg). Exposure (AUC and Cmax) 
increased with dose and no major differences in the dose-normalised PK parameters between the dose 
levels were found, which indicates that the PK of N8-GP are dose proportional in the dose range 35−280 
IU/kg when administered intravenously to F8-KO mice. 
Repeat-dose pharmacokinetics 
Neutralising antibodies developed in both FVIII replete rats and monkeys affecting exposure after 25 and 
11−15 days (Figure 6), respectively. Hence chronic toxicity studies (> 2−4 weeks) in standard toxicity 
species were not considered meaningful.

Exposure increased with dose on day 1 in the two pivotal 2-week GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
Wistar rat and Cynomolgus monkey. After repeated dosing, exposure generally decreased over time for 
both rat and monkey due to development of neutralising antibodies (table 7). 
Table 7 Toxicokinetic parameters from 2-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in Wistar rat and 
cynomolgus monkey 
The Rowett nude rat was introduced to circumvent the immune system in order to be able to assess 
chronic toxicity of Esperoct (incl. PEG). The Rowett nude rat lacks the thymus and does not develop 
T-cell-dependent anti-drug antibodies. The feasibility of the Rowett nude rat was assessed in a 6-week 
repeat-dose PK study confirming feasibility of the model (i.e., no anti-drug antibodies and similar t½ and 
exposure at the end of the 6-week treatment period as after a single dose). 
Exposure was confirmed in the majority of animals in the two pivotal (GLP) toxicity studies performed in 
the Rowett nude rat through the dosing periods of 26 and 52 weeks (Figure 7). For dose levels 500 and 
1200 IU/kg every 4th day, exposure was observed to increase with dose. Only few (< 4%) animals 
developed neutralising anti-drug antibodies during the study. No formal conclusions could be made on 
dose proportionality and accumulation in the Rowett nude rat as toxicokinetics only could be assessed of 
the two highest doses due to the high LLOQ of the one-stage clot assay.

The PK of Esperoct was shown to scale allometrically across mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and dogs (Figure 
8). Clearance and volume of distribution were scalable between the species with R2 > 0.93. Based on the 
power functions described in the figure, human clearance and volume of distribution were predicted to 1.4 
mL/h/kg and 32 mL/kg, respectively (75 kg).

Distribution, metabolism and excretion 
To follow the fate of PEG, the PEG moiety of Esperoct was radiolabelled and used in distribution and 
excretion studies. The analysis methods used in these studies are quantitative and enabled measuring 
PEG concentrations in plasma and tissue over time. The distribution of 40 kDa PEG-related radioactivity 
(PEG-related radioactivity or just PEG has been used interchangeable below) was followed for up to 12 
weeks after a single i.v. dose. Initially for the distribution and the first excretion study, a very high dose 
(4.1 mg/kg) of Esperoct was used relative to the maximum recommended clinical dose in order to be able 
to detect PEG for up to 12 weeks post-dose (Table 10). An additional excretion study with a lower dose 
(0.17 mg/kg) was performed subsequently. 
Table 10 Doses used in distribution and excretion studies compared to clinical dose 
Distribution 
The tissue distribution data showed that PEG-related radioactivity was widely distributed into tissues and 
gradually eliminated from tissues over the 12-week period (Figure 9). The highest levels of radioactivity 
were found in highly vascularised tissue/organs and the lowest levels in the CNS (brain and spinal cord). 
The data show that after uptake in tissues, PEG is re-distributed to the lymphatic system before 
elimination. Approximately half of the tissues contained quantifiable levels of radioactivity at the final 
sampling time (12 weeks post-dose).

Figure 9 PEG concentration versus time profiles for selected tissues and time points 
The distribution profile was similar to that reported for the 40 kDa PEG itself and other 40 kDa PEGylated 
proteins. A micro-autoradiography part was also included in the studies in order to assess distribution into 
selected tissue (liver, kidney, spleen, brain, testis, heart, adrenal and bone marrow) at a microscopic 
level at selected time points (1, 24 and 96 h). Overall, the micro-autoradiography complemented the 
results obtained in the quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) studies detecting radioactivity in 
the same organs. 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies were performed.  
Excretion 
Excretion (mass balance) was investigated in rats following a single i.v. dose of 0.17 mg/kg or 4.1 mg/kg 
Esperoct. Plasma, urine and faeces were sampled for up to 12 weeks post-dose. The excretion studies 
showed that PEG-related radioactivity was excreted in both urine (34−63%) and faeces (33−38%) over 
the 12-week period. The average interpolated excretion recovery for PEG of N8-GP was found to be 78% 
for the 4.1 mg/kg dose and 104% for the 0.17 mg/kg dose, respectively. As shown in the distribution 
study, PEG was gradually eliminated from tissues over the 12 weeks with some tissues still having a 
quantifiable PEG concentration; which explains why 6−7% PEG-related radioactivity still remained to be 
excreted from the carcass after 12 weeks post-dose. 
Esperoct was shown to be widely distributed, gradually eliminated from all tissues over time and excreted 
in urine and faeces. 
Drug-drug interactions 
Nonclinical drug interaction studies were not performed. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
The in vivo anatomical and hepatocellular distribution of the protein part of Esperoct was investigated in 
several whole body and physiological liver perfusion models in the rat using N8-GP iodine (125I) labelled in 
Assessment report

Page 32/144 
 
 
 
 
the protein backbone; this radiolabel follows the protein part of the molecule. N8 was included for 
comparison in some of the investigations. 
In the anatomical distribution studies, the majority of radioactivity originated from the blood. The liver 
was observed as the major organ for Esperoct distribution; some radioactivity was detected in the 
intestines at time points > 1 h. Weak signals were detected in kidneys, spleen and lungs at early time 
points. When comparing clearance of N8 and Esperoct in an in situ liver perfusion model, N8 was found to 
be cleared approximately 2.5 times faster than Esperoct. 
In the liver, in an experiment where liver cell fractions were isolated, Esperoct was found mainly to be 
distributed to hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and very little to Kupffer cells. In primary 
hepatocytes in vitro, the specific binding and internalisation of Esperoct was found to be approximately 
40% decreased compared to N8. The data show that the protein part of Esperoct is cleared via the liver, 
with hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells playing a key metabolic role. Liver metabolism of 
Esperoct was delayed compared to N8 corresponding to the prolonged circulation of Esperoct in blood. 
No notable uptake of [3H]PEG-N8-GP into red blood cells was observed over the concentration range 4 to 
20 μg/mL (0.036 and 0.178 MBq/mL) and the anticoagulant used did not affect uptake at the test 
concentrations investigated. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Overview of the toxicological studies 
The nonclinical toxicology programme was performed in two pharmacologically relevant species: the rat 
and the Cynomolgus monkey (Table 11). The route of administration in the toxicity studies was i.v. as this 
is the intended clinical route of administration.  
Table 11 Overview of toxicity studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 33/144 
 
 
 
 
Single dose toxicity 
The objective of this study was to determine if Esperoct (NNC0129-0000-1003), a 40kDA PEGylated 
human recombinant coagulation factor FVIII, was tolerable at high doses (20,000 and 25,000 U/kg) in 
rats (Table 12). The animals were observed for 3 days and hereafter necropsied. Assessment of toxicity 
was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, organ weights, and macroscopic and 
microscopic examinations. 
Table 12 Dose groups in the single dose toxicity study 
No mortality or clinical signs occurred during the study. There was a marked body weight gain in Group 4, 
which was considered not to be of toxicological significance. There was no treatment related effect on the 
absolute organ weight and organ weights relative to body weight and at necropsy there were no 
macroscopic findings. There was a large thrombus under organisation in a pulmonary vessel in one animal 
in Group 2. The change was associated with perivascular inflammation. The lung parenchyma seemed to 
be unaffected in this animal. The change could be due to the experimental procedure (injection in a tail 
vein) or to the haemostatic effect of the compound Esperoct. Across dose groups including vehicle 
controls, changes due to the experimental procedure, were observed and included focal epidermal 
hyperplasia, scabs, and epidermal and dermal inflammatory cell infiltration at the injection site. The 
remaining microscopic findings, such as focal basophilic tubules in the kidneys, periportal inflammatory 
cell infiltration in the liver, focal alveolar haemorrhages and osseous metaplasia in the lungs, were 
attributable to species and strain. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Esperoct was well tolerated after repeat dosing up to 2500 IU/kg every 2nd day for two weeks in Wistar 
rats and up to 1200 IU/kg every 4th day for 26 and 52 weeks in Rowett nude rats. In Cynomolgus 
monkeys, Esperoct was administered up to 2500 IU/kg every 3rd day for two weeks. For repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, the highest dose levels tested were identified as no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) based on non-immunogenic effects. 
Anti-drug antibodies developed in both rats and monkeys after repeated dosing affecting exposure after 
25 and 11−15 days, respectively. This is consistent with the foreign nature of the human FVIII protein of 
Esperoct in rats and monkeys. In Cynomolgus monkeys, the anti-drug antibodies cross-reacted to 
endogenous FVIII, this resulted in acquired haemophilia. Thus chronic toxicity studies in Wistar rat and 
Cynomolgus monkey > 2−4 weeks were not considered feasible or meaningful. As a consequence, the 
Rowett nude rat was introduced to minimise anti-drug antibody formation in order to be able to assess 
chronic toxicity of Esperoct (incl. PEG). The Rowett nude rat lacks the thymus and does not develop 
T-cell-dependent anti-drug antibodies. The feasibility of using the Rowett nude rat for chronic toxicity was 
confirmed as only very few rats (< 4%) developed anti-drug antibodies after 26−52 weeks of exposure. 
A pharmacological effect of Esperoct was seen in rats and monkeys across all dose groups (i.e., 
shortening of APTT) confirming exposure also in the low dose groups (< 150 IU/kg) where exposure was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019

below the LLOQ in the bioanalytical assays (250 IU/dL + endogenous FVIII, resulting in LLOQ range of 
582−773 IU/dL). 
In the Esperoct chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies in Rowett nude rats, immunohistochemistry staining 
of the brain tissue to assess of PEG distribution was included. PEG was not detected in any brain tissue 
(including the choroid plexus). Plasma PEG concentration was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) in the 52-week chronic toxicity study after 26 and 52 weeks of repeated dosing of 1200 IU/kg 
every 4th day and after 2 weeks of recovery. PEG concentrations were measured around or below the 
LLOQ of 0.38 μg/mL. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples taken at terminal kill after 52 weeks of dosing 
and after end of recovery, PEG was not measurable by NMR. 
Unscheduled deaths occurred in 11 out of 216 Rowett nude rats in the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
(3 at 0 IU/kg/dose, 0 at 50 IU/kg/dose, 4 at 150 IU/kg/dose, 1 at 500 IU/kg/dose, 3 at 1200 IU/kg/dose), 
and in 44 out 258 Rowett nude rats in the 52-week repeat-dose toxicity study (13/66 at 0 IU/kg/dose, 
6/42 at 50 IU/kg/dose, 7/42 at 150 IU/kg/dose, 8/42 at 500 IU/kg/dose, 10/66 at 1200 IU/kg/dose). The 
majority of these deaths appeared to be related to non-specific inflammatory processes or tumour 
development. The deaths were equally distributed in control and treated groups and consequently 
considered incidental and not treatment-related. 
Despite the immuno-compromised nature of the model, a few animals (< 4%) developed anti-drug 
antibodies in the 26- and 52-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in Rowett nude rats. Anti-drug antibody 
positive animals had a longer APTT and lower exposure, indicating that the development of anti-drug 
antibodies limited the pharmacologic action of Esperoct. It has been described that “T-like” cells in T-cell 
deficient nude rats increase with age, which is consistent with the few animals developing anti-drug 
antibodies in these studies. As expected in an immune-compromised animal, a number of incidental 
tumours were seen across dose groups (i.e., both control and Esperoct-treated Rowett nude rats). There 
was no indication of a treatment relationship and most of the tumours have been seen as normal 
background findings in other rat strains. 
In Table 13, the weekly doses given in the nonclinical repeat-dose toxicity studies identified as NOAEL are 
compared to the clinical weekly prophylactic dose regimen in children and adults.

Genotoxicity 
No in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity studies were performed in line with recommendation in ICH S6(R1).  
Assessment report

Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed.  
Coagulation FVIII 
There are no mechanistic data to suggest a mutagenic or proliferative potential of FVIII. There is no in 
vitro or in vivo evidence suggesting that rFVIII of Esperoct has biologic properties other than those of 
native, endogenous FVIII. Furthermore, Esperoct is intended for replacement therapy in chronic deficient 
patients, and a twice weekly dose regimen for prophylaxis will result in plasma activity levels within or 
below the physiological normal range. 
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
A number of PEGylated drugs have been approved, and the majority of the approved products have been 
tested in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests, all of which were negative. For Omontys (40 kDa PEG 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent), carcinogenicity studies were conducted and the studies were negative 
for a carcinogenic potential. For Somavert (5 kDa PEG human growth hormone analogue), tumours were 
seen at the injection site after two years of daily subcutaneous administration, most likely caused by local 
irritation. None of these results indicates that 5−40 kDa PEG poses a risk for mutagenicity or 
carcinogenicity. 
Esperoct - repeat-dose toxicity studies 
The repeat-dose toxicity studies did not indicate any signals suggesting increased carcinogenic risk. 
Standard repeat-dose toxicity studies in relevant models are useful for detecting signals for increased 
carcinogenic risk. Observations of increased organ weight, tissue hyperplasia, cell proliferation, immune 
suppression or endocrine/hormonal changes may indicate increased concern for carcinogenic potential. 
No such findings were observed in either the 26- or the 52-week toxicity studies in Rowett nude rats. All 
inter-group differences from control were minor or lacked dose relationship and were within normal 
variation. As expected in an immune-compromised animal, a number of incidental tumours were seen 
across dose groups (i.e., both in control and Esperoct treated Rowett nude rats). There was no indication 
of a treatment relationship, and the tumours have been seen as normal background findings in other rat 
strains. The Rowett nude rat strain has been described by Hanes; however, as limited background data 
are available, background data on other rat strains were used as references. 
Literature search 
Literature searches with search terms related to cancer (cancer, oncology, neoplasm, tumour, 
metastasis, angiogenesis, leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, adenoma, mitogenicity, pre-cancer, 
multiplication, proliferation, malign), PEG and FVIII were performed in 2017. The searches included the 
following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, BIOSIS Previews Current Contents search. No cause for concern 
for increased cancer risk of either FVIII or PEG was identified. 
In the majority of the references in the search related to PEGylated products, the association to cancer 
terms was related to the mechanism of action of the protein part of the product or the indication of the 
compound. No cause for concern related to the PEG part of the proteins was identified. 
The search relating to FVIII and cancer terms did not reveal a cause for concern for substitution therapy 
with plasma or recombinant FVIII in haemophilia A patients. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive toxicity studies have performed based on the fact that no indication of adverse effects on 
reproductive organs was seen by histopathological evaluation in sexually mature male and female rats.

Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated 
No target organs were identified in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys and thereby no 
toxicity with special relevance for children has been identified. No safety concerns that could be related to 
PEG were identified in the chronic toxicity with Esperoct for up to 52 weeks of duration; PEG was not 
detected in brain tissue (incl. choroid plexus) with a sensitive IHC method, and no treatment-related 
vacuolation was seen in any tissues. The repeat-dose toxicity studies covered juvenile, adolescent and 
adult ages (Table 14). Therefore additional studies in juvenile animals were not deemed relevant. 
Table 14 Age of animals in repeat-dose toxicity and corresponding human age 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic analysis was based on an activity (clot) assay which also measures the activity of the 
endogenous FVIII. 
In immunocompetent Wistar rats, exposure to Esperoct could not be confirmed for animals given 100 
U/kg/dose, due to all samples being below the LLOQ. In the control group, all samples were below the 
LLOQ. Most animals administered Esperoct at dose levels of 500 or 2500 U/kg/dose were systemically 
exposed to the test compound on Day 1. On Day 7, approximately half of the animals at the intermediate 
(500 U/kg/dose) and high (2500 U/kg/dose) dose levels showed exposure to Esperoct; while on Day 9, no 
exposure could be observed in any of the sampled animals. On Day 13, exposure could only be confirmed 
for three out of 30 animals at a dose level of 500 U/kg/dose and for three out of 35 animals at a dose level 
of 2500 U/kg/dose. On Day 27, exposure was observed in two out of 30 animals at a dose level of 2500 
U/kg/dose. The terminal half-life (t½) was in the range 7.4 to 23 hours on Day 1, but could not be 
determined on Day 13 or Day 27. Due to the lack of sufficient data, no conclusions could be drawn 
regarding sex differences. Following intravenous administration every other day for 13 days (500 or 2500 
U/kg/dose) or 27 days (2500 U/kg/dose), exposure to NNC 0129-0000-1003 decreased in both males and 
females. Cmax and AUC0-24h increased with dose between 500 and 2500 U/kg for both male and female 
animals on Day 1 of dosing. 
The inability to detect test item in the animals was due to a high lower limit of quantification of the 
employed FVIII activity assay resulting from a combination of matrix effects and cross-reactivity with 
endogenous FVIII. The toxicokinetic investigations confirmed systemic exposure to Esperoct in the 
majority of animals receiving 1200 U/kg and in approximately half of the animals receiving 500 U/kg. At 
the lower dose level only one or two samples from animals given 150 U/kg had quantifiable levels and at 
50 U/kg there were no quantifiable levels of the test material. 
In the immunocompromised Rowett nude rats, toxicokinetic investigations confirmed systemic exposure 
to Esperoct in Week 52 in 13/15 males and 10/15 females given 500 U/kg and 14/15 males and 9/15 
females given 1200 U/kg. Due to the high LLOQ for the FVIII activity assay only an occasional sample 
from animals given 150 U/kg had quantifiable levels whilst at 50 U/kg there were no quantifiable levels of

test material. At the once-monthly assessments, where samples were obtained at 4 hours post-dose, 
generally 0-2/6 samples in animals given 150 U/kg, 4-6/6 samples in animals given 500 U/kg, 4-6/6 
samples in animals given 1200 U/kg had quantifiable levels of the test material. There was a clear 
indication for higher exposure in males compared to females for Cmax and AUC0-24h in animals given 
1200 U/kg and exposure increased with dose from 500 to 1200 U/kg. Due to the lack of an appropriate 
number of dose levels above the LLOQ and the considerable variability in exposure no conclusion could be 
made concerning dose proportionality and due to the considerable variability in the plasma concentration 
data no formal conclusions regarding time dependency and accumulation could be made, however as 
shortening of the activated partial thromboplastin time is a pharmacodynamic marker it can be confirmed 
that the animals in Groups 4 and 5 were exposed to Espeoct. One control sample on one occasion had 
FVIII activity values above the LLOQ but as this was only on a single occasion and there was no evidence 
that the control animal had been dosed with test material this contamination of the sample was 
considered to be ex-vivo and, as such, had no impact on the study. 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, all animals given Esperoct at dose levels of 500 and 2500 U/kg/dose were 
systemically exposed to the test compound. Exposure could be observed up to Day 10 in all animals with 
the exception of animal 25 (2500 U/kg/dose) in which exposure could only be observed up to Day 7. After 
the last dose, on Day 13, exposure above the LLOQ could only be shown for a few animals in the 500 and 
2500 U/kg dose groups. Generally, no exposure could be observed above the LLOQ at a dose level of 100 
U/kg/dose. This is due to lack of dilutional linearity in individual monkey plasma samples after spiking 
with a low drug concentration leading to a LLOQ above the endogenous FVIII activity. All analysed 
samples from the control animals were below the LLOQ. The terminal half-life (t½) could only be 
estimated for animals at dose levels of 500 and 2500 U/kg/dose, after the first dose at Day 1. The t½ was 
in the range 20 to 49 hours. After a single dose, Cmax and AUC0-72h increased with dose for all the 
animals in the 500 and 2500 U/kg dose groups. After 2 weeks, Cmax and AUC0-72h were greatly reduced 
and could only be determined for a few animals. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the i.v. repeat-dose toxicity studies and in a dedicated rabbit local 
tolerance study with i.v., i.a. and perivenous administration. The administration of Esperoct resulted in 
mild or no local reactions.

PEG safety 
No safety concerns that could be related to PEG were identified in the chronic toxicity studies with 
Esperoct for up to 52 weeks of duration, providing a very robust nonclinical safety evaluation of Esperoct. 
Further, PEG of Esperoct was shown to be eliminated from all tissues over time and excreted in urine and 
faeces. 
No treatment-related cellular vacuolation has been seen in the toxicity studies in rat and monkey 
administered Esperoct, in rat for up to 52 weeks of dosing. In order to assess potential distribution of PEG 
of Esperoct, a sensitive IHC staining technique for PEG presence was performed on brain tissue (including 
choroid plexus) in the 52-week chronic toxicity study in Rowett nude rats. PEG was not detected in any 
brain tissue (including the choroid plexus). Plasma PEG concentration was measured by NMR in the 
52-week chronic toxicity study after 26 and 52 weeks of repeated dosing of 1200 IU/kg every 4th day and 
after 2 weeks of recovery. PEG concentrations were measured around or below the LLOQ of 0.38 μg/mL. 
In CSF samples taken at terminal kill after 52 weeks of dosing and after end of recovery, PEG was not 
measurable by NMR. The clinical PEG dose administered with Esperoct in the suggested prophylactic dose 
regimen in children and adults is 2.5−3.0 μg/kg/week and is low compared to some of the approved 
PEGylated products (Table 15). 
Table 15 Estimated weekly PEG dose of N8-GP and approved PEGylated biopharmaceutical 
products 
Clinical PEG concentrations in tissues were estimated based on the tissue PEG concentrations and the PK 
observed of the 40 kDa PEG moiety in the single dose rat distribution and excretion studies with Esperoct 
radiolabelled in the PEG moiety. From these data, terminal elimination half-lives of PEG in tissues as well 
as time to reach steady state were estimated. The terminal elimination half-lives of PEG in tissues were

Page 39/144 
 
 
 
 
estimated by standard methods of fitting a regression line to the terminal elimination phase of the 
observed data from the rat distribution data. As time to steady state is solely dependent on half-life, time 
to steady state in each tissue was estimated by multiplying t½ with 3.3. A plasma tissue model was built 
to predict plasma and tissue PEG concentrations after multiple dosing in rat and humans. 
In rats, steady-state levels in all tissues were reached as predicted within the duration of the 52-week 
toxicity study, where no adversity was seen. 
The steady-state PEG concentration in plasma and tissues in rats is estimated to be 2‒4 fold higher than 
the steady-state concentration estimated obtained with the prophylactic dose regimen in children and 
adults. There were no safety concerns identified in patients treated with N8-GP. Out of a total of 270 
patients treated, 192 patients (including 63 children) have been treated for more than 3 years, 135 
patients (including 12 children) have been treated for more than 4 years and 16 patients (no children) 
have been treated for more than 5 years. 
The measured nonclinical steady-state PEG concentration at 1200 IU/kg every 4th day was around or 
below the LLOQ of the NMR method (LLOQ 0.38 μg/mL). The clinical PEG concentration is predicted to be 
2−4 fold lower than the nonclinical steady-state PEG concentration (i.e., < 0.2 μg/mL) and will thus not 
be measurable with the current NMR method. The steady-state PEG concentration predicted for the 
N8-GP prophylactic dose regimen is much lower than steady-state PEG concentration measured in 
children dosed weekly with Rebinyn/Refixia for up to 4.5 years (~5 μg/mL) and that measured in 
pregnant women dosed with Cimzia (~30 μg/mL). No safety issues related to PEG were identified in the 
clinical development programme with Rebinyn/Refixia. Thus the risk of PEG-related safety findings with 
N8-GP is considered low. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to EMA guideline “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for 
human use” substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from 
the guideline since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is a biological product consisting of a protein (rFVIII), coupled to polyethylene 
glycol (40K) via a chemical linker (cytidin-5’-sialic acid-glycyl). The active pharmaceutical ingredient, 
rFVIII, and the chemical linker are due to their composition expected to be readily biodegradable. 
Polyethylene glycol (40K) is not expected to be readily biodegradable but it is not hazard labelled 
according to the EU legislation and it has no known adverse effects to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
A comprehensive panel of in vitro and in vivo studies was employed to analyse the pharmacologic 
properties of Esperoct. Thereby the focus was mainly on excluding potential inhibitory effects of the newly 
introduced PEG-moiety as compared to the already marketed N8. Moreover, efficacy and the intended 
prolongation of the haemostatic effect as compared to non-pegylated rFVIII products were investigated. 
By in vitro assays it could be confirmed that the PEG molecule does not hamper essential PD-interactions 
of Esperoct with other plasma proteins. On the other hand, binding to clearance receptors was 
demonstrated to be reduced indicating a prolonged circulation half-life of Esperoct. Various functional 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 40/144 
 
 
 
 
 
assays were employed to assess the clotting activity of Esperoct. Thereby no difference to the clotting 
activity of N8 could be detected. 
In vivo studies were predominantly performed in F8-KO mice. The acute and the prophylactic haemostatic 
activity of Esperoct was comparatively assessed to N8 or Advate. No difference with respect to the acute 
pro-coagulatory effect could be detected between the pegylated and the un-pegylated rFVIII products. In 
contrast, haemostasis was significantly prolonged with Esperoct as compared to rFVIII after prophylactic 
administration. Moreover, Esperoct was demonstrated to have a preventive effect on joint bleeding and 
arthropathy. Finally, a study in haemophila A dogs revealed a correlation between PK and PD of Esperoct. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic attributes of turoctocog alfa pegol have been characterised for both the protein and the 
PEG part of the molecule. An extended half-life of Esperoct was shown in mice, rats, rabbits, and 
haemophilia A dogs when compared to unpegylated rFVIII. 
Minor accumulation was seen after repeated dosing in Rowett nude rats, consistent with the half-life 
determined in this species and the dosing intervals used. In Cynomolgus monkeys, pharmacokinetics 
could only be evaluated after the first dose as exposure decreased over time due to the early onset of 
development of cross-reactive neutralising FVIII antibodies in all animals tested. 
After single i.v. administration of radiolabelled Esperoct to rats, PEG related radioactivity was widely 
distributed and the highest levels of radioactivity were found in highly vascularised tissue and organs, 
whereas the lowest levels were detected in the CNS (brain and spinal cord). Moreover it was shown that 
PEG-related radioactivity was gradually eliminated from all tissue and excreted via both, urine and faeces. 
Very low amounts were detected in the brain at early time -points and in the choroid plexus and CSF. 
However, in the chronic toxicity and the distribution study it was shown that radio-labelled PEG moiety of 
Esperoct is located to the blood vessels and capillaries of the brain but not to the brain tissue itself. 
Toxicology 
No adverse effects were detected in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys up to doses of 1200 
and 2500 IU/kg, respectively. Thus, the highest dose tested was determined to be the NOAEL in either of 
the conducted studies.  
The applicant performed an extensive set of non-clinical studies in relevant rodent and non-rodent 
species and in agreement with recent guidelines to evaluate the toxicological profile of Esperoct.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No specific studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity were 
performed in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No specific developmental or reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted. However, adverse 
effects on reproductive organs could not be observed histopathologically during the RDT studies in rats. 
This approach is regarded acceptable, due to the target population of haemophilia A patients, a disease 
state almost exclusively found in males. 
Local tolerance 
A local tolerance study in rabbits did not reveal any adverse findings either. 
Other studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 41/144 
 
 
 
Comparative studies between the drug product manufactured before (pivotal) and after (commercial) the 
optimisation and movement of the drug substance manufacturing process to a new facility did not show 
any differences with regard to PD, PK and immunogenicity. 
Adverse findings related to the PEG-moiety of the drug product as seen with other pegylated products 
were not identified during any of the conducted studies.  Nevertheless, safety considerations and 
experience derived from other approved products containing >40 kDa PEG should be taken into account. 
Due to the nature of the drug product, specific studies on the environmental risk of N8-GP are not deemed 
necessary. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The primary in vitro and in vivo PD studies demonstrated no inhibitory effects of the PEG moiety on the 
efficacy of Esperoct as well as a prolonged haemostatic effect of the pegylated rFVIII N8-GP in comparison 
to un-pegylated rFVIII products and, therefore, support the clinical development and marketing 
authorisation of Esperoct.  
In line with PD results, PK studies revealed a prolongation of exposure to Esperoct in contrast to the 
non-pegylated products providing an extended protective haemostatic effect. 
Although no safety concerns arose from the toxicity studies performed, there remain uncertainties on 
potential long-term toxicological consequences of PEG accumulation, especially in juvenile individuals. 
Although non-clinical toxicity data with young animals were presented, they did not cover the age range 
of the paediatric population below the age of 12.  
Due to the limited knowledge in relation to whether the younger children would be more vulnerable for 
potential PEG induced effects, including cell vacuolation, than adults, an indication in children under 12 
years is currently not supported by the non-clinical data.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK data are available from the following studies: 
• 
• 
Trial 3776: first human dose trial - A multi-centre, open-label, dose escalation trial evaluating 
safety and pharmacokinetics of three single doses of Esperoct in patients with severe haemophilia 
A. Single-dose PK: 25, 50 or 75 IU/kg of previous FVIII product and N8-GP. 26 patients (20–60 
years) were enrolled. 
Trial 3859: pivotal trial - A multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised trial evaluating safety and 
efficacy, including pharmacokinetics, of Esperoct when administered for long-term prophylaxis 
and treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with severe haemophilia A. Pharmacokinetics: 50 
IU/kg single-dose (twice). Steady-state trough and recovery assessment during prophylaxis 
treatment. A subgroup of 24 patients (13–61 years) was enrolled for PK assessments. PK was 
assessed after the first dose and after approximately 28 weeks (visit 2a and 7, respectively). 
• 
Trial 3885: paediatric trial - A multinational, open-label, non-controlled trial on safety, efficacy 
and pharmacokinetics of Esperoct when administered for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding 
episodes in previously treated paediatric patients with severe haemophilia A. Pharmacokinetics: 
50 IU/kg (single-dose) of previous FVIII product and Esperoct. Steady-state trough and recovery 
assessment during prophylaxis treatment. A subgroup of 27 patients (0−5 and 6−11 years of 
age) was enrolled for PK assessments. PK was assessed at visit 1 (previous product) and visit 2 
(N8-GP). 
• 
Trial 4033: PK and safety of Esperoct manufactured by commercial process - A multi-centre, 
comparative, double-blinded, randomised cross-over trial investigating single-dose 
pharmacokinetics and safety of Esperoct from the pivotal process and Esperoct from the 
commercial process in patients with severe haemophilia A. 50 IU/kg (single-dose) of Esperoct 
manufactured by commercial process and Esperoct manufactured by pivotal process. 21 patients 
were enrolled (25−71 years of age). 
In all trials previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A, a FVIII activity level <1%, and no 
history of FVIII inhibitors were included.

Analytical methods:  
In CSR of study 3776 the main data are presented using a chromogenic assay with PSS as calibrator. 
According to CSR 3859 and 3885 the main conclusions are derived from PK evaluation using a 
chromogenic assay with NHP as calibrator. The main conclusions in study 4033 are based on data using 
another chromogenic assay (Coatest) with NHP as calibrator which was not pre-specified in the protocol. 
During the development programme the chromogenic assay with PSS as calibrator turned out to be the 
most suitable assay/calibrator combination. Therefore, primary PK analyses are based on this assay 
although this was not always pre-specified in clinical studies.  
PK data analysis: The pharmacokinetic properties of Esperoct were evaluated by the following 
pharmacokinetic parameters (as endpoints in the clinical trials): 
• 
Incremental recovery (IR), defined as C30min and/or C60min divided by dose and reported in 
([IU/dL]/[IU/kg]) (depending on sampling time Table 1–2) 
•  Area under the curve from time 0 to time for last measurable FVIII activity (AUC(0-t)) (IU×h/dL) 
•  Area under the curve from time 0 and extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) (IU×h/dL) 
• 
• 
Percent of area under the curve extrapolated based on the elimination rate constant (AUC(% 
extrap)) (only terminal part included) 
Terminal half-life (t½) (hours) 
•  Clearance (CL) (mL/h/kg) 
•  Mean residence time (MRT) (hour) 
•  Volume of distribution based on the terminal phase (Vz) (mL/kg) 
•  Volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) (mL/kg) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Terminal rate constant (1/h) 
FVIII activity 30 min post dosing (C30min) (IU/dL) 
FVIII activity 60 min post dosing (C60min) (IU/dL) 
FVIII activity 96 hours post dosing (C96h) (IU/dL) 
Time point of last quantifiable FVIII activity assessment (h) 
All pharmacokinetic endpoints for Esperoct were derived from observed pharmacokinetic profiles using 
non-compartmental methods. For all trials actual time of post-injection samples were collected and used 
to derive the pharmacokinetic endpoints. Furthermore, the doses were adjusted for actual volume and 
vial potency prior to calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters. All pharmacokinetic parameters are 
presented using summary statistics. 
To further assess the pharmacokinetics of Esperoct, pharmacokinetic parameters (Vss and CL) were 
estimated from the single-dose profile data in trials 3776, 3885, 3859 and 4033 based on a 
one-compartment distribution model with first-order elimination allowing for between patient variation, 
assuming linear kinetics (based on the dose linearity findings in trial 3776). The estimated 
pharmacokinetic parameters were then used to predict steady-state profiles. A similar approach was 
applied for patients’ previous products.

Pharmacokinetic comparison of different vial strengths 
500 IU/vial versus 2000 IU/vial 
In trial 3885, 13 paediatric patients 0-5 years of age had evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles with Esperoct 
after dosing of Esperoct from the 500 IU/vial (6 patients) or the 2000 IU/vial (7 patients). Overall, no 
systematic differences were observed between the two vial strengths in the individual pharmacokinetic 
profiles when considering the following. Patients were to receive 50 IU/kg independent of vial strength. 
However, the actual doses tended to be higher for the 2000 IU/vial (between 56 and 63 IU/kg) than the 
500 IU/vial (between 46 and 54 IU/kg). Furthermore, dosing from the 2000 IU/vial was more prevalent 
in the older than the younger children of this age group, which could explain the slightly lower mean 
clearance for the 2000 IU/vial than the 500 IU/vial.

As of the cut-off date for this document, 13 patients in the extension phase of trial 3859 were switched 
from the 2000 IU/vial to the 3000 IU/vial, which is the highest available vial strength, for prophylaxis 
treatment. Pre-dose and 30 minutes post-dose FVIII activity measurements were collected from both vial 
sizes, however, full pharmacokinetic profiles were not obtained with the 3000 IU vial. 
The incremental recovery after dosing of Esperoct from the 3000 IU/vial was within the same range as 
after dosing from the 2000 IU/vial with no apparent differences.

PK predictions 
Pharmacokinetic predictions of FVIII activity at steady state have been calculated for the different age 
groups and dosing regimens. 
The calculations show that patients of all age groups are predicted to have >5% FVIII activity coverage 
for the majority of time when dosed every 3‒4 days (72% to 95% of time, depending on dose regimen 
and age group). With the once weekly dose regimen in patients ≥ 12 years, patients would have >5% 
FVIII activity coverage for more than half of the time (57%)

Bioequivalence 
Study 4033 
This phase 1 trial was a multi-centre, comparative, double-blind, randomised cross-over trial 
investigating single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of Esperoct from the pivotal process and Esperoct 
from the commercial process in patients with severe haemophilia A. Patients ≥12 years were recruited 
from trial NN7088-3859 and were to return to trial NN7088-3859 upon completion of this trial.

Figure 15: Trial design 
Two batches of Esperoct were evaluated in the trial, i.e., one batch of Esperoct from the pivotal process 
(2000 IU/vial) and one batch of Esperoct from the commercial process (2000 IU/vial). A total of 22 
patients were screened to receive Esperoct from the pivotal process and Esperoct from the commercial 
process in a randomised cross-over design for 18 patients to complete two PK sessions. This was to allow 
for an adequate comparison of the PK between Esperoct from the pivotal process and Esperoct from the 
commercial process. 
The trial population was recruited from trial NN7088-3859 and included male patients with severe 
congenital haemophilia A (FVIII activity <1%) without previous/historical or current FVIII inhibitors, and 
treated with >150 documented exposure days to FVIII products. 
Determination of sample size: Based on the data from trial NN7088-3859, a minimum of 18 patients were 
to receive each product in a randomised cross-over design to allow for adequate comparison of the PK 
between Esperoct from the pivotal and commercial process. It could be assumed that the within-patient 
variation in terms of coefficient of variation (CV) for AUC0-96h was up to 12%. Based on this assumption, 
above 90% power could be assumed to yield a 90% confidence interval of the ratio of AUC0-96h, norm 
(dosenormalised to 50 IU/kg) to be within 80-125% given the true ratio is 1.1 for the primary endpoint 
with a minimum of 18 patients. Hence, 18 patients were considered sufficient for this trial. 
The primary endpoint AUC0-96h was log-transformed and analysed using an ANOVA model with product, 
period, sequence and patient within sequence as factors. Estimated means with 2-sided confidence 
intervals for the back-transformed values were to be presented for each product. The 2-sided 90% 
confidence interval for the comparison between products (expressed as a ratio) was to be provided. In 
addition, outcome data was to be summarised by product and listed.

The pharmacokinetic properties of Esperoct were assessed in 3 Japanese patients in trial 3859 after 
dosing with 50 IU/kg (each having 2 profile sessions) and 2 Japanese patients in trial 3776 (dosed with 25 
and 75 IU/kg, respectively). For patients dosed with 50 IU/kg, the individual profiles for the Japanese 
patients were within the range of the remainder of the patients with no apparent pattern difference. 
Weight 
Of the 45 unique patients with evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles after dosing with 50 IU/kg in trials 
3776, 3859 and 4033, 27 patients were within the normal range (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), 12 patients had 
a BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2 and 6 patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 at baseline; and one had a BMI of 16.9 kg/m2. 
One of these patients appears in two BMI groups due to change of BMI from participation in trial 3859 to 
trial 4033, 
Theoretically, when dosing per kg BW, patients with a high BMI will receive a higher absolute dose than 
patients with a low BMI. Assuming that the plasma volume is subject to little change with increasing BMI, 
plasma FVIII activity would be expected to increase with increasing BMI, when dosing per kg body weight. 
For N8-GP, this would correspond to increasing incremental recovery and AUC with increasing BMI. 
However, only a limited effect of BMI on the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed (trending towards 
increasing AUC and IR with increasing BMI). When further considering the variability and overlap across 
BMI categories of the individual pharmacokinetic profiles, as well as the limited number of patients with 
BMI ≥30 kg/m2, no clear effect of BMI on the pharmacokinetics of N8-GP was observed.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Relationship between FVIII half-lives and von Willebrand factor level 
In adults and adolescents, the half-life of N8-GP tended to be longer with higher von Willebrand factor 
levels, while this appeared to be less pronounced for children. For children, pharmacokinetic data were 
also collected for patients’ previous product and the relationship between half-life and von Willebrand 
factor levels did not differ between N8-GP and the patients’ previous products, as evaluated by the widely 
overlapping confidence intervals for the slope estimates

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Esperoct is a purified recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) product with a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol 
(PEG) conjugated to the protein. The PEG is attached to the O-linked glycan in the truncated B-domain of 
rFVIII (turoctocog alfa). The mechanism of action of Esperoct is based on the replacement of the deficient 
or absent factor VIII in patients with haemophilia A. 
When Esperoct is activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the B-domain containing the PEG moiety and 
the a3-region are cleaved off, thus generating activated recombinant factor VIII (rFVIIIa) which is similar 
in structure to native factor VIIIa. 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand 
factor) with different physiological functions. When injected into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds 
to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated 
factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts 
prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously 
or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By factor VIII replacement therapy the plasma levels of 
factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction 
of the bleeding tendencies. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of Esperoct were based on FVIII activity. This parameter is known to 
correlate with clinical efficacy of FVIII products. Thus, the FVIII activity is to be considered 
pharmacodynamic in nature, as it reflects the biologic action of Esperoct. No other pharmacodynamic 
endpoints have been assessed in the clinical development programme for Esperoct.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Available PK data are derived from a total of four clinical studies. Study 3776 was a first human dose trial 
investigating three different dose levels of Esperoct as well as PK of Esperoct in comparison to that of the 
patients´ previous FVIII products. In the pivotal trial 3895 a subgroup of patients underwent PK 
evaluation at start of the trial and after approximately 28 weeks. PK parameters of Esperoct in the 
paediatric population were derived from study 3885. Additionally, a comparative, cross-over trial was 
conducted to compare PK of Esperoct manufactured by the pivotal process with that of the commercial 
process. 
The chosen PK parameters as well as number of patients fulfil the guideline requirements.  
Different assays (different chromogenic assays and a clotting assay) with different calibrators (PSS, NHP) 
were used throughout the clinical development programme. The chromogenic assay with PSS as 
calibrator has turned out to be the most suitable assays/calibrator combination. Therefore, the results 
from this assay and calibrator are considered the most useful. 
Modest prolongation of half-life of Esperoct, i.e. approximately 1.6-fold increase compared to the 
patients´ previous products was shown. As known from other FVIII products, clearance is higher and AUC 
as well as half-life is lower in the younger age group. Repeat PK did not reveal any significant differences. 
Obviously, results for PK parameters differ depending on the assay and calibrator used.  
In study 3859, PK results deriving from three batches were compared in accordance with the FVIII 
guideline. No apparent differences were seen.  
Results from PK predictions of FVIII activity at steady state were presented to assess prolonged treatment 
intervals. However, no information can be found how these predictions were calculated. Therefore, 
validity and reliability of these results could not be concluded.  
For study 4033 (comparison of pivotal and commercial product) patients were recruited from the ongoing 
study 3859. Only one batch of each product was used for comparison which is not in accordance with the 
GL. As a comprehensive comparability exercise on quality and preclinical level did not reveal any 
significant differences which might have an impact on efficacy and/or safety, this was considered 
acceptable.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, PK of Esperoct has been sufficiently characterised.

including Pharmacokinetics, of NNC 0129-0000-1003 when administered for 
Treatment and Prophylaxis of Bleeding in Patients with Haemophilia A  
Trial 3859 was a multi-national, multi-centre, open-label, non-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of 
N8-GP for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in adolescent and adult patients with severe haemophilia 
A. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also evaluated in this study. Patients were required to have at least 
150 exposure days to a previous FVIII product to be included in the trial. 
This trial consisted of a main phase followed by two extension phases.

least 50 EDs, and 10 patients had 20 bleeding episodes in the on-demand and/or the prophylaxis arm. 
Treatments 
Prophylaxis 
Main Phase: 
In the prophylaxis arm, one single bolus dose of 50 IU/kg of Esperoct was administered intravenously 
every 4 days (96 hours interval). The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in 
order to ensure a trough level of >1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of patients in the prophylaxis arm. 
During treatment, a shortening of the dosing interval for prophylaxis to twice weekly could be undertaken 
at the investigator’s discretion, if deemed necessary for the individual patient. If the dosing regimen was 
changed to twice weekly, doses were to be separated by at least 3 calendar days and no more than 4 
calendar days. Extra doses of Eseproct were administered if the patient experienced a 
treatment-requiring bleeding episode or in case of minor surgery. Patients who were switched to twice 
weekly dosing during the main phase were to continue receiving twice weekly dosing throughout the 
extension phase. Patients were only permitted to receive twice weekly dosing the extension phase if they 
had received twice weekly dosing in the main phase. 
Extension phase part 1 
Patients who were on prophylaxis treatment every 4 days dosing with Esperoct in the main phase of the 
trial and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were 
offered to be randomised to every 7 days or every 4 days treatment (2:1 randomisation). Patients with 3 
or more bleeding episodes within the last 6 months of the main phase as well as patients with low bleeding 
rates who were unwilling to be randomised, continued with N8-GP treatment every 4 days. 
The prophylaxis dose of 50 IU/kg Esperoct was administered every 4 days in the non-randomised group. 
In the randomised group, patients received either 50 IU/kg Eseproct every 4 days or 75 IU/kg Eseproct 
every 7 days, depending on which treatment arm the patient was allocated to. Based on the bleeding 
pattern, the investigator could change the treatment frequency from Q7D to Q4D at any time. Changing 
treatment frequency from Q4D to Q7D was not permitted. In addition, the investigator was to monitor the 
patient on an ongoing basis. A patient on Q7D prophylaxis had to be switched back to Q4D prophylaxis if 
either of the following criteria were met over an 8-week period: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 60/144 
 
 
 
 
• 
Two or more spontaneous bleeding episodes 
•  One severe bleeding episode requiring hospitalisation. 
Novo Nordisk monitored compliance with these requirements. Novo Nordisk monitored the number of 
patients switching from Q7D to Q4D treatment and planned to terminate the weekly treatment arm if at 
least 15 out of 30 patients (or 50% of 30 or more) who had been randomised to Q7D treatment were 
switched back to Q4D treatment. If this occurred, the Q7D arm was to be terminated and all remaining 
patients were to be switched to Q4D treatment. 
Extension phase part 2 
During extension phase part 2 it was possible to change the prophylaxis treatment of patients to Q4D or 
Q7D (same dose levels as in extension phase part 1). In order to change a regimen, the investigator had 
to monitor the patient on an ongoing basis and follow the rules below: 
•  A patient with 0–2 bleeding episodes within the last 6 months on same regimen was permitted to 
move to a less frequent dosing interval of Q7D. Change to a Q7D regimen was to be done while 
the patient was at a site visit. After switching, the patient had to attend the next sequential a-visit 
in line. It was mandatory for patients to attend 2 consecutive a-visits upon switching to Q7D 
treatment, in order to achieve visits every 4 weeks (±1 week) during the first 4 months. After this 
time period the patient had to attend visits every 8 weeks (±1 week) while on Q7D treatment. 
• 
If a patient on Q7D treatment over an 8-week period experienced two or more spontaneous 
bleeding episodes or one severe bleeding episode requiring hospitalisation, then the patient was 
to be switched back to Q4D treatment. The patient had to attend the next sequential visit in line 
and attend visits every third month while on Q4D treatment. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20–75 IU/kg according to the severity and location of 
the bleeding episode. The dose (Esperoct units) was calculated by multiplying the patient’s weight in 
kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5.

approximately 8 hours after a single injection. 
•  Good: definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours 
after one injection, but possible requiring more than one injection for complete resolution 
•  Moderate: probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 8 hours after the first 
injection; usually requiring more than one injection 
•  None: no improvement, or worsening of symptoms 
Sample size 
The trial had two co-primary endpoints for the pivotal part that both needed to succeed for the trial to 
succeed. The two endpoints were considered approximately independent and combined power was 
therefore calculated as the product of the individual power for each co-primary endpoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 62/144 
 
 
 
 
A sample size of 105 patients treated for a minimum of 50 exposure days was considered suitable for a 
reasonable evaluation of inhibitor formation in this pivotal trial. The aim was to demonstrate that the 
upper confidence limit for the inhibitor rate is below 6.8%. In practical terms this was to happen if 2 or 
less inhibitors were observed in the planned 105 patients with 50 exposure days (3 or less if the trail 
should end with 127 patients with 50 EDs). If the true inhibitor rate of Esperoct was 1%, then the 
chance/power to achieve a maximum 2 inhibitor out of 132 patients entered into the trial would have been 
85%. 
The clinical efficacy of Esperoct in long term bleeding prophylaxis was to be evaluated based on all the 
prophylaxis period data. This would give different period lengths for the different patients but on average 
it was expected to give about 12 month prophylaxis treatment per patient (~7 months for the last 
recruited patients and ~17-19 months for the first recruited patients). Prophylactic effect was planned to 
be concluded if the upper 97.5% confidence limit for the annualised bleeding frequency was < 8.5. The 
analysis model was Poisson regression allowing for over-dispersion. Based on an approximation to the 
normal distribution and assuming that the patients bleed 6.8 times per year and an over-dispersion of 5 
(so variance 34), 120 entering patients on prophylaxis were assumed to give a power of 89%.  
With 85% power for the first co-primary endpoint and 89% power for the second co-primary endpoint the 
combined power for the study with the given sample size was expected to be about 85%*89% = 76%. 
Eventually, approximately 172 patients were planned to be enrolled in the main phase of the trial 
including at least 12 patients in on-demand treatment and 160 patients in prophylaxis treatment after the 
adjustment of the sample size as a result of the interim analysis planned and carried out. The original 
power calculations for the ABR analyses assumed an over-dispersion of 5. For that reason, the 
over-dispersion was estimated when 90 patients had entered prophylaxis. This interim analysis was only 
based on number of bleeding episodes and exposure time on prophylaxis regimen.  
Randomisation 
At the screening visit, patients were assigned to either Q4D prophylaxis or on-demand treatment 
according to patient and investigator choice. At the end of the main phase, willing and eligible patients 
were randomised in a 2:1 manner to Q7D or Q4D treatment with Esperoct in extension phase part 1 using 
the IV/WRS. All other patients were to continue on the same treatment regimen they received in the main 
phase. In extension phase part 2, patients were to continue on either prophylaxis or on-demand 
treatment, according to the regimen they received in part 1. During part 2, patients in the prophylaxis 
arm were permitted to switch between Q4D and Q7D according to predefined criteria.  
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was open-labelled because the evaluation of the co-primary endpoints of the trial (incidence rate 
of FVIII-inhibitors ≥0.6 BU and annualised bleeding rate (ABR) in the prophylaxis regimen) was not 
expected to be influenced by the knowledge of treatment and there was no comparator treatment. 
Statistical methods 
The Pivotal part of the trial was reported based on all data from the Main Phase where all patients have 
reached at least 50 EDs (except for patients having had surgery as part of pathfinder™3), and all patients 
have had their first visit after 50 EDs where all planned assessments including inhibitors have been 
performed. All main conclusions from the trial are based on this reporting except for conclusions 
regarding every 7 day prophylaxis and long term safety/efficacy. In the analysis at end of extension phase 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 63/144 
 
 
 
 
part 1 all data from main phase up to the end of extension phase part 1 was analysed and reported. The 
main focus was on once weekly prophylaxis with every 4 day dosing as control where patients with low 
bleeding rate could be randomised to the two treatment arms. The main reason for the ‘interim’ analysis 
for the ongoing extension phase part 2 including all data from the main phase and extension phase up to 
the cut-off was to collect additional safety and efficacy data.  
Analysis sets 
Two analysis sets were planned for data evaluation: the full analysis set and the safety analysis set. 
Analysis methods for the coprimary endpoint 
The rate of inhibitors is reported and a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit is provided based on an 
exact calculation for a binomial distribution. For the calculation of the inhibitor rate the nominator 
included all patients with neutralising antibodies while the denominator included all patients with a 
minimum of 50 EDs plus any patients with less than 50 EDs but with inhibitors. Adequate safety with 
regard to inhibitors would be concluded if the upper 1-sided 97.5% confidence limit was below 6.8% 
corresponding to the upper 97.5% confidence limit if 2 inhibitors out of 105 patients were observed. The 
bleeding rate endpoint was analysed by a Poisson regression model on number of bleeding episodes per 
patient allowing for over-dispersion (using Pearson’s chi-square divided by the degrees of freedom [i.e. 
Scale=Pscale in SAS]) and using log planned observation duration as an offset. Estimates of the ABRs 
were provided with 95% confidence intervals. Prophylactic effect of Esperoct was to be concluded if the 
bleeding rate is significantly below 50% of the historical on-demand bleeding rate (i.e. significantly lower 
than 12) as well as within 25% of the historical prophylaxis bleeding rates (i.e. significantly lower than 
6.8*1.25 = 8.5). Since both criteria had to be met in practice, it was to be shown that the bleeding rate 
was significantly lower than 8.5. Let AR be the true yearly bleeding rate. The null-hypothesis tested 
against the alternative hypothesis as given by: 
H0: AR ≥ 8.5 against HA: AR < 8.5 
Analysis methods for the key secondary endpoint 
Haemostatic effect of Esperoct when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was assessed on a four point 
scale for haemostatic response (excellent, good, moderate and none) by counting excellent and good as 
success and moderate and none as failure. This endpoint was only to be analysed as a confirmatory 
secondary endpoint in the pivotal part if the analyses of the co-primary endpoints were both successful. 
Otherwise, this endpoint was be analysed only as a supportive secondary endpoint. Any bleeding episodes 
with missing response information will be counted as failures. The goal was to demonstrate that the 
success rate for Esperoct was at most 15% (absolute) worse than 80%. If R was the true success rate, the 
null-hypothesis to be tested against the alternative hypothesis was given by: 
H0: R ≤ 65% against HA: R > 65% 
Patient exposure times and Imputation strategies 
The co-primary and secondary endpoints have been investigated in the pivotal report and/or the 
extension phase part 1 report, as well as in the ‘interim’ report based on compiled data from the main 
phase, the extension phase part 1 and the extension phase part 2 up to data cut-off. Exposure time for 
patients completing the main phase, not continuing into the extension phase, was calculated as the time 
on the relevant treatment arm up to visit 13. Exposure time for patients completing the extension phase 
part 1, not continuing into the extension phase part 2, was calculated as the time on the relevant 
treatment arm up to visit 17. Exposure time for patients not withdrawing from the trial was calculated as 
the time on the relevant treatment arm up to (not including) the dosing time at the last visit prior to data 
cut-off. Observed exposure time for withdrawn patients was calculated as the time (on the relevant 
treatment arm) up to the end of trial visit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 64/144 
 
 
 
Bleeding rates were imputed for patients who withdrew prematurely. For the analysis of collected data 
until end of EXT1 (or until cutoff date in EXT2), ABR based on accumulated number of bleeding episodes 
including data from the main phase + the extension phase part 1 (+ the extension phase part 2) was 
evaluated for the Q4D dosing regimens combined and Q7D dosing regimens combined. Patients who 
switched from Q7D to Q4D were handled as withdrawals when calculating ABR for Q7D. For patients who 
changed from Q7D to Q4D more than once, their bleeds for Q7D were imputed based on the preceding 
consecutive period on Q7D until they switched to the Q7D dosing regimen again. If a patient switched 
from Q7D to Q4D within 1 month after starting on Q7D (irrespective of previous periods on Q7D), the 
number of bleeds was imputed assuming an ABR of 24. 
When calculating the ABR during Q4D treatment (randomised and non-randomised), during Q7D 
treatment (randomised and non-randomised) and during on-demand treatment, the following sensitivity 
analyses were performed:  
•  Analysis applying a different model: based on a negative binomial regression model 
•  Analysis without imputation to planned trial duration 
•  Analysis imputing by LOCF without imputation for withdrawals occurring within the first month 
•  Analysis imputing a minimum of 24 bleeds per year to planned trial duration 
•  Annualised bleeding rate by month for the first consecutive period on each treatment regimen 
•  Annualised bleeding rate by calendar month 
Sensitivity analyses for haemostatic response analysis: 
•  Analysis on observed responses only (i.e. excluding missing observations) 
•  Analysis imputing missing haemostatic response based on number of infusions used 
•  Analysis imputing missing haemostatic response based on patients recorded responses on other 
bleeding episodes 
•  Analysis methods for the Supportive Secondary Endpoints: Consumption of Esperoct (number of 
infusions and U/Kg) per bleed, consumption of Esperoct (number of infusions and U/Kg per 
month and per year) during prophylaxis and on-demand treatment, Haemostatic effect as 
measured by recovery and trough levels FVIII:C (in all patients in the prophylaxis treatment 
arm) 
Descriptive statistical methodology was planned for analysis of PK endpoints were to be descriptively 
summarised and individual PK endpoints were to be listed. Most PK endpoints were to be analysed using 
mixed effects model on log-transformed parameters including visit as fixed effect, and patient as random 
effects. Estimates of each endpoint with 95% confidence intervals were to be provided back-transformed 
to the natural scale. All PK profiles were to be presented graphically by subject and by visit.

Treatment compliance 
A total of 82 deviations were reported in this category. The majority of these deviations were related to 
patients being non-compliant with the prophylaxis dosing regimen, for most cases due to administration 
of the prophylaxis dose just outside the treatment window specified in the protocol. Other deviations 
included patients taking wrong doses and wash-out periods not being adhered to, there was one case of 
a patient using two DUNs after expiry date, and the trial drug was administered 4 and 8 days after expiry.

Treatment compliance 
A total of 193 deviations were reported in this category. The majority of these deviations were related to 
patients being non-compliant with the prophylaxis dosing regimen, for most cases due to administration 
of the prophylaxis dose just outside the treatment window specified in the protocol. Two patients 
transferred from on-demand treatment to Q4D prophylaxis. Other deviations included missing evaluation 
of haemostatic response, patients taking wrong doses, additional prophylactic dose administered, 
treatment non-compliance and incorrect doses administered. 
Baseline data 
The trial population consisted of male patients with severe haemophilia A. The mean age was 31.1 years 
(ranging from 12 to 66 years). 
The mean body weight of all patients was 75.5 kg (ranging from 39 to 122 kg). The majority of the 
patients were White (74.2%); the second largest group was Asian (18.8%). A total of 24.7% of the 
patients were from the US, 11.8% were from the United Kingdom, 8.1% were from Japan and 7.0% were 
from Germany, while the remaining patients were distributed between the other 18 countries. 
Twenty-five (25) adolescent patients aged 12−17 years were recruited from 7 countries including the US 
(48%), the United Kingdom (16%), Australia (12%) and Turkey (12%). The majority of adolescent 
patients were White (76%); the second largest group was Black or African American (12%). 
Haemophilia and treatment history 
All 186 patients included in the trial were male and had severe congenital haemophilia A (FVIII activity 
<1%) according to medical records. All patients were previously treated, with a history of at least 150 EDs 
to other FVIII products and no history of inhibitors. In all, 90 patients had relatives with haemophilia A. 
None of the patients enrolled had clinical suspicion of inhibitors. 
Before entry to the trial, 149 patients (80.1%) received regular prophylactic treatment; 13 patients used 
plasma-derived FVIII products and 136 used recombinant products. The remaining 37 patients (19.9%) 
followed an on-demand treatment regimen. In the subgroup of adolescent patients, all but one of the 
patients (95.8%) was receiving prophylactic treatment with either recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII 
products.

Treatments 
Table 44: Overview of treatments 
Prophylaxis treatment 
One single bolus dose of approximately 60 U/kg BW of N8-GP was administered intravenously every 3–
4 days. Whole-mL dosing in the range of 50-75 U/kg BW was enabled. Doses were separated by at least 
3 calendar days and no more than 4 calendar days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 86/144 
 
 
 
 
During treatment a shortening of the dosing interval for prophylaxis to twice weekly could be undertaken 
at the investigator’s discretion, if deemed necessary for the individual patient. Extra doses of N8-GP were 
administered, if the patient experienced a treatment-requiring bleeding episode or in case of minor 
surgery. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
Table 45: Recommended dose levels for treatment of bleeding episodes 
The bleeding episode was to be treated immediately at home if possible. The need for a second dose was 
to be evaluated within eight hours of the initial dose. If two doses were not sufficient to treat the bleeding 
episode (or in case of a severe bleeding episode) the clinic had to be contacted as soon as possible for 
further instructions and/or transport to the clinic for an unscheduled visit. Single doses should not exceed 
75 U/kg BW and total daily dose should not exceed 200 U/kg BW.  
If a haemostatic response could not be achieved after 48 hours using adequate doses of N8-GP when 
treating bleeding episodes, another FVIII product could be selected at the discretion of the investigator. 
This resulted in withdrawal of the patient. 
Treatment of suspected bleeding episodes 
In case of abdominal or head trauma where there is a risk of a severe traumatic bleeding episode it is 
allowed to initiate treatment before symptoms arise. This is defined as preventive treatment of suspected 
severe traumatic bleeding episode. The recommended dose is equivalent to treatment of a severe 
bleeding episode. 
In case of a suspected severe bleeding episode trial site must be contacted as soon as possible for further 
instructions and/or transport to the trial site for an unscheduled visit.  
Surgery 
Minor surgeries, dental extractions and placement of central venous access ports could be performed 
while participating in this trial by administering an extra dose of N8-GP equivalent to dose administered 
for a severe bleeding episode, or aligned to local practice. Patients in need of major surgery will be 
withdrawn from the trial. 
•  Definition of minor surgery: Any invasive operative procedure where only the skin, the mucous 
membranes or superficial connective tissue is manipulated. 
•  Definition of major surgery: Any invasive procedure that require several days of substitution 
therapy and/or where any one or more of the following occur: a body cavity is entered, a 
mesenchymal barrier (e.g. pleura, peritoneum or dura) is crossed, a fascial plane is opened, an 
organ is removed, normal anatomy is operatively altered, major elective orthopaedic surgery.

To evaluate patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
Incidence of inhibitory antibodies against FVIII ≥0.6 Bethesda units (BU) during the main phase of 
the trial (from 0-26 weeks of treatment) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Haemostatic effect of Esperoct when used for treatment of bleeding episodes and assessed as: 
Excellent, Good, Moderate, or None 
•  Number of bleeding episodes during prophylactic treatment with N8-GP (annualised bleeding 
rate) 
•  Consumption of Esperoct per bleeding episode (number of injections and U/kg) 
•  Consumption of Esperoct during prophylaxis (number of injections and U/kg per month and year) 
•  Changes in PRO scores from baseline to the end of treatment in the main phase, and during the 
extension phase 
Definitions of haemostatic response 
Haemostatic effect of the treatment of bleeding episodes were evaluated by the patient and/or 
parent(s)/caregiver 8 hours after the first injection and recorded in the eDiary. 
Definition of haemostatic effect: 
• 
Excellent: Abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 
approximately 8 hours after a single injection 
•  Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours 
after a single injection, but possibly requiring more than one injection for complete resolution 
•  Moderate: Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 8 hours after the first 
injection, but usually requiring more than one injection 
•  None: No improvement, or worsening of symptoms 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations have been performed.  
Randomisation 
This phase 3 trial was a multinational, open-label, single-arm and non-controlled trial.

Not applicable as the study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The main phase of the trial was reported based on all data from the main phase where all patients, except 
for patients who withdrew from the trial, have completed the main phase and reached at least 50 EDs. All 
main conclusions from the trial are based on this reporting.  
An ‘interim’ analysis based on the partial database lock including the data from the main phase and 
ongoing extension phase up to all patients’ last visit prior to the cut-off date was to be performed with the 
purpose of submitting trial results into Health authorities for marketing authorisation. Combined main 
and extension phase data were planned to be summarised in total and by age group (children 0-5 years 
old at screening and children 6 -11 years old at screening).  
At the end of the trial a full database lock was to be conducted and all data be reported. Summaries for 
continuous endpoints were to include total number (N), mean (SD), median and min/max and for 
pharmacokinetic endpoints also geometric mean and CV%. Summaries for discrete endpoints were to 
include N, number (n) and percentages (%) for each outcome category. 
Analysis sets 
All patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product were to be included in the Safety Analysis Set. All 
trial patients allocated to treatment for which at least one of the PK or efficacy endpoints was assessed 
were to be included in the Full Analysis set (FAS).  
Primary endpoint analysis method 
The inhibitor rate was defined as a number of patients with neutralizing inhibitors divided by the total 
number of patients with at least 50 EDs and patients who did not reach 50EDs but developed neutralizing 
inhibitors. A one-sided, upper 97.5% confidence limit was provided based on an exact calculation in the 
binomial distribution. 
Secondary endpoints analyses methods 
Haemostatic effect of N8-GP for treatment of bleeding episodes was assessed as: Excellent, Good, 
Moderate, or None. This endpoint was planned to be summarised and listed. In addition, success was 
defined as a response of Good or Excellent while failure was defined as Moderate, None or Missing. 
Success/failure was planned to be summarised both in total and by location of bleed, by cause of bleed 
and by country. The haemostatic effect as success/failure was also planned to be summarised excluding 
missing responses. Success rate and 2-sided 95% confidence interval were planned to be estimated using 
a logistic regression accounting for repeated measures within patient assuming compound symmetry 
working correlation matrix. 
The annualised bleeding rate (ABR) was to be estimated using a Poisson regression model with age group 
as a factor using log (prophylaxis duration) as offset and estimating over-dispersion by Pearson’s scale. 
The estimated ABR was to be presented together with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval. A sensitivity 
analysis based on a negative binomial regression model with number of bleeding episodes with age group 
as a factor, and adjusting for exposure time was also to be performed. 
The analysis of ABR was to be repeated to investigate the potential impact of early withdrawals by 
imputing number of bleeding episodes for withdrawals. For patients withdrawing prematurely the number 
of bleeding episodes counting in the analysis was to be imputed up to what they could be expected to have 
had if they had completed the trial. If e.g. a patient withdraws after 2 months with 3 bleeding episodes, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 89/144 
 
 
 
but the patient should have been in the study for 12 months, then this patient would in the analysis count 
as having had 18 bleeding episodes in 12 months. For patients who withdrew within 1 month imputation 
was to be conducted by assuming an annualised bleeding rate of 24 for the missing period. 
For patients withdrawn in the main phase the expected exposure time was estimated to be 182 days (26 
week * 7). For patients withdrawn in the extension phase, the expected exposure time was defined as the 
last patient last visit date – the date of the first dose + 1. ABRs were also to be estimated by age group 
(0-5 years and 6-11 years), by race, by ethnicity, by cause of bleed, by location of bleed, by country, by 
month in trial and by time since last dose (<= 2 days, > 2 days).

Changes to the planned statistical analyses during extension 1 
Previously it was planned to report the extension phase analysis separately when the trial has completed. 
It was decided to perform an interim analysis during the ongoing extension phase of the trial for 
application for marketing authorisation. Therefore, all endpoints have been evaluated based on 
accumulated data from the main and extension phase. 
In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of N8-GP from pivotal process and the commercial process, 
the subgroup analysis has been conducted including only those patients exposed to N8-GP from both 
processes. 
Protocol deviations 
Main and extension phase: A total of 284 important protocol deviations were identified prior to data base 
lock (01 -Sep-2017); none were on trial level, 2 were on country level (Germany and Turkey), 37 were at 
trial site level, and 245 were at patient level.

Table 47: Summary of important protocol deviations at patient level: 
Protocol deviations related to treatment compliance 
A total of 73 deviations were reported in this category. These deviations were mostly related to patient 
non-compliance with the prophylaxis dosing regimen, most of these cases were due to administration of 
the prophylaxis dose just outside the treatment window specified in the protocol, or due to discrepancies 
in dose size. The remaining protocol deviations were related to haemostatic effect evaluation, drug 
accountability, medication error and wrong DUN/dose administered to patients. 
Baseline data 
The trial population consisted of male patients with severe haemophilia A recruited from 36 sites in 15 
countries world-wide; of the 36 sites, 35 sites assigned patients to treatment. The majority of the patients 
were ‘White’ (80.9%) followed by ‘Asian’ (7.4%). The remaining part of the trial population was 
categorised either as ‘Black or African American’ (4.4%), ‘Other’ (2.9%), or not reported, i.e. ‘Not 
available’ (4.4%). 
At baseline, the patients in the 0–5 year age-group where characterised by a mean (range) age: 3.0 (1–
5) years, height: 99.3 (80.0–120) cm, and body weight: 16.1 (10.9–23.0) kg. For comparison, the 
patients in the 6–11 year age-group were of mean (range) age: 8.9 (6–11) years, height: 136 (111–161) 
cm, and body weight: 34.1 (17.0–60.4) kg. 
Haemophilia and treatment history 
Prior to enrolment in the trial, 65 (96%) of the patients were on prophylactic treatment (61 on rFVIII and 
4 on plasma-derived FVIII products). The remaining 3 (4%) patients were on on-demand treatment. For 
patients previously on prophylactic treatment (N=65), mean dose of the historic FVIII product was 33.7 
IU/kg and median ABR was 4.0. Previously on-demand patients (N=3) reported a mean dose of 23.3 
IU/kg and a median ABR of 12

•  2 patients due to ‘other’ reasons. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Details of bleeds 
Main phase 
A total of 70 bleeds were treated in 39 patients (57.4%) during the trial. The majority of the bleeds 
(71.4%) were traumatic, 27.1% were spontaneous bleeds, and a single bleed (1.4%) was due to minor 
surgery. The most frequent location of bleeds was in a joint, which accounted for 34 (i.e. 48.6%), divided 
in 10 joint bleeds in the 0-5 years age-group and 24 joint bleeds in the 6-11 year age-group. All bleeds 
were classified as mild or moderate, and no re-bleeds during the trial were reported. The mean (range) 
duration of bleeds among the 0-5 years age-group was 53.0 (0.4–209.6) hours compared to 35.2 (1.0–
136.2) hours in the 6-11 year age-group. Furthermore, the most frequently reported start time of a bleed 
was in the afternoon from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. 
Of the 15 patients who reported target joint at baseline, 11 patients did not report any target joint 
bleeding episodes during the trial. The remaining 4 patients reported 6 bleeding episodes involved a 
target joint, i.e. 2 bleeding episodes in the 0-5 year age-group (both spontaneous) and 4 bleeding

Main + extension phase 
A total of 282 bleeds were treated in 54 patients (79.4%) during the trial. The majority of the bleeds 
(66.3%) were traumatic, 32.6% were spontaneous bleeds, a single bleed (0.4%) was due to minor 
surgery and 2 causes of bleed were not known (0.7%). The most frequent location of bleeds was in a 
joint, which accounted for 143 (50.7%) of all bleeds with 35 joint bleeds in the 0−5 year age group and 
108 joint bleeds in the 6−11 year age group. All bleeds were classified as mild or moderate, except 2 
severe bleeds in the 0−5 year age group and 1 severe bleed in the 6−11 year age group. No re-bleeds 
were reported in both age groups. The mean (range) duration of bleeds in the 0−5 year age group was 
37.5 (0.3–209.6) hours compared to 33.8 (0.2–376.0) hours in the 6−11 year age group. Furthermore, 
the most frequently reported start time of a bleed was in the afternoon from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Table 56: Esperoct comparison –full analysis set 
Efficacy of Esperoct from the pivotal versus the commercial process 
During the development programme, the manufacturing of the Esperoct drug substance was moved to a 
new facility and the drug substance manufacturing process was optimised. Hereafter, ‘Eseproct from the 
pivotal process’ and ‘Esperoct from the commercial process’ are used to denominate products produced 
before and after these process changes, respectively. 
Out of the 68 exposed patients, 43 were initially exposed to Esperoct from the pivotal process and 
subsequently switched to N8-GP from the commercial process. These patients had 134 patient years of 
exposure with the N8-GP from the pivotal process and 26 patient years of exposure with the Esperoct 
from the commercial process. Results presented below are based on these 43 patients.  
No patients were withdrawn from the trial while on Esperoct from the commercial process. 
Incremental recovery 30 minutes post dose was similar for Esperoct from the pivotal and the commercial 
process. Haemostatic estimated success rate for Esperoct from the pivotal process was 80.9% and 88.9% 
for Esperoct from the commercial process. Estimated ABRs (Poisson estimate) with 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI) was 1.05 (0.75; 1.47) for Esperoct from the pivotal process and 0.70 (0.40; 1.21) for 
Esperoct from the commercial process. The overall Esperoct consumption per patient per year, the 
average prophylaxis dose and the average dose for treatment of bleeds were comparable for Esperoct 
from the pivotal and the commercial processes. Haemostatic response, ABR and Esperoct consumption 
data for Esperoct from the commercial process were consistent with those for Esperoct from the pivotal 
process.

Summary of main studies 
Table 57: Summary of efficacy for trial 3859 
Title:  A  Multi-national  Trial  Evaluating  Safety  and  Efficacy,  including  Pharmacokinetics,  of  NNC 
0129-0000-1003  when  administered  for  Treatment  and  Prophylaxis  of  Bleeding  in  Patients  with 
Haemophilia A - consisting of main phase, extension phase part 1 and interim results of extension phase 
part 2 
Study identifier 
NN7088-3859 
Design 
Hypothesis 
This was a multi-centre, multi-national, open-label trial. All patients were 
previously treated male patients (aged 12-66 years) with severe haemophilia A 
and at least 150 EDs to FVIII. The trial consisted of a main phase followed by an 
extension phase.  
The main phase included an on-demand arm (20−75 IU/kg) and a prophylaxis 
arm (50 IU/kg of N8-GP every 4th day). The treatment (on-demand or 
prophylaxis) was non-randomised and based on the choice of the patient and 
investigator. 
The extension phase of the trial includes two parts. In part 1, patients were 
offered the option of being randomised to treatment every 7 days (Q7D) or 
every 4 days (Q4D) (2:1 randomisation) if they were on Q4D prophylaxis with 
Esperoct in the main phase of the trial and had 0-2 bleeds during the last 6 
months before entering the extension phase. Patients with 3 or more bleeds 
within the last 6 months of the main phase and patients with low bleeding rates 
who were unwilling to be randomised continued on Q4D N8-GP. When patients 
had completed part 1 (6 months of treatment), extension phase part 2 was 
opened.  
In part 2, patients could continue on prophylaxis but could change between 
Q4D and Q7D dosing. The doses for the extension phase parts 1 and 2 were 50 
IU/kg of N8-GP for Q4D prophylaxis and 75 IU/kg of N8-GP for Q7D 
prophylaxis.  
Patients treated on demand throughout the main phase were to continue with 
the on-demand regimen in the extension phase.

Study identifier 
NN7088-3885 
Design 
This was a multi-national, open-label single-arm, and non-controlled trial to 
assess safety including immunogenicity, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
N8-GP. The trial product was given for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding 
episodes to patients below 12 years of age with severe haemophilia A who had 
>50 (0−5 year age group) or >150 (6−11 year age group) exposure days 
(EDs) with previous FVIII product.  
The trial consisted of a main phase and an extension phase. The duration of the 
main phase for each patient was approximately 26 weeks (corresponding to 50 
EDs). After completion of the main phase, the patients could continue in the 
extension phase lasting until N8-GP will become commercially available in the 
relevant countries or until the N8-GP programme is terminated, or otherwise 
required by national regulations.

Supportive study 
Study NN7088-3860: Efficacy and Safety of NNC 0129-0000-1003 (turoctocog alfa pegol) 
during Surgical Procedures in Patients with Haemophilia A 
The trial was a multi-centre, multi-national, open-label, non-randomised, single arm, efficacy and safety 
trial evaluating Esperoct during surgical procedures in patients with severe (FVIII:C<1%) haemophilia A. 
Patients enrolled in this trial were recruited from trial NN7088-3859 and only if they had received ≥ 5 
doses of Esperoct. Upon completion of this trial, patients returned to trial NN7088-3859, reentering the 
prophylactic or on-demand treatment arm as per their prior participation in the trial.

Figure 28: Trial design 
At screening, patients were given a 50 IU/kg dose of Esperoct to determine the dosing and intended FVIII 
activity levels for surgery. Prior to surgery (between visits 1 and 2), patients continued prophylaxis or 
on-demand treatment with Esperoct as in trial 3859 depending on which treatment regimen they were on 
prior to transferring into trial 3860. On the day of surgery (Day 0), all patients received a pre-operative 
dose of Esperoct, targeting a FVIII plasma level of ~80−100%. 
Patients were dosed during the post-operative period Days 1−6 to maintain FVIII plasma levels above 
50%. During post-operative Days 7−14, patients were dosed at the investigator’s discretion, considering 
WFH guidelines. Upon completion of this trial, patients returned to trial 3859, re-entering prophylactic or 
on-demand treatment as per their prior participation in the trial. If the investigator judged that a patient 
wasn’t ready to return to trial 3859, the post-operative period could be extended beyond Day 14. 
The primary endpoint in trial 3860 was haemostatic effect during surgery. Haemostatic response was 
assessed by the investigator/surgeon after the completion of surgery (defined as “last stitch”) using a 
pre-defined four-point scale.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints related to surgery are as follows: Estimated blood loss during surgery; 
Average consumption of Esperoct during surgery; Haemostatic effect of Esperoct during the 
post-operative period Days 1−6; Average consumption of Esperoct during the post-operative period Days 
1−6; Number of transfusions during the post-operative period Days 1−6; Haemostatic effect of Esperoct 
during the post-operative period Days 7−14.  
Summary of results: 
A total of 45 surgeries were performed in 33 patients. A total of 42 surgeries were reported as elective and 
the remaining 3 were reported as emergency surgeries. The vast majority of the surgeries were 
orthopaedic surgeries (41 surgeries). 
Haemostatic effect during surgery: The success rate for the haemostatic effect of Esperoct during surgery 
was 96% (43/45 surgeries rated ‘excellent’ or ‘good’). Two (2) surgeries (4%) had the effect rated as 
‘moderate’. All surgeries were conducted without change of treatment regimen. 
Post−surgical blood loss: The mean and median estimated blood loss following surgery was 339.4 mL and 
50.0 mL, respectively, ranging from 0 to 4520 mL.  
Blood transfusions: A total of 11 blood product transfusions were administered in 5 patients during or 
following 5 surgeries. Two (2) transfusions were given the day of surgery and 9 transfusions were given 
during post-surgery Days 1−6.  
Haemostatic effect of treatment of bleeds: Seven (7) bleeds were reported in the trial; 2 bleeds occurred 
before the surgery. The remaining 5 bleeds occurred during the post-operative period: 2 bleeds during 
Days 1−6, 2 bleeds during Days 7−14, and 1 bleed from Day 15. Of the post-operative bleeds, 4 occurred 
at the surgical site. Six (6) of the bleeds were successfully treated (rated ‘good’ or ‘excellent’) with N8-GP; 
1 bleed was missing a rating.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy data are derived from three clinical studies, i.e. pivotal trial 3859 in adults and adolescents (main 
part and two extension phases), trial 3885 in the paediatric population (main part and one extension 
phase) as well as the surgery trial 3860.  
During the course of the site inspections and the sponsor inspection, significant deficiencies in relation to 
data quality and integrity as well as rights and safety of patients were observed. Considering the observed 
deficiencies, a triggered inspection at additional two investigator sites has been requested, to complete 
the verification of the data integrity and the impact of these findings on the study.  According to the final 
integrated inspection report and despite of the ICH GCP breaches reported, the data is considered reliable 
enough to support the application submitted for Esperoct.  
All trials were open-label, multicentre trials which is considered acceptable for FVIII products. Numbers 
and characteristics of included patients are in line with GL requirements.  
Trial 3859 consisted of a main part (pivotal) followed by two extension phases. The main part of the trial 
included an on-demand arm and a prophylaxis arm. The starting regimen for prophylaxis was 50 IU/kg 
every 4 days (Q4D) which could be changed to twice weekly dosing. Results are however presented 
together for Q4D and twice weekly prophylaxis. No clear rationale was provided for such a change of 
regimen. During the course of the procedure the applicant argued that deviations from prophylactic 
dosing of one day are not considered important protocol deviations since they have no impact on overall 
data quality and patient safety. In terms of safety this argumentation is endorsed. However, in light of 
this argumentation the proposed wording in the SmPC which differentiates between a starting dose (50 
IU/kg every 4 days) and adjustment with a difference of one day (50 IU/kg every 3-4 days) is not 
understood. It is considered more meaningful to recommend both 50IU/kg every 4 days and every 3-4 
days as starting regimen and to leave it up to the patient whether fixed intervals or fixed days are 
preferred. Nevertheless, it was finally accepted to only include 50 IU/kg Q4D as starting regimen in the 
SmPC. 
 In the extension phase 1, patients fulfilling the criterion: “maximum 2 bleeding episodes during the last 
6 months” were offered to be randomized to once weekly regimen (75 IU/kg). Given the potential for 
Esperoct to eventually target less frequent prophylactic dosing on the individual patient level, it is in 
principle not evident why the sole alternative to the Q4D regimen is a strict Q7D regimen. Moreover, the 
applied switching criteria (low bleeding risk and willingness to be randomized) result in a selected patient 
set exposed to Q7D prophylaxis. In light of this selection issue, it is considered questionable that the 
estimated Q7D ABRs can serve as reliable basis to inform regulatory decision making concerning interval 
extensions above 3 days. Patients on Q7D prophylaxis with 2 spontaneous BEs or one severe BE requiring 
hospitalization within 8 weeks had to switch back to Q4D prophylaxis. During the extension phase 2, 
patients could switch between the two dosing regimens according to the described switching criteria. 
Concerning the question of whether the recommendations/rules tested in trial 3859 to switch to/from 
Q7D based on bleeding phenotype can be considered an informative starting point to eventually guide 
regimen prolongation decisions, no further insight was enabled by the answers provided. Prophylactic 
effect of Espeoct was to be concluded if the bleeding rate is significantly below 50% of the historical 
on-demand bleeding rate (i.e. significantly lower than 12) as well as within 25% of the historical 
prophylaxis bleeding rates (i.e. significantly lower than 6.8*1.25 = 8.5). The general assumption that any 
prophylactic treatment regimen achieving an ABR below 8.5 can be considered equally satisfactory is 
seen critical. In this context, a direct comparison of Q4D vs Q7D seems informative for decision making, 
and this was obviously also realised by the applicant, when foreseeing an estimation of the ABR-ratio 
(Q4D/Q7D) in the analysis plan. However, there was no further plan/discussion from the applicant’s side 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 108/144 
 
 
 
of whether any estimated increase of ABR after switch from Q4D to Q7D would be relevant, or a possibly 
acceptable trade-off from a patient perspective, having the advantage of less frequent dosing. Moreover, 
based on the applicant´s responses there remains the question whether a patient’s decision to prolong 
the dosing interval beyond 3 days could eventually impact actual lifestyle (e.g. amount of actual physical 
activity). Considering all these aspects, Section 4.2 of the SmPC provides recommendation of a 50IU/kg 
dose every 4 days as starting regimen. 
In the paediatric trial 3885 all patients received twice weekly prophylaxis with a dose of 60 U/kg. The 
treatment regimen could be changed to every 3 days based on the bleeding pattern of the patients. It was 
not foreseen to investigate treatment intervals beyond that.  
In both trials efficacy was evaluated in terms of ABR, haemostatic response (excellent, good, moderate, 
none), consumption of Esperoct per BE as well as during prophylaxis. Efficacy parameters are in line with 
the FVIII GL and are in principle considered acceptable. However, the definition of assessment categories 
for evaluation of haemostatic response was different to the widely accepted WFH criteria.  
In the surgery trial 3860 efficacy parameters as requested by the GL were gathered during this trial, i.e. 
efficacy of haemostasis, loss of blood and requirements for transfusion. However, the four-point-scale for 
clinical evaluation of haemostatic response during surgery (primary endpoint) is considered rather vague 
and is highly dependent on the investigators´/surgeons´ individual experience. Results should therefore 
be interpreted cautiously and should be assessed together with the results from more objective secondary 
endpoints.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The ABR in the main phase of trial 3859 (primary analysis) was 3.70 (2.94; 4.66) for Q4D and twice 
weekly prophylaxis. This is obviously below 8.5 which was the predefined threshold.  
In extension phase 1, 120 patients were eligible for randomization to either Q7D or Q4D prophylaxis. 
However, only 55 out of these 120 patients were willing to be randomized. The applicant did not provide 
any reasons why more than half of the patients refused randomization (and hence the option of an 
administration interval prolongation) as it was not foreseen to capture this information. According to the 
applicant the increased visit schedule associated with the randomization might be a major contributor to 
this or concerns in patients that they, due to the relatively lower factor coverage under Q7D, might not be 
able to maintain their current lifestyle, e.g., participate in sport activities.   
In extension phase 1, ABR for randomized patients was 1.77 (0.59; 5.32) for Q4D and 3.57 (2.13; 6.00) 
for once weekly prophylaxis resulting in a ratio of 2.02 (0.60; 6.80). Although the predefined threshold of 
an ABR below 8.5 was met under both regimens, the point estimate for ABR was about twice as high 
during once weekly prophylaxis on average. Given the rather low precision of the derived estimate for the 
ABR ratio, even the potential of a more than 6-fold increase of ABR could not be ruled out with certainty. 
Moreover, 9/38 patients in extension 1 and almost half of the patients, i.e. 23/52 patients in extension 2, 
respectively, switched back to Q4D prophylaxis. Overall, during the conduct of the study, 61 patients 
switched to Q7D prophylaxis of whom more than half of the patients (n=37) switched back to Q4D. Based 
on that fact, it is not considered acceptable to generally recommend once weekly prophylaxis in section 
4.2 of the SmPC.  
In the main phase of trial 3859 the majority of BEs was resolved with one, i.e. 338/436 (77.5%), or two 
injections, i.e. 70/436 (16.1%) in prophylaxis patients. Also in on-demand patients the majority of BEs 
was resolved with one, i.e. 471/532 (88.5%), or two injections, i.e. 45/532 (8.5%). These results are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 109/144 
 
 
 
 
generally in support of haemostatic efficacy of Esperoct. Results of the remaining endpoints are 
demonstrating favorable effects of Esperoct with regards to efficacy. 
In the paediatric trial 3885, ABR during the main phase was 1.94 (1.10; 3.42) in younger children and 
2.30 (1.40; 3.75) in older children and 2.13 (1.48; 3.06) in total. ABR during main phase and extension 
phase was 0.85 (0.49; 1.47) in younger children and 1.50 (1.03; 2.18) in older children and in total 1.20 
(0.88; 1.64).  
The majority of BEs was resolved with one injection, i.e. 18/30 (60%) in younger children and 26/40 
(65.0%) in older children and 44/70 (62.9%) in total; or two injections, i.e. 5/30 (16.7%) in younger 
children and 7/40 (17.5%) in older children and 12/70 (17.1%) in total. Results from the combined main 
and extension phase 1 analysis were found to be similar. 
The FVIII GL asks for data from a minimum of 5 patients undergoing at least 10 major surgeries which is 
fulfilled by the submitted interim study report of trial 3860. Overall, results are acknowledged and no 
specific concerns are raised in light of the dosing recommendations in the proposed SmPC. There are no 
concerns regarding efficacy of Esperoct when used perioperative mainly based on assessment of the 
secondary endpoints as these are considered more reliable than the favorable results from the primary 
endpoint which is considered to be influenced by individual surgeon´s experience.  
Of note, during extension phase 2 of trial 3859 and extension phase 1 of trial 3885 a small number of 
patients were switched from pivotal to commercial product. The limited data do not allow for a thorough 
comparison of the manufacturing processes on a clinical level. However, as there are data from a 
comprehensive comparability programme on a quality and nonclinical level which do not reveal any 
differences which might have an impact on efficacy and/or safety, this is considered acceptable.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, Esperoct was demonstrated to be efficacious in preventing and treating bleeding episodes in 
patients suffering from severe haemophilia A. However, the general recommendation of Q7D prophylaxis 
is not justified by data. Therefore, section 4.2 of the SmPC provides recommendation of a 50IU/kg dose 
every 4 days as starting regimen.

Table 61: Exposure days to Esperoct by duration intervals and age group – trials 3776, 3859, 
4033 and 3885- safety analysis set 
A total of 270 unique previously treated patients have been exposed to Esperoct in the clinical trials 3776, 
3859, 4033 and 3885. The patients have been exposed for a total of 79,446 exposure days, 
corresponding to a total of 882 PYE. As many patients participated in more than one trial, the sum of 
patients in the individual trials is higher than the total number of unique patients; 
The guideline requirements for FVIII products state that clinical efficacy of factor VIII treatment (e.g. 
prophylaxis, on demand) should be assessed during a period of a minimum of 50 exposure days by the 
patients themselves and treating physicians. No analysis regarding exposure days per patient could be 
identified in the safety dossier. However tables below reveal that most patients in the multiple dose trials 
were exposed considerably longer. Table 62 suggests that only 29 patients had less than 50 exposure 
days, 26 of which were however enrolled in the Phase 1 single dose study 3776. Through the N8-GP 
clinical development programme, 201 patients have been exposed for more than 2 years, 192 patients 
have been exposed for more than 3 years, 139 patients have been exposed for more than 4 years and 18 
patients (no children) have been exposed for more than 5 years.

Adverse events 
Table 63: overview of adverse events by treatment type – trials 3776, 3859, 4033 and 3885 
Adverse events appeared frequently in 88.5% of patients with an incidence of 2.62 events per patient 
year.  
Serious adverse events were noted with an incidence of 17.4% with an incidence of 0.08 per patient year. 
Most events non surprisingly occurred during prophylactic administration since exposure was highest for 
this group. 40 patients (14.8%) experienced adverse events that were considered to be treatment related 
with an incidence of 0.1 events per patient year of exposure.

Table 64: Overview of adverse events by age group – trials 3776, 4033 and 3885 
Looking at general incidences of adverse events by age group incidences were higher in children and 
adolescent patients, as compared to patients >=18y. This is also true when looking at the exposure 
adjusted data (3.30 events per py, (0‒5 years), 2.60 (6‒11 years) 3.64(12-17y) and 2.35 (≥ 18 years)). 
Interestingly within the remit of the paediatric population, adolescents of 12-17 years of age exhibit the 
highest incidence rates of adverse events. Differences seem e.g. be driven by mild infections which are 
not considered to be treatment related.

Table 65: Summary of most frequent adverse events (preferred term > 5%) – trials 3776, 
3859, 4033 and 3885 
The most commonly reported adverse events were viral upper respiratory tract infection (130 events in 
78 [29%] patients), upper respiratory tract infection (105 events in 57 [21%] patients), headache (118 
events in 56 [21%] patients), arthralgia (66 events in 43 [16%] patients), cough (53 events in 37 [14%] 
patients), diarrhoea (39 events in 31 [12%] patients) and influenza (42 events in 29 [11%] patients).  
The majority of the adverse events (88%) were non-serious. 66 adverse events in 42 (16%) patients 
were rated as severe.  Four (4) severe adverse events were judged as possibly or probably related to 
Esperoct by the investigator (intervertebral discitis and hypersensitivity [serious adverse events] and 
gastritis and muscle haemorrhage [non-serious adverse events]), while the remaining severe adverse 
events were judged as unlikely related to Esperoct (see serious adverse events and deaths). 
A total of 84 adverse events in 40 (15%) patients were evaluated by the investigator as possibly or 
probably related to Esperoct corresponding to a rate of 0.10 events per PYE. The majority of the events 
judged as possibly or probably related to Esperoct were non-serious, of mild or moderate severity and the 
majority of the patients recovered from their events.  
Most “treatment related adverse events” occurred in the SOC “Investigations” (14( 5.2%);0.04 
events/py)).  The most frequently reported events were aspartate aminotransferase increased (7 events 
in 6 patients(2.2%), alanine aminotransferase increased (5 events in 4 patients, 1.5%), headache (4 
events in 4 patients, 1.5%), rash (6 events in 3 patients 1.1%), arthralgia (3 events in 3 patients 1.1%), 
gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2 events in 2 patients 0.7%) and dizziness (2 events in 2 
patients, 0.7%). All other events judged as possibly or probably related to N8-GP by the investigator were 
reported as single events across different system organ classes or as few events of the same preferred 
term in 1 patient.

Generally spoken, the adverse event pattern is consistent with what is known from the patient population 
as well as FVIII treatment. The rather high incidence of increased liver enzymes is partly explained by the 
high incidence of Hepatitis C patients in the investigated population (44%). 
Common adverse events – surgery trial 3860 
A total of 118 adverse events were reported in 37 (77%) surgeries; 5 of the events were serious. The vast 
majority of the events by preferred term occurred once or twice. The most commonly reported adverse 
events were constipation (11 events in 11 [23%] surgeries) and nausea (6 events in 6 [13%] surgeries); 
none of these events were judged to be related to N8-GP by the investigator. 
A total of 19 adverse events in 5 (10%) surgeries were judged to be possibly or probably related to 
Esperoct by the investigator. The majority of these events (17 out of 19 events) were non-serious adverse 
events, and the outcome of the events was stated as recovered or recovering (18 events) or recovered 
with sequelae (1 event). The majority of the adverse events were evaluated of mild or moderate severity. 
No FVIII inhibitors and no thromboembolic events were reported.   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
One (1) death was reported in the Esperoct clinical trials: 
•  A fatal event of ‘pancreatic carcinoma metastatic’ was reported in a 67-year-old patient (patient ID 
255001; trial 3859). The event was reported after 88 days of exposure to Esperoct. The patient 
complained of unexplained weight loss of 10 kg during the past few months and abdominal pain 
leading to hospitalisation due to suspicion of malignant tumour. Findings were compatible with a liver 
metastasis of a pancreatic cancer or with a cholangiocellular carcinoma. The patient started 
treatment with chemotherapy (gemcitabine). Approximately 6 months later, the patient came to the 
emergency room due to haematemesis. 
Serious adverse events 
Table 66: Serious adverse events possibly or probably related to Esperoct as judged by the 
investigator – trials 3776, 3859, 4033 and 3885 
A total of 67 serious adverse events were recorded in 47 (17%) patients, corresponding to a rate of 0.08 
serious adverse events per PYE. The number of serious adverse events per se seems rather on the higher 
end of what is known from other factor VIII products however still within the remit of what is described. 
The serious adverse events were mostly recorded as single events and across different system organ 
classes. The serious adverse events occurred after 2–363 exposure days of Esperoct, and no association 
between frequency of the events and exposure time was observed. Of the 67 serious adverse events, 4 
events were judged as possibly or probably related to Esperoct by the investigator (intervertebral discitis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019

FVIII inhibition, hypersensitivity and haemorrhage). The remaining serious adverse events were judged 
as unlikely related to Esperoct by the investigator. The events of FVIII inhibition and hypersensitivity are 
further described in “Immunological events”. In addition to the events judged as treatment related one 
serious case of cerebral infarction and one serious case of cerebral microhemorrhage were identified in 
one adult patient (patient ID 7010021; trial 3859) 
The majority of the patients had recovered from their serious adverse events at the cut-off date, while 1 
event had a fatal outcome (see deaths) and 11 events had an outcome stated as ‘not recovered’. 
Surgery trial 3860 
Data from this trial revealed 5 serious adverse events were recorded in 4 (8.3%) surgeries. Two of the 
serious adverse events (haemorrhage and ischemia) were judged as possibly related to Esperoct by the 
investigator. These 2 events were reported in the same patient while undergoing a total knee 
replacement. It is agreed that dose events are potentially treatment related. Their occurrence in one 
patient during a knee replacement is of interest, since this is a commonly performed surgical procedure in 
haemophilia A patients, however this single case does not indicate a trend of lack of efficacy during 
surgery. 
Events of special Interest: 
Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity 
Table 67: Allergic reactions possibly or probably related to Esperoct as judged by the 
investigator – identified in broad NNMQ search 
Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis are known class effects and have been reported for marketed 
FVIII products. The company underwent a broad scope NNMQ search ‘allergic-type hypersensitivity 
reactions’ in order to ensure that all events were captured. 
A total of 217 adverse events in 105 (39%) patients were identified in the broad search for allergic 
reactions, which indicates the high relevance of allergic reactions in the patient population. The most 
frequently reported events by preferred term were cough (53 events in 37 [14%] patients), eczema (19 
events in 15 [5.6%] patients), seasonal allergy (19 events in 14 [5.2%] patients) and rash (18 events in 
14 [5.2%] patients). 
The majority of the 217 adverse events identified in the search were non-serious, of mild or moderate 
severity and judged as unlikely related to Esperoct by the investigator. Three adverse events were judged 
of severe severity and 2 of these events were reported as serious adverse events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 117/144 
 
 
 
 
Two (2) serious adverse events were reported: 1 event of hypersensitivity judged as probably related to 
Esperoct, and 1 event of circulatory collapse judged as unlikely related to Esperoct by the investigator: 
•  A 3-year-old patient (trial 3885) had an event of hypersensitivity reported as a serious adverse 
event. The patient was withdrawn from the trial as he met the withdrawal criterion 
‘allergy/anaphylaxis related to trial product’. The patient developed a mild type 1 allergic reaction 
after the first Esperoct dose and later a severe allergic reaction after the fourth Esperoct dose. 
Neither the mild, nor the severe allergic reaction required any treatment or systemic intervention 
and the clinical symptoms resolved after 2 hours. The patient had received Esperoct for a total of 4 
exposure days at the time of withdrawal. Other than low titre pre-existing antibodies to PEG, which 
decreased in titre over time, no antibodies of IgM, IgG or IgE isotypes directed against Esperoct or 
CHO HCP were detected. IgE antibodies to PEG were not detected. Subsequently the patient showed 
a similar reaction pattern after switching treatment to another non-PEGylated rFVIII product 
indicating that PEG was not the inducing factor. The second injection with the FVIII product was 
accompanied with vomiting similar to what led to the patient's withdrawal from Esperoct. The 
investigator could not exclude gastrointestinal disorder. At the last follow-up, the patient was still on 
the same FVIII product with 1–3 times weekly home injections and has had multiple injections after 
the withdrawal from the trial. 
•  A 24-year-old patient (trial 3859) had an event of circulatory collapse reported as a serious adverse 
event which was described by the investigator as a “circulatory collapse relating to injection of 'resin 
bomb' of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)". The event was judged as unlikely related to 
Esperoct by the investigator. 
A total of 13 adverse events in 7 patients were judged as possibly or probably related to Esperoct by the 
investigator; all non-serious and of mild or moderate severity, except 1 serious adverse event of severe 
hypersensitivity (described above). 5 events in 2 patients were reported as medical events of special 
interest by the investigator. 
In general the scope of adverse events linked to allergic reactions has been reasonably described and 
does not give rise to concern, that Esperoct would perform differently regarding this risk, than other FVIII 
products (see also immunologic events). 
Thromboembolic events 
The risk of thrombotic complications with high purity FVIII products, such as Esperoct is judged to be low. 
In all clinical trials with Esperoct, thromboembolic events were to be reported as medical events of special 
interest. In order to ensure that all events were captured, an SMQ search of “embolic and thrombotic 
events” was performed. 
One (1) suspected thromboembolic event was reported: 
•  A 51-year old patient (trial 3859) had a serious adverse event of “suspicion of cranial micro 
infarction” following cranial magnetic resonance imaging (coded to preferred term ‘cerebral 
infarction’). However, there was no definitive diagnosis and relationship to Esperoct was recorded as 
unlikely by the investigator and by Novo Nordisk. The event was recorded following 168 exposure 
days with Esperoct. The patient continued treatment with Esperoct. The outcome of the adverse 
event was stated as ‘not recovered’. Concurrently, a suspected cerebral microhaemorrhage was 
reported for the patient. The investigator reported the underlying disease (haemophilia), vasculitis, 
and post infection as alternative aetiologies for the 2 events cerebral microhaemorrhage and 
cerebral infarction.

Medication errors 
A total of 6 medication errors were identified in 6 patients and comprised product preparation error, 
overdose and accidental overdose reported in trial 3859 and accidental overdose, drug administration 
error and medication error reported in trial 3885. All medication errors were rated as mild and the 
outcome was stated as recovered. No associated adverse events were reported with any of the 
medication errors. The overall number of medication error seems low considering the total number of 
exposure days. Esperoct is hence not considered to cause a high potential for medication error. 
Suspected transmission of infectious agents via trial product 
There were no events of suspected transmission of an infectious agent via trial product in any of the 
Esperoct clinical trials. 
Injection site reactions 
A total of 7 adverse events concerning injection site reactions were identified in 7 patients. The events 
were reported as infusion site reaction, injection site reaction, injection site erythema, injection site rash, 
vessel puncture site haematoma and vessel puncture site pain (trial 3859) and injection site swelling (trial 
3885). All the events were of mild or moderate severity and all patients recovered from the events. Two 
(2) of the events (injection site reaction in trial 3859 and injection site swelling in trial 3885) were judged 
by the investigator as possibly or probably related to Esperoct. It seems debatable how an injection site 
reaction should not be related to the application of Esperoct, however their overall number regarding 
cumulative exposure seems low enough and no severe cases were identified, hence this is not considered 
a major risk.  
Drug-related hepatic disorders 
An SMQ search of “drug-related hepatic disorders” was performed by the applicant. In the Esperoct 
clinical development programme, a total of 120 (44%) patients were hepatitis C positive at baseline Six 
(2%) patients were hepatitis B positive at baseline and half of them were also hepatitis C positive. A total 
of 74 adverse events in 34 (13%) patients were identified in the SMQ search. The majority (22/34) of 
these patients were positive for hepatitis C and/or hepatitis B at baseline, which is a likely contributor to 
the occurrence of such events. As stated by the applicant, only 20 events were judged as possibly or 
probably related to Esperoct by the investigator; all were non-serious and of mild (19 events) or 
moderate (1 event) severity, and the majority of the events had the outcome stated as recovered.   
Renal disorders 
A total of 6 adverse events concerning renal disorders were reported in 4 (1.5%) patients. 
Three (3) patients had 5 adverse events of blood creatinine increased; all 5 events were judged as 
unlikely related to Esperoct by the investigator, were non-serious, of mild or moderate severity, and had 
the outcome stated as recovered. One serious adverse event (tubulointerstitial nephritis) was identified in 
trial 3859, caused gram-negative rod septicaemia.  
Safety assessment related to PEG 
Special focus of the safety assessment is laid upon safety signals related to the 40kDa PEG moiety that is 
attached to the rFVIII. PEGylation, in general, is a well-established technique commonly used to prolong 
the circulating half-life of drugs. PEG is widely used in food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 
(either as excipient or conjugated to the active drug). As a large number of PEGylated products have been

approved or are currently in development, the nonclinical profile of PEG has been extensively 
characterised. 
Published data from long-term nonclinical studies with other PEGylated proteins have shown vacuolation 
in macrophages and in cells of excretory organs like the kidney, liver and choroid plexus (Ivens IA, et al. 
PEGylated Biopharmaceuticals: Current Experience and Considerations for Nonclinical Development. 
Toxicol Pathol. 2015;43(7):959-83/EPARs of other pegylated products). The presence of PEG-related 
vacuoles did not result in any cellular reaction (e.g., no inflammation, degeneration or necrosis) and was 
not associated with adversity or in vivo functional changes in the animals. Published literature reviews 
conclude that at clinically relevant doses, PEG is inert and there are no functional changes or changes with 
toxicological relevance (E.g. European Medicines Agency. CHMP Safety Working Party’s response to the 
PDCO regarding the use of PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012). 16 Nov 2012/ Ivens et al. Haemophilia. 2013;19(1):11-20/Stidl et.al., 
Haemophilia. 2016;22(1):54-64). The therapeutic protein to which PEG is conjugated is likely to exert all 
pharmacological and toxicological effects, with little or no additive effect of PEG other than those arising 
from extended systemic efficacy. 
However this matter constitutes a persistent uncertainty, since haemophilia A patients currently need a 
life long substitution with their factor products which represents an exposure with PEG that has not been 
simulated in a preclinical and clinical model. It is well conceivable that accumulation of PEG happens over 
time and only becomes symptomatic after a certain threshold/exposure time is reached. 
This uncertainty is especially serious for children and adolescents <12years whose cerebral development 
is not finished and which should therefore currently not be treated with Esperoct, since this could be 
associated with currently unknown long term-sequelae.  
Concerning accumulation of the PEG moiety, safety signals that could potentially arise from exposure to 
the 40 kDa PEG moiety of N8-GP have had special focus in the safety assessment of Esperoct and have 
been investigated in both nonclinical and clinical studies. The attention has been to identify adverse 
findings that, theoretically, could be related to the function of the kidney, liver and choroid plexus. This 
choice can in general be followed based on available nonclinical evidence of vacuolation in macrophages 
and in cells of excretory organs like the kidney, liver and choroid plexus. 
On preclinical level no signs for PEG accumulation were detected (see non-clinical development). 
However no IHC for kidney and hepatic tissue was performed in tox. studies.  
Concerning clinical findings the most frequently reported event by preferred term in the system organ 
class “nervous system disorders” was headache; 118 events in 56 (21%) patients. Details of all adverse 
events of headache displayed over time in clinical trials with long-term exposure to Esperoct (trials 3859, 
4033 and 3885) are provided in the following figure.

Figure 29: Adverse events over time – headache – trials 3859, 4033 and 3885 analysis set 
All adverse events of headache were non-serious and of mild or moderate severity. Overall, the duration 
of the events was short even though some patients reported several adverse events of headache.  
While the incidence of headache per se does not increase over time, five subjects in the pooled dataset 
seemed to have episodes of mild headache with a rather late onset in their exposure (more than 2 years) 
that stretched over months and even years, which is considered unusual. 
The applicant clarified, that the observed matter was rather a question of reporting practice. Due to 
longer intervals between visits, headaches were displayed as continuous, when individual data suggests 
that they were rather “occasional”. Neurologic exams of the nine patients in question were unremarkable 
and no plasma total PEG levels that were abnormally high (compared to the rest of the study population 
after comparable treatment duration) were identified. 
All other events within the system organ classes “nervous system disorders” and “psychiatric disorders” 
were reported across different preferred terms and reported in few patients (see also adverse events).

Safety of Esperoct by production method 
Table 69: Overview of adverse events by production method – trials 3859 and 3885 
Single dose safety of Esperoct from 2 processes (pivotal and commercial) was assessed in trial 4033. In 
this trial, no patients developed FVIII inhibitors, and no safety signals were observed based on antibodies, 
adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory results. Safety of Esperoct following 
multiple dosing of Esperoct from the commercial process versus Esperoct from the pivotal process was 
assessed in the phase 3 trials in adults and adolescents (trial 3859) and in children (trial 3885). At the 
data cut-off date, 92 out of 254 patients in these two trials have been switched to the Esperoct from the 
commercial process. The total number of exposure days was considerably higher with Esperoct from the 
pivotal process (74,076) compared to the commercial process (5217). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 122/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No new trend in the safety profile was seen following administration of Esperoct from the commercial 
process in the phase 3 trials. The assessment was based on adverse events, serious adverse events, 
deaths and antibodies. 
The type of adverse events was comparable for Esperoct from the two processes. No deaths, no FVIII 
inhibitor development and no severe allergic reactions were reported following administration of Esperoct 
from the commercial process. Furthermore, there were no signs of an increased incidence with respect to 
development of anti-N8-GP antibodies, anti-PEG antibodies or anti-CHO HCP antibodies. 
Preclinical and quality assessment are not suggestive of a meaningful difference concerning the two 
processes, which is a key finding, since too few patients were exposed for a too short exposure to 
establish clinical B/R for the commercial process alone. However, considering the fact, that extrapolation 
between both processes can be granted, the subset of patients studied with the commercial process does 
not reveal signs suggesting a worse safety profile than the pivotal process. On the contrary, general 
incidences in safety signals show trends towards a better safety profile, which might however be 
deceiving, since patients switched to the commercial product are in most cases those, that tolerated 
Esperoct best. The more relevant comparison would probably have been to the subgroup of patients with 
a comparable exposure duration, that was not switched to the commercial product. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Standard haematology parameters were assessed in all the clinical trials. No clinically relevant 
abnormalities were apparent in any of the trials. AEs were rare, most notable is a single case of inhibitor 
development in the pivotal trial 3859 (see also immunologic events). 
In the surgery trial 3860, there was an expected post-operative decrease in mean RBC count, 
haemoglobin and haematocrit and an increase in platelets at end-of-trial compared to baseline. 
There were also variations in other haematology parameters during and after surgery, which resolved 
according to the applicant.  
Biochemistry 
Standard biochemistry parameters were assessed in all the clinical trials. Overall, no clinically relevant 
changes in adverse events associated with exposure to Esperoct have been observed for biochemistry 
parameters.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 123/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of hepatic and renal laboratory parameters had special attention in the safety assessment of 
Esperoct as outlined above (safety assessment related to PEG). 
Several patients had elevated hepatic enzymes, which can in part be attributed to the high incidence of 
hepatitis C among the study population. 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated in connection with safety assessment related to PEG. 
No safety concern was identified. Adverse events of increased blood creatinine were reported in 3 
patients.  
In the surgery trial 3860 there were, as expected, some post-operative variations in the biochemistry 
parameters; these had generally returned to baseline-values at the end-of-trial.  
Coagulation-related parameters 
Coagulation-related parameters were assessed in all trials, except trials 3885 and 4033. 
As expected, a decrease in aPTT was observed after Esperoct administration in all trials. No other clinically 
relevant changes were observed in coagulation-related parameters. 
Table 70: Exposure to Esperoct by trial, age group and production method – trials 3859 and 
3885 
Elderly 
In the trials overall, there were only 3 patients ≥65 years of age. The safety of Esperoct could therefore 
not be analysed separately in a meaningful matter beyond description of the single cases. Out of 26 
adverse events reported in these 3 patients, 1 event was a serious adverse event; this was the fatal event 
of pancreatic carcinoma metastatic. The subgroup of elderly patients is too small to deduce whether their 
safety profile is different from other patients. 
Children/Adolescents 
Looking at general incidences of adverse events by age group (see also “Adverse events”) incidences 
were higher in children and adolescent patients, as compared to patients >=18y. This is also true when 
looking at the exposure adjusted data (3.30 events per py, (0‒5 years), 2.60 (6‒11 years) 3.64(12-17y)  
and 2.35 (≥ 18 years)). Interestingly within the remit of the paediatric population, adolescents of 12-17 
years of age exhibit the highest incidence rates of adverse events. The “disadvantage” of younger 
patients seems to diminish when looking at severe, serious and potentially treatment related AEs. 
Differences seem e.g. be driven by mild infections which are not considered to be treatment related. Six 
(6) patients were below 2 years of age at the time of inclusion in trial. At the data cut-off date, the number 
of exposure days with Esperoct for these patients ranged from 337 to 391 exposure days. Out of 53 
adverse events reported in these 6 patients, 2 events were reported as serious adverse events: 1 event 
of fall and 1 event of sepsis syndrome. Both events were judged as unlikely related to Esperoct by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019

investigator and both patients recovered from the events. A total of 4 adverse events in 2 patients were 
judged as possibly or probably related to Esperoct by the investigator; post procedural complication in 1 
patient and 3 events of rash. Both patients recovered from the events. Again besides long exposure days 
the number of patients below 2 years of age is considered too small to exclude a different safety profile 
exists for those patients, however, existing data does not give particular rise of concern. 
Safety in PUPs 
The applicant presented data of the ongoing trial 3908, that includes previously untreated patients below 
6 years of age, with no prior use of purified FVIII containing clotting products (5 previous exposure days 
to blood components are acceptable). As of the data cut-off date in trial 3908, 32 previously untreated 
patients were exposed to Esperoct for a total of 2901 exposure days (ranging from 1 to 354 exposure 
days per patient).  
A total of 14 serious adverse events were reported in 9 patients. 
Four (4) patients have developed FVIII inhibitors; 1 patient had a high peak titre of 6.1 BU and 3 patients 
had low peak titre of 1.0, 1.6 and 4.9 BU, respectively. One (1) of the FVIII inhibitor patients (4.9 BU) was 
withdrawn due to the patient’s withdrawal of consent. The other 3 patients continued in the trial. In 
addition, 1 patient had a single positive FVIII inhibitor test taken at a local laboratory showing at titre of 
1.0 BU. However, a central laboratory test taken shortly after in this patient was negative. 
In general, the fact, that previously untreated patients develop FVIII inhibitors is very common, and the 
observed incidence of 5/32 patients (three with low peak titre, one borderline case and one with high peak 
titre) developing inhibitors at some point of the study seems within the range of observed incidences of 
FVIII treatment.  
Other serious adverse events reported in this trial comprised single events of head injury, therapy 
non-responder, spinal epidural haematoma, tongue injury and contusion, and 3 events of pneumonia in 
1 patient, who also had 1 event of pneumonia haemophilus. All serious adverse events were judged as 
unlikely related to Esperoct by the investigator, except the event of therapy non-responder which was 
judged as probably related to Esperoct by the investigator. The adverse event of therapy non-responder 
was reported in a patient who experienced excessive bleeding after a planned central venous access 
device implantation. He was treated with bypassing agents. He was withdrawn due to lack of efficacy after 
a total of 14 exposure days to Esperoct. At the end of the trial visit, the patient was FVIII inhibitor 
negative but tested positive for anti-N8-GP antibodies. 
Immunological events 
Clinical Immunogenicity 
FVIII inhibitors 
All patients were tested for FVIII inhibitors and all detections of FVIII inhibitors were to be recorded as 
adverse events and medical events of special interest. One positive case was identified in trial 3859 in an 
18-year-old previously treated patient on prophylactic treatment with Esperoct. After 93 exposure days to 
Esperoct a FVIII inhibitor test was positive for the first time with an observed titre of 1.3 BU. The result 
was confirmed in the follow-up test 14 days later (1.9 BU). 
Hence, the protocol definition for the presence of a FVIII inhibitor was met (two positive tests ≥0.6BU). As 
a low-titre inhibitor was detected with no indication of clinical impact, it was decided that the patient could 
continue in the trial, as per local amendment. Approximately 2.5 months later, the FVIII inhibitor titre 
increased to 13.5 BU, and the patient was withdrawn from the trial. According to the applicant the patient 
responded well to prophylactic treatment throughout the trial. After withdrawal from the trial, the patient 
was treated with a rFVIIa product for treatment of bleeding episodes. The FVIII inhibitors had 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 125/144 
 
 
 
 
 
disappeared 5 months after the withdrawal from the trial, and thereafter the patient returned to his 
previous FVIII product. The patient has not developed recurrent FVIII inhibitors after the withdrawal from 
the trial and until cut-off date for this application (approximately 3.5 years). 
The 1 event of confirmed FVIII inhibitors in the Esperoct clinical trials in previously treated patients 
resulted in an estimated rate of inhibitors of 0.4% and a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit for the 
inhibitor rate of 2.3%) (n=235 patients). In study 3859 itself the 97.5% upper confidence limit for the 
inhibitor rate was 3.8% with was contained in the pre-defined upper limit of 6.8% (n=155 at risk 
=>50ED).  
The incidence of inhibitor formation in PTPs for FVIII products is usually stated as “uncommon” which 
means frequencies range from 1/1000 to 1/10000. This means for study 3859, there is a reasonable 
chance for the occurrence of inhibitors to occur in this trial (≈1.5%-14%) if inhibitor formation is truly 
“uncommon” for Esperoct treated patients. Precision of inhibitor incidence is low, leaving some 
uncertainty of whether the single observed case could be indicative of higher frequencies which would be 
not compatible with the ‘uncommon’ category. 
In trial 3885 in pediatric patients two positive tests for FVIII inhibitors were noted. Those could however 
not be confirmed in a second test, nor in any later tests and are hence per protocol not considered true 
positive cases. One of the two cases however, an 11 year old patient tested positive for anti-N8-GP 
antibodies at all visits and had two positive tests for lupus coagulant after the positive inhibitor test. 
Of the 32 previously untreated patients exposed to Esperoct in the ongoing trial 3908, 4 patients had 
developed FVIII inhibitors (1 high-titre, one borderline high titre, and 2 low-titre FVIII inhibitors). In 
addition one patient had a single positive, non-confirmed test. 
In summary, the observed occurrence of a positive inhibitor case is not considered a strong indicator of a 
higher incidence of FVIII inhibitor formation under Esperoct treatment as compared to other FVIII 
products. The incidence of FVIII formation in previously untreated patients (to date 4/32 patients in the 
ongoing trial 3908) is considered in line with expected incidences in this population. 
Other antibodies 
Table 71: Overview of anti-drug antibody by trial – trials 3776, 3859, 3860, 4033 and 3885 –

Assessments of non-neutralising anti-N8-GP antibodies and anti-PEG antibodies were done in all clinical 
trials. Assessments of anti-CHO HCP antibodies were performed in all trials in cases of a severe 
allergic/anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, the protocols for trials 3859 and 3885 were amended to also 
include routine analysis of anti-CHO HCP antibodies using the blood samples drawn for anti-N8-GP

antibodies if the blood sample volume allowed; this was done in order to collect samples following the 
change in production facility and method of Esperoct drug substance. 
Anti-N8-GP antibodies were identified in 6 patients (trials 3859 and 3885), of which 2 were positive for 
anti-N8-GP antibodies prior to exposure to Esperoct. Four (4) patients developed anti-N8-GP antibodies 
after dosing with Esperoct. One (1) of these patients was the FVIII inhibitor patient, and the other 3 
patients were only transiently positive. 
The incremental recovery was only affected for 1 patient, and there were no relevant adverse events 
reported around the time of the positive results. Patients that underwent major surgery (trial 3860) were 
followed with close monitoring several months after surgery to assess potential development of inhibitors. 
None of these patients with intensified Esperoct therapy developed anti-N8-GP antibodies after the 
surgery. 
In total, 32 (12.6%) of the patients in trials 3859 and 3885 had pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies of which 
the age group from 0–5 years had the highest frequency (48.5%). During the trial programme, 11 
patients developed transient low-titre anti-PEG antibodies; 1 of these patients was positive for anti-PEG 
antibodies only at the last visit. A total of 20 patients of the 32 patients who had pre-existing anti-PEG 
antibodies did not have measurable anti-PEG antibodies post Esperoct administration. The incremental 
recovery was not affected by the anti-PEG antibodies, and there were no increase in bleed frequency or 
relevant adverse events reported around the time of the positive results. In addition, there were no 
apparent differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles between the patients who were anti-PEG antibody 
positive and those who were negative. None of the patients who underwent major surgery developed 
anti-PEG antibodies after the surgery. 
Anti-CHO HCP antibodies were identified in 11 patients (trials 3859 and 3885), of which 2 were positive 
prior to exposure to Esperoct. Nine (9) patients developed low-titre anti-CHO HCP antibodies. Of the 9 
patients, 3 had persistent anti-CHO HCP antibodies. No relevant adverse events were reported around the 
time of the positive anti-CHO HCP antibody tests. None of the patients who underwent major surgery 
developed anti-CHO HCP antibodies after the surgery (trial 3860). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been performed and no interactions of Esperoct with other medicinal 
products have been reported.

Table 72: Adverse events leading to withdrawal – trials 3776, 3859, 4033 and 3885 
Five (5) patients were withdrawn from trial 3859 and 2 patients were withdrawn from trial 3885 due to 
adverse events; In addition, 2 patients were withdrawn because they met a withdrawal criterion related 
to safety; 1 patient in trial 3859 was withdrawn because he met the withdrawal criterion ‘FVIII inhibitor 
(>5 BU) as confirmed by re-testing by the central laboratory’ and 1 patient in trial 3885 was withdrawn 
because he met the withdrawal criterion ‘allergy/anaphylaxis related to trial product’. 
Six (6) of the 7 adverse events leading to withdrawal were serious adverse events. One (1) adverse event 
(haemorrhage; trial 3885) was judged by the investigator to be probably related to Esperoct, while the 
remaining events were judged to be unlikely related to Esperoct. Furthermore, for the 2 patients who 
were withdrawn due to withdrawal criteria related to safety, the adverse events were judged by the 
investigator to be probably related to Esperoct administration: FVIII inhibition and hypersensitivity. 
While serious adverse events and events of special interest are discussed in their respective sections, the 
overall number of discontinuations due to adverse events is low considering the long duration of both 
studies (9 (nine) including 2 (two) patients who met withdrawal criteria (high titre FVIII inhibition and 
hypersensitivity). No currently unknown risk for FVIII treatment is deduced from this finding. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The clinical development program of Esperoct is in accordance with the current GL on the clinical 
investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived FVIII products. In clinical development quite 
long exposure times to Esperoct were reached. Out of a total of 270 patients treated, 192 patients 
(including 63 children) were treated for more than 3 years, 139 patients (including 15 children) were 
treated for more than 4 years and 18 patients (no children) were treated for more than 5 years. 
Adverse Events/Deaths 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 128/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most “treatment related adverse events” occurred in the SOC “Investigations” (14(5.2%);0.04 
events/py)). The most common adverse events for Esperoct are rash, erythema, pruritus and injection 
site reactions. 
The most frequently reported events were aspartate aminotransferase increased (7 events in 6 patients, 
2.2%), alanine aminotransferase increased (5 events in 4 patients, 1.5%), headache (4 events in 4 
patients, 1.5%), rash (6 events in 3 patients 1.1%) and arthralgia (3 events in 3 patients 1.1%). 
The adverse event pattern is in general considered consistent with the patient population as well as FVIII 
treatment. The relatively high occurrence of elevated liver enzymes is potentially associated with the high 
prevalence of hepatitis C in the safety analysis set (44%). 
One (1) fatal event of ‘pancreatic carcinoma metastatic’ was reported in a 67-year-old patient (trial 
3859). The investigators and the company considered the event unlikely to be related to Esperoct. 
4 serious adverse events were judged as possibly or probably related to Esperoct by the investigator 
(intervertebral discitis, FVIII inhibition, hypersensitivity and haemorrhage); In addition to the events 
judged as treatment related one serious case of cerebral infarction and one serious case of cerebral 
microhemorrhage were identified in one adult patient (trial 3859). The company discussed this case as 
not treatment related, it seems however, that the microbleedings could have been supported by not 
entirely managed haemophilia.  
Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis are known class effects and have been reported for marketed 
FVIII products. A total of 13 adverse events in 7 patients were judged as possibly or probably related to 
Esperoct by the investigator; all non-serious and of mild or moderate severity, except 1 serious adverse 
event of severe hypersensitivity that eventually resolved after cessation of treatment. 
A total of 7 adverse events concerning injection site reactions were identified in 7 patients. The events 
were reported as infusion site reaction, injection site reaction, injection site erythema, injection site rash, 
vessel puncture site haematoma and vessel puncture site pain (trial 3859) and injection site swelling (trial 
3885). All the events were of mild or moderate severity and all patients recovered from the events.  
Risks associated to long term exposure to PEG 
Special focus of the safety assessment is laid upon safety signals related to the 40kDa PEG moiety that is 
attached to the rFVIII. PEGylation, in general, is a well-established technique commonly used to prolong 
the circulating half-life of drugs. PEG is widely used in food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 
(either as excipient or conjugated to the active drug).  
Published data from long-term nonclinical studies with other PEGylated proteins have shown vacuolation 
in macrophages and in cells of excretory organs like the kidney, liver and choroid plexus (Ivens IA, et al. 
PEGylated Biopharmaceuticals: Current Experience and Considerations for Nonclinical Development. 
Toxicol Pathol. 2015;43(7):959-83; EPARs of other pegylated products). This matter constitutes a 
persistent uncertainty, since haemophilia A patients currently need a life long substitution with their 
factor products which represents an exposure to PEG that has not been simulated during the development 
of Esperoct in a preclinical and/or clinical model. It is well conceivable that accumulation of PEG happens 
over time and only becomes symptomatic after a certain threshold/exposure time (potentially after 
exposure times >5years) is reached. A potential accumulation of PEG moiety in the nervous system tissue 
or other human tissue as well as the potential clinical impact on brain development in children e.g. on 
cognitive, functional or metabolic properties, is therefore an unknown risk. Due to these reasons, the 
treatment of Esperoct in patients younger than 12 years represents an uncalculable risk and benefit risk 
in this population in this population is regarded negative.  
On preclinical level no signs for PEG accumulation were detected (see non-clinical development), however 
accumulation in liver and kidney was not analysed in chronic toxicity studies.  
Regarding the clinical development, no increase of potentially PEG associated events (nervous system, 
renal and hepatic disorders) was noted over time. Two findings, however, complemented the uncertainty 
associated with PEG during evaluation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 129/144 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Five subjects in the pooled dataset seemed to have episodes of mild headache with a rather late 
onset in their exposure (after more than 2 years on study) that stretched over months and even 
years.  
•  A mean decrease in GFR has been noted in Esperoct treated patients across all age groups over 
a mean treatment duration of 3-3.6 years. These data show a steady decline in GFR which might 
theoretically be associated with prolonged PEG exposure. One could argue that, in an adult 
population, there is an age related decline in GFR over time, however the observed decline in the 
adult population of the safety set exceeds such an expected “physiological” decline. Furthermore 
the observed difference is most pronounced (change: -16.5; change%: -13.1%). in the 
adolescent age group (12-17 years).  
The applicant discussed that GFR rates (and the observed decreases) in children and adolescents were 
potentially confounded. The serum creatinine levels were provided and showed no trend towards a 
gradual worsening of kidney function in any age group studied. An uncertainty pertains to the fact, that 
the applicant did not present valid GFR data for this population. For the adult population it could be 
shown, that patients with normal GFR at baseline displayed a pattern that rather resembles a 
physiological decrease in GFR than being treatment driven. No abnormally high PEG levels could be 
associated with patients with abnormal renal function. Concerning headaches of abnormally long 
duration, it seemed that this finding is rather a question of reporting practice. Due to longer intervals 
between visits, headaches were displayed as continuous, when individual data suggests that they were 
rather “occasional”. Neurologic exams of the nine patients in question were unremarkable and no plasma 
total PEG levels that were abnormally high (compared to the rest of the study population after comparable 
treatment duration) were identified. 
Safety of N8-GP from 2 processes (pivotal and commercial)  
A subset of patients (n=92) was switched from the pivotal process to the commercial process in the 
extension phases of trials 3885 and 3859. No new trend in the safety profile was seen following 
administration of Esperoct from the commercial process in the phase 3 trials nor from single dose 
administration in trial 4033. Quality and non-clinical comparisons were suggestive of comparability of 
both processes. Due to this comparability, it is acceptable to study the commercial product only in a 
subset of patients and for relatively shorter exposure times. No concern is hence raised from a safety 
perspective. 
Laboratory analysis 
Standard biochemistry and haematologic parameters were assessed in all the clinical trials. Overall, no 
clinically relevant changes in adverse events associated with exposure to Esperoct have been observed.  
Special populations 
In the trials overall, there were only 3 patients ≥65 years of age. The safety of Esperoct could therefore 
not be analysed separately in a meaningful matter beyond description of the single cases. Six (6) patients 
were below 2 years of age at the time of inclusion in trial. At the data cut-off date, the number of exposure 
days with Esperoct for these patients ranged from 337 to 391 exposure days. Out of 53 adverse events 
reported in these 6 patients,2 events were reported as serious adverse events: 1 event of fall and 1 event 
of sepsis syndrome.  Both events were judged as unlikely related to Esperoct by the investigator, and both 
patients recovered from the events. Beside long exposure the number of patients below 2 years of age is 
considered too small to exclude a different safety profile exists for those patients, however, existing data 
does not give particular rise of concern. No meaningful differences regarding race of study participants 
were identified.

FVIII inhibitors 
One positive case was identified in trial 3859 in an 18-year-old previously treated patient on prophylactic 
treatment with Esperoct. After 93 exposure days to Esperoct a FVIII inhibitor test was positive for the first 
time with an observed titre of 1.3 BU. The result was confirmed in the follow-up test 14 days later (1.9 
BU). Approximately 2.5 months later, the FVIII inhibitor titre increased to 13.5 BU, and the patient was 
withdrawn from the trial. The FVIII inhibitors had disappeared 5 months after the withdrawal from the 
study, and thereafter the patient returned to his previous FVIII product. The patient has not developed 
recurrent FVIII inhibitors after the withdrawal from the trial and until cut-off date for this application 
(approximately 3.5 years). 
The 1 event of confirmed FVIII inhibitors in the Esperoct clinical trials in previously treated patients 
resulted in an estimated rate of inhibitors of 0.4% and a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit for the 
inhibitor rate of 2.3%) (n=235 patients in the safety analysis set). In study 3859 itself the 97.5% upper 
confidence limit for the inhibitor rate was 3.8% with was contained in the pre-defined upper limit of 6.8% 
(n=155 at risk =>50ED). The incidence of inhibitor formation in PTPs for FVIII products is usually stated 
as “uncommon” which means frequencies range from 1/1000 to 1/10000. This means for study 3859 
(n=155 at risk), there is a reasonable chance for the occurrence of inhibitors to occur in this trial 
(≈1.5%-14%) if inhibitor formation is truly “uncommon” for Esperoct treated patients. Precision of 
inhibitor incidence is low, leaving some uncertainty of whether the single observed case could be 
indicative of higher frequencies which would be not compatible with the ‘uncommon’ category. 
In trial 3885 in pediatric patients two positive tests for FVIII inhibitors were noted. Those could however 
not be confirmed in a second test, nor in any later tests and are hence per protocol not considered true 
positive cases.  
Non inhibitor antibodies 
Assessments of non-neutralising anti-N8-GP antibodies and anti-PEG antibodies were done in all clinical 
trials. Assessments of anti-CHO HCP antibodies were performed in all trials in cases of a severe 
allergic/anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, the protocols for trials 3859 and 3885 were amended to also 
include routine analysis of anti-CHO HCP antibodies using the blood samples drawn for anti-N8-GP 
antibodies if the blood sample volume allowed. In summary the incidence of newly arising anti N8-GP, anti 
PEG and anti-CHO HCP was low in the presented safety analysis set. There was however a considerably 
amount of patients who were (not surprisingly) baseline positive for PEG antibodies (12.6% of the 
patients in trials 3859 and 3885, most prevalent in age group from 0–5 years (48.5%)). Due to low 
incidence and no distinct correlation to adverse events, it seems unlikely that in pretreated patients, (non 
inhibitor) antibody development (anti N8-GP, anti-PEG, anti-CHO HCP) under N8-GP treatment 
represents a widespread risk that impacts the safety profile of Esperoct in a meaningful matter. 
Discontinuations 
While serious adverse events and events of special interest are discussed in their respective sections, the 
overall number of discontinuations due to adverse events is low considering the long duration of both 
studies (9 (nine) including 2(two) patients who met withdrawal criteria (high titre FVIII inhibition and 
hypersensitivity). No currently unknown risk for FVIII treatment is deduced from this finding. 
Previously untreated patients 
The applicant presented preliminary data of the ongoing trial 3908 that includes previously untreated 
patients below 6 years of age, with no prior use of purified FVIII containing clotting products (5 previous 
exposure days to blood components are acceptable). As of the data cut-off date in trial 3908, 32 
previously untreated patients were exposed to Esperoct for a total of 2901 exposure days (ranging from 
1 to 354 exposure days per patient). A total of 14 serious adverse events were reported in 9 patients. Four 
(4) patients have developed FVIII inhibitors; 1 patient had a high peak titre of 6.1 BU and 3 patients had 
low peak titre of 1.0, 1.6 and 4.9 BU, respectively. One (1) of the FVIII inhibitor patients (4.9 BU) was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 131/144 
 
 
 
 
 
withdrawn due to the patient’s withdrawal of consent. The other 3 patients continued in the trial. In 
addition, 1 patient had a single positive FVIII inhibitor test taken at a local laboratory showing at titre of 
1.0 BU. However, a central laboratory test taken shortly after in this patient was negative. 
In general, the fact, that previously untreated patients develop FVIII inhibitors is not uncommon, and the 
observed incidence of 4/32 patients (two with low peak titre, one borderline case and one with high peak 
titre) developing inhibitors at some point of the study seems within the range of observed incidences of 
FVIII treatment.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The observed adverse event profile is in general considered comparable to that of other licensed FVIII 
products and did not give rise to concern. The safety database available generally complies with guideline 
requirements. However, due to major uncertainties regarding a potential tissue accumulation of PEG, the 
risk profile of Esperoct treatment is currently not outweighed by its benefit for all age groups. Due to 
potential risks to brain development, Esperoct should not be used in children <12 years of age.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP considers based on the available quality and clinical data, that turoctocog alfa pegol is 
considered to be a new active substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety 
and/or efficacy from turoctocog alfa contained in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within the 
European Union.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Esperoct (turoctocog alfa pegol) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it has an imposed PASS.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Esperoct is proposed for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of clotting 
factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of comprehensive 
haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home 
treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with 
haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
The recent development of FVIII products with extended half-lives has made it possible to maintain 
higher FVIII activity levels with fewer injections. Two extended half-life FVIII products are currently 
licensed (Elocta and Adynovi). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A total of five clinical studies were submitted to support the MAA of Esperoct. All trials enrolled PTPs 
suffering from severe haemophilia A. The main evidence derives from trials 3779 (PK), 3895 (PK, safety, 
efficacy in adolescents and adults) and 3885 (PK, safety, efficacy in children) whereas trials 3860 
(surgery) and 4033 (PK comparison pivotal – commercial product) are considered supportive. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In clinical trials an approximately 1.6-fold increase of half-life of Esperoct compared to the 
patients´previous products was shown. 
Assessment report

Different assays (different chromogenic assays and a clotting assay) with different calibrators (PSS, NHP) 
were used throughout the clinical development programme. Obviously, results for PK parameters differ 
depending on the assay and calibrator used. The chromogenic assay with PSS as calibrator has turned out 
to be the most suitable assays/calibrator combination. Therefore, the results from this assay and 
calibrator are considered the most useful and these results are included in the summary documents 
accordingly. 
The ABR in the main phase of trial 3859 (primary analysis) was 3.70 (2.94; 4.66) for Q4D and twice 
weekly prophylaxis. In extension phase 1, ABR for randomized patients was 1.77 (0.59; 5.32) for Q4D 
and 3.57 (2.13; 6.00) for once weekly prophylaxis. This is below the predefined threshold of 8.5. 
In the main phase of trial 3859 the majority of BEs was resolved with one, i.e. 338/436 (77.5%), or two 
injections, i.e. 70/436 (16.1%) in prophylaxis patients. Also in on-demand patients the majority of BEs 
was resolved with one, i.e. 471/532 (88.5%), or two injections, i.e. 45/532 (8.5%). These results are in 
support of haemostatic efficacy of N8-GP. Also results of the remaining endpoints are demonstrating 
favorable effects of N8-GP with regards to efficacy. 
Haemostatic response was evaluated during the main phase of trial 3859 as excellent for 44% of BEs and 
good for 39.9% of BEs, resulting in a success rate of 83.7% (79.0; 87.5) in the prophylaxis arm. In the 
on-demand arm haemostatic response was evaluated as excellent for 60.2% of BEs and good for 32.0%, 
resulting in a success rate of 88.4% (80.0; 93.5). 
In the paediatric trial 3885, ABR during the main phase was 1.94 (1.10; 3.42) in younger children and 
2.30 (1.40; 3.75) in older children and 2.13 (1.48; 3.06) in total. ABR during main phase and extension 
phase was 0.85 (0.49; 1.47) in younger children and 1.50 (1.03; 2.18) in older children and in total 1.20 
(0.88; 1.64).  
The majority of BEs was resolved with one injection, i.e. 18/30 (60%) in younger children and 26/40 
(65.0%) in older children and 44/70 (62.9%) in total; or two injections, i.e. 5/30 (16.7%) in younger 
children and 7/40 (17.5%) in older children and 12/70 (17.1%) in total. Results from the combined main 
and extension phase 1 analysis were found to be similar. 
Success rate for haemostatic response was 80.0% (59.9; 91.4) in younger children and 77.4% (63.4; 
87.2) during the main phase of the paediatric trial. In total, the success rate was 78.6% (67.1; 86.9).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In extension phase 1 of trial 3859 patients fulfilling switching criteria (0-2 bleeding episodes during the 
last 6 months) were offered to be randomized to once weekly regimen (75 IU/kg) resulting in selected 
patients exposed to Q7D prophylaxis. It is questionable that the estimated Q7D ABRs can serve as reliable 
basis to inform regulatory decision making concerning interval extensions above 3 days. Furthermore, 
Q7D prophylaxis was the only alternative to Q4D prophylaxis and no continuously prolonged intervals 
were investigated. A total of 120 patients were eligible for randomization to either Q7D or Q4D 
prophylaxis. However, only 55 out of these 120 patients were willing to be randomized. According to the 
applicant the increased visit schedule associated with the randomization might be a major contributor to 
this or concerns in patients that they, due to the relatively lower factor coverage under Q7D, might not be 
able to maintain their current lifestyle, e.g., participate in sport activities. In extension phase 1, ABR for 
randomized patients was 1.77 (0.59; 5.32) for Q4D and 3.57 (2.13; 6.00) for once weekly prophylaxis 
resulting in a ratio of 2.02 (0.60; 6.80). Although the predefined threshold of an ABR below 8.5 was met, 
the point estimate for ABR was about twice as high during once weekly prophylaxis on average. Given the 
rather low precision of the derived estimate for the ABR ratio, even the potential of a more than 6-fold 
increase of ABR could not be ruled out with certainty. Moreover, 9/38 patients in extension 1 and almost 
half of the patients, i.e. 23/52 patients in extension 2, respectively, switched back to Q4D prophylaxis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 137/144 
 
 
 
Overall, during the conduct of the study, 61 patients switched to Q7D prophylaxis of whom more than half 
of the patients (n=37) switched back to Q4D. Considering the latter, the recommended starting dose is 50 
IU of Esperoct per kg body weight every 4 days. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The available safety database fulfils guideline requirements in terms of number of subjects and exposure 
days. A total of 2307 adverse events were reported in 239 (89%) patients. The majority of the adverse 
events (88%) were non-serious. 66 adverse events in 42 (16%) patients were rated as severe. The most 
common adverse events were rash, erythema, pruritus and injection site reactions. 
A total of 13 adverse events in 7 patients of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis were judged as 
possibly or probably related to Esperoct by the investigator; all non-serious and of mild or moderate 
severity, except 1 serious adverse event of severe hypersensitivity that eventually resolved after 
cessation of treatment. Allergic reaction is an identified risk (please see RMP). A warning on 
hypersensitivity is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
One confirmed case of FVIII inhibitor occurred in pivotal trial 3859 in a PTP. The patient was eventually 
withdrawn from the study. This case resulted in an estimated rate of inhibitors of 0.4% and a 1-sided 
97.5% upper confidence limit for the inhibitor rate of 2.3% in the overall safety analysis set. In the 
analysis set of study 3859 itself the 97.5% upper confidence limit for the inhibitor rate was 3.8% which is 
below the pre-defined upper limit of 6.8%. A warning on the formation of neutralising antibodies is 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Four patients developed non-neutralising (anti-N8-GP) antibodies after dosing with N8-GP. One of these 
patients was the FVIII inhibitor patient, and the other 3 patients were only transiently positive.  
In total, 32 (12.6%) of the patients in trials 3859 and 3885 had pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies of which 
the age group from 0–5 years had the highest frequency (48.5%). Across all trials, 11/254 patients 
developed transient low-titre anti-PEG antibodies. Formation of Anti-PEG antibodies has been identified 
as a potential risk (please see RMP). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although the size of the available database exceeds guideline requirements, the limited number of 
subjects allows only the detection of common and very common adverse events, additional safety studies 
will provide more information on the long term safety (please see RMP). 
The likelihood to observe a case in a study with ≈150 patients (patients at risk n=155 in trial 3859) 
ranges from about 1.4 to 14% if the incidence for FVIII inhibition is considered as uncommon. Precision 
of inhibitor incidence is low, leaving some uncertainty of whether the single observed case could be 
indicative of higher frequencies which would be not compatible with the ‘uncommon’ category. 
Published data from long-term nonclinical studies with other PEGylated proteins have shown vacuolation 
in macrophages and in cells of excretory organs like the kidney, liver and choroid plexus. Potential 
accumulation of the 40kD PEG- moiety in the nervous system tissue or other human tissue/organs as well 
as any potential clinical impact, such as on brain development in children e.g. on cognitive, functional or 
metabolic properties, remains an unknown risk of Esperoct when used for long-term treatment. 
Accumulation of PEG was not identified on preclinical level, however, hepatic and renal 
immunohistochemistry was not performed in kidneys and liver in toxicity studies. With regard to low 
amounts of radiolabeled Esperoct detected in the rat brain as a result of the biodistribution study the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 138/144 
 
 
 
 
 
concern that PEG penetrated the blood-brain barrier could be alleviated by the applicant’s response 
indicating that PEG-related radioactivity was confined to the blood vessels and capillaries of the brain. 
However long term treatment with Esperoct in patients younger than 12 years currently presents a 
potential risk that is not sufficiently addressed by available data. Therefore, the indication of Esperoct is 
limited to adults and adolescents twelve years and above. In addition, a post-authorisation safety study 
will be conducted to investigate the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the 
brain and other tissues/organs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of Esperoct for prevention and treatment of bleeding has been convincingly demonstrated. 
The main feature of Esperoct is the prolonged half-life due to pegylation compared to conventional FVIII 
products which could potentially result in a reduced number of injections or increased treatment intervals 
for prophylactic treatment. This is reflected by the proposed regimen of Q4D or twice weekly prophylaxis 
for Esperoct which results in slightly prolonged intervals compared to prophylaxis with conventional FVIII 
products (these are usually used at intervals of 2 to 3 days). Potential risks associated with PEG, such as 
a potential impact on brain development, or accumulation in other tissues such as kidneys and liver are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 141/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of particular concern in children below 12 years of age. Neither juvenile toxicity studies nor long term 
safety studies addressing the risk of PEG accumulation in paediatric patients were performed to address 
this risk. On the other hand, only modest prolongation of half-life was reached and no substantially 
prolonged treatment intervals for prophylactic treatment were investigated in children below 12 years of 
age. Therefore, benefits fail to outweigh the substantial potential risks associated with PEG in the 
paediatric population below 12 years of age. The indication is restricted accordingly. In addition, a 
post-authorisation safety study has been imposed to the applicant in order to investigate the potential 
effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
From  the  clinical  viewpoint,  efficacy  of  Esperoct  regarding  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  bleeding 
events  as  well  as  in  the  haemostatic  management  of  surgical  procedures  has  been  sufficiently 
demonstrated.  
Concerning safety, there is an unknown risk regarding long-term exposure to PEG. Currently, it is 
unknown if potential accumulation in various organs and tissues could have relevant clinical 
consequences. Of particular concern is the potential clinical impact on brain development in children e.g. 
on cognitive, functional or metabolic properties. Therefore, the indication is limited to adults and 
adolescents. A post-authorisation safety study has been imposed to the applicant in order to investigate 
the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs. 
The  observed  adverse  event  profile  is  considered  acceptable.  Therefore,  the  benefit  risk  balance  is 
positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Esperoct is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Esperoct is favourable in the following indication: 
“Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency).” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 142/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measure 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Post-authorisation safety study (PASS): In order to investigate the potential 
effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other 
tissues/organs, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a 
post-authorisation safety study according to an agreed protocol. 
Due date 
31/12/2027 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that turoctocog alfa pegol is a new active 
substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to efficacy from turoctocog alfa contained in 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
This is attributed to the addition of PEGylation of the product during manufacture. Clinical data has 
demonstrated that the half-life of Esperoct is prolonged by 1.6-fold compared to patients on their 
previous FVIII product. When comparing the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after dosing 50 IU/kg of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/352302/2019  
Page 143/144 
 
 
 
Esperoct and NovoEight, the half-life is approximately 10 hours longer for Esperoct than for NovoEight 
resulting in a lower clearance and substantially greater AUC. The improved PK properties of Esperoct 
results in the total exposure to FVIII activity being substantially higher after administration of Esperoct 
compared to NovoEight and thereby allowing for less frequent dosing. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0142/2017 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

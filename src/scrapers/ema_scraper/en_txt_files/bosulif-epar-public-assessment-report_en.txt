1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Pfizer  Limited  submitted  on  28  July  2011  an  application  for  Marketing  Authorisation  to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Bosulif, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article  3(1)  and  point  3  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  Eligibility  for  the  centralised 
procedure was agreed by the EMA/CHMP on 29 June 2010.  
Bosulif (bosutinib) was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/762 on 4 August 2010. 
Bosulif was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukaemia.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Bosulif as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's 
website ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Bosulif is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) in 
chronic phase (CP). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/170/2010 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the application contained a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance bosutinib monohydrate contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a product previously authorised within the Union.

Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 20 September 2007 and 17 December 2009. 
The Scientific Advice pertained to quality and clinical aspects of the dossier.  
Licensing status 
A new application was filed in the following countries: United States. 
The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The CHMP considered that bosutinib falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006: 
Article 2(1) – medicinal product which aims at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis 
of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases. 
Article 2(3) – medicinal product designated as orphan medicinal product in accordance with Article 3 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000.  
In accordance with Article 3 (2) of Regulation EC No 507/2006, the CHMP proposed the application to 
be considered for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation based on the following claims: 
• 
The  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  medicinal  product,  as  defined  in  Article  1(28a)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive. 
Based  on  post-hoc  analyses  from  study  200-WW,  bosutinib  has  demonstrated  a  positive  risk-benefit 
balance in patients who had exhausted all available TKI therapies (imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) or 
for  whom  treatment  with  other  available  TKIs  was  deemed  unsuitable  by  their  physicians.  This  data 
includes  patients  with  primary  and  acquired  resistance  as  well  as  those  with  intolerance  to  the 
approved TKI.  
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
Additional  comprehensive clinical  data  are  likely  to be  provided  from  a  clinical  interventional  study  of 
bosutinib  in  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-positive  chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia  (Ph+ 
CML) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib 
and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options.  
Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled primarily at large medical centres in Europe and the United 
States, with the intent to enroll up to 75 patients in the 4th or later line setting. 
The estimate probability of Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) (chronic phase) and Confirmed Overall 
Haematological  Response  (OHR)  (accelerated  and  blast  phase)  by  one  year  is  proposed  as  primary 
endpoint. Efficacy data will be collected at regularly scheduled time-points at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in 
the different CML patient populations. 
It  is  expected  that  this  study  will  further  support  the  efficacy  of  bosutinib  in  the  intended  last-line 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  phase  (CP),  accelerated  phase  (AP),  and  blast  phase  (BP) 
Philadelphia  chromosome positive  chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia  (Ph+  CML)  previously  treated  with 
one  or  more  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not 
considered appropriate treatment options. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  this  trial  is  feasible  and  that  it  is  likely  to  provide  comprehensive  clinical 
data in the approved target population.

• 
Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled. 
There  is  a  lack  of  approved  and  standard  of  care  pharmacological  treatment  for  adult  patients  with 
chronic  phase  (CP),  accelerated  phase  (AP),  and  blast  phase  (BP)  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive 
chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia  (Ph+  CML)  previously  treated  with  one  or  more  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered  appropriate  treatment 
options. 
• 
The  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  on  the  market  of  the  medicinal 
product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
Beneficial effects have been reported in the proposed target population. The safety profile of bosutinib 
seems manageable with the proposed SmPC and RMP. In view of the unmet medical need, the benefits 
to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  on  the  market  of  the  medicinal  product  concerned 
outweigh the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

• 
The Rapporteurs circulated the Joint Assessment Report on the applicant’s responses to the 2nd List 
of Outstanding Issues to all CHMP members on 8 January 2013 (Annex 8). 
•  During the meeting on 17 January 2013, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and 
the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a conditional 
Marketing Authorisation to Bosulif.  
• 
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Bosulif with Glivec, Sprycel and Tasigna on 20 October 
2011 (Appendix 1). In April 2012, Glivec was removed from the Community Register on Orphan 
medicinal products and is therefore no longer under market exclusivity protection. Since the CHMP 
concluded that Bosulif and Glivec are not similar, this has no effect on the outcome of the report on 
similarity adopted by the CHMP on 20 October 2011 (Appendix 1).  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a haematopoietic stem cell disease characterised by a 
proliferation of granulocytes and their immature myeloid precursors including blast cells. The disease is 
causally linked to a characteristic cytogenetic abnormality resulting from a reciprocal translocation of 
the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22. The shortened chromosome 22, known as the Philadelphia 
chromosome (Ph), is detected in at least 95% of patients with CML. As a result of the translocation, 
the terminal portion of Abelson kinase gene (c-abl) on chromosome 9 is juxtaposed to the proximal 
breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22, producing the breakpoint cluster region-
Abelson kinase (BCR ABL) fusion gene or BCR-ABL rearrangement. The resultant oncogene encodes an 
enzyme, the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, which exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. This oncoprotein 
phosphorylates numerous substrates, resulting in the dysregulation of intracellular signal transduction 
pathways for proliferation and genetic instability, apoptosis suppression, and cellular adhesion. CML is 
the most common phenotype of Ph+ leukaemias and is most frequently associated with a 210 kD Bcr-
Abl fusion protein. The remaining 5% or fewer patients with CML do not have Ph but possess a BCR-
ABL rearrangement (Ph-negative, BCR-ABL-positive), which can be detected by sensitive molecular 
techniques, such as RT-PCR or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). 
Untreated CML commonly progresses in 3 phases: chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and 
blast phase (BP). The majority of patients are diagnosed during CP, which is characterised by an 
increased number of leukocytes and/or platelets and a bone marrow blast count less than 15%. If 
untreated, the initial CP lasts approximately 3 to 5 years. Progress often occurs through the AP to a 
terminal BP. AP may be marked by 1 or more of the following: increasing splenomegaly and 
leukocytosis, an increase of blasts to 15% to 29%, an increase of basophils to 20% or greater, 
thrombocytopenia, and clonal evolution. In BP, for which the median survival is 2-4 months, 30% or 
more of blood and bone marrow cells are blasts, and myeloid precursors may also form tumours in the 
lymph nodes, skin, and bone. Patients with BP are the most refractory to treatment and can be divided 
into 1 of 2 categories: those with myeloid disease and those with lymphoid disease. The rate of 
response to standard induction chemotherapy for patients in myeloid BP is approximately 20%, and 
the rate of complete remission is less than 10%. For patients in lymphoid BP, the rate of response is 
approximately 50%, but remissions are transient. 
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative strategy for CML. Other 
treatments including chemotherapy, interferon alpha, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are 
effective in controlling the disease to varying degrees in all populations. The utility of HSCT is largely 
limited to paediatric and younger adult patients, especially those with matched donors, and is 
associated with a substantial rate of morbidity and mortality. Because of this, alternate treatments 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/87 
 
 
 
were developed, among which agents targeting the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, such as TKIs, are 
considered frontline therapy. 
The first TKI was imatinib which was granted approval by the EC in November 2001. Between 17 and 
25% of patients either fail or become intolerant to imatinib during the first 5 years of treatment, with 
an estimated annual rate of 3.3% after 1 year, 7.5% in 2nd year, 4.8% in 3rd year, 1.5% in 4th year, 
and 0.9% after 5 years of treatment. Second generation TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib, were initially 
approved in 2006 and 2007, respectively, for the treatment of patients with resistance or intolerance 
to prior therapy including imatinib. In 2010, both substances were additionally approved for adult 
patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in CP. 
Both dasatinib and nilotinib have distinct safety profiles that may prohibit certain subjects from 
receiving them as treatment for CML. In patients who are resistant or intolerant to all TKIs currently 
available (imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib), a high unmet medical need exists. Currently, if a stem cell 
transplantation cannot be performed, these patients have to be treated with interferon and cytostatic 
agents.  
Bosutinib is a second generation TKI that binds the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl in an intermediate 
conformation thereby inhibiting Abl kinase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 1 nM. In cell lines 
transfected with both wild type and imatinib-resistant mutant BCR-ABL it suppressed proliferation. In 
imatinib-sensitive CML cell lines, the in-vitro inhibitory activity of bosutinib was up to 100-fold that of 
imatinib, with IC50 values ranging from 1 to 20 nM. In imatinib-resistant cell lines (with or without 
mutations) bosutinib’s inhibition of proliferation was up to 114-fold that of imatinib. Bosutinib also 
inhibited phosphorylation of various signalling proteins and downstream substrates of Bcr-Abl, most 
notably the transcription factor Stat5 and the docking protein CrkL. 
Additionally, cell migration and invasion via Src kinase activity were inhibited by bosutinib, with an 
IC50 of 3.5 nM, and a comparable inhibitory activity against other Src family kinases (SFKs). While 
Bcr-Abl kinase activity is the primary oncogenic driver in CML, SFK activity is believed to contribute to 
disease pathogenesis. SFKs associate with Bcr-Abl, resulting in activation of the SKFs, further 
phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl, and increased downstream signalling. Resistance to imatinib in culture has 
been associated with increased expression of the SFK Lyn, and dual Src/Abl inhibitors such as bosutinib 
retain therapeutic effectiveness in these instances.  
This application was initially based on data of pivotal phase III study 3160A4-3000-WW, a randomised, 
open-label study in comparison with imatinib. At this time the proposed indication applied was: 
Bosulif is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP). 
Following review, the final indication for bosutinib proposed was: 
Bosulif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  phase  (CP),  accelerated 
phase  (AP),  and  blast  phase  (BP)  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  chronic  myelogenous 
leukaemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for 
whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options.

mg. They are identified by different film-coat colours (yellow for the 100 mg tablets, red for the 500 
mg tablets) and appropriate debossing (“100” or “500”) on one side of the tablet and “Pfizer” on the 
other side. 
The composition of the product is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The tablets are packed in white opaque 3-ply Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/ACLAR/PVC blisters sealed with 
push-through foil backing. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Bosutinib monohydrate is a crystalline, non-hygroscopic white to yellowish tan powder with pH 
dependent aqueous solubility across the physiological pH range. At or below pH 5, it behaves as a high 
solubility compound; but above pH 5 its solubility reduces rapidly. It is soluble in acetone, methylethyl 
ketone, 2-propanol, ethyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetonitrile, methanol; sparingly soluble in 
isopropyl acetate; and slightly soluble in toluene and heptanes. 
The chemical name of bosutinib monohydrate is 3-Quinolinecarbonitrile, 4-[(2,4-dichloro-5-
methoxyphenyl)amino]-6-methoxy-7-[3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) propoxy]-, hydrate (1:1). The 
molecular formula is C26H29Cl 2N5O3⋅H2O and the structural formula is as follows: 
Bosutinib has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
The chemical structure of the molecule has been established by spectral (FTIR, UV-VIS, mass 
spectrometry ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy) and elemental analysis. 
Since bosutinib monohydrate (Form 1) is the thermodynamically favoured solid state form, this form 
was selected for development and commercialisation. Bosutinib monohydrate, the active substance of 
Bosulif, is a new active substance and is not described in any pharmacopoeia. 
Manufacture 
Bosutinib  is  supplied  by  one  active  substance  manufacturer.  It  is  synthesised  in  several  steps  using 
commercially  available  well  defined  starting  materials.  The  manufacturing  process  conditions  have 
been designed to robustly and reproducibly produce the monohydrate (Form 1).  
The manufacturing process has been adequately described and critical in-process controls parameters 
have  been  well  established  and  justified.  Satisfactory  specifications  have  been  set  for  reagents, 
solvents and auxiliary materials used in the process.  
Bosutinib monohydrate is packaged into a polyethylene bag (PE) which is inserted in a second PE and 
stored  in  in  a  metal  drum  or  equivalent  secondary container.  Specifications  and  analytical  reports  for 
the  packaging  components  have  been  presented  and  the  suitability  of  the  polyethylene  bags  for  use 
with food and pharmaceuticals has been confirmed.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), particle size (laser 
diffraction), identification (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), residual solvents (GC-
FID), residue ignition (Ph.Eur.), Palladium (ICP-OES), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), and organic impurities 
(HPLC). 
The  absence  of  a  test  to  confirm  the  solid  state  form  in  the  drug  substance  specification  has  been 
adequately  justified  based  on  development  studies,  batch  analysis  data  and  stability  studies  which 
demonstrated that bosutinib monohydrate form 1 is consistently produced. 
The specification proposed is suitable to control the quality of the drug substance manufactured using 
the current process, and has been established taking into account relevant ICH guidelines. 
The  non-compendial  analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  according  to 
ICH Q2 (R1) guideline.  
Batch analysis data on four commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Data from stability studies on three production scale batches have been provided. Samples were stored  
for up to  24 months under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and for 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40°C/75% RH) in accordance with ICH requirements.   
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  assay  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  impurities 
(HPLC), and crystallinity (PXRD). In all cases the batch analysis data met the predefined specification 
and no significant changes were observed.  
In addition, a photostability study following ICH guideline Q1B was performed, revealing that bosutinib 
monohydrate drug substance is not light sensitive.  
Stability data under stress conditions (acid, base, oxidation, heat and light) have been also provided to 
confirm the suitability of the assay and purity methods and to identify potential degradation products 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  immediate  release  tablets  containing 
100mg or 500 mg bosutinib monohydrate suitable for oral administration, once daily, in adult patients. 
The development programme of the commercial bosutinib tablet formulation focused on the 
investigation physicochemical properties of the drug substance and excipients important for the 
manufacturability and performance of the product. The results of these studies were used to optimise 
the qualitative and quantitative composition of the formulation. 
As  mentioned  above,  Form  1  was  selected  for  development  and  commercialization  because  it  is  the 
thermodynamically  favoured  solid  form.  Subsequent  development  studies  confirmed  that  during 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 13/87 
 
 
 
 
 
routine  manufacture  of  the  commercial  drug  product  using  the  commercial  manufacturing  process, 
bosutinib monohydrate Form I was maintained through all processing steps. 
Permeability studies conducted in accordance with the BCS classification guidance supported the 
classification of bosutinib as a low permeability drug. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies conducted 
showed that the in-vivo absorption of bosutinib is controlled by permeability rather than dissolution of 
the tablet formulation. 
The  excipients  of  this  drug  product  were  selected  based  upon  their  suitability  for  use  and  the 
compatibility  studies  performed.    Based  on  the  results,  the  following  excipients  were  selected: 
microcrystalline  cellulose  as  a  diluent  and  compression  aid,  croscarmellose  sodium  as  a  disintegrant, 
poloxamer  188  as  a  binder  and  a  solubilising/wetting  agent,  povidone  as  a  binding  agent  and 
magnesium stearate as a lubricant. All these excipients comply with the Ph. Eur.  
Suitable  specifications  have  been  set  for  the  excipients  used  for  film-coating.  In  addition  statements 
that the colouring agents are controlled by Directive 2009/35/EC have been provided.Bosutinib tablets 
are packaged in PVC/Aclar/PVC blister material with aluminium foil backing. All packaging components 
are listed as ‘Generally Recognised As Safe (GRAS)’ or ‘suitable for direct and/or indirect contact with 
food’  per  current  EU  Directives  (i.e.  2002/72/EC)  covering  food  packaging  materials.  All  packaging 
components also comply, where applicable, with current European Pharmacopeia. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in the manufacture of bosutinib 100 mg and 500 mg film coated tablets 
are of human or animal origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process has been sufficiently described. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Adequate  in-process  controls  have  been  set  up  and  a  detailed  description  along  with  a  process  flow 
scheme have been provided. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing  process  and  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  capable  and  to  be  able  to  reproducibly 
produce finished product of the intended quality. The in process controls are adequate for this tablets 
preparation.  
The batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches for each of the strengths proposed (100 mg 
and 500 mg) shows that the tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished 
product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, identification (UV, 
HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  dissolution  (UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.),  degradation  products 
(HPLC),  total  aerobic  microbial  count  (Ph.  Eur.),  total  combined  yeast/mould  count  (Ph.Eur.),  E.  coli 
(Ph. Eur.), titanium dioxide and iron oxide identification (colorimetric).  
The  absence  of  a  test  for  solid  form  in  the  drug  product  specification  is  justified  based  on  batch 
analysis data and stability studies conducted on representative small scale 100mg and 500mg tablets 
manufactured  using  the  proposed  commercial  formulation  and  by  the  commercial  manufacturing 
process 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 14/87 
 
 
 
The  finished  product  specifications  are  considered  appropriate  for  this  dosage  form,  and  they  are  in 
general in accordance with current guidelines and European pharmacopoeia.  
Batch  analysis  results  in  three  production  scale  batches  of  each  strength  confirm  consistency  and 
uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
The  non-compendial  analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  in  accordance 
with ICH Q2 (R1). 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  production  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  bosutinib  film-coated  tablets 
packaged  in  PVC/Aclar  blisters  stored  under  long  term  conditions  (25°C/60%  RH)    or  intermediate 
conditions  (30°C/75%  RH)  for  24  months,  and  for  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions 
(40ºC/75%RH) according to ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were tested for appearance (visual 
inspection),  assay  (HPLC),  dissolution  (UV),  degradation  products  (HPLC)  and  microbial  purity 
(Ph.Eur.) and water content. In all cases the batch analysis data met the predefined specification and 
no significant changes were observed. 
Although  the  container  used  in  the  stability  studies  (PVC/Aclar  blisters)  was  different  from  the 
proposed  commercial  packaging  (PVC/Aclar/PVC  blisters),  suitable  comparative  permeability  data 
showing equivalence of both systems has been presented. 
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes were observed in 
any  of  the  stability  attributes  monitored  in  this  study  confirming  that  bosutinib  100  mg  and  500  mg 
tablets are not sensitive to light. 
In conclusion, the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for 
the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  medicinal  product  consists  of  oral  immediate  release  film  coated  tablets.  Relevant  ICH/CHMP 
guidelines and Pharmacopoeial requirements have been followed in the quality documentation.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The goal of the nonclinical studies was to support the registration of bosutinib for the treatment of 
CML. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Bosutinib was developed as a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor for the treatment of CML. The submitted 
pharmacodynamic studies confirm the antiproliferative activity of bosutinib. The drug inhibited Bcr-Abl 
signalling in a number of CML cell lines and in progenitor cells from patients at low nanomolar 
concentrations. Bosutinib also had pro-apoptotic activity as shown on CD34 positive cells from 
imatinib-resistant patients expressing different mutated forms of Bcr-Abl. Compared to imatinib, 
nilotinib and dasatinib, bosutinib showed little or no effect against the receptors c-Kit and PDGF 
(Platelet derived growth factor).  
Besides Scr and Abl kinases, bosutinib showed inhibitory activities against a panel of other kinases, 
notably against the tyrosine protein kinase (TEC) family kinases, which are known to elicit immune-
related side-effects. However, inhibition of TEC kinases through bosutinib had no or little influence on 
the observed side effects.  
Various tumour xenograft models in nude mice were used to evaluate antitumour activity of bosutinib, 
including the K562 CML model. Bosutinib also was active in Src-transformed rat fibroblast tumours and 
other tumours which express Src, such as human colorectal, breast, prostate, pancreatic and lung 
tumours. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies showed that bosutinib inhibited alpha 1 (80%) and 2 (60%) non-
selective  adrenergic  receptors;  histamine  H2  receptor  (89%);  non-selective  muscarinic  receptor 
(central) (64%); sodium site 2 ion channel (66%); serotonin transporter (71%); sigma non-selective 
receptor (76%); and neurokinin A receptor (63%).  
Bosutinib demonstrated affinity toward receptors, ion channels, or transporters that have the potential 
for  functional  effects  on  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  or  peripheral  nervous  system  (sodium 
channel,  serotonin  transporter,  muscarinic  receptor),  cardiovascular  system  (sodium  channel,  alpha 
adrenergic  receptor,  muscarinic  receptor,  serotonin  transporter),  respiratory  system  (neurokinin  A 
receptor,  muscarinic  receptor),  gastrointestinal  (GI)  system  (histamine  2  receptor,  serotonin 
transporter), and immune system (neurokinin A receptor). Since signs of GI toxicity or irritation have 
been observed in both animal and human studies, it is possible that agonist activity of the H2 receptor 
or  inhibition  of  the  serotonin  transporters  may  lead  to  increased  gastric  secretion  or  nausea, 
respectively, at clinically relevant concentrations of bosutinib. The potential for agonist activity at the 
neurokinin  A  receptor  leading  to  a  proinflammatory  response  is  of  low  probability.  While  rash  was 
observed  in  some  patients,  an  inflammatory  response  was  not  observed  in  animal  studies  at 
concentrations exceeding those in humans. 
Bosutinib  M5  (N-desmethyl  bosutinib)  and  M2  (oxydechlorinated  bosutinib)  metabolites  were  also 
profiled at concentrations up to 10 μM. For M5, less than 50% inhibition of binding or enzyme activity 
was observed against all targets except the A2A, adrenergic α1, D1, D2S, M1, M2, M3, NK2, 5-HT1B, 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 16/87 
 
 
 
5-HT2A, and δ1 receptors, sodium (site 2) channels, and dopamine, choline transporters. The Ki/IC50 
values  of  these  receptors,  ion  channels,  and  transporters  were  ≥140  nM.  For  M2,  less  than  50% 
inhibition of binding or enzyme activity was observed against all targets except the A2A, adrenergic α1, 
D2S,  H3,  M1,  M3,  NK2,  and  5-HT1B  receptors,  and  dopamine  and  5-HT  transporters.  The  Ki/IC50 
values of these receptors, ion channels, and transporters were ≥900 nM. These findings do not indicate 
a significant risk of effects from the metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Bosutinib did not affect respiratory or CNS parameters in female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg. Other 
clinical observations were observed in both studies. Of notice is the occurrence of faecal alterations in 
the respiratory study, and in the CNS study a greater incidence of gait (≥ 300 mg/kg) and decreased 
pupil size (≥100 mg/kg) were noted. The NOEL for impaired gait occurred at exposures > 8-fold those 
in humans following the 500 mg dose and is therefore unlikely to be of relevance for humans.  
Safety  pharmacology  studies  with  major  bosutinib  metabolites  (M2  and  M5)  were  restricted  to  hERG 
inhibition  assays  (studies  PF05898965HERG  and  PF05312061HERG).  Although  neither  study  was 
conducted in compliance with GLP, the results seen for the standard comparator (terfenadine) in both 
studies were highly consistent with those seen in the GLP-compliant hERG inhibition studies (Chan test) 
with  bosutinib.  In  addition,  the  hERG  IC50  values  obtained  for  the  M5  and  M2  metabolites  (8.7  and 
27.9 µM, respectively) were several times greater than both the maximum total human concentration 
of  each  metabolite  after  a  500-mg  dose  of  bosutinib  (93-  and  503-fold,  respectively),  and  the  hERG 
IC50 for bosutinib (29 and 93-fold, respectively). 
Bosutinib caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the hERG current with IC50 values of 300 to 
700 nM. These IC50 values are only approximately 13-fold higher than the unbound fraction Cmax at the 
clinical dose of 500 mg. After single dose IV application of bosutinib in the dog, QTc prolongation was 
observed  at  all  dosages  tested  (3  –  15  mg/kg).  Since  a  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  biomarker  for 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias, it can be concluded that bosutinib treatment is associated with a risk for 
adverse effects regarding safety pharmacology. This risk for ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de 
pointes is discussed adequately in the SPC and the PL.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of bosutinib was investigated using the intended oral route and the IV route of 
administration. Absorption was moderate to rapid in all species tested following oral administration of 
bosutinib, with t max values ranging from 1.3 to 5.5 hours (absorption in humans was relatively slow 
with t max ranging from 3 -6 hours). The half-life of bosutinib was moderate in mice and rats (2.5 to 5.4 
hours) and long in dogs (13.5 to 17.7 hours). The mean half-life of bosutinib in healthy human 
subjects was longer still (33.8 hours). Clearance was moderate in mice and dogs (2.25 and 0.91, 
respectively) and high in rats (ranging from 7.68 to 4.22 in males and females, respectively). Gender 
differences were observed in rats. This effect could not be seen in dogs and mice since only female 
animals have been tested. Bosutinib concentration increased with increasing dose in rats and dogs. 
AUC-values on days 28 and 180 were approximately 3- to 5-fold higher in female rats than in male 
rats. Little or no accumulation of bosutinib or its circulating metabolite M5 (N-desmethyl bosutinib) was 
observed in plasma of rats given 50 mg/kg/day bosutinib for 56 consecutive days. 
Bosutinib acts as a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein, BRCP and MRPs. Since the in-vivo studies 
showed a moderate oral bioavailability in the tested animals, it is likely that absorption of bosutinib is 
not limited by these efflux transporters. 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 17/87 
 
 
 
 
Absorption of bosutinib was influenced by food: The results of a single dose study in female dogs 
showed that higher bosutinib exposures can be achieved in fed dogs compared with fasted dogs. 
However, the AUC-values under fasted and fed conditions were mostly similar, and since there was a 
high inter-individual variance as well as a very limited number of dogs (n=4), no conclusions can be 
drawn about the effect of food on the absorption of bosutinib from this study. Three different dog 
studies as part of the toxicokinetic evaluation showed similar results compared with the single dose 
study in female dogs. However, because the number of dogs was also very limited and inter-individual 
differences could be seen here as well, it seems likely that the bioavailability is higher under fed 
compared with fasted conditions but only to a minimal extent.  
High radioactivity of bosutinib was observed in albino rats in the harderian gland (which is absent in 
adult humans, but present in the foetus and neonate), the small intestine, large intestine, liver and 
adrenal gland. In pigmented rats, bosutinib-derived radioactivity showed a high affinity for melanin-
containing tissues, with higher exposures in the uveal tract than in the skin. The affinity for melanin-
containing tissues indicated a potential for phototoxicity. However, in a follow-up photosafety study, 
bosutinib was found not to be phototoxic. No radioactivity was detected in the brain, indicating that 
bosutinib did not pass the blood-brain barrier. Toxicokinetic studies in pregnant rats showed that 
bosutinib can cross the placenta to reach the foetus. The drug is also excreted in the milk of lactating 
rats. 
Bosutinib and the N-desmethyl bosutinib metabolite M5 are highly bound to plasma proteins (>93%) in 
mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans. The blood to plasma ratio (about 1) in in-vitro and in-vivo 
studies showed that distribution of bosutinib into the blood cell and plasma compartment is comparable 
in the pre-clinical species and humans. Accumulation of bosutinib in red blood cells seems therefore 
unlikely. 
The unchanged parent compound was found in plasma of humans and the examined animals. Although 
plasma metabolites could not be detected due to a dilution error in healthy humans after single dosing, 
the examination of plasma of humans with advanced malignant solid tumours and healthy subjects 
after multiple dosing showed similar results to those in animals. The primary route of excretion 
following oral administration was through the faeces. The bosutinib metabolites M2 (oxydechlorinated 
bosutinib) and M5 were the major metabolites found in humans and rats. Several other metabolites 
have been identified, but appear to play a minor role in metabolism. The safety of M2 was evaluated in 
a 6-month toxicity study in male rats, and plasma M5 concentrations were measured in the 2-year 
carcinogenicity study in rats. 
The results of in-vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism. 
Drug-drug interaction studies of bosutinib in combination with ketoconazole or rifampicin confirmed the 
role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of bosutinib. In human kidney microsomes the metabolite M6 was 
the major metabolite found and this metabolite was formed by FMO enzymes. However, FMOs 
contributed minimally to the formation of M6 in human liver microsomes. The metabolite M2 (as a 
circulating metabolite in human plasma) can be formed by both intestinal and hepatic UGTs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Bosutinib safety was assessed in a series of nonclinical studies. These studies included single and 
repeat dose toxicity, genetic toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and phototoxicity 
evaluations. Safety studies were also performed on the prominent human metabolite M2 (PF-
05898965) and the Relative Retention Time (RRT) 0.99 impurity.  The oral route was used in the 
majority of these studies as it is the intended clinical route.

Single dose toxicity 
The single-dose toxicity of bosutinib was evaluated in mice (RPT-52017; RPT-52016) and rats 
(RPT-52013; RPT-52015) after oral and IP administration at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (oral) and 
200 mg/kg (IP). In each study, animals were observed for up to 15 days after dosing.  Evaluations 
consisted of mortality, clinical observations, body weight, and macroscopic examination.  
The maximum non-lethal doses were 2000 mg/kg in mice and 700 mg/kg in rats when given as a 
single oral dose. With an intraperitoneal (IP) single dose injection, the maximum non-lethal dose and 
the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) were 20 mg/kg in mice and 70 mg/kg in rats. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat-dose toxicity of bosutinib was evaluated in rats in a 7-day oral (gavage) dose-ranging study 
(RPT-49310), two 1-month toxicity studies (1 with a 1-month recovery period) (RPT-52772; RPT-
57924), a 6-month toxicity study (RPT-63644), and in dogs in a 10-day oral (gavage) dose-ranging 
study (RPT-50039), 1-month toxicity study (RPT-52074), 2-week tolerability study (RPT-60569), and a 
9-month toxicity study (with a 1-month recovery period) (RPT-65542). 
These studies are summarised in tables 1 and 2.

In a 7 day dose ranging study in rats, bosutinib was administered by oral gavage at dosages of 0, 100, 
300, or 1000 mg/kg/day. Mortality occurred at ≥ 300 mg/kg/day as a result of poor clinical condition 
(including faecal alterations, dehydration, ataxia, decreased motor activity) and decreased body weight 
or body-weight gain and food consumption. At 100 mg/kg/day, bosutinib-related faecal alterations

consumption, and postmortem observations (intestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and 
liver) were not considered dose-limiting because they did not affect the overall health of the animals. 
In a 1 month oral toxicity study in rats, bosutinib was administered by oral gavage at dosages of 0, 10, 
30, or 70 mg/kg/day. Compound-related erythrocytosis and haemosiderosis were found in the 
mesenteric lymph node at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. However, these effects were not considered adverse 
because there was no macroscopic or microscopic evidence of haemorrhage in the GI tract and there 
was no compound-related decrease in parameters of red cell mass. Therefore, in this study, the NOAEL 
of bosutinib was 70 mg/kg/day, the highest dosage administered. 
In a second 1 month toxicity study in rats with a 1-month recovery period, bosutinib was administered 
by oral gavage at dosages of 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day. Mortality due to poor clinical condition 
occurred at 200 mg/kg/day; clinical observations in these animals were consistent with bosutinib-
induced gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. At 100 mg/kg/day, decreased body weight was associated with 
GI toxicity (sinus erythrocytosis and haemosiderosis of the mesenteric lymph nodes; goblet cell 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the small intestine; and mucosal hyperplasia of the caecum or colon). 
Based on the presence of decreased body weight and evidence of GI toxicity, the NOAEL was 
determined to be < 100 mg/kg/day. 
In a 6 month toxicity study in rats, bosutinib was administered orally (gavage) at dosages of 10, 30, or 
100/70 mg/kg/day. The high dosage of 100 mg/kg/day was lowered to 70 mg/kg/day in week 7 
because of mortality, the severity of clinical observations and the magnitude of decrease in body 
weight in this group. The cause of death was bosutinib induced GI toxicity, which was manifested as 
faecal alterations, debilitation, and body-weight loss in males (18%) and females (12%), as well as 
macroscopic (red mucosal foci, diffuse mucosal discoloration, abnormal contents, and/or distension of 
stomach and intestine) and microscopic (haemorrhage, erosion and oedema of the caecum and colon; 
haemorrhage, erosion, mixed cell inflammation and mucosal hyperplasia of the duodenum, jejunum, 
and ileum; and sinus erythrocytosis; and haemosiderin pigment in the mesenteric lymph nodes) 
findings in the GI tract in females. At dosages of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, there were no effects of 
bosutinib administration on body weight or food consumption. There was 1 death in a female at 30 
mg/kg/day on day 168. Although there was no macroscopic or microscopic evidence of GI toxicity, this 
death was considered possibly bosutinib related based on clinical signs. Intestinal lesions were 
observed at 10, 30, and/or 100/70 mg/kg/day (surviving animals), but were not adverse because of 
their slight to mild severity. Based on mortality and decreases (18% in males and 12% in females) in 
mean body weights observed at 100/70 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day in males. Based on 
the bosutinib related death in 1 female administered 30 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL in females was 10 
mg/kg/day.

In a 10 day dose-ranging study in dogs, 5 mg/kg/day was tolerated. At this dosage, bosutinib related 
faecal alterations (soft, mucoid, liquid, and/or containing red pigment) occurred but were not 
considered dose-limiting. At ≥ 37.5 mg/kg/day, dose-limiting emesis, faecal alterations, and/or body-
weight loss (0.5 to 1.1 kg) were observed and at 150 mg/kg/day resulted in cessation of dosing or 
elective euthanasia after 1 to 3 doses. In addition, red or brown discolorations of the mucosa in the GI 
tract and discoloration of the mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes were observed at 150 
mg/kg/day. 
In a 1 month oral toxicity study in fed dogs, bosutinib was administered by oral gavage at dosages of 
0, 0.5, 1.5, or 5 mg/kg/day. An increase in incidence and/or frequency of faecal alterations (mucoid, 
liquid, containing red pigment) occurred in males and females at ≥ 1.5 mg/kg/day. These clinical 
observations were not considered adverse because they were sporadic, transient, and infrequent; they 
were not associated with toxicologically meaningful decreases in body weight or food consumption, or 
with toxicologically meaningful alterations in clinical pathology, macroscopic, or microscopic 
parameters; and they did not affect the overall health of the animals; therefore, the NOAEL was 
5 mg/kg/day. 
In a 2 week tolerability study in dogs, bosutinib was administered at dosages of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day 
to further characterise bosutinib-induced toxicity and select dosages for future toxicity studies in dogs. 
Dose-limiting emesis, faecal alterations, decreased motor activity, and body-weight loss (up to 2 kg

compared with pretest) occurred at 20 mg/kg/day. The dosage of 10 mg/kg/day was tolerated with no 
dose-limiting effects. 
In a 9 month toxicity study in dogs, bosutinib was administered orally (gavage) at dosages of 0, 1, 3, 
or 10 mg/kg/day. Faecal alterations and/or emesis were observed at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day and 10 
mg/kg/day, respectively. The faecal alterations correlated with slight reductions in albumin (5% to 
28%) and total protein (2% to 20%) and, microscopically, with slight crypt abscesses in the 
duodenum. These findings were not considered adverse because they were sporadic, transient, and did 
not affect the overall health of the animals. Based on the absence of adverse effects at any dosage in 
this study, the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day, the highest dosage administered.

Carcinogenicity 
A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in S-D rats (60/sex/group). Rats  were gavaged once 
daily with 0 (distilled water), 0 (vehicle), 0 (vehicle), and males with 2.5, 7.5, or 25 mg/kg bosutinib 
for up to 91 weeks and females with 1.5, 5, or 15 mg/kg bosutinib for up to 100 weeks. Based on 
reduced survival in males at 25 mg/kg/day bosutinib, the dose level was decreased to 15 mg/kg/day 
on Week 78. Vehicle was a mixture of 0.5% methylcellulose (4000 cps) (w/v), 2.0% polysorbate 80, 
NF (w/v), 0.06% glacial acetic acid, NF (w/v) and distilled water. 
Neoplastic findings in treated groups were thyroid follicular cell tumours in males, pituitary tumours in 
males, skin fibromas in males and females, schwannoma in males, lipoma/liposarcoma combined in 
females and squamous cell papilloma/keratoacanthoma/ squamous cell carcinoma combined in 
females. These tumours although showing statistical significance compared to combined vehicle 
controls by trend analysis or pairwise comparison with Peto were however not considered treatment-
related. 
Overall, no relevant treatment related increase in neoplastic lesion was shown. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity of bosutinib was evaluated in rats and rabbits. These 
included studies on male and female fertility in rats and embryofoetal developmental studies in female 
rats and rabbits. A summary of the studies is given in the table below.

In  a  rat  fertility  study,  fertility  was  slightly  decreased  in  males.  In  females  increased  embryonic 
resorptions and decreases in implantations and viable embryos were observed. The dose at which no 
adverse  reproductive  effects  were  observed  in  males  (30  mg/kg/day)  and  females  (3  mg/kg/day) 
resulted in exposures equal to 0.6 and 0.3-fold, respectively, the human exposure resulting from the 
clinical dose of 500 mg. 
There  was  no  evidence  of  adverse  developmental  toxicity  in  rats  at  exposures  equal  to  0.5-fold  the 
human  exposure  at  the  500  mg  dose  (based  on  unbound  AUC  in  the  respective  species).  In  a  rabbit 
developmental toxicity study there were fetal anomalies observed (fused sternebrae, and two fetuses 
had  various  visceral  observations),  and  a  slight  decrease  in  fetal  body  weight.  The  exposure  at  the 
highest dose tested in rabbits (10 mg/kg) that did not result in adverse fetal effects was 0.7-fold that 
in humans at the 500 mg. 
Studies on pre- and postnatal development have not been conducted with bosutinib. Those studies are 
not  warranted  for  the  proposed  indication  in  the  treatment  of  an  advanced  cancer,  in  line  with  ICH 
guideline S9. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of bosutinib were evaluated as part of oral repeat-dose dose-ranging and pivotal 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, 
and in support of a mouse micronucleus assay and in a 2-week toxicity study with M2. 
Bosutinib exposure in rats and dogs, as defined by C max and AUC (0-24), increased with increasing 
dose over the dose ranges tested.  In studies with repeated daily administration, there were no gender 
differences in dogs.  For rats, systemic exposure of bosutinib in the 1-month and 6-month oral toxicity 
study was higher in females compared to males at all dose groups.  Exposure was generally increased 
at the end of the study compared to Day 1 exposure, although the accumulation was low to moderate 
in rat and dog plasma.  
Local Tolerance  
Specific local tolerance studies with bosutinib were not conducted. The oral local tolerance was 
evaluated in toxicological studies.

Other toxicity studies 
Bosutinib  was  not  found  to  be  phototoxic  in  rats  exposed  to  ultraviolet  radiation.    No  toxicities  were 
identified  for  the  M2  metabolite  and  RRT  0.99  impurity.  The  Applicant  appropriately  justified  that 
impurity RRT 0.99 does not have genotoxic potential and clarified that the level of this impurity in the

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Bosutinib was shown to inhibit the Src and Abl tyrosine kinase families with low nanomolar 
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell lines. Bosutinib also 
exhibited antitumour activity in the subcutaneous K562 CML model. Besides Src and Abl, bosutinib 
inhibits certain other receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and certain serine/threonine kinases 
which could have the potential to mediate other/additional adverse effects as already known from the 
approved inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. Safety pharmacology studies exhibited a potential 
for ventricular arrhythmias since QT prolongation was observed in in-vivo and in-vitro studies.  
The non-clinical safety program of bosutinib included single and repeated dose toxicity studies, genetic 
toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and phototoxicity evaluations. Safety studies were 
also performed on the major human metabolite M2 and the RRT 0.99 impurity. 
The primary target organ of bosutinib-related toxicity was the gastrointestinal tract and this 
demonstrated a steep dose-response relationship. Toxicity was characterised by luminal dilation, 
goblet cell hyperplasia of the intestinal tract, sinus erythrocytosis, haemorrhage, and erosion and 
oedema of the intestinal tract, with clinical observations of faecal alterations, loss of body weight and 
reduced food consumption. A further target organ was the liver, with hepatocellular hypertrophy 
accompanied by increase in liver weights. The exposures at the NOAEL were equal to the human 
exposure at the recommended human daily dose of 500 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity and 
hepatotoxicity are also common adverse effects in patients receiving bosutinib therapy.

Lymphoid atrophy in spleen lymph nodes and thymus occurred in rats. Although these effects were 
regarded as secondary to GI toxicity, a direct effect of bosutinib on immune function cannot be 
excluded due to the pharmacodynamic action of bosutinib on Src, Abl, and Tec kinase inhibition. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity studies showed impairment of male and female fertility in rats 
and foetotoxicity (reduced foetal weight, skeletal and visceral anomalies) in rabbits at exposures lower 
than the human exposure at the recommended human dose of 500 mg. In gravid rats, bosutinib-
derived radioactivity crosses the placenta and foetuses were exposed to bosutinib and/or its 
metabolites.  
Consequently, the SmPC indicates that Bosulif is not recommended for use during pregnancy, or in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Women of childbearing potential should be 
advised to use effective contraception and avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Bosulif. The SmPC 
also highlights that based on non-clinical findings, bosutinib has the potential to impair reproductive 
function and fertility in humans. 
In lactating rats, transfer of bosutinib-derived radioactivity through the milk to nursing litters was 
demonstrated, with a milk-to-plasma ratio of 8. The SmPC therefore indicates that a potential risk to 
the breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment 
with bosutinib. 
Specific local tolerance studies with bosutinib were not conducted. The oral local tolerance was 
evaluated in toxicological studies. The tolerance was appropriately evaluated in several studies further 
to IV and intraperitoneal administration of bosutinib which examined clinical, macroscopic and 
microscopic signs in the application site.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies conducted were adequate to support the marketing authorisation of bosutinib 
in the treatment of CML. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Within the phase I and II clinical development program for oral bosutinib 11 phase 1 studies were 
carried out with healthy subjects, and 1 phase 1 study was conducted in subjects with hepatic 
impairment; 8 studies were conducted in subjects with cancer. The biopharmaceutical clinical 
development program comprised 5 Phase 1 single-dose studies in healthy subjects under fasting and 
fed conditions.

Absorption  
Bioavailability  
Absolute bioavailability has not yet been studied.  
Bosutinib showed an absorption lag time of ~1 hour with the capsule formulation which was confirmed 
in population PK analyses regardless of formulation. Median t max was reached between 3-6 hours, 
indicative of slow absorption. There was no difference in t max between healthy subjects and cancer 
patients, nor between single and multiple dosing or fasted and fed state. 
Exposures between Cmax of 88 142ng/mL and AUC of ~2190-2970 ng*h/mL were observed after 
administration of 400-600mg in fed healthy subjects. For cancer patients the relative bioavailability 
was lower for low doses but being linear in higher doses, at least between 300-600mg. Between 200 to 
600 mg, bioavailability was within ±20% of the reference dose of 400 mg. 
Bioequivalence 
Several formulations of bosutinib capsules and film-coated tablets have been used during the clinical 
pharmacology development. Bioequivalence (BE) was shown for the capsule formulation, an oral 
solution and 3 potential commercial film-coated-tablet formulations at a 500-mg dose in the fed state. 
From comparison with in-vitro dissolution data it was concluded that the dissolution of the 
tablet/capsule would not be a rate limiting step in terms of bioavailability.  
A study in fasted state showed BE for AUC and Cmax for 3*100mg film-coated tablets (“clinical 
formulation”) versus the 3*100mg commercial formulation. However, due to the proposed therapeutic 
dose of 500 mg bosutinib in combination with food, a BE study in fed state comparing the 
500mg commercial tablets with 5*100mg clinical tablet formulation was requested in SA. In this study 
BE for AUC was shown, but the CI for Cmax was outside the acceptable regulatory ranges. As it was not 
pre-specified in the study protocol whether bosutinib might be regarded as a highly variable drug 
(intrasubject CV 30.7% for Cmax) and no replicate sampling design was used, a widening of the 
acceptance limits for bioequivalence was not foreseen. Two additional BE analyses were provided:  
1. Including 2 patients who had to be excluded according to protocol due to vomiting; with 
this, bioequivalence was calculated for AUC and Cmax.  
2. Without a subject with carry-over effect, AUC was still calculated within the BE limits and 
Cmax was further outside with ~128%.  
These results can be seen as supportive information.  
Dissolution profiles together with satisfactory results have been submitted with the response 
comparing the different (500 mg and 100 mg) commercial formulations and showing their similarity. It 
is now considered that BE between the 100-mg clinical tablet and commercial formulations has been 
unequivocally demonstrated in terms of both Cmax and AUC by means of study 3160A4-1120-US 
although the upper limit for BE was slightly outside regulatory ranges. The claim of a biowaiver for the 
lowest dosage of the commercial tablet was accepted. 
Influence of food 
Food has a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib. In healthy volunteers, AUC and Cmax 
increased 1.57-fold (95% CI: 1.42, 1.73) and 1.68-fold (95% CI: 1.47, 1.90), respectively, relative to 
fasting. The food effect was more pronounced with the lower dose of 200mg, where both parameters 
increased 2.3-2.5-fold. Volume of distribution and clearance were decreased in the presence of food by 
approximately 2-2.4-fold. Food also caused an increase in bosutinib tolerability.  
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 36/87 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Volume of distribution in fed healthy subjects for a 500mg dose was large and varied between ~4300 L 
and ~14300 L, suggesting extensive tissue distribution and/or low oral bioavailability. Apparent oral 
clearance ranged from 119 to 246 L/h after single ascending oral doses of bosutinib 200mg-800mg 
under fed conditions.  
Plasma protein binding of bosutinib was high with 94% in vitro and 96% ex vivo from healthy subjects 
from study 3160A4-1111-EU, with no difference between degrees of liver impairment. 
Elimination 
Metabolism 
In-vitro assessment in human liver microsomes and cryopreserved hepatocytes indicated that the 
predominant enzyme capable of metabolizing bosutinib was CYP3A4. The predominant in-vitro human 
metabolites by oxydechlorination (M2), N-demethylation (M5), and N-oxidation (M6) were compared to 
bosutinib in the nonclinical pharmacology Src enzyme assay and anchorage-independent Src fibroblast 
proliferation assay. All 3 metabolites had comparable activity in the Src enzyme assay, but cellular 
activity was approximately ≤5% of bosutinib activity. The two major metabolites (M2 and M5) were 
not pharmacologically and toxicologically active in non-clinical studies on rats.  
No metabolism of bosutinib was observed with cyclooxygenases CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, or 3A5. Flavin-containing monooxygenase enzymes (FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5) are capable of 
metabolizing bosutinib to its N-oxide metabolite but it was acceptably justified that a clinical DDI study 
with FMOs is not essential.  
The 2 main identified metabolites (M5 and M2) are formed in ratios of about 19% for M2 and 20-25% 
for M5 of bosutinib AUCT. Mean t ½ of M5 was observed by 37 hours, for M2 t ½ was 39 hours. 
Metabolite ratios were increased in fasting state as well as under CYP3A4 induction by rifampin. 
CYP3A4 inhibition by ketoconazole and increasing hepatic impairment reduced the formation of the 
metabolites markedly. 
Elimination 
Elimination was fast, with a mean recovery of almost 76% within 4 days and 95% within 9 days. Mean 
t 1/2 was about 32 hours for the 500mg dose, with longer observed t1/2 after lower doses (39 hours with 
200mg) or in the fasting state (41 hours with 200mg). 
In a mass-balance study with an oral 500-mg dose, radioactivity was mainly excreted in the faeces 
(91.3%) and to a minor extent in the urine (3.29%) within 10 days. The major components in faeces 
were unchanged bosutinib (40% of dose) and N-desmethyl-bosutinib=M5 (22%) while in urine 
bosutinib (72%) and oxydechlorinated-bosutinib=M2 (7.5%) were the major components. It remains 
as yet unresolved whether the >90% portion is excreted to a significant extent in bile i.e. whether 
bosutinib is subject to a high hepatic first-pass effect or is absorbed from the gut to a yet unknown 
extent, because the metabolites M2 and M5 are also formed by the cytochrome CYP3A4 in the gut 
luminal wall. The applicant acknowledged the possibility of bosutinib showing a high extraction ratio.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose linearity for AUC and Cmax was shown in healthy volunteers between 200 and 800 mg, and in 
cancer patients between 300-600mg, after single dose administration; it was less pronounced after 
multiple-dosing with higher variability. 
The recommended phase II and III doses were derived from 2 ascending-dose studies in cancer and 
2nd line CML patients and were dependent on the observation of DLTs. Most common DLTs were 
diarrhoea, and grade 3 rash and other grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicities in both studies. Due to these, 
the starting dose for part 2 of study 200-WW was 400mg, and the recommended phase III dose was 
500mg. 
Special populations 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the population PK analysis over 8 studies in healthy subjects, inter-subject variability (ω) and intra-
subject variability (σ) were calculated with 30.3 CV% and 19.3 CV% for AUC, and 31.6 CV% and 
26.3 CV% for Cmax, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In general, bosutinib exposures in patients with AMST and CML were within the range of values 
observed in healthy volunteers suggesting that there are no inherent differences in the PK of bosutinib 
between healthy subjects and cancer patients. 
From population PK analysis in cancer patients from 3 studies, pharmacokinetics can be described by a 
2-compartmental model with first-order absorption (t 1/2 1.14 hours) with an absorption lag (0.87 h). 
Simulations for the 500mg dose revealed the following calculations, however, the final model was 
characterised by high inter-individual variability(mean±SD):  AUC 5216±3316 ng/ml*h, 
Cmax 255±152 ng/ml, Cmin 180±126 ng/ml; CV of 64, 59, and 70%, respectively.  
For a 400mg-dose, the volume of the central compartment was about 4900 L (CV 48%) with an 
alpha-t 1/2 of 19 hours, the volume of the peripheral compartment was large (>380,000 L; CV of 211%) 
with a slow turnover (beta-t 1/2 290 days). CL/F was calculated with 120 L/h (CV 60%).  
Mean accumulation ratio (R) at steady-state ranged from to 1.9 to 3.1, which is consistent with a half-
life that is longer than the 24-hour dosage interval (Table 7).

Covariate analysis of bosutinib clearance and volume of distribution indicated that none of the 
covariates (age, weight, BSA, BMI, sex, race, protocol, ECOG, creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, ALT, 
AST, and albumin) exerted an effect on the PK of bosutinib. However, it was not excluded by the 
applicant in the response that older age or higher body weight may have contributed to longer 
elimination half-life, as was seen in a hepatic impairment study. Bilirubin level had small effect on 
clearance that was not considered clinically relevant. In addition, the results indicated that PK of 
bosutinib was not affected by tumour type or prior anticancer treatment. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of bosutinib was examined in 18 subjects without cancer 
with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B and C, respectively) and in 9 
matched healthy control subjects. Liver impairment showed a significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of bosutinib. Oral clearance was reduced by 45-50% and AUC was similarly increased 
about twice for all Child-Pugh stages. Cmax was 2.5-fold for Child-Pugh class A, 2-fold for CP B and 1.5-
fold for CP C. Tmax decreased from 4 to 1.5 hours. With declining liver function t 1/2 increased up to 
2-fold, half-life was longest in the C-P class B and C cohorts (113 and 111 hours, respectively), 
followed by the C-P class A cohort (86 hours) and then healthy subjects (55 hours). The observations 
were consistent with the finding that the concentrations of the metabolites M2 and M5 were decreased.   
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on bosutinib PK has not been explicitly evaluated. 
The applicant argued that based on the low (3%) excretion of bosutinib and its metabolites in urine 
observed in healthy subjects, it was unlikely that renal impairment would have significant effects on 
the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib.  
Reduced renal function (creatinine clearance ≥1.5 ULN) was an exclusion criterion in the phase II/III 
efficacy studies in cancer patients. As some patients had shown declining renal function and a trend of 
increasing AUC with moderate renal impairment compared to none or mild during study was seen, an 
evaluation of renal function was requested. This revealed that neither creatinine clearance nor hepatic 
parameters like ALT, AST, and bilirubin declined in relation to exposure or time of exposure of 
bosutinib. The SmPC was revised accordingly. 
Demographics 
Population PK analysis of 3 clinical studies in patients with cancer indicated that age, body weight, 
gender and race do not affect the PK of bosutinib. These results are consistent with results from 
population in healthy volunteers. However, in a Japanese population especially the low doses between 
100-300mg bosutinib led to exposures (Cmax and AUC) of up to >2-fold of those measured in a 
respective US study. Furthermore, the exposure vs dose-curves showed a steeper increase with the 
lower doses. The applicant confirmed they will discuss these observations when the final study report 
of the Japanese study 2203-JA is submitted.  
No studies in population below the age of 18 have been performed.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In-vitro data showed no effect of bosutinib as an inducer or inhibitor of the metabolic liver enzymes 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4.  
The applicant explained that genetic polymorphism of CYP3A4 is quite rare and that therefore a 
contribution to a different bosutinib/metabolite pattern affecting efficacy and/or safety can be regarded 
as minor. On the other hand, and in view of bosutinib possibly being a high-extraction drug, 
differences in expression levels of CYP3A4 might have a greater impact on the plasma exposures, 
safety and efficacy.  
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Addition of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased exposure 5.2-fold, 7.6- to 8.6-fold for Cmax 
AUCT and AUC, respectively, at a 100mg dose. Similarly, mean CL/F decreased approximately 9-fold to 
42L/h and mean V z/F decreased about 5-fold. Mean t 1/2 increased 1.5-fold to 69.0 hours.  
CYP3A4 inducers 
The CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin suppressed bosutinib exposure 7-fold for Cmax and 13-fold for AUC. 
Inversely, distribution volume and clearance were increased by the same ranges, respectively, 
resulting in shorter elimination half-life. The applicant stated that it is likely that the more profound 
relative effects on the parent drug as compared with metabolites are due to enhanced susceptibility of 
bosutinib to metabolism during first-pass absorption. The gastrointestinal tolerability of bosutinib was 
improved by concomitant administration of rifampicin (diarrhoea 18.2% combined vs 45.8% alone) 
and this was considered to result from reduced local and systemic bosutinib concentrations. 
Proton-pump inhibitors 
Bosutinib displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility in vitro. An effect of gastric pH-dependence was 
also seen with the concomitant proton-pump inhibitor lansoprazole, when bosutinib exposures 
(Cmax and AUC) decreased to 54% and 74%. 
P-glycoprotein 
Due to expected therapeutic plasma levels being below the IC50 values for enzyme inhibition, a P-
glycoprotein (P-gp) interaction or a possible effect of bosutinib on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs 
have not been studied. However, the presumed bosutinib concentration in the intestine is higher than 
the in vitro calculated IC50 and thus inhibition of intestinal P-gp by bosutinib may occur.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The underlying clinically relevant mutation in Ph+ CML is the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation that 
forms the BCR-ABL fusion gene, leading to expression of the oncogenic Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase.  
Bosutinib is a potent Src and Abl kinase inhibitor. Bosutinib treatment inhibits Bcr-Abl activity, 
including Bcr-Abl phosphorylation, phosphorylation of the Src family kinase Lyn, along with 
phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins such as CrkL and Stat5 at concentrations comparable 
to those necessary to inhibit CML cell line proliferation.  
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/87 
 
 
 
 
Bosutinib also inhibits most of the clinically relevant mutants of Bcr-Abl that lead to imatinib-
resistance, however it is ineffective against the T315I mutant. Unlike other Abl kinase inhibitors now in 
the clinic, bosutinib has minimal activity against the receptor tyrosine kinases c-Kit and PDGF receptor.  
Data from early studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients, however, did not show a trend of 
bosutinib to inhibit Src phosphorylation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Positive pre-clinical investigations on hERG channels and in-vivo animal models provided evidence for a 
proarrhythmic potential of bosutinib. Additionally, bosutinib belongs to a class of drugs where a 
potential pharmacological concern has been evaluated. In the CML studies patients with QTc >450ms, 
intake of QT prolonging medication or relevant cardiac diseases were excluded.  
From a thorough QT/QTc study a proarrhythmic potential of bosutinib as specified in ICH E14 note for 
guidance was not established. Liver impaired subjects had shown TEAEs with prolonged QTc intervals 
in 37%, the incidence increased with declining hepatic function, but single patient data did not 
establish a correlation to bosutinib plasma concentrations. An observation in study 200 was that 
19.4% of the CML patients with blast phase had QT interval changes >60ms and 4.8% had QTcB 
intervals >500ms. In accelerated phase, changes >60ms were seen in only 1.4% and in chronic phase 
in up to 3.7%. Unfortunately, none of the blast phase patients experiencing QT prolongations had 
concurrent plasma levels drawn to evaluate a PKPD-relationship, but the cardiac observations might 
have also been due to the underlying disease. Adequate information on the proarrhythmic potential 
was added in the SmPC. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
As could have been expected, the more advanced CML stages have a lower probability of MCyR or 
cumulative CHR response than observed in second-line CML patients. 
Differences in exposure metrics were similarly seen between responders and non-responders in 
3rd/4th line advanced CML as in 1st line patients. While the mean±SD and the maximal levels for AUC, 
Cmax and Cmin were comparable between the subgroups, minimal exposure levels in responding 
patients were 4.7-fold higher for AUC, 4.4-fold higher for Cmax and 5.7-fold higher for Cmin. Several 
patients had dose escalations to 600 mg bosutinib and experienced improved response after the dose 
escalation but it is not known whether the increased minimal exposures only represent such patients or 
whether the high PK variability of bosutinib had also resulted in such plasma levels in some responders 
taking 500 mg. 
From the 1st line data it had already been suggested that a certain minimal exposure to bosutinib could 
be an important prerequisite for efficacy. This has been confirmed in the advanced CML patient 
population. The dose escalation to 600 mg in case of insufficient response should therefore become an 
important standard in clinical practice. And monitoring of bosutinib plasma levels might be useful in 
case of (even early) unsatisfactory or failure of therapeutic response 
Genetic differences in PD response 
Pharmacogenomic analyses had been optional only and were not performed. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of bosutinib have been reasonably well studied in the phase I/II development 
program in adult healthy volunteers and cancer patients. 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report

The pharmaceutical formulation of bosutinib was changed several times during the clinical 
development program. Bioequivalence was established between the capsule and 3 film-coated tablet 
formulations, and was also demonstrated between the clinical film-coated tablet and the commercial 
tablet formulation by means of study 1120-US, together with the claim of a biowaiver for the lowest 
dosage of the commercial tablet. Up to now, the proposed commercial tablet formulation was 
administered as single-doses only in 3 bioequivalence studies with a very low number of subjects, and 
it was of concern that a higher diarrhoea incidence was reported compared to the clinical formulation. 
In a recently performed study with 24 Asian subjects an even higher incidence of diarrhoea (63%) with 
the commercial formulation and 53% with the clinical formulation was reported. From the current data 
no final conclusion can be drawn whether this observation was formulation dependent or might also be 
due to racial differences in susceptibility. The applicant indicated that the ongoing CML studies will 
have to change study drug from the clinical to the commercial formulation during 2013. Additional 
post-hoc analyses with regard to safety information for diarrhoea frequency will be provided to be able 
to better characterise the to-be-marketed formulation.  
The interaction with food has been satisfactorily studied and a significant increase in bosutinib 
exposure for Cmax and AUC by 1.6-1.7-fold with food was established, the effect being more 
pronounced at lower doses. However, tolerability was improved by food. The SmPC correctly describes 
the intake with food. 
The gastric-pH increase by proton-pump inhibitors was shown to reduce bioavailability up to one half. 
The interaction is correctly described in the SmPC. 
The absorption of bosutinib is slow and is linear between 300-600 mg. In cancer patients exposure was 
about 2-fold higher and Vz/F about 2-fold lower than in healthy subjects. Generally, the volume of 
distribution was large, thus suggesting extensive tissue distribution and/or low bioavailability. 
Elimination occurs via faeces to > 91% with a t 1/2 of 19 hours in cancer patients (34 hours in healthy 
subjects) after extensive metabolism by liver and/or GI CYP3A4, and only about 3% via urine. Hence it 
is suspected that bosutinib is subject to extensive first-pass-metabolism. This makes bosutinib 
susceptible to interactions with CYP3A inducers and inhibitors, and substantial changes in parent and 
metabolite pharmacokinetics were established. Consequently, sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC include 
warnings with respect to concomitant use of bosutinib with potent or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers.  
Patients with hepatic impairment showed about 2-fold increases of bosutinib exposure and elimination 
half-life. Hepatic impairment is included as a contraindication in the SmPC (see Discussion on Clinical 
Safety). 
In the absence of more convincing data so as to rule-out the possible inhibition of P-gp by bosutinib, a 
clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study using known P-gp substrates should be performed post-
authorisation. 
Absolute bioavailability has not been studied. The applicant will conduct a study as post-authorisation 
measure to address this issue. 
The effect of renal impairment on elimination had not been formally assessed. Though the renal 
excretion of bosutinib was low (around 3%) in the oral mass balance study, kidney impaired patients 
were excluded from the CML studies. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in CML patients a 
trend to increasing exposure (AUC) in patients with moderate impairment during studies was observed. 
This information has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. A study in patients with renal 
impairment is ongoing and results will be submitted as a post-authorisation measure.

A proarrhythmic potential of bosutinib cannot be ruled out, although the thorough QT study was 
negative, because in other studies QTc prolongations > 450 ms or > 60 ms from baseline were 
observed. A warning in this respect is included in the SmPC.  
From a pharmacodynamic point of view, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the inhibition of 
pSRC expression. 
For incidence and severity of diarrhoea a strong exposure-effect relationship was shown, a minor 
relationship was calculated for incidence of rash, nausea and vomiting. In the last line CML population 
a dose-dependent increased probability for rash was observed for responders but a lower probability of 
ATL/AST elevations compared to non-responders. 
From population PK analyses on exposure-efficacy relationships in both CML studies no clear pattern 
was identified. However, exposure-efficacy data separated into responders and non-responders 
revealed higher minimal plasma levels in responding patients in all treatment lines which might thus be 
regarded a certain prerequisite for efficacy of bosutinib. Final conclusions on the necessary and 
sufficient minimal levels cannot be drawn from the current data. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology data were adequately presented to support the application for a CML CP 
indication at a dose of 500 mg of bosutinib administered once daily with food.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
This application was initially submitted with Study 3160A4-3000-WW (hereafter named 3000 WW) as 
pivotal to support the authorisation of bosutinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP). The phase I/II 
trial, 3160A4-200-WW (hereafter named 200 WW) was submitted as supportive study. 
Further to review of the data (see results and discussion below), Study 200-WW became the main 
study to support of a last-line indication, with additional data from compassionate use programmes as 
well as from Study 3000-WW being supportive. 
Details of the two studies are given in the table below.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Evidence for bosutinib doses and dosing regimen used in Phase 2 and 3 studies was obtained in studies 
100-US in subjects with advanced solid malignant tumours (ASMT), study 200-WW in subjects with 
Ph+ leukaemias, and in Study 103-EU in healthy subjects. 
In Study 100-US, ASMT patients received bosutinib at doses of 50 to 600 mg. However, due to the 
number of Grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicities observed in the 500-mg lead-in cohort, 400 mg was 
selected as the recommended daily dose for Part 2 of Study 100-US. Based on this experience the 400 
mg dose was selected also as the starting dose in Part 1 of Study 200-WW. 
In the part I of this completed trial, 18 subjects total were enrolled, at dose levels of 400 mg, 500 mg 
and 600 mg. The applicant stated that sample size for Part 1 of the study was determined by clinical 
rather than statistical considerations, without further explanations. 
There were 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; grade 3 rash) and 2 “near” DLTs (grade 2 rash and grade 2 
diarrhoea) observed at the 600-mg dose level. As a result of this finding the 500-mg daily dose was 
selected to be taken with food as the recommended starting dose for patients enrolled in Part 2. As 
clinical efficacy was seen at doses of 500 mg in 200 WW and dose escalation to 600 mg resulted in 
distinctly more toxicity no more dose response studies were performed 
In conclusion, dose finding was obviously dominated by the toxicity observed and no formal dose 
finding was performed. This might be justified for a drug where exposure was limited due to very high 
rate of diarrhoea events and other adverse events observed above a dose of 400mg or 500 mg, 
respectively.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 200-WW 
Methods 
This pivotal study was an open-label, multicentre, 2-part, safety and efficacy study of bosutinib in 
subjects with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukaemia. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study 
in subjects with CP CML who were resistant/refractory to imatinib to establish the MTD in this subject 
population and determine a dose for part 2. Part 2 studied the efficacy and safety of bosutinib in this 
partially heavily pretreated population with more advanced disease stages. 
The post-hoc defined subpopulation of patients with a “high medical need” of this trial was pivotal for 
the applied last-line indication. 
Study Participants  
Part 1 of the study included patients with CP CML who were resistant/refractory to imatinib. Part 2 
studied the efficacy of bosutinib 500 mg daily in subjects with CP, imatinib-resistant/refractory CML, 
who had no prior Src, Abl, or Src-Abl inhibitor exposure other than imatinib. Part 2 also included 
exploratory cohorts of the following subjects: 
•  CP CML imatinib intolerant 
•  CP CML imatinib resistant/intolerant followed by dasatinib resistance 
•  CP CML imatinib resistant/intolerant followed by dasatinib intolerance 
•  CP CML imatinib resistant/intolerant followed by nilotinib resistance 
•  CP  CML  imatinib  resistant/intolerant  followed  by  nilotinib  resistant/intolerant  and  dasatinib 
(Imatinib + NI +/or D) (In this cohort, there was 1 subject who only received previous imatinib 
and nilotinib and no prior therapy with dasatinib; the subject was nilotinib intolerant). 
•  Advanced Ph+ leukaemia (AP CML, BP CML, Ph+ ALL) 
Treatments 
In Part 1, bosutinib once daily dosing was studied at 3 dose levels (400 mg, 500 mg, and 600 mg). 
Further to completion of Part 1, the 500-mg daily was the recommended starting dose for patients 
enrolled in Part 2. Dose escalations to 600 mg were permitted for subjects who had a suboptimal 
response to 500 mg provided they were not exhibiting toxicity. Dose reductions in 100-mg increments 
to a minimum dose of 300 mg daily were permitted for toxicity. 
 Objectives 
The primary objectives of Part 2 of the study were to: 
•  Determine the rate of attaining major cytogenetic response (MCyR) in subjects with imatinib-
resistant CP CML, who had no prior Src, Abl, or Src-Abl kinase inhibitor exposure other than 
imatinib 
•  Determine the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of this population (includes all 
subjects in Part 2)

-Evaluable Population: The evaluable population is defined as all enrolled subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of bosutinib and had an adequate baseline efficacy assessment. 
-All-treated Population: The all-treated population is defined as all enrolled subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of bosutinib. Note: Based on this definition, the all-treated population 
is also the population used in the safety analysis, which is referred to as the safety population. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 571 subjects were enrolled in the study; 570 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug 
(all-treated population or safety population). Of these 570 subjects, 18 subjects (400 mg: 3 subjects, 
500 mg: 3 subjects, and 600 mg: 12 subjects) participated in Part 1 of the study and continued into 
Part  2.  The  remaining  subjects  were  enrolled  in  Part  2  of  the  study  and  initiated  treatment  at  the 
recommended  starting  dose  for  Part  2,  as  determined  at  the  end  of  Part  1  (500  mg).  In  China,  3 
subjects with CP CML who met eligibility criteria for Part 1 were enrolled in Part 2 of the study. These 
subjects were to receive 400 mg of bosutinib, with safety and PK assessments performed as described 
per protocol for Part 2.

Following a 28-day period for safety assessment of the Chinese subjects, dosing at 500 mg of bosutinib 
could  begin.  Chinese  subjects  receiving  an  initial  dose  of  400  mg  were  eligible  for  dose  escalations 
based on the conditions described above. 
An overview of the number of subjects enrolled who received at least 1 dose of study drug and the key 
efficacy endpoints are summarised in the table below.

Key Efficacy Endpoints in study 200-WW 
Among  the  118  CP  CML  patients  in  the  all-treated  population  who  had  received  prior  imatinib  and 
dasatinib  and/or  nilotinib  and  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  bosutinib,  all  patients  had  received  prior 
therapy  with  imatinib  (resistant  or  intolerant)  as  first-line  treatment,  and  37 patients  were  dasatinib-
resistant,  50  were  dasatinib-intolerant,  27  were  nilotinib-resistant  and  1  patient  was  nilotinib 
intolerant.  Additionally,  3 patients  received  bosutinib  after  treatment  with  all  3  currently  approved 
TKIs:  2 patients  were  resistant  to  all  3 prior  TKI  therapies  (imatinib,  dasatinib,  nilotinib)  and  1  was 
intolerant of all 3 prior TKI therapies. 
In  the  CP  CML  all-treated  population  of  patients  treated  with  2  or  more  TKIs  (imatinib  and  1 or  both 
second-generation  TKIs  [third-line  treatment  group]),  the  median  duration  of  treatment  was 
8.3 months  (range  0.23  to  51.78)  and  the  minimum  follow-up  (i.e.,  duration  from  the  last  patient’s 
first  dose  to  database  snapshot)  was  13.4 months  as  of  the  28  March  2011  database  snapshot  and 
median duration of treatment was 8.6 months (range 0.23 to 60.82) and the minimum follow-up was 
approximately 25 months as of the 15 February 2012 database snapshot. 
In the advanced phase CML reference population of patients treated with 1 or more TKIs (imatinib only 
or imatinib and 1 or both second-generation TKIs) 76 patients were in accelerated phase (AP) and 64 
in blast phase (BP). Median duration of treatment in the advanced phase CML population was 
10.1 months (range 0.1 to 51.64) for AP CML patients and 2.8 months (range 0.03 to 44.24) for BP

CML patients.  The minimum follow-up was 12.3 months for AP CML and 18 months for BP CML 
patients as of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot. 
After a first line CP-CML indication for bosutinib based on study 3000-WW was assessed to be not 
approvable (for details please refer to “supportive studies”) also the second-line indication was 
precluded. According the relevant CHMP guideline-document a comparative study for bosutinib against 
the EU-approved second line TKIs (dasatinib and nilotinib) is necessary for approval.  
Insofar, only a last line indication for patients with CML and “Unmet Medical Need” could be discussed 
for an approval of bosutinib. In order to demonstrate efficacy and safety in this setting a post-hoc 
defined subpopulation of study 200-WW was selected for further assessment. 
Tthe following approach was used to identify patients with “Unmet Medical Need” in Chronic Phase and 
Advanced Phase (AP and BP) CML: 
Following imatinib failure, clinical practice guidelines (ELN) recommend treatment with a second-
generation TKI (dasatinib or nilotinib). There are, however, patients for whom either dasatinib or 
nilotinib may not be considered suitable treatment after failure of the other second generation agent 
due to a pre-existing medical condition, TKI intolerance, or mutation which would be expected to 
confer resistance to that therapy. In addition, there are patients who had received prior imatinib only 
for whom neither second-generation TKI agent may be considered a suitable treatment for the above 
referenced reasons.  These patients represent a population with a significant medical need. 
To identify these subpopulations, the Applicant conducted a review of the Study 200-WW CP CML and 
advanced phase CML reference populations, using the post-hoc selection algorithm as displayed in the 
table below. It includes the presence of a BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation that would be reasonably 
expected to confer resistance to dasatinib (F317, E255) or nilotinib (E255, Y253, F359) and expected 
to have sensitivity to bosutinib, or the presence of medical conditions or prior toxicities that may 
predispose the patient to unacceptable risk in the setting of nilotinib or dasatinib therapy (Table 10). 
These prior toxicities were selected based on adverse drug reactions associated with treatment with 
other TKIs.

Figure  1  -  Subpopulations  of  patients  with  an  unmet  medical  need  identified  and  reference 
populations of patients in Study 200-WW 
In conclusion, of the 52 patients identified, 36 patients were in the CP CML subpopulation (21 who had 
previously  received  2  prior  TKIs  and  15  who  had  received  1  prior  TKI).  And  there  was  also  a 
subpopulation of 16 advanced phase patients (5 AP CML and 11 BP CML patients) that failed treatment 
with either imatinib alone or imatinib in addition to one or both second-generation TKIs (dasatinib and 
nilotinib)  and  for  whom,  based  on  the  presence  of  co-morbidities,  a  history  of  TKI  intolerance,  or  a 
BCR-ABL  resistance  mutation,  the  remaining  approved  TKI(s)  were  not  considered  appropriate 
treatment options. 
Recruitment 
The study is ongoing. The study started on 18 January 2006 and was conducted in 26 countries 
(including 9 European countries). Interim data for the reference populations are based on the 28 March 
2011 database snapshot. Updated data as of the 15 February 2012 database snapshot were added for 
the major endpoints in the third-line CP CML reference population, including an analysis of efficacy by 
baseline mutation status. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 5 protocol amendments.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 571 subjects with Ph+ Leukemia  were enrolled in the study 200-WW; 570 subjects 
(including 24 with Ph+ALL) received at least 1 dose of study drug (all-treated population or safety 
population). Of these 570 subjects, 18 subjects (400 mg: 3 subjects, 500 mg: 3 subjects, and 600 mg: 
12 subjects) participated in Part 1 of the study and continued into Part 2. The remaining subjects were 
enrolled in Part 2 of the study and initiated treatment at the recommended starting dose for Part 2, as 
determined at the end of Part 1 (500 mg). 
The reference population with CML patients enrolled 546 subjects (24 subjects with Ph+ALL excluded). 
Among these patients, the applicant has identified in the included CP, AP, or BP CML patient a 
subpopulation with “unmet medical need” (n=52). To support the data in these subpopulations, results 
are summarised in the table below for the reference populations of CP and advanced phase CML from 
which the patients in these “unmet medical need” subpopulations were identified.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy for patients identified within the Phase 1/2 study population who failed either imatinib alone or 
imatinib  in  addition  to  one  or  both  second-generation  TKIs  (dasatinib  and  nilotinib)  and  for  whom, 
based  on  the  presence  of  co-morbidities,  a  history  of  TKI  intolerance,  or  a  BCR-ABL  resistance 
mutation,  the  remaining  approved  TKI(s)  are  not  considered  appropriate  treatment  options  was 
reviewed.  Of  the  52  patients  identified,  36  patients  were  in  the  CP  CML  subpopulation  (21  who  had 
previously received 2 prior TKIs and 15 who had received 1 prior TKI). 
Of  the  21  CP  CML  patients  treated  with  Bosulif  following  failure  of  imatinib  and  1  additional  second-
generation  TKI  identified,  9  of  these  patients  had  MCyR  or  better  including  2  patients  with  complete 
molecular response (CMR), 1 patient with major molecular response (MMR), 4 patients with CCyR, and 
2 patients with partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) and had a treatment duration exceeding 24 weeks. 
In addition, 7 other patients had a response of CHR on Bosulif treatment. Among the 9 patients with a 
response of MCyR or better, duration of MCyR ranged from 8 to 204 weeks with a treatment duration 
ranging from 35 to 215+ weeks. 
There  were  15  patients  who  received  imatinib  and  no  other  second-generation  TKI  who  met  these 
criteria.  Of  these  15  patients  with  “unmet  medical  need”  who  had  received  prior  imatinib  only,  9 
patients  had  a  response  on  Bosulif  treatment  of  MCyR  or  better,  including  3  patients  with  CMR,  1 
patient  with  MMR,  4  patients  with  CCyR,  and  1  patients  with  PCyR  with  a  duration  of  MCyR  ranging 
from 12 to 155 weeks and a treatment duration ranging from 24 to 197+ weeks. 
There  was  also  a  subpopulation  of  16  advanced  phase  patients  (5  AP  CML  and  11  BP  CML  patients) 
that  failed  treatment  with  either  imatinib  alone  or  imatinib  in  addition  to  one  or  both  second-
generation  TKIs  (dasatinib  and  nilotinib)  and  for  whom,  based  on  the  presence  of  co-morbidities,  a 
history of TKI intolerance, or a BCR-ABL resistance mutation, the remaining approved TKI(s) were not 
considered  appropriate  treatment  options.  Of  these,  4  of  the  5  AP  patients  had  notable  treatment 
duration  with  a  range  from  46  to  114  weeks  with  responses  including  CMR  (1  patient),  CCyR  (2 
patients)  and  major  haematologic  response  (MaHR)  (1  patient)  with  1  patient  still  on  treatment. 
Among  the  11  BP  CML  patients,  3  patients  remained  on  treatment  for  more  than  24  weeks  with 
notable  responses  (2  patients  with  a  CCyR  and  1  patient  with  a  MaHR)  and  a  treatment  duration 
ranging from 46 to 118 weeks with one patient still on treatment. 
Efficacy in the reference population of Study 200-WW are also presented in the table below. Number of 
patients  (N)  in  this  table  differs  for  the  different  endpoints  due  to  different  evaluable  populations  for 
the different endpoints.

Cytogenetic Response criteria: Major Cytogenetic response included Complete (0% Ph+ metaphases from bone 
marrow or <1% positive cells from fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]) or partial (1%-35%) cytogenetic 
responses. Cytogenetic responses were based on the percentage of Ph+ metaphases among >/= 20 metaphase 
cells in each bone marrow sample. FISH analysis (>/= 200 cells) could be used for post-baseline cytogenetic 
assessments if >/= 20 metaphases were not available. 
Overall haematologic response (OHR) = major haematologic response (complete haematologic response + no 
evidence of leukaemia) or return to chronic phase (RCP). All responses were confirmed after 4 weeks. Complete 
haematologic response (CHR) for AP and BP CML: WBC less than or equal to institutional ULN, platelets greater than 
or equal to 100,000/mm3 and less than 450,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.0 
x 109/L, no blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood, less than 5% myelocytes + metamyelocytes in bone 
marrow, less than 20% basophils in peripheral blood, and no extramedullary involvement. No evidence of 
leukaemia (NEL): Meets all other criteria for CHR except may have thrombocytopenia (platelets greater than or 
equal to 20,000/mm3 and less than 100,000/mm3) and/or neutropenia (ANC greater than or equal to 0.5 x 109/L 
and less than 1.0 x 109/L). Return to chronic phase (RCP) =disappearance of features defining accelerated or blast 
phases but still in chronic phase.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Not applicable. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies in special populations were performed in this explorative setting with a very 
heterogenous population. 
Supportive studies 
Compassionate use data 
Additional  supportive  data  was  provided  regarding  16  CML  patients  treated  with  bosutinib  in  the 
“compassionate  use”  setting,  in  which  bosutinib  was  provided  to  patients  with  no  alternative  TKI 
treatment  options.   Bosutinib  treatment  led  to  clinical  relevant  benefit  and  appeared  to  be  well 
tolerated in these patients with an “unmet medical need”. 
At least 10 of these 16 patients with no other TKI treatment option had a clinically relevant response to 
bosutinib.  All  patients  had  a  diagnosis  of  Ph+  CML  in  CP,  AP,  or  BP  and  patients  were  considered  by 
their treating physicians to have no other available or suitable TKI option. 
The  following  reasons  for resistance  and/or  intolerance  to  previous  TKI  therapies  are  summarised  for 
the 16 patients identified from the compassionate use program. All 16 patients received prior imatinib 
therapy, and 15 of the 16 also received both dasatinib and nilotinib. 
Imatinib 
Nine (9) patients discontinued imatinib due to resistance (IM-R), while 7 patients discontinued imatinib 
due to drug intolerance.  
Of the 10 IM-R patients, 1 patient received imatinib only, which was discontinued due to the presence 
of  a  new  mutation,  F359V.    This  mutation  ruled  out  both  imatinib  and  nilotinib  as  therapy  options, 
while  the  presence  of  recurrent  pleural  effusions  contraindicated  treatment  with  dasatinib.    For  the 
other 8 IM-R patients, specific reasons for resistance provided by the treating physicians included: 
• 
• 
• 
Primary resistance in 3 patients 
Progressive disease – loss of response in 4 patients 
Progressive  disease  –  presence  of  new  mutations  (F359V,  Y253H/E459K    and  “Various 
mutations” not specified, in 1 patient each) 
Drug intolerance associated with imatinib discontinuation in 6 patients included the following toxicities: 
rash/dermal  toxicity  (4  patients);  hepatic  and  renal  toxicity,  diarrhoea,  cytopenia,  stomatitis,  and 
severe  diarrhoea  with  weight  loss  (1  patient  each).    Notably,  5  of  the  6  patients  also  discontinued 
dasatinib and nilotinib due to intolerance.   
Dasatinib 
As  noted,  fifteen  compassionate  use  patients  received  dasatinib  as  a  prior  therapy  from  which  the 
majority discontinued due to drug intolerance (13 patients).  Resistance was reported as the reason for 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 56/87 
 
 
 
dasatinib  discontinuation  in  only  2  patients  with  the  following  additional  information  provided  by  the 
treating physician: 
• 
• 
Progressive disease -- loss of response in 1 patient 
Progressive disease – “various mutations” in 1 patient 
Drug intolerance reported for dasatinib in 13 patients included the following toxicities: pleural effusion 
(5  patients);  fever,  pain,  neuropathic  disorders,  skin  lesions,  allergic  reaction,  arthralgia,  throat 
tightness, interstitial pulmonary oedema and unspecified (1 patient each.) 
Nilotinib 
Fifteen  compassionate  use  patients  also  received  nilotinib  as  a  prior  therapy  and  resistance  was 
reported  as  the  reason  for  nilotinib  discontinuation  in  7  patients  with  the  following  additional 
information provided by the treating physician: 
• 
• 
• 
Primary  resistance  in  2  patients  (due  to  lack  of  molecular  response,  drug  was  no  longer 
reimbursable by payor, thus discontinued for 1 pt) 
Progressive disease -- loss of response in 3 patients 
Progressive disease – mutations in 2 patients (G250E and F359C) 
Drug  intolerance  was  reported  as  the  reason  for  nilotinib  discontinuation  in  the  remaining  8  patients 
and  included  the  following  toxicities:  cardiotoxicity,  myocardial  infarction,  LFT  elevations,  headache, 
rash and abdominal/back pain (1 patient each) and unspecified (2 patients).  
In conclusion, bosutinib treatment led to clinical relevant benefit and appeared to be well tolerated in 
at least 10 these patients with an “unmet medical need”. 
Study 3000-WW 
Study 3000-WW was a multinational, multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-arm phase 3 study 
to compare the efficacy and safety of bosutinib alone to that of imatinib alone in subjects with newly 
diagnosed chronic phase CML. 
Methods 
Study design and treatment 
After  screening,  eligible  subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  either  bosutinib  500  mg  per  day  or 
imatinib 400 mg per day. Randomisation of subjects into each arm was stratified based on Sokal score 
(low, intermediate, high) and geographical region. 
In both treatment arms, subjects were allowed to dose escalate to 600 mg as long as there  were no 
grade 3/4 or persistent grade 2 adverse drug reactions, and if at least 1 of the following conditions was 
met: CHR was not attained after 12 weeks of treatment, or MCyR was not attained after 24 weeks of 
treatment,  or  CCyR  was  not  attained  after  48  weeks  of  treatment,  or  the  subject  had  loss  of  CHR  or 
loss of CCyR. 
The  trial  enrolled  adult  subjects  ≥18  years  with  newly  diagnosed  CP  CML,  defined  as  having  a 
cytogenetic  diagnosis  of  Ph+  CP  CML  for  ≤  6  months.  A  total  of  250  subjects  randomised  to  receive 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 57/87 
 
 
 
 
bosutinib  and  252  subjects  randomised  to  receive  imatinib  comprised  the  ITT  population.  Three 
subjects  did  not  receive  study  drug  and  therefore,  the  safety  population  consisted  of  248  subjects 
treated with bosutinib and 251 treated with imatinib.  
Treatment 
In study 3000 WW, subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either bosutinib 500 mg 
once daily by mouth or imatinib 400 mg once daily by mouth. In both treatment arms, subjects were 
allowed to dose escalate to a daily dose of 600 mg, as long as there were no grade 3/4 or persistent 
grade 2 adverse events, and achievement of predefined efficacy endpoints was delayed.  
The  study  consisted  of  a  treatment  phase  and  a  follow-up  phase.  In  the  treatment  phase,  subjects 
were required to visit the clinic on weeks 1 (first day of treatment), 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and then 
every 12 weeks while the subject was on treatment. Subjects will remain on treatment until completion 
of  8  years  or  early  discontinuation  due  to  treatment  failure,  unexpected  toxicity,  death,  or  consent 
withdrawal.  Subjects  who  prematurely  discontinue  treatment  for  any  reason  prior  to  completion  of  8 
years  may  be  entered  into  the  follow-up  phase.  In  the  follow-up  phase,  subjects  are  contacted 
approximately every 3 months.  
Dose-escalation up to 600 mg was only performed in 10 patients in the pivotal trial (compared with 32 
patients  in  trial  200  WW).  This  might  reflect  the  both  the  product’s  efficacy  and  its  high  level  of 
toxicity.  
Objective and efficacy endpoints 
Study  3000-WW  was  designed  as  a  superiority  trial  against  imatinib  regarding  the  following  primary 
and secondary respectively exploratory endpoints: 
Primary endpoint: CCyR rate at 1 year based on ITT population. 
Short-term secondary endpoint: MMR rate at 1 year based on ITT population. 
Long-term secondary endpoints: Duration of CCyR based on ITT population (responders only), duration 
of MMR based on ITT population (responders only), time to AP/BP based on ITT population, EFS based 
on ITT population, Duration of CHR based on ITT population (responders only). 
Exploratory endpoints: time to response (CCyR, MMR, CHR), overall survival (OS). 
Data baseline and demographics 
With the exception of some imbalances regarding gender and race, the baseline characteristics of the 
study  population  (age,  height,  bodyweight,  ECOG  and  Sokal  risk)  were  balanced  between  the  two 
study arms. The same is true with respect to the characteristics of the prior cancer therapy.  
Efficacy populations 
There  were  3  populations  analysed  for  this  study:    the  intent-to-treat  (ITT),  safety,  and  evaluable 
populations. 
The evaluable population included all subjects who  were randomised, received at least 1 dose of test 
article, had no major violations and had an adequate baseline cytogenetic disease assessment (defined 
as  having  at  least  1  Ph+  chromosome  present  at  screening)  and  at  least  1  adequate  post  baseline 
cytogenetic  disease  assessment  (defined  as  having  at  least  20  metaphases  by  conventional 
cytogenetics  or  at  least  200  cells  by  FISH).  Subjects  who  experienced  disease  progression  or  death 
prior to week 12 (before the first post baseline cytogenetic assessment) were included in the evaluable 
population.  In  the  course  of  the  study,  due  to  different  causes,  a  number  of  patients  were  not 
analysed.

Results 
A  total  of  460  subjects  (219  bosutinib  vs  241  imatinib)  comprised  the  evaluable  population,  which 
included  all  randomised  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug,  had  no  major  protocol 
violations  determined  to  impact  efficacy  (e.g.,  concomitant  other  anti-cancer  therapy),  and  had  an 
adequate baseline and at least 1 adequate post baseline cytogenetic assessment. More subjects in the 
bosutinib arm (31 subjects) than in the imatinib arm (11 subjects) were excluded from the evaluable 
population. The most frequent reason for exclusion from the evaluable population in the bosutinib arm 
was no post baseline assessment (21 subjects).  
Outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint 
In the  ITT population, the CCyR rate at 1  year was  numerically higher on the  bosutinib arm (70.0%, 
95%  CI:  64.3,  75.7)  compared  to  the  imatinib  arm  (67.9%,  95%  CI:  62.1,  73.6),  however,  the 
difference did not reach statistical significance (2-sided p-value = 0.601 (CMH test, adjusted for Sokal 
score and geographic region). The adjusted odds ratio estimate was 1.10 (with the associated 95% CI 
of 0.74, 1.63). 
Superiority  with  regard  to  the  relevant  primary  endpoint  of  CCyR  in  the  bosutinib  arm  in  the  ITT 
population was not established.  
Furthermore, in the ITT population, the CCyR rate at 24 months was 57.6% (95% CI: 51.5%, 63.7%) 
in the bosutinib arm and  65.1% (95% CI: 59.2%, 71.0%) in the imatinib arm. The  cumulative CCyR 
rate  by  24 months  in  this  population  was  78.8%  for  the  bosutinib  arm (95%  CI:    73.7%,  83.9%) 
compared to 79.8% with the imatinib arm (95% CI:  74.8%, 84.7%).

Long-term  secondary  endpoints:  Estimate  the  duration  of  CCyR,  MMR  and  complete  haematologic 
response (CHR) 
In  the  bosutinib  arm,  97.5%  of  subjects  compared  to  95.9%  of  subjects  in  the  imatinib  arm  did  not 
experience  a loss  of  CCyR  or  treatment  failure  up  to  and  including  1  year  from  the  first  response.  In 
the  bosutinib  arm,  96.9%  of  subjects  compared  to  96.0%  of  subjects  in  the  imatinib  arm  did  not 
experience a loss of MMR or treatment failure up to including 1 year from the first response. Duration 
of MMR rate at 1 year was 97.1% in the bosutinib arm compared to 93.8% in the imatinib arm. In the 
bosutinib  arm,  98.5%  of  subjects  compared  to  91.4%  of  subjects  in  the  imatinib  arm  did  not 
experience a loss of CHR or treatment failure up to including 1 year from the first response. 
Analyses at 24 months were also provided: The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of maintaining 
derived MMR at 24 months was 95.2% (95% CI:  89.5%, 97.8%) for bosutinib compared with 96.6% 
(95% CI:  91.1%, 98.7%) for imatinib. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The phase III Study 3000-WW was initially submitted as pivotal to support the authorisation of 
bosutinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP).  
The  primary  endpoint  selected  was  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  given  in  the  relevant 
regulatory guideline document (Appendix 2 to the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal 
products 
in  man 
(CPMP/EWP/205/95 
rev. 
3) 
on 
haematological  malignancies; 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/520088/2008). Herein it is stated that complete cytogenetic response rate at 1 year 
is  an  acceptable  primary  objective  only  for  superiority  trials,  whereas  for  non-inferiority  trials, 
prolonged follow-up is needed prior to licensure and PFS is the preferred primary endpoint.  
The  pivotal  study  3160A4-200-WW,  which  was  a  well-designed,  open-label,  uncontrolled  efficacy  and 
safety  phase  I/II    study  of  bosutinib  in  Philadelphia  chromosome-positive  (Ph+)  leukaemia,  was 
performed to explore whether bosutinib has some efficacy in second and third line CP-CML-patients as 
well  as  in  some  of  those  with  more  advanced  CML  stages  (AP-CML  and  BP-CML).  This  study,  initially 
submitted as supportive to the claimed indication, became pivotal to the application.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
With respect to the posology, the effects of dose escalation to 600 mg bosutinib regarding efficacy and 
safety cannot be assessed from the information submitted. This has been reflected in the SmPC.  
Although  bosutinib  has  demonstrated  efficacy  in  the  intended  target  population  in  terms  of  attaining 
relevant  surrogate  endpoints  as  CCyR  and  MMR,  Study  3000-WW  failed  to  achieve  the  primary 
objective CCyR at 12 months and the updated analysis at 24 months showed that imatinib was actually 
numerically superior to bosutinib.  
Results for the short term secondary endpoints MMR in the ITT demonstrate significant superiority 
against imatinib only at 12 months, while at 24 months this superiority disappeared. As the primary 
endpoint was missed the relevance of this finding remains questionable. Due to the gate-keeping 
procedure defined and the lack of adequate control of the type I error level of 5% in the amended 
statistical analysis plan, any conclusion of robust superiority for the short-term secondary endpoint 
MMR, and in particular for the important long-term secondary endpoints, is deemed questionable, as it 
can be expected that many subjects will be censored until end of follow-up. 
Therefore, bosutinib could not be considered approvable for a 1st line indication in CML, although these 
data support that bosutinib is an active drug in CML and might also be efficacious in pre-treated 
patients at advanced disease stages.  
Instead, results of study 200-WW were considered as pivotal to support an indication of Bosulif in a 
last-line CML indication. In this study, efficacy was seen in the subpopulation of CP, AP, and BP CML 
patients who, based on clearly defined criteria, may not be candidates for treatment with at least 1 of 
the currently approved TKI due to intolerance, mutations, or comorbidities. Although these 
subpopulations were small, the efficacy is further supported by the results seen in the larger reference 
populations within Study 200-WW. 
In the CP CML subpopulations with “unmet medical need”, 9 of the 21 patients treated with bosutinib, 
following imatinib plus one additional TKI and for whom the remaining TKI was not suitable, saw 
notable responses (CMR, MMR, CCyR, or PCyR) associated with a treatment duration exceeding 24 
weeks. For these 9 patients, the duration of MCyR ranged from 8 to 204+ weeks and treatment 
duration ranged from 35 to 215+ weeks as of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot. In addition, 9 of 
the 15 patients with unmet need treated with bosutinib following imatinib failure only also experienced 
notable responses (CMR, MMR, CCyR or PCyR). As of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot, the 
duration of MCyR ranged from 12 to 155+ weeks and a treatment duration ranging from 24 to 
197+ weeks for these 9 patients. 
For the reference population of CP CML patients previously treated with both imatinib and either one of 
the second generation TKIs (dasatinib or nilotinib), bosutinib was associated with MCyR and CCyR 
being attained or maintained by 40.9% and 31.8% of patients, with a minimum 25 months follow-up. 
Clinical benefit is furthermore supported by the durability of these cytogenetic responses with 1-year 
and 2-year K-M estimates of maintaining MCyR of 74.0% and 70.9%, respectively. The durability of 
these cytogenetic responses is critical as the maintenance of response will necessarily minimise the 
risk of transformation to AP or BP with their attendant poorer prognosis. Accordingly, only 5 of the 117 
patients with a valid post-baseline haematologic assessment in the reference population experienced 
disease transformation to AP or BP CML while on bosutinib treatment. K-M estimates of PFS and OS at 
2 years were 75.1% and 84%, respectively, underscoring the clinically meaningful, long-term benefit 
obtained with bosutinib in this setting. These efficacy results were consistent with those seen 
previously in patients after a minimum of 12 months follow-up.

Moreover, bosutinib efficacy (MCyR rates, PFS and OS) was comparable in patients who had a 
mutation detected at baseline versus those without a mutation in the reference population and, of 
particular note, cytogenetic responses were noted in patients who had mutations which would be 
expected to impart clinical resistance to dasatinib and/or nilotinib (with the exception of T315I).  
Given that there are no TKIs currently approved for third-line therapy, comparative published data 
regarding the efficacy of nilotinib or dasatinib in this population are limited.  
Of the 5 AP CML patients in the “unmet medical need” subpopulation, 4 patients experienced notable 
responses (CMR, CCyR, MaHR) associated with a treatment duration ranging from 46 to 114 weeks. In 
the AP CML reference population, analyses of confirmed OHR and MaHR were attained or maintained 
by 55.1% and 46.4% of patients, respectively, with a 1-year K-M estimate of maintaining an OHR of 
80.0%. Furthermore, the 1-year K-M estimates of PFS and OS in AP patients were 64.9% and 76.0%, 
respectively. 
Blast phase CML presents a significant treatment challenge with short median survival even with 
imatinib treatment (6.5 months).  Of the 11 BP CML patients in the “unmet medical need” 
subpopulation who received more than 24 weeks of treatment, 3 showed notable responses (CCyR and 
MaHR) associated with a treatment duration ranging from 46 to 118 weeks. In the BP CML reference 
population, which also includes patients following failure with 1, 2 or even 3 prior TKIs, 28.3% and 
18.3% of patients attained or maintained OHR and MaHR, respectively, after bosutinib therapy. These 
haematologic response rates are clinically meaningful considering the highly refractory nature of BP 
CML. Among responders, the median duration of OHR was 31.5 weeks, thereby highlighting a subset of 
patients who exhibited a benefit with bosutinib, with some patients maintaining a response years 
beyond the expected survival of BP CML patients.  
In patients with BP CML treated with bosutinib, K-M estimates of median PFS and OS were 5.5 months 
and 11 months, respectively. Similar to the AP CML data, it is notable that these rates are comparable 
to PFS and OS data published for myeloid BP CML patients (6.7 months and 11.8 months, respectively) 
and lymphoid BP patients (3 months and 5.3 months, respectively), treated with dasatinib, the only 
second generation TKI approved for BP CML after imatinib failure, given that these latter patients had 
received imatinib as the only prior TKI therapy, as opposed to the bosutinib BP CML cohort which 
included more heavily treated patients (>1 TKI). The K-M estimates of PFS and OS at 1 year were 
14.4% and 43.8%, respectively. 
There was one patient, intolerant against all approved TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib), who 
achieved CCyR and MMR by Week 24 during bosutinib therapy and is still on treatment in study 200-
WW.  
Additionally, bosutinib has shown also similar clinical benefit in 10 patients in the “compassionate-use” 
setting, which included patients who had exhausted all available TKI therapies or for whom treatment 
with other available TKI(s) was deemed unsuitable by their physicians. 
Furthermore, in patients who discontinued a prior TKI due to pleural effusion, or who had a prior 
history of cardiovascular, diabetes, or hyperglycaemia events, bosutinib appeared to have an 
acceptable safety profile. 
However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  due  to  the  high  degree  of  cross-resistance  between  bosutinib  and 
dasatinib  or  nilotinib,  efficacy  is  mainly  seen  in  patients  with  intolerance  to  the  approved  TKIs.  From 
the information submitted it can be concluded that patients with CP CML who have F317L and E255V 
mutation (both reported to confer resistance to dasatinib therapy), may respond to bosutinib. But from 
10 evaluable patients with dasatinib resistance, only 1 patient (11.1%) with CML harbouring a F317L 
BCR-ABL mutation attained / maintained a MCyR until last analysis dated 15 February 2012. A better 
efficacy was observed in patients with some mutations which have been previously reported to confer 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 62/87 
 
 
 
nilotinib resistance (Y253H, F359C/V). From 12 patients with these mutations, seven patients (58.3%) 
attained/maintained a MCyR with bosutinib. However, for the E255K/V mutation neither bosutinib nor 
nilotinib or dasatinib seemed to be efficacious. 
Additionally, it is noted that in the subpopulation with “unmet medical need”, 2 patients with mutations 
that would reasonably be expected to confer resistance to subsequent dasatinib therapy experienced at 
least some disease response on bosutinib.  
In conclusion, bosutinib has demonstrated to have benefits in some patients treated in the last line, 
who had exhausted all available TKI therapies or for whom treatment with other available TKI(s) was 
deemed unsuitable by their physicians. It is noted that patient with pre-existing resistance against 
imatinib or dasatinib or nilotinib, respectively, had a significantly worse outcome than those with 
intolerance to these TKIs. However, this finding can be expected due to the differences in the clinical 
course of the disease, the high degree of cross-resistance between these second generation TKIs and 
the general prognostic impact of resistance in CML. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
As  indicated  above,  there  is  a  lack  of  approved  and  standard  of  care  pharmacological  treatment  for 
adult  patients  with  chronic  phase  (CP),  accelerated  phase  (AP),  and  blast  phase  (BP)  Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered 
appropriate treatment options. Insofar, there is an unmet medical need in this patient population that 
could be fulfilled with the proposed medicinal product. 
Information is currently only available from a post-hoc defined population of 52 patients and some 
additional patients from the compassionate use programme. Therefore, additional efficacy data is 
needed in the context of a conditional MA in order to confirm the benefit of bosutinib in the intended 
indication. 
Additional  comprehensive  clinical  data  can  be  provided  from  a  clinical  study  in  the  approved  target 
population.  The  applicant  should  conduct  a  single-arm  open-label,  international,  multi-centre  efficacy 
and safety study of bosutinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous 
leukaemia  (Ph+  CML)  previously  treated  with  one  or  more  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom 
imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered  appropriate  treatment  options  as  a  specific 
obligation for approval.  
Approximately  150  patients  should  be  enrolled  primarily  at  large  medical  centres  in  Europe  and  the 
United States, up to 75 patients are expected to be treated in the 4th or later line setting. 
The estimate probability of Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) (chronic phase) and Confirmed Overall 
Haematological  Response  (OHR)  (accelerated  and  blast  phase)  by  one  year  is  proposed  as  primary 
endpoint. Efficacy data will be collected at regularly scheduled time-points at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in 
the  different  CML  patient  populations.  The  use  of  a  centralized  efficacy  endpoint  and  mutation 
assessment was recommended. 
It  is  expected  that  this  study  will  further  support  the  efficacy  of  bosutinib  in  the  intended  last-line 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  phase  (CP),  accelerated  phase  (AP),  and  blast  phase  (BP) 
Philadelphia  chromosome positive  chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia  (Ph+  CML)  previously  treated  with 
one  or  more  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not 
considered appropriate treatment options.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Bosutinib is a second generation TKI that binds the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl, which is characteristic for 
Ph+ CML, in an intermediate conformation thereby inhibiting Abl kinase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 
1 nM. In cell lines transfected with both wild type and imatinib-resistant mutant BCR-ABL it suppresses 
proliferation. In imatinib-sensitive CML cell lines, the in-vitro inhibitory activity of bosutinib is up to 100 
fold that of imatinib, with IC50 values ranging from 1 to 20 nM. In imatinib-resistant cell lines (with or 
without mutations) bosutinib inhibited proliferation up to 114 fold that of imatinib. Bosutinib has been 
shown to inhibit phosphorylation of various signalling proteins and downstream substrates of Bcr-Abl, 
most notably the transcription factor Stat5 and the docking protein CrkL. 
Although bosutinib has demonstrated some efficacy in the initially intended first line CP-CML population 
in terms of attaining relevant surrogate endpoints as CCyR and MMR, the initially pivotal study 3000-
WW failed to achieve the primary objective CCyR at 12 months and the updated analysis at 24 months 
showed that imatinib was actually numerically superior to bosutinib.  
As  according  the  relevant  CHMP  guideline  a  second-line  treatment  can  only  be  approved  with 
comparative  data  using  one  of  the  two  approved  product  for  this  indication  (dasatinib  and  nilotinib), 
efficacy  of  bosutinib  was  then  assessed  to  approve  a  last-line  indication  “for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  chronic  phase (CP),  accelerated  phase (AP),  and  blast  phase (BP)  Philadelphia 
chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) previously treated with one or more 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  (TKIs)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  or  dasatinib  are  not  considered 
appropriate treatment options”.  
Efficacy  in  this  last  line  indication  derived  from  analyses  of  a  post-hoc  defined  subpopulation  of  the 
pivotal  study  200-WW,  which  was  an  open-label,  uncontrolled  efficacy  and  safety  phase  I/II  study  of 
bosutinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukaemia. It was performed to explore whether 
bosutinib has some efficacy in second and third line CP-CML-patients as well as in some of those with 
more advanced CML stages (AP-CML and BP-CML).  
In  this  study,  efficacy  was  seen  in  the 52  patient  unmet  need  cohort  [36 were  in  chronic  phase  CML 
(21  who  had  previously  received  2  prior  TKIs,  and  15  who  had  received  1  prior  TKI)  and  16  were  in 
advanced  phases  of  CML  (AP  and  BP)]  and  the  overall  reference  population  of  Study  200-WW. 
Although the subpopulations identified were small, the efficacy is further supported by the results seen 
in  the  larger  reference  populations  within  Study 200-WW.  Data  from  patients  in  compassionate  use 
programmes also support the evidence of efficacy of bosutinib in this last-line indication. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
To conduct a single-arm open-label, multi-centre efficacy and safety study of bosutinib in 
patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) 
previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom imatinib, 
nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. 
o  Submission of protocol: 30 May 2013 
o  Final clinical study report: 30 September 2018 
The benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of Bosutinib outweighs the risk 
in the fact that additional data are still required.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety  data  in  previously  treated  subjects  with  Ph+  leukaemia  is  available  from  Study  200-WW 
(bosutinib n=570). Relevant clinical safety data, including long-term safety, are also available from the 
Phase  III  Study  3000-WW  in  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  CP  CML  (bosutinib  n=248/  imatinib 
N=251).  
Other  safety  data  was  presented  from  phase  I/II  studies  conducted  in  patients  with  solid  tumours 
(mainly  breast  cancer).  In  total,  1572 subjects  were  exposed  with  bosutinib  in  clinical  studies  from 
phase I to III and 1209 patients received at least 1 dose of oral bosutinib alone or in combination with 
another anticancer agent.  
In study 3000-WW median duration of exposure was 16.5 months in the up-dated analysis for 
bosutinib and 16.75 months for imatinib, respectively. A further updated analysis after 24 months has 
been provided to assess long-term safety during the study. The dose intensity was lower for bosutinib 
compared to imatinib (87.3% versus 97.5%). Dose escalation up to 600 mg (foreseen in both arms if 
tolerated) was rare in the bosutinib group (3.6% versus 12.0% for bosutinib and imatinib, 
respectively).  
Adverse events  
In Study 200-WW all 118 patients treated in third line had at least 1 TEAE as of the 28 March 2011 as 
presented in the table below. As of the 15 February 2012 database snapshot, there was 1  new  TEAE 
with  a  ≥20.0%  incidence:  abdominal  pain  was  reported  in  24 (20.2%)  patients  compared  with  23 
(19.5%) patients reported in the Study 200-WW CSR. There were no new Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with a 
≥10.0% incidence.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In Study 200-WW, 35 (29.7%) of the patients had SAEs as of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot. 
However, in the population of “high medical need” more SAEs were observed. In total 28 (53,8%) of 
the  included  patients  had  SAEs.  This  is  explained  at  least  partially  due  to  inclusion  of  more  heavily 
pretreated patients and more advanced stages of CML. 
The  most  common  SAEs  (≥2%  incidence)  were  pleural  effusion  in  4 (3.4%) patients,  and  headache 
and neutropenia each in 3 (2.5%) patients. As of the 15 February 2012 database snapshot, there were 
no new SAEs with a ≥2% incidence.  
Overall,  the  incidence  and  types  of  SAEs  appeared  to  be  consistent  and  comparable  with  the  data 
previously  reported  from  study  3000-WW,  where  the  number  of  subjects  with  SAEs  was  significantly 
higher  in  the  bosutinib  arm  (68  subjects;  27.4  %),  compared  with  the  imatinib  arm  (37  subjects; 
14.1%) [updated analysis from 15 November 2011]. SAEs considered to be related to treatment were 
also  more  frequent  in  the  bosutinib  arm  (32  subjects;  12.9%)  compared  with  the  imatinib  arm  (13 
subjects;  5.1%).  Also,  SAEs  in  the  bosutinib  arm  led  more  frequently  to  treatment  discontinuation 
(13 subjects, 19.1 %) compared with the imatinib arm (3 subjects, 8.1%). However, SAEs leading to 
death occurred more often in the imatinib arm (7 subjects, 18.9%) compared with the bosutinib arm 
(3 subjects, 4.4%). The updated analysis at 24 months in general has confirmed these results.  
The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  (≥2%)  in  subjects  receiving bosutinib  were  diarrhoea  (9 subjects, 
3.6%),  ALT  increased  (7  subjects,  2.8%),  pneumonia  (6 subjects,  2.4%)  and  AST  increased  and 
pyrexia, (5 subjects, 2.0% each). 
The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  (≥2%)  in  subjects  receiving  imatinib  were  anaemia  (6  subjects; 
2.4%; Grade 3+4) and thrombocytopenia (6 subjects; 2.4 %; all Grade 4).  
Infection TEAEs and SAEs occurred more often in bosutinib subjects (40.7%) than in imatinib treated 
subjects  (31.1%).  There  was  no  association  between  TEAEs  of  infection  and  Grade  3  or  Grade  4 
neutropenia  in  either  treatment  arm.  No  deaths  due  to  an  infection  TEAE  were  reported  in  either 
treatment arm. 
In 2 subjects in the bosutinib arm of study WW3000 a Grade 4 SAE due to a drug-related anaphylactic 
reaction  was  observed.  One  patient  (015436)  experienced  anaphylactic  shock  after  administration  of 
the  first  bosutinib  dose.  The  other  patient  (011677)  experienced  anaphylactic  shock  after  being  on 
treatment  for  56  days;  this  subject  had  an  anaphylactic  response  to  bosutinib  after  a  treatment 
interruption for a separate TEAE and on Day 1 of the rechallenge experienced anaphylaxis to bosutinib. 
Administration  of  bosutinib  was  discontinued  for  both  subjects  and  both  recovered  completely  under 
supportive  care.  Anaphylactic  reactions  have  not  been  reported  in  any  other  clinical  study  with 
bosutinib.

Deaths 
As summarised in the table below, overall, 22 (19%) patients of the high medical need population in 
study 200-WW died during the study, which included the 2-year follow-up period after discontinuing 
treatment with bosutinib as of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot.

As of the 15 February 2012 database snapshot, there was 1 new death in the study.  One (1) patient, 
in  the  dasatinib-intolerant  cohort,  died  because  of  an  unrelated  AE  (severe  heart  failure)  123  days 
after the last dose of bosutinib, after having received bosutinib for over 3 years. 
In  the  52  patients  of  the  subpopulation  with  unmet  medical  need,  no  treatment-related  deaths  were 
observed during the study. 
Mortality (in total 16 subjects of 499) was relatively low in Study 3000-WW. This can be expected in 
the intended first-line population of subjects with newly diagnosed CP-CML. Fewer deaths occurred in 
the  bosutinib  arm  (7/249)  in  comparison  with  the  imatinib  arm  (13/251).  Most  of  the  deaths  were 
related to disease progression and no deaths have been observed as consequence of drug-related SAEs. 
As the study was not powered to detect difference in mortality, no conclusion can be drawn. 
Other significant events 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Of  the  681  (78%)  patients  that  experienced  diarrhoea,  665  patients  had  drug-related  events  of 
diarrhoea and 8 patients discontinued bosutinib due to this event. Concomitant medicines were given 
to  treat  diarrhoea  in  461  (68%)  of  patients.  The  maximum  toxicity  of  diarrhoea  was  Grade  1  or  2  in 
89% of patients, Grade 3 in 11% of patients; one patient (<1%) experienced a Grade 4 event. Among 
patients  with  diarrhoea,  the  median  time  to  first  event  was  2  days  (range,  1  to  594  days)  and  the 
median duration of any grade of diarrhoea was 2 days (range, 1 to 910 days).

Among the 681 patients with diarrhoea, 104 patients (15%) were managed with treatment interruption 
and of these 98 (94%) were rechallenged with bosutinib. Of those who were rechallenged, 95 (97%) 
did  not  have  a  subsequent  event  or  did  not  discontinue  bosutinib  due  to  a  subsequent  event  of 
diarrhoea. 
Cardiac disorders 
Three  patients  (0.3%)  experienced  QTcF  interval  prolongation  (greater  than  500 ms).  Eight  (0.9%) 
patients,  including  2  of  those  with  QTcF  interval  prolongation  of  greater  than  500  ms,  experienced 
QTcF increase from baseline exceeding 60 ms.  
Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity drug-related grade 3 or grade 4 TEAEs were reported for 11 subjects (1.3%).  Grade 3 
or grade 4 drug hypersensitivity was reported to be drug related for 5 subjects; all reports of grade 3 
or  grade 4  urticaria  and  anaphylactic  shock  were  considered  to  be  drug  related.  Anaphylactic 
or hypersensitivity reactions may also be due to macrogol (polyethylene glycol) 3350, poloxamer 188, 
povidone or to any of the excipients. This has been reflected in a contraindication (see SmPC, section 
4.4). 
Laboratory findings 
In  the  population  of  study  200-WW  on-therapy  clinical  laboratory  test  results  for  events  of  special 
interest  (ALT,  AST,  and  lipase,  total  bilirubin,  and  glucose  elevations,  and  low  phosphorus, 
haemoglobin, ANC, and platelet count) are summarised in the table below.

As of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot, the majority of patients reported laboratory abnormalities 
at  a  maximum  toxicity  of  Grade 1  or  Grade  2.  Clinical  chemistry  values  reported  at  a  Grade  3 
maximum toxicity in ≥5% of patients during treatment were elevated ALT and elevated lipase each in 
7 (5.9%)  patients.    There  were  no  clinical  chemistry  values  of  Grade  4  maximum  toxicity  in  ≥5%  of 
patients during treatment.  
Haematologic  laboratory  abnormalities  continue  to  represent  the  most  common  potential  clinical 
important  Grade  3/4  laboratory  abnormalities.  Haematology  values  reported  at  a  Grade 3  maximum 
toxicity  in  ≥5%  of  patients  during  treatment  were  low  platelet  count  in  17 (14.4%)  patients  and  low 
ANC  in  10  (8.5%)  patients.  Haematology  values  reported  at  a  Grade  4  maximum  toxicity  in  ≥5%  of 
patients during treatment were low ANC and low platelet count each in 13 (11.0%) patients, and low 
haemoglobin in 6 (5.1%) patients. 
Although all reported SAEs of increased AST/ALT in the bosutinib arm are resolved, the high incidence 
of  liver-related  TEAEs  and  liver-enzyme  elevation  observed  for  bosutinib  in  the clinical  studies  has  to 
be noted. Despite the observed abnormalities in liver function tests, there were no cases of permanent 
hepatic injury and no liver-related deaths in CML patients treated with bosutinib ( confirmed again also 
by the 15 February 2012 database snapshot). It seems that as in study 3000-WW the majority of liver 
toxicities were transient laboratory elevations, and were generally managed with dose modifications. 
However,  in  study  2207-WW,  a  Phase  2  study  in  metastatic  breast  cancer,  two  subjects  fulfil  the 
criteria  for  so  called  “Hy’s  law”  indicating  intolerable  hepatotoxicity  for  a  drug.  As  these  events  were 
observed  in  a  completely  different  target  population  in  which  the  disease  itself  as  well  as  the 
combination  with  letrozole  might  have  had  an  additional  effect  on  liver  function  and  no  further  cases 
were observed during the other clinical studies.  
Safety in special populations 
No  formal  analyses  for  the  PH+  leukaemia  trials  were  performed  to  compare  the  TEAE  data  on  the 
basis  of  age,  sex  or  race.  However,  subgroup  analyses  were  provided  to  allow  some  descriptive 
comparisons of results concerning age, gender and race. 
No consistent trends with regard to special populations were observed. Exposure in special populations 
was  limited.  There  were  no  subjects  under  the  age  of  18  years  participating  in  the  pivotal  study  and 
the number of subjects ≥ 65 years old were rather small, n = 28 (11.3 %) in the bosutinib group and n 
= 26 (10.4%) in the imatinib group.  
Phase I data suggests that renal impairment is not likely to have a significant impact on bosutinib’s PK. 
However, as subjects with Creatinine >1,5 ULN were excluded from the phase III studies confirmative 
information from these trials is absent.

Patients with hepatic impairment had an increased exposure as characterised in phase I study 3160A4-
1111-EU and additionally a high rate of QTc-time prolongation related to drug exposure. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to decrease bosutinib’s bioavailablity. . When a single 
oral dose of bosutinib (400 mg) was co-administered with multiple-oral doses of lansoprazole (60 mg) 
in  a  study  of  24  healthy  fasting  subjects,  bosutinib  Cmax  and  AUC  decreased  to  54%  and  74%, 
respectively,  of  the  values  seen  when  bosutinib  (400 mg)  was  given  alone  (see  Pharmacokinetic 
interaction studies). 
The  most  frequently  used  concomitant  medications  in  the  bosutinib  arm  of  study  3000-WW  were 
antidiarrhoeal agents (48.0%); antacids (39.9%), antigout preparations (primarily allopurinol, 38.3%), 
analgesics  (36.3%),  and  systemic  antibacterials  (35.5%).  For  subjects  receiving  imatinib,  the  most 
frequently  used  concomitant  medications  on  study  treatment  were  antigout  preparations  (primarily 
allopurinol)  (41.0%),  analgesics  (30.7%),  antibacterials  and  antacids  (28.7%  each),  and  anti-
inflammatory and antirheumatic products (25.5%).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study 200-WW, 84 (71.2%) patients within this reference CP CML population discontinued study 
drug as of the 28 March 2011 database snapshot.  The primary reasons for discontinuation of bosutinib 
treatment are summarised in the table below.

In  the  updated  database  snapshot  from  15  February  2012,  6  additional  patients  discontinued 
treatment.  Primary reasons for discontinuation included patient request (3 patients), AE (2 patients), 
and investigator request (1 patient).  The most common primary reasons for treatment discontinuation 
continue to be AEs (21.8%), unsatisfactory response (21.0%), and disease progression (16.8%). Two 
(2) patients who discontinued treatment because of thrombocytopenia and 1 patient each because of 
diarrhoea,  anemia,  myocardial  infarction (MI),  and  disease  progression.  Overall,  the  incidence  and

snapshot: 28MAR11   
In Study 3000-WW, AEs that led to the permanent discontinuation of the study drug were thrice more 
reported for in the bosutinib treatment arm (n=54 /21.8%) than in the imatinib arm (n=16 / 6.4%). A 
similar unfavourable relation was seen for dose interruptions and dose reduction for bosutinib. These 
findings confirm a critical safety profile for bosutinib compared with imatinib, which also seems to 
preclude any first-line administration in CP-CML.  
In conclusion, it seems that discontinuation due to safety issues as reflected by discontinuation due to 
AEs which was observed in about 22 % of the bosutinib treated patients in both main studies. Thus, 
the difference between both populations is only small. 
Post marketing experience 
Bosutinib has been recently approved in the United Stated on 4 September 2012 for the treatment of 
adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior 
therapy. However, no post-marketing data is available to date. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In accordance with signals derived from non-clinical studies, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal effects and 
cardiac arrhythmias were the most important toxicities associated with bosutinib.  
Toxicity in comparison with imatinib was too pronounced to justify the use of this product in the first-
line  indication,  particularly  as  superiority  in  efficacy  was  not  demonstrated  in  Study  3000-WW  and  a 
direct  comparison  with  other  second-generation  TKIs  approved  for  first-line  CP-CML  patients  is  not 
possible based on the available data. 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report

The  most 
common  TEAEs 
included  gastrointestinal  events 
(predominantly  diarrhoea), 
myelosuppression  (mainly  thrombocytopenia)  and  transaminase  elevations  (particularly  ALT).  The 
most common TEAEs in the subpopulations reflecting the recommended indication were also the most 
common TEAEs in the broader safety population. 
In the pivotal Study 200-WW, the safety profile of bosutinib seemed manageable and generally similar 
across  all  CML  reference  populations  (CP,  AP,  and  BP).  Interestingly,  patients  who  had  a  history  of 
pleural  effusion  or  of  discontinuation  of  treatment  with  a  previous  TKI  due  to  this  event  appeared  to 
have minimal cross-intolerance with bosutinib treatment.  
Diarrhoea was identified consistently as dose dependent and dose limiting for bosutinib. In Study 
3000-WW the rate of drug-related diarrhoea in the bosutinib arm (B: 65.7% versus I: 17.9%) was 
very high. Most cases were of short duration (median:3 days) and started early. However, there is also 
a relevant subgroup of patients (N= 77 subjects (45.8%) out of 168 with this AEs) that had longer 
lasting diarrhoea (>28 days, range 1 to 466 days). An additional post-hoc analysis with regard to 
safety information for diarrhoea frequency will be provided in order to better characterise the 
formulation to be marketed (see Risk Management Plan).  
In Study 3000-WW, a high rate of drug-related vomiting (B: 31.5% versus I: 13.5%) was reported. A 
higher  rate  of  arrhythmia  events  in  bosutinib  treated  patients  was  also  observed  (B:  8.6  %  versus 
I:6.5%). Hypokalaemia may enhance this effect. A warning with respect to the proarrhythmic potential 
of bosutinib is included in the SmPC. 
As  with  other  TKI  therapies  for  CML,  myelosuppression  events,  including  those  of  higher  severity 
(Grade 3 or 4) were prevalent; however, they were also manageable with treatment modifications and 
supportive therapies.  
A high incidence of liver-related TEAEs and liver-enzyme elevations [B: 114 subjects (46.0%) versus I: 
35  subjects  (13.9%)]  observed  for  bosutinib  in  the  first  line  population  of  study  3000-WW, 
transaminase elevations in the currently proposed target population derived from Study 200-WW were 
primarily  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  and  were  generally  managed  with  dose  interruptions  and  dose 
reductions. Dose adjustments recommendations in case of elevated liver transaminases are included in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Hepatic  toxicity  with  bosutinib  seemed  primarily  to  involve  isolated  transaminase  elevations,  which 
occurred most frequently within the first 6 months of treatment. The subjects remained asymptomatic 
despite  the  laboratory  abnormalities  and  the  majority  of  subjects  did  not  require  treatment 
discontinuation,  even  though  almost  30%  of  patients  in  bosutinib  arm  reported  hepatic-related  AEs 
that  led  to  treatment  interruption.  There  were  no  cases  of  permanent  hepatic  injury  and  no  liver-
related deaths in CML patients treated with bosutinib. 
However, it should be noted that t hepatic toxicity has only been evaluated beyond 12-24 months in a 
small population of about 250 patients in Study 3000-WW.In a terminated Phase 2 study 2207-W with 
bosutinib  in  metastatic  breast  cancer,  two  subjects  fulfilled  the  criteria  for  so  called  “Hy’s  law” 
indicating  intolerable  hepatotoxicity  for  a  drug.  Therefore,  the  potential  for  severe  drug-induced  liver 
injury  has to be considered with bosutinib exposure. Dose adjustments and warning on liver function 
abnormalities  are  included  in  the  SmPC.  In  addition,  as  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  had  an 
increased exposure as characterised in phase I study 3160A4-1111-EU and additionally a high rate of 
QTc-time prolongation related to drug exposure, a contraindication is included in the SmPC for patients 
with hepatic impairment.  
Phase I data suggests that renal impairment is not likely to have a significant impact on bosutinib’s PK. 
However, as subjects with Creatinine >1,5 ULN were excluded from the phase III studies confirmative 
information from these trials is absent. Therefore, the SmPC states that subjects with Creatinine > 1,5 
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 76/87 
 
 
 
ULN  were  excluded  from  clinical  studies  (see  sections  4.2  and  4.4).  A  study  in  patients  with  renal 
impairment is ongoing and results will be submitted as a post-authorisation measure.  
Two  cases  of  anaphylaxis  were  reported  across  the  bosutinib  clinical  development  program,  although 
none  were  reported  other  studies  including  in  Study  200-WW.    The  SmPC  therefore  includes  a 
contraindication in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
The  effects  of  concomitant  medication  for  the  management  of  bosutinib’s  adverse  event  profile 
requires further clarification. A clinical drug-drug interaction study on inhibition of P-gp is requested as 
a post-authorisation measure. Warnings with respect to interactions have been included in the SmPC, 
including with antiemetics, which are known to induce QTc prolongation. 
The  antiemetic  agent,  domperidone,  has  the  potential  to  increase  QT  interval  prolongation  and  to 
induce  “torsade  de  pointes”-  arrhythmias;  therefore,  co-administration  with  domperidone  should  be 
avoided. It should only be used, if other medicinal products are not efficacious. In these situations an 
individual benefit-risk assessment is mandatory and patients should be monitored for occurrence of QT 
prolongation (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Infection TEAEs and SAEs occurred more often in bosutinib subjects (40.7%) than in imatinib-treated 
subjects (31.1%). Whether this reflects a direct lymphocytotoxic effect of bosutinib, as postulated from 
animal model data, could not be further clarified by the data submitted. A warning that bosutinib may 
predispose to infections has been included in the product information. 
Bosutinib is a substrate of CYP3A and is susceptible to interaction with strong CYP3A inhibitors as well 
as  with  strong  CYP3A4  inducers.  Known  drug  interactions  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  product 
information.  
With  respect  to  concomitant  medication  it  seems  that  antidiarrhoeal  agents  were  frequently  needed. 
They had to be given for gastrointestinal toxicity in nearly every second subject with bosutinib at least 
for a short time. The SmPC includes recommendation for dose adjustments as well as a warning with 
respect  to  diarrhoea  and  vomiting.  A  post-hoc  analysis  of  diarrhoea  incidence  after  study  patients 
switch to the commercial formulation is planned as a post-authorisation measure. 
As  antidiarrhoeal  drugs  act  by  lowering  gastrointestinal  motility,  the  risk  of  higher  exposure  to 
bosutinib  was  assessed.  As  diarrhoea  is  dose-dependent,  such  an  effect  might  lead  to  a  paradoxical 
increase of diarrhoea events. A  warning has been included in the product information to address this 
issue (see SmPC section 4.4).  
The overall safety in the last-line indication was derived only from a small number of patients. 
However, based on additional analyses, no unexplained difference in safety profile became obvious 
during a comparison between the new target population and the total study populations of 200-WW or 
3000-WW. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The safety profile of bosutinib seems to be adequately characterised. Nevertheless the study to be 
conducted as a specific obligation in order to better characterise the efficacy in the last-line population 
will also provide further information on the safety of bosutinib.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Bosutinib  was  associated  with  pronounced  toxicities,  particularly  hepatotoxicity  and  gastrointestinal 
toxicity. However, the available safety data seems to indicate that bosutinib has a manageable safety 
profile in the subpopulation with an “unmet medical need”.  
The CHMP considered the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA : 
• 
To conduct a single-arm open-label, multi-centre efficacy and safety study of bosutinib in 
patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) 
previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom imatinib, 
nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. 
o  Submission of protocol: 30 May 2013 
o  Final clinical study report: 30 September 2018 
The benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of bosutinib outweighs the risk 
implicit in the fact that additional data are still required.

No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
•  Results for the carcinogenicity study have been submitted and do not indicate that further 
investigations are required. Carcinogenicity is no longer considered important missing 
information. The summary information on carcinogenicity provided in section 1.1.4 of the RMP 
should be updated to include information on the results of the study. 
•  Annex  3  of  the  RMP  should  be  amended  to  include  information  on  the  clinical  studies  as 
detailed above.  
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
The applicant requested to have a combined package leaflet for the 100 mg and 500 mg strengths. 
This was considered acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Bosutinib is a second generation TKI that binds the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl, which is characteristic for 
Ph+ CML, in an intermediate conformation thereby inhibiting Abl kinase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 
1 nM. In cell lines transfected with both wild type and imatinib-resistant mutant BCR-ABL it suppresses 
proliferation.  In  imatinib-sensitive  CML  cell  lines,  the  in-vitro  inhibitory  activity  of  bosutinib  is  up  to 
100-fold  that  of  imatinib,  with  IC50  values  ranging  from  1  to  20  nM.  In  imatinib-resistant  cell  lines 
(with  or  without  mutations)  bosutinib  inhibited  proliferation  up  to  114-fold  that  of  imatinib.  Bosutinib 
has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of various signalling proteins and downstream substrates of 
Bcr-Abl, most notably the transcription factor Stat5 and the docking protein CrkL.

Bosutinib could not be considered approvable for a 1st line indication in CML. as the pivotal Study 300-
WW failed to achieve the primary objective CCyR at 12 months and the updated analysis at 24 months 
showed that imatinib was actually numerically superior to bosutinib.  
According the relevant CHMP guideline-document a comparative study for bosutinib against the EU-
approved second line TKIs (dasatinib and nilotinib) is necessary for approval. However, such data was 
not available during the procedure and insofar, only a last line indication based on data in post-hoc 
defined subpopulation of patients with an “Unmet Medical Need” from study 200-WW could be further 
discussed for approval.  
Consequently, results of study 200-WW were considered as pivotal to support an indication of Bosulif 
in  a  last-line  CML  indication  “for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  phase (CP),  accelerated 
phase (AP),  and  blast  phase (BP)  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive (Ph+)  chronic  myelogenous 
leukaemia (CML) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) (TKIs) and for whom 
imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options”.  
The  pivotal  study  3160A4-200-WW  was  an  open-label,  uncontrolled  efficacy  and  safety  phase  I/II 
study of bosutinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukaemia. It was performed to explore 
whether  bosutinib  has  some  efficacy  in  second  and  third  line  CP-CML-patients  as  well  as  in  some  of 
those with more advanced CML stages (AP-CML and BP-CML).  Efficacy for the last-line indication was 
specifically investigated in a subpopulation of 52 patients, defined post hoc. 
In  this  study,  efficacy  was  seen  in  the  subpopulation  of  CP,  AP,  and  BP  CML  patients  who,  based  on 
clearly defined criteria, may not be candidates for treatment with at least 1 of the currently approved 
TKI  due  to  intolerance,  mutations,  or  comorbidities.  Although  these  subpopulations  were  small,  the 
efficacy  is  further  supported  by  the  results  seen  in  the  larger  reference  populations  within 
Study 200-WW. 
Of  the  52  patients  identified,  36  patients  were  in  the  CP  CML  subpopulation  (21  who  had  previously 
received  2  prior  TKIs  and  15  who  had  received  1  prior  TKI).  Of  the  21  CP  CML  patients  treated  with 
bosutinib  following  failure  of  imatinib  and  1  additional  second-generation  TKI  identified,  9  of  these 
patients  had  MCyR  or  better  including  2  patients  with  complete  molecular  response  (CMR),  1 patient 
with  major  molecular  response  (MMR),  4 patients  with  CCyR,  and  2 patients  with  partial  cytogenetic 
response (PCyR) and had a treatment duration exceeding 24 weeks. In addition, 7 other patients had a 
response  of  CHR  on  bosutinib  treatment.  Among  the  9 patients  with  a  response  of  MCyR  or  better, 
duration  of  MCyR  ranged  from  8 to  204 weeks  with  a  treatment  duration  ranging  from  35 to 
215+ weeks.  There  were  15  patients  who  received imatinib  and  no  other  second-generation  TKI  who 
met  these  criteria.  Of  these  15 patients  with  “unmet  medical  need”  who  had  received  prior  imatinib 
only,  9 patients  had  a  response  on  bosutinib  treatment  of  MCyR  or  better,  including  3  patients  with 
CMR,  1 patient  with  MMR,  4 patients  with  CCyR,  and  1 patients  with  PCyR  with  a  duration  of  MCyR 
ranging from 12 to 155 weeks and a treatment duration ranging from 24 to 197+ weeks. 
There  was  also  a  subpopulation  of  16  advanced  phase  patients  (5  AP  CML  and  11  BP  CML  patients) 
that  failed  treatment  with  either  imatinib  alone  or  imatinib  in  addition  to  one  or  both  second-
generation  TKIs  (dasatinib  and  nilotinib)  and  for  whom,  based  on  the  presence  of  co-morbidities,  a 
history of TKI intolerance, or a BCR-ABL resistance mutation, the remaining approved TKI(s) were not 
considered  appropriate  treatment  options.  Of  these,  4  of  the  5  AP  patients  had  notable  treatment 
duration  with  a  range  from  46  to  114  weeks  with  responses  including  CMR  (1  patient),  CCyR 
(2 patients)  and  major  haematologic  response  (MaHR)  (1  patient)  with  1  patient  still  on  treatment. 
Among  the  11 BP  CML  patients,  3 patients  remained  on  treatment  for  more  than  24  weeks  with 
notable  responses  (2  patients  with  a  CCyR  and  1 patient  with  a  MaHR)  and  a  treatment  duration 
ranging from 46 to 118 weeks with one patient still on treatment.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Although  the  second  generation  TKI  Bosutinib  is  clearly  efficacious  in  CML  patients,  efficacy  for  the 
currently  proposed  last-line  indication  is  only  shown  in  a  very  limited  population  selected 
retrospectively from an exploratory study. Thus, this efficacy needs to be confirmed prospectively in a 
larger population. The applicant has committed to perform an adequately designed study as a specific 
obligation  for  approval  in  order  to  generate  sufficient  data  on  efficacy  and  safety  in  the  last  line 
indication.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common TEAEs of bosutinib included gastrointestinal events, predominantly diarrhoea; 
myelosuppression, mainly thrombocytopenia; and transaminase elevations, particularly ALT. 
Hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal effects and cardiac arrhythmias were the most important toxicities 
associated with bosutinib.  
In the pivotal Study 200-WW, the safety profile of bosutinib seemed manageable and generally similar 
across all CML reference populations (CP, AP, and BP). But based on results from Study 3000-WW, it 
was concluded that toxicity in the first-line CP-CML patients was more pronounced than with imatinib. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity of Bosutinib is pronounced and diarrhoea was identified consistently as dose-
dependent and dose-limiting for bosutinib in all clinical studies.  
As with other TKI therapies for CML, myelosuppression events, including those of higher severity 
(Grade 3 or 4) were prevalent; however, they were also manageable with treatment modifications and 
supportive therapies.  
Hepatic toxicity with bosutinib seemed primarily to involve isolated transaminase elevations, which 
occurred most frequently within the first 6 months of treatment. The subjects remained asymptomatic 
despite the laboratory abnormalities and the majority of subjects did not require treatment 
discontinuation, even though almost 30% of patients in bosutinib arm reported hepatic-related AEs 
that led to treatment interruption. There were no cases of permanent hepatic injury and no liver-
related deaths in CML patients treated with bosutinib. However, Hy’s law cases associated with the use 
of bosutinib were documented. From the assessment of the AST/ALT/Bilirubin data provided in the 
response, it can be confirmed now that no further case fulfilling Hy’s law occurred in the CML 
population. 
Two  cases  of  anaphylaxis  were  reported  across  the  bosutinib  clinical  development  program,  although 
none  were  reported  in  other  studies  including  Study  200-WW.  The  SmPC  therefore  includes  a 
contraindication in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
Pharmacokinetic studies have shown 2-fold increases of bosutinib exposure and elimination half-life in 
patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  Additionally,  a  high  rate  of  QTc-time  prolongation  related  to  drug 
exposure. A contraindication is included in the SmPC for patients with hepatic impairment.  
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 83/87 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
All reported SAEs of increased AST/ALT in the bosutinib arm are reported as resolved; this might 
indicate that hepatotoxicity with adequate controls might be manageable. Consequently, 
recommendations for monitoring of liver function have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC as 
well as recommendations for dose interruptions and adjustements in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Diarrhoea events in the bosutinib arm were reported to be manageable; however, the overall impact of 
concomitant antidiarrhoeal medication on these events should be further described. A post-hoc 
analysis of diarrhoea incidence after study patients switch to the commercial formulation is planned as 
a post-authorisation measure.  
Diarrhoea and vomiting may lead to electrolyte disturbances (e.g. diarrhoea induced hypokalaemia and 
QTc prolongation); insufficient bioavailability (inadequate PK data on influence of diarrhoea); increase 
of bosutinib exposure secondary to antidiarrhoeal drugs, which may produce paradoxical worsening of 
the diarrhoea events in a vicious circle manner; more gastrointestinal infections. Diarrhoea and 
vomiting should be managed through dose adjustments and in accordance to the warnings in the 
SmPC (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 
A  proarrhythmic  potential  of  bosutinib  could  not  be  ruled  out  although  the  thorough  QT  study  was 
negative,  because  in  other  studies  clinically  relevant  QTc  prolongations  have  been  observed  and 
patients  with  cardiac  risk  factors  had  been  excluded  from  the  clinical  studies.  Consequently  bosutinib 
should  be  administered  with  caution  to  patients  who  have  a  history  of  or  predisposition  for  QTc 
prolongation and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is recommended (see section 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
The safety profile of bosutinib has been adequately characterised. Nevertheless the study to be 
conducted as a specific obligation in order to better characterise the efficacy in the last-line population 
will also provide further information on the safety of bosutinib. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
While available TKIs provide noteworthy clinical benefit, many patients ultimately develop intolerance 
or resistance to treatment, or experience disease transformation to advanced leukaemia. The presence 
of  resistance  mutations,  intolerance  to  specific  TKI  toxicities,  and  pre-existing  comorbidities  are  key 
considerations  for  selecting  one  TKI  over  another  for  a  specific  patient.  For  these  patients,  there  are 
currently  limited  or  no  treatment  options  and  bosutinib  may  offer  a  valuable  alternative  treatment 
option. The unique efficacy and safety profiles of currently available TKIs therefore drive the choice of 
initial and subsequent sequential treatments. A sizeable proportion of patients fail to achieve responses 
with  imatinib,  dasatinib  or  nilotinib.  Furthermore,  intolerance  due  to  intolerable  toxicity  with  the 
available TKIs is becoming a growing problem in the clinical management of CML patients. 
The available data from study 200-WW indicate that bosutinib is a possible treatment option for these 
patients  and  has  shown  that  CP  and  advanced  CML  patients,  who  are  resistant  and/or  intolerant  to 
imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, have a clinically relevant benefit from treatment with this drug.  
While bosutinib is associated with pronounced toxicity, particularly  hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal 
toxicity, its safety profile in the subpopulation with a high medical need and no other alternative at the 
time being was considered acceptable.  
Bosulif 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 84/87 
 
 
 
 
Benefit-risk balance 
In Study 200-WW bosutinib was associated with a clinically significant benefit in the subpopulations of 
CP,  AP,  and  BP  CML  patients,  who  were  previously  treated  with  one  or  more  TKIs  and  for  whom 
imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  were  not  considered  appropriate.  As  bosutinib  is  currently  the  only 
available TKI treatment option in this subpopulation, the toxicity profile is deemed acceptable. Thus, a 
positive benefit-risk balance in this subpopulation can be concluded.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Due  to  the  limited  evidence  currently  supporting  the  last-line  indication,  additional  comprehensive 
clinical  data  are  needed  from  a  clinical  interventional  study  of  bosutinib  in  patients  with  Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered 
appropriate treatment options.  
Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled primarily at large medical centres in Europe and the United 
States,  with  the  intent  to  enroll  up  to  75  patients  in  the  4th  or  later  line  setting.  Efficacy  endpoint 
assessment should be performed centralized and mutation analysis is expected. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  will  be  Major  Cytogenetic  Response  (MCyR)  rate  (chronic  phase)  and 
Confirmed  Overall  Haematological  Response  (OHR)  rate  (accelerated  and  blast  phase)  by  one  year. 
Efficacy  data  will  be  collected  at  regularly  scheduled  time-points  at  3,  6,  9  and  12  months  in  the 
different CML patient populations. 
It is expected that this study will further support the efficacy of bosutinib in the last-line treatment of 
adult  patients  with  chronic  phase  (CP),  accelerated  phase  (AP),  and  blast  phase  (BP)  Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered 
appropriate treatment options. 
The safety profile of bosutinib seems to be adequately characterised. Nevertheless the study to be 
conducted as a specific obligation will also provide further information on the safety of bosutinib. 
Such  a  study  is  considered  appropriate  to  allow  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  and  to  confirm 
the preliminary results observed in the target population as approved by CHMP. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Bosulif is not similar to Sprycel and Tasigna within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Bosulif in the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase (CP), 
accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous 
leukaemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom

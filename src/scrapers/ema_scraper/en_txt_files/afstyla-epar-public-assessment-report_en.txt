2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 9/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, 
non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. Rarely, 
life-threatening bleeding may also occur. Patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the 
extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient FVIII that is used to classify the disease severity (WFH, 
2012): 
• 
• 
• 
>1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
Afstyla is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The overall reported number of haemophilia A patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the World 
Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and 
identified 140,313 people with haemophilia A (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). There are currently 
approximately 30,000 patients in the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
10,000. 
Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family 
history and a carrier mother. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; their 
disease is presumably caused by new mutations. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, 
factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated 
factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot 
can be formed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Haemophilia A manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can lead to 
chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (Bolton-Maggs and Pasi, 2003). The majority of bleeding 
occurs internally into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. Serious 
bleeds also occur in muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and forearm, 
and in the mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. Less frequently, life 
threatening bleeds can occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the gastrointestinal system or 
enclosed areas like the intracranial or intracerebral spaces. The approximate frequencies of bleeds at the 
different sites are: 70 to 80% in joints (hemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in muscle, 5 to 10% in the central 
nervous system, and < 5% for bleeds at all other sites (Srivastava et al., 2013). 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 10/103 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of clotting 
factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of comprehensive 
haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home 
treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with 
haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
About the product 
Afstyla is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, lyophilized, white to slightly yellow 
powder or friable mass intended for intravenous administration provided in a single-use vial.  
It is a recombinant human protein that replaces the missing coagulation factor VIII needed for effective 
hemostasis. Afstyla is a single polypeptide chain with a truncated B-domain that allows for a covalent 
bond to link the factor VIII heavy and light chains. Afstyla has demonstrated a higher VWF affinity relative 
to full-length rFVIII. VWF stabilizes factor VIII and protects it from degradation. Activated Afstyla has an 
amino acid sequence identical to endogenous FVIIIa. 
Each single-use vial contains nominally 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU or 3000 IU 
(International Units) of rVIII-SingleChain for reconstitution with liquid diluent (Sterile Water for 
Injection), which is provided in glass vials (2.5 ml sWFI: 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU; 5.0 ml sWFI: 1500 IU, 
2000 IU, 2500 IU, 3000 IU). 
Type of application and aspects on development 
This application has been submitted as an Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC as a new active substance, 
lonoctocog alfa. Afstyla contains the rFVIII protein  
Afstyla is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. 
The posology for On Demand Treatment is proposed as follows: 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl.  
The required dose is determined using the following formula: Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x Desired 
factor VIII rise (IU/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dl). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following table can be 
used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

For long term prophylaxis, the recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 IU/kg of AFSTYLA administered 
2 to 3 times weekly. The regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.  
Previously untreated patients: 
The safety and efficacy of AFSTYLA in previously untreated patients have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Paediatric patients: 
The recommended starting regimen in children (0 to <12 years of age) is 30 to 50 IU per kg of AFSTYLA 
administered 2 to 3 times weekly. More frequent or higher doses may be required in children <12 years 
of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group. For adolescents of 12 years of age and above, 
the dose recommendations are the same as for adults. 
The development of Afstyla is in agreement with the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP); PIP 
P/0227/2015, it is noted that some measures were deferred. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Afstyla finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, lyophilized powder and solvent (water for injections 
(WFI)) for solution for i.v. administration supplied in single-use vials. Each single-use type I glass vial 
Assessment report

contains nominally 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 1500 IU,2000 IU, 2500 IU or 3000 IU (International Units) 
of recombinant, single chain coagulation factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain) for reconstitution with liquid 
diluent (Sterile Water for Injection), which is provided in type I glass vials (2.5 ml sWFI: 250 IU, 500 IU, 
1000 IU; 5.0 ml sWFI: 1500 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU, 3000 IU). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (AS) in Afstyla is “recombinant, single chain coagulation factor VIII”, which is 
expressed and secreted by CHO cells. 
The active substance is a single-chain recombinant Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain) construct where most 
of the B-domain and 4 amino acids of the adjacent acidic a3 domain were removed(amino acids 765 to 
1652 of full-length FVIII, including the furin-cleavage site). The newly formed linkage of the heavy and 
light chain of FVIII introduces a new N-glycosylation site. It has 1444 amino acids in a single chain 
glycopeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 170 kDa.  
After activation by thrombin and removal of the (residual) B- and a3-domain, the activated rFVIII (rFVIIIa) 
molecule formed has an amino acid sequence identical to FVIIIa formed from endogenous, full length, 
FVIII. 
The three dimensional structure of rVIII-SingleChain is stabilized by eight disulphide bridges. The 
presence of three “free thiols” has been confirmed. Regarding glycosylation, rVIII-SingleChain contains 
six N-glycosylation sites, but was found to have limited O-glycosylation. rVIII-SingleChain also exhibits 
nearly complete sulphation of its tyrosine residues. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the active substance consists of an upstream cell culture process and a 
downstream purification process. The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail in line 
with ICH Q11. For all sites involved in manufacture and testing of rFVIII-SingleChain bulk drug 
intermediate (BDI) and active substance compliance to cGMP has been confirmed by respective 
certificates issued by EU Competent Authorities.  
The active substance manufacturing process consists of 12 steps, including cell culture, column 
chromatography purification and concentration unit operations. Additionally there are 3 validated virus 
removal steps two of which are dedicated.  
The first steps cover the WCB vial thaw, cell expansion and bioreactor cultivation. Obtained harvests are 
concentrated and stored. The hold time of the harvest bags has been adequately justified. Two 
chromatography steps for primary capture, concentration and buffer exchange, and a solvent/detergent 
(S/D) virus inactivation step are performed to obtain the BDI.  
The downstream purification process consists of 3 chromatography steps for further purification and a 
virus nanofiltration step.  
The upstream part of the manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. It can be 
concluded that the rFVIII-SingleChain is produced in a state-of-the-art, well-controlled and efficient cell 
culture process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 13/103 
 
 
 
 
 
The downstream purification process follows a common purification strategy, consisting of 
chromatography and filtration steps and two virus-removal steps. Full-scale validation studies on the 
re-use and regeneration of chromatography columns have been provided.  
Control of Materials 
In line with ICH Q5B, the source and history of the CHO cell line into which the rFVIII gene transcript was 
cloned and the characteristics of the mammalian expression vector have been described. The parental cell 
line is commonly used for the expression of foreign proteins. The rationale for particular characteristics of 
the rFVIII construct has been described: a stable and efficiently expressed construct was selected by 
analysing structure-function relationships of various constructs. Most suitable characteristics were a 
B-domain-deleted construct with reduced proteolytic degradation, intact thrombin cleavage sites and 
linker sequence for full activation and coagulation activity, good Von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding, and 
low immunogenic risk of the linker region. The rationale for the introduction of an additional 
N-glycosylation site in the linker region in order to reduce the antigenicity risk has been provided. 
The CHO host cell line used to create the rVIII-SingleChain cell substrate was confirmed to be free from 
contamination by viruses, bacteria (including mycoplasma) and fungi (moulds and yeasts). Cell bank 
characterisation test reports have been provided and the integrity of the final expression vectors was 
verified.  
In line with ICH Q5A (R1) “Quality of Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology 
Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin” and Q5D the comparability of the MCB, the 
WCB and the post production cell bank (PPCB) with respect to identity, the absence of adventitious agents 
and the genetic stability has been demonstrated. 
A two-tiered cell banking system has been established using a MCB and a WCB. The WCB was found to be 
free of adventitious agents, genetically stable, and comparable to the underlying MCB.  
The genetic stability and productivity beyond the in vitro cell age has been demonstrated on an 
end-of-production (EoP) cell bank and a post-production cell bank (PPCB).  
Most raw materials used in the manufacture of BDI and of active substance are of Ph. Eur. quality. For 
non-compendial raw materials satisfactory specifications have been presented. Beside the host cell line of 
hamster origin no other raw material of human or animal origin is used in the purification and formulation 
processes of rFVIII-SingleChain. 
All chromatography steps are performed in the absence of any human-or animal-derived raw material and 
each chromatography resin in use is dedicated to rFVIII-SingleChain. All materials used in the 
manufacture of filters are either animal free or in compliance with Note for Guidance on minimising the 
risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal 
products (EMA/410/01, current version). 
Control of Critical Steps and Intermediates 
The rVIII-SingleChain active substance process control strategy was developed using a systematic, 
scientific, and risk-based approach. The control strategy was developed to appropriately control sources 
of process variability such that the desired process performance and product quality (i.e., Critical Quality 
Attributes (CQA)) are consistently achieved. This included process parameters classification and process 
parameter risk assessment. Respective risk assessment reports have been provided. In their process 
control strategy (PCS) “critical steps” have been defined as those that contain critical process parameters 
(CPP), in-process controls (IPC) and /or in-process acceptance criteria (IPAC). CPP, IPC and IPAC have 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 14/103 
 
 
 
 
 
been defined in accordance with ICH Q8(R2) and ICH Q6B. The limits/acceptance criteria are based on 
statistical analysis of historical data, process characterisation and process capability.  
The monitoring parameters, the test methods and their acceptance criteria appear suitable to control the 
BDI.  
Process validation  
The process performance qualification was designed to verify the process control strategy by 
demonstrating that the process, when operated within the defined ranges, produces rVIII-SingleChain AS 
that consistently meets all in-process controls, in process acceptance criteria, sampling/testing 
requirements, and release specifications. 
Process validation master plans (PVMPs) have been prepared which adopted very similar process 
validation methodology and included implementation of the lifecycle approach to process validation. The 
master plans describe the activities that are included in each stage of the rVIII-SingleChain AS process 
validation program including Stage 1 (Process Design), Stage 2 (Process Qualification) and Stage 3 
(Continued Process Verification). The process validation uses small scale and full scale studies and follows 
current FDA and EMA guidance on process validation.  
The outcomes of the validation studies demonstrate that the manufacturing process operates at all steps 
consistently within the proposed acceptance ranges and provides product that meets pre-set acceptance 
criteria.  
In ancillary validation studies the mixing steps, intermediate hold times, chromatography resin and 
membrane life times, as well as material shipment have been successfully validated. It has been 
sufficiently demonstrated that the small scale experiments on the chromatography steps are 
representative for the commercial scale process, including sanitization procedures. 
Manufacturing Process Development 
Two manufacturing scales can be distinguished: material from pilot scale cell culture was used for 
preclinical and early clinical studies, commercial scale bioreactor material for later stage clinical 
development. Comparability of the material from the different development stages (plot and commercial 
scale) has been demonstrated. No significant differences have been observed in the cell culture process 
performance. Comparison of in-process quality attributes during the downstream purification process at 
pilot and commercial scale indicated that despite some differences at individual steps the results are 
comparable.  
Characterisation 
A detailed characterisation of rFVIII-SingleChain has been presented determining primary, secondary and 
higher order structures, and studying functional properties in comparison to commercial rFVIII and 
plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII). The expected amino acid sequence of the fusion construct has been fully 
confirmed. 
From functional characterizations it is apparent that rFVIII-SingleChain has a much lower FVIII activity in 
the OS clotting assay compared to the chromogenic substrate assay. The ratio OS/ChS assay activity is 
~0.5 and substantially lower than in other rFVIII products or in pd FVIII. The differences in FVIII activity 
between rFVIII-SingleChain and competitor rFVIII products is more pronounced when using the OS 
assay, compared to the ChS assay.  
A respective statement is included in the SmPC pointing out that the chromogenic substrate assay should 
be used during clinical monitoring, if available. If the OS assay is used, the results are approximately 45 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 15/103 
 
 
 
 
 
% lower than the ChS results. It is indicated in the SmPC that results from OS and ChS assay can be 
aligned by multiplying the OS results by the factor 2. For practical reasons in daily clinical use, the 
Applicant decided to round the initially suggested factor 1.8 to 2, and amended the SmPC accordingly.  
The levels of product-related impurities present in commercial scale AS batches were monitored by 
several methods that are part of the AS testing and by additional tests for a limited number of batches. In 
general, a very low impurity level was observed. The formation of product related impurities is 
convincingly controlled. 
Process related impurities have been investigated in detail using state-of-the-art methodology. Major and 
minor process-related impurities have been identified and characterised by sensitive analytical methods. 
It is demonstrated that the manufacturing process effectively and consistently reduces impurities, and 
that rVIII-SingleChain AS contains only low level of process-related impurities which seem to be of no risk 
for the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 
Specification 
The control of the active substance is performed in line with ICH Q6B. An adequate set of active substance 
release specification (Table 1) has been established to cover structural and functional characteristics, 
critical impurities and the safety of rFVIII-SingleChain. The specifications have been established based on 
statistical evaluation of historical batch analysis data from AS batches of pilot and commercial scale. 
Moreover, process and assay capability as well as patient safety and clinical experience were taken into 
consideration when establishing release specifications. Batch analysis data from pilot and commercial 
scales AS batches indicate that the AS release specification is consistently met.  
Considerable variation in FVIII one stage assay results is seen in active substance batches. This has been 
adequately discussed from a quality and safety point of view. 
For all analytical test procedures descriptions have been provided. The methods have been validated in 
line with ICH Q1(R2).  
Reference Standards 
For the FVIII potency an adequate characterisation of the working standard has been performed. A list of 
acceptance criteria for current and future reference materials has been specified in case a replacement of 
material is needed. The formulation (dilution) and the storage conditions of the reference standard have 
been described, including the container closure system. A re-test period has been specified for the 
potency standard or any other standard, including acceptance criteria for the declared potency value. The 
reference standard has been calibrated against the WHO International Standard (IS).   
The initial potency assignment for new reference standards in relation to the current IS or a new IS and 
the acceptance criteria for the establishment of new reference standards have been described in sufficient 
detail. The strategy for replacement of the working standard and the proposed stability monitoring 
program can be accepted. Regarding the establishment of a new WRS or a new IS, the proposed strategy 
ensures that the consistency in the labelling of the clinical batches and the commercial batches during the 
product life cycle is guaranteed.  
Stability 
The stability of the active substance under long-term has been investigated in line with ICH Q5C “Stability 
testing of Biotechnological/Biological products”. Real time/real temperature data are presented for 
commercial scale AS batches. Stability data provided no evidence that quality parameters show a 
negative trending and the proposed shelf life can be accepted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 16/103 
 
 
 
 
 
The active substance is either processed immediately after the virus filtration step or is stored for the 
claimed shelf life at the proposed storage conditions. The storage containers for the bulk active substance 
are in compliance with compendial requirements (Ph. Eur. and USP). 
Adequate details on the storage containers used for the hold time stability studies of the bioreactor 
harvests and chromatography eluates have been provided including data that demonstrate an acceptable 
extractable and leachable level. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as a single-use type I glass vials of 6 mL (250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU of 
lonoctocog alfa per vial) and 10 mL (1500 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU, 3000 IU of lonoctocog alfa per vial) 
intended for intravenous (i.v.) injection. The vials are closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed 
with an aluminum overseal closure using different colors for the various strengths.  
The active substance rVIII-SingleChain is formulated in a histidine buffer containing stabilizers and a 
bulking agent. The formulation contains the excipients L-histidine, polysorbate 80, calcium chloride 
dihydrate, sodium chloride and sucrose. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. 
The lyophilized finished product is reconstituted with sterile water for injections. For the 250 IU, 500 IU 
and 1000 IU strengths 2.5 ml of sWFI and for the 1500 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU and 3000 IU strengths 5.0 
ml of sWFI are used.  
The development of the finished product manufacturing process occurred in two key stages. The pilot 
scale process supplied finished product for preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies as well as 
early clinical studies and stability studies (clinical study CSL627_1001). The commercial scale process 
(250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU) supplied finished product for further clinical studies 
(CSL627_1001, CSL627_3001, CSL627_3002), stability studies and PPQ studies. 
The first stage of the finished product development at the pilot scale comprised the development of the 
1000 IU strength. Later on during scale-up to the commercial scale production process, the additional 
strengths including 250 IU, 500 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU were implemented. 
The 1500 IU and 2500 IU strengths were introduced following completion of the development program for 
the initial five strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU). The formulation development 
studies resulted in a formulation procedure allowing all strengths to be formulated using the same 
formulation buffer. The different strengths are formulated by addition of varying amounts of the 
formulation buffer to obtain the desired strength. The formulation buffer developed is free of 
animal-derived materials.  
The unit operations were consistent throughout development. Process changes included mostly scale-up 
changes and also process optimizations were performed. The product fill volumes (2.5 ml: 250 IU, 500 IU, 
1000 IU; 5,0 ml: 1500 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU, 3000 IU) as well as the respective lyophilisation cycles were 
adapted depending on the strength. 
Two fill volume-specific lyophilitzation cycles were developed for the 250 IU, 500 IU and 1000 IU 
strengths as well as for the 1500 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU and 3000 IU strengths (5,0 ml). The development 
studies of the lyophilisation process lead to a robust commercial freeze-drying process which yields a 
product with consistent quality attributes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 17/103 
 
 
 
 
 
The finished product formulation was shown to be stable and no overages are applied during manufacture 
of the finished product. The stability data support compatibility of the active substance with the finished 
product excipients. The lyophilized finished product is a white whole to slightly yellow powder.  
No major process changes regarding the finished product manufacturing process occurred during the life 
cycle from development to commercial scale manufacturing, indicating that the Phase I, Phase I/II and 
Phase III clinical trial material as well as the commercial product are manufactured by almost the same 
process and are of comparable quality. No formulation changes were performed. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing of the finished product consists of formulation and sterile filtration, filling, 
lyophilization, capping and crimping, labelling and packaging. A detailed process flow diagram including a 
summary of the in-process controls (IPC) and in-process acceptance criteria (IPAC) tests conducted at 
each stage of the manufacturing process and interim storage conditions has been provided.  
The active substance from Step 12 is the starting material for the finished product manufacturing process. 
The active substance can be stored frozen at ≤-65 °C or used immediately.  
Reprocessing 
The validation reports supporting reprocessing for one step have been provided. 
In addition, the process control strategy as well the controlled parameters (input and output parameters) 
for the different operation units were described in detail. The Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each input 
parameter was calculated. These scores were used to identify potential high risk parameters that needed 
specific focus in validation studies. The process is considered appropriately controlled. 
Control of Critical Steps and Process Control Strategy 
During process development, a risk-based and science-based approach was used to reveal the 
relationship between manufacturing process variables and product quality attributes. 
The Process Control Strategy ensures consistent manufacture of finished product that meets its defined 
critical quality attributes (CQAs). In developing this strategy, all process parameters were evaluated with 
regard to risk of failure, taking into account scientific rationale, data from process characterization studies 
and historical manufacturing data. The suitability of the control strategy was confirmed during PPQ.  
A Process Validation Master Plan was developed which defines the strategy to ensure a reliable and 
consistent manufacturing process capable of delivering product of appropriate quality. 
The finished product manufacturing process was qualified according to a prospective PPQ protocol which 
defined the sampling, analytical testing and acceptance criteria for each process step. The PPQ results 
have been presented. Taken together, all study objectives of the PPQ were met and the defined PCS was 
successfully validated for the manufacture of finished product. 
Validation data were presented covering the finished product manufacturing steps including formulation, 
sterile filtration, filling and lyophilization. In addition, information on the hold times as well the 
reprocessing at the sterile filtration step has been provided. 
In general, the process validation strategy provided is acceptable and follows a Continuous Process 
Verification approach as described in the relevant guidelines on process validation for finished products 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1 – Process Validation; ICH Q8 (R2 – Pharmaceutical 
Development)). 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 18/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, a Continued Process Verification (CPV) plan is in place to ensure the validated state of the 
finished product manufacturing process throughout the commercial life cycle.  
Product specification 
The finished product specification used for release/shelf life testing is considered appropriate including 
adequate tests for integrity, potency, purity and quality. The acceptance criteria for the control 
parameters are based on historical batch data (pilot scale and/or commercial scale). The specification 
parameters and their acceptance criteria are adequate and meet the requirements of guideline ICH Q6B.  
Analytical methods 
Adequate detail on the analytical procedures and their validation has been provided. Batch analysis  
Based on the batch analysis data presented for the commercial batches (validated process), acceptance 
criteria for the parameter protein concentration were introduced. In addition, the limits (release and shelf 
life) for the parameter HMWC were revised.  
The information provided on the batch analysis data as well as on the characterization of the process- and 
product-related impurities is considered appropriate. Product-derived impurities, e.g. aggregates and 
degradation products are controlled in both the active substance and the finished product manufacturing 
process. Specifications regarding product-related impurities were established. No new process-related 
impurities were identified in the finished product when compared to the active substance. 
Potency Reference Standard 
The 8th International Standard for FVIII concentrate (NIBSC 07/350) is used as Primary Reference 
Standard. A product-specific Working Reference Standard was established which was calibrated against 
the 8th International Standard for FVIII concentrate (NIBSC 07/350). 
A consistent potency declaration from early clinical trials throughout the commercial life cycle is in place.  
The general strategy for the establishment, the calibration and the stability monitoring of the Reference 
Standards (PRS and WRS) is discussed in more detail in the active substance section. 
Stability of the product 
The stability of the finished product was investigated for all strengths. Long-term stability studies for 
commercial scale batches at +5°C, +25°C, 30°C and +40°C (stress condition) were performed in order to 
monitor the physical, chemical and biological integrity of the finished product over time. Temperature 
shift studies were also included. 
The batches included into the stability studies used the final container closure system. The container 
closure system consists of 6 ml and 10 ml type I glass vials and a bromobutyl rubber stopper. The 
stoppers are secured by combination caps consisting of an aluminum crimp cap with a concentric hole and 
an integrated polypropylene plastic disc. The packaging materials for storage of the finished product are 
in compliance with Ph. Eur. and USP requirements and are suitable for the intended use. The silicone oil 
compatibility of closures with the product has been discussed. 
Studies regarding leachables and extractables were presented. The evaluations assessed non-volatile 
(LC-MS) and semi-volatile substances (GC-MS) as well as inorganic elements (ICP-MS). In addition, the 
issue of possible leachables and extractables derived from the bromobutyl rubber stopper was addressed, 
and the risk assessment was provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 19/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the currently available stability data presented the finished product was shown to be stable at 
the various storage conditions. In addition, the available stability data for the reconstituted product show 
physicochemical stability for up to 48 hours at maximum +25 °C. From a microbiological point of view the 
reconstituted product should be used immediately after reconstitution.  
A photostability study was performed according to ICH 1B. The data presented indicate that the finished 
product must be stored protected from light.  Accelerated stability studies at +40 °C and forced 
degradation studies showed changes in finished product as expected and confirmed that the assays used 
in the stability program are stability indicating. 
The stability studies provided are in general acceptable. The proposed shelf life claim is supported by 
suitable stability data for the 250 IU, 500 IU and 1000 IU strengths.  
The currently available real time/real temperature data for commercial scale batches support the 
proposed shelf life of 3 years for all dosage strengths at 2 °C to 8 °C including a single period of up to 3 
months storage at +25 °C as well as the reconstitution stability as claimed in the SmPC. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal product 
The comparability of finished product manufactured using the pilot or commercial scale process was 
evaluated. Analytical comparability studies were performed in order to show that the early non-clinical 
and clinical data generated using material from the pilot scale process was supportive of the commercial 
scale process material which was used for further clinical studies. 
The comparability of the performance of the manufacturing processes of the finished product at the pilot 
scale and the commercial scale was assessed by comparing product quality attributes and process 
performance attributes throughout the manufacturing process. Comparability was also assessed by 
comparison of the analytical specification and characterization results obtained for the Bulk Drug 
Intermediate (BDI), the active substance and the finished product. 
Finished product comparability was assessed by product safety attributes, filling and lyophilization 
performance attributes and product quality attributes. 
The comparison demonstrated that material manufactured using the pilot scale process was comparable 
to material manufactured using the commercial scale process.  
No major process changes regarding the finished product manufacturing process occurred during the life 
cycle from development to commercial manufacturing, indicating that the Phase I, Phase I/II and the 
Phase III clinical trial material of the commercial scale process as well as the commercial product are 
manufactured by the same process and are of comparable quality. 
In conclusion, the comparability studies are in compliance with the guideline ICH Q5E.  
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was only used before generation MCB. Compliance with the TSE Guideline 
(EMEA/410/01, current version) has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
Virus safety 
The recombinant therapeutic protein is produced in a cell culture medium free of animal or 
human-derived components. MCB and WCB and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age have been sufficiently 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 20/103 
 
 
 
 
 
screened for adventitious and endogenous viruses. The tests failed to demonstrate the presence of viral 
contaminants.  
Only A-type retrovirus like particles have been identified. CHO cells are well known to produce 
endogenous retrovirus-like particles. The presence of retroviral particles in CHO-cells is not of concern 
since there is excess reduction capacity for retroviral particles within the manufacturing process. 
The purification process includes three steps (chromatography, S/D treatment, and serial nanofiltration) 
which have been validated for their virus removal capacity of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. 
Sufficient overall virus safety has been demonstrated.  
Finished product - Solvent WfI in a vial 
The information provided for the solvent shows that the sWFI is manufactured under GMP compliant 
conditions using a validated process.  
sWFI is provided as 2.5 ml and 5.0 fill sizes in 6 ml type I glass vials which are closed with a chlorobutyl 
stopper. sWFI produced by CSL Behring in Marburg, Germany meets Ph. Eur. requirements for sterile WFI 
and has a shelf life of 60 month when stored at +25 (± 2)°C / 60 (± 5) % RH. The proposed shelf life is 
supported by real time stability data. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory way. The results of tests carried out indicate that the active substance is manufactured in a 
validated and well-controlled process, including two virus-reduction steps, yielding an active substance of 
consistent quality and safety. No material of animal or human origin is used in the purification and 
formulation of the active substance, except the CHO cell line. A relatively high discrepancy is seen 
between results generated with the OS clotting assay and the chromogenic substrate assay (ChS/OS ratio 
~1.8), indicating that the compendial ChS assay should be used for monitoring rFVIII-SingleChain. The 
use of a correction factor of 2 when using a one stage clotting assay during clinical monitoring in order to 
align results with chromogenic assay results appears justified from a quality point of view. No influence of 
vWF on the outcome of FVIII potency of rFVIII-SingleChain was found, except at very low vWF level.  
Sufficient details on the different reference materials used in the release testing of active substance and 
finished product have been presented. The strategy to use the WHO IS as PRS and not to implement a 
product-specific PRS, calibrated against the WHO IS, can be accepted. In addition, adequate details have 
been presented: on the initial calibration of the WRS against the WHO IS; on the strategy for 
re-calibration of a WRS once a new WHO IS becomes available or when replacing a WRS and on the WRS 
stability monitoring program. It has been also adequately discussed how the consistency in the labelling 
of the clinical batches and the commercial batches during the product life cycle is guaranteed. 
Finished product 
The finished product is manufactured by a process that operates reproducibly within established 
parameters leading to a product that meets its pre-determined quality attributes. The process was 
validated in a continuous process verification approach and the respective Master Validation Plan was 
provided. 
An adequate set of control parameters, IPCs, and IPACs including the limits and acceptance criteria was 
established based on a risk analysis to control the quality of the finished product. The chosen control 
strategy is considered appropriate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 21/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Several specification parameters including the total protein amount and the HMWC (SE-HPLC) were 
revised based on the batch analysis data available for the commercial and validated process. 
The currently available real time/real temperature data is acceptable in order to support the claimed shelf 
life and storage temperature as well as the reconstitution stability as claimed in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
The information on the development, manufacture, process validation and control of the active substance 
has been described in sufficient detail. It can be concluded that the active substance manufacturing 
process operates under well-controlled conditions leading to an active substance of consistent quality and 
safety. The active substance has been intensively characterized, both on pilot and commercial scale 
batches. Efficient removal of product-and process-related impurities is demonstrated. The active 
substance release specifications are adequately set; a release specification for individual N-glycans 
(neutral, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasialylated glycans) will be established post-approval, once sufficient 
data are available. As well the active specification for monomer peak in RP-HPLC of ≥75% will be 
re-evaluated and adjusted, if needed (Recommendations). 
Finished product 
Overall, the data presented indicate that the finished product is manufactured by a validated, controlled 
process taking into consideration relevant guidance documents. Batch release data confirm a product of 
consistent quality. The finished product manufacturing process operates under validated conditions to 
yield a finished product of consistent quality.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application 
for Afstyla is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended some points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic studies were performed in vitro and in vivo. While the in vitro studies were 
performed in the species used for toxicology studies, i.e. rat and monkey, with the aim to show 
pharmacodynamic efficacy in these species, the in vivo studies were performed in FVIII deficient mice 
(FVIII knock-out [ko] mice, haemophilia A mice), which have demonstrated similar deficiencies in their 
coagulation system compared to human patients and show an increased bleeding risk which is also seen 
in haemophilia A patients. 
The safety pharmacology investigations were included in the toxicology studies as appropriate, and 
complemented by specific studies as necessary.

Table 1: Overview of pharmacological studies 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Study: Pharmacodynamic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in preclinical tox species using 
thrombin generation. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in plasma of CD 
rats. The thrombin generation assay was selected as read-out for haemostatic efficacy, since it was 
shown to be a sensitive model discriminating pharmacological activity of FVIII products in a range of FVIII 
concentrations of 10-320 % of the norm. 
rVIII-SingleChain was spiked at concentrations of 1 to 30 IU/mL based on chromogenic FVIII activity to 
plasma derived from female CD rats. Pharmacodynamic activity was determined based on a thrombin 
generation assay using a calibrated automated thrombogram. Coagulation was triggered using the 
PPP-Reagent. The TGA variables peak height, time to peak, lagtime, and endogenous thrombin potential 
were subjected to statistical analysis. 
rVIII-SingleChain showed a concentration-dependent pharmacodynamics effect on thrombin generation 
compared to the negative control. Peak height increased and time to peak shortened 
concentration-dependently and statistically significantly with increasing concentrations of 
rVIII-SingleChain up to 10 IU/mL. There was no concentration-dependent effect of rVIII-SingleChain on 
lagtime, and no effect of rVIII-SingleChain on ETP. 
rVIII-SingleChain showed a concentration-dependent pharmacodynamics effect on thrombin generation 
in plasma of CD rats, measured as an increase of thrombin peak and a reduction of time to peak,

supporting the rat as a pharmacological relevant animal model for non-clinical rVIII-SingleChain 
investigations. 
Study: Pharmacodynamic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in monkey plasma using thrombin 
generation. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamics efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in plasma 
derived from cynomolgus monkeys. 
The results demonstrated that rVIII-SingleChain showed a concentration-dependent pharmacodynamic 
effect in plasma derived from cynomolgus monkeys based on thrombin generation as characterized by an 
increase in thrombin peak and ETP and a reduction in time to peak supporting the cynomolgus monkey as 
pharmacological relevant animal model for non-clinical rVIII-SingleChain investigations. 
In vivo studies 
Study: Pharmacodynamic comparison of rVIII-SingleChain  and Advate regarding 
thromboelastography and thrombin generation parameters following a single intravenous 
injection to Haemophilia A mice. 
The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effect of rVIII-SingleChain and the marketed 
full length rFVIII product Advate on thromboelastography and thrombin generation parameters ex vivo in 
FVIII deficient whole blood (TEG/TEM) or plasma (TGA) using FVIII ko mice. 
Both rFVIII products, rVIII-SingleChain and Advate, were administered intravenously at dose levels of 20 
IU/kg according to chromogenic FVIII activity (in house measurements for rVIII-SingleChain, nominal 
activity for Advate) 15 min prior to blood sampling. Pharmacodynamic activity of the test substances was 
tested using thromboelastography/thromboelastometry to assess the viscoelasticity of whole blood and 
to monitor bleeding management in relation to blood clotting quality and thrombin generation in presence 
of Pathromtin SL and phospholipids (0.5 mM Phospholipid-TGT). 
The pharmacodynamic activity of rVIII-SingleChain did not differ significantly from the marketed 
recombinant full-length FVIII product Advate and the overall hemodynamic capacity of rVIII-SingleChain 
appears to be comparable to Advate when dosed according to chromogenic FVIII activity. 
Study: Pharmacodynamic comparison of rVIII-SingleChain and Advate regarding aPTT 
following a single intravenous injection to Haemophilia A mice. 
The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effect of rVIII-SingleChain and the marketed 
full length rFVIII product Advate in an aPTT ex vivo test using FVIII deficient plasma from FVIII ko mice. 
Additionally, FVIII activity was determined in the plasma samples using the chromogenic and the 
one-stage clotting FVIII assay to confirm exposure. 
Both products were administered intravenously at a dose level of 20 IU/kg to FVIII ko mice 15 min prior 
to blood sampling. They were administered for the rVIII-SingleChain group according to chromogenic 
FVIII activity and for the Advate group according to nominal activity. FVIII activity (clotting and 
chromogen) was determined to confirm exposure, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 
analysed as a measure for pharmacodynamic activity (correction of hemostasis). 
The results obtained for both rFVIII products for the activated partial thromboplastin time, the clotting 
FVIII activity, and the chromogenic FVIII activity compared to the control group demonstrated a clear 
effect on the endpoints measured. Both test items could restore the FVIII coagulation parameter aPTT to 
a comparable degree. At the same time, FVIII activity increased significantly in plasma, thereby 
confirming exposure. The increase in FVIII activity was slightly larger for rVIII-SingleChain as compared

to Advate in the chromogenic FVIII assay and smaller in the clotting FVIII assay indicating that changes 
in aPTT are in line with chromogenic FVIII activity, but correlate less stringent with clotting FVIII activity. 
Studies: (A) Correction of hemostasis in FVIII ko mice following treatment with 
rVIII-SingleChain, Helixate, ReFacto AF and Humate P and (B): Correction of hemostasis in 
FVIII ko mice following treatment with rVIII-SingleChain, Helixate, ReFacto AF, Advate and 
Humate P. 
The primary aim of these studies was to establish a dose-response relationship regarding the haemostatic 
efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in haemophilia A mice (FVIII ko mice). In addition, effects of 
rVIII-SingleChain were compared with marketed, clinically relevant, rFVIII products, i.e. the full-length 
proteins Helixate and Advate, the B-domain-deleted protein ReFacto AF, and the plasma-derived human 
coagulation FVIII/von Willebrand Factor complex concentrate Humate P at dose levels between 1 IU/kg 
and 150 IU/kg FVIII activity, except for Humate P (41 IU/kg). As a secondary aim, aPTT was determined 
in all test groups at the end of the observation period. 
The FVIII dose was determined by a chromogenic assay. It is noteworthy, that according to a one-stage 
clotting assay, the dose of rVIII-SingleChain was about 2.8 fold lower than that of Helixate, about 1.6 fold 
lower than that of ReFacto AF and about 2.3 fold lower than that of Advate.  
The rFVIII concentrate rVIII-SingleChain demonstrated its haemostatic efficacy in haemophilia A mice. 
Thereby, the results obtained for the haemostatic efficacy differ slightly depending on the assay system 
used for dose adjustment chromogenic FVIII assay system vs. one-stage-clotting FVIII assay system).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In accordance with the ICH guideline S6, the safety pharmacology investigation concerning 
measurements of cardiovascular variables was included in the 28 day repeat-dose toxicity study in 
monkeys. In addition, the assessment of potential neurobehavioral effects of rVIII-SingleChain was 
integrated in the subchronic repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. A further in depth investigation of potential 
effects of rVIII-SingleChain on hemodynamic and electrophysiological parameters was conducted in dogs 
and monkeys , whereas the impact on respiratory variables was assessed in dogs only. During these 
studies, rVIII-SingleChain was administered i.v. at a cumulative dose of up to 1550 IU/kg either under 
anaesthetized conditions or in conscious telemetered animals. 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to CD rats for 4 
weeks followed by a 14 day recovery period.  
Potential effects of rVIII-SingleChain on the central nervous system were assessed as part of a repeat 
toxicity study in CD rats following intravenous (bolus) administration over a period of up to 4 weeks.  
Overall, there were no treatment related changes to the clinical signs observed during the Irwin 
assessment. Furthermore, there were no macroscopic or histopathological changes observed which were 
considered to be indicative of an effect on the central nervous system.

Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to cynomolgus 
monkeys for 4 weeks.  
The potential effects of rVIII-SingleChain on electrophysiological parameters and blood pressure were 
assessed as part of a repeat toxicity study performed in cynomolgus monkeys following daily intravenous 
(bolus) administration of rVIII-SingleChain over a period of 4 weeks, with a day 6 interim period.  
Overall, the electrophysiology of the heart was considered unaffected by rVIII-SingleChain treatment. 
There were no obvious dose-related effects seen from the observations or the numerical data derived 
from the electrocardiograms recorded during the course of the study. Blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements were considered to be unaffected by rVIII-SingleChain treatment.  
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Effects on general haemodynamics and respiratory variables in 
anaesthetized beagle dogs (intravenous infusion administration). 
The potential effects of rVIII-SingleChain on electrophysiological and hemodynamic endpoints as well as 
respiratory parameters were assessed in anaesthetised dogs following a cumulative administration of 
increasing doses of rVIII-SingleChain. Two groups of dogs, each comprising 2 females and 2 males, 
received dose volumes of vehicle (0.9% w/v saline) equivalent to the volumes required to administer 
rVIII-SingleChain at dose levels of 50, 250 and 1250 IU/kg resulting in a cumulative dose of 1550 IU/kg 
rVIII-SingleChain. The test substances were administered at three consecutive intervals of 45 min 
duration comprising 30 min of test item administration followed by a period of 15 min between the end of 
one infusion to the start of the next infusion. 
Overall, the pharmacologically relevant falls in cardiovascular parameters after treatment with 
rVIII-SingleChain (1250 IU/kg) were considered unlikely to be directly attributable to the active 
ingredient of rVIII-SingleChain. To confirm this hypothesis, follow-up studies were conducted in a 
conscious dog and monkeys under telemetric conditions  
Study: Telemetric evaluation of cardiovascular effects in the conscious beagle dog 
(intravenous infusion administration).  
The potential effects of rVIII-SingleChain on electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were 
assessed in a telemetered dog following a cumulative administration of increasing doses of  
rVIII-SingleChain. One telemetered, male dog received increasing dose volumes vehicle (dilution buffer 
for rVIII-SingleChain) equivalent to the volumes required to administer rVIII-SingleChain or doses of 50, 
250 and 1250 IU/kg resulting in a cumulative dose of 1550 IU/kg rVIII-SingleChain. rVIII-SingleChain 
and the vehicle, dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain, were administered on separate days using the same 
dosing regimen as in the study performed in anaesthetized beagle dogs, thus test substances were 
administered at three consecutive intervals of 45 min duration. Endpoints assessed were similar to those 
investigated during the study performed in anaesthetized beagle dogs. Electrophysiological and 
hemodynamic variables were monitored for at least 90 min prior to the target time for commencement of 
dosing and continued for at least 20 h following the start of the first intravenous infusion on each of the 
two test sessions. 
Following intravenous administration of the first two infusions of either dilution buffer for 
rVIII-SingleChain, or test item rVIII-SingleChain containing active FVIII, when applied at dose levels of 
50 and 250 IU/kg, some differences were noted in cardiovascular parameters, notably for blood pressure 
and LVP parameters. Since recorded values were generally lower following rVIII-SingleChain 
administration the results were therefore not considered to be attributable to treatment with the active 
ingredient of rVIII-SingleChain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 26/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly to observations made in the study performed in anaesthetized beagle dogs, following 
intravenous administration of the third infusions of either dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain or 
rVIII-SingleChain at the dose level of 1250 IU/kg, changes were observed in arterial blood pressure 
(systolic, diastolic and mean), PR and QT intervals, heart rate, LVSP, LVEDP, dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin. 
These changes were of a similar magnitude and duration after infusion of both, dilution buffer for 
rVIII-SingleChain and rVIII-SingleChain (1250 IU/kg), and were therefore not considered to be 
attributable to treatment with the active ingredient of rVIII-SingleChain. 
No effects were observed on the ECG (lead II) waveform morphology after treatment with either dilution 
buffer for rVIII-SingleChain or rVIII-SingleChain, throughout the study period. 
During the first two infusions of either dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain or rVIII-SingleChain at dose 
levels of 50 and 250 IU/kg no adverse clinical signs were observed in the dog. However, during the third 
infusion of dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain, behavioural and clinical signs resembling a pseudo 
allergic reaction such as swelling and reddening of the extremities and the face, and pale gums were 
observed, which necessitated the halting of the third and final infusion after 23 min for reasons of animal 
welfare. 
Alike, during the third infusion of rVIII-SingleChain (1250 IU/kg), clinical signs of a pseudoallergic 
reaction such as swelling around the eyes, face, neck, ears and forelimbs and reddening of the skin) were 
observed at a comparable time during the infusion (approximately +20 min), but the infusion continued 
until its scheduled completion after veterinary advice, and since the apparent effects were reversible as 
observed during the previous test session when investigating dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain. 
The coincidence of timing and duration of the clinical signs observed after treatment with both dilution 
buffer for rVIII-SingleChain and rVIII-SingleChain strongly suggests that the observed effects were not 
directly related to treatment with the test item rVIII-SingleChain, but are related to a component of the 
dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain, which was common in the applied test items during both test 
sessions. 
Taking into account the results obtained from the former study using anaesthetized dogs as well as the 
behavioural effects seen in this study using telemetered dogs, observed effects are believed to be due to 
the excipient PS80 of the rVIII-SingleChain dilution buffer for which dogs represent a notably sensitive 
species. Therefore, observed effects were not considered to be directly related to treatment with the 
active ingredient, the test item rVIII-SingleChain per se. The assumption of the PS80-induced 
cardiovascular and behavioural effects in the particularly sensitive species dog is supported by results 
obtained in the subsequent safety pharmacology study using telemetered monkeys, mimicking the dosing 
regimen of the two former studies in anaesthetized and telemetered beagle dogs as well as the subchronic 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The lack of any treatment related clinical signs and cardiovascular 
or behavioural effects found in studies using cynomolgus monkeys, indicates that the dog is likely to be 
the more sensitive species to PS80, compared to the monkey. Thus, observed effects were not considered 
to be directly attributable to treatment with rVIII-SingleChain. 
Study: Telemetric evaluation of cardiovascular effects in the conscious cynomolgus monkey 
(intravenous infusion administration).  
The potential effects of rVIII-SingleChain on electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were 
assessed in telemetered cynomolgus monkeys following a cumulative administration of increasing doses 
of rVIII-SingleChain.  
The observed differences in the PR-interval, heart rate and corresponding blood pressure were mild, rare 
and temporary. In addition, observed changes between the placebo control and rVIII-SingleChain or

dilution buffer for rVIII-SingleChain were small, dose-independent and sporadic and were therefore not 
considered to be directly related to treatment with rVIII-SingleChain. No adverse clinical signs or 
behavioural effects were observed during this study that were considered to be directly attributable to 
treatment with rVIII-SingleChain. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three PK studies after single i.v. dosing of rVIII-SingleChain were performed in monkeys and in FVIII ko 
mice (Table 2). Since i.v. administration is the only route available for administration to men, no other 
routes were tested preclinically. Further kinetic analysis was performed as part of the single and repeated 
dose toxicity studies. 
Table 2: Overview of pharmacokinetic studies 
Methods of analysis 
For measuring FVIII activity in plasma, two different test principles were used, one using a chromogenic 
assay (ChS) and one a one-stage (OS) clotting assay.  
Absorption 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: PK study and tool antibody production in cynomolgus monkeys  
The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of 
rVIII-SingleChain following a single intravenous dose at levels of 50 IU/kg and 250 IU/kg (Phase A). In 
addition, the systemic exposure following i.v. administration of rVIII-SingleChain was compared to that of 
marketed recombinant human FVIII products, i.e. Helixate and ReFacto AF. The objective of Phase B was 
– after the initial intravenous prime - to elicit a humoral immune response following repeated 
subcutaneous administration in combination with an adjuvant, for the purpose of harvesting species 
specific anti-product antibodies as an analytical tool for subsequent pivotal GLP-toxicity studies. 
Furthermore, appearance of an immune response against rVIII-SingleChain compared to ReFacto AF and 
Helixate, respectively, was investigated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 28/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the study, clinical condition, body weight, haematology, blood chemistry, bioanalytical, organ 
weight and macroscopic pathology investigations were undertaken. 
During the phase A, rVIII-SingleChain displayed similar pharmacokinetic properties when compared with 
those of ReFacto AF but exhibited a slightly lower clearance when compared to Helixate. In addition after 
comparison of the 50 IU/kg dose groups with those of the 250 IU/kg dose groups the results show that for 
both rVIII-SingleChain and Helixate approximate dose proportionality holds in particular for those 
parameters that do not involve extrapolation, i.e. Cmax,incr,obs , Cmax,incr and AUC24h.  
In terms of safety it could be concluded that single intravenous administrations of rVIII-SingleChain or 
the other FVIII concentrates (Helixate or ReFacto AF) at a dosage of 250 IU/kg to cynomolgus monkeys 
was well tolerated and did not exhibit any adverse effects of treatment with rVIII-SingleChain. 
During Phase B, active immunization after biweekly repeated subcutaneous administration of 
rVIII-SingleChain, Helixate or ReFacto AF, when administered in combination with an adjuvant at a 
dosage of 350 IU/kg, elicited a fulminant anti-FVIII-antibody immune response in all animals but was not 
well tolerated. Under conditions of an active immunization, repeated treatment with heterologous human 
FVIII products resulted in a strong neutralizing anti-FVIII antibody response, which was significantly 
cross reactive with, and hence inhibitory to endogenous FVIII and elicited haemophilia A like symptoms to 
a greater or lesser degree in all animals treated with rVIII-SingleChain, Helixate or ReFacto AF. 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: PK study in cynomolgus monkeys  
The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of rVIII-SingleChain following a single 
intravenous dose of 250 IU/kg. In addition, the systemic exposure following i.v. administration of 
rVIII-SingleChain was compared to that of marketed recombinant human FVIII product, i.e. Advate. Prior 
to plasma sample analysis venous blood samples were collected from all animals at the following 
schedule: pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h post dose. 
Following a single intravenous bolus injection, rVIII-SingleChain and the comparator formulation Advate 
were well tolerated at a dosage of 250 IU/kg, with no clinical signs or reactions to treatment observed, nor 
any injection site observations considered associated with treatment. 
Individual FVIII activities were measured using the chromogenic substrate assay. Corresponding FVIII 
plasma levels were calculated using standard human plasma as calibrator, which is calibrated from the 
manufacturer against WHO standard material. 100% of norm corresponds to 1 IU/mL FVIII. Resulting 
values were above baseline, following administration of rVIII-SingleChain and Advate up to 24 h post 
dose in all animals. Generally, for each of the formulations there were no notable differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of FVIII between sexes. 
Following administration of rVIII-SingleChain, the maximum activity of FVIII was similar to that following 
administration of Advate. 
Plasma levels of FVIII activity declined from a maximum at the first sampling time in an apparent 
bi-exponential manner with a terminal half-life ranging between 10-15 h for rVIII-SingleChain and 
ranging between 4.6-4.7 h for Advate. 
The mean C0 value following administration of rVIII-SingleChain was similar to that following 
administration of Advate. However, the mean AUCt value (% of the norm*h/mL) following administration 
of rVIII-SingleChain was 1.7-fold higher than that after administration of Advate. When comparing 
exposure extrapolated to infinity (AUC), FVIII activity was approximately 2.3 fold greater following 
administration of rVIII-SingleChain to that following administration of Advate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 29/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Accordingly, the CL value (IU/%*h) following administration of rVIII-SingleChain was approximately 
2.2-fold higher compared to Advate. The mean terminal half-life following administration of 
rVIII-SingleChain was approximately 2.7-fold longer than that after administration of Advate. 
Study: Pharmacokinetic evaluation of rFVIII/rVIII-SingleChain, Helixate, ReFacto AF and 
Advate in FVIII ko mice  
The aim of this study was to establish a comparative pharmacokinetic analysis of rVIII-SingleChain in 
haemophilia A mice (FVIII ko mice) and thereby compare the profile head-to-head with other clinically 
relevant, recombinant human FVIII products, i.e. the full length protein Helixate and Advate and the 
B-domain-deleted protein ReFacto AF.  
All test articles were injected intravenously at a clinically relevant dose of 100 IU/kg adjusted according 
to the one-stage clotting system activity of the four different test items. The subsequent determination of 
FVIII activity in plasma was performed by the chromogenic assay as well as the one-stage clotting system 
at different time points after administration of the four different test items. 
The overall pharmacokinetic properties of rVIII-SingleChain did not differ largely from the other marketed 
recombinant human FVIII products Helixate, ReFacto AF or Advate when keeping the analytical system 
the same by adjusting the applied dose and measuring the respective FVIII:C plasma levels with either 
the chromogenic system or the one-stage clotting system. Hence this particular set up may reflect and 
predict the human pharmacokinetics and in turn the haemostatic efficacy in haemophilia A individuals 
most appropriately. The favourable PK profile of rVIII-SingleChain compared to other recombinant FVIII 
concentrates in Haemophilia A mice is consistent with the observations obtained in a cynomolgus monkey 
study when administering rVIII-SingleChain at doses of 50 IU/kg and 250 IU/kg.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The i.v. single dose toxicity of rVIII-SingleChain was evaluated in rats and monkeys using doses of up to 
1500 IU/kg. 
Repeat-dose toxicity of rVIII-SingleChain was evaluated in rats and monkeys. In rats rVIII-SingleChain 
was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 250 and 1250 IU/kg on 28 consecutive days followed by 
a 14 day recovery phase. In monkeys rVIII-SingleChain was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 
150 and 500 IU/kg on 28 consecutive days. 
Assessment report

Local tolerance investigations were included in the single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Furthermore, a separate local tolerance study was performed in rabbits assessing potential effects of 
rVIII-SingleChain if applied according to the intended clinical route as well as in case an aberrant 
administration would occur. 
The potential prothrombotic risk of rVIII-SingleChain was addressed in the venous-stasis-induced 
thrombosis model (modified Wessler test). 
Table 3: Overview of toxicology studies 
Single dose toxicity 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Single dose toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to 
rats.  
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rVIII-SingleChain was assessed over a 5 day period 
following a single dose by intravenous (bolus) administration in CD rats. Three groups, each comprising 
five male and five female rats received rVIII-SingleChain at doses of 50, 250 or 1500 IU/kg. A similarly 
constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) at the same volume-dose as the highest treated 
dose group (3.61 mL/kg). A further 3 males and 3 females were allocated to the control group and 9 
males and 9 females were allocated to each treatment group (n=3 per group). These animals were used 
for toxicokinetic evaluation. During the study, clinical condition, mortality, body weight, food 
consumption, haematology, blood chemistry, toxicokinetics, urinalysis, organ weight, macropathology

and histopathology investigations were undertaken. Blood samples for toxicokinetic evaluation were 
taken at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. 
A single intravenous (bolus) injection of rVIII-SingleChain at doses up to 1500 IU/kg was well tolerated in 
the rat with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity and no irritation at the site of injection. Therefore, 
under the conditions of this study, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) is considered to be 
1500 IU/kg. 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Single dose toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to 
cynomolgus monkeys.  
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rVIII-SingleChain was also assessed in a single dose 
study by intravenous (bolus) administration in cynomolgus monkeys. Three groups of 3 male and 3 
female monkeys received a single dose of rVIII-SingleChain at 50, 250 or 1500 IU/kg on study day 1. A 
similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) at the same frequency. Two male and 
two female animals from each group were killed on day 6 of the study, and the remaining 1 male and 1 
female from each group were killed on day 11.  
A single intravenous bolus injection of rVIII-SingleChain at doses up to 1500 IU/kg was well tolerated in 
cynomolgus monkeys with no effects observed. Under the conditions of this study, the NOAEL was 
considered to be 1500 IU/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to CD rats for 4 
weeks followed by a 14 day recovery period.  
The systemic toxic potential of rVIII-SingleChain to CD rats by intravenous (bolus) administration 
including toxicokinetics was assessed over a period of up to 4 weeks. The potential for any 
treatment-related effects to show recovery was assessed in a subsequent 2-week recovery period in 
selected animals. Five male and five female animals from each group were killed on day 6 as part of the 
interim kill to investigate initial toxicity before the development of any potential immune response against 
the heterologous human protein.  
The administration of rVIII-SingleChain by intravenous (bolus) injection at doses up to 1250 IU/kg/day 
for 6 or 28 days was well tolerated in the rat with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity. An immune 
response resulting in the formation of antibodies against rVIII-SingleChain was apparent within the 
rVIII-SingleChain treated groups after 16 and 28 days of treatment, but there are no indications that this 
prevented an assessment of the toxicity of rVIII-SingleChain. Under the conditions of this study, the 
NOAEL is considered to be 1250 IU/kg. 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Toxicity study by intravenous bolus administration to cynomolgus 
monkeys for 4 weeks.  
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rVIII-SingleChain to cynomolgus monkeys by 
intravenous (bolus) administration was also assessed over a period of 4 weeks, with a day 6 interim 
period. Three groups of 3 male and 3 female monkeys received rVIII-SingleChain at doses of 50, 150 or 
500 IU/kg/day for 4 weeks. A similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) with the 
same frequency as the treated groups but at a dose volume similar to the high dose group. A further one 
male and one female monkey were assigned to each group; these animals were dosed for 5 days and 
were killed on day 6 to investigate initial toxicity before the onset of any potential immune response 
against the heterologous human protein. During the study, clinical condition, mortality, bodyweight, 
ophthalmic examination, electrocardiography, blood pressure, haematology, blood chemistry,

toxicokinetics, antibody analysis, urinalysis, organ weight, macropathology and histopathology 
investigations were undertaken. 
Administration of rVIII-SingleChain by intravenous (bolus) injection at doses up to 500 IU/kg was well 
tolerated in the cynomolgus monkey. An immune response resulting in the formation of antibodies 
against rVIII-SingleChain was apparent within the rVIII-SingleChain treated groups after 13 and 28 days 
of treatment. Under the conditions of this study, the NOAEL is considered to be the highest dose tested, 
i.e. 500 IU/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproduction studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). Nonetheless, macro- 
and histopathological investigations of male and female reproductive organs have been included in the 
single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies (rats and monkeys) with no findings indicative of adverse 
toxicity. 
Local Tolerance  
Study: rVIII-SingleChain: Local tolerance study in the rabbit following intravenous, 
intra-arterial or perivenous injection.  
This study investigated the local tolerance of rVIII-SingleChain in rabbits when reconstituted in water for 
injection and administered once by intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous route.  
There was no sign of toxicity or ill health in any rabbit during the observation period and bodyweight gain 
was considered to have been unaffected by treatment.  
Overall, intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous injection of rVIII-SingleChain was well tolerated with 
no local or systemic sign of reaction to treatment. In-life, macropathological and histological findings were 
considered to be due to the administration procedure. 
Other toxicity studies 
Study: rVIII-SingleChain (rFVIII): In vivo thrombogenicity test in the rabbit (modified 
Wessler test as described by Giles, A.R. 1980). 
To determine the risk of thrombogenicity of rVIII-SingleChain, a thrombosis model was used which is 
technologically based on the induction of a temporary venous stasis by ligation of an appropriate vein. 
Thrombosis incidence and thrombus dry weight were then used as parameters for evaluation and 
comparison. In the present thrombogenicity study, the potential pro-thrombogenic effects of 
rVIII-SingleChain were evaluated at doses of 150, 300, 500 and 1000 IU/kg, when given via the i.v. route 
to 6 rabbits (3 females / 3 males) per dose and group. Twelve rabbits (6 females / 6 males) received 
physiological saline and acted as placebo group (negative control). FEIBA NF 500 (factor eight bypassing 
activity) was included in the study to act as a positive control, since it contains activated and

multiple sites. Since FEIBA NF 500 lacks FVIII, ReFacto AF was included as an additional comparator, 
comprising a non-activated rFVIII molecule. As a primary endpoint, incidence of thrombosis in both 
jugular veins after venous stasis was assessed. 
rVIII-SingleChain showed only a minimal prothrombotic potential at the highest administered dose of 
1000 IU/kg with no statistically significant effects at the lower doses of 150, 300 or 500 IU/kg, leading to 
the designation of a NOAEL of 500 IU/kg. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Afstyla is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor VIII. It is 
catabolized during human metabolism and no active molecule is excreted by the patient. In accordance 
with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), Afstyla as a protein is exempted from an environmental risk 
assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Concerning pharmacology one in-vivo pharmacodynamic study was performed in coagulation Factor VIII 
deficient mice (FVIII knockout mice). Here, the i.v. administration of rVIII-SingleChain, respectively, 
revealed a significant dose-dependent reduction of total blood loss, time to haemostasis and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) compared to the control group. The effects were comparable to other 
FVIII products, i.e. Helixate, ReFacto and Advate. 
Originally, safety pharmacology investigations in terms of cardiovascular variables were included in the 
28 repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys. Here, the electrophysiology of the heart as well as blood 
pressure and pulse rate measurements were considered unaffected by Afstyla treatment. 
The investigation of potential neuro-behavioural effects of Afstyla was integrated in the 28 repeat-dose 
toxicity study in rats. There were no treatment related changes to the clinical signs observed during the 
Irwin assessment. Further, there were no macroscopic or histopathological changes observed which were 
considered to be indicative of an effect on the central nervous system. 
A further in depth investigation of potential effects of Afstyla on hemodynamic and electrophysiological 
parameters was conducted in dogs and monkeys, whereas the potential impact on respiratory variables 
was assessed in dogs only. 
Unexpectedly, during the study conducted in anaesthetized beagle dogs statistically significant and 
pharmacologically relevant falls in cardiovascular parameters, i.e. arterial blood pressure, LVSP, LVEDP, 
Cardiac Output and Stroke Volume, following intravenous administration of the third infusion of Afstyla at 
the highest dose level of 1250 IU/kg were recorded, which had not been observed following treatment 
with 0.9% w/v saline. However, in the study using treatment of telemetered monkeys with either 0.9% 
saline or dilution buffer for Afstyla, when used as placebo control and vehicle control, respectively in 
comparison with Afstyla per se revealed no treatment related clinical signs on any of the behavioural or 
cardiovascular variables at cumulative doses of 1550 IU/kg. As it is known that dogs are PS80 sensitive, 
the cardiovascular and respiratory effects observed in study in dogs and the behavioural effects seen in 
the subsequent study in telemetered dogs, were considered to be due to the excipient PS80 of the 
rVIII-SingleChain dilution buffer, and not directly related to the treatment with the active ingredient. 
Based on the mechanism of action of rVIII-SingleChain, representing a human blood coagulation factor, 
no secondary pharmacodynamic effects were expected. There were also no indications for secondary 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 34/103 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacodynamic effects observed during primary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacological or 
toxicological investigations. This was considered acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In monkeys, Afstyla displayed similar pharmacokinetic properties when compared with those of ReFacto 
AF but exhibited a slightly lower clearance when compared to Helixate. In addition after comparison of the 
50 IU/kg dose groups with those of the 250 IU/kg dose groups the results show that for both Afstyla and 
Helixate approximate dose proportionality holds in particular for those parameters that do not involve 
extrapolation, i.e. Cmax,incr,obs , Cmax,incr and AUC24h. In a second study in monkeys PK of 250 IU/kg, Afstyla 
was compared to that of Advate. Here, the mean terminal half-life following administration of Afstyla was 
approximately 2.7-fold longer than that after administration of Advate. 
In FVIII deficient mice the overall pharmacokinetic properties of Afstyla were slightly superior, but did not 
differ largely from the other marketed recombinant human FVIII concentrates Helixate, ReFacto AF or 
Advate when adjusting the applied dose of Afstyla and measuring the respective FVIII:C plasma levels by 
the identical analytical test system, either the chromogenic system or the one-stage clotting system, and 
comparator properties were analysed according to their labelled potency dose. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic studies submitted are considered sufficient and appropriate to support 
marketing authorisation. 
Toxicology 
Single intravenous (bolus) injection of Afstyla at doses up to 1500 IU/kg was well tolerated in the rat with 
no findings indicative of adverse toxicity and no irritation at the site of injection. Similarly single 
intravenous bolus injection of Asftyla at doses up to 1500 IU/kg was well tolerated in cynomolgus 
monkeys with no effects observed. Accordingly, for both studies the NOAEL was considered to be 1500 
IU/kg. 
Repeat-dose toxicity of Afstyla was also evaluated in rats and monkeys. In rats the administration of 
Afstyla by intravenous (bolus) injection at doses of 50, 250 or 1250 IU/kg/day for 6 or 28 days was well 
tolerated with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity. An immune response resulting in the formation of 
antibodies against Afstyla was apparent within the Afstyla treated groups after 16 and 28 days of 
treatment, but there are no indications that this prevented an assessment of the toxicity of Afstyla. Under 
the conditions of this study, the NOAEL was considered to be 1250 IU/kg. 
In monkeys Afstyla was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 150 and 500 IU/kg on 28 consecutive 
days. Administration of Afstyla by intravenous (bolus) injection at doses up to 500 IU/kg was well 
tolerated. An immune response resulting in the formation of antibodies against Afstyla was apparent 
within the Afstyla treated groups after 13 and 28 days of treatment. Under the conditions of this study, 
the NOAEL was considered to be the highest dose tested, i.e. 500 IU/kg.  
Genotoxicity studies were not submitted as the active components of rVIII-SingleChain are recombinant 
counterparts of naturally occurring human plasma proteins. As mutagenic effects of FVIII were not 
expected, since there is no direct interaction with DNA to anticipate damage of DNA or interaction with 
DNA binding proteins, no studies with regard to the mutagenic potential of rVIII-SingleChain have been 
performed. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not submitted in accordance with ICH S6 R1 and as the active component of 
rVIII-SingleChain is a recombinant counterpart of naturally occurring human plasma proteins, 
carcinogenicity studies are not regarded to be required and have not been performed.

A local tolerance study was performed in rabbits. Here intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous injection 
of Afstyla was well tolerated with no local or systemic sign of reaction to treatment. Macro-pathological 
and histological findings were considered to be due to the administration procedure. Furthermore, local 
tolerance investigations were included in the single dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies (in rats and 
monkeys) showing good tolerability of Afstyla following i.v. administration. 
A thrombogenicity study was conducted to evaluate the prothrombotic potential of Afstyla using the 
modified Wessler Test (as described by Giles, 1980). Here, Afstyla showed only a minimal prothrombotic 
potential at the highest administered dose of 1000 IU/kg with no statistically significant effects at the 
lower doses of 150, 300 or 500 IU/kg, leading to the designation of a NOAEL of 500 IU/kg. 
Afstyla is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor VIII. It is 
catabolized during human metabolism and no active molecule is excreted by the patient. In accordance 
with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), Afstyla as a protein is exempted from an environmental risk 
assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical data submitted as part of this application reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity studies, local tolerability 
and thrombogenicity assessments.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of rVIII-SingleChain was investigated throughout the clinical development program in studies 
1001 and 3002.  
•  Study 1001: Pharmacokinetics in Subjects ≥ 12 to ≤ 65 Years of Age: 
Study 1001 was an open-label, non-randomized, phase I / III study to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK 
of rVIII-SingleChain in subjects with severe haemophilia A for the prevention and treatment of bleeding 
episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis. The study consisted of 3 parts: 
• Part 1 compared the single-dose PK of rVIII-SingleChain with Advate in 27 subjects ≥ 18 years 
• Part 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of rVIII-SingleChain in subjects continuing from Part 1 
• Part 3 assessed the safety, efficacy, PK of rVIII-SingleChain in 64 subjects ≥ 12 years and a repeat PK 
investigation in 30 of these 64 subjects, conducted 3 to 6 months after the initial investigation. Within 
Part 3 also a comparison of the PK of the low-strength and high-strength formulations of 
rVIII-SingleChain was performed.  
•  Study 3002: Pharmacokinetics in Subjects 0 to < 12 Years of Age: 
Study 3002 was an open-label, multicenter, phase III study to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of 
rVIII-SingleChain in subjects from 0 to < 12 years of age with severe haemophilia A. The study consists 
of a PK evaluation period, wherein PK data are assessed by a single dose of rVIII-SingleChain (50 IU/kg), 
and a treatment period, wherein subjects are treated with rVIII-SingleChain in an on-demand or 
prophylaxis regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 37/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PK investigation of rVIII-SingleChain in 39 subjects 0 to < 12 years were performed (thereof 20 subjects 
0 to < 6 years, 19 subjects ≥ 6 to < 12 years). Furthermore a population PK analysis was conducted on 
the combined data from study 1001 and study 3002. 
Analytical methods 
Throughout the rVIII-SingleChain clinical development program, 8 assays were validated and employed 
to measure the following: FVIII activity measured with a one-stage clotting [OS] and chromogenic [ChS] 
assays, inhibitors against FVIII, non-inhibitory anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) (3 assays, including 1 
screening and 2 confirmatory assays), and antibodies against CHO host cell proteins (2 assays, including 
1 screening and 1 confirmatory assay). 
Comparative Pharmacokinetics in Subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 Years of Age 
For the PK evaluation in Study 1001, Part 1, 27 subjects (≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years of age) first received a single 
injection of Advate (50 IU/kg) after a washout period of at least 4 days from any prior FVIII treatment. 
After another 4-day washout period after the Advate injection, the same subjects received a single 
injection of rVIII-SingleChain (50 IU/kg). The PK samples were collected before injection and at specific 
time points up to 72 h after injection of Advate and rVIII-SingleChain (time points: pre, 30 min, 1, 4, 8, 
10, 24, 32, 48, 72h post-dose for both products). 
Based on the dose-adjusted ChS assay data, mean values for AUC were higher, mean CL was lower, and 
mean t1/2 was longer with rVIII-SingleChain than Advate. The mean Cmax and IR values were similar 
between rVIII-SingleChain and Advate.

rVIII-SingleChain and Advate for Subjects Dosed at 50 IU/kg (Non-compartmental Analysis;

Non-compartmental PK analysis across all age groups 
In the non-compartmental PK analysis across age groups, the PK parameters of subjects ≥ 12 to < 18 
years and subjects ≥ 18 to ≤65 years were similar (table 5). Mean CL was higher in subjects 0 to < 12 
years than in subjects ≥ 12 to ≤ 65 years (4.86 vs. 3.15 mL/h/kg, respectively), with consequently lower 
mean AUC and t1/2 values. The highest mean CL values and the lowest mean AUC values were observed 
in the youngest age group (subjects 0 to < 6 years).

after Initial Injection of rVIII-SingleChain for Subjects Dosed at 50 IU/kg 
(Non-compartmental Analysis; PK Populations, Study 1001 and Study 3002, ChS Assay): 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A total of 130 subjects from Studies 1001 and 3002 (age range of 0 to ≤ 65 years) contributed 1460 FVIII 
activity data points that were used in the population PK analysis of FVIII activity after IV injection of 50 
IU/kg rVIII-SingleChain. A non-linear mixed effects model (NONMEM) was applied using NONMEM 
Version 7.2. 
The PK for rVIII-SingleChain was described well by a 2-compartmental i.v. model of a combined additive 
and proportional residual error model, with central volume of distribution (V1), CL, peripheral volume of 
distribution (V2), and inter-compartmental clearance (Q) as disposition parameters.

Of all the covariates assessed (total body weight, age, body mass index, race, aspartate 
aminotransferase levels, alanine aminotransferase levels, creatinine clearance, baseline VWF levels, 
hematocrit, hepatitis positivity, the presence of ADAs, and geographical region), total body weight and 
baseline VWF levels had statistically significant influences on CL, and total body weight had a statistically 
significant influence on V1. 
Model-based PK simulations of FVIII activity were performed for 20 to 50 IU/kg doses of rVIII-SingleChain 
after a single injection and after repeat injections every second day, every 3 days, 2 times weekly (on Day 
0 and Day 3, or on Day 0 and Day 3.5), or 3 times weekly (on Day 0, Day 2, and Day 4, or on Day 0, Day 
2, and Day 4.5) in subjects 0 to ≤ 65 years of age (table 6).

Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Study 1001 compared the PK from the initial dose (64 subjects) and the repeated dose (30 subjects) over 
3-6 months. No significant difference in PK profiles was observed between the initial and repeated doses.

Gender:

Race: 
In the covariate analysis of the population PK model, race (white, black or African American, Asian, other) 
was not found to have a statistically significant influence on CL or V1. 
Elderly: 
No subjects > 65 years were enrolled in any of the clinical studies. Therefore, no PK data in the elderly 
were generated. 
Paediatrics: 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rVIII-SingleChain in children (i.e. subjects 0 to <12 years of age) was 
evaluated within Study 3002. PK was assessed after a single dose of rFVIII-SingleChain (50 IU/kg). Blood 
samples were taken before injection and at specific sampling time points up to 48 h after injection (1, 5, 
10, 24, 48 h). 
The PK of Afstyla was evaluated in 10 previously treated adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) and 39 
previously treated children (0 to <12 years of age) following an intravenous injection of a single dose 
of 50 IU/kg. All patients had been diagnosed with severe haemophilia A with <1% factor VIII.  
The PK parameters presented here are based on plasma factor VIII activity measured by the 
chromogenic substrate assay. 
As expected, differences in PK were seen between children (0 to < 12 years) in Study 3002 and 
adults/adolescents ≥ 12 to ≤ 65) in Study 1001. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Neither  in  vitro  Cytochrome  P  450  hepatic  drug  metabolism  nor  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were 
considered applicable for the in vitro investigation of rVIII-SingleChain. rVIII-SingleChain is a therapeutic 
protein metabolized by the same catabolic pathways as endogenous FVIII and results in the same amino 
acid fragments. 
Special studies- immunogenicity 
The PK findings corroborate those of the immunogenicity testing. No FVIII inhibitor development or 
antibodies against CHO host cell proteins were detected for any tested subject receiving 
rVIII-SingleChain. The 14 subjects with PK data (4 in Study 1001, 10 in Study 3002) who tested positive 
for non-inhibitory ADAs at any time did not have any relevant differences in their FVIII activity profiles or 
PK parameters compared to the 116 subjects with PK data who tested negative for ADAs. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamics studies were conducted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Chromogenic and one-stage clotting assay as used throughout all clinical studies have been validated. For 
both assay types, variance lies within the acceptable range.

A factor 1.8 [x] (x defined as OS FVIII activity) most closely aligns OS activity results with ChS activity 
results. The information of discrepancy between OS and ChS assay results and the use of a correction 
factor is given in posology section 4.2 of the SmPC. The conversion factor was changed from 1.8 to 2 in 
order to facilitate the use in clinical practice and to align with authorisation recommendations in other 
countries. Both conversion factors 1.8 and 2 are within the currently accepted range of variability in 
clinical practice and provide an equally acceptable value to monitor post-infusion plasma samples in 
patients treated with rVIII-SingleChain.Pharmacokinetics of Afstyla (lonoctocog alfa) was evaluated in a 
total of 130 previously treated male patients suffering from severe haemophilia A (<1%) in two pivotal 
studies, i.e. CSL627_1001 (adults and adolescents) and CSL627_3002 (children). 
Absorption studies were not conducted since the route of administration is I.V.; no distribution studies 
were performed since Afstyla contains a recombinant endogenous FVIII protein and metabolism, 
elimination or excretion studies are not applicable since rFVIII is an endogenous protein that is 
catabolized via normal physiological pathways. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted, since 
no drug interaction is expected given the close comparability of Afstyla to the native human FVIII. These 
omissions are considered to be acceptable. 
In study 1001 part 1 PK of lonoctocog alfa was compared with PK of Advate in 27 patients. In brief, PK of 
rFVIII-Single Chain and Advate are comparable. rFVIII-Single Chain revealed slightly higher t½ and AUC 
values whereas the clearance was somewhat reduced in comparison to Advate. However, these 
differences are not considered clinically relevant. The applicant did not claim different posology 
recommendations but used the posology wording as suggested by the Core SPC, which is supported. 
According to the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant factor VIII and IX products, the 
applicant compared initial and repeat PK. Based on the data provided it is agreed to the applicant that 
there are no obvious differences between initial and repeat PK.  
As requested by the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant factor VIII and IX products, a PK 
comparison of high- and low-strength formulations of rVIII-SingleChain was performed. Furthermore, 
there was no clinically relevant effect of rVIII-SingleChain lot on the PK of FVIII following either single or 
repeat IV injections at a dose of 50 IU/kg. 
In terms of paediatric patients PK data are available from 39 patients (20 in the age group 0 to <6 years 
and 19 in the age group ≥6 to <12 years). In adolescents i.e. ≥12 to <18 years, PK was evaluated in 10 
patients. Overall, PK data in these age groups is considered sufficient.  
No PK data in the elderly were generated as no subjects > 65 years were enrolled in any of the clinical 
studies. This is in line with the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant factor VIII and IX 
products. 
Population PK simulations support the proposed prophylactic dosing regimen of 20 to 50 IU/kg 
rVIII-SingleChain 2 times weekly and 3 times weekly as the simulations predict that the majority of 
subjects, i.e. approximately 54% to 98% would maintain their trough total activity at >1% at all times. In 
the younger children (<6yrs) in the lowest dose groups 20 IU/kg 2 times weekly, less than 50% achieve 
FVIII trough levels >1%. Accordingly, the applicant proposed to increase the recommended starting dose 
from 20 to 50 IU/kg 2 to 3 times weekly to 30 to 50 IU/kg 2 to 3 times weekly for children <12yrs. 
No specific pharmacodynamics studies were conducted as the PD effects of FVIII are closely associated 
with its PK parameters. This was considered acceptable.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK of rVIII-SingleChain has been thoroughly characterised in a sufficient number of patients across all age 
groups. Requirements for PK investigations as laid down in the Guideline on the clinical investigation of 
recombinant factor VIIIand IX products have been fulfilled. Furthermore, differences between results 
from OS and ChS assay have been addressed. Looking at ChS results, lonoctocog alfa does exert a PK 
profile comparable with other recombinant FVIII concentrates.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  recombinant  human  coagulation  factor  VIII,  single  chain  (rVIII-SingleChain)  clinical  development 
program  includes  two  completed  studies  (CSL627_1001  and  CSL627_3002)  and  one  ongoing  study 
(CSL627_3001) in subjects with severe haemophilia A. 
2.5.1.  Dose response and main clinical studies  
The rVIII-SingleChain clinical program was designed to determine the PK profile, safety and efficacy of 
rVIII-SingleChain in adult and pediatric subjects with haemophilia A (FVIII activity < 1%) and consists of 
3 studies (1001, 3002 and 3001).

Study 1001: (Subjects ≥ 12 to ≤ 65 Years) 
Study 1001 was an open-label, non-randomized, phase I / III study in male subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years of 
age (Part 1 and Part 2), and ≥ 12 to ≤ 65 years of age (Part 3) with severe haemophilia A (residual FVIII 
activity < 1%). To be enrolled in this study, subjects were required to have received a FVIII replacement 
product for > 150 EDs and have no history of FVIII inhibitors. The study consisted of 3 parts (Figure 
3.4.1). Part 1 was a single-dose, crossover, PK comparison of Advate (50 IU/kg) and rVIII-SingleChain 
(50 IU/kg). 
Part 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of on-demand and prophylaxis regimens with continued dosing of 
rVIII-SingleChain in subjects from Part 1. Part 3 assessed the safety and efficacy of on-demand and 
prophylaxis regimens with rVIII-SingleChain in newly enrolled subjects, and included initial and repeat PK 
assessments of rVIII-SingleChain in a subgroup of subjects. The study also included a surgical substudy 
for subjects enrolled in Parts 2 and 3. 
Subjects in Parts 2 and 3 were to be treated until at least 104 subjects had reached 50 EDs to assess the 
risk of inhibitor formation as requested by the FDA. Thereafter, all subjects could roll over into Extension 
Study 3001.

• 
Treatments 
Phase 1/3 Study in adults and adolescents ≥12 to ≤65 years of age (study 1001) 
Study 1001 (pivotal adult / adolescent study, completed) was a phase I / III open-label, multicenter, 
crossover safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) study of rVIII-SingleChain compared to Advate in 
subjects with haemophilia A, and a repeat PK, safety, and efficacy study of rVIII-SingleChain. This study 
included a surgical substudy. 
rVIII-SingleChain and Advate were administered as iv injections, with actual doses based on the subject’s 
body weight. 
Part 1 
In Part 1 of the study, subjects were to receive a single iv dose of 50 IU/kg Advate on Day 1, after a 4-day 
wash-out period. Blood draws for the full PK analysis were to be performed up to 72 h after injection. 
Subjects would then wait 1 additional day to achieve a 4-day wash-out period before receiving a dose of 
rVIII-SingleChain at 50 IU/kg, followed by blood draws for the full PK analysis up to 72 h after injection. 
At the conclusion of the 72 h PK blood collection for rVIII-SingleChain, subjects were to complete the 
follow-up visit and begin the on-demand or prophylaxis treatment period in Part 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 46/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Part 2 
After subjects completed the PK follow-up assessment in Part 1, they were to start the on-demand or 
prophylaxis treatment period with rVIII-SingleChain. The first 5 subjects that continued into Part 2 were 
assigned to an on-demand regimen, to ensure that the haemostatic potential of rVIII-SingleChain was 
adequate  based  on  treatment  of  bleeding  episodes.  After  establishing  the  haemostatic  potential,  the 
remaining subjects from Part 1 continuing to Part 2 could be assigned to either an on-demand regimen or 
prophylaxis. 
All prophylaxis subjects were to receive rVIII-SingleChain at a dose of 20 to 40 IU/kg body weight every 
other day or 20 to 50 IU/kg body weight 2 to 3 times per week, or at other doses and frequencies at the 
investigator’s discretion. 
All on-demand treatment subjects were to receive rVIII-SingleChain at a dose similar to the FVIII product 
used prior to enrollment for the same type of bleeding event, and continue in the study until 50 EDs or 
until at least 104 subjects reached 50 EDs. 
Part 3 
Part  3  was  initiated  following  the  collection  and  evaluation  of  the  interim  Part  1  PK  analysis,  which 
confirmed the acceptability of following the WFH dosing for the expanded cohort (Part 3). At least 13 new 
subjects were to participate in the full PK evaluation of rVIII-SingleChain and should have received a 
single dose of 50 IU/kg. Repeat PK analysis, using the same strength of rVIII-SingleChain, was to be 
performed after 3 to 6 months. After the initial PK, subjects were to then begin on-demand or prophylaxis 
treatment and continue treatment for at least 50 EDs or until at least 104 subjects reached 50 EDs. 
Perioperative prophylaxis treatment (Parts 2 and 3) 
For  subjects  entering  this  part  of  the  study,  the  dose  regimen  of  rVIII-SingleChain  was  to  be 
individualized based on the type of surgery and the clinical status of the subject. 
Prophylaxis treatment regimen 
The investigator determined the rVIII-SingleChain prophylaxis dose and dosing schedule for the subject 
based upon the subject’s PK profile (if available), rVIII-SingleChain PK profile, previous FVIII treatment 
regimen,  bleeding  phenotype  (if  available),  and  taking  into  consideration  the  World  Federation  of 
Haemophilia  (WFH)  guidelines  [WFH,  2012].  In  the  previous  pivotal  studies,  most  subjects  received 
prophylaxis treatment with an initial range of 20 to 50 IU/kg rVIII-SingleChain 2 to 3 times per week. 
On-demand treatment of bleeding episodes 
In the event of a bleeding episode, subjects were treated at a dose pre-determined by the investigator 
based on the type and severity of the bleeding episode. All subjects were to treat bleeding episodes with 
rVIII-SingleChain when they occurred, regardless of the assigned treatment regimen. The desired FVIII 
level for the treatment of a bleeding episode (on-demand treatment) was based on the recommendations 
of the WFH [WFH, 2012]. 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were to characterize the PK profile of rVIII-SingleChain, to demonstrate efficacy in 
the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes, to demonstrate the efficacy of a routine prophylaxis 
regimen over an on-demand regimen, to demonstrate the efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in surgical 
prophylaxis, and to characterize the rate of inhibitor formation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 47/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary objectives were to characterize the safety profile of rVIII-SingleChain and to compare the 
PK profile of rVIII-SingleChain to Advate. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Control and prevention of bleeding episodes: rate of treatment success for bleeding episodes 
defined as a rating of “excellent” or “good” on the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of 
haemostatic efficacy 4-point scale   
To estimate the rate of treatment success, the numerator included the number of bleeding 
episodes treated with rVIII-SingleChain and rated as “excellent” or “good”, and the denominator 
included all treated bleeding episodes. In the primary analysis, treated bleeding episodes with 
missing investigator ratings were counted as treatment failures. In the 2 sensitivity analyses, 
bleeding episodes with missing investigator ratings were either excluded from the calculation, or 
counted as treatment successes.  
•  Routine prophylaxis: annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR), comparison of on-demand 
regimen to prophylaxis regimen 
• 
Perioperative prophylaxis: rate of treatment success during the surgical substudy defined as an 
investigator rating of “excellent” or “good” on a 4-point efficacy evaluation of surgical treatment 
scale  
The secondary and other efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Control and prevention of bleeding episodes: number of injections of rVIII-SingleChain required 
to achieve hemostasis, rate of treatment success for major bleeding episodes defined as a rating 
of “excellent” or “good” on the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
4-point scale, and consumption of rVIII-SingleChain 
•  Routine prophylaxis: ABR and consumption of rVIII-SingleChain 
• 
Perioperative prophylaxis: consumption of rVIII-SingleChain during surgical prophylaxis, 
predicted and estimated blood loss during surgery, predicted and actual transfusion requirements 
during surgery, change in hemoglobin levels between baseline, intra-operation and 
post-operation 
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of FVIII inhibitors associated with the use of 
rVIII-SingleChain. Safety was also assessed by adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), 
local tolerability at the site of injection, laboratory safety parameters, measurement of non-inhibitory 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and antibodies against CHO host cell proteins, vital signs before and after 
injection, and physical examination. 
• 
Sample size 
Approximately 30 subjects were to be enrolled into Part 1 of the study, to ensure 26 evaluable subjects for 
the PK comparison (all subjects receiving comparator first, then Afstyla).  Under the assumption that the 
expected ratio of means is 1, a coefficient of variation of 0.300, and an equivalence margin of 0.8 – 1.2, 
it was calculated that a TOST with alpha = 2.5% (1-sided per test) had about 80% power to confirm 
equivalence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 48/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To ensure at least 104 subjects evaluable for inhibitor development, approximately 100 additional 
subjects were to be enrolled in part 3. It was assumed that at most 2 subjects out of 104 would develop 
an inhibitor during the study. This would maintain an upper 95%-CI within an acceptable upper bound of 
6.8% (FDA requirement).

Statistical methods 
Inhibitor development, haemostatic efficacy and bleeding events were key parameter of interest in study 
CLS627_1001.  
Inhibitor formation was defined as any inhibitor (≥ 0.6 BU/mL) identified and confirmed by re-testing. 
For estimating the inhibitor incidence, the numerator included all subjects with inhibitors regardless of 
EDs to rVIII-SingleChain; and the denominator included subjects with at least 50 EDs plus subjects with 
less than 50 EDs but with inhibitors. A 2-sided 95% exact CI for the incidence of inhibitor formation was 
calculated. If zero inhibitors were observed, then a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit was calculated. 
SAS’ FREQ procedure was applied to produce an exact CI, which used the Clopper-Pearson CI as the 
default method. Success was achieved if the upper confidence limit was less than the acceptable upper 
limit of 6.8%. 
The rate of successfully treated bleeding episodes (i.e. investigator assessment of ‘excellent / good’) was 
calculated including the corresponding 95% CI. The 95%-CI was calculated applying a repeated 
measures model using generalized estimating equations and an independent correlation structure to 
account for within-subject correlation. The following treated bleeds were considered treatment failures: 
investigator assessment of moderate/ poor/none; treated with products other than rFVIII-SingleChain; 
having missing investigator ratings.  
The AsBR defined by: 365.25*(number of spontaneous bleeding episodes) / (observed treatment period 
of interest). 
(only spontaneous bleeding episodes requiring treatment outside the PK and surgical periods were 
included). The AsBR was presented for various subgroups by means of descriptive statistical 
characteristics. The primary comparison of interest for AsBR was the comparison between the prophylaxis 
arm and the on- demand arm. A Poisson regression model was used to test the null hypothesis of no 
difference regarding AsBR between both groups. The corresponding prophylaxis/on demand ratio with 
95% CI was also presented. As a secondary analysis, the AsBR with prophylaxis treatment on study 
CSL627-1001 was compared to that of an on-demand/prevention historical control (data from Biostate 
study CSLCT-BIO-07-47); again applying poisson regression. 
A hierarchical approach was used to deal with the multiplicity resulting from the assessment of the key 
parameter: 
The procedure started with inhibitor development.  If the upper limit of the 97.5%-CI for the risk of 
inhibitor development was greater than 6.8%, the study would have failed and further testing stopped. 
Otherwise testing proceeded to the evaluation of haemostatic efficacy for the treatment of bleeding

episodes. If the lower limit of the 95% CI for the observed rate of successfully treated bleeds would be 
less than 70%, then the study would have failed on this endpoint and further testing would be stopped. 
Otherwise, testing proceeded to the AsBR. If a test of the null hypothesis of no difference between the 
prophylaxis and the on-demand groups was not rejected at the two-sided 0.05 level, then the study would 
have failed on this endpoint and further testing stopped.

Of the 204 subjects screened, 175 subjects were enrolled, 174 subjects comprised the Safety Population, 
and 173 subjects comprised the Efficacy Population. One subject was excluded from the Efficacy 
Population because he withdrew from the study before treatment with rVIII-SingleChain in Part 2. 
Seventeen subjects (13 on the prophylaxis regimen and 4 using the on-demand regimen) were excluded 
from the PP Population due to lack of compliance with the prescribed dose or the prescribed prophylaxis 
regimen. The PP Population thus comprised 156 subjects. 
The Surgical Population comprised 13 subjects (3 subjects in the on-demand group and 10 subjects in the 
prophylaxis group) who received at least 1 dose of rVIII-SingleChain during the surgical substudy (Table 
7).

Of the 848 treated bleeding episodes, 835 were assessed by the investigator for haemostatic efficacy, and 
783 were assessed as “excellent” or “good” (ie, as treatment successes). In the primary analysis (ie, 
missing assessments counted as treatment failures), the rate of treatment success was 92.3%. When 
missing assessments were excluded, the rate of treatment success was 93.8% overall. The rate of 
treatment success was similar between treatment regimens (94.5% [on-demand] and 92.2% 
[prophylaxis]), and between the 2 age groups (95.7%[≥ 12 to < 18 years] and 93.7% [≥ 18 to ≤ 65 
years]). 
All treated bleeding episodes were considered as minor or moderate. In 93.5% of treated bleeding 
episodes, 1 or 2 injections of rVIII-SingleChain were sufficient to achieve hemostasis. 
Table 11  
(Efficacy Population) 
Number of rVIII-SingleChain Injections Required to Achieve Hemostasis 
Efficacy: Routine Prophylaxis to Prevent or Reduce the Frequency of Bleeding Episodes 
The median observed AsBR and ABR was low in this study (0.00 and 1.14, respectively). The AsBR in 
subjects on the prophylaxis regimen was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than in subjects on the 
on-demand regimen. Similar results were observed for the ABR, and for the AsBR and ABR in subjects ≥ 
18 to ≤ 65 years. In subjects ≥ 12 to < 18 years, the AsBR and ABR could not be compared between 
regimens, as all subjects in this age group were using the prophylaxis regimen. 
The majority of subjects using a prophylaxis regimen were administered rVIII-SingleChain 2 or 3 times 
weekly at 20 to 50 IU/kg. The AsBR and ABR were similar between these 2 prophylaxis regimens. For any 
prophylaxis regimen, most subjects did not have a dose adjustment or only had 1 dose adjustment 
(87.7%).

per week. 
Efficacy: Perioperative Prophylaxis (Surgical Prophylaxis) 
There were 16 surgeries during the study, all of which were non-emergency surgeries. The treatment 
success rate of rVIII-SingleChain was 100%, based on the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of 
haemostatic efficacy. The mean volume of blood loss during the surgical substudy was lower than 
predicted levels, while the volume of transfused packed red blood cells was consistent with predicted 
levels. Hemoglobin levels were maintained close to baseline levels, with a slight reduction in the 
post-operative period. 
Doses of rVIII-SingleChain administered during the surgical substudy were in the range expected to 
achieve efficacy based on the WFH guidelines, both pre- and intra-operatively (pre-surgery 68.3 [22.16] 
IU/kg, intra-operative 37.0 [11.81] IU/kg) and during the 14 days of the post-surgical period (704.0 
[391.74] IU/kg)(mean [SD] values). rVIII-SingleChain consumption in surgery was within the 
expectations for the types of procedures performed. 
The volume (mean [SD]) of blood loss during the surgical substudy (73.3 [107.18] mL) was lower than 
predicted volume (259.3 [369.42] mL).

treatment during Parts 2 or 3 of the study. There were 
146 subjects in the rVIII-SingleChain Prophylaxis 
group.  
The rVIII-SingleChain On-demand group consisted of 
all subjects in the Efficacy population who received at 
least 1 dose rVIII-SingleChain as part of on-demand 
treatment during Parts 2 or 3 of the study. There were 
27 subjects in the rVIII-SingleChain On-demand group.

either routine prophylaxis treatment or on-demand 
treatment during Parts 2 or 3 of the study. There were 
173 subjects in the Efficacy population.  
The investigator rated the efficacy of the treatment 
based on a 4-point rating scale "excellent, good, 
moderate or poor/no response". Efficacy ratings of 
"excellent" or "good" were considered treatment 
success for this end point; the percentage of bleeding

Study 3002 (Subjects 0 to < 12 Years) 
Study 3002 was a multicenter, open-label, phase III study to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of 
rVIII-SingleChain in subjects 0 to < 12 years of age with severe haemophilia A. The study consisted of a 
PK evaluation period (single-dose PK of 50 IU/kg rVIII-SingleChain) and a treatment period (on-demand 
or prophylaxis regimen with rVIII-SingleChain).

Key Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects who met any of the following exclusion criteria were not eligible for enrolment into the study: 
•  Any history of, or current, FVIII inhibitors 
•  Any first order family (ie, siblings) history of FVIII inhibitors 
•  Administration of any cryoprecipitate, whole blood, or plasma within 30 days prior to 
administration of rVIII-SingleChain 
•  Known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction or anaphylaxis) to any FVIII product or hamster protein 
•  Any known congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital FVIII deficiency 
• 
Platelet count < 100,000/μL at Screening 
•  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive subjects with a CD4 count < 200/mm3 at 
Screening 
•  Subject currently receiving intravenous (IV) immunomodulating agents such as immunoglobulin 
or chronic systemic corticosteroid treatment 
•  Subject with serum aspartate aminotransferase or serum alanine aminotransferase values > 5 
times (x) the upper limit of normal at Screening 
•  Subjects with serum creatinine values > 2 x the upper limit of normal at Screening 
• 
Evidence of thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, 
myocardial infarction and arterial embolus within 3 months before Day 1 
•  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to rVIII-SingleChain or to any excipients of 
rVIII-SingleChain 
• 
Treatments 
In the treatment period, subjects were assigned to an on-demand or prophylaxis regimen with 
rVIII-SingleChain at the investigator’s discretion. In the event of a bleeding episode, subjects in both 
regimens were treated with a rVIII-SingleChain dose prescribed by the investigator. The desired FVIII 
level for the treatment of a bleeding episode was based on the recommendations of the WFH (WFH, 
2012). 
For the prophylaxis regimen, subjects were to receive rVIII-SingleChain at a dose of 15 to 50 IU/kg every 
second day or 2 to 3 times weekly, or at a dose and frequency determined by the investigator based on 
historical FVIII dosing and available PK data. Subjects were not allowed to switch from on-demand to 
prophylaxis regimen or vice versa, but dose adjustments were permitted at the discretion of the 
investigator. In addition to their on-demand or prophylaxis regimen, subjects could receive preventative 
doses (eg, doses given prior to an activity or minor procedure to prevent or reduce potential bleeding 
episodes) or additional doses (eg, doses taken beyond the need to control hemostasis). These doses 
contributed to an ED and consumption of FVIII, but did not contribute to the efficacy evaluation of the 
treatment of a bleeding episode. Subjects were to be treated for at least 50 EDs until there was a total of 
25 subjects 0 to < 6 years and 25 subjects  ≥ 6 to < 12 years achieving at least 50 EDs in the respective 
age group, thereafter, subjects could roll over into Extension study 3001.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in the treatment of 
major and minor bleeding episodes based on the investigator’s 4-point assessment scale. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was: 
•  Control and prevention of bleeding episodes: rate of treatment success for bleeding episodes 
defined as a rating of “excellent” or “good” on the investigator’s overall clinical assessment 
of haemostatic efficacy 4-point scale 
To estimate the rate of treatment success, the numerator included the number of bleeding episodes 
treated with rVIII-SingleChain and rated as “excellent” or “good”, and the denominator included all 
treated bleeding episodes. In the primary analysis, treated bleeding episodes with missing investigator 
ratings were counted as treatment failures. In the sensitivity analyses, bleeding episodes with missing 
investigator ratings were either excluded from the calculation, or counted as treatment success. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Control and prevention of bleeding episodes: number of injections of rVIII-SingleChain required 
to achieve hemostasis, and consumption of rVIII-SingleChain 
•  Routine prophylaxis: ABR during on-demand and during prophylaxis treatment, and consumption 
of rVIII-SingleChain 
Other secondary endpoints were:  
• 
PK parameters for rVIII-SingleChain 
The secondary safety endpoints: 
•  Occurrence of inhibitor formation to rVIII-SingleChain evaluated from the time of first 
rVIII-SingleChain dose through the End-of-study visit 
•  Safety measures including AEs, SAEs, local tolerability, laboratory safety parameters, 
measurement of non-inhibitory ADAs and antibodies against CHO host cell proteins, physical 
examination, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate) 
• 
Sample size 
The determination of sample size was based on the EMA guideline for recombinant and human 
plasma-derived Factor VIII products in children < 12 years of age [EMA, 2011]. This guideline requires a 
minimum of 25 subjects ≥ 6 years of age to < 12 years of age and 25 subjects 0 to < 6 years of age 
suffering from severe haemophilia A. A total of approximately 75 subjects were planned to be enrolled in 
this study to ensure that at least 25 subjects in each age group receive 50 EDs of rVIII-SingleChain. 
No formal statistical comparisons were planned in this study. Rather, the primary aim of analyses was to 
provide descriptive summaries, and in some cases point and interval estimates, of key variables or 
parameters.

Recruitment 
A total of 88 subjects were screened for this study at 37 study sites in 19 countries. Eighty-four of the 
screened subjects were eligible and enrolled into the study (35 subjects 0 to < 6 years; 49 subjects ≥ 6 to 
< 12 years), and all 84 subjects were exposed to treatment with rVIII-SingleChain. Eighty-one subjects 
were assigned to a prophylaxis regimen, the remaining 3 subjects were assigned to on-demand regimen 
(all in the ≥ 6 to < 12 years age group). 
Overall, 65 subjects completed the study, 19 subjects were discontinued from the study (1 subject due to 
an AE, 1 subject based on physician decision, and 17 subjects due to study termination by the sponsor 
[Note: “study termination by the sponsor” signifies the planned closure of the study in an age group once 
the required number of 25 subjects with 50 EDs had been reached in that age group. Subjects still on 
study at this time were rolled over into Extension Study 3001, irrespective of their number of EDs). One

subject was discontinued by the physician due to a series of complex social circumstances; this case was 
reviewed by the IDMC.  
There was no difference in the frequency or reasons of discontinuation between the Safety and Efficacy 
Populations, between the 2 age groups, or between the on-demand and prophylaxis regimens.

Conduct of the study 
Four protocol amendments (2 global substantial amendments, 1 non-substantial amendment 
[administrative change] and 1 country specific amendment for France) were issued after finalization of 
Version 1.0 of the study protocol on 05 October 2012.  No subjects were enrolled under Version 1.0 of the 
study protocol and that enrollment started under Protocol Amendment 1. 
The main changes to the study conduct as a result of the global substantial protocol amendments were as 
follows: 
Protocol Amendment 1 was issued on 21 May 2013: 
Extend the duration of subject study participation to allow at least 50 EDs; Increase cohort size of 
subjects screened for participation; Distinguish lab assessments performed by local or central 
laboratories; Reiterate the recording of actual dosing rather than nominal dosing; Add assessment for 
CHO antibodies; Update the definitions of overdose, treatment compliance, retention of samples, and 
haemophilia social history and activity level; Clarify End-of-study procedures; Define preventative dosing 
and additional dosing; Collect additional subject information including blood group and gene defect of 
haemophilia A; Clarify serum chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters to be collected; Clarify 
statistical analyses and methods;Update IDMC responsibilities 
Protocol Amendment 2 was issued on 28 March 2014: 
Incorporate the non-substantial amendment change for subjects not returning unused medication at 
every visit; Incorporate a change in the PK collection time points as recommended by FDA; Update IDMC 
data review information 
The following changes were made to the statistical analyses between the SAP and the analyses 
performed: 
• 
The Efficacy Population had been defined as all subjects (in the Safety Population) who received 
at least 1 dose of Afstyla as part of either routine prophylaxis or on-demand regimen. The Efficacy 
Population excluded 1 subject who had a positive test for FVIII inhibitors at screening.

• 
Prophylaxis IU and total IU per subject per month and per year were not calculated, as the body 
weight-adjusted data (IU/kg) were considered to provide sufficient, and more meaningful, 
information about monthly and annual exposure. 
The number of spontaneous bleeding episodes in last 12 months, number of trauma-induced 
bleeding episodes in last 12 months, and number of bleeding episodes of unknown causality in 
last 12 months were only listed by subject, not summarized. 
Prophylaxis compliance was not summarized as a continuous variable, but only as a categorical 
variable. 
•  Annualized bleed rate was additionally summarized for the following subgroups: 
−  Subjects whose initial dose assignment was 15 to 50 IU/kg 
−  Subjects whose initial dose assignment was a once-weekly prophylaxis regimen 
−  Subjects with a positive test for non-inhibitory ADAs anytime during the study 
−  Subjects with zero dose adjustments; subjects with at least one dose adjustment 
−  Subgroups based on reason for at least one dose adjustment: physician decision, lack of 
efficacy, or other reasons 
−  Subjects with zero dose adjustments and ≥ 2 spontaneous bleeding episodes within a 
14-day period ; subjects with zero dose adjustments who did not have≥ 2 spontaneous 
bleeding episodes within a 14-day period 
−  Subgroups based on previous treatment modality: on-demand or prophylaxis 
• 
• 
• 
The number of bleeding episodes over time was summarized for the time intervals of Day 1 to 90, 
Day 91 to 180, Day 181 to 270, and Day 271 to 360, instead of Day 1 to 90, Day 91 to 120, Day 
121 to 150, etc. Day 631 to 720, Day > 720. Also, the number of bleeding episodes over time was 
only summarized for the Efficacy Population by modality (not overall and not by age group) 
The listing for time between the last injection and the next bleeding episode did not include the 
information on treatment modality 
There were no subgroup analyses for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, Japan, and Black subjects as there were no 
subjects in these subgroups. 
•  Clinically significant vital signs were reported based on criteria predefined in the SAP instead of 
based on investigator’s assessment of clinical significance, because investigator’s assessment of 
clinical significance was not collected. 
• 
Baseline data 
The subject population was all male and predominantly White (73.5% in the Efficacy Population). 
Subjects had a mean age of 6.6 years (minimum, maximum: 1, 11 years). Differences between subjects 
0 to < 6 years and subjects ≥ 6 to < 12 years were consistent with the ontogeny of the subject population. 
Subjects had a mean weight of 27.6 kg. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the Efficacy, Safety, and PK Populations were generally 
consistent, except for a higher proportion of White subjects in the PK Population compared to the Efficacy 
and Safety Populations.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 84 subjects (35 subjects 0 to < 6 years, and 49 subjects ≥ 6 to < 12 years) were treated with 
rVIII-SingleChain and comprised the Safety Population. The Efficacy Population comprised 83 subjects 
(80 subjects assigned to a prophylaxis regimen, and 3 subjects assigned to an on-demand regimen). The 
PK Population comprised 39 subjects (20 subjects 0 to < 6 years, 19 subjects ≥ 6 to < 12 years).  
There were no deaths. Two subjects were withdrawn from the study (1 subject due to an unrelated 
non-serious TEAE of hip arthralgia, 1 subject based on physician decision).

• 
Outcomes and estimation 
Overall, 80 of the 83 subjects in the Efficacy Population were assigned to a prophylaxis regimen with 
rVIII-SingleChain. The remaining 3 subjects were assigned to an on-demand regimen with 
rVIII-SingleChain. These 3 subjects were in the ≥ 6 to < 12 year group and had also been on an 
on-demand regimen before the study. 21 of the 80 subjects assigned to a prophylaxis regimen in this 
study had been on an on-demand regimen before the study. 
The most frequent prophylaxis regimens in both age groups were the 2-times-weekly (43 subjects) and 
3-times-weekly (24 subjects) regimens at the initial assignment. At the end of the study, 38 subjects 
were assigned to a 2-times-weekly regimen and 32 subjects to a 3-times-weekly regimen.  
Across all prophylaxis regimens, 74 of the 80 subjects were assigned to an initial dose between 15 and 50 
IU/kg, with only 1 subject assigned a dose less than 20 IU/kg. The remaining prophylaxis subjects 
assigned to an initial dose outside of the 15 to 50 IU/kg range used rVIII-SingleChain doses no higher 
than 57 IU/kg. No subjects used doses < 15 IU/kg.

Table 20:  
Summary of Dose Assignment and Dose Adjustments (Efficacy Population, 
study 3002) 
51 of the 83 subjects (61.4%) in the Efficacy Population required no adjustment of the rVIII SingleChain 
dose or regimen. A small number of subjects shifted from the 2-times-weekly (N = 6), every second day 
(N = 1) or once-weekly (N = 1) regimens to a 3-times-weekly regimen.  
However, the percentage of prophylaxis subjects requiring ≥ 1 dose adjustment was similar between the 
2-times-weekly regimen (39.5%) and the 3-times-weekly regimen (41.7%). The main reason for dose 
adjustments was “physician decision” in all treatment regimens. 
A higher proportion of subjects in the ≥ 6 to < 12 year group had at least 1 dose adjustment (21 of 48 
subjects [43.8%]) than in the 0 to < 6 year group (11 of 35 subjects [31.4%]), and 5 of the 6 subjects 
with more than 2 dose adjustments were in the ≥ 6 to < 12 year age group. 
Overall, 92.5% of prophylaxis subjects were compliant with their prophylaxis regimen, and 90.4% of 
subjects were compliant with their treatment dose. 
Efficacy: Control and Prevention of Bleeding Episodes 
The characteristics of the bleeding episodes treated in the study are summarized by treatment regimen 
and additionally by age group in Table 21. 
The primary endpoint for assessment of rVIII-SingleChain for treatment of bleeding episodes was 
treatment success, defined as a rating of “excellent” or “good” on the investigator’s overall clinical 
assessment of haemostatic efficacy 4-point scale.

Table 21:  
Treatment Success - Overall Investigator’s Assessment of Haemostatic Efficacy 
(Efficacy Population, study 3002) 
The investigator assessment of haemostatic efficacy was “excellent” for 296 treated bleeding episodes, 
“good” for 38 bleeding episodes, “moderate” for 12 bleeding episodes, and “poor/no response” for 1 
bleeding episode. Thus, the rate of treatment success was 96.3% (ie, 334 of 347 episodes), with a 95% 
CI of 91.3% to 98.4%. 
The rate of treatment success was similar between the 2 age groups (0 to < 6 years: 94.0%; ≥ 6 to < 12 
years: 96.6%). 
The secondary endpoint for assessment of treatment of bleeding episodes was the number of injections of 
rVIII-SingleChain required to achieve hemostasis (1, 2, 3, or > 3 injections).

Table 22:  
Number of rVIII-SingleChain Injections Required to Achieve Hemostasis 
(Efficacy Population, study 3002) 
Overall, 1 or 2 injections of rVIII-SingleChain were sufficient to achieve hemostasis in 332 of the 347 
treated bleeding episodes (95.7%). The overall median dose was 27.6 IU/kg per bleeding episode and 
27.3 IU/kg per injection per bleeding episode. Seven bleeding episodes (2.0%) in 4 subjects required > 
3 rVIII-SingleChain injections to achieve hemostasis. 
The proportion of bleeding episodes controlled with 1 or 2 rVIII-SingleChain injection was similar between 
the 2 age groups (0 to < 6 years: 94.0%; ≥ 6 to < 12 years: 96.0% of treated bleeding episodes). 
For 17 bleeding episodes in 12 of the 83 subjects in the Efficacy Population (all in the prophylaxis group), 
a total of 50 additional rVIII-SingleChain doses were administered (ie, doses beyond the need to control 
hemostasis to prevent rebleeding and promote hematoma resorption), with a median of 2 additional 
doses per bleeding episode. Additional doses for bleeding episodes were more frequently administered in 
subjects ≥ 6 to < 12 years (9 subjects with a total of 14 bleeding episodes and a total of 45 additional 
doses) than in subjects 0 to < 6 years (3 subjects with a total of 3 bleeding episodes and a total of 5 
additional doses. 
Efficacy: Routine Prophylaxis to Prevent or Reduce the Frequency of Bleeding Episodes 
In the 80 subjects on prophylaxis, the median observed ABR was 3.69 bleeding episodes per year for total 
bleeding episodes, and 0.00 for spontaneous bleeding episodes.

Table 22:  
Annualized Bleeding Rate by rVIII-SingleChain Regimen (Efficacy Population, 
study 3002) 
Twenty-one of the 80 subjects (26.3%) had no bleeding episodes requiring treatment with 
rVIII-SingleChain. 
As expected, the observed ABRs across all bleeding types were substantially higher in the 3 subjects on 
the on-demand regimen (35.1, 78.6 and 86.6 total bleeding episodes per year). 
In the subjects receiving prophylaxis, the median observed ABR for total and joint bleeding episodes was 
higher in the ≥ 6 to < 12 year age group than in the 0 to < 6 year age group (total bleeding episodes: 5.11 
(Q1,Q3: 2.52, 10.50) vs. 2.12 (Q1,Q3: 0.00, 4.54), respectively; joint bleeding episodes: 2.31 vs. 0.00, 
respectively) Consistent with this, the percentage of subjects with no treated bleeding episode was lower 
in subjects ≥ 6 to < 12 years (15.6%) than in subjects 0 to < 6 years of age (40.0%). The median AsBR 
was 0.00 (Q1,Q3: 0.00, 1.46)  in subjects 0 to < 6 years of age and 0.00 (Q1,Q3: 0.00, 3.20) in subjects 
≥ 6 to < 12 years. 
A summary of the ABR by prophylaxis regimen for the 74 subjects with an initial dose assignment in the 
range of 15 to 50 IU/kg is presented in the following Table.

receiving prophylaxis every second day or at other regimens was too small for conclusive comparisons. 
The percentage of subjects with no treated bleeding episodes was higher with the 3-times-weekly

Table 25:  
Consumption of rVIII-SingleChain during Routine Prophylaxis (Efficacy 
Population, study 3002) 
Across all prophylaxis regimens, the median prophylaxis dose per subject was 342 IU/kg per month and 
4109 IU/kg per year. Despite the protocol allowing for higher doses up to 50 IU/kg in less frequent dosing 
regimens, doses prescribed per injection were not higher with the 2-times-weekly than with the 
3-times-weekly regimen, resulting in a 30% overall lower consumption on the 2-times-weekly regimen. 
Since subjects on prophylaxis had a low number of bleeding episodes and administered only few 
preventative / additional doses, the total consumption of rVIII-SingleChain (ie, prophylaxis doses plus 
doses to treat bleeding episodes and preventative / additional doses) was not substantially higher than 
the consumption for prophylaxis alone. 
Overall, there were no relevant differences between the age groups in consumption of rVIII-SingleChain.

Summary of main efficacy results 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from study 3002 supporting the present application. 
This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit

Title: A Phase III Open-label Pharmacokinetic, Efficacy and Safety Study of rVIII-SingleChain in a 
Pediatric Population with Severe Haemophilia A 
Study 
identifier 
CSL627_ 3002 
This is an international, multicenter, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and 
PK profile of rVIII-SingleChain in pediatric patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII 
concentration <1%). Subjects received either on-demand or prophylaxis treatment with 
rVIII-SingleChain at a dose to be determined by the investigator. Haemostatic efficacy 
was assessed by the subject/caregiver and the investigator who assessed overall efficacy 
by a 4-point scale.

Hypothesis 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in the 
treatment of major and minor bleeding events based on the investigator’s 4-point 
assessment scale in a pediatric population.

On-Demand 
Subjects receiving routine prophylaxis treatment were initially 
treated with 15-50 IU/kg of rVIII-SingleChain every 2nd day or 2 
to 3 times per week, or at the investigator’s discretion, based 
upon available PK data, the FVIII treatment regimen used before 
enrollment and/or the subject’s bleeding phenotype. The dose or 
dosing frequency may have been adjusted if necessary. 
Preventative and additional doses of rVIII-SingleChain were 
allowed; data from such doses are included in the analysis of 
'Consumption of rVIII-SingleChain' end points. "Preventative 
dose" was a dose taken before an activity or a minor procedure to 
prevent or minimize a bleeding episode and "additional dose" was 
a dose taken beyond the need to control hemostasis.  
 Subjects assigned to the on-demand treatment regimen treated 
themselves, or were treated by a caregiver/guardian, as needed 
for any bleeding episode and did not receive routine assigned 
infusions. Preventative and additional doses of rVIII-SingleChain 
were allowed; data from such doses are included in the analysis of 
'Consumption of rVIII-SingleChain' end points. "Preventative 
dose" was defined as a dose taken before an activity or a minor 
procedure to prevent or minimize a bleeding episode, and 
"additional dose" was defined as a dose taken beyond the need to 
control hemostasis.

Efficacy Population 
The Efficacy Population consisted of all subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of rVIII-SingleChain as part of either a routine 
prophylaxis or on-demand regimen during the study. One subject 
was excluded from the efficacy population because of a 
pre-existing inhibitor to FVIII (confirmed by reexamination of a 
screening sample initially reported as negative due to laboratory 
error).

2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy of rFVIII-SingleChain was mainly evaluated in two Phase 3 studies: Study 1001 in adults and 
adolescents ≥12 years of age and Study 3002 in children <12 years of age, which both are completed. 
Moreover, a currently ongoing extension study (3001) is being conducted, where around 60% of the 
subjects from the Phase 3 studies had been enrolled by the data cut-off date 29 May 2015. 
Overall, conduct of the clinical investigation of rFVIII-SingleChain follows the EMA Guideline on the clinical 
investigation of factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009): A sufficient number of previously 
treated patients with severe haemophilia A out of the relevant age groups were followed for at least 50 
EDs, with also a sufficient number of subjects ≥12 years who were followed for at least 6 months for 
assessment of rFVIII-SingleChain efficacy in prophylaxis. Very limited information about the efficacy and 
safety are available from patients > 60 years. The requested number of rFVIII-SingleChain response 
assessments during (major) surgical procedures was satisfied. All subjects in the rVIII-SingleChain 
studies had a confirmed FVIII level of <1% documented in the source data (inclusion criteria) and with 
that, a confirmed diagnosis of severe haemophilia A. Therefore efficacy results in relation to dose 
consumption are not biased by the baseline level of FVIII. 
Endpoints chosen are regarded appropriate for efficacy assessment of rFVIII-SingleChain treatment and 
also in line with the current FVIII Guidance. 
The assessment of bleeding episodes such as spontaneous or traumatic was always documented in the 
database. Spontaneous annualized bleeding rate has been introduced as an efficacy parameter. Such rate 
might serve as a parameter for efficacy of prophylaxis as it is “countable” and represents an 
easy-to-understand number. However, lack of definitions for a “bleed”, for “spontaneous” or “traumatic” 
nature of such bleed and individual evaluation factors are considered to be highly challenging when 
comparing numbers. Furthermore, comparison of ABR while on on-demand versus on 
prophylaxis-regimen is considered to be of highly restricted value: On-demand therapy mainly represents 
severity of haemophilia (overall bleeding frequency) and not efficacy of a certain product. On the other 
hand, total ABR while on prophylaxis ideally should aim at zero bleeds and should be amended by 
documentation of exceptional challenges during the evaluation period. 
rFVIII-SingleChain efficacy was investigated in treatment and prevention of bleeds, routine prophylaxis 
and perioperative management by assessment of treatment response rating, rFVIII-SingleChain 
consumption and determination of (annualised) bleeding rates. The treatment of bleedings in the 
on-demand setting is regarded as a different situation e.g. localization, severity and frequency of the 
bleed. Therefore, in this non-randomized study, subjects were able to choose whether to receive 
on-demand or prophylaxis treatment. It is accepted because randomization of a subject from their 
current prophylactic regimen to on-demand treatment would be considered unethical. Presentation of 
results of response rating was done for all kinds of bleeding episodes. As requested, the response 
assessment stratified by severity of the bleeding episodes has been provided by the applicant. Median 
dose per injection (IU/kg/injection) and median total dose (IU/kg/bleed) in minor and moderate bleeds 
are comparable between groups. However, in major bleeds both median dose per injection (48.9 vs. 
31.6) and median total dose (50.5 vs. 31.8) were higher in study 3002. This discrepancy seems to 
attribute to the fact that in children those bleeds stratified into the major category were treated with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 80/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher dose. Overall treatment success varied from 88.9% (Study 3002, major bleeds) to 100% (Study 
1001, minor bleeds). 
The statistical methods applied are considered appropriate in general. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study1001 
The efficacy population of Study 1001 comprised 173 subjects ≥12 to ≤65 years (27 subjects on an 
on-demand regimen, 146 subjects on a prophylaxis regimen) exposed to rVIII-SingleChain for 14,306 
EDs and treating 848 bleeding episodes overall.   
Demographic and baseline characteristics of study subjects reflect the typical population of patients with 
haemophilia A. The Applicant has chosen to exclude subjects older than 65 years. Thus, efficacy data in 
this subpopulation is missing completely. Therefore, the SmPC does list data in this subpopulation as 
missing.. 
In Study 1001, adult and adolescent subjects receiving prophylaxis (N=146) had a median ABR of 1.14 
(Q1,Q3: 0.0, 4.2) bleeding episodes/year and a median AsBR of 0.00 (Q1,Q3: 0.0, 2.4) bleeding 
episodes/year. Both values were significantly lower than the median ABR and AsBR in subjects receiving 
on-demand treatment (N=27); 19.64 (Q1,Q3: 6.2, 46.5)and 11.73 (Q1,Q3: 2.8, 36.5) bleeding 
episodes/year, respectively. Based on a Poisson model, this represents a reduction in mean ABR and 
AsBR by ≥ 90% with prophylaxis compared to on-demand. 
The majority of spontaneous bleeding episodes that required treatment were located in the joint, followed 
by the muscle and other locations, which is consistent with the nature of the disease (severe 
haemophilia). 
In general, the annualised bleeding rates are regarded to be in an acceptable range. It is recognized that 
one subject who achieved a prophylactic treatment regimen had 40 spontaneous bleeding episodes per 
year. The Applicant has thoroughly discussed all cases of subjects who achieved a prophylactic treatment 
regimen with more than 5 bleeding episodes. Common contributing factors, significant joint inflammation 
or a more severe bleeding phenotype explain the observed higher number of bleeds. 
In Study 1001, there were no differences in ABR and AsBR between the 2-times weekly and 
3-times-weekly regimens, neither in the initial nor the final dose assignment analysis. The median ABR 
and AsBR were both 0.00 in the 46 subjects on a 2-times-weekly prophylaxis regimen with a dose of 20 
to 50 IU/kg and 1.53 and 0.00 in the 77 subjects on a 3-times-weekly regimen with a dose of 20 to 50 
IU/kg. 
In adults/adolescents in Study 1001 on a 3-times-weekly prophylaxis regimen, the median starting dose 
was 30 IU/kg per injection; subjects dosed 2 times weekly had a median starting dose of 35 IU/kg per 
injection. rVIII-SingleChain consumption across all regimens was 4,283 IU/kg/year (median) and 4494 
IU/kg/year (mean). Presentation of consumption of FVIII follows the Clinical Guideline. The presented 
consumption-data support efficacy of rFVIII-SingleChain, overall. 
A dose of 20 to 50 IU/kg administered 2 to 3 times weekly is proposed for prophylaxis. The Applicant was 
asked to provide individual patient data listings of injections reflecting dose/kg and date of application for 
each patient as well as stratification in age groups. The additional data, as presented by the applicant, 
were regarded sufficient to support the dose recommendations in the adolescent and adult population. 
As requested the Applicant provided the overall prophylaxis consumption as “total dose administered per 
subject per month (IU/kg)” including preventative doses (Prevention Prior to Activity) as well as doses for 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 81/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘Bleeding Event’, ‘Surgery’, ‘Post Surgery’, and ‘Additional Treatment’. Additional details why the 
preventative dose was administered were not documented; therefore an individual summary of reasons 
for administration is not available. Instead, the applicant presented a compliance calculation. This was 
accepted.  
In subjects ≥12 to ≤65 years in Study 1001, treatment success (ie, an investigator haemostatic efficacy 
rating of “excellent” or “good”) was documented in 92.3% of all treated bleeding episodes assessed 
in the on-demand and prophylaxis regimens combined. 
The Applicant provided information regarding number of infusions for treatment of a bleeding episode. In 
Study 1001 in adults/adolescents, 80.9% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 injection, 12.6% 
with 2 injections, and 3.4% with 3 injections of rVIII-SingleChain which is regarded as a good and 
sufficient response. In summary, breakthrough bleeding episodes on prophylaxis were controlled with 1 
or 2 injections of rVIII-SingleChain in 90.7% of events in adult/adolescent subjects. 
Overall, the success rates of the treatment of bleeds using rVIII-SingleChain are in an acceptable range. 
In no patients the haemostatic response was rated as poor. More bleeding episodes per subject were 
reported in the on-demand regimen than in the prophylaxis regimen, in line with expectations for the 
treatment modalities. 
There are 16 surgeries among the 13 subjects in the Surgical Population. A sufficient number of major 
surgeries were evaluated for rFVIII-SingleChain efficacy. The provided data sufficiently show haemostatic 
effect of rVIII-SingleChain during surgery and fulfil the requirements of the guideline. However, no 
pediatric subjects <18 years of age were included in the surgery population. It is considered appropriate 
to mention this in the SmPC. 
Study 3002 
The efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in treatment of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis was assessed 
in 83 subjects < 12 years of age with haemophilia A. 
It should be noted that only 3 subjects were assigned to an on-demand regimen, and that no formal 
comparisons of ABR between on-demand and prophylaxis regimens were performed. 
There were a total of 389 bleeding episodes in the 83 subjects in the Efficacy Population. Of these, 347 
episodes in 62 subjects required treatment with rVIII-SingleChain. The number of treated bleeding 
episodes per subject was higher in the on-demand regimen (total of 132 episodes in 3 subjects) than in 
the prophylaxis regimen (total of 215 episodes in 59 subjects), as expected with the assigned treatment 
modality. 
Overall, the most frequent location of bleeding episodes was the joint (61.7%), followed by other 
locations (23.1%), and the muscle (14.4%). 
Subjects in the age group ≥6 to <12 years had more total bleeding episodes (especially a higher 
proportion of traumatic bleeding episodes). This is considered to a higher level physical activity in the 
older age group. 
Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy in 347 bleeds was “excellent” or “good” in the majority 
(96.3%) of bleeding episodes which is considered be acceptable. One patient is found for response rated 
as “poor/none response” and further 12 patients are documented with “moderate response”. The 
applicant was asked to comment. From this further analysis no clinically relevant impact on the final 
efficacy conclusion from Studies 3002 was identified. For 42 bleeds no FVIII-substitution was required, at 
all. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 82/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment success was documented in 96.3% of all treated bleeding episodes in the on-demand and 
prophylaxis regimens combined. 85.9% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 injection, 9.8% with 
2 injections, and 2.3% with 3 injections of rVIII-SingleChain. 
The median ABR was higher with the 2-times-weekly regimen than with the 3-times-weekly regimen 
(medians of 4.37 (Q1,Q3: 2.31, 7.24) and 2.30 (Q1,Q3: 0.00, 2.08), respectively) as well as in the older 
age group than in the younger age group (medians of 5.11 and 2.12, respectively). The higher ABR in the 
2-times-weekly regimen might reflect the higher CL and shorter t1/2 of rVIII-SingleChain in children, but 
could also be the result of an almost 30% lower weekly consumption in subjects assigned to a 
2-times-weekly regimen. The higher ABR in the older age group might reflect a more active population. 
These findings suggest that higher rVIII-SingleChain doses might be considered for children on a 
2-times-weekly prophylaxis regimen, and more frequent injections might be required in active children. 
The median observed AsBR for spontaneous bleeding episodes was 0.00 (Q1,Q3: 0.00, 3.03) for the 
3-times-weekly regimen and 0.00 (Q1,Q3: 0.00, 2.08) for the 2-times-weekly regimens. 
According to PK simulations in the group < 6 years old receiving a dose regimen 30 IU/kg twice weekly 
(either day 0 and 3.5 or day 0 and 4) only 54.7% and 46.2% remained at a trough level > 1% whereas 
in the group >12 years old 73.7% and 64.2 % remained. If only these PK simulations are taken into 
account, this percentage is considered to be too low to support the twice weekly 30 IU/kg regimen in the 
paediatric population. 
It was requested that the Applicant provide the ABR and AsBR for subjects on 2- and 3-times- weekly 
regimens stratified by age group and stratified in dose range. In the age groups 0 to < 6 years and 6 to 
<12 years the ABR and AsBR was higher in the <30 IU/kg range. Therefore, the Applicant recommends 
a starting dose for children < 12 years of age on prophylaxis of 30 to 50 IU/kg 2 or 3 times weekly taking 
also into account the presented PK simulations. In principle this dose modification was endorsed, but the 
dose regimen 30 IU/kg 2 times weekly was still considered questionable especially in the younger children 
population. However, after further detailed analysis of stratified data, it is agreed that in children dosage 
regimens above 30 IU/kg are sufficient to achieve ABR and AsBRs comparable with other recombinant 
FVIII products. Thus, the SmPC recommendation of starting dose for children of 30 to 50 IU/kg 2 or 3 time 
weekly is considered acceptable. 
Across all prophylaxis regimens, the median prophylaxis dose per subject was 342 IU/kg per month and 
4109 IU/kg per year. The overall annual consumption across all regimens was very similar to the values 
in Study 1001 (rVIII-SingleChain consumption: 4,283 IU/kg/year [median] and 4,494 IU/kg/year 
[mean]). 
The respective values in adults and children are reflected in the SmPC, as reference for efficacy in 
prophylaxis. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy has been analysed for prophylaxis, on-demand treatment, treatment of breakthrough bleeding 
episodes and prophylaxis for surgical procedures. Study designs, selection and number of patients, 
assessment tools and results are in general adequate for supporting efficacy of the rVIII-SingleChain.  
In summary, rVIII-SingleChain is an effective FVIII replacement therapy which is considered to be 
suitable for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, for use as routine prophylaxis with treatment 
intervals of 2 to 3 times weekly, and for perioperative prophylaxis in adult and adolescent patients and 
children with haemophilia A.

Patient exposure 
Table 27 
Exposure to rVIII-SingleChain in Clinical Studies (Safety Populations, Study 1001 and 
Study 3002, and Enrolled Population, Study 3001)  
The overall safety population comprises a total of 258 unique individuals (174 from Study 1001 and 84 
from Study 3002) who received at least 1 dose of rVIII-SingleChain, with a total of 19,545 EDs. 
In Study 1001, 120 of the 174 adolescent/adult subjects achieved ≥ 50 EDs, and 52 subjects ≥ 100 EDs. 
In Study 3002, 65 of the 84 pediatric subjects achieved ≥ 50 EDs (thereof 27 subjects 0 to < 6 years and 
38 subjects ≥6 to < 12 years), and 8 subjects ≥ 100 EDs.  
Assessment report

In Extension Study 3001, an additional 8,873 EDs have been documented in the 154 subjects as of the 
cutoff date for this submission (132 adults and adolescents from Study 1001 and 32 children from Study 
3002). Combined with the exposure achieved in the pivotal studies, total exposure is 28,418 EDs in the 
clinical program, with 109 subjects achieving ≥ 100 EDs. 
Adverse events 
In Study 1001, 113 subjects experienced a total of 292 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in a total of 
14,592 injections and 14,306 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain. The 3 most common TEAEs were 
nasopharyngitis, arthralgia and headache. Of the 10 TESAEs reported in this study, 1 was assessed as 
related by the investigator; this was an event of hypersensitivity that could be controlled by 
administration of steroids and antihistamines allowing hospital discharge on the day of the event, and the 
subject remained on rVIII-SingleChain treatment and tolerated it well. No subject withdrew from the 
study due to a TEAE.

In Study 3002, 64 subjects experienced a total of 183 TEAEs in a total of 5,313 injections and 5,239 EDs 
with rVIII-SingleChain. The most common TEAEs in subjects 0 to < 12 years were nasopharyngitis, 
arthralgia, cough, and headache. One TEAE (drug hypersensitivity) was assessed as related to 
rVIII-SingleChain. Of the 11 TESAEs, none were assessed as related by the investigator. One subject 
withdrew from the study due to a non-related TEAE of hip arthralgia. 
In Study 3001, 91 AEs in 48 subjects have been reported, with 1 of them (drug hypersensitivity, 
non-serious) assessed as related to rVIII-SingleChain by the Sponsor. The most common AE in this study 
was nasopharyngitis. Of the 6 SAEs, none was assessed as related by the investigator. Two subjects 
withdrew from the study due to AEs .  
The PTs were categorized as undesirable effects after careful review [by the Sponsor] of all TEAEs. Those 
include TEAEs occurring in ≥ 2 subjects, TEAEs considered by the investigator as related to 
rVIII-SingleChain, and TESAEs from Studies 1001, 3002, and 3001 (up to 29 May 2015). In addition, in 
Study 1001, 4 subjects turned positive for non-inhibitory ADAs, but only 2 of these subjects remained 
positive at the End-of-study visit. In Study 3002, 10 subjects turned positive for non-inhibitory ADAs; 7 
of these subjects remained positive at the End-of-study visit. 
The SOC with the highest incidence of AEs was Infections and infestations (38 [45.2%] subjects). The 
most commonly reported AEs (> 5% of subjects) were nasopharyngitis (14 [16.7%] subjects, 15 events), 
arthralgia (8 [9.5%] subjects, 8 events), cough (7 [8.3%] subjects, 10 events), headache (7 [8.3%] 
subjects,  9  events),  head  injury  (5  [6.0%]  subjects;  6  events),  and  pyrexia  (5  [6.0%]  subjects;  5 
events).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in Studies 1001, 3002, or 3001. 
In Study 1001, 7 (4.0%) subjects experienced 9 TESAEs, of which 5 were severe, including 1 
(hypersensitivity) that was severe and considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. All 
subjects fully recovered. 
In Study 3002, 9 (10.7%) subjects had 11 TESAEs, none of which were considered related to 
rVIII-SingleChain, and all subjects fully recovered. 
In study 3001, 5 (3.2%) subjects had 6 SAEs none of which were considered by the investigator as related 
to the study drug. All SAEs were reported as resolved as of 29 May 2015. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology and clinical chemistry data are only presented for the completed Studies 1001 and 3002; the 
results for ongoing Study 3001 will be provided in the final CSR for Study 3001. 
Hematology 
In Studies 1001 and 3002, the mean changes across all hematology parameters were small from baseline 
to the End-of-study visit and from baseline to the lowest or highest value after baseline. For any given 
parameter, there were never more than 2 (1.1%) subjects in Study 1001 and 2 (2.4%) subjects in Study 
3002 who reported a clinically significant abnormal result at any visit (References have been provided). 
In Study 1001, 3 subjects had TEAEs of anemia, none of which were considered related to 
rVIII-SingleChain by the investigator. For 2 of these subjects, the anemia was non-serious and mild, and 
was reported as not resolved: for 1 of these subjects, anemia was already present in the subject’s medical 
history and the other subject was treated with iron. For the third subject, the anemia was serious and 
severe, and led to hospitalization but was reported as resolved.  
In Study 3002, 6 subjects had TEAEs of anemia, none of which were considered related to 
rVIII-SingleChain by the investigator. In 5 of the 6 subjects, the anemia TEAEs were non-serious and mild 
or moderate in intensity. Two of these events were iron deficiency anemia, and 3 events were treated with 
iron. Except for 2 events (1 resolving and 1 not resolved), all anemia TEAEs were reported as resolved at 
the last available assessment. In the remaining subject, 3 separate TESAEs of anemia were reported. 
Respective references and narratives have been provided. 
Clinical Chemistry 
In Studies 1001 and 3002, the mean changes across all biochemistry parameters were small from 
baseline to the End-of-study visit and from baseline to the lowest or highest value after baseline. 
In Study 1001, for any given parameter, there were never more than 2 (1.1%) subjects who reported a 
clinically significant abnormal result. A total of 9 (5.2%) subjects experienced 13 TEAEs in the SOC of 
Investigations. This included 1 subject with the TEAE of drug-specific antibody present; this event was 
reported as a TEAE by mistake, as antibody findings were not meant to be reported as AEs. In the other 
8 subjects, other than liver function test abnormal (2 [1.1%] subjects, 1 event each), none of the 
investigation PTs were experienced by more than 1 subject. None of these were assessed as related 
TEAEs by the investigator. 
In Study 3002, no subjects reported treatment-emergent abnormal values assessed as clinically 
significant by the investigator. No consistent trends or patterns regarding changes / abnormal values in 
renal or hepatic parameters were identified. Cases of marginally elevated liver enzyme or elevated

bilirubin levels primarily occurred in subjects with already elevated levels at Screening / Day 1 or were 
isolated cases that did not reoccur. Respective references have been provided. 
Viral safety 
The viral safety of rVIII-SingleChain final product is assured by the combination of virus testing of the 
expression system, the use of animal component-free media in the purification and formulation process, 
and the incorporation of dedicated virus removal / inactivation steps. The outcome of this comprehensive 
strategy is a final product that has a high level of virus safety. 
Viral safety retention samples were to be analyzed only if there is a suspicion of a viral infection. None of 
the subjects who participated in Study 1001, Study 3002, or Study 3001 had an event that warranted 
testing of the stored study blood samples for the presence of viral markers; the results for ongoing Study 
3001 will be provided in the final CSR. Respective references have been provided. 
Vital Signs and Physical Findings 
Vital signs and physical findings data are only presented for the completed Studies 1001 and 3002; the 
results for ongoing Study 3001 will be provided in the final CSR.  
No relevant changes in vital signs were observed in Study 1001 (including the Part 3 PK comparison of 
high and low strength formulations) or Study 3002. Potentially clinically significant changes in vital sign 
values at the end of Study 1001 were reported for 2 (1.1%) subjects, 1 with high and 1 with low diastolic 
blood pressure. In Study 3002, most of the potentially clinically significant values were isolated cases, 
and there was no indication of a clustering of potentially significant vital signs values in a particular age 
group or treatment modality. References have been provided. 
Safety in special populations 
No subject >65 years of age has been investigated in any of the clinical trials. 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar in subjects ≥ 12 to < 18 years (10 [71.4%] subjects) and ≥ 18 to ≤ 
65 years (103 [64.4%] subjects) in Study 1001, and in subjects 0 to < 6 years (28 [80.0%] subjects) and 
≥ 6 to < 12 years (36 [73.5%] subjects) in Study 3002. 
The proportion of related TEAEs was also similar in both age groups in Study 1001 (1 [7.1%] subjects ≥ 
12 to < 18 years and 12 [7.5%] subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years)  and in both age groups in Study 3002 (no 
subjects 0 to < 6 years and 1 [2.0%] subject ≥ 6 to < 12 years). 
In the interim data of Study 3001, AEs were reported in 1 (14.3%) subject 0 to < 6 years, 1 (6.7%) 
subject ≥ 6 to < 12 years, 7 (50.0%) subjects ≥ 12 to < 18 years, and 39 (33.1%) subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 
years. The safety profile of rVIII-SingleChain in the 2 age groups (0 to < 18 years and ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years) 
was consistent with what was documented in the pivotal studies.

Summary of AEs by Age (Safety Populations, Studies 1001 and 3002)  
Immunological events 
Inhibitors 
No subject developed an inhibitor under exposure to rVIII-SingleChain in any of the studies. In study 
3002, one paediatric subject with initially negative inhibitor-titre, retrospectively turned out to have had 
pre-existing inhibitor. A low-titre inhibitor was detected at 4 weeks on AFSTYLA; retrospectively, the 
negative screening test (central lab) was repeated and found to be positive. Furthermore, this subject had 
positive ADAs (IgG), initially, experienced a TEAE of hypersensitivity at his second treatment day which 
required treatment with antihistamines, and the subject experienced a TESAE of bacteraemia with chills 
and fever for central venous catheter infection. FVIII-substitution-dose was doubled (from 25 to 50 IU/kg 
3 times weekly) and inhibitor titre decreased. 
The Applicant has developed three methods for determining the anti-rVIII-SingleChain-antibodies. The 
assays to determine non-inhibitory ADAs have been appropriately validated. 
Information with regards to inhibitor development is provided in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Non-inhibitory Anti-drug Antibodies and Anti-CHO Antibodies 
Numbers of subjects with positive tests at baseline or any time post baseline for non-inhibitory ADAs are 
summarized: A subject’s result was counted as positive if the result from ADAs was positive and the test 
result for either IgG or immunoglobulin M (IgM) was also positive, otherwise the subject’s result was 
counted as negative: 
- In Study 1001, 8 subjects entered the study with positive non-inhibitory ADA (IgG and/or IgM) test. 
Four other subjects entered the study with negative ADA and turned positive for IgG and/or IgM during 
the study. 2 of them were negative at End-of-study. 
- In Study 3002, 10 subjects entered the study with a positive test for non-inhibitory ADAs. Ten other 
subjects entered the study with negative ADA and turned positive for non-inhibitory ADAs at some point 
during the study. 3 of them were negative at End-of-study. 
- In Study 3001, no further subjects developed an ADA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 89/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of 14 subjects, who turned positive after being negative for ADAs at baseline, the Applicant is asked to 
provide information on possible associated clinical symptoms (studies 1001 and 3002) and laboratory 
findings (especially relation of ADA positivity to lowering of RBC). No positive relationship was found. 
The Applicant was asked for the ADA-status of subjects with normocytic anaemia. However, ADAs were 
negative. 
None of the subjects who tested positive for non-inhibitory ADAs experienced TEAEs that, upon medical 
review, were assessed to be associated with any of the reported non-inhibitory ADAs. 
No subject in any of the rVIII-SingleChain clinical studies entered with anti-CHO host cell protein 
antibodies or developed these during the studies. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In Study 1001, the predefined search strategy with Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) identified 15 
subjects (8.5%) who experienced events that could be considered as symptoms or manifestations of 
hypersensitivity. 2 subjects (1.1%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Upon medical review by the 
sponsor, events of cough and sneezing were not considered to be associated with hypersensitivity 
reactions. None of the events identified were considered to be anaphylactic reactions.  
6 TEAEs indicative of hypersensitivity were considered to be related to the study drug in 4 of the subjects. 
In study 3002, the predefined search strategy with SMQs identified 13 subjects (15.5%) who experienced 
19 events that could be considered as symptoms or manifestations of hypersensitivity. All but 1 of these 
events (hypersensitivity) were considered as unrelated by the investigator. The related event of 
hypersensitivity was mild in intensity and the dose of rVIII-SingleChain was not changed as a result of this 
event. Respective subject has been described, above, as case-report of pre-existing inhibitor, 
ADA-positivity, catheter-related sepsis and hypersensitivity. 
In the interim data up to 29 May 2015 for Study 3001, the predefined search strategy with SMQs 
identified 4 subjects (all in the ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 year age group) who experienced AEs that were reported as 
hypersensitivity (eczema, rash pruritic, rash, and drug hypersensitivity). All but 1 of these events (drug 
hypersensitivity, see below) were considered as unrelated by the investigator and adjudicators. 
This subject with hypersensitivity: received 153 EDs in study 1001 and further 65 EDs in study 3001. He 
experienced a non-serious event of drug hypersensitivity. The event resolved after 1 day. 12 days later, 
the subject experienced positive re-challenge without the use of premedication and was withdrawn from 
the study. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. There were no such events observed in studies.  
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.  
Sodium content 
This medicine contains up to 7 mg (0.3 mmol) sodium per ml after reconstitution. To be taken into 
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.

Thromboembolic Events 
There were no intravascular TEEs in any of the 3 clinical studies. In Study 3002, 1 subject experienced a 
TESAE of device occlusion that was identified by the SMQ search “Embolic and thrombotic events”. 
Furthermore, risk for TEEs in the elderly population remains open, as no subject beyond 64 years of age 
has been followed in clinical studies, yet. 
Local Tolerability 
Local tolerability at the injection site was assessed by study subjects on a 5-point scale, and by the 
investigator using a 5-point scale for erythema and a separate 5-point scale for itching, local pain, or local 
heat, and by measuring the size of any edema or induration. 
In Study 1001, 99.3% of the 13,580 injections assessed by the subjects had no reactions. In Study 3002, 
99.4% of the 4,774 injections assessed by the subjects had no reactions. In Study 3001, 99.9% of the 
8,587 injections assessed have been reported by the subjects with no reactions. No severe local reactions 
were reported in any study. 
Overdose 
Any TEAE associated with ≥ 2 times the prescribed rVIII-SingleChain dose was considered as an overdose 
and was to be documented in the electronic case report form and reported to the sponsor within 72 h. 
One subject from study 1001 reported a TEAE that was associated with ≥ 2 times the prescribed 
rVIII-SingleChain dose. The subject was prescribed between 35-50 IU/kg rVIIISingleChain for a bleeding 
episode, but was administered 6 vials of Afstyla, which was 111.3 IU/kg. The subject complained of 
dizziness and feeling hot and itchy after taking the study drug and Tramal. The investigator rated these 
events as not related to study drug but to the co-administered analgesic. These events were summarized 
and coded to the PT “adverse drug reaction”, which was mild and not serious. 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Afstyla has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects were withdrawn from Study 1001 due to AEs. 
One subject was withdrawn from Study 3002 due to hip arthralgia. 
Two subjects have been withdrawn from Study 3001, due to AEs.

2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 91/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exposure and safety were assessed in all subjects who received a dose of rVIII-SingleChain as part of 
either a PK evaluation, on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis, or perioperative 
management of bleeding episodes. Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reporting, routine 
laboratory safety, local tolerability, vital signs, and physical examinations. Important identified and 
potential risks that are class effects for rFVIII and pdFVIII concentrates include hypersensitivity / 
anaphylactic reactions, development of inhibitors against FVIII, development of non-inhibitory ADAs and 
antibodies against CHO host cell proteins. 
According to the Guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant factor VIII and IX products, an overall 
number of 100 individuals is requested for pre-authorisation evaluation of general safety-aspects. At least 
50 subjects ≥ 12 years of age should be followed for at least 50 Exposure Days (ED) and at least 50 
children <12 years and separated into two age-cohorts of 25 subjects, each, should have reached 50 ED, 
too. Such requirements have been met by the presented numbers. 
Furthermore, 14 adolescents ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age were included into study 1001; 8 of 14 reached 
> 50 EDs and 2/14 >100 EDs. There is no requirement of specific numbers for adolescents in the clinical 
guideline. 
Standard Laboratory findings and Vital-signs- and Physical-findings-documentation was within expected 
range. 
Numbers of Adverse Events and AE-profile according to SOCs are in line with similar factor concentrates. 
26 TESAEs in 21 subjects were documented. Hypersensitivity was the most relevant symptom to be 
recognized in relation to Afstyla. One patient with pre-existing inhibitor experienced Hypersensitivity, and 
venous-device complication. 
Adverse events of special interest were documented and presented: One low-titre inhibitor 
retrospectively turned out to be pre-existent. Number of non-inhibitory ADAs did not raise concerns, 
although the numbers in children are higher than in adults. 
The Guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant FVIII and IX products does not request inclusion of 
elderly subjects. Of note, the clinical safety database of rVIII-SingleChain is limited regarding elderly 
patients. Although no subject experienced TEE, the constantly growing elderly population is at higher risk 
for thromboembolism. Experience in geriatric patients (65 years and above) has been included as missing 
information in the RMP (please see RMP section). 
Paediatric subjects have been included into study 1001 (adolescents, 12-<18 years of age), study 3002 
(< 12 years of age) and into study 3001 (0-<18years of age).  
In addition, Factor VIII monitoring errors due to discrepancy of one-stage versus 
chromogenic-test-results might not have been identified under clinical trials conditions although 
potentially a top-up dose might be given, which, while unnecessary, would not result in an additional risk 
for the affected patient. In healthy individuals, FVIII circulates in plasma at concentrations of 50 to 150 
IU/dL. However, FVIII is an acute-phase reactant, and plasma levels in healthy individuals without 
congenital bleeding disorders rise above 240% in acute situations such as surgery, sports, and infections. 
While chronically elevated FVIII levels have been identified as a risk factor for thrombosis in patients 
without congenital bleeding disorders that is not the case for acutely elevated FVIII plasma activity. Given 
the short plasma half-life of FVIII in haemophilia patients, high doses (even in a prophylaxis regimen) 
would never reach steady state (ie, chronically elevated levels). Adverse reactions due to dosing errors 
caused by misinterpretation of monitoring results are not biologically plausible and therefore are not 
anticipated. To avoid dosing errors due to discrepancy of one-stage versus chromogenic-test-results, a 
factor 2 for conversion of test results has been introduced.  
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 92/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional information in Previously Untreated Patients (PUPs) is crucial in the context of treatment in 
haemophilia A. Experience of inhibitor formation in PUPs has been included as missing information and 
development of inhibitors has been included as an important identified risk. 
In order to obtain further safety data (on the identified and potential risks described in the RMP below) in 
prophylaxis, on-demand long-term treatment and in surgery, the company should submit the results of 
Study 3001, a phase III open label, multicenter, extension study to assess the safety and efficacy of 
recombinant coagulation Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain, CSL627) in subjects with severe haemophilia A.  
In order to investigate the hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, development of inhibitors to factor 
VIII and potential dosing errors, the company should participate in EUHASS to collect long-term safety 
data. 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the Clinical Safety profile of AFSTYLA is comparable to other factor concentrates.  
Experience of inhibitor formation in PUPs has been included as missing information and development of 
inhibitors has been included as an important identified risk. 
Factor FVIII dosing errors might occur due to discrepancy of one-stage versus chromogenic test results. 
However, adverse reactions due to such dosing errors are not biological plausible and thus not 
anticipated. To avoid dosing errors a conversion factor of 2 has been introduced.  
Hence, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety (please 
see RMP section below): 
- In order to obtain further safety data (on the important identified and potential risks described in the 
RMP) in prophylaxis, on-demand long-term treatment and in surgery, the company should submit the 
results of Study 3001, a phase III open label, multicenter, extension study to assess the safety and 
efficacy of recombinant coagulation Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain, CSL627) in subjects with severe 
haemophilia A. 
- In order to investigate the hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, development of inhibitors to factor 
VIII and potential dosing errors, the company should participate in EUHASS to collect long-term safety 
data.

was used to provide adequate justification for bridging the Readability User Test results for Biostate 250 
IU/600 IU to the proposed package leaflet of Afstyla. The bridging was justified with a comparison of both 
leaflets with regard to the key elements and identification of only minor differences between parent 
(Biostate) and daughter (Afstyla) leaflet. All key safety messages of the daughter PL are also present in 
the parent leaflet and the additional text is written in similar patient friendly language. The changes in 
wording of the daughter leaflets were considered to improve readability and the minor differences in the 
layout of the daughter PL were considered to maintain or improve clarity of the parent PL layout.  
The justification is considered to be acceptable and no separate User Testing for Afstyla has to be 
provided. 
2.12.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Afstyla (lonoctocog alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because 
inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, 
non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. Rarely, 
life-threatening bleeding may also occur. Patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the 
extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient FVIII that is used to classify the disease severity (WFH, 
2012): 
•  <1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
•  1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
•  5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
Afstyla is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most patients with severe haemophilia require treatment of bleeding episodes and may require regular 
supplementation with intravenous (IV) factor replacement, either plasma-derived concentrate or 
recombinant. The goal of haemophilia therapy is to treat or prevent haemorrhage, thereby reducing 
disabling joint and tissue damage, and improving morbidity and the patient’s quality of life. Replacement 
therapy with FVIII in haemophilia A provides a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and the 
bleeding tendencies. The prophylactic treatment course is variable and individually determined. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Afstyla, a recombinant single-chain human coagulation factor VIII, was developed for replacement 
therapy of patients with haemophilia A.  
Clinical efficacy of rFVIII-SingleChain has been investigated in two Phase 3 studies in adults and 
adolescents ≥ 12 years of age and in children <12 years of age in a step-wise approach. 
rFVIII-SingleChain efficacy was investigated in treatment of bleeds, routine prophylaxis and perioperative 
management by assessment of treatment response rating, rFVIII-SingleChain consumption for a dose of 
20-50 IU/kg administered 2 to 3 times weekly and determination of ABR. PK data serve as an important 
surrogate endpoint. 
In the treatment of bleeds, response was assessed as “excellent” or “good” for more than 90% of 
rFVIII-SingleChain injections in both Phase 3 studies. More than 80% of the occurred bleeds were treated 
with one injection with a median dose of ~30 IU/kg in subjects ≥12 years and ~35 IU/kg in subjects <12 
years of age. Median ABRs during prophylaxis are 1.14 in subjects ≥12 years and 3.69 bleeds/year in 
subjects <12 years of age. 
A sufficient number of major surgeries were evaluated with haemostasis assessed as “excellent” or 
“good” in all of them. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016  
Page 97/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy has been demonstrated by low ABR and FVIII-consumption comparable to marketed FVIII 
products and high-level of haemostatic efficacy in bleeding episodes and surgical setting. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No important uncertainties about the key favourable effects have been identified. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The risk-profile of Afstyla might be described by well-known risks from other Factor VIII concentrates 
together with anticipated risks according to specifically introduced changes of the molecule when 
compared with the native FVIII. AE-documentation from submitted Clinical studies 1001 (pivotal PK and 
efficacy-study), 3002 (paediatric study) and preliminary results from the ongoing extension study 3001 
serves as the main source of information. Well-known risks include inhibitor development, 
hypersensitivity reactions, thrombo-embolic events, development of ADAs and anti-CHO antibodies. 
For Afstyla, no de-novo inhibitor has been documented, so far. Hypersensitivity-reactions have been 
identified in nine subjects (rated as related in 6 subjects), of which one needed treatment with steroids 
and antihistamines for a limited period of time.  There was one other patient with pre-existing inhibitor 
and positive ADAs who also experienced hypersensitivity. 
Non-inhibitory ADAs were detected during the treatment among patients negative at baseline. No clinical 
relevance has been identified, yet. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A high discrepancy was noted between results obtained with the OS and the ChS assay: the one-stage 
clotting assay result underestimates the factor VIII activity level compared to the chromogenic assay 
result by approximately 45%.. The linear relationship across critical FVIII activity levels demonstrated a 
consistent proportional decrease in OS FVIII activity measurements. Thus, the applicant proposes to 
include a conversion factor of 2 into the SmPC posology recommendations which should align OS activity 
levels with ChS activity results.  
Factor VIII monitoring errors due to discrepancy of one-stage versus chromogenic-test-results might not 
have been identified under clinical trials conditions although potentially causing a top-up dose to be given, 
which, while unnecessary, would not result in an additional risk for the affected patient. In healthy 
individuals, FVIII circulates in plasma at concentrations of 50 to 150 IU/dL. However, FVIII is an 
acute-phase reactant, and plasma levels in healthy individuals without congenital bleeding disorders rise 
above 240% in acute situations such as surgery, sports, and infections. While chronically elevated FVIII 
levels have been identified as a risk factor for thrombosis in patients without congenital bleeding 
disorders, that is not the case for acutely elevated FVIII plasma activity. Given the short plasma half-life 
of FVIII in haemophilia patients, high doses (even in a prophylaxis regimen) would never reach steady 
state (ie, chronically elevated levels). Adverse reactions due to dosing errors caused by misinterpretation 
of monitoring results are not biologically plausible and therefore are not anticipated . This has been 
included an important potential risk. 
Studies enrolled elderly patients only to a very low extent (two patients so far ≥60 years).  
Hence, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety (please 
see RMP section):

- In order to obtain further safety data (on the important identified and potential risks described in the 
RMP) in prophylaxis, on-demand long-term treatment and in surgery, the company should submit the 
results of Study 3001, a phase III open label, multicenter, extension study to assess the safety and 
efficacy of recombinant coagulation Factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain, CSL627) in subjects with severe 
haemophilia A. 
- In order to investigate the hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, development of inhibitors to factor 
VIII and potential dosing errors, the company should participate in EUHASS to collect long-term safety 
data.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A FVIII product’s beneficial effects of maintaining haemostasis in haemophilia A patients are of obvious 
importance, since they result in an improvement of the quality of life and increased life-expectancy, and 
they could adequately be shown and expected for rFVIII-SingleChain. 
Additional information in Previously Untreated Patients (PUPs) is crucial in the context of treatment in 
haemophilia A. Experience of inhibitor formation in PUPs has been included as missing information and 
development of inhibitors has been included as an important identified risk. 
Hypersensitivities have been identified as relevant regarding number and quality. As current database for 
this newly developed single chain product is restricted, this entity of unfavourable effects requires further 
follow-up post-marketing. This will be monitored in Study 3001 and in EUHASS Registry (please see 
RMP).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the currently available data, the benefit-risk balance is considered to be positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not Applicable.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Afstyla is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Afstyla is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to 
be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lonoctocog alfa is considered to 
Assessment report  
EMA/795172/2016

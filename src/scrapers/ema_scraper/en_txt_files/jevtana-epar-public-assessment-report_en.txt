2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Prostate  cancer  is  a  major  worldwide  health  problem  and  is  the  most  frequently  diagnosed  male 
malignancy, with 301,500 cases of prostate cancer documented in 2006 in the EU. 
Initial treatment 
The  initial  treatment  for  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  prostate  consists  of  androgen  ablation, 
either  surgically  with  bilateral  orchiectomy,  or  medically  with  luteinizing  hormone-releasing  hormone 
(LH-RH)  receptor  agonists.  At  this  stage,  further  hormonal  manipulations  such  as  treatment  with 
antiandrogens,  and  subsequent  antiandrogen  withdrawal  can  be  associated  with  responses  of  short 
duration but without improvement in survival duration.  
Patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (mHRPC) 
Treatment options for patients with hormone-refractory disease remain limited and include palliation of 
symptoms (especially pain) and/or systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prior to the approval of Taxotere 
in  2004,  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  was  not  routinely  administered  to  patients  with  hormone  refractory 
metastatic  prostate  cancer  (HRPC).  The  therapeutic  options  and  clinical  treatment  for  such  patients 
were  limited  to  cyclophosphamide,  anthracyclines  and  anthracycline  types  (doxorubicin  and 
mitoxantrone),  and  estramustine  (combination  alkylating  agent  and  hormone).  Single  agent 
chemotherapy has been associated with palliative effects but no single agent has been associated with 
an objective response rate greater than 30%. Combinations of cytotoxic agents have been investigated 
with evidence of enhanced activity in terms of palliation and prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline but 
the safety profile of these combinations remains a limitation, especially in elderly men with concurrent 
medical  problems  and  limited  bone  marrow  reserve.  Although  the  role  for  chemotherapy  in  symptom 
palliation and PSA response was well established, the efficacy of these regimens was relatively modest 
and no survival advantage had been demonstrated with any of the treatments. Based on results from 
two  Phase  3  trials,  the  combination  of  mitoxantrone  with  corticosteroids  was  established  as  the 
reference  treatment  in  metastatic  HRPC.  Taxotere  in  combination  with  prednisone  was  approved  in 
2004 for the treatment of androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer patients. A combination of 
docetaxel and estramustine was associated with a clinical benefit in terms of overall survival, time to 
tumour progression (TTP), and 50% decline in PSA, compared with mitoxantrone-treated patients.  
Patients with mHRPC previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen 
The standard of treatment for patients with mHRPC who progress following Taxotere as standard first 
line therapy is evolving, with no therapy approved for treatment of such patients. Palliative effects with 
respect  to  pain  control  have  been  observed  in  HRPC  patients  following  the  administration  of  either 
corticosteroid  alone  [Tannock  I  et  al  (1989)  J  Clin  Oncol  &(5):590-7]  or  mitoxantrone  administered 
with  either  prednisone  or  hydrocortisone  [Osoba  D  et  al  (1999)  J  Clin  Oncol  17(6):  1654-63,  Kantoff 
PW et al (1999) J CLin Oncol 17(8): 2506-13]. Supportive care, with various non-approved agents with 
limited activity, is currently used in this setting, palliation being the main goal of therapy [et al (2010) 
Cancer Treat Rev 36(6):501-6]. Finally, several new investigational agents are being tested in patients 
who progress during or after receiving a Taxotere-based regimen in the first line setting.  
About the product 
Cabazitaxel is  a  semi-synthetic  derivative  of  the  10-deacetyl  Baccatin  III, which is  extracted  typically 
from  European  yew  needles,  that  promotes  tubulin  assembly  in  vitro  and  stabilises  microtubules 
against cold-induced depolymerization.  
The indication applied for initially and finally approved was the following: 
Jevtana in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
The  Applicant  requested  scientific  advice  for  cabazitaxel  in  January  2009  pursuant  to  Article  57(1)(n) 
of  Council  Regulation  No  (EC)  726/2004.  During  the  plenary  meeting  held  on  16-19  March  2009,  the 
CHMP  adopted  the  co-ordinators’  report  and  agreed  on  the  advice  to  be  given  to  the  Company. 
(EMEA/H/SAWP/137528/2009). All questions were on drug product.  
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  drug  substance  is  cabazitaxel  acetone  solvate.  Cabazitaxel  is  the  7,10-dimethoxy  analogue  of 
docetaxel.  Cabazitaxel  (Jevtana)  is  a  new  member  of  the  Taxane  family.  Other  compounds  in  this 
group  include  docetaxel  and  paclitaxel.  Many  of  these  low-aqueous  solubility  compounds  can  be 
solubilised for intravenous infusion by using a combination of alcohols and non-ionic surfactants, in this 
particular case ethanol and polysorbate 80. 
The  product  is  supplied  as  a  sterile  non-aqueous  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing 
cabazitaxel  60mg/1.5ml  packaged  in  a  glass  vial,  and  an  additional  solvent  for  dilution  of  the 
Concentrate The Solvent is a sterile, non pyrogenic 13% w/w aqueous solution of ethanol. The solvent 
is a clear colourless liquid and is packaged in a glass vial. The concentrate and the solvent are intended 
for the preparation of a premix solution of cabazitaxel at 10mg/ml prior to dilution with 0.9% saline or 
5% dextrose solution in an infusion bag. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  INN  name  of  the  active  substance  as  base 
(2α,5β,7β,10β,13α)-4-(acetyloxy)-13-({(2R,3S)3-[(tertbutoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-
phenylpropanoyl}oxy)-1-hydroxy-7,10-dimethoxy-9-oxo  5, 20-epoxytax-11-en-2-yl  benzoate-propan-
2-one (1:1). The molecular formula of active substance is C45H57NO14. C3H6O its relative molecular 
mass 894.01 (acetone solvate), 835.93 (solvent free) and its structural formula is shown below. 
is  cabazitaxel.  The  chemical  name 
is 
Cabazitaxel is a white to almost white non hygroscopic crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water. 
Cabazitaxel acetone  solvate  contains 11  asymmetric  centers.  The  specific  stereochemistry is  fixed  for 
each centre as shown in above structure. Its logP is 3.88 ± 0.03, at 24°C, pH 7 in presence of 0.15 M 
KCl. 
Cabazitaxel  shows  polymorphism.  Acetone  solvate  (Form  A)  was  selected  on  basis  of  manufacturing 
feasibility, reproducibility, and of stability.  
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process of cabazitaxel comprises a number of steps that yields the desired 
polymorph. If required, reprocessing of any intermediate or drug substance batch is foreseen in 
accordance with ICH Q7A guideline by repeating all or part of the related process step. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010 
Page 7/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sufficient information has been presented regarding the critical steps and intermediates, including in-
process controls (IPC). 
Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  appearance  of  solution  (Ph 
Eur  ),    identification  (IR,  HPLC),  specific  optical  rotation  (Ph  Eur  ),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances 
(HPLC), sulphated ash (Ph Eur ), heavy metals (Ph Eur ), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur ), water content 
(Ph Eur ), microbial contamination (Ph Eur ), residual solvents (GC) and acetone content (GC). 
Only one reagent used in the synthesis of cabazitaxel is considered potentially genotoxic. A TTC value 
of  20  μg  /day  (based  on  the  intended  cabazitaxel  dose  in  human  (25  mg/m2  i.e.  ~  40  mg/day)), 
corresponds to a limit of 500 ppm in cabazitaxel acetone solvate. Results of 6 batches shows that the 
levels  of  the  genotoxic  material  determined  using a  validated  GC  method  are  consistently  well  below 
the calculated TTC value and routine determination is therefore not deemed necessary.  
Results  from  more  than  10  batches,  three  of  which  commercial  scale,  have  been  presented,  showing 
that the production process together with the specifications set at the different stages upstream in the 
synthesis allow the manufacture of drug substance batches complying with the specification proposed.  
Stability 
Stability data are presented for three full-scale representative batches for which 12-month data under 
long-term  conditions  (5°C)  and  6-month  data  under  accelerated  conditions  (25°C/60%RH)  are 
available. 
Supportive  stability  data  on  one  full-scale  batch  for  which  36-month  data  under  long-term  conditions 
and 6-month data under accelerated conditions were also presented. 
All data are well within the proposed specification. No significant change has been observed for any of 
the parameters tested. 
Stress  stability  testing  allowed  the  determination  of  degradation  pathways  and  appropriateness  of 
analytical procedures for stability. 
Photo-stability study was conducted on one primary stability batch according to ICH Q1B. Cabazitaxel 
acetone  solvate  is  slightly  photosensitive,  when  exposed  to  intense  light.  However  no  special 
precaution of storage to light is added, because the substance is stored under refrigerated conditions 
and is packaged in suitable package. 
Based on the stability data provided a re-test period of 24 months when stored between 2-8°C in the 
proposed container is proposed. 
In  accordance  with  EU  good  manufacturing  practices  (GMP)  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of 
specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  proposed  medicinal  product  is  a  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  at  60 mg/1.5 ml,  supplied 
with a solvent vial containing 4.5 ml of a 13% w/w aqueous solution of ethanol (96 per cent) for the 
preparation  of  an  intermediate  premix  at  10  mg/ml,  prior  to  dilution  with  0.9  %  sodium  chloride 
solution or 5 % dextrose solution in an infusion bag. The product is a micellar formulation intended for 
intravenous use only. 
The use of cabazitaxel Form A was justified on the basis that the product is a parenteral concentrate 
and any potential physico-chemical impact of the choice of initial solid form would not be critical. 
The formulation of cabazitaxel concentrate for solution for infusion was established taking into account 
prior in-house knowledge from development of other taxoid parenteral products (Taxotere-docetaxel), 
which met the same intended target product profile. 
The  provided  information  is  supportive  enough  to  consider  acceptable  the  transposition  of  the 
formulation  marketed  with  docetaxel  to  the  new  entity  cabazitaxel,  without  further  optimization.  Like

docetaxel  (Taxotere),  cabazitaxel  has  poor  aqueous  solubility  (8μg/ml)  and  surfactants  such  as 
polysorbate  80  are  required  to  solubilise  it.  Because  it  is  difficult  to  achieve  homogeneity  by  direct 
mixing  of  a  polysorbate  solution  with  water,  a  concentrate  is  supplied  with  an  aqueous  solvent 
containing  13%w/w  ethanol  to  allow  the  preparation  of  a  premix  at  10  mg/ml  which  could  then  be 
diluted in infusion medium prior to administration.  
Upon  dilution  in  water,  surfactants  such  as  polysorbate  80  are  known  to  extemporaneously 
spontaneously  form,  above  a  certain  concentration,  micellar  solutions  that  increase  solubility  of  poor 
soluble  drugs,  like  cabazitaxel  acetone  solvate,  in  an  aqueous  environment.  The  optimum  pH  for 
satisfactory stability of cabazitaxel concentrate has been defined conducting a study using polysorbate 
80 at various pHs.  
Stability of the micellar system in infusion solutions has been studied. It has been demonstrated that 
the  micellar  system  is  capable  of  ensuring  chemical  and  physical  stability  of  the  formulation  in  the 
recommended conditions for use as per the SmPC.  
Based  on  the  above,  it  can  be  considered  that  cabazitaxel  is  almost  totally  micelle-solubilised  for 
infusion  solutions.  A  safety  margin  is  kept  though  by  reducing  the  recommended  maximum  storage 
durations at the different temperatures. 
Extensive experimentation has been carried out to assess the risk of drug precipitation resulting from 
super  saturation.  Results  presented  ensure  that  crystallization  is  avoided  by  application  of  the 
appropriate instructions of the SmPC. 
Chemical and physical compatibility studies were conducted on cabazitaxel infusion solutions prepared 
at a concentration ranging between 0.10 and 0.26 mg/ml with 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose in different 
infusion  containers  and  the  use  of  PVC/DEHP  bags  and  of  polyurethane  sets  have  been  excluded. 
Stability  was  demonstrated  for  48  hours  under  refrigerated  conditions.  As  an  added  precaution  to 
ensure there is no risk of crystallization, the recommendations for storage of the infusion solutions at 
ambient temperatures will be limited to 8 hours. 
The sterile finished product is intended for single-use only and meets the Pharmacopoeia requirements 
for sterility and bacterial endotoxins.  
An in-use study mimicking infusion conditions showed that the micellar system is stable from start to 
end of infusion and is not perturbed by the use of filter. 
Ethanol  is  also  used  as  co-solvent  in  the  solvent  for  dilution  accompanying  the  drug  product. 
Compatibility of the excipients with cabazitaxel acetone solvate is demonstrated from stability studies. 
The  solvent  for  dilution is  identical in qualitative  composition  and  concentration  of  ethanol  as  used in 
the dilution of the already marketed Taxotere 
The  ethanol  aqueous  solvent  for  dilution  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  is  the  same  as  for 
Taxotere. 
Overfills of the concentrate vial and of the solvent vial were proposed to ensure a premix solution of 10 
mg/ml and a nominal volume of 6ml can be withdrawn from the premix vial for dilution in infusion bag. 
Closure integrity testing was performed. All test vials and negative controls were found to be negative 
for  microbial  growth  and  all  positive  controls  were  found  to  be  positive  for  microbial  growth 
respectively which demonstrated the integrity of the container closure.  
The  packaging  components  for  the  solvent  are  the  same  as  the  ones  for  the  drug  product  vial 
(concentrate)  and  the  same  as  the  ones  used  for  accompanying  solvent  for  dilution  for  the  currently 
marketed Taxotere.  
Manufacturing  process  development  was  based  on  the  manufacturing  process  of  Taxotere.  A 
documented  justification  for  not  choosing  terminal  sterilization  as  the  method  for  sterilization  is 
provided.  Sterilizing  filtration  is  thus  applied.  The  sterilizing  filters  used  have  been  validated  for 
microbial retention efficacy, integrity and compatibility. The suitability of filters was also demonstrated 
by suitable method. As far as the solvent is concerned it is terminally sterilised. 
Closure integrity for both the concentrate and the solvent has been validated through microbial ingress 
test. 
Adventitious agents 
Not  applicable.  No  materials  of  animal  or  human  origin  are  used  in  the manufacturing  of  cabazitaxel, 
concentrate for solution for infusion, neither for the solvent for dilution for cabazitaxel.

Stability of the product 
For the solvent, stability studies are presented for three batches stored under long term conditions at 
5°C,  25°C/60%RH  and  30°C/65%RH  up  to  12  months  and  under  accelerated  conditions  at 
40°C/75%RH up to 6 months only. All tested parameters are within the proposed specification. 
Supportive  stability  data  are  presented  for  the  solvent  for  dilution  used  in  conjunction  with  the 
currently marketed Taxotere is identical to the proposed solvent for dilution up to 36 months for three 
commercial  scale  batches  stored  under  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions.  All  data  are  within  the 
proposed specification. 
Results from photostability studies carried out in line with ICH guidelines show that the product is not 
affected by light. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  provided  the  proposed  shelf-life  when  stored  in  the  proposed  container  is 
considered acceptable for the solvent. 
For the concentrate, stability studies were undertaken from full scale three batches manufactured with 
the  proposed  process  under  ICH  long-term,  intermediate  and  accelerated  conditions  (i.e.  5°C, 
25°C/60%  RH,  30°C/65%  RH,  and  40°C/75%  RH).  Results  are  available  for  up  to  12  months  of 
storage  at  5°C  and  25°C,  up  to  18  months  at  30°C  and  up  to  6  months  at  40°C.  The  samples  are 
packaged in that identical to the commercial one. For each condition vials were stored inverted in order 
to assess any product interaction/degradation with the stopper during long term storage. 
One batch among primary stability batches was subjected to photostability according to ICH guideline. 
Results showed that the product is not sensitive to when packaged in the proposed primary packaging 
system. 
A freeze/thaw cycling study was also conducted. All data were within the proposed specification. 
Results  showed  no  significant  change  in  any  of  the  parameters  tested  had  been  observed  after  6 
months  of  storage  under  accelerated  condition  (40°C/75%  RH).  No  significant  change  in  any  of  the 
parameters  tested  had  been  observed  after  18  months  of  storage  under  long-term  condition 
(30°C/65% RH). Since a significant change was observed upon storage at 5 ± 3°C, the additional label 
“Do not refrigerate” was added. 
Based  on  the  overall  physico-chemical  data  generated  during  the  compatibility/in-use  studies,  it  is 
recommended: 
- not to use PVC bags and polyurethane infusion sets for cabazitaxel infusion solutions,

2.2.4.  Discussion and Conclusion on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The quality of Jevtana concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion is considered to be acceptable 
when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Information  on  development, 
manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The 
quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently described and adequately supported by data. 
Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and 
control  of  the  drug  product  has  been  presented.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two quality issues that will be resolved 
as  Follow-up  Measures  within  an  agreed  timeframe.  However,  none  of  them  is  expected  to  have  a 
negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Cabazitaxel  (also  known  as  XRP6258,  RPR116258A)  is  a  semi  synthetic  derivative  from  10-deacetyl 
Baccatin III, which is extracted typically from European yew needles. 
Primary pharmacology studies were conducted in mice and safety pharmacology studies in mice, rats, 
rabbits and dogs. Pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies were primarily conducted in mice, rats and 
dogs. Certain pharmacokinetic studies were also conducted in rabbits and monkeys. With the exception 
of  the local  tolerance  in  rabbits,  all in vivo  studies submitted  used  the  intravenous  route,  similarly  to 
the clinical route of administration.  
toxicity, 
Single-  and  repeated-dose 
haemocompatibility  and  local  tolerance  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with  Good 
Laboratory  Practices  (GLP)  regulations.    All  GLP  studies  were  conducted  using  fully  characterised 
batches of drug substances that were representative of the clinical and/or commercial product in terms 
of  impurity  content,  including  genotoxic  impurities.  All  studies  in  primary  pharmacology,  in 
pharmacokinetic studies and in toxicology conducted to determine doses for subsequent  studies were 
performed according to internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The Applicant has provided numerous in vitro and in vivo studies investigating the antitumour activity 
of  Cabazitaxel  in  several  tumour  cell  lines  and  various  cancer  models  sensitive  or  resistant  to 
docetaxel. However, data related to the proposed therapeutic indication are very limited.  
In  vitro,  Cabazitaxel  demonstrated  anti-tumour  activity  in  sensitive  murine  and  human  cell  lines. 
Cabazitaxel showed a cytotoxic activity similar to docetaxel (IC 50 values post 4 days exposure ranging

from 0,004 to 0,035 μmol/L, corresponding to 3 to 29 ng/mL). For docetaxel, IC50 values ranged from 
0.0077 to 0.061 µmol/L (6.2 to 49 ng/mL). 
Moreover,  as  docetaxel  was  found  to  be  a  metabolite  of  Cabazitaxel,  the  in  vitro  activity  of  the  2 
precursors  of  docetaxel,  RPR123142  (10-O-demethyl-cabazitaxel)  and  RPR  112698(7-O-demethyl-
Cabazitaxel), were also tested against the P388 cell line after 4 days of continuous exposure. 
The two metabolites showed cytotoxic activity with comparable IC 50 values with regard to cabazitaxel 
using the same cell line.  
In  vitro,  Cabazitaxel  demonstrated  activity  in  several  murine  and  human  resistant  cell  lines.  The 
selected cell lines included cell lines expressing the multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1) and tumour cell 
lines resistant to selected chemotherapeutic agents. However, no docetaxel-resistant prostate tumour 
cell line was tested for cross resistance to Cabazitaxel. 
Cabazitaxel  was  evaluated  by  the  IV  route  using  different  intermittent  schedules.  It  demonstrated 
activity  against  several  human  tumours  xenografted  in  mice  including  advanced  cancers.  Regarding 
prostate cancer, only one study is available investigating the activity of Cabazitaxel against advanced 
stage SC DU 145 (a human prostate adenocarcinoma) on Swiss nude female mice.   
The schedule dependency was investigated using non tumour-bearing mice and mice bearing early 
mammary adenocarcinoma. According to in vivo data, Cabazitaxel showed a trend for schedule 
dependency with maximum tolerated dosages 2.4- and 4.8-fold higher with a daily (day 1 to 5) and an 
intermittent (day 1 and 5) schedule, respectively, than with a split-dose schedule (day 1 to 5, 3 times 
a day). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  affinity  of  Cabazitaxel  on  receptor  binding  sites  was  evaluated  on  binding  sites  involved  in  the 
regulation  of  numerous  physiological  functions.  These  included  classical  neurotransmitters,  labelled 
binding  sites  on  protein  involved  in  uptake  processes  and  in  some  central  nervous  system  regulatory 
processes.  
Labelled  binding  sites  present  in  2  ion  channels  (verapamil-sensitive  Ca++,  tetrodotoxin-sensitive  Na+ 
and batrachotoxin-sensitive Na+) were also studied.  
Cabazitaxel  was  ineffective  in  displacing  the  25  studied  radioligands  from  their  specific  binding  sites 
whatever the concentration tested.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
No  physiologically  relevant  effects  were  noted  in  the  central  nervous,  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal 
systems after IV administration of cabazitaxel (from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg corresponding to 3 to 30 mg/m2) 
in  rats  and  no  interactions  with  various  spasmogens  were  observed  in  vitro  in  guinea-pig  ileum 
preparations up to 10 µmol/L (8360 ng/mL). 
Some  increase  in  urinary  K+  and  Cl-  concentrations  were  observed  in  rats  at  1.5  mg/kg  (9  mg/m2) 
during  the  0-3  hours  measurement  period  and  decrease  in  urinary  K+  was  observed  at  1.5  and  5 
mg/kg  (corresponding  to  9  and  30  mg/m2)  during  the  6-24  hours  measurement  period.    No  specific 
findings on the renal system were observed in rats in other toxicity studies. 
Cabazitaxel  was  devoid  of  effect  on  human  ether-a-go-go  related  gene  (hERG)  currents  up  to  30 
µmol/L  (corresponding  to  26  821  ng/mL,  limit  of  solubility)  and  did  not  modify  the  action  potential 
parameters  of  sheep  Purkinje  fiber  in  vitro  preparations  at  up  to  10  µmol/L  (8360  ng/mL).  The 
concentration  of  26  821  ng/mL  corresponded  to  approximately  50-fold  the  maximum  concentration 
(C max) of cabazitaxel achieved in human patients receiving the therapeutic dose of 25 mg/m2.  
Furthermore, cabazitaxel infused over approximately 1 hour at 0.45 mg/kg (9 mg/m2) in anesthetised 
dogs produced similar cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes (decrease in arterial blood pressure, 
left  ventricular  systolic  pressure,  left  ventricular  dp/dtP-1,  cardiac  output,  stroke  volume  and 
occasional  increase  in  RR  interval,  QT  and  QTc,  decrease  in  PR  interval)  to  those  noted  after  the 
administration of the vehicle alone (PS80/ethanol/5% glucose) and were therefore likely attributable to 
the PS80 component of the vehicle (non specific histamine releaser in dogs). 
Due  to  the  very  poor  solubility  of  cabazitaxel,  it  was  not  possible  to  use  an  inactive  solvent  to  avoid 
PS80  effects.  No  specific  study  with  conscious  telemetered  dogs  were  considered  necessary  with 
cabazitaxel as electrocardiography (ECG) evaluations have been performed in the 13-cycle intravenous 
toxicity  study  in  non  anesthetised  dogs  up  to  0.5  mg/kg/adm  (10  mg/m2/adm)  and  no  compound-

related  effects  were  observed  on  any  parameters.  However  increases  in  heart  rate  values  associated 
with decreases in PR interval values (as compared to the respective pre-test values) were noted in all 
groups  at  the  end  of  infusion  on  each  dosing  cycle.    These  changes  were  considered  related  to  the 
PS80  content  in  the  vehicle  administered  since  heart  rate  and  PR  interval  values  were  altered  to  the 
same  extent  in  control  and  cabazitaxel-treated  dogs.    Heart  rate  and  PR  interval  duration  were  no 
longer modified (as compared to the respective pre-test values) when measured 24 hours after dosing, 
at any dosing cycle and dose level.  Consequently, in pre-clinical studies, cabazitaxel did not produce 
by  itself  cardiovascular  effects  and  the  applicant  states  that  no  cardiovascular  effects  have  been 
reported in human in the different clinical trials.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No formal drug interactions studies were carried out. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  studies  were  performed  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  After  single  or  repeated 
administration,  Cabazitaxel  plasma  exposures  increased  with  dose  and  no  plasma  accumulation  was 
observed in all species.  
No gender effect was observed except in one study (single-dose toxicity study in dogs) at the highest 
dose.

Methods 
Studies  were  conducted  using  [14C]-cabazitaxel  with  a  radiochemical  purity  above  97.5%,  which  is 
suitable for the purpose of these studies. The isotope labelling was biologically stable.  
Concentrations  were  measured  by  liquid  scintillation  counting  for  radioactivity  in  biological  samples, 
and/or  by  autoradioluminography  for  radioactivity  in  tissues  and/or  by  High  Performance  Liquid 
Chromatography  (HPLC)  with  mass  spectrometric  detection  or  radiometric  detection  for  the  parent 
drug  and  its  metabolites.    The  bioanalytical  assay  methods  fulfilled  the  requirements  in  terms  of 
specificity,  reproducibility,  repeatability,  accuracy  and  precision  to  carry  out  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicokinetic  studies  in  animal  species.    In  addition,  these  assay  methods  allowed  the  full  resolution 
between cabazitaxel and two pharmacologically active metabolites docetaxel and RPR123142 that were 
monitored/documented in some studies.  Limits of quantification in plasma (LC-MS/MS methods) were 
in the range of 2.39-4.78 ng/mL for cabazitaxel, in the range of 2.50 to 5.00 ng/mL for docetaxel and 
1.00  ng/mL  for  RPR123142.  In  most  cases,  bioanalytical  methods  allowed  determination  of  plasma 
levels of cabazitaxel up to 4 to 168 hours post dosing, sufficient for an accurate determination of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters.  Incurred sample short-term stability was demonstrated in rats and dogs 
for cabazitaxel.   
Absorption 
Exposure  to  cabazitaxel  increased  with  dose  after  single  or  repeated  IV  administration  in  all  species. 
The  increase  in  exposure  was  approximately  dose  proportional  in  mice  and  more  than  dose 
proportional in rats and dogs.   
No plasma accumulation was observed in mice, rats or dogs after five-daily or weekly administrations 
or after administration every 3 weeks.   
No  gender  effect  was  observed  in  rats  and  dogs.    Very  low  to  low  levels  of  metabolites  RPR123142 
(10-O-demethyl-cabazitaxel)  and  docetaxel  (di-O-demethyl-cabazitaxel)  were  measured.    The 
metabolic  ratio  of  docetaxel  versus  cabazitaxel  was  3.6%  in  tumour  bearing  mice  after  single 
administration while docetaxel was detected at only one sampling time at the highest dose tested (10 
mg/kg)  in  the  single  toxicity  study  in  rats.    In  addition,  docetaxel  was  not  detected  in  rabbits  in  the 
dose range finding toxicity study or in dogs in the single dose, 5-day and single-cycle toxicity studies. 
In the multiple cycle studies, the metabolic ratio of RPR123142 versus cabazitaxel ranged from 1% to 
10% in rats while RPR123142 was only quantifiable at one sampling time in dogs, at the highest dose 
tested (0.5 mg/kg/administration).  
Distribution 
Cabazitaxel exhibited a large volume of distribution in all the species, suggestive of a large diffusion of 
the drug (in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, in hematopoietic organs and in various glandular 
structures (pancreas, pituitary, submaxillary gland, ovaries, prostate and adrenals)).  
Plasma protein binding of cabazitaxel was very high in mice (99.3%) and high in rats (95.5%), rabbits 
(91.4%), dogs (97.1%) and humans (91.9%) with no trend of saturation in the concentration range of 
50 to 1000 ng/mL.  At higher concentrations (up to 50 000 ng/mL) a trend toward saturation was 
observed in rabbits (above 1000 ng/mL), in mice (above 5000 ng/mL) and in dogs (above 10 000 
ng/mL) and not in rats and humans. 
Radioactivity  exposure  in  the  brain  correlated  with  blood  exposure  and  was  therefore  higher  in  mice 
than  in  rats  and  dogs.  Low  placental  transfer  (0.014%)  of  radioactivity  (66%  being  Cazabitaxel)  was 
observed in rat foetuses. 
Metabolism 
Cabazitaxel metabolism was investigated in vitro and/or in vivo, in the different animal species used in 
toxicological studies (Crl:CD-1(ICR)BR and C3H/HeN mouse, Sprague Dawley rat, New Zealand White 
rabbit, Beagle dog and Cynomolgus monkey) and in human. 
The  goal  of  the  in  vivo  metabolic  studies  was  to  investigate  the  fate  of  the  drug  in  animal  species 
following  a  single  IV  administration.  In  addition,  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  metabolic  studies  allowed 
comparison  of  both  Cabazitaxel  metabolic  rates  and  profiles  between  various  animal  species  and 
human.

Cabazitaxel was extensively metabolised by the liver.  
The main routes of biotransformation consisted of: 
- 10-O-demethylation leading to RPR123142, 
- 7-O-demethylation leading to RPR112698, 
-  hydroxylation  on  t-butyl  moiety  in  the  lateral  chain,  followed  by  cyclisation  of  the  lateral  chain 
giving rise to oxazolidine-type compounds, 
- cleavage of Cabazitaxel leading to the loss of the taxane ring. 
In vivo, the parent drug was the main circulating compound in mouse, rat and dog plasma (≥ 65% of 
the  total  radioactivity).  Metabolism  was  the  main  elimination  pathway  of  Cabazitaxel  since  almost  no 
parent  Cabazitaxel  was  excreted  in  urine  or  feces  (<2%).  No  significant  qualitative  inter-species 
differences were noted in the metabolic profiles. All metabolites observed in human microsomes were 
also found in at least one animal species. At least seven metabolites were detected in human plasma 
but none of them (including the active metabolites RPR123142, RPR112698 and docetaxel) accounted 
individually  for  more  than  10%  on  average  of  systemic  exposure  of  parent  drug.  With  metabolism 
data,  the  monkey  and  the  dog  (followed  by  the  rabbit,  mouse  and  by  the  rat)  appeared  the  nearest 
species to human. 
Excretion 
Following a single IV administration of Cabazitaxel, the plasma clearance was high in rats (4.8 L/h/kg) 
and dogs (2.5 to 5.3 L/h/kg) and moderate in normal mice (0.9 to 1.1 L/h/kg) and in tumour bearing 
mice (1.7 L/h/kg). 
The terminal half-life was medium in dogs (3.0 to 4.3 h), long in normal mice (5.1 to 7.6 h) and in rats 
(10  h),  and  even  longer  in  tumour  bearing  mice  (26  h).  However,  in  tumour  bearing  mice  a  higher 
dose was given, allowing quantifiable levels at latter sampling times. 
Following  IV  dosing  in  mice  and  rats,  radioactivity  was  mainly  excreted  in  the  faeces  via  the  bile  (≥ 
87% of the dose) and urinary excretion was minimal (≤ 4 %). 
Following intravenous dosing [14C]-cabazitaxel to lactating rats, a small amount of  radioactivity was 
excreted into milk (between 0.23% and 1.5% of the dose). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Cabazitaxel  increased  CYP3A  enzyme  activities  in  vitro,  in  rat  hepatocytes.  In  vitro  studies  assessing 
the effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on Cabazitaxel plasmatic exposure have not been 
performed.  In  vitro  experiments  using  Human  hepatocytes  has  shown  that  cabazitaxel  is  mainly 
metabolised  by  CYP3A  (80-90%).  Interaction  prediction  with  static  or  dynamic  modeling  was  not 
performed.  However,  two  ongoing  clinical  studies,  assessing  the  effect  of  ketoconazole  (as  a  potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor) and rifampicin (as a potent CYP3A4 inducer) will provide insight into the magnitude 
of this interaction in the clinical setting. 
The in vitro study performed with a single cell model on transporters MRP1, MRP2 and BCRP, showed 
that Cabazitaxel is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of such transporters.  
However, since the model used has some limitations further investigations will be conducted to clarify 
this issue (see section 2.7). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies performed with cabazitaxel consisted of single-dose and 5-day studies in mice, rats 
and  dogs,  single-cycle  studies  (weekly  administration)  in  mice  and  dogs,  4-week  study  (daily 
administration)  in  rats,  5-cycle  study  (1  administration  every  3  weeks)  in  mice,  10-cycle  study 
(1 administration every 3 weeks) in rats and 13-cycle study (1 administration every 3 weeks) in dogs.  
During  development  of  cabazitaxel,  different  schedules  of  administration  were  tested  in  preclinical 
toxicology  studies,  such  as  5-day  administration,  weekly  administration  and  once  every  3 weeks 
administration to support the different schedules of administration that were envisaged (but were not 
necessarily  tested)  in  the  clinic.    As  the  once  every  3  weeks  schedule  of  administration  was  retained 
for  registration,  the  multiple-cycle  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were  conducted  using  this 
administration schedule.

Moreover,  as  treatment  with  microtubule  stabilising  drugs  is  often  associated  with  neurotoxicity, 
several  specific  studies  have  been  conducted  in  mice,  which  is  the  most  sensitive  species  to  assess 
neurotoxicity induced by cabazitaxel.  
Pivotal  studies  were  conducted  using  fully  characterised  batches  of  drug  substance  that  are 
representative  of  the  clinical  and/or  commercial  product  in  terms  of  impurity  content,  including 
genotoxic impurities. 
With the exception of the local tolerance in rabbits, all in vivo studies used the IV route. The duration 
of the infusions was approximately in the range of one minute to one-hour and was specified for each 
study.  The  chronic  multiple-cycle  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were  conducted  using  the  same 
duration of infusion as in clinical use (1-hour infusion).  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies presented in table 1 were conducted in mice, rats and dogs (results not 
shown). Moreover, specific neurotoxicity studies have been conducted in mice following single dose 
administration.

Neurotoxicity studies 
Treatment  with  microtubule-stabilizing  drugs  is  often  associated  with  neurotoxicity  (observed  with 
paclitaxel  and  docetaxel)  a  potentially  severe  side  effect  limiting  the  clinical  use  of  these  agents.  
Consequently,  several  studies  (determination  of  NOEL,  evolution  of  lesions  over  time,  modification  of 
duration  of infusion  time)  were  performed  in  mice, the  most  sensitive  species,  to  evaluate  peripheral 
and  central  neurotoxicity  induced  by  cabazitaxel.    Specific  pharmacokinetic  and  brain  distribution 
studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs to better understand the central neurotoxicity observed 
only in mice. 
Four single-dose neurotoxicity (peripheral and central) studies were conducted in mice with cabazitaxel 
using different durations of infusion (1-minute or 1-hour) with different necropsy time points following 
the administration (See Table 4).

Overall,  in  these  studies,  peripheral  neurotoxicity  was  characterised  by  a  non-extension  of  hindlimbs 
(when  animals  were  suspended  by  the  tail)  and  histopathologically  by  degeneration  (numerous 
ellipsoids)  of  the  sciatic  nerves  and  lumbosacral  nerve  roots.    These  histopathological  changes  were 
not  reversible  after  10  or  20  weeks  following  a  single  administration.    Considering  all  the  above 
referenced  neurotoxicity  studies,  the  lowest  NOEL  in  mice  for  peripheral  neurotoxicity  was  15  mg/kg 
(45 mg/m2)  after  single intravenous  administration  over  1  hour    and  was  considered  to  be  10  mg/kg 
(30 mg/m2) after single intravenous administration over 1 minute. 
In  addition,  central  neurotoxicity  was  characterised  histopathologically  by  neuron  necrosis  and/or 
vacuolation  in  the  brain  and  axonal  swelling  and  degeneration  in  the  cervical  spinal  cord.    Brain 
findings were not present following a 20-week observation period. 
Considering  all  the  above  referenced  neurotoxicity  studies,  the  lowest  NOEL  in  mice  for  central 
neurotoxicity was 10 mg/kg (30 mg/m2) after a single intravenous administration over 1 minute or 1 
hour.  With  a  NOEL  equal  to  10  mg/kg  (30  mg/m2)  [AUC0-168  :  10800  ng.h/mL],  safety  margin  for 
neurotoxicity finding was equal to 7.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Pivotal  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  rats  and  dogs  using  the  scheme  of 
administration used in clinical practice (administration once every 3 weeks per cycle) up to 10 and 13-
cycles respectively (see table 5 for a repeat dose toxicity programme overview).

Cabazitaxel was found to be negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test).  The effects 
observed  in  the  in-vitro  chromosome  aberration  test  (increased  number  of  polyploid  cells)  and  the 
increased  incidence  of  micronucleated  polychromatic  erythrocytes  noted  in  the  rat  bone  marrow 
micronucleus  test  were  consistent  with  the  pharmacological  activity  of  the  compound  (inhibition  of 
tubulin depolymerization).  
Carcinogenicity 
According  to  the  ICH  Topic  S9,  carcinogenicity  study  is  not  required  to  support  marketing  for 
therapeutics  intended  to  treat  patients  with  advanced  cancer,  but  cabazitaxel  can  be  considered  as  a 
carcinogenic agent due to the genotoxic properties.

on 
Cabazitaxel did not affect mating performances or fertility of male and female rats.  
Cabazitaxel induced embryo-foetal toxicity in rats, linked with maternal toxicity and consisting of foetal 
deaths  and  decreased  mean  foetal  weight  associated  with  delay  in  skeletal  ossification.  No  foetal 
abnormalities were observed in rats and rabbits. However, regarding the study performed in the rabbit, 
the choice of the high dose (0.03 mg/kg/day) was questionable given the lack of maternal toxicity at 
this dose level.   
Local Tolerance  
Following intravenous or intra-arterial administration, cabazitaxel solutions at concentrations of 1.0 or 
2.0  mg/mL  in  PS80  and  ethanol  diluted  in  5%  glucose  were  not  irritating  in  the  ears  of  male  New 
Zealand  White  rabbits.    However,  following  paravenous  administration,  cabazitaxel  solutions  showed 
microscopic  evidence  of  dermal  irritation  that  was  likely  related  to  the  vehicle  with  possible 
exacerbation  by  cabazitaxel.    These  concentrations  are  higher  than  those  expected  in  human 
therapeutic conditions (clinical concentrations range: 0.10 to 0.30 mg/mL). 
Other toxicity studies 
Mechanistic  studies  were  performed  by  the  Applicant  to  explore  the  pathogenesis  of  diarrhoea 
observed  in  dogs  investigated.  The  results  showed  that  cabazitaxel-induced  diarrhea  was  primarily 
related to a loss of mucosal barrier integrity. 
In order to qualify impurities, specific studies were performed with batches spiked with different 
impurities tested in multiple cycle toxicity in rats and dogs and in the Ames test. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  has  performed  an  ERA.  According  to  the  data  provided,  cabazitaxel  will  not  result  in  a 
significant environmental impact. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Tubulin, the protein component of microtubules, is the main target of taxanes, such as docetaxel and 
paclitaxel.  Cabazitaxel  binds  to  tubulin  and  promotes  the  assembly  of  tubulin  into  microtubules  while 
simultaneously  inhibiting  their  disassembly.  This  leads  to  the  stabilisation  of  microtubules,  which 
results in the inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Cabazitaxel was as potent as docetaxel in stabilising microtubules.  
The Applicant has provided numerous in vitro and in vivo studies investigating the antitumour activity 
of  Cabazitaxel  in  several  tumour  cell  lines  and  various  cancer  models  sensitive  or  resistant  to 
docetaxel.

Safety  pharmacology  studies  did  not  indicate  that  Cabazitaxel  had  adverse  effects  on  the  central 
nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular and gastro-intestinal systems after intravenous administration. 
Pharmacokinetics studies were performed in mice, rats and dogs.  
Cabazitaxel  increased  CYP3A  enzyme  activities  in  vitro,  in  rat  hepatocytes.  In  vitro  studies  assessing 
the effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on Cabazitaxel plasmatic exposure have not been 
performed.  In  vitro  experiments  using  Human  hepatocytes  has  shown  that  cabazitaxel  is  mainly 
metabolised  by  CYP3A  (80-90%).  Interaction  prediction  with  static  or  dynamic  modeling  was  not 
performed.  However,  two  ongoing  clinical  studies,  assessing  the  effect  of  ketoconazole  (as  a  potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor) and rifampicin (as a potent CYP3A4 inducer) will provide insight into the magnitude 
of this interaction in the clinical setting. 
Pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  are  not  sufficient  to  fully  characterise  the  PK  profile  of 
Cabazitaxel.  A  further  in  vitro  study,  using  another  cell  model,  will  be  conducted  to  clarify  whether 
Cabazitaxel is or not a MRP1, MRP2 inhibitor and a BCRP substrate/ inhibitor. 
The  results  of  the  general  toxicity  studies  show  that  the  principal  adverse  effects  of  cabazitaxel  are 
consistent  with  the  pharmacological  (antimitotic)  activity  of  a  taxane-type  antineoplastic  compound 
and resemble those reported for other taxane anticancer drugs.   
Cabazitaxel predominantly affected tissues with a high cell turnover in rats and dogs such as the bone 
marrow  (cellular  depletion),  the  liver  (hepatocellular  necrosis),  the  haematopoietic  and  lymphoid 
systems (atrophy and/or increased lymphocytolysis), the gastrointestinal tract (epithelial cell necrosis 
and/or cell degeneration/regeneration) and the male reproductive system. Most of these effects were 
reversible  and  therefore  considered  compatible  with  an  administration  every  3 weeks.  These  findings 
are  well  correlated  with  the  distribution  of  the  radioactivity  in  rats  where  high  concentrations  were 
observed in bone marrow, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems and the gastrointestinal tract. 
There were some similarities in the toxicological profile of cabazitaxel  between preclinical and clinical 
studies,  as  major  expected  effects  observed  in  clinic  are  haematological  findings  (mainly  neutropenia 
and its complications) and gastrointestinal disorders (mainly diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting)  
Due to higher sensitivity of dogs and rats to cabazitaxel compared to humans (as this is also the case 
for other marketed taxanes, docetaxel or paclitaxel), the limiting toxicity was obtained at much higher 
levels  of  exposure  in  humans  compared  to  rats  and  dogs.    Consequently,  the  calculation  of  exposure 
ratios showed that it is not possible to provide safety margins and these calculations do not provide a 
reliable indicator for the assessment of the risk in humans.  
Increased  hepatic  serum  chemistry  parameters,  arteriolar/periarterolar  necrosis  in  the  liver,  bile 
ductule hyperplasia and/or hepatocellular necrosis were observed in dogs after single-dose, 5-day and 
single-cycle  (weekly)  administration  and  in  rats  after  10-cycle  administration.    These  findings  are 
included in section 5.3 of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC). In clinical studies, transient 
increase  of  bilirubin  and  transaminases  levels  and  liver  injuries  (hepatitis  or  cholestasis  for  example) 
were occasionally observed.  
Peripheral neurotoxicity was observed in mice with single, 5-day, weekly and 5-cycle (1 infusion every 
3  weeks)  administrations  and  in  rats  with  single  and  10-cycle  administrations.    Sensory  neuropathy 
was  observed  in  clinic  with  cabazitaxel  and  it  was  already  observed  with  other  marketed  taxanes 
(docetaxel, paclitaxel). 
Central neurotoxicity was noted in mice after a single administration, after a 5-cycle administration (1 
infusion  every  3  weeks)  with  a  NOEL  of  10  mg/kg  (30  mg/m2)  or  after  a  single-cycle  administration 
(weekly) with a NOEL of 5 mg/kg (15 mg/m²)).   
Occurrence  of  central  neurotoxicity  in  mice  correlate  well  with  the  higher  blood  exposure  achieved  in 
this  species  compared  to  rats  or  dogs.  In  addition,  brain  exposures  in  mice  were  markedly  increased 
after 5 repeated administrations once every 3 weeks.  However, the brain exposure at the NOEL after 
the  5th  administration  (19 627  ng.h/g)  remained  below  the  lower  brain  exposure  value  for  which  the 
central neurotocixity was observed after single administration in mice (45 400 ng Eq.h/g). The central 
neurotoxicity was observed only in mice and not in the other species including humans. 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in rats during repeat-dose toxicity studies 
at exposure levels higher than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were

eye disorders characterised by subcapsular lens fiber swelling/degeneration. These effects were 
partially reversible after 8 weeks. 
The exposure achieved in man at the recommended therapeutic dose is equivalent to exposure in rats 
at the NOEL for microscopic findings in the lens in the 10-cycle (1 administration every three weeks) IV 
toxicity  study  in  rats  and  at  least  2-fold  lower  than  exposure  at  the  high  dose  level  that  resulted  in 
microscopic ocular findings and lethality in rats.  This effect was not observed in mice and dogs nor in 
other rat toxicity studies.  No effect on lens was reported in patients. The applicant states that in clinical 
studies,  one  patient  was  reported  to  have  cataracts,  however  the  effect  of  age  and  concurrent  use  of 
prednisone  for  the  treatment  of  prostate  cancer  in  initiating  or  aggravating  the  cataract  cannot  be 
excluded. These findings are included in the SmPC. 
Cabazitaxel  did  not  induce  mutations  in  the  bacterial  reverse  mutation  (Ames)  test.  Cabazitaxel 
increased  numerical  aberration  with  and  without  metabolic  activation  in  the  in  vitro  chromosome 
aberration  test  and  was  positive  in  the  micronucleus  test.  These  results  are  consistent  with  its 
pharmacological activity (inhibition of tubulin depolymerisation). 
Cabazitaxel induced embryofetal toxicity in rats treated intravenously once daily from gestational days 
6 through 17, linked with maternal toxicity, and consisted of foetal deaths and decreased mean foetal 
weight associated with delay in skeletal ossification. Cabazitaxel did not produce fetal abnormalities in 
rats and rabbits and did not affect mating performances or fertility of male and female rats. However, 
in  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies,  degeneration  of  seminal  vesicle  and  seminiferous  tubule  atrophy  in 
the testis were observed in rats, and testicular degeneration (minimal epithelial single cell necrosis in 
epididymis), was observed in dogs. 
In rats, cabazitaxel and its metabolites are excreted in maternal milk at a quantity up to 1.5% of 
administered dose over 24 hours.  
The  placental  transfer  of  drug-related  material  demonstrated  in  rats  validates  the  observations 
recorded  in  the  embryofetal  toxicity  studies.    It  should  be  noted  that  cabazitaxel  is  indicated  in 
hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the results of the non-clinical safety studies suggest that the principal adverse effects of 
cabazitaxel  are  consistent  with  the  pharmacological  (anti-mitotic)  activity  of  a  taxoid  –type 
antineoplastic compound and resemble those reported for other taxoid anticancer drugs. In view of its 
therapeutic indication of the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer 
previously  treated  with  a  docetaxel  containing  regimen,  it  is  considered  that  there  are  no  major 
objections or other concerns. 
Regarding  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions,  the  Applicant  is  performing  additional  study  to 
characterise the profile of the drug and possible interactions with other drugs (see 2.6). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme for the proposed indication includes the following studies: 
  Three phase I dose finding studies in patients with solid tumours (TED6188, TED6189 and TED6190) 
  One  phase  II  study  in  patients  with  taxane  and/or  anthracycline-resistant  metastatic  breast  cancer 
(ARD6191) 
  One phase III study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cabazitaxel versus mitoxantrone 
in HRPC patients previously treated with a docetaxel containing regimen (EFC6193). 
The indication applied for initially and finally approved was the following: 
Jevtana in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Results taken from the phase I study TED 6188 indicated that Cabazitaxel exhibited a high clearance 
(CL)  (mean  CL,  44.7  L/h/m²)  representing  approximately  88%  of  the  hepatic  blood  flow,  a  large 
distribution  within  the  body  (mean  Vss,  2484  L/m²)  and  a  long  terminal  half-life  (mean,  62.0h).  The 
PK  was  time  independent  up  to  3  consecutive  chemotherapy  cycles.  The  PK  analysis  showed  a  dose 
proportional  increase  in  AUC (0-48h)  over  the  dose  range  tested.  This  finding  indicated  that  the  PK  of 
XRP6258  following  a  1-hour  i.v.  infusion  is  linear  over  10-30  mg/m².  The  ex  vivo  plasma  protein 
binding was high (91.6%) and comparable to the in vitro data. Similar results could be found in study 
TED 6190. 
The descriptive statistics of the PK  parameters taken from studies TED6188, TED6190, ARD6191  and 
from the pivotal phase 3 study EFC6193 are summarised in the following table and table 12

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed and validated with data from 170 patients treated 
with  cabazitaxel  included  in  five  studies  (TED6188,  TED6189,  TED6190,  ARD6191  in  breast  cancer 
patients,  and  EFC6193  in  mHRPC  patients).  The  main  objective  of  this  analysis  was  to  develop  and 
qualify  a  PopPK  model  for  cabazitaxel  administered  in  several  studies  performed  in  patients  with 
advanced  solid  tumours  and  to  investigate  the  influence  of  key  demographic  parameters  (e.g.  body 
surface  area,  age,  etc.),  renal  function  (measured  by  creatinine  clearance)  and  hepatic  function 
(measured by bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALK), disease status (tumour type) and concomitant medication 
(CYP  inducers).  Results  indicated  that  Interindividual  variability  of  cabazitaxel  clearance  was 
significantly related to body surface area and tumour type. 
Distribution 
The Cabazitaxel pharmacokinetic profile was consistent with a 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model 
and was characterised by rapid initial and intermediate phases with population half-lives of 4.4 minutes 
and  1.6  hours,  respectively,  and  by  a  long  terminal  phase  with  a  half-life  of  95.1  hours.  Cabazitaxel 
exhibited  a  large  volume  of  distribution  (population  PK  estimate  of  4870  L,  [2640  L/m²  for  a  median 
body surface area [BSA] of 1.84 m²]).  
Protein  binding  studies  were  performed  on  human  plasma  and  on  purified  isolated  plasma  proteins 
(albumin,  lipoprotein  (high-density  lipoprotein  [HDL],  low-density  lipoprotein  [LDL],  very  low-density 
lipoprotein [VLDL]) and α1-acid glycoprotein [AAG]).The mean ex-vivo human plasma protein binding 
of  Cabazitaxel  was  91.6%,  in  agreement  with  in  vitro  data.  Cabazitaxel  showed  a  high  binding  to 
human serum albumin (82.0%) and lipoproteins (87.9% for HDL, 69.8% for LDL, and 55.8% for VLDL) 
and a low binding to α1 glycoprotein acid (17.8%). 
After  a  1-hour  IV  administration  of  [14C]-Cabazitaxel,  the  mean  value  of  the  radioactivity  blood  to 
plasma ratio at mid and end of infusion, where unchanged drug was the major component circulating 
in plasma (86%), was 1.1 (BEX6702 study).This value is in agreement with the in vitro values of the 
blood  to  plasma  ratio  for  Cabazitaxel  (mean:  0.90  and  0.99).  This  finding  indicated  that  Cabazitaxel 
was equally distributed between plasma and blood cells and confirmed that plasma was an appropriate 
matrix for monitoring the pharmacokinetics of Cabazitaxel. 
Metabolism 
In vitro data 
In vitro studies performed on human microsomal fractions indicated that Cabazitaxel was rapidly and 
extensively  metabolised  in  numerous  metabolites.  The  main  metabolic  pathways  consisting  of  (1)  O-
demethylations leading to formation of RPR123142 (10-O-demethylated derivative), RPR112698 (7-O-
demethylated derivative) and combined 7- and 10-O-demethylations (docetaxel), (2) hydroxylation on 
the tert-butyl group of the lateral chain, followed by a cyclization of the lateral chain. Combinations of 
these  metabolic  pathways  were  observed  (hydroxylated  derivative  on  the  t-butyl  moiety  of  docetaxel 
(RPR104952)  and  hydroxyoxazolidine  derivatives  of  docetaxel  (isomers  RPR111026  and  RPR111059). 
Similar biotransformation pathways, that only involved Phase 1 reactions, were observed in vivo. 
In vivo data 
Four  metabolic  pathways  have  been  identified  in  human  (study  MEH  0033).  These  metabolites  have 
previously  been  found  to  be  main  metabolites  of  docetaxel  (however,  docetaxel  itself  was  only 
detected at very low levels in plasma and faeces). 
First two O-demethylations on the taxane ring accounting together for 40% of the dose, one leading to 
RPR112698  (24%  dose)  and  the  other  leading  to  RPR123142  (16%  dose),  then  hydroxylation  on  t-
butyl moiety on the lateral chain followed by cyclisation of the lateral chain giving rise to oxazolidine-
type compounds (21% of the dose) and cleavage of the parent drug leading to the loss of the taxane 
moiety, a minor pathway only detected at low levels in plasma and urine.

Elimination 
Excretion: 
Results are mainly taken from studies BEX 6702. This study was a phase 1, open study investigating 
the disposition of 25 mg/m² [14C]-XRP6258 (50 μCi) administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion to 
patients with advanced solid tumours (BEX6702). Four patients with advanced solid tumours received 
a  single  1-hour  IV  infusion  of  [14C]-Cabazitaxel  at  25  mg/m²  (50  µCi).  Radioactivity  was  largely 
excreted  in  the  faeces  (76.0%  of  the  dose),  whereas  the  urinary  route  contributed  markedly  less 
(3.7%  of  the  dose)  over  2  weeks.  The  mean  recovery  was  79.7%  of  the  dose  within  2  weeks  with 
individual  values  ranging  from  72.6%  to  91.2%  (with  approximately  1%  of  the  dose  still  being 
excreted in faeces at the final collection). 
Study  MEH  0033  also  showed  that  following intravenous  infusion  of  [14C]-  XRP6258  at  25  mg/m²  (4 
patients with advanced solid tumours), radioactivity was mainly recovered in faeces (63 to 77% of the 
dose within 7 to 10 days) while a further 3 to 4% of the dose was excreted in urine within 4 to 5 days. 
No  unchanged  compound  was  detected  in  faeces  and  1.6-3.0%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  as  parent 
XRP6258 in urine, revealing an extensive metabolism of XRP6258 in human. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the 1-hour IV infusion every-3-weeks schedule, no major deviation to the dose proportionality was 
observed  from  10  to  30  mg/m²  and  from  10  to  25  mg/m².  In  the  weekly  schedule,  the  exposure 
increased  proportionately  with  dose  from  1.5  to  12  mg/m².  In  all  3  studies,  the  statistical  analysis 
showed  no  significant  differences  of  dose-normalized  AUC(0-48h)  or  AUC (0-t),  and  the  test  of  linearity 
applied on AUC (0-48h) at the first available cycle or on AUC  0-t at Cycle 1 Day 1 against the dose could 
not be rejected. 
Assessment  of  the  dose  proportionality  was  carried  out  on  predicted  Cmax  and  AUC  after  the  first 
administration at Cycle 1 that were estimated in the population PK analysis in the dose range of 10 to 
30 mg/m² using a power model (TED6188, TED6189, TED61890, and EFC6193). In terms of C max, no 
major deviation to the dose proportionality was observed between 10 and 30 mg/m². A 2-fold increase 
in dose (10 to 20 mg/m²) led to a 1.83-fold increase in Cmax with 90% CIs of 1.48 to 2.27 and a 3-fold 
increase in dose (10 to 30 mg/m²) led to a 2.61-fold increase in Cmax with 90% CIs of 1.85 to 3.67. 
For log-transformation of AUC, a linear trend was also observed to a certain degree. A 2-fold increase 
in  dose  (10  to  20  mg/m²)  led  to  a  1.77-fold  increase  in  AUC  with  90%  CIs  of  1.61  to  1.96.  A  3-fold 
increase in dose (10 to 30 mg/m²) led to a 2.48-fold increase in AUC with 90% CIs of 2.12 and 2.90. 
However,  the  diagnostic  figures  for  AUC  showed  some  deviations  from  the  power  model.  Thus,  the 
most  appropriate  method  to  assess  to  dose  proportionality  was  pair-wise  comparisons  of  dose  levels 
using  an  ANOVA  model.  Pair-wise  comparisons  between  the  AUC  at  10  mg/m²  versus  20  and  25 
mg/m²  (N>10  for  each  dose  level)  were  undertaken  using  a  fixed  effects  model.  A  proportional 
increase in AUC was observed between 10 and 20 mg/m² and between 10 and 25 mg/m² with a nearly 
perfect 1.95-fold increase in AUC for a 2-fold increase in dose (90% CIs: 1.62 to 2.34) between 10 and 
20 mg/m² and with a 2.45-fold increase in AUC for a 2.5-fold increase in dose (90% CIs: 2.11 to 2.84) 
between 10 and 25 mg/m². 
Special populations 
Results of the population pharmacokinetic model indicated that Interindividual variability of Cabazitaxel 
clearance was significantly related to body surface area and tumour type. 
Elderly 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis in 70 patients of 65 years and older (57 from 65 to 75 and 
13 patients above 75), no age effect on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel was observed.

Paediatric patients 
Safety and effectiveness of JEVTANA have not been established in children and adolescents below 
18 years of age. 
Hepatic impairment  
No formal studies in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. However, as cabazitaxel is 
eliminated primarily via metabolism, increased exposure may be expected. 
Renal impairment 
Cabazitaxel is minimally excreted via the kidney (2.3% of the dose). No formal pharmacokinetic 
studies were conducted with cabazitaxel in patients with renal impairment. However, the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis carried out in 170 patients that included 14 patients with moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance in the range of 30 to 50 ml/min) and 59 patients with mild renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance in the range of 50 to 80 ml/min) showed that mild to moderate renal 
impairment did not have meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Cabazitaxel is mainly metabolised by CYP3A (80% to 90%). No induction potential of cabazitaxel was 
observed in vitro with human hepatocytes in primary culture for CYP1A, CYP2C9, or CYP3A.  However, 
cabazitaxel  had  potential  to  inhibit  CYP3A  enzymes  ([I]/Ki  =  0,15),  indicating  a  possible  risk  of 
interaction with CYP3A substrate in vivo, but not with other CYPs, at the intended therapeutic dose of 
25  mg/m².  Consequently,  in  vivo  interactions  with  CYP3A-sensitive  substrates  are  possible,  but  are 
unlikely  for  the  others  CYPs.  In  vitro  studies  assessing  the  effect  of  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and 
inducers  on  cabazitaxel  plasmatic  exposure  have  not  been  performed  whereas  they  would  have 
allowed estimating the magnitude of the interaction in the absence of clinical data. 
In  addition,  at  the  dose  of  25  mg/m²,  cabazitaxel  seems  to  be  a  P-gp  substrate  but  neither  a  P-gp 
inhibitor nor a BCRP, or MRP-mediated transport inhibitor. Therefore, in vivo interactions with digoxin, 
other P-gp substrates, or BCRP or MRP substrates are not expected in vivo at the dose of 25 mg/m².  
As regards MRP1, MRP2 and BCRP, results show that cabazitaxel is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor 
of such transporters. However, this study was performed with a single cell model. Considering the low 
specificity of the model used in the study TRE0012, a second experiment with a different model will be 
performed by the applicant (see section 2.7).  
In addition, in order to further investigate the disposition of cabazitaxel and the potential for metabolic 
and  transporter-mediated  interactions with  other  drugs,  an  in  vitro  study  will  be  conducted  to  assess 
whether  cabazitaxel  is  a  potential  substrate  and/or  inhibitor  of  liver  uptake  transporters  (OATP1B3, 
OCT1 or OATP1B1) (see section 2.7). 
Other in vitro data 
The lack of cabazitaxel CYP2C9 inhibitory potency had been confirmed through a study performed with 
warfarin.  According  to  the  results  of  this  experiment,  cabazitaxel  did  not  inhibit  in  vitro  the  major 
biotransformation pathway of warfarin into 7-hydroxy-warfarin, since the inhibition never reached 50% 
at  concentrations  much  higher  than  those  observed  in  clinical  studies  (up  to  100  μmol/L  [83  600 
ng/mL]). Therefore, in vivo, warfarin hepatic metabolism should not be altered by cabazitaxel. 
Effect  of  acetaminophen,  dexamethasone,  dexchlorpheniramine,  dextropropoxyphen,  granisetron, 
methylprednisolone,  morphine,  omeprazole,  ondansetron,  ranitidine,  and  warfarin  on  cabazitaxel 
metabolism  in  human  liver  microsomes  has  been  also  assessed  since  these  drugs  are  often  co-
administered  to  the  target  population.  Results  showed  that  these  drugs  are  not  expected  to  alter 
cabazitaxel oxidation in vivo, at the therapeutic concentrations. 
In vivo 
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel 
Since cabazitaxel is mainly metabolised by CYP3A (80% to 90%), potent CYP3A inhibitors and inducers 
may  affect  its  pharmacokinetics  in  vivo.  At  the  time  of  the  dossier  cut-off  date,  no  specific  clinical 
studies  have  been  carried  out  to  assess  the  effect  of  inhibitors  or  inducers  of  CYP3A  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel.  
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010

The effect of weak CYP3A inducers (eg, prednisone/prednisolone) has been evaluated in the population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis.  Results  show  that  prednisone/prednisolone  did  not  significantly  influence 
cabazitaxel  clearance.  As  regards  prednisone/prednisolone  combination  with  cabazitaxel,  data  should 
be interpreted with caution since no usual pharmacokinetic study has been performed. 
Currently, drug interaction studies and pharmacokinetic analyses are being performed with Cabazitaxel 
and aprepitant (a moderate CYP3A inhibitor), as part of the ongoing TCD10870 study. According to the 
applicant,  the  study  is  being  amended  to  add  two  cohorts  at  the  recommended  dose  for  the 
combination  to  assess  (1)  the  effect  of  ketoconazole  (a  strong  CYP3A  inhibitor)  and  (2)  the  effect  of 
rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer).  
Effect of cabazitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs 
At time of the dossier cut-off date, no specific studies have been performed to investigate the impact 
of  cabazitaxel  on  CYP3A  sensitive  substrates.  In  vitro,  cabazitaxel  inhibits  CYP3A  with  a  constant  of 
inhibition (Ki) of 1.99 μM. Based on the Cmax value of 0.299 μM [250 ng/ml] observed in 29 patients 
treated at 25 mg/m² every 3 weeks in the Phase 3 study EFC6193, the [I]/Ki value is 0.15 for CYP3A 
and <0.1 for other tested CYPs, indicating a possible risk of interaction with CYP3A substrates in vivo. 
The risk of interaction with the other CYP isoenzymes is unlikely. 
In addition, the potential inhibitory effect of cabazitaxel on a probe CYP3A substrate (oral midazolam) 
will  be  investigated  in  a  cohort  of  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function  following  an  amendment  to 
study POP6792. (see section 2.7 and RMP). 
As  a  precautionary  measure  and  before  getting  these  key  results,  it is  stated  in  the  sections  4.5  and 
5.2 of the SmPC that potent CYP3A inductor or inhibitor could affect the concentrations of cabazitaxel. 
Also, co-administration of cabazitaxel with drugs highly metabolised through CYP3A may increase the 
exposure of these drugs. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action  
No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of action of cabazitaxel were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  Pharmacodynamic  properties  of  cabazitaxel  were  investigated  during  the  Phase  1  studies  in 
patients with solid tumours, in phase 2 study-ARD6191 in patient with metastatic breast cancer and in 
phase III study-EFC6193 in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Data from 2 
phase  1  studies  (TED6188  and  TED6190),  1  phase  2  study  (ARD6191)  and  1  phase  3 
(EFC6193/TROPIC)  study  were  combined  for  a  PK/PD  analysis  referenced  POH0258.  Doses  ranged 
from  10  to  30  mg/m².  Data  taken  from  145  patients  were  available  for  the  analysis.  The  PK/PD 
analysis  attempted  to  correlate  PK  parameters  (independent  variables)  with  both  activity  and  safety 
parameters  (dependent  variables).  Overall  survival  was  selected  as  the  pharmacological  activity 
endpoint in this PK/PD analysis. Only data from patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer were 
considered in the PK/pharmacological activity analysis since this was the target indication of interest.  
In  the  subset  of  67  hormone  refractory  prostate  cancer  patients  from  EFC6193,  none  of  the  PK 
parameters had a statistically significant association with overall survival (OS) (data not shown). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Human pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel have been investigated during the Phase 1 studies in patients 
with solid tumours, in phase 2 study-ARD6191 in patient with metastatic breast cancer and in phase 3 
study-EFC6193  in  patients  with  hormone  refractory  metastatic  prostate  cancer.  Data  from  2  phase  1 
studies  (TED6188  and  TED6190),  1  phase  2  study  (ARD6191)  and  the  pivotal  phase  3  study 
(EFC6193/TROPIC)  were  combined  for  a  PK/PD  analysis  referenced  POH0258.  There  was  no  phase  I 
study specific to prostate cancer. Pharmacokinetic data in this patient population are only taken from 
the pivotal phase 3 study. 
Doses ranged from 10 to 30 mg/m². A total of 145 patients with pharmacokinetic parameters from the 
first  cycle  were  available  for  the  analysis.  Bioanalytical  studies  were  associated  with  clinical 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010

pharmacology  studies  and  efficacy/safety  clinical  studies.  All  methods  were  found  to  be  suitable  for 
quantitative analysis of cabazitaxel and its metabolites. 
Results  taken  from  study  TED  6188  indicated  that  cabazitaxel  exhibited  a  high  CL  representing 
approximately 88% of the hepatic blood flow, a large distribution within the body and a long terminal 
half-life.  The  PK  were  time  independent  up  to  3  consecutive  chemotherapy  cycles.  The  PK  analysis 
showed  a  dose  proportional  increase  in  AUC (0-48h)  over  the  dose  range  tested.  This  finding  indicated 
that  the  PK  of  cabazitaxel  following  a  1-hour  i.v.  infusion  were  linear  over  10-30  mg/m².  Similar 
results could be found in study TED 6190. 
Cabazitaxel is extensively metabolised in the liver (>95%), mainly by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme (80% to 
90%). Cabazitaxel is the main circulating compound in human plasma. Seven metabolites were 
detected in plasma (including 3 active metabolites issued form O-demethylations), with the main one 
accounting for 5% of parent exposure. Around 20 metabolites of cabazitaxel are excreted into human 
urine and faeces.  
A population pharmacokinetic model was developed and validated with data from 170 patients treated 
with cabazitaxel included in five studies. The main objective of this analysis was to develop and qualify 
a  PopPK  model  for  cabazitaxel  administered  in  several  studies  performed  in  patients  with  advanced 
solid tumours and to investigate the influence of key demographic parameters (e.g. body surface area, 
age,  etc.),  renal  function  (measured  by  creatinine  clearance)  and  hepatic  function  (measured  by 
bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALK), disease status (tumour type) and concomitant medication (CYP inducers). 
Results  indicated  that  Interindividual  variability  of  cabazitaxel  clearance  was  significantly  related  to 
body surface area and tumour type. 
Finally, in vitro studies have shown that cabazitaxel is mainly metabolised through CYP3A and inhibits 
CYP3A. Therefore, the metabolism of cabazitaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of 
compounds which are known to be potent inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers (e.g., rifampicin, 
carbamazepine,  phenobarbital  or  phenytoin)  of  CYP3A.  Likewise  coadministration  of  cabazitaxel  with 
medicinal  products  that  are  known  to  be  primarily  metabolised  through  CYP3A  may  increase  the 
exposure  of  these  medicinal  products.  However,  there  is  no  potential  risk  of  inhibition  of  medicinal 
products that are substrates of other CYP enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C8, 2C19, 2E1, and 2D6) as well 
as  no  potential  risk  of  induction  by  cabazitaxel  on  medicinal  products  that  are  substrates  of  CYP1A, 
CYP2C9,  and  CYP3A.  Cabazitaxel  did  not  inhibit  in  vitro  the  major  biotransformation  pathway  of 
warfarin  into  7-hydroxywarfarin,  which  is  mediated  by  CYP2C9.  Therefore,  no  pharmacokinetic 
interaction of cabazitaxel on warfarin is expected in vivo. 
Cabazitaxel  is  mainly  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  and  CYP3A5  (contribution  of  CYP3A  estimated  to  range 
from 80 to 90%) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8. Cabazitaxel is also a substrate of P-gp. 
CYP3A4,  CYP3A5  and  P-gp  are  subject  to  genetic  polymorphism  however  it  is  not  expected  to  play  a 
major role in the observed variability of PK parameters of cabazitaxel. Exploratory investigations of the 
relationship between  allelic  variants  of  drug  metabolism  enzymes  or  transporters  with  PK  parameters 
(e.g., CL, Vss) of cabazitaxel will be performed by the applicant (see section 2.7). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  analysis  showed  a  dose  proportional  increase  in  AUC(0-48h)  over  the  dose  range  tested.  This 
finding  indicated  that  the  PK  of  cabazitaxel  following  a  1-hour  i.v.  infusion  were  linear  over  10-30 
mg/m². 
Results  of  a population  pharmacokinetic  model  (developed  and  validated  with  data  from  170  patients 
treated with cabazitaxel included in five studies) indicated that Interindividual variability of cabazitaxel 
clearance was significantly related to body surface area and tumour type.  
Cabazitaxel  is  mainly  metabolised  through  CYP3A  and  inhibits  CYP3A.  Therefore,  its  metabolism  may 
be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds which are known to be potent inhibitors 
or  inducers  of  CYP3A.    Likewise,  co-administration  of  cabazitaxel  with  products  metabolised  through 
CYP3A could increase the exposure of these medicinal products. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The Applicant has provided results mainly taken from one single pivotal study EFC6193 (TROPIC). Two 
supportive studies are also submitted, both performed in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients: (i) 
A phase 2 study in taxoid resistant MBC patients (study ARD6191), and (ii) A dose-escalating study in

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Two Phase 1 studies were conducted using the every 3 week schedule of administration of cabazitaxel. 
In  one  study  (TED6188)  the  dose  of  20  mg/m²  administered  every  3  weeks  as  a  1-hour  intravenous 
(IV)  infusion  was  established  as  the  recommended  dose  while  in  the  second  study  (TED6190),  25 
mg/m² administered every 3 weeks as a 1-hour IV infusion was established as the recommended dose. 
Consequently, the dose of 20 mg/m² administered every 3 weeks as a 1-hour IV infusion was selected 
initially for further clinical development. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of cabazitaxel was neutropenia 
and  its  infectious  complications  at  the  highest  dose  tested,  30  mg/m²  in  TED6188  and  25  mg/m²  in 
TED6190. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was 25 mg/m² in TED6190. 
In  a  Phase  2  study  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  patients  (Study  ARD6191),  the  safety  and  anti-
tumour activity was assessed at the dose of 20 mg/m² every 3 weeks at the first cycle, with possible 
intra-patient  escalation  to  25  mg/m2  at  Cycle  2  allowed  in  the  absence  of  any  toxicity  Grade  >2  at 
Cycle 1. In 21 patients out of 71 patients, the dose of cabazitaxel could be escalated to 25 mg/m2 IV 
after the first cycle. 
The  25  mg/m²  dose  was  chosen  for  the  main  study  (EFC  6193)  because  it  was  expected  to  provide 
optimal dose intensity and potentially increased clinical benefit. 
2.5.2.  Main study  
TROPIC Study (EFC 6193) 
The TROPIC Study was a multicenter, multi-national, randomised, open-label phase 3 study comparing 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  cabazitaxel  plus  prednisone  or  prednisolone  versus  mitoxantrone  plus 
prednisone  or  prednisolone,  in  patients  with  metastatic  HRPC  previously  treated  with  a  docetaxel-
containing regimen.

Treatments 
Randomised study medications were:  
  Cabazitaxel was administered intravenously, over 1 hour every 3 weeks, at a starting dose of 25 
mg/m². 
  Mitoxantrone was administered intravenously, over 15 to 30 minutes every 3 weeks, at a starting 
dose of 12 mg/m². 
Prednisone or prednisolone, 10 mg, was administered orally, daily, to all patients. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010 
Page 36/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study allowed for one dose reduction for toxicity (from 25 mg/m² to 20 mg/m² for cabazitaxel, 
and from 12 mg/m² to 10 mg/m² for mitoxantrone). No dose escalation is mentioned in the protocol. 
Premedication  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  included  an  antihistamine  (dexchlorpheniramine  5  mg, 
diphenhydramine 25 mg, or other antihistamine), steroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent steroid), 
and H2 antagonist (ranitidine or other H2 antagonist with the exception of cimetidine). 
Concomitant  therapy  with  agents  known  to  have  anti-cancer  activity  was  not  permitted  during  the 
treatment  phase  of  the  study.  Treatment  with  radiotherapy,  hormones,  or  chemotherapeutic  agents 
was also not permitted; with the exception of the following:  
LH-RH agonists that were ongoing prior to study entry, the steroids given for new adrenal failure, and 
the hormones administered for non-disease related conditions. 
The use of bisphosphonates was allowed. However, this dose had to be stable for 12 weeks prior to the 
enrolment and during the study treatment period. In addition, the patients who were treated with LH-
RH agonists continued their therapy during the study treatment period. 
Withdrawal, Removal and Replacement of patients 
Treatment with study medication was discontinued if it was considered to be in the best interest of the 
patient. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included: 
  Disease progression (or death due to progressive disease [PD]) ; 
  Adverse event (including death), treatment-limiting toxicity, intercurrent medical problem, that 
contra-indicate continuation of anti-cancer chemotherapy ; 
  Voluntary withdrawal ; 
  Poor compliance ; 
  Patients discontinued the study medication if they completed 10 cycles of treatment. 
Patient lost to follow-up were withdrawn from the trial. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  whether  cabazitaxel  in  combination  with 
prednisone  (prednisolone)  improves  Overall  Survival  (OS)  when  compared  to  mitoxantrone  in 
combination with prednisone (prednisolone). 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  the  progression  free  survival,  overall  response  rate  (ORR), 
PSA progression, PSA response, pain progression and pain response, as well as assess the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time interval from the date of randomisation to 
the date of death due to any cause.  
Other endpoints: 
Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  between  randomisation  and  the  date  of 
progression  (PSA  progression,  tumour  progression,  or  pain  progression)  or  date  of  death  due  to  any 
cause, whichever occurred first. 
Objective  response  (complete  and  partial  response:  CR  and  PR)  for  measurable  disease  were 
assessed by investigators according to RECIST criteria. 
Pain  Response  was  defined  as  a  2-point  or  greater  reduction  from  baseline  median  present  pain 
intensity  (PPI)  with  no  concomitant  increase  in  analgesic  score  (AS),  or  reduction  of  at  least  50%  in 
analgesic  use  from  baseline  mean  AS  (only  in  patients  with  baseline  mean  AS  ≥10)  with  no 
concomitant increase in pain, for two consecutive evaluations at least 3 weeks apart.

 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010 
Page 37/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pain  Progression was defined as an increase of ≥1 point in the median PPI from its nadir noted on 
two consecutive three-week-apart visits or 5% increase in the mean analgesic score compared with the 
baseline score and noted on two consecutive three-week-apart visits OR requirement for local palliative 
radiotherapy. 
Time  to  tumour  progression  (TTP)  was  added  as  a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  in  the  efficacy 
analyses.  It  was  defined  as  the  number  of  months  from  the  date  of  randomisation  to  evidence  of  PD 
based  upon  tumour  measurements  (RECIST  criteria).  Patients  without  PD  were  censored  at  their  last 
tumour assessment. 
Sample size 
According  to  the  following  statistical  assumptions  for  sample  size  calculation,  a  total  of  720  patients 
were to be enrolled to observe a specified number of 511 deaths: 
- 
- 
2-sided 5% alpha level 
Statistical power for overall survival: 90% 
-  Hazard ratio [M+P/(C+P)]: 1,25 
-  Median survival for the mitoxantrone + prednisone arm: 8 months 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Patient accrual: 24 months 
Follow-up period 24 months 
Time to 50% accrual: 15.6 months  
Randomisation: 1:1 [M+P:C+P] 
Randomisation 
The randomisation procedure was designed according to the 2 stratification factors: 
  Measurability of disease per RECIST criteria (measurable versus non-measurable disease), 
  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 or 1 versus 2), 
and used a dynamic allocation method. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was an open-label study. The Sponsor’s clinical team was blinded to treatment assignments.  
A  Steering  Committee  and  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  were  in  place  to  closely 
monitor  the  data  and  study  conduct.  An  external  contract  statistician  independent  from  the  Sponsor 
provided unblinded results to the IDMC. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses 
Time-to-event data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A stratified Log-rank test was used 
to compare time-to-event distributions, and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using stratified Cox 
proportional hazards models.  
Safety analysis was performed on all patients who received at least part of one dose of study drug. 
One  pre-planed  futility  analysis  (interim  analysis)  was  performed  on  the  PFS  endpoint  at  the  time  of 
225 PFS events. 
A  second  interim  analysis  “for  efficacy”  was  planned  in  an  amended  protocol  to  be  performed  on  the 
primary  endpoint  OS  at  the  time  of  307  deaths  (60%  of  the  511  deaths  expected).  Statistical 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010

significance level was consequently adjusted using the O’Brien-Fleming Type I error spending function 
(0.0076 at the second interim analysis, and 0.0476 at the final analysis). Actually, the IDMC reviewed 
the  second  interim  analysis  in  June  2009  (365  deaths);  thus,  the  statistical  significance  level  at  this 
interim analysis was 0.0160 since the analysis was done with 365 deaths instead of the  planned 307 
deaths. At the final analysis, this statistical significance level became 0.0452. 
Handling for missing data 
No  imputation  of  missing data  was  performed.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  done  to  assess  the  effect  of 
missing data (delayed or skipped visits) on efficacy endpoints. 
Subgroups analyses 
The  following  prognostic  factors  were  considered  in  the  subgroup  analyses  for  overall  survival:  ECOG 
performance  status,  disease  measurability,  number  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens,  age,  country, 
pain  at  baseline,  PSA  status,  time  from  last  docetaxel  to  randomisation,  docetaxel  dose,  and  time  of 
progression from last docetaxel. 
Additional analyses were performed in efficacy subgroups with a hazard ratio of 1. Overall survival was 
secondary analysed by baseline liver tests results, using a Cox proportional hazards model with 2 
covariates (treatment effect and liver function effect).

Recruitment 
A total of 755 patients were randomised into the study, 378 in the Cabazitaxel + prednisone group and, 
377 in the mitoxantrone + prednisone group, consistent with the planned 1:1 randomisation. Only 13 
patients,  6  (1.6%)  in  the  mitoxantrone  and  7  (1.9%)  in  the  cabazitaxel  group,  failed  to  received  a 
single  dose  of  study  drug.  Thus,  the  safety  population  was  comprised  of  742  patients  (371  in  each 
group). 
Patients were censored in both arms (98 in the cabazitaxel group, 144 in the mitoxantrone group) at 
the study cut-off aimed at reaching 511 deaths on 25 September 2009. Among them, 3 patients in the 
cabazitaxel group and 7 patients in the mitoxantrone group were lost to follow up before the study cut-
off date. 
As of the 25 September 2009 cut-off date for final analysis on OS, 232 patients (31%) completed 
follow-up, 91 (24%) in the mitoxantrone group and 141 (37%) in the Cabazitaxel group.  
The most frequent primary reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease, 180 patients 
(47.6%) in the Cabazitaxel group and 267 patients (70.8%) in the mitoxantrone group.   Treatment 
discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 32 patients (8.5%) in the mitoxantrone group 
and 67 patients (17,7%) in the cabazitaxel group. Two patients discontinued study treatment due to 
lost to follow-up (in the mitoxantrone group). 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  5  amendments  to  the  protocol,  of  which  2  were  introduced  before  the  inclusion  of  any 
patients.  Amendment  1  allowed  the  use  of  prednisolone  (10  mg  orally  daily)  in  combination  with 
cabazitaxel  or  mitoxantrone  in  those  countries  where  prednisone  was  not  commercially  available. 
Amendment 4 added an exclusion criterion to exclude patients who had not received at least 3 cycles 
or  <225  mg/m2  cumulative  dose  of  prior  docetaxel  therapy  and  modified  the  definition  of  pain 
progression  that  pain  had  to  be  cancer-related  and  pain  progression  must  have  been  supported  by 
clinical and/or radiological evidence of disease progression. Accordingly, patients were to be removed 
from study treatment for cancer-related pain progression. Amendment 5 added one interim analysis to 
be  performed  at  the  time  of  307  deaths  (the  60%  of  the  511  deaths  in  the  final  analysis  of  the 
protocol)  to  assess  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  OS  based  on  the  O’Brien-Fleming  type  I  error 
spending function. 
Major deviations to the protocol were associated with eligibility criteria (44 patients – 11.9% – in the 
mitoxantrone group and 40 patients – 10.8% – in the cabazitaxel group), or not having a 5 PPI score 
and AS at each visit (57 patients – 15.4% – in the mitoxantrone group and 49 patients – 13.2% – in 
the cabazitaxel group). 
Two  patients  (one  in  each  group)  received  the  other  treatment  than  that  allocated.  These  patients 
were evaluated for safety based on the treatment they received. Efficacy was evaluated based on the 
group to which each patient was randomised. 
Other deviations (dosing irregularities, missing values, concomitant medications) occurred in less than 
5% of patients in either group.

Results and Analysis  
Analysis description 
Primary Analysis 
Objective responses (Complete Response [CR] 
and Partial Response [PR]) for measurable 
disease as assessed by Investigators according to 
RECIST criteria. The confirmation of objective 
responses was performed by repeat tumor 
imaging (CT scans, MRI, bone scans) at least 4 
weeks after the first documentation of response. 
PSA progression (assessed in all patients): 
− In PSA non-responders, the progression was 
defined as a ≥25% increase over nadir (provided 
that the  increase in the absolute value PSA level 
was at least 5 ng/mL), confirmed by a second 
value with a ≥25% increase over baseline at least 
1 week later. 
− In PSA responders and in patients not 
evaluable for PSA response at baseline, the 
progression was defined as a ≥50% increase over 
the nadir (provided that the increase in the 
absolute value PSA level was at least 5 ng/mL), 
confirmed by a second value at least 1 week 
later. 
PSA response (assessed only in patients with 
baseline PSA ≥20 ng/mL): Response required a 
PSA decrease of ≥50% confirmed by a second 
PSA value at least 3 weeks later. The duration of 
PSA response was measured from baseline to the 
last assessment at which the above criteria are 
satisfied.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has mainly provided results taken from one single pivotal study (TROPIC Study).. 
The TROPIC study was a multicenter, multinational, randomised, open-label phase 3 study comparing 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  cabazitaxel  plus  prednisone  (or  prednisolone)  versus  mitoxantrone  plus 
prednisone  (or  prednisolone),  in  patients  with  mHRPC  previously  treated  with  a  docetaxel-containing 
regimen.  
Mitoxantrone was chosen as an active comparator. There is no consensus/approved drugs/combination 
therapies in second line mHRPC. This choice is however considered as acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  pivotal  study  was  to  determine  whether  cabazitaxel  in  combination  with 
prednisone  could  improve  overall  survival  when  compared  to  mitoxantrone  in  combination  with 
prednisone.  Secondary  objectives  notably  included  progression  free  survival,  overall  response  rate, 
PSA progression, PSA response, pain progression or pain response. 
All baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the treatment groups. 
The  pivotal  study  met  both  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  with  the  exception  of  pain  response.  A 
statistically significant difference was observed in favour of cabazitaxel as compared to mitoxantrone in 
terms  of  OS,  with  a  2.4  months  increase  of  median  OS,  and  a  30%  reduction  in  risk  of  death 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010 
Page 51/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(HR=0.70).  The  effect  of  cabazitaxel  was  consistent  across  the  majority  of  subgroups,  even  if  not 
significant in all of them. 
However, in subgroup analyses (i) there was no statistically significant difference between cabazitaxel 
and mitoxantrone in patients who have received 3 cycles or less (225 mg/m²) of docetaxel, and (ii) the 
effect of cabazitaxel was less pronounced in patients who received two lines of docetaxel.  
The  data  to  support  the  selected  posology  in  EFC6193  came  from  a  very  limited  number  of  patients 
and  there  are  still  uncertainties  regarding  the  rationale  for  the  selected  dose.  A  phase  3  study 
(EFC11785) is under preparation with the primary objective to demonstrate the non inferiority in term 
of  overall  survival  (OS)  of  cabazitaxel  20  mg/m²  (Arm  A)  versus  cabazitaxel  25  mg/m²  (Arm  B)  in 
combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated  with  docetaxel.  Approximately  1200  patients  are  planned  to  be  enrolled.  The  applicant  will 
submit the results of this study as reflected in section 2.7.   
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  conclusion,  the  efficacy  of  cabazitaxel  in  combination  with  prednisone  or  prednisolone  for  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  mHRPC  previously  treated  with  a  docetaxel  containing  regimen  has  been 
established.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Seven  clinical  studies  (one  pivotal  and  6  supportive)  including  591  patients  treated  with  cabazitaxel 
were analysed for safety: 
 
 
 
with capecitabine, 
 
four phase 1 studies (TED6188, TED6189, TED6190, and BEX6702) in solid tumours, 
one phase 2 study (ARD6191) in metastatic breast cancer, 
one phase 2 combination therapy study (TCD6945) in metastatic breast cancer, in combination 
one phase 3, pivotal study (EFC6193) in hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). 
.  Studies  TED6188,  TED6189,  and  TED6190  were  dose-finding  phase  1  studies  in  patients  with 
advanced solid tumours. In addition, eight patients in phase 1 programme had a diagnosis of prostate 
cancer. Only one phase 3 pivotal study (EFC6193) was conducted in the requested indication. 
Different  doses  of  cabazitaxel  from  10  to  30  mg/m²  every  3  weeks  or  from  1,5  to  12  mg/m²  one 
weekly were investigated in 99 patients in phase 1 studies.  
Study  BEX6702  was  an  open  study  investigating  the  disposition  of  [14C]-Cabazitaxel  at  25  mg/m² 
administered  as  a  1-hour  infusion  every  3  weeks  to  4  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours.  Study 
ARD6191  was  a  phase  2  dose-escalation  study  in  patients  with  taxoid-resistant  metastatic  breast 
cancer  that  also  compared  the  effects  of  cabazitaxel  (84  patients)  and  larotaxel  (12  patients).  Study 
TCD6945  was  a  phase  2  dose-escalation  (Part  1)  and  efficacy  (Part  2)  study  of  Cabazitaxel  20  or  25 
mg/m² in combination with capecitabine (825 mg/m² and 1000 mg/m² twice daily) in 33 patients with 
metastatic  breast  cancer.  Study  EFC6193  was  a  pivotal,  phase  3,  open-label  study  in  patients  with 
metastatic HRPC, comparing 25 mg/m² of cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 
in 371 patients and mitoxantrone in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in also 371 patients. 
Two studies are ongoing:  
 
malignancies, 
 
study TCD10870, in combination with cisplatin.  
study TCD11068, in combination with gemcitabine administered in patients with advanced solid 
Patient exposure 
Overall,  during  the  development  program,  a  total  of  591  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
Cabazitaxel in 7 clinical studies were included in the safety analysis. Among them, 371 male subjects 
have  been  exposed  to  Cabazitaxel  at  the  recommended  dose  of  25  mg/m²  in  combination  with 
prednisone  or  prednisolone  every  3  weeks  for  the  current  MAA  (see  table  24).  Different  doses  and 
different regimens have been studied during the development programme. Weekly administration was 
more harmful for treated patients than the drug administration every 3 weeks.

The  dose  of  20  mg/m²  was  firstly  studied  as  the  appropriate  dose  but  the  dose  of  25  mg/m²  was 
chosen  for  the  phase  3  pivotal  study  because  it  was  expected  to  provide  optimal  dose  intensity  and 
potentially  increased  clinical  benefit.  All  patients  had  a  primary  tumour  diagnosis  of  HRPC  previously 
treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen. The demographic characteristics of age, race, measurable 
disease and extent of disease, were similar in the treatment groups. Median age was 67 and 68 years 
old for mitoxantrone and cabazitaxel, respectively.  
However, the following differences have been identified and further clarified by the applicant: 
More  patients  were  65  to  74  years  old  in  cabazitaxel  arm  (46.6%  vs.  38.5%  in  mitoxantrone 
 
arm). An analysis of age and treatment effect by the logistic model showed an age effect on adverse 
events  in  the  2  treatment  groups  and  no  interaction  between  age  and  treatment  suggesting  that  the 
observed  differences  in  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  between  the  younger  and  the 
elderly patients were similar in patients receiving cabazitaxel compared with mitoxantrone. 
Regarding ECOG performance, slightly more patients has an ECOG 0 in cabazitaxel group (37% 
 
vs. 31%). ECOG 0 patients might be expected to have better outcomes. The majority of patients were 
ECOG 1, however, with slightly more in the comparator group. These patients are good candidates for 
treatment,  as  well.  More  than  90%  of  patients  in  each  group  were  included  in  the  ECOG  PS  0-1 
stratification; 
With  regard  to  the  docetaxel-containing  regimens  prior  to  the  trial  (ITT  population),  the 
 
median  total  prior  docetaxel  dose  is  higher  in  cabazitaxel  arm  (576.6  mg/m²)  compared  to 
mitoxantrone  arm  (529.2  mg/m²).  It  is  unclear  what  effect  this  difference  had  .A  greater  (median) 
dose  of  docetaxel  might  represent  a  patient  who  responded  to  taxanes  for  a  longer  period.  On  the 
other  hand,  it  might  have  also  put  the  study  participant  at  risk,  particularly  for  bone  marrow 
suppression;

The  PSA  level  was  more  increased  in  cabazitaxel  group  (143.9  ng/mL)  in  comparison  to  MTX 
 
group  (127.5  ng/mL).  However  the  difference  is  small  and  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  or  prediction 
made; 
Concerning  pre-treatment,  concomitant  medications  with  corticosteroids  (dexamethasone), 
 
antihistamines,  and  H2  antagonists  were  required  by  protocol  for  premedication  only  in  cabazitaxel 
group,  the  determining  factor  to  this  difference  is  the  patient  safety  and  previous  experience  with 
taxanes;  antibacterials,  immunostimulants,  antidiarrheals,  blood  substitutes  and  perfusion  solutions 
were used significantly more frequently in patients of cabazitaxel group compared to the comparative 
group. This reflects the greater number of adverse events (AEs) and their treatment in the cabazitaxel 
group.  Furthermore,  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  disease  progression,  not 
adverse events;  
Patients in the cabazitaxel group received a median of 6 cycles of treatment (range: 1 to 10), 
 
with  a  median  relative  dose  intensity  (RDI)  of  96.12%,  and  patients  in  the  mitoxantrone  group 
received a median of 4 cycles of treatment (range: 1 to 10) with a median RDI of 97.25% suggesting 
that the planned doses were achieved in both arms. Only 13,5% of patients received a maximum of 10 
cycles  in  comparative  arm  while  they  were  29,4%  who  received  10  cycles  of  cabazitaxel  treatment. 
The  total  number  of  cycles  administered  was  increased  in  cabazitaxel  group  (2251)  in  comparison  to 
mitoxantrone group (1736). 
Adverse events  
In  EFC6193  pivotal  study,  treatment-emergent  AEs  (regardless  of  relationship  to  study  treatment) 
occurred  in  95.7%  of  patients  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  and  88.4%  of  patients  in  the  mitoxantrone 
group. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 57.4% of patients in the cabazitaxel group and 39.4% of patients 
in the mitoxantrone group (see table 25).

The  most  frequent  TEAEs  in  EFC6193  study  among  patients  treated  with  cabazitaxel,  were  diarrhoea 
(46.6%),  fatigue  (36.7%),  nausea  (34.2%),  vomiting  (22.6%),  and  neutropenia  (21.8%).  All  these 
TEAEs were significantly more important in cabazitaxel arm compared to mitoxantrone arm (diarrhoea 
10.5%, fatigue 27.5%, nausea 22,9%, vomiting 10,2%, and neutropenia 10,8%). Febrile neutropenia 
occurred in 7.5% patients treated with Cabazitaxel and in only 1.5% patients with mitoxantrone. 
Grade  ≥3  TEAEs  reported  in  at  least  3%  of  patients  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  were  neutropenia 
(21.3%),  febrile  neutropenia  (7.5%),  diarrhoea  (6.2%),  fatigue  (4.9%),  asthenia  (4.6%),  back  pain 
(3.8%), leucopoenia (3.8%), and anaemia (3.5%).  
In the Phase 1/Phase 2 studies, the percentage of patients with TEAEs ≥Grade 3 ranged from 49.4% 
to  61.8%.  TEAEs  that  were  more  increased  in  these  studies  compared  to  the  pivotal  study  were 
peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  weight  decreased,  headache,  pyrexia,  dyspnoea,  myalgia  and 
stomatitis. Asthenia was observed in more than half patients when cabazitaxel was administered once 
weekly.  Alopecia  was  observed  in  more  than  30%  of  patients  treated  by  ≥25  mg/m²  cabazitaxel. 
Hypersensitivity or injection site reactions were observed in 4.5% of patients.

neuropathy,  muscle  spasms,  urinary  tract  infection,  hypotension,  mucosal  inflammation,  and 
thrombocytopenia.  In  addition,  when  peripheral  neuropathy  is  considered,  patient  with  worst  grade 
HLT  peripheral  neuropathy  (which  includes  sensitive,  motor  and  peripheral)  is  13.5%  in  the 
Cabazitaxel arm compared to 3.2 % in mitoxantrone arm. However, the majority of these events were 
Grade 1 and 2. 
Haematological toxicity: 
Twice  as  much  anaemias,  thrombocytopenias  and  neutropenia  have  been  reported  during  the  pivotal 
study  in  cabazitaxel  arm  (10.8%,  5.4%  and  28%)  in  comparison  to  mitoxantrone  arm  (5.4%,  2.7% 
and  11.9%).  Grade  ≥3  neutropenia  was  even  thrice  as  much  with  cabazitaxel  compared  to 
mitoxantrone treatment (27.5% vs. 8.4%). There were notably more febrile neutropenia in Cabazitaxel 
group (7.5% vs. 1.3%).  Nine patients (2.4%) discontinued the cabazitaxel treatment due to Grade ≥3 
neutropenia  and  3  patients  more  due  to  febrile  neutropenia  in  the  pivotal  study  compared  to  zero 
patient in comparative arm. In addition, infections were more frequent in the cabazitaxel-treated arm 
compared  to  mitoxantrone  arm  (34%  vs.  22.6%)  with  twofold  more  grade  ≥3  TEAEs  (10.2%  vs. 
5.1%).  Anaemia  (based  on  hemoglobin  laboratory  values)  was  observed  in  the  vast  majority  of 
patients in both the cabazitaxel (97.0%) and the mitoxantrone groups (81.4%) in Study EFC6193. The 
incidence of Grade ≥ 3 anaemia was higher with cabazitaxel (10.5%) than with mitoxantrone (4.9%).

Nervous system disorders 
Nervous  system  disorders  were  significantly  more  common  in  Cabazitaxel  group  compared  to 
mitoxantrone  arm.  Peripheral  neuropathies  were  of  higher  rate  in  Cabazitaxel  arm  (13.5%  vs  3.2% 
mitoxantrone). In the pivotal study, there were 18 patients with HLT paresthesia and dysesthesia, and 
50 patients with HLT peripheral neuropathy treated with cabazitaxel presented an event of peripheral 
neuropathy  or  paraesthesias  and  dysaesthesias.  A  review  of  these  cases  shows  in  general,  grades  1 
and  2  events  without  any  action  taken,  except  few  delayed  and  reduced  doses.  Two  patients  with 
grade >3 peripheral neuropathy were 74 and 80 year-old. 
In phase 1/phase 2 studies, peripheral sensory neuropathy is reported in almost one-third of patients. 
Cardiac disorders 
All Grade events among cardiac disorders were more common on cabazitaxel of which 6 patients 
(1.6%) had Grade ≥3 cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of tachycardia on cabazitaxel was 1.6%, 
none of which were Grade ≥3. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 1.1% in the cabazitaxel group. 
Cardiac failure events were more common on cabazitaxel, the event term being reported for 2 patients 
(0.5%). One patient in the cabazitaxel group died from cardiac failure. Fatal ventricular fibrillation was 
reported in 1 patient (0.3%), and cardiac arrest in 2 patients (0.5%). None were considered related by 
the investigator.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The  percentage  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  is  significantly  more  important  in  the  cabazitaxel  groups 
when  compared  to  mitoxantrone  administration  (73.3%  vs.  48%).  All  treatment-emergent  AEs  and 
grade ≥3 are significantly more common in cabazitaxel arm: in particular, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal vascular conditions.  Some AE were even more pronounced 
in phase 1/ phase 2 studies in the group with ≥25 mg/m² cabazitaxel: abdominal pain 32.6%, nausea 
and vomiting 55.8%, stomatitis 16.3%. 
Skin and subcutaneous disorders 
Skin and subcutaneous disorders were more observed in cabazitaxel group compared to mitoxantrone 
group  during  the  pivotal  trial  (21.8%  cabazitaxel  group  16.4%  mitoxantrone  group).  Twice  as  many 
patients  suffered  from  alopecia  in  cabazitaxel  group  compared  to  mitoxantrone  (10.0%  cabazitaxel 
group, 4.9% mitoxantrone group). Alopecia was particularly observed in patients (30.2%) treated with 
high dose of cabazitaxel (≥25 mg/m²) that include the dose proposed for studied indication.  
Renal and urinary disorders 
Significantly  higher  incidence  of  renal  failure  and  acute  renal  adverse  events  is  reported  in  patients 
treated  by  Cabazitaxel  compared  to  those  treated  by  mitoxantrone  (30.7%  Cabazitaxel,  11.3% 
mitoxantrone), however urinary tract signs and symptoms were the predominant reasons. The trend of 
high frequency of renal and urinary disorders was also confirmed during phase 1/phase 2 studies. 
Hematuria is very common in patients with prostate cancer, yet was more frequent in the cabazitaxel 
group  (62  patients  [16.7%]  all  grades,  7  patients  [1.9%]  Grade ≥3)  than  in  the  mitoxantrone  group 
(14 patients [3.8%] all grades, 2 patients [0.5%] Grade ≥3). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events: 
In  study  EFC6193,  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  39.1%  of  patients  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  and 
20.8%  of  patients  in  the  mitoxantrone  group.  The  most  common  Grade  ≥3  serious  adverse  events 
(SAEs) (≥1%) in the cabazitaxel group were febrile neutropenia (6.7%), neutropenia (4.9%), diarrhea 
(1.9%), pneumonia (1.3%), and renal failure acute (1.1%). The most common Grade ≥3 SAEs in the 
mitoxantrone  group  were  disease  progression  (3.0%)  and  febrile  neutropenia  (1.1%).  The  pattern  of 
SAEs is similar to that of AEs in general, with hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity among the most 
prominent. SAEs also included events attributable to the consequences of these, notably infection and 
renal failure. 
Deaths: 
In  study  EFC6193,  the  percentage  of  patients  who  died  from  TEAEs  (other  than  progressive  disease) 
within  30  days  of  last  infusion  was  4.9%  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  compared  with  1.9%  in  the 
mitoxantrone group. Of the 18 patients who died in the cabazitaxel group, 7 of these were attributed 
to neutropenia and its consequences: neutropenic sepsis (2); fungal sepsis; sepsis; septic shock (with 
associated enterocolitis and renal failure); pancytopenia; and, a case of vomiting and aspiration in the 
setting of neutropenia. Six (6) of these were considered related to study treatment.  
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/782336/2010 
Page 57/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  were  5  deaths  due  to  cardiac  events:  cardiac  arrest  (2);  cardiac  failure;  dyspnoea;  and, 
ventricular  fibrillation.  Three  fatal  cases  of  renal  failure  were  reported:  renal  failure  (2);  and,  renal 
failure and respiratory failure. One (1) case of electrolyte imbalance (in the setting of diarrhoea after 
home treatment for constipation) was included among the fatal cases. There were two “other” cases: 
cerebral haemorrhage (intracranial haemorrhage after a fall); and, a sudden death (at home). 
Data from Phase 1/2 studies: 
In  the  Phase  1/Phase  2  studies,  the  number  of  TEAEs,  serious  TEAEs,  the  number  of  patients 
withdrawing  from  study  treatment,  and  deaths  within  30  days  of  last  infusion  of  study  drug  were 
mostly  similar  to  those  reported  in  the  Phase  3  study  EFC6193.  The  main  haematological  AE  was 
neutropenia, occurring in more than 90% of patients with the majority of patients experiencing at least 
grade  3  neutropenia.  Gastrointestinal  disorders  including  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting  and  anorexia 
were also of very frequent rate. 
The  number  of  patients  who  died  was  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  Phase  3  study  EFC6193  (<25 
mg/m²  cabazitaxel:  80.9%;  ≥25  mg/m²  cabazitaxel:  60.5%;  weekly  cabazitaxel:  61.8%).  The 
majority of deaths were due to disease progression. One death in study TED6188 (30 mg/m²) was due 
to neutropenic (pulmonary) infection; 1 death in study ARD6191 (20 mg/m²) was due to cyanosis and 
dyspnoea  (from  multiple  causes);  and  one  for  unknown  reasons  (possibly  a  sudden  cardiac  death). 
One (1) patient in study TED6189 who was given cabazitaxel at the highest weekly dose (12 mg/m²) 
died due to pneumonia that occurred 21 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  31.5%,  37.2%,  and  45.5%  of  patients  in  each  of  the  3  treatment 
groups  (<25  mg/m²  cabazitaxel, ≥25 mg/m²  cabazitaxel,  and weekly  cabazitaxel).  The proportion  of 
patients withdrawing from study treatment due to any TEAE (including disease progression reported as 
a TEAE) was 3.4%, 9.3%, and 16.4% in each of the 3 treatment groups. 
Laboratory findings 
In the Phase 3 study EFC6193,  patients treated with cabazitaxel experienced more myelosuppression 
resulting in a higher incidence of neutropenia and anaemia. Especially, grade ≥3 neutropenia was high 
(81.7%) in patients in the cabazitaxel group compared with those in the mitoxantrone group (58.1%). 
Thrombocytopenia was reported slightly more frequently with the reference product. 
Slight differences were observed in liver and renal function chemistry results between cabazitaxel and 
mitoxantrone treated arms. No hepatobiliary disorders were observed during the studies with 
cabazitaxel. The incidence of grade ≥3 anaemia, increased AST, ALT, and bilirubin based on laboratory 
abnormalities were 10.6%, 0.7%, 0.9%, and 0.6%, respectively. Four cases of renal failure have been 
reported in cabazitaxel group and none in mitoxantrone group. 
Safety in special populations 
Renal insufficiency: 
The  safety  of  Cabazitaxel  has  not  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  renal  disorders.  However,  cases  of 
renal failure including cases with fatal outcome have been reported. 
In the proposed SmPC, it is stated that no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal 
impairment, that patients with moderate and severe renal impairment should be treated with caution 
and monitored carefully during treatment and that dosage delay or reduction should be considered in 
the event of adverse drug reactions. The applicant has been requested to further investigate the PK in 
patients  with  moderate  and  severe  renal impairment  as  part  of  study  POP12251  reflected  in  the  RMP 
(see 2.6) 
Hepatic insufficiency: 
The  safety  of  cabazitaxel  has  not  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  dysfunction. 
Cabazitaxel is therefore contra-indicated in patients with hepatic impairment defined as bilirubin ≥1 x 
ULN, or AST and/or ALT ≥1,5 x ULN, as listed in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
In  order  to  recommend  appropriate  dose  modifications  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  the 
applicant is currently conducting a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetic study (POP6792) of cabazitaxel 
in advanced solid tumour patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. The study is designed 
as an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study (see 2.7).

Paediatric population: 
The safety of Cabazitaxel therapy has not been established in children aged 0 to 18 years of age and a 
statement has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Elderly patients: 
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabazitaxel in elderly patients is recommended. 
Among  the  371  patients  treated  with  cabazitaxel  in  the  prostate  cancer  phase  3  study,  240  patients 
were 65 years or over including 70 patients older than 75 years  
The  following  adverse  reactions  reported  at  rates  5%  higher  in  patients  65  years  of  age  or  greater 
compared  to  younger  patients:  fatigue  (40.4%  versus  29.8%),  neutropenia  (24.2%  versus  17.6%), 
asthenia  (23.8%  versus  14.5%),  pyrexia  (14.6%  versus  7.6%),  dizziness  (10.0%  versus  4.6%), 
urinary tract infection (9.6% versus 3.1%) and dehydration (6.7% versus 1.5%), respectively. 
The  incidence  of  the  following  grade  ≥3  adverse  reactions  were  higher  in  patients  65  years  of  age 
compared to younger patients; neutropenia based on laboratory abnormalities (86.3% versus 73.3%), 
clinical neutropenia (23.8% versus 16.8%) and febrile neutropenia (8.3% versus 6.1%). 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation: 
There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women with cabazitaxel. 
Studies  in  animals  have  shown  the  reproductive  toxicity  and  that  cabazitaxel  crosses  the  placenta 
barrier. cabazitaxel administered once daily to female rats from gestational days 6 to 17 at a dose of 
0.16  mg/kg/day  (approximately  one-tenth  to  one-twentieth  the  area  under  the  concentration  curve 
(AUC)  in  cancer  patients  at  the  recommended  human  dose)  caused  embryofetal  toxicity,  due  to 
maternal toxicity consisting of foetal deaths and decreased mean foetal weight associated with a delay 
in skeletal ossification. Cabazitaxel did not produce foetal abnormalities in rats and rabbits.  
Available pharmacokinetics data in animals have shown excretion of cabazitaxel and its metabolites in 
milk.  A  risk  to  the  suckling  child  cannot  be  excluded  and  appropriate  recommendations  have  been 
included in section 4.6 of the RMP. 
Considering  the  pharmacological  activity  of  taxanes,  their  genotoxic  potential  and  effect  of  several 
compounds of this class on fertility in animal studies, effect on male fertility could not be excluded in 
human.  
Due to potential effects on male gametes and to potential exposure via seminal, and the lack of data 
from  the  use  of  cabazitaxel  in  pregnant  women,  it  is  stated  in  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  that  men 
treated with cabazitaxel should use effective contraception during the treatment and continue for up to 
6  months  after  the  last  dose  of  cabazitaxel.  Also  Due  to  potential  exposure  via  seminal  liquid,  men 
treated  with  cabazitaxel  should  prevent  contact  with  the  ejaculate  by  another  person  throughout 
treatment.  
Immunological events 
In the pivotal study, immune system disorders (all grades) were observed in 8 patients (2.2% ) in the 
cabazitaxel  group  and  0.8%  of  patients  in  the  mitoxantrone  group.  These  were  primarily 
hypersensitivity  disorders,  which  occurred  in  5  patients  (1.3%),  treated  with  cabazitaxel  and  no 
patients  treated  with  mitoxantrone.  All  hypersensitivity  events  were  Grade  1  or  2.  Three  of  these  5 
patients in the Cabazitaxel group had a hypersensitivity reaction that resulted in a dose interruption. 
Ten cases of hypersensitivity have been reported in the Phase 1/Phase 2 studies; five were Grade ≥3. 
Three  of  these  events,  one  anaphylactic  reaction  and  two  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  considered 
serious. 
Allergic  conditions  and  hypersensitivity  to  cabazitaxel,  to  other  taxanes  therapy  or  any  excipients  of 
the  formulation  including  Polysorbate  80  are  contra-indicated  for  the  use  of  this  product.  In  addition, 
hypersensitivity reactions should be closely monitored. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
At the time of the dossier cut-off date, no specific studies have been carried out to assess the effect of 
inhibitors  or  inducers  of  CYP3A  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Cabazitaxel.  The  effect  of  weak  CYP3A 
inducers (eg. prednisone or prednisolone) has been evaluated in the population PK analysis. No specific 
studies have been performed to investigate the impact of Cabazitaxel on CYP3A sensitive substrates.  
No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been completed with Cabazitaxel. 
immunocompromised  by 
Administration  of 
chemotherapeutic  agents,  may  result  in  serious  or  fatal  infections.  The  concomitant  vaccination  with 
yellow fever vaccine was contraindicated and appropriate recommendations regarding vaccination have 
been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
More patients discontinued the study due to disease progression in the mitoxantrone group compared 
to  cabazitaxel  group,  72.2%  vs.  48.2%.  However  the  number  of  discontinuations  due  to  TEAES  was 
approximately  2-fold  higher  in  the  cabazitaxel-treated  group  compared  to  the  mitoxantrone-treated 
group (cabazitaxel: 18.3% versus mitoxantrone: 8.4%). The number of discontinuation was very high 
in  the  phase  1  and  2  trials,  only  7.9%,  7%  and  1.8%  patients  completed  the  study.  In  TCD6945 
combination study, not any patient completed the study treatment period. 
Nine  patients  (2.4%)  discontinued  the  cabazitaxel  treatment  due  to  Grade  ≥3  neutropenia  and  3 
patients more due to febrile neutropenia in the pivotal study compared to zero patient in mitoxantrone 
arm.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  clinical  development  programme  of  cabazitaxel  included  591  subjects  who  received  at  least  one 
dose of cabazitaxel, regardless of the dosage and treatment duration. 
Clinical safety analysis is based on 4 phase 1, two phase 2 and one phase 3 studies. Only one phase 3 
pivotal,  comparative  study  with  742  patients  involved  was  conducted  in  the  requested  indication  in 
combination  with  prednisone  or  prednisolone  for  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  hormone 
refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) previously treated with docetaxel-based treatment.  
415 patients have been treated with a proposed dose range of 25 mg/m² of cabazitaxel, including 371 
patients involved in the phase 3 trial and 44 patients involved in the phase 1 and phase 2 studies. Two 
studies  were  carried  out  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer,  previously  treated  by  taxane 
therapy. 
Different  doses  and  different  regimens  have  been  studied  during  this  development  programme.  The 
dose levels of 20 mg/m2 and 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks were defined as the recommended doses for 
further  clinical  development.  The  higher  dose  of  25  mg/m²  of  Cabazitaxel  every  three  weeks  was 
chosen  for  phase  3  pivotal  study  although  fewer  patients  were  studied  with  a  dose  of  25  mg/m²  of 
Cabazitaxel in the phase 1 and 2 trials. Safety profile of this higher dose seems to be less satisfactory. 
Concerning the regional distribution, the majority of patients were studied in Europe. 
The  total  number  of  cycles  administered  was  higher  in  cabazitaxel  group  (2251)  in  comparison  to 
mitoxantrone  group  (1736).  It  appears  that  the  major  effect  of  the  administration  of  more  cycles 
among cabazitaxel treated patients is the likelihood of a greater number of TEAEs reported. However 
controlled for cycles, there were more AEs in the cabazitaxel group. 
Overall,  treatment-emergent  AE  were  reported  in  higher  incidence  in  the  cabazitaxel  group,  in 
particular,  grade  ≥  3  TEAE.  A  risk  ratio  of  ≥2  between  the  cabazitaxel  and  mitoxantrone  treatment 
groups, confirming more than twofold risk with the use of cabazitaxel when compared to mitoxantrone, 
was determined for the following AEs: peripheral neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, dysuria, hematuria, 
diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  dysgeusia,  dyspnea,  vomiting,  anemia,  alopecia,  neutropenia,  dyspepsia, 
peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  muscle  spasms,  urinary  tract  infection,  hypotension,  mucosal 
inflammation, and thrombocytopenia.  
The  number  of  patients  with  any  TEAE,  serious  TEAE,  grade  ≥3  TEAE,  and  withdrawals  due  to  any 
TEAE was significantly higher in cabazitaxel group compared to mitoxantrone group of patients.  
The  SOCs  reporting  a  statistically  significant  higher  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  cabazitaxel  arm  were: 
Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders,  Infections  and  Infestations, 
Nervous  System  Disorders,  also  observed  with  other  taxane  therapies.  In  addition,  a  statistically 
significant higher rate of AEs was reported in cabazitaxel-treated subjects compared with mitoxantrone 
treated subjects for General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions, Renal And Urinary Disorders, 
Respiratory, Thoracic And Mediastinal Disorders, Metabolism And Nutrition Disorders. 
Overall, the proportion of patients experiencing at least one SAE in the safety population of the phase 
3 study was of higher rate in the cabazitaxel arm compared to mitoxantrone arm. Even two-fold higher 
number  of  patients  treated  by  cabazitaxel  experienced  serious  AEs  and  grade ≥3  SAEs.  In  the  phase 
1/phase 2 studies, a rate of serious AEs was similar to that of phase 3 study.  
In  the  pivotal  study,  grade  ≥3  neutropenia  was  thrice  as  much  with  cabazitaxel  compared  to 
mitoxantrone  treatment.  Even  if  the  management  of  these  cases  and  the  use  of  prophylactic  or 
CHMP assessment report

therapeutic  G-CSF  are  recommended  according  to  ASCO  Guideline,  the  high  rate  of  neutropenia 
leading to infections and sepsis remains an issue for the use of cabazitaxel.  
A  dose  modification  has  been  included  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  in  patients  presenting  grade  ≥3 
neutropenia longer than one week despite appropriate treatment including G-CSF. A warning was also 
included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  describing  the  risk  of  neutropenia  and  providing  guidance  on  its 
management. Furthermore, cabazitaxel is contraindicated in patients with neutrophil counts less than 
1,500/mm3. 
The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 anaemia was twice as higher in patients treated with cabazitaxel than with 
mitoxantrone.  Appropriate  recommendations  have  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  for 
patients with haemoglobin <10g/dL. 
Cases  of  peripheral  neuropathy,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (e.g.,  paraesthesias,  dysaesthesias) 
and peripheral motor neuropathy have been observed in patients receiving cabazitaxel. Patients under 
treatment  with  cabazitaxel  will  be  advised  to  inform  their  doctor  prior  to  continuing  treatment  if 
symptoms of neuropathy such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness, or weakness develop. Physicians 
will  be  recommended  to  assess  for  the  presence  or  worsening  of  neuropathy  before  each  treatment. 
The treatment with cabazitaxel should be delayed until improvement of symptoms. The dose should be 
reduced from 25 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2 for persistent grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy. 
Peripheral  neuropathy  has  been  considered  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  RMP  and  information  was 
included in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. Peripheral neuropathy should be closely monitored 
in post-marketing setting. 
A  higher  incidence  of  cardiac  arrhythmia  was  observed  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  compared  to  the 
control  group.  The  Applicant  states  that  no  potential  risk  factors  could  be  readily  identified  and  that 
there is a lack of clear evidence to suggest that cabazitaxel contributed to these cardiac events. It is 
therefore difficult to confirm whether cardiac disorders, in particular arrhythmias, could be identified as 
a potential or confirmed risk after cabazitaxel administration. The Applicant is evaluating the effect of 
cabazitaxel on QT/Qc interval in cancer patients in study TES10884, which has been designed to meet 
the current ICH E14 guidance (see section 2.7).  
In  light  of  the  unknown  aetiology  of  the  increased  incidence  of  cardiac  deaths  and  arrhythmias,  the 
Applicant has included the potential risk for cardiac conduction disorders in the SmPC. 
Patients experiencing diarrhoea following administration of cabazitaxel could be treated with commonly 
used anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Appropriate measures should be taken to re-hydrate patients. 
Diarrhoea  can  occur  more  frequently  in  patients  that  have  received  prior  abdomino-pelvic  radiation. 
Dehydration is  more  common  in  patients  aged  65  or  older.  Appropriate  measures  should  be  taken  to 
rehydrate  patients  and  to  monitor  and  correct  serum  electrolyte  levels,  particularly  potassium. 
Treatment  delay  or  dose  reduction  may  be  necessary  for  grade  ≥3  diarrhoea.  If  patients  experience 
nausea or vomiting, they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics. 
Recommendations  and  warnings  related  to  the  risk  of  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea  and  dehydration 
were included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Renal failure was often multi-factorial in origin and a direct causal relationship with cabazitaxel cannot 
be determined. Haematuria is very common in patients with prostate cancer. Although more frequent 
in the cabazitaxel group, a possible explanation for the observed haematuria was found in most cases. 
Haematuria should be closely monitored. 
In the pivotal study, the number of deaths during on-treatment and post-treatment phase was higher 
for  comparator  notably  related  to  deaths  from  progressive  disease.  However,  the  number  of  deaths 
within 30 days of last infusion was of significantly higher incidence after Cabazitaxel therapy compared 
to  mitoxantrone  therapy.  The  difference  between  two  groups  reflects  the  high  incidence  of 
haematological toxicity of Cabazitaxel in comparison to mitoxantrone. The analysis of fatal cases from 
the supportive studies confirms that they are frequently due to disease progression, infections. 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  have  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  cabazitaxel.  Allergic  conditions 
and hypersensitivity to cabazitaxel, any other taxane therapy or excipients of the formulation including 
polysorbate 80 is contra-indicated for the use of this product and hypersensitivity reactions should be 
closely  monitored.  Premedication  should  also  be  performed  to  mitigate  the  risk  and  severity  of 
hypersensitivity (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
More patients discontinued the study due to disease progression in the mitoxantrone group compared 
to cabazitaxel group. However, there is a significant difference in the number of discontinuation due to 
TEAEs other than disease progression in the cabazitaxel group compared to mitoxantrone arm.

No  direct  comparison  to other  taxane  therapies  has  been  performed  by  the applicant.  A trend  of  less 
peripheral  oedema  was  noted  with  cabazitaxel.  A  higher  incidence  of  the  hematological  toxicity  was 
shown  as  well  as  more  gastrointestinal  disorders.  In  particular,  neutropenia  occurred  in  the  vast 
majority  of  patients.  Diarrhoea,  fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  asthenia,  constipation,  haematuria  and 
febrile  neutropenia  were  also  reported  to  be  significantly  more  frequent  during  cabazitaxel  therapy. 
The  rate  of  alopecia  and  nail  disorders  seems  to  be  lower  than  that  expected  with  taxane  therapy; 
however, no firm conclusion can be given. 
As  it  may  cause  fatigue  and  dizziness,  cabazitaxel  may  have  a  moderate  influence  on  the  ability  to 
drive and use machines. Adequate recommendation can be found in section 4.7 of the SmPC. 
The anticipated complications of overdose would consist of exacerbations of adverse reactions as bone 
marrow suppression and gastrointestinal disorders. Adequate recommendation regarding overdose can 
be found in section 4.9 o the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  cabazitaxel  is  associated  with  a  critical  safety  deterioration  compared  to 
mitoxantrone.  The  number  of  patients  with  any  TEAE,  serious  TEAE,  grade  ≥3  TEAE,  the  number  of 
deaths within 30 days of last infusion and withdrawals due to any TEAE was always significantly higher 
in  cabazitaxel  group  compared  to  mitoxantrone  group  of  patients.  A  risk  ratio  of  ≥2  between  the 
cabazitaxel  and  mitoxantrone  treatment  groups,  confirming  more  than  two  fold  risk  with  the  use  of 
cabazitaxel when compared to mitoxantrone, was determined for many of AEs. 
Haematological toxicity of cabazitaxel is of concern. Twice as much aenemias, thrombocytopenias and 
neutropenia  have  been  reported  during  the  pivotal  study  in  the  cabazitaxel  arm  compared  to 
mitoxantrone  arm.  Grade  ≥3  neutropenia  was  even  thrice  as  much  with  cabazitaxel  compared  to 
mitoxantrone  treatment  with  notably  more  febrile  neutropenia  in  cabazitaxel  group.    Nine  patients 
(2.4%) discontinued the cabazitaxel treatment due to Grade ≥3 neutropenia and 3 patients more due 
to  febrile  neutropenia  in  the  pivotal  study  compared  to  zero  patient  in  comparative  arm.  In  addition, 
infections  were  more  frequent  in  the  cabazitaxel-treated  arm  compared  to  mitoxantrone  arm. 
Management of these cases is recommended by monitoring of complete blood counts during treatment 
and  before  each  cycle.  Dose  modification  is  presented,  including  dose  reduction  after  prolonged 
neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. G-CSF is recommended therapeutically, as secondary prophylaxis, 
and  as  primary  prophylaxis  in  clinical  settings  of  increased  risk,  such  as  advanced  age,  poor 
performance status, extensive radiation, co-morbidities and previous episodes of febrile neutropenia. 
No  direct  comparison  to  other  taxane  therapies  has  been  performed  by  the  applicant.  Patients  who 
experienced  hypersensitivity  reactions  with  previous  taxane  treatment  should  not  be  treated  by 
cabazitaxel. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
The  Risk  Management  Plan  submitted  by  the  MAA  broadly  complies  with  the  recommended  structure 
described in Volume 9A of "The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union”.  
The  most  frequently  experienced  AEs  with  Cabazitaxel  correspond  to  those  classically  observed  with 
taxane  therapy.  Even  though  no  direct  comparison  to  other  taxanes  has  been  performed,  a  higher 
incidence of hematological AE is observed as well as gastrointestinal disorders. 
The Risk management plan proposed by the MAH is summarised on the table below.

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
Jevtana  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  hormone-refractory  metastatic  prostate  cancer 
(mHRPC)  previously  treated  with  a  docetaxel-containing  regimen  in  combination  with  prednisone  or 
prednisolone.  In  such  a  population,  the  goal  of  the  treatment  is  to  improve  the  overall  survival  or  at 
least  the  quality  of  life.  The  present  submission  is  based  on  one  single  pivotal  study.  The  primary 
objective  was  to  determine  whether  cabazitaxel/Prednisone  could  improve  overall  survival  when 
compared  to  mitoxantrone/prednisone.  cabazitaxel/Prednisone  was  associated  with  a  2.4  month 
increase in median overall survival compared to mitoxantrone/prednisone.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Secondary endpoints such as PFS, tumour response rate and tumour progression were consistent with 
the  primary  endpoint.  In  secondary  analyses,  a  median  PFS  difference  of  1.4  month  in  favour  of 
cabazitaxel/prednisone  was  also  observed.  cabazitaxel/prednisone  was  also  associated  with  higher 
response  rate  and  increased  time  to  PSA  progression.  However,  these  parameters  have  inherent 
limitations  due  to,  among  others,  ascertainment  bias,  inter-observer  variability  and  the  fact  that  no 
independent review of PFS assessment was carried out.  
There is some uncertainty about the efficacy in patients that had received less than 225 mg/m2 of 
docetaxel. Previous treatment with <225 mg/m2 cumulative dose of docetaxel was introduced as an 
exclusion criterion after protocol amendment. A sub-group of 59 patients received prior cumulative 
dose of docetaxel <225 mg/m² (29 patients in JEVTANA arm, 30 patients in mitoxantrone arm). There 
was no significant difference in overall survival in this group of patients (HR (95%CI) 0.96 (0.49-1.86)). 
This observation may be due to a lower efficacy in this subgroup due to different patient or disease 
characteristics. The low number of patients in this subgroup analysis may also explain the lack of a 
clear effect. Thus, although there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the benefits are lacking in 
this subgroup, this information has been included in the SmPC (see section 5.1) to help make an 
informed treatment choice.

Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
The number of patients with any TEAE, serious TEAE, grade ≥3 TEAE and withdrawals due to any TEAE 
were  significantly  higher  in  the  cabazitaxel  group  compared  to  mitoxantrone.  In  study  EFC6193,  the 
percentage  of  patients  who  died  from  TEAEs  (other  than  progressive  disease)  within  30  days  of  last 
infusion was 4.9% in the cabazitaxel group compared with 1.9% in the mitoxantrone group. Of the 18 
patients  who  died  in  the  cabazitaxel  group,  7  of  these  were  attributed  to  neutropenia  and  its 
consequences.  The  haematological  toxicity  was  also  higher  for  cabazitaxel/predinsone  compared  to 
mitoxantrone/prednisone. In Study EFC6193, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was higher with 
cabazitaxel  than  with  mitoxantrone  (27.5%  vs.  8.4%),  with  notably  more  febrile  neutropenia  in 
cabazitaxel  group.  In  addition,  infections  were  more  frequent  in  the  cabazitaxel  arm  compared  to 
mitoxantrone  arm.  Even  with  prophylactic  or  therapeutic  G-CSF,  cabazitaxel  was  associated  with  a 
higher rate of neutropenia leading to infections and sepsis. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As  might  be  expected  in  the  Phase  II  study,  the  side  effect  profile  for  the  <  25mg/m²  dose  was 
generally  more  favourable  when  compared  to  the  ≥25mg/m²  dose.  It  is  unclear  whether  the 
<25mg/m² dose would have similar activity to the ≥25mg/m² dose but with a more acceptable safety 
profile.  The  Applicant  has  submitted  the  protocol  of  a  randomised,  open  label  study  comparing 
cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m² and at 25 mg/m² in second line mHRPC patients. 
No direct comparison to other taxane therapies has been performed by the applicant. 
Benefit-risk balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The single most influential factor is considered to be the improvement in median overall survival. The 
pivotal study submitted met both primary and secondary endpoints with the exception of pain response. 
More subjects experienced an adverse event, a related adverse event or a treatment related death in 
the  cabazitaxel  arm.  Neutropenia  and  in  particular  febrile  neutropenia  is  an  important  treatment-
related side-effect associated with cabazitaxel/prednisone.  
  Benefit-risk balance 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  a  clear  benefit  in  terms  of  overall  survival  associated  with 
cabazitaxel/prednisone  compared  to  mitoxantrone/prednisone  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen. 
In a subgroup of patients that received previously less than 225 mg/m2 of docetaxel, the benefit in OS 
is  not  significant,  and  the  information  has  been  added  in  section  5.1.  Despite  the  increased    toxicity 
associated  with  cabazitaxel/prednisone,  an  advantage  in  overall  survival  was  observed  and  the  effect 
in terms of this endpoint was considered to be clinically and statistically significant. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The effect in terms of overall survival is similar to what has been observed with other therapies in late 
line cancers, where dramatic effects in terms of overall survival are rare due to the advanced stage of 
the disease. Due to the poor prognosis, high unmet clinical need and lack of alternative therapies, the 
observed  benefits  in  terms  of  overall  survival  are  considered  clinically  important.  There  are  no  major 
remaining uncertainties that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance. 
Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were 
needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns, no additional risk minimisation activities 
were required beyond those included in the product information.

2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Jevtana in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the 
treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a 
docetaxel-containing regimen was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the 
marketing authorization.

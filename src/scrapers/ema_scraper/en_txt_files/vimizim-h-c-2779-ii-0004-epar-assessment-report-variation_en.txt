1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, BioMarin Europe Ltd submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 6 August 2014 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data  
Update of sections 5.1 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics following 52 weeks results of 
clinical study MOR-007 conducted in paediatric patients with MPS IVA (under the age of 5 years). Deletion of 
the revision date for the Package Leaflet has also been proposed. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package 
Leaflet. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The MAH has provided additional supportive efficacy and safety data and more specifically 52 weeks results 
of clinical study MOR-007 conducted in paediatric patients with MPS IVA (under the age of 5 years). On this 
basis, the MAH proposed limited updates to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
With a new study completed (study MOR-007), the total number of studies supporting the Vimizim MA has 
increased from six to seven, and the total number of patients exposed to any dose of elosulfase alfa (safety 
population) increased from 235 to 244. The total duration of treatment ranges to 203 weeks (previously 167 
weeks) and 185 patients were exposed for a duration longer than 48 weeks (previously 86 patients). 
No new safety signals emerged from the new study MOR-007. 
The proposed Product Information changes are sufficiently supported by the data provided and are 
accepted. The benefit-risk balance of Vimizim in its approved indication remains positive.

4.  Scientific Discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Vimizim contains the active substance elosulfase alfa (recombinant). It is an approved enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis IV Type A (Morquio A syndrome, MPS IVA).  
MPS IVA is a rare and severely debilitating and progressive disease, caused by mutations of the gene that 
codes for the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which degrades 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin 6 sulfate. With insufficient 
GALNS, GAGs progressively accumulate in multiple organs and tissues. 
MPS IVA is a rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 0.06 in 10,000 live births, which leads to an 
approximate 1300 MPS IVA patients in the EU. Therfore, Vimizim received an orphan designation in the EU. 
Vimizim was approved in the EU on 28 April 2014. 
The MAH of Vimizim, BioMarin Europe Ltd., has recently completed an additional clinical trial. The MA dossier 
now includes data from seven clinical studies, including two completed studies and five ongoing studies. The 
MA is supported primarily by final results from the completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
pivotal Phase 3 study MOR-004, with supportive data from the completed Phase 1/2 study MOR-002, two 
ongoing long-term extension studies (MOR-005 and MOR-100), and three ongoing ancillary Phase 2 studies 
(MOR-006, MOR-007, and MOR-008). 
Efficacy and safety data collected from each study (except MOR-006 and MOR-008) include data up to the 
data cut-off date for each study; for MOR-006 and MOR-008, only safety data are reported. 
4.2.  Clinical aspects 
Study MOR-007 
4.2.1.  Methods –analysis of data submitted 
Study MOR-007 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate safety and tolerability of 
infusions of elosulfase alfa (BMN 110) at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/week over a 52-week period in MPS IVA 
patients.  
Patients with a documented clinical diagnosis of MPS IVA and less than 5 years of age at the time of the first 
study-drug infusion, who had not previously had hematopoietic stem cell transplants or been previously 
treated with BMN 110, were eligible to participate in this study. 
Patients received intravenous infusions of BMN 110 at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/week for up to 208 consecutive 
weeks. Each infusion is administered over a period of approximately 4 hours. 
The primary objective of the completed primary treatment phase (52 weeks) and the ongoing extension 
treatment phase (up to an additional 156 weeks for a total treatment period of 208 weeks) of the study is to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636347/2014 
Page 5/9 
 
  
  
evaluate safety and tolerability of infusions of elosulfase alfa (BMN 110) at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/week over 
a 52-week period in MPS IVA patients less than 5 years of age at time of first study drug infusion. 
Secondary objectives of the completed primary treatment phase and the ongoing extension treatment phase 
of the study were: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the ability of 2.0 mg/kg/week BMN 110 to reduce urine KS levels in MPS IVA patients 
less than 5 years of age at time of first study drug infusion. 
To evaluate the ability of 2.0 mg/kg/week BMN 110 to affect growth velocity in MPS IVA patients less 
than 5 years of age at time of first study drug infusion. 
Criteria for evaluation included the following: 
Primary Safety Variables 
•  AEs 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
vital signs 
echocardiograms 
ECGs 
immunogenicity tests 
physical examinations (including neurologic examination) 
standard clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) 
concomitant medications 
cervical spine radiography 
Secondary Variables 
• 
• 
• 
normalized urine KS concentration (normalized to urinary creatinine) 
anthropometric measurements (length, sitting height, standing height, knee height, weight, and 
head circumference (all measurements possible based on age and condition of patient) 
radiographs of the lower extremities (bone length only) 
The ongoing extension treatment phase of the study is designed to evaluate the long term safety and 
efficacy of BMN 110 treatment in patients with MPS IVA who completed the initial 52-week primary 
treatment phase of the MOR-007 study. During the extension treatment phase, patients will continue to 
complete safety and efficacy assessments for up to an additional 156 weeks. Assessments will be the same 
as those for the primary treatment phase, but with a reduced frequency. 
As patients may experience hypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of BMN 110, there 
is a requirement for premedication with an antihistamine for all age-appropriate patients within 1 hour prior 
to the start of each BMN 110 infusion. In addition, antipyretics may also be utilized as a premedication 30 to 
60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion at the discretion of the investigator. However, if a patient has 
tolerated infusions of BMN 110 for 26 weeks, premedication with antihistamine may be discontinued at the 
investigator's discretion. Vital signs are measured just before, during, and following the infusion, and 
patients are monitored by continuous pulse oximetry during and following the infusion. Changes in 
concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) are recorded throughout the study. 
If a severe or serious infusion associated reaction (IAR) or an IAR requiring cessation of the infusion occurs, 
blood samples are collected for immunogenicity testing, including total IgE, drug-specific immunoglobulin E

(IgE), complement component 4 (C4), serum tryptase, and pharmacokinetics (PK) (in order of decreasing 
priority, based on the quantity of blood available from the patient). 
An independent Allergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB), appointed by BioMarin and composed of physicians 
not directly involved with the study (including at least one allergist/immunologist), serves as consultants to 
BioMarin, the clinical team, and the Medical Monitor. The ARRB reviews severe or serious IARs, and may 
make recommendations regarding the appropriate prevention and management of IARs. A Data Monitoring 
Committee serves in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the safety of BMN 110 in patients who 
participate in clinical trials in the Morquio A program, including MOR-007. 
4.2.2.  Results 
A total of 15 patients were enrolled in Study MOR-007. As of the data cut-off date of the study (completion 
of Week 52 Visit for each patient), all patients have completed the primary treatment phase (52 weeks of 
treatment with BMN 110). All 15 patients entered the extension treatment phase of the study as of the data 
cut-off date. As this is a report of an ongoing study, final results from the extension treatment phase will be 
provided in a subsequent report. 
The study included 7 males (46.7%) and 8 females (53.3%) with mean (±SD) age of 3.1 (±1.34) years at 
enrollment. Seven of the patients were 0 to <3 years of age and 8 of the patients were ≥ 3 to<5 years of 
age. Ten (66.7%) patients were White, 4 (26.7%) patients were Asian, and 1 (6.7%) patient was East 
Asian/African American. The distribution of patients of White and Asian descent was evenly divided in both 
age groups. The mean (±SD) Baseline normalized urine KS was 35.9 (±12.32) μg/mg and ranged from 18.8 
to 56.5 μg/mg. 
The mean (± SD) duration of BMN 110 dosing was 51.9 (±0.18) weeks. The mean (±SD) weekly dose 
received was 1.9 (±0.08) mg/kg/patient, and the mean (±SD) total dose received was 98.7 (± 4.21) 
mg/kg/patient. 
Safety Results 
The safety and tolerability of BMN 110 at 2.0 mg/kg/week over 52 weeks in MPS IVA patients less than 5 
years of age at the first study drug infusion was the primary endpoint. No patients withdrew from the study 
or permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE as of the completion of the primary treatment phase 
(through Week 52 for each patient). Few infusions were missed (<5%). Overall, this suggests good 
compliance with drug administration and thus supports the tolerability of the infusions. 
All patients experienced at least one AE during the 52 weeks. The most common AEs were pyrexia (100% of 
patients), vomiting (80.0% of patients), and cough (73.3% of patients). Although pyrexia and vomiting 
were more common in this study, 46.3% of pyrexia events and 36.1% of vomiting events occurred outside 
the IAR window (>1 day following the end of the infusion) and were likely related to intercurrent illnesses 
common in early childhood. The majority of AEs were mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity (NCI 
CTCAE v. 4.0). One patient experienced severe (grade 3) AEs of tonsillar hypertrophy, tonsillectomy, and 
cervical cord compression that were all assessed as not related to study drug. There were no life-threatening 
AEs (grade 4 or above) and no deaths in the study. 
Eleven (73.3%) patients experienced at least one drug-related AE; the most common were pyrexia (40.0% 
of patients) and vomiting (33.3% of patients). All drug-related AEs were mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 
2) and resolved with symptomatic treatment and/or infusion interruption or temporary discontinuation. The 
frequency of drug-related pyrexia and vomiting events was similar to other BMN 110 studies. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for 4 (26.7%) patients. Three patients experienced SAEs (spinal 
cord oedema, joint instability, tonsillar hypertrophy, cervical cord compression, device-related infection,

skin infection, and sepsis) that were assessed as not related to study drug and were either device-related 
infections or consistent with underlying disease comorbidities. Only one patient experienced a SAE (grade 2 
Hypersensitivity) that was assessed as related to BMN 110. 
The Hypersensitivity occurred during the Week 14 infusion of BMN 110 and resolved the next day with 
symptomatic medical treatment and infusion discontinuation. The patient completed the 52 weeks of 
treatment without experiencing additional Hypersensitivity events 
Potential Hypersensitivity AEs were identified by utilizing the broad Anaphylactic Reaction algorithmic 
Standardized MedDRA (v. 15.0) Query (SMQ) and the broad Angioedema SMQ. A Hypersensitivity AE was 
reported for 4 (26.7%) patients from the Angioedema SMQ: grade 1 and 2 urticaria in 2 (13.3%) patients, 
grade 2 hypersensitivity in 2 (13.3%) patients, and grade 1 wheezing in 1 (6.7%) patient. No patients 
experienced a Hypersensitivity AE based on the Anaphylactic Reaction SMQ. 
All patients experienced at least one IAR. IARs were mild to moderate in severity and generally manageable 
with symptomatic treatment and infusion rate adjustment. Infusions requiring interruption or 
discontinuation due to an AE and requiring medical intervention represented a very small percentage of all 
743 infusions (0.8%). All patients who experienced an IAR requiring infusion interruption or discontinuation 
and medical intervention were successfully retreated at subsequent visits. 
Efficacy Results 
Normalized Urine KS: Treatment with BMN 110 led to a substantial decrease in mean normalized urine KS 
levels within 2 weeks and the decreased levels were maintained over 52 weeks. The mean (±SD) percent 
change from Baseline in urine KS was -30.2% (±12.68; n=15) at 2 weeks, and -39.9% (±24.03; n=15) at 
26 weeks, and -43.5% (±22.15; n=10) at 52 weeks. These results, as of the data cutoff date for this report, 
show a comparable decline in urine KS to the reduction observed in older children and adult patients in the 
BMN 110 Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies. 
Normalized standing height z-score: There was minimal change in mean normalized standing height z-score 
after 52 weeks of treatment with the mean normalized standing height z-score decreasing slightly from 
Baseline to Week 52 (-1.6 to -1.9 for all patients; -2.0 to -2.2 for patients ≥ 2 years of age). Given the typical 
progression of disease in older children which shows an increasing deviation from normal standing height 
with age [mean z-score -5.00 for ages 5 to11 and -7.27 for ages12 to18 (Harmatz, 2013, Mol Genet 
Metab)], the suggestive trend towards stabilization of normalized standing height z-scores in this young 
patient group (< 5 years of age) after 52 weeks of treatment may indicate that BMN 110 slows the 
progressive negative deviation. 
Normalized growth rate z-scores: The mean normalized growth rate z-scores numerically improved for all 
patients (n=15) and for the subgroup of patients ≥ 2 years of age (n=12) indicating a trend towards normal 
growth rates with long term BMN 110 treatment. The Baseline and Week 52 mean (± SD) normalized growth 
rate z-scores were -0.6 (± 0.64) and -0.4 (± 0.53), respectively, for all patients and -0.8 (± 0.78) and -0.3 
(± 0.53), respectively, for patients ≥ 2 years of age. 
Positive changes in the absolute values of anthropometric measurements (length, sitting height, knee 
height, weight, and head circumference) and measurements of lower extremities by radiographs were 
observed. However, given the paucity of longitudinal natural history data in this age range and the variability 
in these parameters in the normal populations, further data from the extension phase of the study will be 
needed in order to determine the significance of these early changes. 
The mean (± SD) skeletal bone age (as determined by hand/wrist radiographs) at Baseline was 3.6 (± 1.23) 
years and at Week 52 was 4.6 (± 0.63) years. The mean change was 0.8 (± 0.85) years and is within 
anticipated changes in normal children.

Immunogenicity Results 
BMN 110-specific antibody development (TAb) was universal among all treated patients and was sustained 
by Week 51 with a mean (±SD) titer of 135600.0 (± 139016.8). No patients tested positive for BMN 
110-specific IgE as of completion of their Week 52 Visits. 
Reductions in urine KS occurred and were maintained, despite the development of anti-BMN 110 antibodies. 
Patients with TAb titers greater than the mean had similar decreases in urine KS compared to patients with 
TAb titers below the mean by the end of their Week 52 Visits: mean (± SE) urine KS 18.5 (± 1.90) versus 
15.0 (± 2.92), respectively. No apparent relationship was observed between TAb titers and height z-score 
measurements. 
The overall number of patients that experienced Hypersensitivity AEs was low making it difficult to identify 
a persistent trend between incidence rate of Hypersensitivity AEs and TAb titers. 
4.2.3.  Discussion 
The results of the submitted study MOR-007 support the existing indication in patients of all ages. Based on 
the review of the newly available data, no Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) that are not covered by the 
current SmPC have been identified and the frequency of occurrence of the ADRs is equal to what was already 
known. Therefore no changes to the table of ADRs in section 4.8 are necessary.  
4.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated. 
As study MOR-007 was designed to study the effects in younger patients (<5 years of age), the MAH 
proposes to add the following wording to section 4.8 of the SmPC (newly added text in blue, and removed 
text in red): 
‘In patients < 5 years of age, the overall safety profile of Vimizim at 2 mg/kg/week was consistent with 
the safety profile of Vimizim observed in older children.’ 
In relation to the same results the MAH also updates the paragraph Paediatric population in section 5.1 with 
the following wording: 
‘It is important to initiate treatment as early as possible. Treatment of young children < age 5 years 
might be started although this population was not included in the pivotal study. 
The majority of patients who received Vimizim during clinical studies were in the paediatric and 
adolescent age range (5 to 17 years).  In an open-label trial, 15 paediatric patients with MPS IVA 
under the age of 5 years (9 months to <5 years) received 2 mg/kg of Vimizim once a week for 52 
weeks. Safety and pharmacodynamic results in these patients are consistent with results observed in 
patients 5 to 57 years old (see sections 4.8).’ 
Safety results to date in 15 patients less than 5 years of age are consistent with results observed in 
patients 5 to 57 years old.

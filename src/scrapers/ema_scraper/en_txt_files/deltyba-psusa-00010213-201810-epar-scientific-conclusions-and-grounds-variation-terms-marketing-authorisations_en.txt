Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for delamanid, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
The PRAC noted the recurrent concomitant use of delamanid with bedaquiline in patients experiencing QTc 
prolongation. Since both medications are known to prolong the QT interval, the MAH is asked to update the 
SmPC and PL of delamanid to list bedaquiline as one of the concomitant drugs known to prolong the QTc 
interval. 
There is evidence in the last PSUR to suspect the possibility of a causal relationship of liver disorders with 
delamanid,  but  the  scientific  evidence  is  insufficient  to  conclude  that  the  association  is  causal.  Liver 
disorders is categorised as an important potential risk. The PRAC requests a cumulative review of this risk in 
next PSUR, using appropriate PT terms, in order to assess whether an update of the risk is needed.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for delamanid the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing delamanid is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

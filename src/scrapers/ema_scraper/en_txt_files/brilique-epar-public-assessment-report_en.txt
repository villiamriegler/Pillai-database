2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Acute  coronary  syndrome  (ACS)  encompasses  the  spectrum  of  threatened,  evolving,  and  completed 
myocardial  infarction  (MI).  Despite  the  widespread  adoption  of  intensive  monitoring  and  prompt 
treatment of cardiac electrical instability, thrombolytic therapy, acute invasive interventions, and dual 
antiplatelet  therapy  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA)  and  thienopyridines,  approximately  1  in  3  ACS 
patients  dies,  has  a  repeat  MI,  or  requires  re-hospitalisation  within  6  months.  Current  guidelines 
indicate  dual  antiplatelet therapy  with  ASA  and  clopidogrel  for all ACS  patients.  An  electrocardiogram 
(ECG)  shows  ST-elevation  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI)  or  a  non-ST  elevation  (NSTEMI)  ACS  event. 
Those  with  STEMI  usually  receive  accelerated  care,  including  cardiac  catheterisation,  leading  to 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 4/50 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI),  coronary  artery  bypass  (CABG)  surgery,  or  management 
with  medication  alone.  For  them,  time  from  presentation  to  re-establishing  coronary  flow  impacts 
survival.  Those  with  NSTEMI-ACS  have  the  same  treatment  options;  however,  interventions  are  less 
time-critical.  NSTEMI-ACS  patients  will  less  urgently  be  diagnosed  with  either  a  documented  MI 
(NSTEMI),  or  unstable  angina  (UA).  Platelet  inhibitors  have  been  proven  as  effective  agents  for  the 
treatment  of  both  chronic  and  acute  diseases  of  the  arterial  vessel  wall.  Low  dose  acetylsalicylic  acid 
(ASA) reduces ischaemic outcomes in patients but often is insufficient to prevent ischaemic events in 
high-risk  patients.  While  ASA  inhibits  the  cyclooxygenase  (COX)  pathway,  it  has  no  known  effect  on 
the  adenosine  diphosphate  (ADP)  P2Y12  platelet  receptor.  Inhibition  of  ADP-mediated  platelet 
activation and aggregation by ticlopidine and clopidogrel has been shown to provide improved efficacy 
for treatment of thrombotic ischaemic events, compared with ASA therapy alone, while demonstrating 
a favourable bleeding profile. However, both ticlopidine and clopidogrel have an irreversible inhibition 
of platelet aggregation (IPA).  
Ticagrelor  (formerly  known  as  AZD6140)  is  a  reversible,  selective  P2Y12-receptor  antagonist  (anti-
platelet agent) being developed to reduce thromboembolic events in patients with atherosclerosis. It is 
orally active and does not require metabolic activation. Proposed and granted indication is: “Ticagrelor, 
co-administered  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA),  is  indicated  for  the  prevention  of  thrombotic  events 
(cardiovascular  death,  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke)  in  patients  with  Acute  Coronary  Syndromes 
(unstable  angina,  non  ST  elevation  Myocardial  Infarction  [NSTEMI]  or  ST  elevation  Myocardial 
Infarction  [STEMI])  including  patients  managed  medically,  and  those  who  are  managed  with 
percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)  or  coronary  artery  by-pass  grafting  (CABG)”.  The  dosing 
regimen is an initial single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then continued at 90 mg 
twice  daily.  Treatment  is  recommended  for  at  least  12  months  unless  discontinuation  of  ticagrelor  is 
clinically indicated. 
The  clinical  development  program  of  ticagrelor  comprises  41  phase  I  and  four  phase  II  clinical 
pharmacology (PK and/or PD) studies, two phase II dose selection studies and a single pivotal phase 
III trial in over 18,000 ACS patients. A second phase III trial is planned to evaluate the benefit/risk of 
ticagrelor  on  top  of  aspirin  in  patients  with  a  history  of  ACS.  An  overview  of  the  clinical  program  is 
provided  below.  Scientific  advice  by  EMEA  was  provided:  EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/330223/2005  and 
EMEA/51999/2006.  The  application  includes  an  EMA  decision  on  the  agreeing  of  a  PIP,  granting  a 
deferral and granting a product specific waiver (P/199/2009). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Brilique is presented as round, biconvex, yellow, film-coated tablets containing 90 mg of ticagrelor as 
active substance. The tablets are marked with ‘90’ above ‘T’ on 1 side and plain on the reverse. Other 
ingredients  are:  mannitol,  dibasic  calcium  phosphate,  sodium  starch  glycollate,  hydroxypropyl-
cellulose,  magnesium  stearate,  hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  talc,  polyethylene  glycol  and 
ferric  oxide  yellow.  The  tablets  are  packed  in  PVC-PVDC  blisters  sealed  with  aluminium  foil  and  the 
blisters are packed in cardboard carton.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance  
The 
chemical  name 
of 
ticagrelor 
is 
(1S,2S,3R,5S)-3-[7-{[(1R,2S)-2-(3,4-Difluorophenyl) 
cyclopropyl]amino}-5-(propylthio)-3H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-5-(2-hydroxyethoxy) 
EMA/7143/2011

cyclopentane-1,2-diol  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C23H28F2N6O4S  and  molecular  weight 
522.57 g/mol. 
It appears as a white or off-white to pale pink powder which does not exhibit pH dependent solubility 
and is defined as ‘low solubility’ under the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). Having also a 
low permeability, ticagrelor is a BCS class IV compound.  
Ticagrelor is a complex carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with 6 stereocentres. Correct configurations of 
all  stereocentres  are  established  by  stereo-selective  chemistry  of  the  starting  materials.  Extensive 
polymorph  screening  has  confirmed  the  existence  of  several  crystal  modifications  of  ticagrelor.  There 
are  4  non-solvated  polymorphs  (Polymorph  I,  II,  III  and  IV)  and  a  number  of  solvated  crystalline 
modifications  that  are  clearly  distinguishable  by  X-Ray  Powder  Diffraction.  Other  properties  such  as 
hygroscopicity,  thermal  behaviour,  partition  coefficient  and  specific  optical  rotation  have  been 
adequately studied and discussed.  
Manufacture 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  comprises  6  steps  and  is  based  on  3  starting  materials  for 
which acceptable specifications have been presented.  
Ticagrelor  has  6  stereocenters  resulting  in  64  theoretical  stereoisomers  including  the  ticagrelor 
molecule itself. Control of the isomers is ensured with a four-step strategy:  
- 
- 
- 
stereoselective chemistry early in the synthetic pathway,  
stereochemical control of impurities in the specification of the proposed starting materials,  
thorough  understanding  of  the  potential  formation  of  stereochemical  impurities  during  the 
manufacturing process,  
- 
thorough knowledge of the stereochemical impurities potentially present. 
Data  confirming  stereospecificity  is  presented  and  supports  that  a  chiral  method  for  the  detection  of 
the enantiomer is not required.  
The polymorphic form is relevant in view of the low solubility of the active substance and the solid oral 
dosage  form  in  which  it  is  presented.  Consistent  manufacture  of  the  same  polymorphic  form  is 
therefore  essential;  this  has  been  sufficiently  confirmed  by  batch  analyses  which  confirm  also  that 
epimerisation does not take place during synthesis or routine storage.  
The  provided  information  and  discussion  on  the  characteristics  of  the  active  substance  and  potential 
polymorphic forms is considered sufficient. 
Adequate  In-Process  Controls  are  applied  during  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance.  The 
specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents,  have 
been presented and are satisfactory. Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their 
origin  and  potential  carry-over  into  the  final  drug  substance.  Batch  analysis  data  produced  with  the 
proposed synthetic routes provided show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly.  
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 6/50 
 
 
  
 
 
Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  principles  were  applied  to  the  development  of  the  ticagrelor  synthetic  route 
and  manufacturing  process.  The  critical  quality  attributes  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  product 
performance  have  been  identified  using  the  principles  as  outlined  in  ICH  Q8  and  Q9.  Failure  Mode, 
Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) has been the main tool for the risk assessment. Parameters of 
design  spaces  have  been  adequately  translated  into  a  control  strategy.  The  division  into  key  process 
parameters and critical process parameters is considered correct.  
Specification 
The  active  substance  specifications  includes  tests  for  description,  identification  (IR),  assay  (HPLC), 
residual  solvents  (GC),  catalysts,  organic  impurities  (HPLC),  potential  genotoxic  impurity,  sulphated 
ash, particle size and polymorphic form.  
The  specifications  reflect  all  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  active  substance.  Impurity  limits  in  the 
specifications are justified by toxicological studies.  
Stability 
Stability studies were conducted in line with ICH guidelines. Stability data on the active substance have 
been  provided  for  three  full  scaled  batches  stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  (24  months),  30°/75%  RH  (12 
months)  and  40°C/75%  RH  (6  months)  plus  one  additional  production  scaled  batch  manufactured  at 
another  location  covering  3  months  at  all  three  conditions.  All  results  remain  within  the  specification 
over  the  tested  period  at  all  conditions  what  corroborates  that  the  substance  is  very  stable.  The 
proposed re-test period and storage conditions are acceptable. 
Degradations  products  were  also  investigated  in  one  batch  under  stress  conditions  stability  studies 
(thermal, humidity and light).  
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate release tablet containing 90 
mg of ticagrelor.  
Because  ticagrelor  is  a  low  soluble  drug  substance  (not  ionised  in  the  physiological  pH  range)  and 
exhibits a moderate intrinsic permeability, there is potentially a higher risk that changes in formulation 
and  processing  parameters  can  affect  clinical  performance,  and  this  was  taken  into  account  during 
development.  Moreover,  this  low  aqueous  solubility  of  ticagrelor  leads  to  an  increase  of  relevance  of 
particle size. Nevertheless, extensive dissolution studies, including solubility studies in human intestinal 
fluids,  were  performed  and  suggest  that  ticagrelor  may  be  less  sensitive  to  process  and  formulation 
parameters than what would be expected from its formal BCS classification.  
The pharmaceutical development of the product has been adequately performed using the principles of 
quality risk management described in ICH Q8 ‘pharmaceutical development’; Failure Mode, Effects and 
1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 7/50 
 
  
 
 
                                               
Criticality  Analysis  (FMECA)  has  been  the  main  tool  used  for  risk  assessment  throughout  the 
development process. 
The  compatibility  of  ticagrelor  with  a range  of  commonly  used  pharmaceutical  excipients,  suitable  for 
tablets has been investigated throughout development and the following were retained: mannitol (as a 
diluent),  dibasic  calcium  phosphate  (as  a  diluent),  sodium  starch  glycollate  (as  a  disintegrant), 
hydroxypropyl-cellulose  (as  a  binder),  magnesium  stearate  (as  a  lubricant),  purified  water  (as  a 
lubrication  fluid),  hypromellose  (as  a  film  former),  titanium  dioxide  (as  an  opacifier),  talc  (as  an 
opacifier and lubricant), polyethylene glycol (as a plasticiser), ferric oxide yellow (as a colouring agent) 
and purified water (as solvent). The choice and function of the excipients in the final formulation have 
been described and justified. The composition of the tablets has evolved since the phase I studies but 
in vivo bioequivalence studies have confirmed the equivalence of the formulations. The excipients are 
conventional  and  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Ph.  Eur.  Except  ferric  oxide  which  complies  with  the 
specification s of the Annex of Directive 95/45/EC.  
None  of  the  materials  used  in  the  synthesis  of  ticagrelor  active  substance  and  excipients  used  in  the 
film-coated tablets is of animal or human origin and therefore there is no risk of TSE contamination.  
A  wet  granulation  process  was  chosen  and  the  formulation  was  optimised  using  multivariate 
experiment design. Satisfactory discussion on the development of the formulation and the dissolution 
characteristics  is  provided  in  the  dossier.  Critical  aspects  that  could  affect  the  dissolution  have 
sufficiently been discussed (e.g. polymorphic form, particle size, production parameters etc.) 
When  developing  the  manufacturing  process,  a  quality  target  product  profile  has  been  made,  critical 
quality  attributes  have  been  defined  and  discussed,  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  selected 
based on these aspects and a control strategy has been defined.  
A  quality  by  design  approach  was  applied  to  the  container  closure  system  and  three  design  space 
boundaries have been set: chemical compatibility, moisture ingress and the level of protection against 
UV light. Stability studies on the tablets have thus confirmed the suitability of the chosen packaging: 
PVC/PVDC/Alu blisters.  
Manufacture of the product 
Ticagrelor  film-coated  tablets  are  manufactured  using  conventional  manufacturing  techniques.  The 
manufacturing  process  consists  of  8  consecutive  steps:  1)  granulation  including  dry  mixing;  2)  wet 
granulation; 3) drying; 4) milling; 5) lubrication; 6) compression; 7) coating and 8) packaging.  
A  flow  diagram  of  each  step  is  presented  including  reference  to  the  IPCs.  A  tabulated  overview  of 
typical  equipment  is  presented  including  relevant  references.  Justifications  for  the  manufacturing 
process elements of the ticagrelor tablets design space are provided. Critical steps are controlled by in-
process  testing  applied  during  the  manufacturing  process  to  ensure  that  the  critical  quality  attributes 
are met.   
Data  from  batches  of  ticagrelor  film-coated  tablets  manufactured  at  pilot  scale,  at  both  development 
and  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  sites  are  presented.  Continuous  process  verification,  as 
important aspect of QbD approach, is applied.  
Product Specification  
The  product  specification at  release  includes  tests  for  description, identity  tests  (NIR,  or HPLC/UV, or 
UPLC/UV),  identity  of  colorant,  assay  (HPLC  or  NIR  or  UPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC  or  UPLC), 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 8/50 
 
  
 
 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.). The same requirements apply for shelf 
life requirements.  
The analytical methods have been adequately described and validated. Batch analytical data on 42 full 
scale  batches  from  the  proposed  production  sites  demonstrates  that  the  finished  product  can  be 
manufactured reproducibly according with the release specification.  
Stability of the product 
Data from 3 pilot batches manufactured at the production site is presented. The stability studies have 
been performed in accordance with ICH guideline Q1A under long-term, intermediate, accelerated and 
stressed  conditions  (24  months  at  25°C/60%  RH,  24  months  at  30°C/75%  RH  and  6  months  at 
40°C/75%  RH).  The  parameters  studied  are  the  same  as  at  shelf  life;  water  content  and  hardness 
were added during the stability studies.  
An  increase  in  water  content  was  observed  under  all  conditions;  nevertheless,  this  change  is  not 
considered  significant  and  do  not  impact  on  any  of  the  critical  quality  attributes  such  as  assay, 
degradation  products,  dissolution  and  microbiology).  Based  on  the  available  data,  the  proposed  shelf 
life and storage conditions for the bulk product or for the drug product packed in the proposed blister 
as stated in the SPC are accepted.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In  general  satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided  to  confirm  the  acceptable  quality  of  this 
medicinal  product,  and  no  major  objections  have  been  raised  during  evaluation.  The  drug  substance 
has been adequately characterized and the specification is acceptable in view of the route of synthesis 
and  the  various  ICH  guidelines.  The  solid  drug  substance  is  stable  with  respect  to  degradation. 
Concerning  the  finished  product  the  complete  control  strategy  and  an  established  manufacturing 
process  guarantees  consistent  control  of  the  product  quality  which  should  have  a  satisfactory  and 
uniform performance in the clinic. The drug product is stable with respect to degradation. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  a  number  of  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  having  no 
impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ration  of  the  product.  The  applicant  provided  a  letter  of  undertaking  and 
committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion within an agreed timeframe.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Ticagrelor  and  its  major  circulating  metabolite  AR-C124910XX  are  potent  antagonists  of  the  platelet 
P2Y12  receptor  that  produces  reversible  and  concentration-related  inhibition  of  ADP-induced  platelet 
aggregation both in vitro and ex vivo. In a non-P2Y12 mediated aggregation assay, ticagrelor showed 
no effect on platelet aggregation. It is suggested that ticagrelor acts as an allosteric modulator of the 
P2Y12 receptor. In vivo, ticagrelor has been shown to eliminate platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis 
in  the  damaged,  stenosed  femoral  artery  of  anesthetized  dogs.  For  a  given  anti-thrombotic  effect, 
ticagrelor  produces  significantly  less  impairment  of  homeostasis  than  the  GPIIb/IIIa  antagonist 
orbofiban and marginally better selectivity over the thienopyridine agent clopidogrel. The Applicant has 
discussed the lack of in vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies in the main species selected for toxicity 
testing (i.e. rat and marmoset monkey), considering that the species used in toxicology studies should 
be  responsive  to  the  primary  pharmacodynamics  of  ticagrelor.  The  degree  of  homology  of  the  P2Y12 
receptor  sequence  is  high,  especially  in  the  marmoset,  96.2%  and  maintaining  the  interaction  sites 
with man. In the rat, the homology is also high, 85.7%, but three differences in the binding site were 
noted. These data are considered sufficient to support the relevance of the primary pharmacodynamic 
data  in  man  included  in  the  initial  submission.  In  addition,  the  Applicant  characterized  primary 
pharmacodynamics  of  the  two  major  metabolites:  AR-C124910XX  and  AR-C133913XX  in  the  relevant 
non-clinical  species.  The  potency  of  ticagrelor,  AR-C124910XX  and  AR-C133913XX  is  considered 
similar  in  human  and  the  two  relevant  non-clinical  species,  rat  and  marmoset.    AR-C124910XX  could 
be  even  more  potent  in  the  rat  and  marmoset,  and  more  potent  than  ticagrelor.  According  to 
previously  submitted  data,  AR-C124910XX  was  a  major  metabolite  in  all  non-clinical  species  and  in 
man and therefore adequately qualified in the non-clinical programme. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Apart from platelets, the P2Y12 receptor is also expressed in the spinal cord, brain, microglia, vascular 
smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, CD34 positive stem cells and pancreatic islets. Based on the clinical 
experience  with  ticagrelor  and  other  P2Y12  receptor  antagonists  already  in  clinical  use,  no  clear 
relevance  of  non-platelet  P2Y12  clinical  effects  are  evident.  However,  in  vascular  smooth  muscle  cell 
preparations  expressing  P2Y12  receptors,  ticagrelor  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  ADP-induced 
vasoconstriction,  suggesting  that  ticagrelor  might  have  a  dual  anti-ischemic  effect  by  inhibiting  both 
thrombus  formation  as  well  as  vasospasm.  Ticagrelor  did  not  show  significant  agonist  or  antagonist 
activity  against  any  other  P2  receptor  types.  Regarding  human  P1  receptors,  ticagrelor  showed  low 
affinity (Ki >10µM) for the adenosine A1, A2A and A2B receptors, but higher affinity (Ki = 104 nM) for 
the adenosine A3 receptor. The in vitro and ex-vivo data do not provide a clear conclusion to whether 
the interaction of ticagrelor with the adenosine A3 receptor is agonistic or antagonistic. Overall, given 
its affinity for the P2Y12-receptor (Ki, 2.0 nM), ticagrelor has shown 50-fold less affinity for the human 
P1  receptor  subtypes.  Ticagrelor  inhibited  human  erythrocyte  adenosine  uptake.  This  inhibition  of 
adenosine  uptake  following  treatment  with  ticagrelor  is  most  likely  achieved  by  inhibiting  sodium 
independent  adenosine  transporters.  Under  hypoxic  condition,  ticagrelor  amplifies  inhibition  of 
adenosine uptake, suggesting that ticagrelor might show increased potency in patients suffering from 
hypoxic  diseases  like  acute  coronary  syndromes.  There  might  be  clinical  relevance  for  the  in  vitro 
EMA/7143/2011

observed  adenosine  uptake  inhibition  by  ticagrelor,  since  ticagrelor  enhanced  the  adenosine-induced 
increase  in  coronary  blood  flow,  following  both  endogenous  induction  of  adenosine  via  temporary 
occlusion  of  the  left  anterior  descending  coronary  artery  and  local  administration  of  adenosine  via  a 
direct  infusion.  Ticagrelor  and  its  metabolite  did  not  significantly  affect  adenosine  metabolism,  since 
they  were  weak  inhibitors  of  adenosine  deaminase,  the  enzyme  which  metabolises  adenosine  into 
inosine.  Next  to  adenosine  A3  receptors  and  adenosine  transporters,  ticagrelor  significantly  inhibited 
GPR17,  a  G-protein  coupled  receptor  activated  by  both  uracil  nucleotides  and  cysteinyl-leukotrienes. 
GPR17 is highly expressed in brain, heart and kidney tissue and involved in propagation of secondary 
ischemic damage. Hence, potent inhibition of GPR17 by ticagrelor in the nanomolar range could result 
in  reduction  of  the  infarct  area  as  previously  demonstrated  in  a  rat  stroke  model,  although  it  is  not 
confirmed at the moment. There are no grounds for further safety concern regarding ticagrelor action 
on GPR17 receptor at this moment. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  to  examine  the  potential  effects  of  ticagrelor  on  the 
cardiovascular,  respiratory,  renal,  central,  peripheral  and  autonomic  nervous  systems  and  the 
gastrointestinal  tract.  Although  ticagrelor  rather  potently  inhibited  the  hERG  potassium  channel, 
increase  in  QT  prolongation  is  not  expected  since  the  IC50  value  (1.72  μM)  is  approximately  80-fold 
higher  than  the  maximum  free  plasma  concentration  seen  in  humans  (0.025  μM).  In  addition, 
ticagrelor  did  not  affect  action  potential  duration  in  isolated  canine  Purkinje  fibers.  Moreover,  in 
preclinical  in  vivo  studies  and  in  clinical  trials,  no  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  was  observed 
following  treatment  with  ticagrelor.  In  vivo,  no  significant  ticagrelor-related  effects  were  seen  on 
cardiovascular,  central,  peripheral  or  autonomic  nervous  system  following  administration  of  1,  10  or 
100 mg/kg ticagrelor. In contrast, adverse effects on the respiratory and renal system were observed 
following exposure to oral doses ≥ 10 mg/kg, whereas adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system 
were  observed  following  exposure  to  oral  doses  of  100  mg/kg.  Similar  adverse  effects  are  also 
observed in the clinical trials. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Coadministration  of  ticagrelor  with  aspirin  and  the  thrombin  inhibitor  melagatran  or  the  other  P2Y12 
antagonists  clopidogrel  and  cangrelor  did  not  affect  ticagrelor  -induced  thrombocyte  aggregation  or 
increase bleeding time. In addition, simultaneous treatment with desmoressin or fibrinolysis inhibitors 
did  not  significantly  reverse  prolongation  of  bleeding  time  or  anti-thrombotic  aeffects  caused  by 
ticagrelor. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  of  ticagrelor  were  investigated  in  the  same 
species,  and  in  most  cases  the  same  strains,  used  to  establish  its  non-clinical  pharmacologic  and 
toxicologic  profiles  (e.g.  rat,  dog  and  Marmoset  monkey).  In  addition,  the  kinetics  of  the  active 
metabolite  AR  C124910XX  was  investigated.  However,  in  vivo  absorption  studies  in  dog  showed  that 
the  exposure  ratio  of  AR  C124910XX/ticagrelor  following  oral  ticagrelor  dosing  was  lower  in  dog 
compared to the other species tested including man. 
The  analysis  of  ticagrelor  in  plasma  was  performed  with  reversed  phase  liquid-chromatography  and 
single mass spectrometry (LC MS). The methods were developed to determine exposure of ticagrelor in 
various  species  and  included  determination  of  the  active  metabolites  AR-C124910XX  and  AR-
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 11/50 
 
  
 
 
C133913XX. The different methods were precise and accurate. Sample preparation prior to the LC-MS 
process was protein precipitation or dilution. Ticagrelor has shown indications of adhering to glass, but 
not  to  plastic  containers  at  low  organic  compositions.  Ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX  were  stable  at  -
20°C for ≥7 months in plasma for the used species, except in Cynomolgus plasma where the stability 
was 87 days. The stability of AR C133913XX has not been determined as extensively as for the other 
analytes, but was considered to  be stable for ≥48  days in mouse, rat, rabbit, and Marmoset monkey 
plasma at -20°C. 
In rat, a moderate plasma clearance (27 ml/min×kg) and a large volume of distribution at steady state 
(4.8  l/kg)  were  calculated.  The  terminal  half-life  was  determined  to  be  about  3  h.  The  oral 
bioavailability was 88% after an oral dose of 20 mg/kg given as suspension. Female rats generally had 
greater  ticagrelor  exposure  than  male  rats.  In  Marmoset  monkey,  the  half-life  of  ticagrelor  in  the 
Marmoset was 5-7.5 h with a plasma clearance of 11 ml/min×kg and a volume of distribution at steady 
state of 3.7 l/kg. The bioavailability after oral dosing was 37%. In humans, ticagrelor undergoes rapid 
absorption with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 to 3 h after oral administration. AR-C124910XX 
is formed rapidly, attaining peak plasma concentrations 2 to 3 hours after oral ticagrelor ingestion. The 
steady-state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is low, indicating that it does not extensively distribute 
into or bind to tissues. The volume of distribution in non-clinical species and humans is very different, 
4-5  l/kg  in  rat  and  Marmoset  monkey  and  1.25  l/kg  in  humans.  The  half-life  is  shorter  in  the  non-
clinical  species  compared  to  humans;  4  h  versus  7  h.  Tmax  is  comparable  between  humans  and  the 
non-clinical species (~3 h). The AR-C124910XX/ticagrelor AUC ratio after single oral dosing was 0.23 
in human, 0.43 in rat, 0.09 in dog, 0.38 in Marmoset monkey and 1.35 in Cynomolgus monkey. Dog 
showed a lower exposure ratio of AR C124910XX/ticagrelor compared to human.  
Cynomolgus monkeys showed a shorter half-life than rat, Marmoset monkey and human and a higher 
AR  C124910XX/ticagrelor  ratio  than  humans.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  dog  and 
Cynomolgus  monkey  are  not  suitable  animal  species  for  non  clinical  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicology 
studies.  In  rat,  the  exposure  of  ticagrelor  seems  linear  from  1  to  20  mg/kg  and  more  than  dose 
proportional  at  >20  mg/kg.  In  humans  and  Marmoset  monkeys,  linear  kinetics  was  observed.  The 
exposure  of  AR  C124910XX  increased  more  than  dose  proportional  over  the  ticagrelor  administered 
dose range. The data indicate linear kinetics in Marmoset monkeys and humans. 
After IV and PO ticagrelor administration, radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed. The highest 
concentrations of total radioactivity were observed in the organs of elimination (liver and kidney) and 
glandular  tissues  (e.g.  adrenal,  pituitary  and  thyroid  glands).  Also  pancreas,  uveal  tract,  heart  and 
secretory region of the gastro-intestinal tract contained relatively high levels of radioactivity. Very low 
levels of radioactivity were observed in the brain. There was little evidence of melanin-specific binding 
of radioactivity in the pigmented tissues (uveal tract and pigmented skin). Elimination of radiolabelled 
components from all tissues was relatively rapid with no apparent accumulation in any tissue including 
the  pigmented  skin  and  eye  after  a  single  dose.  However,  in  humans  some  accumulation  can  be 
expected  due  to  the  twice  daily  dosing  and  the  radioactivity  present  in  some  organs  (liver,  lung  and 
glandular  tissues)  after  16  h  in  rat.  The  radioactivity  observed  in  the  secretory  region  of  the  gastro-
intestinal tract indicates active secretion of radioactivity. Entero-hepatic recirculation is possible based 
on the plasma concentration – time curve. 
The  major  route  of  excretion  of  ticagrelor  and  its  metabolites  is  via  the  faeces  and  is  independent  of 
route  of  administration  or  gender.  Elimination  via  faeces  in  mouse,  rat  and  Marmoset  monkey  was 
≥92%, ~85% and ~60%, respectively. Ticagrelor was the major component excreted in faeces (40% 
in rat, 25% in Marmoset and 27% in humans). AR C124910XX (~5% in rat and monkey and 22% in 
humans)  and  AR  C133913XX  (3-5%  in  rat,  monkey  and  human)  were  detected,  but  also  some  other 
metabolites were present for≥3% of the administered dose. In bile, a ketone of ticagrelor (~15%) and 
oxidation  products  of  the  parent  and  AR-C124910XX  metabolite  (combined  total  of  ~20%)  were  the 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 12/50 
 
  
 
 
major  components.  Other  significant  components  identified  in  the  bile  were  the  parent  compound 
(7%),  AR-C133913XX  (5%),  loss  of  the  hydroxy-ethyl  side  chain  from  AR-C133913XX  (5%)  and  a 
sulphate  conjugate  of  oxidised  AR  C124910XX  (5%).  The  metabolite  pattern  in  bile  is  different  from 
faeces,  indicating  metabolism  in  the  intestine  back  to  the  parent  compound.  Following  an  IV  dose  to 
bile-duct  cannulated  rats,  ~70%  of  the  total  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  bile  and  ~11%  was 
excreted in faeces, indicating active secretion via the gastro-intestinal wall. In Marmoset monkey, the 
excretion  was  relatively  slow  with  about  40%  and  50%  recovered  in  faeces  by  24  h  post  PO  and  IV 
administration, respectively. 
After  a  single  IV-injection  at  day  18  of  gestation,  [3H]-Ticagrelor  and  its  radioactive  metabolites 
transferred  to  the  placenta,  with  levels  about  twice  the  level  in  circulating  blood,  but  did  not 
significantly  transfer  from  the  placenta  to  the  foetus.  However,  it  is  not  known  if  chronic  exposure 
could cause transfer of ticagrelor or its metabolites into the foetus.  
Radioactivity  was  excreted  via  milk  and  the  total  radioactivity  was  well  distributed  in  the  pup  after 
exposure via milk. Milk samples displayed significantly higher levels of total radioactivity than maternal 
plasma  during  the  whole  sampling  period.  The  total  radioactivity  in  milk  cleared  at  the  same  rate  as 
total  radioactivity  in  plasma.  The  majority  of  radioactivity  found  in  the  milk  samples  (~75%)  was 
unchanged ticagrelor at 1h post dose. A total of seven metabolites were identified in the milk samples, 
AR-C144910XX was the major metabolite and accounted for about 10% of the total radioactivity. AR-
C133913XX was also a significant metabolite detected. 
The  plasma  protein  binding  of  ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX  were  high  (≥99%).  The  level  of  protein 
binding  was  lower  for  AR-C133913XX  than  for  AR-C124910XX  and  ticagrelor  (40-57%).  The  in  vitro 
plasma  protein  binding  studies  showed  that  mice  had  very  different  protein  binding  levels.  The 
association  of  ticagrelor  with  blood  cells  was  low,  ranging  from  about  16%  in  human  blood  to  about 
48%  in  rabbit.  The  data  indicate  that  the  blood-to-plasma  ratio  is  lower  in  humans  compared  to  the 
non-clinical  species,  indicating  that  the  binding  to  the  erythrocytes  is  different.  Since  the  ratio  is  <1, 
the binding to the erythrocytes is either non-specific or when specific, with low affinity. Therefore the 
difference  in  blood-to-plasma  ratio  between  humans  and  non-clinical  species  is  considered  not 
relevant. 
Overall  the  metabolism  was  sufficiently  studied.  Ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX  contain  the 
difluorophenylcyclopropyl  group,  while  AR-C133913XX  does  not.  AR-C124910XX  is  active  and  AR 
C133913  not.  Thus,  this  group  seems  needed  for  pharmacological  activity.  The  cleavage  product 
difluorophenyl-cyclopropyl  from  ticagrelor  to  form  AR-C133913  is  not  expected  to  be  of  toxicological 
relevance. 
Ticagrelor  is moderately metabolised  mostly  by  CYP3A4  and  3A5  to  AR-C124910XX  (oxidative  loss  of 
the  hydroxyethyl  side  chain)  and  AR  C133913XX  (loss  of  the  difluorophenylcyclopropyl  group)  and 
excreted  as  parent  compound  and  metabolite,  this  is  in  line  with  the  short  half  life  of  3-4  h.  The 
cleavage product difluorophenyl-cyclopropyl from ticagrelor to form AR-C133913 is not expected to be 
genotoxic.  The  applicant 
investigated  several  CYP 
isozymes 
for  their 
involvement 
in  the 
biotransformation  of  ticagrelor.  However,  CYP2C8  and  CYP2E1  were  not  investigated  (not  as  single 
expressed  enzyme  or  in  microsomal  inhibition  studies).  It  is  unlikely  that  CYP2C8  is  involved  in  the 
metabolism of ticagrelor. However, the involvement of CYP2E1 can not be excluded and the applicant 
will  provide  these  data  as  a  post-approval  commitment.  The  intrinsic  clearance  for  ticagrelor 
metabolism to AR C124910XX and AR-C133913XX was greater for CYP3A4 than for CYP3A5, indicating 
that  the  CYP3A5-mediated  formation  of  this  metabolite  is  most  likely  to  be  of  less  importance  than 
CYP3A4  mediated  formation.  The  Applicant  stated  that  CYP3A5  is  a  minor  form  in  the  liver  and 
expressed only in 30% of the population and therefore CYP3A5 is of minor importance. However, in the 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 13/50 
 
  
 
 
population  which  has  CYP3A5  activity,  a  higher  clearance  of  ticagrelor  and  higher  levels  of  its  active 
metabolite may be observed. 
Ticagrelor was metabolised in hepatocytes, liver microsomes and Aroclor induced rat liver S9 fraction 
to a different degree between the species. In dog hepatocytes and Cynomolgus microsomes, ticagrelor 
was metabolised for more than 60% while in rat and human microsomes <10% was metabolised. AR 
C124910XX  and  AR  C133913XX  were  the  major  metabolites.  In  vitro,  a  different  metabolite 
percentage  pattern  was  observed  between  the  species,  including  the  formation  of  an  S  oxide  in  dog 
and human hepatocytes and not in rat hepatocytes; a formation of <1.7% after 4 h. No in vivo studies 
were  performed  in  dog,  but  human  in  vivo  metabolism  data  did  not  show  the  S-oxide  metabolite.  In 
vivo, ticagrelor was moderately metabolised. In humans, ticagrelor and 10 metabolites were observed. 
However,  three  metabolites  formed  via  glucuronidation  of  ticagrelor  and  AR  C124910XX  (HM9  and 
HM6,  respectively)  and  hydroxylation  of  ticagrelor  (HM10)  could  not  be  quantified  separately.  In 
Marmoset  monkeys,  the  same  metabolites  as  in  humans  were  formed  except  for  glucuronidated  AR 
C124910XX. In addition, Marmoset monkey produced 12 more metabolites than observed in humans. 
Rat  produced  11  additional  metabolites  compared  to  humans.  In  addition,  2  metabolites  (HM3  and 
HM4) were not formed in rats. Furthermore, metabolite HM9 was present in human urine, but present 
as RM13 in rat faeces. The Applicant stated that the metabolism pathways were qualitatively similar in 
rats,  Marmoset  monkeys  and  human  although  quantitative  differences  were  observed.  These  data 
indicate  differences  in  metabolism  between  the  species.  However,  the  major  metabolites  were  the 
same in rats, Marmoset monkeys and humans, except for the HM9 metabolite which was formed more 
in Marmoset monkey compared to rat and human. 
Ticagrelor  showed  no  propensity  to  inhibit  CYP1A2,  2B6,  2C8,  2C19  and  2E1,  but  showed  moderate 
inhibition  towards  CYP2D6.  In  addition,  CYP2C9  and  CYP3A5  were  inhibited  at  IC50  values  of  ~10 
μmol/l. Ticagrelor is an inhibitor of testosterone CLint in human liver microsomes with an IC50 value of 
~12 µg/ml. Activation of CYP3A4 was shown at higher concentrations of ticagrelor. In vivo drug-drug 
interaction  could  be  expected  for  CYP2C9  and  3A4.  Clinical  data  showed  drug-drug  interactions  with 
medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4, but not by CYP2C9. AR C124190XX showed no propensity 
to  inhibit  CYP1A2  and  2D6,  but  showed  moderate  inhibition  towards  CYP2B6,  2C8  and  3A4.  CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 were inhibited at IC50 values of ~10 μmol/l. Activation of CYP3A4 was shown at 
higher  concentrations  of  AR  C124910XX.  In  vivo  drug  drug  interaction  could  be  expected.  However, 
clinical  data  showed  only  a  drug-drug  interaction  with  medicinal  products  metabolised  by  CYP3A4. 
Ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX are inhibitors of CYP3A5, based on the inhibition of 
the midazolam 4-hydroxylation metabolite. The Applicant stated that CYP3A5 isozyme is active in 25-
33%  of  the  population.  Since  1’-hydroxylation  is  the  major  metabolic  pathway  for  midazolam,  the 
impact of ticagrelor on the clearance of midazolam in vivo should be small. The CHMP agreed with this 
conclusion. However, for compounds which are more selectively metabolised by CYP3A5, possible drug 
drug interactions could be expected in a significant part of the population. 
Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX are inducers of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 at concentration >10 μg/ml and >5 
μg/ml, respectively. Modest levels of induction of CYP1A2, 2B, 2C, 2E1, 2A, 3A and 4A were observed 
in  male  and  female  rats.  However,  when  compared  to  the  levels  of  induction  produced  by  archetypal 
inducers  of  CYP  the  induction  produced  was  not  considered  to  be  biologically  significant.  The  CHMP 
agreed with this conclusion. 
Ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX  are  P-gp  substrates  and  inhibitors  of  the  P-gp  mediated  transport  of 
digoxin.  Therefore,  there  is  a  potential  for  P-gp  mediated  drug  interactions.  Clinical  studies  showed 
that concomitant administration of ticagrelor with digoxin increased the digoxin Cmax (75%) and AUC 
(28%).  In  the  SPC  it is  stated  that  appropriate  clinical  and/or  laboratory  monitoring  is  recommended 
when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent drugs like digoxin concomitantly with ticagrelor.  
EMA/7143/2011

In  addition, OAT1  (transporter  of  uric  acid)  was  inhibited  in  the  presence  of  AR-C124910XX,  but  was 
not  affected  in  the  presence  of  either  ticagrelor  or  AR-C133913XX.  However,  all  three  compounds 
inhibited OAT3 (transporter of uric acid).  
Furthermore, ticagrelor, AR-C124910XX and AR C133913XX showed a potential weak inhibitory effect 
and no transport-enhancing effect on the URAT1-mediated [14C]-uric acid uptake. 
Ticagrelor has a high plasma protein binding (>99%). Ticagrelor is likely to be combined with aspirin. 
Aspirin  is  known  to  displace  a  number  of  drugs  (tolbutamide,  chlorpropamide,  methotrexate, 
phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid and NSAIDs) from protein binding sites in the blood. Furthermore, 
as much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolised in the liver. No pre-clinical studies 
were  performed  on  possible  drug-drug  interactions  of  ticagrelor  with  aspirin.  However,  this  was 
investigated in the clinical trials and no interactions on plasma protein binding or on metabolism were 
observed. 
Ingestion  of  a  high-fat  meal  resulted  in  a  21%  increase  in  ticagrelor  AUC  and  22%  decrease  in  the 
active  metabolite  Cmax,  indicating  a  possible  interaction  with  P-gp  and/or  CYP3A4/5.  The  Applicant 
concluded  that  these  changes  are  considered  of  minimal  clinical  significance.  The  in  vivo 
pharmacokinetic studies were performed under fed conditions. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity  
There was evidence of sub-clinical bleeding in all species tested in the pivotal studies. Direct effects on 
blood cell parameters and adaptive changes were observed. These changes were considered due of the 
pharmacological effect of ticagrelor. The liver was a primary target organ in mice and rats. Increases in 
liver  weight  coincided  with  centrilobular  hypertrophy  and  is  indicative  of  an  adaptive  change  in  the 
liver.  In  the  24-month  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  focal  necrosis  in  the  liver  was  seen  in  males  at  all 
dose  groups,  albeit  at  low  incidence  and  without  a  dose  response.  No  liver  effects  were  seen  in 
marmosets and signals of liver toxicity in clinical trials are questionable, therefore this effect is likely a 
rodent  specific  response  to  increased  liver  load.  Nevertheless,  from  these  results,  it  cannot  be 
completely ruled out that ticagrelor treatment induces liver toxicity, and liver toxicity in humans will be 
further  investigated  as  a  follow  up  measure  (FUM  5).  Another  primary  target  organ  of  ticagrelor 
treatment  is  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  in  particular  manifesting  itself  as  irritation  and  inflammation. 
The location and nature of the pathology varied across each species. Exposure margins were 4.3 and 
14  respectively  for  rat  and  mouse,  although  this  margin  was  almost  negligible  in  the  marmoset  (i.e. 
1.4).  Gastrointestinal  effects  observed  in  rats  (1-  and  3-month  studies)  and  marmosets  (3-  and  12-
month  studies)  were  reversible  following  an  off-dose  period.  The  cause  of  these  gastrointestinal 
adverse  effects  could  not  be  solely  attributed  either  to  an  irritant  local  effect  or  to  the  primary 
pharmacological  activity  of  ticagrelor.  Platelet  inhibition  could  impair  healing  of  the  lesions  induced 
either  by  stress  or  to  high  local  concentrations  of  ticagrelor  in  the  gastric  mucosa.  In  addition,  as 
observed  in  rats,  delayed  intestinal  transit  and  inhibition  of  gastric  emptying  may  exacerbate  this 
potential  local  toxicity  or  pre-existing  lesions.  Relevance  for  humans  cannot  be  excluded.  Signs  of 
inflammation  were  not  only  seen  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  but  also  in  other  organs  (lung,  adrenal 
gland and kidney) particularly in rats. Increases in lymphocytes and monocytes might indicate chronic 
inflammation.  Signs  of  inflammation  (white  blood  cells)  were  not  increased  among  patients  treated 
with  ticagrelor,  and  therefore  a  clinical  relevance  is  unlikely.  Besides  inflammatory  effects,  other 
effects were shown on the adrenal gland in mice and rats, which is another target organ of ticagrelor 
treatment  in  rodents.  The  relative  weight  was  increased  in  all  species,  mice  showed  cortical  cell

hyperplasia  and  rats  cortical  vacuolation  and  hypertrophy.  It  was  shown  in  a  mechanistic  in  vitro 
study, that corticosterone production in rat adrenal cells was inhibited by ticagrelor. The effects on the 
adrenal  gland  could  therefore  be  the  result  of  a  negative  feedback  mechanism.  These  effects  do  not 
appear to be species specific, as all species showed an increased adrenal weight. Moreover, inhibition 
of  corticosterone  synthesis  occurred  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations,  and  there  was  no  safety 
margin  for  histopathological  changes  in  the  rat.  However,  there  were  no  signs  of  any  effects  on  the 
adrenal  glands  in  clinical  trials,  and  therefore  a  clinical  relevance  is  unlikely.  A  lack  of  corpora  lutea 
was seen in mice at 750 mg/kg/day, a dose that was not tolerated. No other effects were noted and no 
effects on fertility were noted in rats. There is no concern for human fertility. 
Genotoxicity 
The battery of genotoxicity studies performed has shown that ticagrelor and its metabolite C124910XX 
do not possess genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
There  was  no  clear  evidence  that  ticagrelor  was  carcinogenic  in  mice  and  male  rats.  In  the  mouse 
carcinogenicity  study,  when  combining  data  on  broncho-alveolar  adenomas  for  males  and  females, 
there is an increased incidence of such tumours in exposed animals compared to concurrent controls. 
However, the incidences were not statistically significant and also within the range of historical control 
data.  Also  haemangioma/haemangiosarcoma  found  in  the  mesenteric  lymph  node  and  some  other 
organs did not display a linear dose-response and falls within the expected background range.  
In female rats, ticagrelor at the high dose (exposure margin of 29), showed an increased incidence of 
uterine  adenocarcinomas  and  hepatic  adenomas.  The  applicant  concluded  that  the  slight  increase  in 
liver tumours is likely to be related to the enzyme induction observed and concerned a species specific 
adaptive response. The Applicant demonstrated that the tumour pattern of increased uterine tumours 
and reduced  mammary and pituitary tumours are indicative of prolonged reduction in prolactin levels 
and consistent with the observed reduction of body weight in female rats at the high dose. In addition 
the interactions with the dopamine transporter and perturbations to circulating sex steroids are likely 
to contribute to the permissive hormonal environment from which this tumour pattern emerges in rats. 
Some  mechanisms  of  direct  relevance  to  humans  (e.g.  aromatase  inhibition,  oestrogen  receptor 
interactions)  have  been  ruled  out.  The  literature  data  on  prolactin  clearly  indicate  that  this  major 
indirect  feedback  influence  on  uterine  tumour  development  is  not  present  in  primates  and  would  be 
therefore  irrelevant  in  man.  However,  because  this  hypothesis  is  based  on  prolactin  levels,  and  the 
Applicant did not measure these levels directly, uterine tumours should be monitored in humans which 
should be included in the RMP. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No  effects  on  male  and  female  fertility  were  shown  in  rats  up  to  16-20  times  the  intended  human 
exposure.  In  rats  minor  developmental  anomalies  were  seen  at  a  maternal  toxic  dose  of  300 
mg/kg/day. The NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day for embryofoetal toxicity provides a safety margin of 5.1 to 
the  human  therapeutic  dose  based  on  AUC.  In  rabbits  a  slight  delay  in  hepatic  maturity  and  skeletal 
development was seen in foetuses from dams in the high dose group (63 mg/kg/day) without showing 
maternal toxicity. The NOAEL of 42 mg/kg/day provides a safety margin of 4.5 based on AUC. In rats 
180  mg/kg/day  of  ticagrelor  caused  slight  maternal  and  developmental  toxicity  characterised  by 
reduced  maternal  body  weight  gain  during  gestation  and  reduced  post-natal  pup  viability,  reduced 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 16/50 
 
  
 
 
birth weight and delayed growth of the pups. The NOAEL of 60 mg/kg/day provides a safety factor of 
4.6 based on AUC. According to the Applicant the results from the reproductive toxicity studies do not 
indicate a reproductive risk to the foetus, suckling neonate or to adults at tolerated exposures. Based 
on  this,  it  is  considered  that  ticagrelor  is  unlikely  to  affect  reproduction  at  therapeutic  exposures. 
However, the safety margins based on AUC are 3 to 5 which are relatively low. Thus it is preferable not 
to use ticagrelor during pregnancy as a precautionary measure. 
Local Tolerance 
Three  local  tolerance  studies  showed  that  ticagrelor  is  unlikely  to  cause  a  local  irritant  effect  during 
intravenous  administration  to  a  human  subject.  Because  ticagrelor  is  administrated  as  tablets,  these 
studies are only informative. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
The Applicant did not perform immunotoxicity studies, because changes in immune related tissues like 
thymus  and blood  cells, which  were  of low  severity,  are  secondary  to  other  toxicity  and  not  due  to  a 
direct  effect  of  ticagrelor on  the  immune  system.  The  absence  of  an  immunotoxic  potential is  further 
demonstrated  by  the  chronic  toxicity  studies  and  carcinogenicity  studies.  The  chronic  toxicity  studies 
also  did  not  identify  the  immune  system  as  target  organ  of  toxicity.  The  carcinogenic  studies  also 
showed no effects on the immune system. 
Impurities 
Impurities UL127, UL133 and UL134 (also an important metabolite) are above the qualification level of 
0.15%  but  non-genotoxic.  Although  the  Applicant  did  not  perform  the  animal  qualification  study  with 
the  recommended  amount  in  line  with  the  proposed  specification  or  higher  of  impurities  UL127  and 
UL133 respectively, the Applicant showed by extensive comparison of studies with different amounts of 
these impurities that it is highly unlikely that especially UL127 but also UL133 at the proposed limits in 
the  product  pose  a  significant  risk  for  toxicity  in  humans.  Several  of  impurities  have  been  tested  for 
genotoxicity  and  found  negative.  The  impurities  AZ13232761  and  C3RO  were  found  positive  and  the 
applicant stated that these impurities are kept below the threshold of toxicological concern. 
Phototoxicity 
Data  provided  by  the  Applicant  confirm  that  ticagrelor,  AR-C124910XX  and  ARC133913XX  absorb  in 
the UV spectrum at wavelengths from 290 to approximately 340 nm. However, considering that in the 
non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  ticagrelor  was  shown  to  reach  the  skin  following  systemic 
administration (p.o.), to a limited extent and only 3 out of 18,000 treated patients presented adverse 
effects  potentially  related  to  photosensitivity  on  ticagrelor,  specific  non-clinical  photosafety  testing  is 
not considered necessary at this point. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  dossier  for  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  ticagrelor  was  completed  at  day  150  of  the 
assessment. All outstanding issues have been addressed satisfactorily. A PECsurface water of 4.5 µg/L 
was  calculated  using  an  Fpen  of  0.01  (default  value).  Risk  quotients  were  below  1  for  the 
environmental  compartments  considered:  STP,  surface  water,  groundwater  and  sediment.  It  can  be 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 17/50 
 
  
 
 
concluded  that  the  use  of  ticagrelor  as  intended,  does  not  pose  an  unacceptable  risk  to  the 
environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  Applicant  provided  sufficient  non-clinical  data  to  describe  ticagrelor  as  a  potent,  selective,  orally 
active,  direct  P2Y12  receptor  antagonist,  providing  mechanistic  support  for  its  utility  use  in  the 
prevention  of  secondary  cardiovascular  events  in  patients  with  ACS.  The  absorption,  distribution, 
metabolism and excretion of ticagrelor were well investigated in mouse, rat and marmoset and found 
mostly in line with the human situation. However, one question remains unresolved about the influence 
of ticagrelor on CYP2E1 and will be handled as a follow up measure. The Applicant provided extensive 
data  on  single  and  repeat-dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  and  reproductive  toxicity. 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  tests  showed  gastrointestinal  effects  in  mouse,  rat  and  marmoset,  of  which 
relevance for humans cannot be excluded. Ticagrelor is not genotoxic, however, some carcinogenicity 
at high dose was seen in liver and uterus of female rats, which is probably not relevant for humans. At 
high  dose  some  signs  of  reproductive  toxicity  were  shown.  Immunotoxicity,  impurities  and 
phototoxicity do not pose problems. Ticagrelor does not pose an unacceptable risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view  there  were  no  objections  to  a  marketing  authorization  of  ticagrelor. 
There  is  however  the  pharmacokinetic  issue  that  needs  to  be  resolved  as  a  follow  up  measure  given 
that  based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  Applicant,  it  can  not  be  excluded,  that  CYP2E1  is  involved  in 
the metabolism of ticagrelor.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  clinical  development  program  of  ticagrelor  comprises  41  phase  I  and  two  phase  II  clinical 
pharmacology (PK and/or PD) studies, two phase II dose selection studies and a single pivotal phase 
III trial in over 18,000 ACS patients. A second phase III trial is planned to evaluate the benefit/risk of 
ticagrelor  on  top  of  aspirin  in  patients  with  a  history  of  ACS.  An  overview  of  the  clinical  program  is 
provided below.  
Scientific advice by EMA was provided: EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/330223/2005 and EMEA/51999/2006.  
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Outlined  in  the  table  below,  there  were  2  phase  II  clinical  pharmacology  PK/PD  studies  and  2  dose-
finding studies evaluating efficacy and safety of several doses. In addition, one pivotal efficacy/safety 
study has been conducted up to 12  months and one long-term study is planned for treatment longer 
EMA/7143/2011

than  12  months.  The  data  from  this  study  will  be  provided  for  review  by  the  CHMP  within  agreed 
timeframes as a post-approval commitment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Ticagrelor is an entirely synthetic new chemical entity which binds reversibly to the P2Y12 platelet ADP 
receptor. Ticagrelor has a relative low solubility. Pharmacokinetic data was derived from a total of 21 
phase I studies including 575 volunteers and 2 phase II studies including 219 patients. In addition to 
the  21  phase  1  studies,  15  studies  have  been  performed  on  drug-drug  interactions  with  ticagrelor. 
Population  PK  analysis  for  ticagrelor  and  its  major  metabolite,  AR-C124910XX,  was  conducted  using 
data  from  the  Phase  IV  studies  D5130C00002  (DISPERSE2)  and  Study  D5130C05262  (PLATO), 
including data of 7090 subjects. 
Absorption 
At least 56% (26% excretion in urine and 30% excretion of radioactivity in the form of metabolites in 
faeces) of ticagrelor is absorbed. Ticagrelor is absorbed throughout the whole small intestine, although 
absorption decreases further down the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability for ticagrelor 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 20/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
was  approximately  36%.  This  is  consistent  with  the  estimated  fraction  absorbed  >56%  based  on  the 
excretion data. Higher metabolite: parent ratios for Cmax and AUC after oral administration versus IV 
administration  indicate  that  the  majority  of  AR-C124910XX  formation  occurs  during  first  pass 
metabolism. No clinically relevant food effect was observed for ticagrelor. 
Bioequivalence 
The  ticagrelor  tablets  manufactured  at  a  commercial-scale  facility  in  Gartuna  Sweden  (tablets  to  be 
marketed)  were  bioequivalent  to  those  manufactured  in  a  pilot-scale  plant  in  Charnwood  UK,  used  in 
phase  III  studies.  Bridging  between  the  different  formulations  used  during  clinical  development  was 
done. The mannitol-based tablets had a a 17% higher AUC than the lactose-based tablets. Tablets with 
micronized ticagrelor were bioequivalent to tablets with non-micronized ticagrelor.  
Distribution 
Ticagrelor has a steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 87.5 L. This indicates that it does 
not extensively distribute into or bind to tissues. Both ticagrelor and its primary active metabolite bind 
extensively  (>99.7%)  to  plasma  proteins.  Age,  gender,  severe  renal  impairment,  and  mild  hepatic 
impairment  do  not  affect  protein  binding.  The  mean  radioactivity  plasma/blood  ratio  was  1.69.  The 
distribution across the placenta and during lactation was not investigated in humans. 
Elimination  
For  ticagrelor  a  total  of  10  metabolites  are  characterized  from  urine,  faeces,  and  plasma.  Total 
recovery  upon  oral  administration  of  a  radioactive  ticagrelor  dose  was  84.3%  (26.5%  in  urine  and 
57.8%  in  faeces).  Unchanged  ticagrelor  found  in  faeces  was  measured  to  be  27%.  Radioactive 
components  in  faeces  and  plasma  were  identified  as  ticagrelor  and  its  active  metabolite  AR-
C124910XX. Major components in urine were metabolite ARC133913XX and its glucuronide conjugate. 
Recoveries  of  unchanged  ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX in  urine  were  both  less  than  1%  of  the  dose, 
indicating  that  both  compounds  are  extensively  metabolised  and  that  renal  impairment  might  have 
little effect on systemic exposure to ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
After loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor in the phase II studies with patients the Cmax of ticagrelor and 
AR-C124910XX were approximately 1200 and 240 ng/mL. The AUC0-8 of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX 
were approximately 5000 and 1200 ng h/mL. At steady state, at the clinical proposed dose of 90 mg 
bd ticagrelor, the C max of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX after last maintenance dose was approximately 
750 and 210 ng/mL. The AUC0-8 of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were approximately 4000 and 1325 
ng  h/mL.  Ticagrelor  pharmacokinetics  were  dose-proportional  up  to  a  daily  dose  of  600  mg.  Inter-
individual  variability  of  systemic  exposure  of  ticagrelor  is  relatively  low  with  coefficients  of  variation 
ranging  from  16%-44%.  The  intra-individual  variability  is  approximately  20%  for  AUC  and  30%  for 
C max and similar between patients and healthy subjects. 
Special populations  
Severe  renal  impairment  did  not  significantly  influence  the  AUC  and  Cmax  of  ticagrelor  and  AR-
C124910XX,  as  is  expected  in  light  of  the  small  amount  excreted  renally.  Plasma  protein  binding  of 
ticagrelor  and  its  metabolites  are  not  altered  in  renally  impaired  volunteers.  Mild  hepatic  impairment 
did  not  clinically  significantly  influence  the  AUC  and  C max  of  ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX.  Ticagrelor 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 21/50 
 
  
 
 
has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment;  therefore  ticagrelor  is 
contraindicated  in  these  patients.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX  are  not 
clinically significantly influenced by smoking, weight or race. Exposure to ticagrelor in patients over 75 
years is about 21% (males) and 25% (females) higher than in those less than 65 years old. This is not 
considered a clinically relevant difference. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro studies showed that ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX have no or low potential to induce CYP1A1, 
CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2B6  and  CYP3A4.  In  vitro  studies  showed  that  ticagrelor  and  AR-C124910XX 
have the potential to moderately inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 activities. Additionally 
it  was  shown  that  ticagrelor  showed  no  propensity  to  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C19 
CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. Ticagrelor may affect substrates transported by Pgp, URAT1 or OAT3. 
Several clinical interaction studies were performed. 
Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased ticagrelor C max by 2.4-fold and AUC by 7.3 fold, and 
decreased  AR-C124910XX  Cmax  by  89%  and  AUC  by  56%.  Concomitant  administration  of  strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors with ticagrelor is contraindicated in the SPC. 
Rifampicin  (CYP3A  inducer)  decreased  ticagrelor  C max  by  73%  and  AUC  by  86%.  In  section  4.5  is 
mentioned that rifampicin and other CYP3A4 inducers would be expected to decrease the exposure to 
ticagrelor  and  may  result  in  reduced  efficacy  of  ticagrelor.  Although  ticagrelor  is  still  beneficial  in 
combination with CYP3A4 inducers, the rates of primary efficacy events are higher in patients treated 
with  potent  CYP3A4  inducers  at  some  time  during  randomisation  versus  those  who  did  not  receive 
concomitant  CYP3A4  inducers  (12.5%  vs.  8.8%  in  the  ticagrelor  group).  The  Applicant  includes  a 
warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  regarding  concomitant  treatment  of  ticagrelor  with  potent  CYP3A4 
inducers.  
Simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) concomitant administration with ticagrelor increased both simvastatin 
C max  and  AUC  by  81%  and  56%,  respectively. Simvastatin  acid  Cmax  and AUC was increased  by  64% 
and  52%,  respectively.  Some  individual  increases  of  2-  to  3-fold  were  observed.  Therefore, 
consideration should be given especially to changes on simvastatin exposure in patients requiring more 
than  40  mg  of  simvastatin,  in  light  of  the  possible  higher  chance  of  developing  rhabdomyolysis  as  is 
expressed in the SPC. Interactions with other statins metabolised by CYP 3A4 cannot be excluded. 
Digoxin  (P-glycoprotein  substrate)  concomitant  administration  with  ticagrelor  increased  mean  trough 
digoxin  levels  about  30%,  with  some  individual  maximum  increases  about  200%.  Ticagrelor 
pharmacokinetics were unaffected. Other P-gp substrate drugs might have similar exposure changes in 
the  presence  of  ticagrelor.  According  to  the  Applicant  appropriate  clinical  or  laboratory  monitoring  is 
recommended  when  giving  the  narrow  therapeutic index,  P-gp-dependent  drug  digoxin  concomitantly 
with ticagrelor as is expressed in section 4.5 of the SPC. 
Diltiazem  (moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor)  did  not  significantly  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
ticagrelor, however the slight increase in bleeding risk was observed.  
Co-administration  with  ticagrelor  did  not  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  atorvastatin  (CYP3A4 
substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A4/3A5 substrate) to a clinically significant degree. No interaction was 
observed between tolbutamide, a CYP2C9 substrate and ticagrelor. This result can be extrapolated to 
other CYP2C9 substrates but not to the coumarin derivatives as a pharmacodynamic interaction might 
occur.  Ticagrelor  did  not  clinically  significantly  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  levonorgestrel  and 
ethinylestradiol.  Contraceptive  efficacy  is  expected  to  be  unchanged  when  co-administered  with 
ticagrelor. The pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and its metabolite AR-C124910XX were unaltered by co-
EMA/7143/2011

administration  midazolam,  atorvastatin,  ASA,  heparin,  enoxoparin,  and  desmopressin.  ASA,  heparin, 
enoxoparin, and desmopressin do not have an influence on the plasma protein binding of ticagrelor and 
AR-C124910XX.  No  interactions  were  observed  in  population  PK  evaluation  when  ticagrelor  is  used 
concomitantly  with  nitrates  or  proton  pump  inhibitors.  The  interaction  with  P  glycoprotein  substrates 
was  evaluated  using  population  PK  data  concerning  the  concomitant  use  of  ticagrelor  and  verapamil, 
the exposure to ticagrelor is slightly higher (30-40%) in this population. As the data on verapamil do 
not allow discerning between an interaction due to inhibition of CYP3A or inhibition of P-gp transporting 
system,  and  P-glycoprotein  interactions  are  known  to  be  bi-directional  an  additional  DDI  with  a  P-
glycoprotein substrate with a narrow therapeutic index is warranted. This study will be conducted as a 
post-approval commitment (FUM 4). 
Ticagrelor  is  a  CYP2D6  inhibitor  in  vitro,  but  interaction  studies  with  substrates  of  CYP2D6  have  not 
been conducted. At least one DDI study with a CYP2D6 substrate should be conducted and this study 
will be presented as post approval commitment (FUM 3). 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ticagrelor is a member of the chemical class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines (CPTP), which is a selective 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist acting on the P2Y12 ADP-receptor that can prevent 
ADP-mediated  platelet  activation  and  aggregation.  Ticagrelor  is  orally  active,  and  reversibly  interacts 
with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor. Ticagrelor does not interact with the ADP binding site itself, but 
interacts with platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  main  studies  encompassing  the  clinical  pharmacodynamic  evaluation  were  the  OFFSET  and 
RESPOND trials.  
The  OFFSET  trial  evaluated  the  onset  and  offset  of  ticagrelor  in  comparison  to  clopidgrel.  Ticagrelor 
demonstrates  a  rapid  onset  of  effect,  with  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation  (IPA)  statistically 
significant  at  all  times  (0.5  hours  to  max  respons  at  8  hours)  with  ticagrelor  180  mg  compared  to 
clopidogrel 600 mg. Onset of maximum %IPA was higher for ticagrelor than clopidogrel (appr. 85% vs 
50%).  The  slope  of  the  offset  curve  of  ticagrelor  is  significantly  different  from  the  offset  curve  of 
clopidogrel ((–1.037 vs –0.482% per hour; p < 0.0001). Because mean final extent %IPA was higher 
for  ticagrelor  90  mg  compared  with  the  clopidogrel  75  mg,  IPA  was  higher  before  the  24  hour  time 
point and started to be significantly lower thereafter, with levels approaching baseline after 5 days for 
ticagrelor and 7 days for clopidogrel (see Figure 1).  
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 23/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Figure 1 Mean final extent %IPA induced by 20 μM ADP after the last dose ±SE by protocol time (ITT 
analysis set) 
The  RESPOND  trial  evaluated  whether  switching  from  clopidogrel  to  ticagrelor  or  visa  versa  in 
responders  or  non-responders  to  clopidogrel  would  result  in  a  different  extent  of inhibition  of  platelet 
aggregation.  This  design  failed  to  show  a  statistical  significant  difference  between  ticagrelor  and 
clopidogrel  for  the  primary  evaluation  of  the  proportion  of  non-responders  becoming  responders 
(achieving  >10%  IPA;  similar  or  less  than  10%IPA  was  defined  as  non-responders)  after  switching 
from  clopidogrel  to  ticagrelor.  However,  this  resulted  in  a  higher  %IPA  (26.6%-36.6%).  Responders 
switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor at steady state dose showed a mean 26.4% increase in %IPA. 
Conversely, switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, responders had a mean 24.5% decrease in %IPA. 
The  50,  100,  200  and  400  mg  dose  were  evaluated  in  200  patients  for  relation  between  plasma 
concentration  and  effect  for  single  dose  and  steady  state.  Maximum  IPA  was  found  to  reach  plateau 
from Cmax and UAC corresponding to 100 mg dose and higher. 
The  pharmacodynamic  interaction  of  ticagrelor  with  ASA,  heparin  and  enoxaparin  was  evaluated  as 
secondary  endpoints  in  3  separate  small  studies  in  respectively  16,  30  and  30  patients.  Inhibition  of 
ADP-induced  platelet  aggregation  was  not  affected  by  300  mg  of  ASA  co-administered  for  both 
ticagrelor  doses  of  50  and  200  mg.  However,  bleeding  times  were  longer  with  the  co-administration 
with ASA. 
The  results  for  IPA  were  not  statistically  significantly  different  between  ticagrelor  with  and  without 
heparin,  except  final  extent  IPAmax  and  AUEC2-12  (Area  under  the  effect  curve)  were  slightly 
decreased  (4.0%  and  7.3%,  respectively),  and  maximum  extent  IPAmax  was  slightly  decreased 
(4.0%) when heparin was co-administered with ticagrelor. 
Ticagrelor  (180  mg)  with  and  without  enoxaparin  (1  mg/kg  subcutaneous)  showed  similar 
concentration-effect profiles and parameter estimates for ticagrelor with and without enoxaparin.

Genetic differences in PD response were evaluated in 71 patients (28 clopidogrel non-responders and 
43  responders)  from  the  RESPOND  trial.  No  statistically  significant  differences  could  be  observed  in 
both  ticagrelor  90  mg  and  clopidogrel  75  mg  for  categories  of  extensive  metabolisers,  median 
metabolisers, and poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 for pharmacological response of platelet aggregation 
and inhibition of platelet aggregation. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ticagrelor demonstrated a dose response relation with a maximum effect between 100 mg and 200 mg 
dose at both single and steady state dosing. The minimum dose of platelet inhibition has not been well 
identified,  since  the  Applicant  was  targeting  to  identify  the  maximum  dose.  Further  studies  were 
conducted  with  the  90mg  dose  due  to  supra-bioavailability  of  the  new  dose  form.  In  a  study  in  non-
responders  to  clopidogrel  it  was  not  directly  apparent  that  the  switch  from  clopidogrel  to  ticagrelor 
would  result  in  more  patients  responding  as  the  number  of  patients  with  >10%  IPA  was  not 
significantly different between clopidogrel and ticagrelor. However, maximum IPA% was increased with 
26.6%-36.6% when switching from clopidogrel non-responders to ticagrelor. The offset of inhibition of 
platelet  aggregation  is  faster  with  ticagrelor  than  with  clopidogrel  according  to  data  on  markers  of 
platelet  inhibition.  However,  as  with  the  proposed  dose  of  ticagrelor  the  inhibition  of  platelet 
aggregation  is  higher  and  the  level  at  drug  discontinuation  is  thus  higher.  Despite  this  higher  start 
level  at  drug  discontinuation  the  complete  offset  is  5  days  instead  of  7  days  with  ticagrelor  vs. 
clopidogrel based on ADP induced platelet inhibition. However, as IPA is not always considered a good 
marker for bleeding risk in the clinical situation also other markers were evaluated. With markers of Hb 
concentration and chest tube drainage, no difference in offset of bleeding risk could be shown between 
ticagrelor  and  clopidogrel.  Any  statements  on  less  variability  based  on  metabolic  differences  between 
ticagrelor  compared  to  clopidogrel  are  not  justified  based  on  genetic  differences.  Although  a  trend 
towards less efficacy and more major bleeding with ticagrelor in extensive metabolisers cannot fully be 
excluded, no statistically significant interaction was observed.  
With the administration of warfarin or NSAID’s no clear impact of an increased incidence of bleedings 
was observed. However, with the addition of SSRI’s a higher incidence of major + minor bleedings was 
observed.  Still,  this  potential  mechanistic  interaction  with  oral  anticoagulants,  SSRI’s  and  NSAID’s  is 
specifically addressed in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant used inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) as the method to demonstrate anticoagulant 
efficacy,  although  the  relevance  to  clinical  effect  is  sometimes  questioned.  It  was  demonstrated  that 
the optimal dose would be between 100 and 200 mg. Switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor results in 
an  increase  in  IPA,  albeit  not  in  a  significant  change  in  subjects  defined  as  responders.  The  claimed 
faster  offset  based  on  IPA  can  be  questioned,  as  other  markers  showed  similar  offset  results  as  with 
clopidogrel.  
2.5. Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1 Dose response studies 
Dose response is evaluated in the DISPERSE and DISPERSE2 trials.  
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 25/50 
 
  
 
 
The  DISPERSE  trial  was  a  28-day  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel  group, 
multicentre study mainly comparing the PD and PK of several doses of ticagrelor (50 mg bd, 100 mg 
bd,  200  mg  bd  and  400  mg  od)  plus  ASA  with  clopidogrel  (75  mg  od)  plus  ASA,  in  subjects  with 
documented  atherosclerotic  disease.  A  starting  dose  of  ticagrelor  demonstrated  more  platelet 
aggregation inhibition than clopidogrel for all ticagrelor doses, expressed as %IPA. 
At  steady  state  (day  14  or  28)  ticagrelor  50  mg  bd  resulted  in  platelet  aggregation  inhibition 
comparable to clopidogrel 75 mg od; higher doses produced greater inhibition of platelet aggregation 
than  clopidogrel,  with  little  difference  in  the  level  of  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation  between  these 
higher doses of ticagrelor. A dose dependency for the total number of AEs was observed for ticagrelor 
(58, 63, 73 and 88 AEs for AZD6140 doses of 50, 100, 200 bd and 400 mg od, respectively). Although 
mean  bleeding  times  were  longer  for  all  ticagrelor dose  levels  compared  to  clopidogrel,  there  was  no 
simple dose relationship and considerable variability in individual data was observed.  
The  second  DISPERSE2  trial  was  a  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel  group,  randomised, 
multicentre study comparing the safety and tolerability of 2 doses of ticagrelor (90 and 180 mg) with 
clopidogrel 75 mg (all in combination with ASA) in 990 patients with non-ST segment elevation ACS (in 
the previous 48h). The cumulative total bleeding event rate appeared higher for the ticagrelor 90 mg 
bd group over the first 6 weeks than the other 2 groups, but this difference was not maintained over 
the remainder of the study. At week 4, adjudicated bleeding event rates for major fatal/life threatening 
and  major  other  bleeding  events  were  similar  for  all  groups.  An  apparent  dose-related  trend  towards 
an  increase  in  minor  bleeds  was  observed:  ticagrelor  90  mg  bd  9  (2.7%),  ticagrelor  180  mg  bd  12 
(3.7%) and clopidogrel 75 mg 4 (1.2%) patients. The number of patients experiencing dyspnoea in the 
ticagrelor 90 mg bd and 180 mg bd groups, was 26 (8%) and 38 (12%), respectively and greater than 
clopidogrel 75 mg od with 15 (5%) patients.  
There  appeared  to  be  a  small  increase  in  the  numbers  of  patients  with  arrhythmias  reported  in  the 
ticagrelor  groups.  Although  in  the  Holter  substudy,  in  total,  24%  patients  experienced  episodes  of 
ischaemia  ≥1.0  mm  ST  depression  or  elevation  on  Holter  monitoring,  there  were  no  apparent 
differences between the treatment groups. 
2.5.2 Main study 
Title of Study 
PLATO (PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes) 
Methods 
This  was  a  18  624  patients  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group,  phase  III,  efficacy  and  safety 
trial, that compared ticagrelor to clopidogrel for prevention of vascular events in patients with non-ST 
or  ST-  elevation  ACS.  The  trial  enrolled  a  population  of  patients  with  ACS  (UA,  NSTEMI,  STEMI), 
including  patients  planned  for  invasive  management,  i.e.  coronary  angiography  with  PCI  or  CABG,  as 
well  as  patients  intended  for  medical  management.  The  duration  of  treatment  ranged  from  6  to  12 
months  with  planned  study  completion  at  6,  9  and  12  months  depending  on  the  date  the  patients 
entered the study according to the following study design: 
EMA/7143/2011

Figure 2 PLATO study design. 
Study Participants 
Patients were included within 24 hour presentation of ST segment elevation ACS, or non-ST elevation 
ACS  and  additional  markers  of  possible  ACS  such  as  troponin  or  CK-MB  elevations,  and/or  additional 
CAD risk factors in a way that this would mostly reflect clinical diagnostic decision making.  
Patients  were  excluded  mainly  based  on  bleeding  risk  (if  they  had  a  known  bleeding  incidence  within 
last 6 months or elevated bleeding risk, oral anticoagulation therapy that could not be stopped, current 
or  planned  fibrinolytic  therapy),  based  on  close  to  randomisation  ACS  risk,  increased  risk  of 
bradycardic  events,  and  metabolic  associated  problems  (moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment, 
strong CYP3A inhibitors, CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, or strong CYP3A inducers). 
Treatments 
All  patients  were  treated  with  concomitant  ASA  75  to  100  mg  daily  in  addition  to  randomised  study 
medication  during  the  treatment  period,  according  to  local  practice,  unless  they  were  allergic  or 
intolerant to ASA.

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel 
for the prevention of vascular events in patients with non-ST or ST elevation ACS.  
The secondary objectives were: 
1. To assess the safety and tolerability of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. 
2.  To  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ticagrelor  compared  with  clopidogrel  in  those  patients  who 
underwent CABG surgery or PCI during the study and in relation to the timing of these interventions.  
3.  To  assess  the  occurrence  of  arrhythmic  episodes  detected  by  Holter  monitoring  with  ticagrelor 
compared  with  clopidogrel  both  during  the  initial  period  after  randomisation  and  at  1  month  and  the 
relation of these episodes to clinical outcomes.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary efficacy  endpoint was  time  to  first  occurrence  of  any  event  from  the  composite  of  death 
from vascular causes, MI and stroke. 
The  following  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  in  the  order  presented  using  a  hierarchical 
procedure:  the  primary  endpoint  for  patients  with  intent  for  invasive  management;  endpoint  of  all-
cause  mortality,  MI,  and  stroke;  composite  of  death  from  vascular  causes,  MI  (including  silent  MI  by 
ECG),  stroke,  severe  recurrent  cardiac  ischaemia  (SRI),  recurrent  cardiac  ischaemia  (RI),  transient 
ischaemic  attack  (TIA)  and  other  arterial  thrombotic  events  (ATEs);  each  component  of  the  primary 
composite efficacy endpoint in the order of MI, death from vascular causes and then stroke; all-cause 
mortality. As part of the secondary efficacy endpoints, a supportive analysis was conducted examining 
the  primary  endpoint  following  PCI  in  patients  with  planned  invasive  management  who  received  PCI 
within  24  hours  of  randomisation.  This  is  most  critical  in  patients  with  STEMI  with  a  totally  occluded 
coronary vessel who undergo immediate primary PCI. 
The primary safety endpoint was time to first occurrence of any total major bleeding event. 
Sample size 
Based on an expected event rate in the clopidogrel treatment arm of 11% over 12 months (Mehta et al 
2000;  Yusuf  et  al  2001),  approximately  1780  events  in  the  primary  composite  endpoint  would  yield 
90% power to detect a target RRR of 13.5%, accounting for study medication discontinuations. 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 28/50 
 
 
  
 
 
Randomisation 
At  Visit  1  (randomisation)  eligible  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  1  of  2  treatment  groups, 
ticagrelor 90 mg bd or clopidogrel 75 mg od, taken orally. 
Randomisation  and  treatment  pack  assignment  was  managed  via  the  central  Interactive  Voice 
Response System (IVRS) or Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) and patients took the first dose 
of  study  medication  directly  after  randomisation  at  Visit  1.  Patients  took  subsequent  maintenance 
doses  in  the  morning  and  evening,  at  approximately  12-hour  intervals,  for  the  remainder  of  the 
treatment period. 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding was secured by treating each treatment group with the same combination of matching active 
and placebo tablets and matching active and placebo capsules (the same number, size and packaging 
of the tablets and capsules). 
Statistical methods 
One  formal  interim  analysis  of  the  primary  composite  efficacy  endpoint  was  planned  when 
approximately  1200  adjudicated  events  (2/3rds  of  the  total  target  number  of  1780  events)  were 
observed.  The  interim  analysis  was  guided  by  the  Peto-Haybittle  group  sequential  boundary 
corresponding  to  a  critical  p-value  of  0.001.  To  maintain  the  overall  significance  level  at  5%,  the 
critical  p-value  at  the  final  analysis was  0.0497.  The  intention-to-treat  approach  for  efficacy  analyses 
utilised  the  Full  Analysis  Set,  consisting  of  all  patients  randomised  to  study  treatment,  for  their 
duration of participation in PLATO. The primary analysis employed Cox proportional hazards of time to 
event  with  treatment  group  as  factor.  The  formal  hierarchical  analysis  pre-specified  the  order  of 
consideration for secondary endpoints, thus controlling the experiment-wise type I error.

Results  
Participant flow 
Figure 3 Participant flow in PLATO 
Conduct of the study 
PLATO,  a  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel  group,  international,  multicentre  study, 
compared the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor 90 mg bd with clopidogrel 75 mg od in the prevention of 
CV  death,  MI,  and  stroke  in  patients  with  non-ST  or  ST  elevation  ACS.  The  duration  of  treatment 
ranged from 6 to 12 months with planned study completion at 6, 9 and 12 months depending on the 
date  the  patients  entered  the  study  (e.g.,  patients  that  entered  towards  the  end  of  the  enrolment 
period  would  have  the  shortest  duration  of  treatment).  An  interim  analysis  was  performed  when 
approximately 1200 adjudicated events were available. The double-dummy design enabled the blinding 
to  be  maintained  because  the  study  used  an  active  comparator  with  a  different  dosing  regimen  than 
that  used  for  ticagrelor  as  well  as  independent  modification  of  dosing  in  advance  of  surgical 
procedures. 
Baseline data 
Patients were properly randomised and presented the following baseline characteristics: male (72%), a 
gender  distribution  typical  for  ACS;  57.1%  of  patients  were  <65  years  and  42.8%  were  ≥65  years, 
predominantly  Caucasian,  wide  range  of  global  regions  and  countries:  Europe,  Middle  East  and  Africa 
(74.2%; of which 94% were within Europe alone), North America (9.9%), Asia and Australia (9.2%), 
EMA/7143/2011

and Central and South America (6.7%); 66% hypertension, 45% AP, 20% MI, 47% dyslipidemia, and 
25% DM2.  
Numbers analysed 
The  full  analysis  set  is  9333  patients  for  ticagrelor  and  9291  patients  for  clopidogrel.  The  safety 
analysis set (received >1 dose study drug) was 9235 (98.9%) and 9186 (98.9%), respectively.  
Outcomes and estimation 
For the primary endpoint (CV death, MI, and stroke), ticagrelor demonstrated a relative lower risk of 
16% and an absolute risk reduction of 1.9% over 12 months in patients with ACS events (UA, NSTEMI 
and STEMI) compared to clopidogrel (HR 0.84; p=0.0003) (see figure 3). This can be reflected in the 
NNT of treating 54 patients with ticagrelor instead of with clopidogrel for 12 months preventing 1 event 
in the primary composite outcome. A beneficial effect was already significant from day 30 onwards (HR 
0.88; p=0.0446). 
Ticagrelor,  compared  to  clopidogrel,  was  shown  to  decrease  separately  the  rates  of  cardiovascular 
death  (4.0%  vs  5.1%;  HR  0.79  (95%  CI  0.69,  0.91);  p=0.0013,  ARR  1.1%,)  and  of  MI  (5.8%  vs 
6.9%; HR 0.84 (95% CI 0.75, 0.95); p=0.0045, ARR 1.1%), but not that of stroke (1.5% vs 1.3%; HR 
1.17 (95% CI 0.91-1.52) p=0.2249). All cause mortality was also significantly reduced (HR 0.78 (95% 
CI 0.69, 0.89); p=0.0003).

occurrence of any event in the composite efficacy endpoint

In  patients  who  actually  received  a  PCI  within  24  hours  of  randomisation,  ticagrelor  demonstrated  a 
beneficial statistically significant primary efficacy effect (HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.74, 0.99); p=0.0305).  
Patients who were treated with PCI as first procedure showed a HR of 0.88 (p=0.04).  
Medically treated patients (non-invasive as first procedure) had the highest benefit with an HR of 0.78 
(p=0.0006), and demonstrated a lower bleeding risk. 
Ancillary analyses 
The  treatment  effect  of  ticagrelor  over  clopidogrel  appears  consistent  across  multiple  patient 
subgroups by demographic characteristics and by final index event diagnosis (UA, NSTEMI and STEMI) 
(see Figure 4). A significant p value for interaction was found for region (p=0.045), weight by gender-
specific  median  (p=0.038),  and  baseline  lipid  lowering  drug  use  (p=0.039).  For  patients  not  treated 
with a lipid lowering drug a point estimate of 1.02 (non-significant) was found.  
Figure 5 Treatment effect according to subgroups 
Further  evaluation  of  the  region  by  treatment  interaction  showed  that  the  North  America  observation 
was  driven  primarily  by  results  in  the  United  States  (HR  1.27  (95%  CI  0.92,  1.75)).  These  analyses 
suggest a possible association between ASA dose and the primary efficacy results, such that reduced 
efficacy was observed with ticagrelor at increasing doses of ASA. AHA/ACC Guideline recommendations 
for ASA in patients receiving a stent, state that a dose of 325 mg od should be administered (King et al 
2007) for 6 months. In PLATO, this dose was predominantly administered to patients in North America. 
Only  16%  of  North  American  patients  taking  325  mg  ASA  had  the  dose  lowered  after  6  months 
(patients who were on the study for more than 6 months). Other regions predominantly adhered to the 
chronic  dose  of  75  mg  to  100  mg  od  ASA.  Additional  preclinical  mechanistic  work  is  underway  to 
explore the possible relationship between ASA dose and ticagrelor efficacy versus clopidogrel.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Following oral administration, 20% to 27% of the dose is excreted in the urine. One study specifically 
addressed the impact of severe renal impairment on ticagrelor exposure, and the estimated Cmax and 
AUC values were similar for subjects with and without severe renal impairment. For the PLATO study, 
an  additional  exploratory  efficacy  analysis  of  the  primary  clinical  endpoint  was  performed  in  patients 
with  defined  subgroups  of  baseline  renal  function.  There  was  no  statistically  significant  treatment 
interaction with baseline renal function, although patients with moderate and severe renal impairment 
demonstrated large point estimates for ARR, 5.7% and 9.5% respectively. The treatment benefit with 
ticagrelor  for  the  primary  clinical  endpoint  occurs  at  all  levels  of  baseline  renal  function.  The  clinical 
program did not study dialysis-dependent patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
Ticagrelor  is  extensively  metabolised,  and  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  3A4  is  thought  to  be  the  major 
enzyme  responsible  for  cytochrome  P450  mediated  metabolism  of  ticagrelor,  and  also  the  formation 
and metabolism of the major metabolite, AR-C124910XX. In the PLATO study, subjects with moderate 
or  severe  hepatic  impairment  were  not  to  be  included,  and  Phase  III  study  data  is  therefore  not 
available  for  this  population.  However,  one  study  specifically  addressed  the  impact  of  mild  hepatic 
impairment on ticagrelor exposure. Peak and overall exposure to ticagrelor were 12% and 23% higher 
in  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  A)  compared  to  matched  healthy 
volunteers.  Ticagrelor  has  not  been  studied  in  the  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C). 
2.5.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Ticagrelor  demonstrated  a  clear  beneficial  treatment  effect  for  the  primary  endpoint.  This  is  already 
apparent within the first 30 days of follow-up and remains consistent until the end of follow-up of 12 
months. CV death and MI are the main contributors of the composite primary endpoint, while ticagrelor 
does not demonstrate any beneficial treatment effect on the stroke endpoint, which only accounted for 
approximately 10% of the individual endpoints of the primary endpoint. The most important secondary 
endpoints  are  supportive  for  the  primary  endpoint,  including  all  cause  mortality.  Post  hoc  analyses 
demonstrate  ticagrelor  to  be  effective  in  both  subgroups  of  invasive  and  non-invasively  treated 
patients.  Ticagrelor  seems  to  be  most  effective in patients  who  are  managed  medically  (non-invasive 
as first procedure) compared to invasively treated (mainly PCI) although statistical interaction was not 
significant.  Benefit  risk  evaluation  in  both  STEMI  and  NSTEMI  seems  approximately  equally  effective 
with  ticagrelor  although  subgroup  differences  appear.  Further  subgroup  analyses  demonstrated  most 
subgroups  to  be  consistent  with  the  overall  analysis,  except  for  the  impact  of  region.  In  the  North 
American subpopulation ticagrelor performed worse than clopidogrel. According to the Applicant this is 
most  likely  related  to  the  higher  dose  of  ASA  administered.  Another  remarkable  finding  was  the 
observed benefit in mortality for patients undergoing CABG, but with no advantage over clopidogrel on 
the primary endpoint.  A particular point of interest is whether the relative beneficial effect of ticagrelor 
might be observed due to a possible lack of efficacy in patients who are poor clopidogrel metabolisers, 
either due to genetic polymorphism or due to concomitant use of CYP2C19 inhibitors. Nevertheless, PPI 
treatment  did  not  impact  overall  efficacy  of  ticagrelor  as  compared  to  clopidogrel.  However,  upon 
closer  inspection  it  can  be  noticed  that  for  CV  death  and  overall  death,  event  rates  were  larger  in 
patients in the clopidogrel treatment arm that concomitantly received PPI treatment versus those that 
did  not  take  PPI.  In  the  ticagrelor  arm  there  might  also  be  a  difference  between  PPI  users  and  non 
users as KM curves show a trend toward more endpoints in PPI users comparable to clopidogrel users. 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 33/50 
 
  
 
 
However, interpretation is complicated as it probably shows ‘confounding by indication’. Patients using 
PPIs  were  slightly  older  (0.4  years),  were  more  often  intended  for  invasive  management  (80%  vs 
68%), had  more often an index diagnosis of STEMI or NSTEMI vs UA/other, and were  more often on 
concomitant  statin  treatment.  In  addition,  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  ticagrelor  (pH 
independent absorption, no CYP2C19 activation) suggest that PPI interaction is unlikely.  
2.5.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Ticagrelor demonstrated a clear beneficial treatment effect for the primary endpoint with CV death and 
MI as the main contributors. This effect was also consistent for planned invasive management, and for 
NSTEMI  and  STEMI  patients.  However,  patients  managed  medically  seemed  to  have  a  better  benefit 
risk balance than patients treated invasively.   
2.6 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Nearly 10-fold more patients (9235 exposed for up to 12 months) received ticagrelor in PLATO than in 
all Phase II studies (960  exposed for  4 to 12 weeks) combined. Therefore, safety data  in PLATO was 
kept separate from those in earlier Phase I and II studies. 
Adverse events  
A  higher  overall  percentage  of  AEs  (72.7%  vs.  69.6%)  was  observed  with  treatment  of  ticagrelor 
compared  to  clopidogrel.  Although  severe  AEs  were  similar,  AEs  and  SAEs  led  to  more  study  drug 
discontinuations (7.4% vs. 5.4% and 2.8% vs. 2.4%). However, a sensivity analysis showed that this 
did not affect net clinical benefit. 
When bleeding events were excluded, a higher number of AEs (68.6% vs. 66.6%) still remained in the 
ticagrelor  group  as  compared  to  the  clopidogrel  group.  However,  numerically  fewer  SAEs  (1633 
(17.7%) vs. 1694 (18.4%)) and deaths (198 (2.1%) vs. 266 (2.9%)) were observed in the ticagrelor 
group  as  compared  to  the  clopidogrel  group.  Numerically,  more  patients  discontinued  therapy  as  a 
result of adverse events (486 (5.3%) vs. 411 (4.5%)) in the ticagrelor group relative to the clopidogrel 
group (table 2). 
Most  common  AEs  with  a  higher  incidence  for  ticagrelor  were  dyspnoea  (1104  (12.0%)  vs.  598

The primary safety endpoint was defined as time to first occurrence of any total major bleeding event, 
which was found to be higher but non-statistically significant for ticagrelor (11.6% vs. 11.2%; HR 1.04 
(95%CI 0.90-1.16); p=0.4336). This was irrespective of PLATO or TIMI-defined bleedings. 
Differentiation  across  major  fatal  and  life-threatening  bleedings  did  also  not  demonstrate  any 
differences.  However,  a  statistically  significant  higher  incidence  of  bleedings  for  ticagrelor  was  found 
when  major  and  minor  bleedings  were  combined  (16.1%  vs  14.6%;  HR  1.11  (95%CI  1.03-1.20); 
p=0.0084). 
More  non-procedure-related  bleedings  appeared  in  the  ticagrelor  group  (2.5%  vs  2.0%;  HR  1.31 
95%CI 1.08-1.60) while procedural bleedings seemed generally lower with ticagrelor (8.2% vs 8.4%) 
except for PCI-related procedures (1.0% vs. 0.7%) (see table 2). 
Table 5 Major bleeding events by clinical context 
For  non-procedural  major  bleedings,  gastro-intestinal  bleedings  and  intracranial  bleedings  were  most 
frequent. Despite an increase in intracranial total major fatal/life-threatening bleedings, there was no 
increase  in  non-intracranial  total  major  fatal/life-threatening  bleedings  with  ticagrelor  (5.0%  with 
ticagrelor and 5.1% with clopidogrel). 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 35/50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Incidence  of  procedural  and  CABG-related  bleedings  was  lower  with  ticagrelor.  In  contrast  to  what 
would be expected based on pharmacological platelet inhibition, there was a higher incidence in total 
major and fatal/life threatening bleeding events for ticagrelor when study drug was discontinued within 
96  hours  prior  to  CABG.  A  longer  period  between  discontinuation  and  invasive  treatment  resulted  in 
fewer  bleedings  with  ticagrelor  (see  table  6).  Bleeding  risk  was  not  lower  for  ticagrelor  compared  to 
clopidogrel until 7 days before treatment discontinuation before CABG. 
Table 6 PLATO-defined ‘Major Fatal/Life-threatening’ CABG-related bleeding by time from last dose of 
study drug to procedure  
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  total  major  (CABG  included)  bleedings,  only  demonstrated  a  significantly 
higher  incidence  for  the  BMI  >=  30  kg/m2  group  (HR  1.21  (1.02,  1.45))  as  compared  to  HR  0.99 
(0.89, 1.09) for the BMI <30 k g/ m2 subgroup.  
For  the  total  major  CABG  excluded  bleedings  (overall  significant  increase  of  bleedings),  the  following 
subgroups  demonstrated  a  significantly  higher  incidence:  age  group  >=65  and  <75  years,  male, 
Caucasian,  BMI  >=  30  kg/m2,  weight  >=  60  kg,  no  diabetes  mellitus,  CYP3A4  use,  no  glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa use, ASA use, Heparin use, no history of TIA/Non-Haem stroke. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Both  treatment  groups  demonstrated  similar  profiles  of  severe  AEs  (20.2%  vs.  20.3%)  according  to 
organ class with the exception of gastro-intestinal disorders (2.4% vs. 1.9%). The overall numbers of 
deaths were smaller among the ticagrelor treated patients (443 vs, 540). This also applied for numbers 
of deaths on treatment (283 (3.1%) vs. 339 (3.7%)). Bleeding deaths were similar (0.2%) in the two 
groups.  
Laboratory findings 
Approximately  5%  of  ticagrelor  treated  patients  experienced  a  decrease  in  haemoglobin  from  normal 
at baseline to low that crossed the lower limit of the reference range (115 g/L for males or 105 g/L for 
females) versus approximately 4% of clopidogrel patients. Increases in mean serum creatinine values 
of  less  than  10%  relative  to  baseline  were  observed  in  both  treatment  groups,  with  a  numerically 
greater increase in patients receiving ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. Elevated serum creatinine 
has been identified as a  potential risk further to be evaluated in the PEGASUS trial, as a mechanistic 
EMA/7143/2011

study  seems  not  feasible.  Renal  events  in  patients  with  elevated  serum  creatinine  were  higher, 
however,  more  CV  events  occurred  in  both  groups  in  patients  with  >50%  creatinine  elevation. 
Monitoring of renal function is needed and this is stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Mean serum uric 
acid  increased  approximately  15%  from  baseline  for  ticagrelor  vs  approximately  7%  for  clopidogrel. 
Absolute  values  and  change  from  baseline in  serum ALT,  AST,  ALP,  and  total  bilirubin were  generally 
similar  over  time  for  the  ticagrelor  and  clopidogrel  treatment  groups,  and  there  was  a  similar 
frequency of liver function test abnormalities in the 2 treatment groups. However, an imbalance in the 
number of patients with bilirubin increase >2xULN (ticagrelor 25 vs clopidogrel 10) was noticed. These 
cases  often  represented  a  moderate  hyperbilirubinaemia  with  a  mild  contribution  of  conjugated 
bilirubin  (<20%)  without  signs  of  cholestasis  or  hepatocellular  liver  injury.  Of  the  patients  with 
available  samples  for  genotyping,  most  were  homozygous  for  UGT1A1  polymorphisms  known  to  be 
associated to Gilbert’s Syndrome. Also the PEGASUS trial should elucidate more on liver safety. 
Safety in special populations 
Specific AEs 
Dyspnoea  SAEs  were  reported  in  69  patients  (0.7%)  taking  ticagrelor  and  39  patients  (0.4%)  taking 
clopidogrel.  Most  of  the  dyspnoea  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  nature;  severe  dyspnoea  AEs  were 
identified  in  35  patients  (0.4%)  in  the  ticagrelor  group  and  18  patients  (0.2%)  in  the  clopidogrel 
group. There were 2 dyspnoea AEs with an outcome of death (1 in each treatment group). 
The number  of patients with AEs in the cardiac arrhythmias was generally similar between treatment 
groups. These AEs included bradycardia (2.9% in both treatment groups), atrial fibrillation (4.2% with 
ticagrelor vs. 4.6% with clopidogrel), ventricular tachycardia (2.0% vs. 2.1%), or ventricular fibrillation 
(0.8% vs. 1.0%). The number of patients with investigator-reported on-treatment bradycardic events 
was numerically higher in patients taking ticagrelor compared to those taking clopidogrel (122 (1.3%) 
vs. 97 (1.1%)). There was a numerically higher frequency of AEs possibly related to brady-arrhytmias 
(13.4% vs. 13.1%) for ticagrelor. However, there was not a higher frequency of SAEs related to brady-
arrhytmias with ticagrelor. 
The Continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring in a subset of DISPERSE2 patients in Phase II that disclosed 
an imbalance among treatment groups in the incidence of largely asymptomatic ventricular pauses led 
to  an  extensive  Holter  monitoring  substudy  in  PLATO  for  in  depth  safety  assessment  of  this 
observation.  During  both  monitoring  periods  (visit  1  and  2),  numerically  more  patients  had  Holter-
detected bradycardia (41.5% vs 39.1% (visit 1)) and dropped beats (33.3% vs. 30.3% (visit 1) in the 
ticagrelor group compared to clopidogrel; heart rates were similar between groups. 
Renal related events were higher in ticagrelor vs clopidogrel (AEs (4.9% vs 3.8% and SAEs (0.8% vs. 
0.7%)).  The  analysis  of  the  time  to  first  event  was  significantly  different  between  treatment  groups 
(HR 1.31 [95% CI 1.14, 1.50]). The imbalance appears to be accounted for by event terms relating to 
creatinine increases and renal function as well as haematuria. According to the Applicant, confounding 
factors mainly could have accounted for this.  
Although  hepatic  events  were  similar,  110  patients  (ticagrelor  62  vs.  clopidogrel  48)  were  evaluated 
for potential liver injury as they had elevated liver enzymes. However, these cases often represented a 
moderate hyperbilirubinaemia with a mild contribution of conjugated bilirubin (<20%) without signs of 
cholestasis or hepatocellular liver injury.  
Regardless of the degree of renal impairment at baseline, the percentage of patients reporting AEs was 
numerically higher for ticagrelor-treated patients compared to clopidogrel-treated patients (80.6% vs. 
78.1% in moderate/severe and 75.1% vs. 73.0% in mild to normal). There was no imbalance for SAEs 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 37/50 
 
  
 
 
(34.3%  vs.  37.4%  in  moderate/severe  and  20.0%  vs.  19.6%  in  mild  to  normal).  In  patients  with 
hepatic impairment AEs were similar. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
On treatment, the ticagrelor group had a higher discontinuation rate due to AEs than clopidogrel (7.4% 
vs.  5.4%).  The  difference  was  driven  mainly  by  respiratory  disorders  (0.9%  vs.  0.2%),  where 
dyspnoea was the main reason (0.8% vs. 0.1%), as well as upper respiratory tract disorders (0.4% vs. 
0.1%), where epistaxis accounted for this difference. 
2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment is primarily based on data from the PLATO trial. More adverse events occurred 
with ticagrelor, mostly due to adverse events of moderate severity. This also resulted in more patients 
discontinuing due to an AEs with ticagrelor. Specific adverse events already identified during phase II 
trials were also apparent during the PLATO trial. Regarding the higher incidence of dyspnoea observed, 
the  Applicant  could  not  identify  a  mechanism.  However,  it  is  considered  that  this  constitutes  an 
adenosine-mediated  mechanism  as  a  similar  higher  incidence  has  been  reported  for  cangrelor 
(Tomoda,  N  Engl  J  Med.  2009  Dec  10;361(24):2385;  author  reply  2387-8).  This  is  an  issue  that  the 
Applicant has committed to further evaluate in the Risk Management Plan. Specific attention was also 
given  to  arrhythmic  effects,  also  likely  to  be  adenosine-mediated,  by  means  of  a  Holter  substudy. 
Although  this  substudy  identified  some  changes  related  to  heart  rhythm  (bradycardia  and  dropped 
beats),  this  did  not  translate  into  significantly  more  arrhythmic  AEs  in  the  total  population.  Also  no 
clear higher incidence of bradycardia was observed for ticagrelor. However, patients with an increased 
risk for bradyarrhythmias without a pacemaker in place were excluded in the PLATO trial and this issue 
is  reflected  in  the  SmPC  section  4.4.  A  higher  incidence  in  uric  acid  was  identified  (probably  due  to 
adenosine  degrade),  which  needs  further  follow-up  during  the  post-marketing  phase  as  part  of 
pharmacovigilance  activities;  although  no  direct  relation  with  gout  was  apparent.  In  addition,  renal 
events  were  higher,  which  may  also  be  related  to  a  possible  renal  effect  of  adenosine  due  to 
deterioration  in  renal  function  by  arteriolar  constriction.  However,  the  exact  mechanism  still  remains 
uclear. 
As  with  other  anticoagulants  specific  attention  was  given  to  bleeding  risk;  the  primary  safety  issue. 
Compared  to  clopidgrel  there  seems  not  to  be  a  higher  risk  of  major  bleedings,  and  fatal/life 
threatening  bleedings  with  ticagrelor  (mostly  gastro-intestinal),  although  it  is  numerically  slightly 
increased.  When  combined  with  minor  bleedings,  the  risk  with  ticagrelor  treatment  is  increased. 
However,  the  clinical  implications  of  minor  bleedings  are  unclear  and  a  focus  on  major  bleedings  is 
therefore of more clinical importance. Major bleeding risk is also increased for invasive treatment (PCI 
or  CABG)  leaving  the  net  clinical  benefit  to  be  lower  than  for  non-invasive  treatment  with  ticagrelor 
(although the p-value for the interaction is not significant (0.07)). Although treatment management is 
different  for  STEMI  and  NSTEMI  diagnosed  patients  there  is  not  a  clear  difference  in  major  bleedings 
between  these  patients.  The  course  of  bleedings  in  patients  undergoing  CABG  while  already  having 
been treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel is of particular importance, as it is postulated that the offset 
of inhibition of platelet aggregation is shorter with ticagrelor and therefore the risk of bleeding should 
be reduced. However, clinical data are not in line with these pharmacological data: ticagrelor confers a 
higher bleeding risk when discontinued within 96 hours (not until 24 hours) prior to CABG while having 
a lower bleeding risk when discontinued for a longer period prior to CABG. Nevertheless bleeding risk, 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 38/50 
 
  
 
 
identified  through  effects  on  Hb  concentration  and  chest  tube  drainage,  showed  to  be  similar  for 
ticagrelor  and  clopidogrel  treated  patients.  This  implies  that  ticagrelor  should  also  be  discontinued  7 
days prior to CABG as should clopidogrel. This is appropriately reflected in the SPC. In addition, it was 
found that ticagrelor has  a higher intracranial bleeding risk, although non-intracranial bleeding risk is 
lower  in  total.  As  history  of  previous  intracranial  bleed  was  already  part  of  the  exclusion  criteria,  a 
contra-indication  for  history  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  is  warranted  in  the  SmPC.  In  addition,  a 
higher  incidence  of  AEs  in  renal  impaired  patients  was  also  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  TIMI  or  PLATO 
defined  bleedings  seems  not  to  differ  with  reference  to  adjudication  of  number  of  bleedings  and  this 
fact demonstrated robustness of the PLATO defined bleeding terms.  
2.6.2 Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The most important safety indicator for anticoagulants, risk of bleeding, is of similar level for ticagrelor 
as with clopidogrel for major and death/life-threatening bleedings, although specific bleedings or cases 
are  associated  with  a  higher  bleeding  risk  which  have  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Bleeding  risk  was 
similar for STEMI and NSTEMI, but higher for invasive vs non-invasive treatment (the p-value for the 
interaction  was  not  significant).  In  addition,  several  particular  adverse  events  of  interest  have  been 
identified  already  in  phase  II-III  trials  and  need  further  intensive  follow-up  as  part  of  the 
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  the  future  (dyspnoea,  arrhythmic  effect,  increased  uric  acid,  higher 
serum  creatinine)  as  the  mechanism  of  action  (likely  adenosine-related)  and  clinical  implication  still 
remain unclear.

2.8. Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
The  pivotal  trial,  PLATO,  compared  ticagrelor  to  clopidogrel  administration  both  on  top  of  treatment 
with low dose ASA in prevention of thrombotic events in patients with ACS including patients managed 
medically, and those who are managed with PCI or CABG. This is considered justified as the common 
treatment  approach  in  ACS  is  treatment  with  ASA  and  with  the  addition  of  clopidogrel.  In  the 
treatment  of  ACS  conditions,  there  is  a  significant  risk  for  recurrent  MI  or  occurrence  of  death  within 
30  days  after  a  patient  is  presented  with  ACS,  particularly  for  STEMI  ACS.  An  endpoint  including  CV 
death, MI and another objective endpoints is considered essential. In PLATO the combined endpoint of 
CV death, MI and stroke is considered appropriate, but overall death is also considered of substantial 
importance. The  beneficial  effect  of  ticagrelor  is  convincing  as both  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  primary 
endpoint is demonstrated  at 30  days of follow-up (HR 0.88; p=0.0446) and  maintained in the longer 
term  of  up  to  12  months  for  the  primary  endpoint  (HR  0.84;  (0.77-0.92),  p=0.0003)  as  well  as  for 
overall  death.  An  extensive  group  of  patients  has  undergone  invasive  management,  in  particular  PCI 
(approximately  60%).  For  both  the  overall  intervention  subgroup  as  well  as  for  patients  undergoing 
PCI  the  beneficial  effect  of  ticagrelor  is  consistent  with  the  overall  beneficial  effect.  Of  particular 
importance is that this was irrespective of timing of PCI (less than 24 hr versus at-any-time). Post hoc 
analyses  showed  that  consistent  benefit  is  observed,  with  a  slight  advantage  for  medically  managed 
patients. The observed lower benefit for the North American subgroup is further discussed under risks 
above.  Although  more  adverse  events  and  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  occurred  with 
ticagrelor, there were fewer numbers of severe adverse events and deaths and sensitivity analyses did 
not demonstrate any differences in treatment effect based on differences in discontinuation.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Although there is a beneficial effect demonstrated for MI and CV death, there seems to be a negative 
effect on stroke (HR 1.17 (0.91-1.52, P=0.2249). It is not known whether a beneficial effect could be 
demonstrated in patients with a history of previous intracranial bleed. However, as it was an exclusion 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 46/50 
 
 
  
 
 
criterion in the PLATO trial, history of intracranial haemorrhage has been contra-indicated in the SmPC. 
Further,  beneficial  effect  of  ticagrelor  for  more  than  12  months  is  uncertain  even  though  25%  of 
patients  have  been  treated  for  more  than  12  months.  However,  a  large  trial  is  already  planned  to 
evaluate  long  term  treatment  effects  of  ticagrelor  in  patients  treated  longer  than  12  months  and  the 
Applicant  will  provide  these  data  for  CHMP  review  as  a  post-marketing  commitment.  In  addition, 
uncertainties  for  certain  subgroups  remain,  particularly  due  to  exclusion  criteria  in  the  PLATO  trial. 
Hepatic impaired patients are not evaluated. Another issue is that a beneficial effect of ticagrelor could 
have  been  observed  due  to  a  lack  of  efficacy  in  poor  metabolisers  of  clopidogrel  due  to  genetic 
polymorphism or concomitant PPI use. PPI treatment did not have an impact on the overall efficacy of 
ticagrelor as compared to clopidogrel. Upon closer inspection, event rates were larger in patients in the 
clopidogrel  treatment  arm  that  concomitantly  received  PPI  treatment  versus  those  who  did  not  take 
PPI.  Also  in  ticagrelor  patients,  more  endpoints  was  noted  in  survival  curves  for  patients  using  PPI 
versus  not  using  PPIs.  However,  this  is  probably  due  to  confounding  by  indication,  as  these  patients 
were  slightly  older  (0.4  years),  were  more  often  intended  for  invasive  management  (80%  vs  68%), 
had  more  often  an  index  diagnosis  of  STEMI  or  NSTEMI  vs  UA/other,  and  were  more  often  on 
concomitant  statin  treatment.  In  addition,  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  ticagrelor  (pH 
independent absorption, no CYP2C19 activation) suggest that PPI interaction is unlikely.  
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Bleeding  is  the  major  risk  associated  with  anticoagulants.  Although  the  overall  bleeding  risk  is  only 
numerically  higher  and  not  statistically  significantly  increased  as  compared  to  clopidogrel,  the  non-
procedural bleeding risk is significantly higher with ticagrelor (2.5% vs. 2.0%). In addition, PCI related 
bleeding risk is also increased (1.0% vs. 0.7%). This could indicate that the intrinsic bleeding risk with 
ticagrelor  is  higher  than  with  clopidogrel,  which  can  be  expected  with  a  higher  level  of  platelet 
aggregation  inhibition.  And  that  ticagrelor  treatment  can  be  time  critical  in  invasive  management  in 
terms  of  bleeding  risks.  For  instance,  this  would  be  in  congruence  with  the  observed  higher  bleeding 
risk  in  patients  discontinuing  ticagrelor  treatment  within  96  hours  before  CABG  treatment.  However, 
these  clinical  findings  are  inconsistent  with  the  pharmacological  evaluated  lower  %IPA  (Inhibition  of 
Platelet  Aggregation)  already  observed  after  24  hours  with  ticagrelor  compared  to  clopidogrel. 
Identification of bleeding risk based on Hb concentration and chest tube drainage showed that bleeding 
risk was similar for patients treated with ticagrelor and clopidogrel. This means that ticagrelor should 
also be discontinued 7 days prior to CABG. When major bleedings and minor bleedings are combined 
the  bleeding  risk  is  also  increased.  The  clinical  efficacy  in  the  North  American  region  (10%  of  the 
patients) is found to be lower with ticagrelor (HR 1.27 [95% CI 0.92, 1.75]), according to the Applicant 
due to use of higher doses of ASA in many cases. This was also observed for higher doses of ASA in 
other  regions.  Also  for  the  total  patient  group,  the  stroke  endpoint  demonstrated  an  unfavourable 
effect (HR 1.17 (0.91-1.52, P=0.2249). However, this endpoint is underpowered as not many of these 
endpoints have occurred. In addition, specific adverse events have been identified, such as dyspnoea, 
cardiac  arrhytmias,  increased  uric  acid  and  renal  events,  which  are  likely  to  be  associated  with  the 
ADP-mediated  mechanism.  Also  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  renal  impaired  patient  was 
found.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  pivotal  trial  was  not  a  placebo  controlled  trial,  so  adverse  events  could  only  be  compared  to 
clopidogrel.  This  is  however  justified  as  a  placebo  controlled  trial  would  be  unethical.  The  Applicant 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 47/50 
 
 
  
 
 
could  not  identify  the  mechanism  of  dyspnoea  with  ticagrelor.  This  will  be  further  evaluated  post-
marketing  and  it  is  reflected  in  the  RMP.  Likely  this  is  ADP  mediated  as  has  been  postulated  for 
cangrelor. Concerning the risk for cardiac arrhythmias (also likely to be ADP mediated), no clear effect 
was  noticed  in  the  pivotal  trial.  However,  AEs  possibly  related  to  brady-arrhythmias  (13.4%  vs. 
13.1%)  were  slightly  increased  with  ticagrelor.  Based  on  the  Holter  study  bradycardia  and  dropped 
beats were also slightly increased. A clear conclusion on this can therefore not be made and the issue 
will be further investigated in additional pharmacovigilance activities as specified in the RMP. However, 
exact mechanisms for believed ADP mediated adverse events still remain unclear.  
Although  hepatic  events  were  similar,  110  patients  (ticagrelor  62  vs.  clopidogrel  48)  were  evaluated 
for potential liver injury as they had elevated liver enzymes. However, these cases often represented a 
moderate hyperbilirubinaemia with a mild contribution of conjugated bilirubin (<20%) without signs of 
cholestasis or hepatocellular liver injury. Absolute values and change from baseline in liver serum ALT, 
AST,  ALP,  and  total  bilirubin  were  generally  similar  over  time  for  the  ticagrelor  and  clopidogrel 
treatment  groups,  and  there  was  a  similar  frequency  of  liver  function  test  abnormalities  in  the  2 
treatment  groups.  However,  an  imbalance  in  the  number  of  patients  with  bilirubin  increase  >2xULN 
(ticagrelor  25  vs  clopidogrel  10)  was  still  noticed.  Of  the  patients  with  available  samples  for 
genotyping,  most  were  homozygous  for  UGT1A1  polymorphisms  known  to  be  associated  to  Gilbert’s 
Syndrome. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Brilique,  co-administered  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  is  indicated  in  preventing  of  thrombotic  events  in 
patients with ACS (UA, STEMI and NSTEMI). Patients with STEMI and in particular NSTEMI have a poor 
short  term  prognosis  if  not  treated  optimally  and  are  therefore  treated  aggressively.  A  reduction  in 
recurrent  MI,  and  CV  death  or  overall death  is  of  particular importance  when  evaluating  drugs  in  the 
treatment  of  ACS.  A  reduction  in  these  endpoints  could  outweigh  some  of  the  severe  adverse  events 
typically  associated  with  the  investigated  drug.  Bleeding  is  the  most  important  risk  to  be  evaluated 
with these kind of products. Particularly the major bleedings risk is of importance, as this can lead to a 
considerable risk of morbidity, or even death. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
In  the  case  of  ticagrelor  a  clear  reduction  in  MI  and  CV  death  as  well  as  overall  death  has  been 
demonstrated when compared to clopidogrel. This clear beneficial effect outweighs the slightly higher 
risk for major bleedings, considered to be an acceptable risk in this high risk patient group. However, 
particular  precaution  should  be  given  in  certain  situations  where  bleeding  risk  can  be  considerably 
increased, as there are signs that treatment with ticagrelor is more time critical in relation to invasive 
management  (for  instance  CABG)  than  clopidogrel.  This  could  be  different  for  STEMI  and  NSTEMI 
patients  due  to  different  severity  and  different  management  of  these  patients.  However,  further 
comparison between these two groups of patients demonstrated a similar bleeding risk.  
2.8.1 Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  large  PLATO  trial  has  demonstrated  that  ticagrelor  is  more  beneficial  in  reducing  the  number  of 
primary endpoints of CV death, MI and stroke, although this is totally contributed by the CV death and 
MI  endpoints.  The  effect  on  stroke  is  not  found  to  be  beneficial,  although  not  statistically  significant, 
EMA/7143/2011  
Page 48/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
but warrants some concerns. Treatment of patients with a previous history of intracranial haemorrhage 
has been contra-indicated in the SmPC as these were contra-indicated in the PLATO trial and has been 
contra-indicated in the SmPC of prasugrel. A beneficial effect has been noticed for patients undergoing 
PCI  irrespective  of  the  timing  of  the  PCI.  Post  hoc  analyses  showed  that  consistent  benefit  was  also 
observed  according  to  invasive  or  non-invasive  treatment,  with  a  slight  advantage  for  medically 
managed (non-invasive) patients. Treatment with ticagrelor and timing of invasive management could 
be  of  particular  importance  in  relation  to  bleeding  risk,  because  major  bleedings  were  noticed  more 
frequently in patients undergoing PCI (probably due to early invasive management (within 24 hours)) 
and  for  CABG  procedures  too  close  to  discontinuation  of  ticagrelor.  Despite  a  difference  of  invasive 
management between STEMI and NSTEMI patients no great differences in bleeding risk was identified. 
The  claimed  faster  offset  of  platelet  aggregation  of  ticagrelor  in  comparison  to  clopidogrel  by  %IPA 
offset  (higher  within  24  hours)  after  discontinuation  of  the  drug  seems  only  to  be  theoretical.  Other 
markers of bleeding risk such as Hb concentration and chest tube drainage showed that bleeding risks 
were similar between ticagrelor and clopidogrel. This means that ticagrelor should also be discontinued 
7  days  prior  to  CABG.  Apart  from  the  bleeding  risk  some  typical  adverse  events  were  noticed  with 
ticagrelor already during the phase II trial. Although the higher incidence of dyspnoea is not considered 
as severe that this would lead to a negative benefit/risk (although slightly more discontinuations were 
noticed),  it is  of importance  to  identify  the  mechanism  of  this issue.  With  a  similar  product  cangrelor 
this adverse event was also noticed and it was postulated this was likely to be related to an ADP effect. 
A  possible  higher  incidence  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  (also  likely  ADP  mediated),  in  particular  the 
bradycardia,  were  identified  during  phase  II  trials  and  could  lead  to  severe  consequences.  Although 
bradycardia  was  also  noticed  with  a  slightly  higher  incidence  in  the  Holter  substudy,  no  higher 
incidence of severe adverse events could be noticed in the PLATO trial. Nevertheless, cardiac adverse 
event warrant further attention in the future, and it is reflected in the RMP, as no clear conclusions on 
this  could  be  made.  Also  other  probably  ADP-mediated  AEs  were  identified,  such  as  rise  in  uric  acid 
and renal events related to rise in serum creatinine, and other potential risks, like DILI (Drug Induced 
Liver Injury) or uric acid nephropathy, and should be followed within the RMP. A remarkable finding is 
the lower efficacy of ticagrelor in the North American population, although this is of less importance for 
the  marketing  authorisation  in  the  EU  as  enough  patients  remain  for  evaluation  of  the  target  EU 
population  (only  1300  patients  in  US).  A  higher  ASA  dose  was  the  main  identifiable  reason  of  the 
negative  effect  also  for  non-US  patients.  In  addition,  there  seems  to  be  a  lack  of  efficacy  in  the 
unstable  angina  subgroup.  However,  these  patients  are  not  identifiable  before  treatment.  The 
combined  UA/STEMI  patient  group  showed  similar  benefit/risk  to  the  STEMI  patients  group.  A 
limitation of the pivotal trial is that the long-term evaluation is largely limited to 12 months, but a trial 
is  planned  for  evaluation  longer  than  12  months.  The  SmPC  reflects  that  patients  undergoing  CABG 
should  stop  their  ticagrelor  treatment  with  at  least  an  interval  of  7  days  between  discontinuation  of 
ticagrelor  and  start  of  CABG,  similar  to  the  discontinuation  warning  in  the  SmPC  of  clopidogrel  and 
prasugrel.  Further,  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment,  and  history  of  intracranial 
haemorrhage are not included in the study and are contra-indicated in the ticagrelor SmPC. The higher 
incidence  of  adverse  events  in  renal  impaired  patients  and  additional  information  on  bleeding  risk  in 
certain patients or situations have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Risk management plan 
A  risk  management  plan  (version  4,  21  Sep  2010)  was  submitted.  The  CHMP,  having  considered  the 
data submitted, was of the opinion that:  
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns 
and 
no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information.  
2.9. Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Brilique  co-administered  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA)  in  the 
prevention  of  thrombotic  events  (cardiovascular  death,  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke)  in  patients 
with Acute Coronary Syndromes (unstable angina, non ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [NSTEMI] or 
ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]) including patients managed medically, and those who are 
managed  with  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)  or  coronary  artery  by-pass  grafting  (CABG) 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

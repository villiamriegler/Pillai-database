1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Albireo submitted on 6 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Bylvay, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (1) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the 
EMA/CHMP on 13 October 2016. 
Bylvay, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/1028 on 2012-07-17 in the following 
condition: Treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. 
Bylvay was granted eligibility to PRIME on 13 October 2016 in the following indication:  Treatment of 
Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) has a dramatic disease course with only 1 in 2 
patients surviving their 10 year and a maximum life expectancy of around 20 years without 
surgical relief or liver transplant. 
The currently available treatment options are insufficient. The unmet medical need can be agreed. 
The applicant has produced some non-clinical data supporting the mode of action and providing 
some indication of activity of the product for the use in humans. Clinical data, so far, suggests an 
acceptable safety profile. The clinical data, however, cannot be considered overwhelmingly 
convincing to support the notion of a highly efficacious product for the treatment of PFIC. Despite 
the ability of the product to reduce serum bile acid levels, there appears to be no information at 
the time of PRIME designation on positive influence on growth, decrease of the need for surgery or 
time to surgery, time to cirrhosis and other clinically relevant outcome parameters. 
• 
In principle, with no long-term clinical data available yet, results from non-clinical investigations 
could be taken into account to allow inclusion into the PRIME scheme by early entry. To better 
support this there should be a reasonable expectation that this early data will be complemented 
by clinical proof of concept results. In this specific case, the non-clinical data presented comes 
from 2 models of which one could be considered to more closely resemble the clinical setting. 
Some evidence is being presented that would indicate benefit with regard to liver histology, liver 
biochemistry and serum bile acid levels. The product’s activity is supported by this non-clinical 
data. In addition, the applicant does already present early clinical data supportive of the mode of 
action of the product. Taken together, this non-clinical and early clinical data could support 
inclusion of the product into the PRIME at the proof of principle stage. 
Furthermore, progress to proof of concept and confirmation of eligibility to the PRIME scheme were 
agreed on 13 October 2017 in view of the following: 
• 
The high unmet medical need for effective treatments for Progressive Familial Intrahepatic 
Cholestasis has been adequately supported and is agreed.  
•  A4250 is a selective inhibitor of ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (IBAT). It acts locally 
in the gut blocking reabsorption of bile acids and consecutively reducing systemic bile acid levels. 
The product could represent a valuable option for the treatment of PFIC.  
•  Data from the completed open-label paediatric study 003 support short-term activity in terms of 
reduction of serum bile acid levels and pruritus control; data from the study and the presented 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 8/182 
 
 
 
systematic literature review of PFIC patients treated with biliary diversion surgery suggest a 
correlation between serum bile acid levels and short and long-term outcomes and can be regarded 
as valid proof of concept.  
•  Clinical data to date suggest an acceptable safety profile; data from higher dose groups showed 
few cases of increased liver enzymes and/or bilirubin; this potential safety signal will have to be 
investigated thoroughly and will have to be put into perspective with a view to the differing 
pathophysiology between PFIC subtypes/mutations.  
The applicant applied for the following indication:  Bylvay is indicated for the treatment of progressive 
familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Bylvay as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s 
website: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Bylvay 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0377/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product in a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s requests for consideration 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances and Accelerated 
assessment 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 9/182 
 
 
 
 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
The CHMP agreed on 12 November 2020 to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as 
the product was considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on promising results 
shown by the submitted clinical data. The efficacy results for PFIC1 and PFIC2 patients seem to be in 
line with results obtained after surgical intervention (NAPPED study), showing resolution of pruritis and 
reduction of the circulating bile acid pool. Although only a limited number of patients are included in 
the clinical studies – which is not uncommon in orphan diseases – the data seem sufficient to make a 
benefit/risk assessment. The ultimate goal in treating PFIC patients with odevixibat is a long-term 
transplant-free or surgical biliary diversion free period.  
New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance odevixibat contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Johann Lodewijk Hillege was appointed by the CHMP as 
rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 23 April 2018. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
Use of ObsRO/PRO in study A4250-005 and the related analysis plan including long-term liver 
assessment, handling of missing data using mixed model repeated measurement (MMRM), follow-up of 
patients after exiting the extension study and maintenance of ODD. 
Protocol assistance 
The applicant received the following Protocol assistance on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication claimed for Odevixibat is for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic 
cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PFIC is a rare disease estimated to affect between one in every 50,000 to 100,000 children born 
worldwide [Davit-Spraul 2009]. Based on a recent literature review of PFIC conducted by Baker and 
colleagues [Baker 2019], including publications that described European and worldwide populations, 
the prevalence of PFIC in Europe was estimated at 0.07/10,000 persons. Given a population of 520 
million [Eurostat 2020], this would correspond to a total number of patients with PFIC of somewhere 
between 4000 and 5000 patients in the European Economic Association. 
Both sexes seem to be equally affected. PFIC represents 10% to 15% of cases of cholestasis in 
children and 10% to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Entero-hepatic circulation 
Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, excreted with bile into the duodenum, almost 
completely taken up again in the distal ileum and finally returned to the liver with portal blood in a 
process termed enterohepatic circulation.  
Bile acid synthesis, excretion, and reuptake are tightly regulated. The apical sodium-dependent bile 
acid transporter [ASBT; also known as ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) and SLC10A2] is pivotal for the 
almost complete reabsorption of conjugated bile acids (e.g. 95%) in the ileum. Pharmacological IBAT 
inhibition results in an increased bile acid load in the colon and subsequently, a lower bile acid pool 
associated with improved liver histology in animal models of cholestatic liver disease and non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH).  
The disease 
PFIC is generally categorised into 3 main subtypes, PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC3, although at least 3 other 
subtypes have been described in the literature (PFIC4-6) [Gunaydin 2018; Jacquemin 2000; Mehl 
2016; Srivastava 2014]. PFIC1 and PFIC2 together represent approximately two-thirds of cases of 
PFIC, and PFIC3, approximately one-third [Davit-Spraul 2009]. 
PFIC1 is due to mutations in the ATP8B1 gene, resulting in a deficiency of the FIC1 protein. The FIC1 
protein is located on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and facilitates the movement of 
phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.  
PFIC2, also referred to as bile salt export pump (BSEP) deficiency, is due to mutations in the ABCB11 
gene, resulting in a deficiency of the BSEP. BSEP is a transporter protein expressed at the canalicular 
membrane of hepatocytes and is the primary exporter of bile acids. PFIC2 can be further subdivided 
based on the BSEP genetic variant. Three BSEP variants are reported ((BSEP1, BSEP2, and BSEP3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 13/182 
 
 
 
BSEP3 (or truncated BSEP) are mutations that are predicted to have a non-functional protein are have 
the most severe disease form of PFIC2 (e.g. lowest native liver survival, hepatocellular carcinoma) 
[Wessel et al. 2020]. 
PFIC3 is caused by mutations in the ABCB4 gene resulting in a deficiency of the multidrug resistance 
protein 3 (MDR3). MDR3 is a phospholipid translocase involved in phospholipid secretion. 
Mutations in genes TJP2, NR1H4, or MYO5B have also been proposed as causes of PFIC [Henkel 2019]. 
In addition, some patients with PFIC do not have a mutation in any of these genes. In these cases, the 
cause of the condition is unknown [Goldberg 2020].

(adapted from Mehl et al., 2016). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
PFIC considers a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive genetic diseases, all of which result in 
intra-hepatic cholestasis with impaired bile acid secretion and transport [Alissa 2008; Bull 2018b] 
resulting in an accumulation of the components of bile within the liver, including bilirubin and bile 
acids. As hepatic levels of these components increase, they are excreted into the systemic circulation 
leading to jaundice and severe pruritus [Gunaydin 2018]. Due to the hepatic damage, the condition 
ultimately leads to portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [Hori 
2010].  
Severe pruritus is common in children diagnosed with PFIC. Significant pruritus can lead to severe 
cutaneous mutilation (often drawing blood), loss of sleep, irritability, poor attention, and impaired 
school performance [Mehl 2016].

The age of presentation varies by PFIC subtype, but typically the disease occurs in infancy and early 
childhood. Symptoms develop early with a median age at onset of approximately 3 months; 78% of 
patients develop jaundice before 12 months of age [Pawlikowska 2010].  
The diagnosis of PFIC is confirmed and the subtype identified by genetic analysis [Bull 2018b]. Portal 
hypertension and decompensation may be evident in the first year of life in PFIC2 and in early 
childhood in PFIC1 [Davit-Spraul 2009; Srivastava 2014]. Other features include fat malabsorption 
resulting in weight and height below normal centiles, and fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E, and K) 
deficiency.  
Review of the literature indicates that histological findings in liver tissue obtained by biopsy in patients 
with PFIC vary depending upon the subtype, but for all subtypes, the findings progress from 
cholestasis to fibrosis to cirrhosis as was initially described by Alonso and colleagues [Alonso 1994]. 
The rate of progression varies by subtype and reflects the general rate of progression of clinical 
symptomatology. Patients with PFIC Type 2 cirrhosis have been identified as early as 6 months of age 
and most patients rapidly progress cirrhosis [Morotti 2011]. Patients with PFIC Type 1 typically 
demonstrate a slower progression; however, micronodular cirrhosis has been described in the second 
and third year of life. Progression to cirrhosis is typically even slower in patients with PFIC Type 3, 
where cirrhosis is usually first identified in the second decade of life [Morotti 2011].  
The prognosis is poor; many PFIC patients progress to end-stage liver disease and require liver 
transplantation [Mehl 2016]. 
The main features of the major PFIC subtypes are summarized in Table 1 and an overview of common 
complications and manifestations of PFIC are summarised in Table 1.

2.1.5.  Management 
There is currently no pharmaceutical treatment approved for use in PFIC1 and PFIC2. The therapeutic 
choices are restricted to supportive care such as nutritional support, prevention of vitamin deficiencies, 
and symptomatic treatment of extrahepatic features, including pruritus. Medical treatment options 
include off-label use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), rifampicin, hydroxyzine, antihistamines, and 
naltrexone, but none of these therapies have proven benefits for the long-term prognosis of patients 
with PFIC [European Association for the Study of the Liver 2009; Hori 2010]. A minority of patients 
respond nominally and transiently to these interventions [Hori 2010].  
In France, UDCA is approved for the treatment of PFIC3, but not for PFIC1 and PFIC2. UDCA has been 
shown to improve symptoms and hepatic biochemical parameters in up to 50% of patients with PFIC3, 
yet limited effects of off-label use have been reported in patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2 [Baker 2019; 
European Association for the Study of the Liver 2009]. The ability of UDCA to mitigate liver damage 
has not been evaluated in controlled trials in patients with PFIC1, PFIC2, or PFIC3.  
Rifampicin, an antibiotic, inhibits bile acid uptake into hepatocytes. The mechanism of its effect on 
pruritus is unknown [Galeazzi 1980; Ghent 1988] but may include alterations of intestinal flora leading 
to changes in the secondary bile acid pool [Kriegermeier 2020]. 
As symptomatic medical treatment is rarely effective, surgical options are considered, including biliary 
diversion (such as partial external biliary diversion [PEBD] or ileal exclusion) and liver transplantation. 
Treatment-resistant pruritus is the leading indication for surgical biliary diversion, particularly in 
patients with PFIC2 where it is listed as an indication for surgery in 89% of patients [van Wessel 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 16/182 
 
 
 
 
2019b]. Surgical biliary diversion often results in rapid and dramatic reductions in serum bile acids and 
pruritus, as well as improvements in sleep disturbance and, in the long term, it is associated with less 
fibrosis and a catch-up in linear growth over 1 to 2 years [Arnell 2010; Melter 2000; Schukfeh 2012; 
Yang 2009]. The beneficial impact of surgical biliary diversion on long-term native liver survival has 
recently been shown to correlate with reducing serum bile acids observed following the surgery [van 
Wessel 2019a; van Wessel 2020]. For many patients, biliary diversion is not a permanent solution due 
to refractory pruritus or end-stage liver disease [Baker 2019; Bull 2018a]. Continued elevated serum 
bile acids and pruritus are also seen in some patients after biliary diversion surgery.  
While biliary diversion surgery may postpone or eliminate the need for liver transplantation and 
improve pruritus associated with PFIC in some patients, it is an invasive procedure with unwanted 
consequences. Patients experience complications related to the external stoma requiring surgical 
revision and biliary diversion, leading to postoperative cholangitis [Gunaydin 2018]. High rates of 
clinically significant dehydration and hyponatremia have also been reported after biliary diversion 
surgery [Mehl 2016]. 
Liver transplantation will, however, rarely be avoided despite biliary diversion. Liver transplantation is 
considered when patients have end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, have failed off-label 
medical treatment and/or biliary diversion surgery and refractory pruritus results in poor QoL. 
Reported rates of liver transplantation range between 40 to 100% in patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2 
[Baker 2019]. A recent large case series reported that 30% of a cohort of patients with PFIC2 
underwent liver transplant a median of 2.4 years after surgical biliary diversion and by 18 years of age 
only 32% of patients with PFIC2 were alive with native liver [van Wessel 2020]. This underscores how 
common liver transplantation is in this disease.  
Although liver transplantation may resolve cholestasis in patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2, the overall 
outcome remains unsatisfactory in many patients with PFIC1; this is mainly due to extrahepatic 
manifestations, organ rejection, and the complications and the risks associated with chronic immune-
suppressant therapy [Baker 2019; Bull 2018a]. Specific to PFIC1, an undesired effect of liver 
transplant is worsening of the extrahepatic manifestations, such as diarrhoea and short stature. The 
increase in bile acid secretion in the stool post-transplant causes high-volume osmotic diarrhoea that 
has a significant impact on QoL [Mehl 2016]. High-volume osmotic diarrhoea is often associated with 
severe liver steatosis and/or steatohepatitis that may lead to cirrhosis and re-transplantation [Davit-
Spraul 2009].  
Survival in patients with PFIC not undergoing surgical biliary diversion or liver transplant is 50% at 10 
years of age and <10% at 20 years of age, highlighting the rapid rate of progression of this life-
threatening disease [Pawlikowska 2010]. 
In summary, PFIC is a life-threatening disease associated with significant morbidity. There is a high 
unmet need for these patients whose treatment options are limited and restricted to surgical 
intervention and off-label symptomatic medical therapies. A treatment option that reduces pruritus 
would not only provide much needed symptomatic relief, but if that reduction in pruritus reduces the 
need for biliary diversion surgery or liver transplantation, would also be disease-modifying. 
About the product 
Odevixibat (A4250) is a small molecule that acts as a potent, selective inhibitor of the IBAT, 
alternatively known as the ASBT. Odevixibat is being developed for the treatment of cholestatic liver 
diseases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 17/182 
 
 
 
IBAT is a luminal epithelium glycoprotein expressed mainly in the distal ileum that co-transports 
sodium and bile acids, efficiently moving bile acids from the lumen of the small intestine across the 
apical brush border membrane. As part of enterohepatic circulation, bile acids are then shuttled to the 
basolateral membrane, ultimately returning to the liver via portal venous blood. While minimal passive 
reabsorption of bile acids occurs throughout the intestine, active transport via IBAT is the major 
mechanism for bile acid reabsorption. Over 95% of the circulating bile acid pool is returned to the liver 
on a daily basis [Hofmann 2009; Miethke 2016]. Therefore, IBAT is a key regulator of the bile acid pool 
and a key element in enterohepatic circulation [Dawson 2003].  
Odevixibat is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to IBAT to 
decrease the reuptake of bile acids into the liver, increasing the clearance of bile acids through the 
colon and lowering hepatic bile acid load and serum bile acids (Figure 2). Odevixibat has minimal 
systemic exposure at therapeutic dose ranges. By inhibiting the IBAT with high selectivity and potency, 
odevixibat has the potential to reduce the systemic accumulation of bile acids that result from 
cholestasis, relieve pruritus, improve liver function, and modify the progression of liver damage in 
patients with PFIC without surgical intervention.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on promising results shown by the 
submitted clinical data. The efficacy results for PFIC1 and PFIC2 patients seemed to be in line with 
results obtained after surgical intervention (NAPPED study), showing resolution of pruritis and 
reduction of the circulating bile acid pool. Although only a limited number of patients are included in 
the clinical studies – which is not uncommon in orphan diseases – the data were sufficient to allow for 
evaluation of the benefit/risk of odevixibat under an accelerated timetable.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation (MA) under 
exceptional circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above-mentioned Regulation based 
on applicant’s claim that the applicant is not able to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and 
safety under normal conditions of use.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 18/182 
 
 
 
 
 
Referring to Part II.6 of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, the applicant submitted the following 
justification for this request:  
•  The indications for which the product is intended are encountered so rarely that the 
applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or 
PFIC is a rare disease estimated to affect one in every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide. 
The Applicant has conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in this rare indication. The 
study met both regional (EU and FDA) primary efficacy endpoints. Based on review of the pooled 
data across the two Phase 3 studies (A4250-005 and A4250-008) the improvements in serum bile 
acids levels and pruritus severity were maintained for up to 96 weeks. Evidence from literature was 
provided to show that the demonstrated treatment effect can be translated into improved long-
term (about 10 years) liver survival. The literature data discussing serum bile acids were provided 
since it appears impossible to provide clinical trial follow-up data over a time span of about 10 
years, especially in an extremely rare disease. It is acknowledged that, although improvements in 
hepatic parameters and liver histopathology parameters were observed, a delay of surgical biliary 
diversion (SBD) or orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) has not been fully demonstrated. As such, an 
indisputable favourable effect on the underlying disease has not been comprehensively 
demonstrated. Therefore, it can be appreciated that the data are not comprehensive in the sense 
that the clinical benefit for a full treatment effect has been demonstrated.  
Thus, it may be impossible to establish a comprehensive clinical database based on clinical trial 
data to determine the long-term effect on liver survival (delay of SBD/OLT). Given that PFIC is an 
orphan disease it is anticipated that robust confirmation of delay of relevant clinical outcome 
parameters like SBD/OLT is challenging, if not unfeasible. Taken together, it can be concluded that 
the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence for the long-term 
benefit despite literature data that support the observation that this long-term effect will be 
achieved. 
• 
In the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be 
provided 
It has not been firmly established whether serum bile acids are predictive as a surrogate 
parameter for liver survival. Based on review of the published literature, there were no conclusions 
regarding or negating the potential for serum bile acid levels to be or become a surrogate endpoint 
for predicting liver survival. Rather, the conclusions pointed at the observed treatment benefit 
following surgical intervention (SBD or liver transplantation) and intermediate and long-term 
benefits following alleviation of cholestasis, reduction or normalization of serum bile acid levels on 
clinical outcomes. Decades of published data from clinical cohort studies have consistently shown 
the clinical benefits of surgical biliary diversion and liver transplantation on cholestasis (reduction 
in serum bile acid and hepatic health), alleviation of cholestatic pruritus, catch up in growth and 
native liver survival/reversal of disease progression in PFIC patients. The applicant indicated that 
the relevance of bile acids as a key component of the hepatic pathology in PFIC has been 
demonstrated also by recent publications from the Natural course and Prognosis of PFIC and Effect 
of biliary Diversion (NAPPED) consortium (van Wessel 2019a; van Wessel 2020).  
In addition, the applicant highlighted that NAPPED data show that approximately 50% of the liver 
transplants in patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2 are performed for the relief of intractable pruritus 
prior to the development of end-stage liver disease. 
Therefore, in the absence of long-term clinical trial data in the very rare disease, the applicant 
considers that the results of the A4250-005 and A4250-008 studies have not unequivocally 
qualified serum bile acids as a surrogate parameter for long-term liver survival.

• 
It would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such 
information  
This is not considered applicable for this application. 
The Directive contemplates that the specific obligations be directed toward studies that will further 
elucidate the benefit-risk profile (“the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies 
within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis 
of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile”).  
The applicant accepted the premise of the following post-authorisation measures: 
• 
In order to investigate whether odevixibat treatment delays surgical biliary diversion (SBD) 
and/or liver transplantation (OLT), with matched comparison against untreated PFIC 
patients, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a study based on data from a 
disease registry of patients aged 6 months or older with progressive familial intrahepatic 
cholestasis (PFIC) according to an agreed protocol. Annual interim reports are to be 
submitted along with the annual reassessments. 
Taken together, an application for a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances, 
given the view that the requirements laid down in Part II.6 of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC 
apply.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of odevixibat sesquihydrate is (2S)-2-{[(2R)-2-(2-{[3,3-dibutyl-7-
(methylsulfanyl)-1,1-dioxo-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1λ6,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-8-
yl]oxy}acetamido)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetly]amino}butanoic acid sesquihydrate corresponding to 
the molecular formula C37H48N4O8S2.●1.5 H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 768.0 g/mol and the 
following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 20/182 
 
 
 
Figure 3: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of odevixibat sesquihydrate was elucidated by a combination of elemental 
analysis, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry, single crystal x-ray diffraction and specific optical rotation. The solid-state properties of 
the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS), x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and variable humidity 
XRPD. Crystals were further analysed by scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, specific 
surface area measurements and particle size distribution. 
The active substance is a white to off-white hygroscopic crystalline solid with some amorphous 
content. It exhibits pH-dependent solubility, being insoluble from pH 1-4 with a maximum solubility at 
neutral pH. Polymorphic form and particle size are controlled in the active substance specification.  
Odevixibat exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 2 chiral centres. Chiral purity is controlled 
in 2 starting materials and is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC in the active substance.  
Polymorphism has been observed. Two forms were identified but only one was found to be stable and 
is routinely produced by the proposed commercial manufacturing process, along with some amorphous 
material. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Odevixibat sesquihydrate is synthesized convergently by a single manufacturer in 6 main steps 
followed by crystallisation using 3 well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The 
starting materials are defined in line with CHMP scientific advice. The final crystallisation conditions 
ensure formation of the sesquihydrate salt in the desired polymorphic form. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The specification for 
one raw material was not considered acceptable due to the lack of an assay test. It was not possible to 
revise the specification during the procedure due to the hygroscopic nature of the material and 
requires installation of specialized equipment to test. Given that the charge of this material is variable 
and determined by an in-process control (IPC), it is agreed that additional development can be done 
post-authorisation. The applicant should provide an updated specification, including a limit for assay, 
as soon as practically available, but within three months of authorisation.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. In the initial submission, the risk assessment for genotoxic 
impurities was lacking detail resulting in a major objection from CHMP. In response, the company 
provided a thorough risk assessment for potential and actual genotoxic impurities, using the hazard 
assessment tools from ICH M7, as well as providing experimental and calculated purge data. The 
response was deemed adequate and the control strategy for genotoxic impurities is acceptable. Other 
potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The bond forming reactions have been consistent, but reaction 
conditions, reagents, solvents, and isolation steps have changed over time. Changes introduced have 
been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The process was developed using elements of Quality by Design (QbD) including extensive use of risk 
assessments. For low risk parameters, acceptable ranges have been defined. For medium and high-risk 
parameters, multivariate design of experiments (DoE) studies were conducted to optimise reaction 
conditions and define critical process parameters (CPPs). No design spaces are claimed. The overall 
control strategy is considered acceptable. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double,  semi-transparent  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags 
secured  with  plastic  ties.  Silica  gel  desiccant  is  placed  between  the  inner  and  outer  LDPE  bags.  The 
double  LDPE  bags  are  placed  in  an  aluminium  can.  The  LDPE  bags  comply  with  the  EC  directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identity (FT-IR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), chiral impurities (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC-HS), particle size 
distribution (LALLS), polymorphic form (XRPD), water content (KF), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and most non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. However, the method for particle size 
distribution is not considered fully validated yet. The applicant should complete validation of the 
analytical method for particle size distribution post-authorisation including accuracy and robustness. 
The applicant should provide the requested additional data as soon as practically available, but within 
one month of authorisation. In addition, the applicant should provide data which demonstrates the 
stability indicating nature of the chiral HPLC method as soon as practically available, but within three 
months of authorisation. It is acceptable to provide this data post-approval since no critical impact on 
the quality of the active substance is expected. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from the 4 process performance qualification batches of the active substance are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Batch analysis 
data from development and stability batches made with earlier processes met with the specifications in 
place at the time.

Stability 
Stability data from 6 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer but 
using an earlier process stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long 
term conditions (25°C / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% 
RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Three of the batches contained a different amount of crystalline to 
amorphous material than in the intended commercial material. The following parameters were tested: 
description, assay, impurities, chiral impurities, water content, solid-state form, and microbiological 
attributes. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. An 
IPC for particle size distribution is included in the finished product process so this attribute was not 
measured during stability studies. 
One impurity was out of specification (OOS) in 4 batches at every time-point including at release. No 
increase was seen over time and it is not considered a degradant. The process was subsequently 
amended to reduce the amount of this impurity to below 0.1% in the active substance. Water content 
does increase in a non-linear fashion over time. Extrapolation data indicate that water content will not 
increase above the specification limit within the assigned re-test period. No trends were observed for 
any of the other measured parameters. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. No changes were 
observed to measured parameters including impurities, other than some discolouration. The active 
substance is stored protected from light as a precaution. 
Results under stressed conditions were also provided. The active substance is relatively stable in the 
solid state to thermal and photolytic conditions. Degradation occurs in aqueous solution under acidic, 
basic and oxidative conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months, with the 
storage condition “Store below 25°C in the proposed container in order to protect from light.”

The finished product was developed for immediate release using common pharmaceutical excipients 
and conventional manufacturing procedures. The formulation used in Phase 3 clinical studies and the 
intended commercial formulation was designed to be appropriate for the paediatric patient population 
and to allow for weight-based dosing using these fixed strengths. The formulation was designed to 
support the administration in paediatric patients with potential swallowing difficulties, providing the 
possibility to either swallow the capsules whole or to open the capsules and add the contents to 
suitable soft foods for administration. The formulation was designed for acceptable palatability 
considering capsule size, pellet diameter, and the number of pellets. 
Based on the clinical and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics, as well as commercial requirements, a 
QTPP was defined for the development of odevixibat oral capsules and sprinkle capsules. The QTPP 
included the route of administration, palatability, dosage strength, size, appearance, container closure 
system, pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic characteristics, excipients and stability. The critical 
quality attributes identified are description, identification, assay, uniformity of dosage units, 
dissolution, degradation products, water content and microbiological quality. 
During the formulation development, the size of capsules used to facilitate ease of dosing was 
considered, the size of the pellets was considered. The overall excipient content was reduced following 
phase 2 clinical studies in order to minimize the amount ingested by the target paediatric patients. 
Various coating agents were investigated and hypromellose was found to be compatible with the active 
substance. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with 
Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report.

The active substance is poorly soluble in aqueous media and is isolated as a partially amorphous 
crystalline solid. In order to coat the MCC pellets, the active substance is prepared as a coating 
suspension with hypromellose. Studies have shown that the crystalline fraction retains the same 
polymorphic form during manufacture and storage. A biorelevant dissolution study was undertaken to 
investigate the performance in vivo, considering the site of action in the terminal ileum. Odevixibat has 
very low solubility in Fed state simulated gastric fluid, irrespective of the degree of crystallinity. In 
Fasted state simulated intestinal fluid, only modest differences in odevixibat solubility for the low and 
high crystalline material were observed over a 5-hour period. Under conditions representative of the 
fed small intestine, the solubility threshold for the maximum daily dose of odevixibat (7.2 mg) is 29 
µg/mL and, under these conditions, all crystalline forms exceeded the solubility threshold by at least 
10-fold in the Fed state simulated intestinal fluid media. This is particularly important because patients 
are instructed to take the drug in the fed state. As a consequence, irrespective of the crystalline form 
of the active substance in the finished product, full dissolution of the active substance will readily occur 
in the fed state following immediate-release dosing given the 3-5-hour transit of material to the 
terminal ileum, the site of action.  
CHMP originally raised 2 major objections in relation to the dissolution method. In the first, the 
applicant was asked to redevelop the method as it was not considered sufficiently discriminatory and 
the use of a surfactant was not justified. In the second, the proposed dissolution specification was 
deemed to be too wide. In response, the applicant extensively described efforts to develop a 
discriminatory dissolution method for quality control (QC) purposes. The method had to take into 
account both the dissolution of capsules and the active substance. The applicant investigated different 
apparatus, media of different pH and ionic strength, the need for a surfactant and other parameters 
such as impeller speed and justified the proposed method. 
Discriminatory power was investigated in relation to active substance properties including crystalline 
content (30-70%) and active substance particle size (milled vs unmilled) as well as MCC pellet size and 
thickness of the hypromellose coating. In addition, the applicant tightened the dissolution specification 
to Q=80% in 15 mins (pellets) and 20 mins (capsules). Considering the site of action, the biorelevant 
solubility study data, the efforts made to develop a more discriminatory method, the inherent 
properties of the active substance and other elements of the control strategy which ensure the quality 
of the finished product, the current method is considered sufficiently discriminatory as a QC method. 
Given that all capsules strengths may be swallowed or sprinkled on food, the applicant is 
recommended to perform additional experimental work in order to develop a single dissolution 
specification for all capsule strengths. 
The dissolution profiles of batches used in clinical trials and the process validation batches were shown 
to be similar. Similarly, dissolution profiles of the different capsule strengths were shown to be 
equivalent. 
The development and optimisation of the manufacturing process used to produce the finished product 
are described by the following: 
•  Conduct of risk assessment examining material attributes and finished product process steps 
•  Discussion of each process step and associated development experiments 
•  Discussion of DoE studies to challenge the process robustness, determine parameter ranges, and 
assess the impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs) for commercial production. 
From these activities, a control strategy was developed for each process step. 
A risk assessment was performed to identify the potential impact of materials (active substance 
attributes and finished product excipients), and each process step on the CQAs of the finished product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 27/182 
 
 
 
Based on this risk assessment for each process step, the process parameters potentially affecting the 
identified CQAs were identified. Particle size was defined for the MCC pellets to ensure a consistency 
with the grade used throughout development and viscosity requirements are defined for the 
hypromellose coating agent to ensure consistent coating. Each process parameter was determined to 
be either a critical process parameter (CPP) or a non-critical process parameter (PP). The evaluation of 
the process parameters, together with the risk assessment, formed the basis for the control strategy 
for the finished product manufacturing process. 
The compatibility of the odevixibat pellets and the specified soft foods was evaluated by sprinkling 
approximately 40 mg of 5 mg/g or 15 mg/g odevixibat pellet sample equivalent to that contained in 
one 200 or 600 µg capsule, onto approximately 15 g (1 tablespoon) of soft food. Comparison of the 
recovery results of odevixibat from each FAV with that from the control pellet samples demonstrate 
that patients will receive the intended dose once the pellets sprinkled onto soft food are entirely 
ingested within 2 hours. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottles with tamper evident, child resistant polypropylene closures. The 
materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process along with the in-process controls consists of 3 main steps: preparation of 
the coating mixture, coating of the MCC pellets and encapsulation. The process is considered to be a 
non-standard manufacturing process due to the low active substance content. 
Given the non-standard manufacturing process, full validation would normally be required at the time of 
submission of the application. This data was not provided resulting in a major objection. In response, 
the applicant justified the approach on several grounds: 
• 
The product is indicated for an unmet medical need and early access to patients would be life-
saving; 
•  Despite the low active substance content, the dispersion and milling of the active substance in 
the  coating  suspension  ensures  homogeneous  distribution  as  evidenced  by  blend  and  content 
uniformity data. In addition, uniformity of dosage units is routinely tested at release; 
• 
The  validation  campaign  is  almost  complete  and  will  be  finalized  by  the  time  a  marketing 
authorisation  is  granted.  In  addition,  data  from  IPCs  during  the  completed  batches  was 
presented, providing further evidence of content uniformity; 
•  A  concurrent  validation  approach  is  proposed  as  allowed  by  GMP  and  explained  in  the  “draft 
toolbox guidance on scientific elements and regulatory tools to support quality data packages for 
PRIME  marketing  authorisation  applications”  (EMA/CHMP/BWP/QWP/IWG/694114/2019).  A 
validation protocol has been provided to support this approach. 
Given the PRIME status, the unmet medical need, the data provided so far and following consultation 
with the inspectorate with oversight over the manufacturing site, this approach is deemed acceptable. 
So far, all evidence indicates that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form  including  description  (visual),  identification  (UPLC,  UV),  assay  (UPLC),  degradation  products 
(UPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (HPLC),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbiological attributes (Ph. Eur.). 
Limits for specified impurities are set in line with ICH Q3B. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on a batch of each strength using a validated method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it can be concluded that no elemental impurity controls are required.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Both N,N-dimethylformamide and N-
methylpyrrolidone are used as solvents in the active substance process which could potentially lead to 
formation of NDMA and NMBA should a nitrosating agent be present. Although no nitrosating agents 
are deliberately added, the applicant nonetheless chose to test 7 batches of active substance for both 
NDMA and NMBA using a validated and sufficiently sensitive method (LoQ < 10% acceptable intake). 
No nitrosamines were detected. No risks were identified associated with the finished product. Based on 
the information provided no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches per strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Primary stability studies were conducted using a matrixed design, covering 8 production scale batches 
in total across the different strength (3 batches each of the 200 and 1200 μg capsules, 1 batch each of 
the 400 and 600 μg capsules). Samples were stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 
ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of 
medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and 
microbiological attributes. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The stability data show that the finished product is stable when packaged in the intended container 
closure system under all storage conditions. There is little or no variability with respect to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 29/182 
 
 
 
attributes of assay, total degradation products, dissolution, water content, and microbiological 
attributes. For individual degradation products, there were changes observed during the stability 
studies – some increased over time while others decreased. The results justify wider shelf-life limits for 
specified impurities. 
An in-use study was conducted to simulate patient handling. One batch of each dosage strength 
packaged in the commercial packaging configuration was evaluated. The stability results obtained after 
4 weeks at 25°C/60% RH show no significant changes that would adversely impact product quality for 
the attributes tested. All the results are within the proposed commercial specifications. No special 
directions or labelling requirements are considered necessary for the finished product. 
A photostability study was conducted to evaluate intrinsic stability characteristics of the finished 
product on exposure to ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. Open-dish samples showed a very slight 
increase in degradation products but remained compliant with the proposed commercial specification. 
A bulk holding time of 12 months for the capsules packaged in double polyethylene bags and placed in 
HDPE drums is justified given the provided stability data. 
Based on the provided stability data, the shelf life of 24 months without special storage conditions 
when stored in HDPE bottle with a tamper evident, child-resistant polypropylene closure as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The major objections relating to potential genotoxic impurities have been adequately resolved. The 
applicant provided adequate justification that the QC dissolution method is suitable for its intended 
purpose and tightened the specification limit but is recommended to derive a single limit for all 
capsules. The applicant also provided a justification for not submitting full process validation data and 
the proposed concurrent validation approach is acceptable. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points included as recommendations for future 
quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant should provide an updated specification for sodium thiomethoxide, including a 
limit for assay, as soon as practically available, but within three months of authorisation; 
The applicant should complete validation of the analytical method for particle size distribution. 
A sample concentration range should be proposed and data on the accuracy and robustness of 
the method is awaited. The applicant should provide the requested additional data as soon as 
practically available, but within one month of authorisation; 
The applicant should provide data which demonstrates the stability indicating nature of the 
chiral HPLC method as soon as practically available, but within three months of authorisation; 
•  Given that all capsules strengths may be swallowed or sprinkled on food, the applicant is 
recommended to perform additional experimental work in order to develop a single dissolution 
specification for all capsule strengths. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Odevixibat acts as a potent, selective inhibitor of the IBAT (also known as the ASBT). It is intended to 
prevent reabsorption of bile acids from the gastrointestinal tract (inhibit the enterohepatic circulation 
of bile acids). It is proposed to be indicated for the treatment of is PFIC. This is a group of familial 
cholestatic conditions caused by defects in biliary epithelial transporters. Four types can be 
distinguished: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Type 1, mutations in ATP8B1, a gene coding for a P-type ATPase protein, FIC-1, that is 
responsible for phospholipid translocation across membranes, also called Byler disease 
Type 2, mutations in ABCB11, the gene that codes for the bile salt export pump, or BSEP, also 
called ABCB11 deficiency or BSEP deficiency 
Type 3 mutations in ABCB4, the gene encoding multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3),[5] 
which codes for a floppase responsible for phosphatidylcholine translocation, also called ABCB4 
deficiency or MDR3 deficiency 
Type 4 (OMIM #615878), from mutation in TJP2.  
The clinical presentation usually occurs first in childhood with progressive cholestasis. This usually 
leads to failure to thrive, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation.

In vivo 
The ED50 of AZD8294 on 75SeHCAT (Taura-23-selena-25-Homocholic Acid) Intestinal Absorption in 
ApoE Knockout Mice In Vivo (Study 24546) 
This study was conducted to assess the effect of AZD8294 (odevixibat) on intestinal bile acid 
absorption using 75SeHCAT (Tauro-23-[75-Se] Selena-25-homocholic acid) as a tracer in ApoE knockout 
mice. Groups of the mice were orally administered vehicle or odevixibat with the doses 0.01, 0.039, 
0.156, or 0.625 μmol/kg (7.409, 28.90, 115.58, or 463.06 μg/kg), respectively. Approximately 30 
minutes later, 75SeHCAT (0.1 μCi per 0.1 mL per mouse) was orally given to each mouse. The 
radioactivity of 75SeHCAT remaining in the body of the mouse and in the faeces excreted by the mouse 
during a 24-hour period after 75SeHCAT administration were measured separately, and the inhibitory 
effect of odevixibat on intestinal 75SeHCAT absorption was estimated. 
The 75SeHCAT faecal excretion during the 24-hour period after 75SeHCAT administration was 37%, 
91%, 85%, 56%, and 42% of the administered dosage in the mice given vehicle or odevixibat at doses 
of 0.625 μmol/kg, 0.156 μmol/kg, 0.039 μmol/kg, and 0.01 μmol/kg (463.06, 115.58, 28.90, or 7.409 
μg/kg), respectively. Correspondingly, the inhibition of odevixibat by the doses mentioned above on 
intestinal 75SeHCAT absorption was 86%, 76%, 30%, and 8%, respectively. The ED50 of the inhibitory 
effect was estimated to be 0.073 μmol/kg (54.09 μg/kg).

The effect of 4 IBAT inhibitors on cholesterol lowering has been studied in ApoE/low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL)-receptor knockout mice at a concentration of 0.625 μmol/kg (463.08 μg/kg) or vehicle 
(polyethylene glycol [PEG]:ethanol:water 7:1:2) as a control via oral gavage. The most potent 
compound, odevixibat, reduced plasma cholesterol levels by 40% (p=0.001) and FPLC measurements 
showed that this reduction of cholesterol was due to reductions in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL; 
45% to 61% reduction) and LDL (7% to 24% reduction), whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol levels were unaffected (odevixibat, AR-H073582) or slightly but not significantly increased 
(AR-H064965, AR-H073559). Odevixibat, AR-H073582, and AR-H073559 did not decrease triglycerides 
significantly. Plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were not affected by drug treatment, and 
bile-acid secretion was increased in all treated groups (from 2.3 ± 0.8 up to a maximum of 4.1 ± 1.3 
μM). 
AZD8294: Duration of the Inhibitory Effect on the Intestinal Bile Salt Absorption in ApoE Knockout Mice 
In Vivo (Study 24872) 
Groups of mice were administered a single oral dose by gavage of vehicle (PEG:ethanol:water 
70:10:20) or odevixibat (0.625 μmol/kg or 463.08 μg/kg). Odevixibat was given to the mice 0.5, 3, 6, 
and 10 hours in advance of administration of the bile acid marker 75SeHCAT (0.25 μCi/mouse, PO) and 
faecal excretion of 75SeHCAT was measured over 24 hours. The faecal excretion of 75SeHCAT during a 
24-hour period was significantly increased in the mice given odevixibat in comparison with that in the 
mice given vehicle. The inhibition of 75SeHCAT absorption during a 24-hour period was 85%, 81%, 
40%, and 28% when odevixibat was administered 0.5, 3, 6, or 10 hours, respectively, in advance of 
75SeHCAT. 
IBAT/ASBT Inhibition with A4250 in the Mdr2 Knockout Model (Study ARR4250000117) 
A pilot experiment was conducted in wild-type male mice of FVB/N background fed either control diet 
or food with the IBAT/ASBT inhibitor A4250 (odevixibat) included (0.001% and 0.03% w/w) for 1 week 
(n=5 in control group and n=6 in each treatment group). After one week, gain in body weight, 
macroscopic examination of organs, serum liver enzymes, liver weight, spleen weight, as well as 
hepatic and ileal mRNA analysis was performed to assess potential liver toxicity and effectiveness of 
IBAT inhibition by the 2 administered doses in wild-type mice. 
In 1-week pilot experiment, body weight as well as survival rate were not affected by the compound at 
either dose. There were no test article-related changes in serum liver enzymes or hepatic expression of 
pro-inflammatory gene tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), indicating that the test article was not 
hepatotoxic. However, odevixibat did repress expression of ileal FGF15 and induced hepatic CYP7A1 
expression by 2.5- to 3-fold. There were no test article-related alterations in serum total bile acid 
concentration, which might result from increased passive bile acid reabsorption from the colon, and no 
changes in bile salt export pump (BSEP) expression. 
In the experiment with male Mdr2-/- mice (n=5, 8 weeks old), animals received 0.03% (w/w) 
odevixibat in the diet for 4 weeks. Two control groups (n=5/group) were used: untreated Mdr2-/- mice 
and a positive control group of norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA)-fed Mdr2-/- mice dosed at 0.5% 
(w/w). Survival and serum hepatic enzyme levels were assessed after 2 weeks or 4 weeks of feeding. 
There was no mortality in any group. Liver weight/body weight ratio was increased in the norUDCA 
animals by about 33% but decreased by about 33% in the odevixibat-treated animals after 4 weeks 
(p<0.05 for both comparisons). Serum ALT levels were significantly decreased compared to untreated 
controls after 4 weeks of feeding (p<0.05) in both the norUDCA and odevixibat groups; aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) levels were increased 5-fold between 2 and 4 weeks of feeding in the 
untreated control animals but only 2- to 3-fold in the norUDCA and odevixibat groups. Levels of 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also decreased significantly in the odevixibat animals after 4 weeks of 
treatment. Serum bile acid concentrations were increased about 9-fold in the norUDCA animals 
Assessment report

compared to untreated controls after 2 or 4 weeks of dosing and levels of bilirubin were also increased 
by approximately 3-fold in the norUDCA animals compared to untreated controls. In contrast, levels of 
bile acids and bilirubin were similar between untreated control and odevixibat animals at both 2 and 4 
weeks of feeding. There was an increase in gallbladder size in norUDCA animals but not in untreated 
control or odevixibat animals after 4 weeks of dosing based on histopathological analysis.

cholestasis (Study ARR42500000117) 
A4250, Substance B (Cholestryamine), Substance C (Placebo). Faecal Evaluation Study in Dogs (Study 
74519) 
Oral administration of odevixibat (30 mg/kg) was performed on Days 1 and 4 followed immediately by 
rectal catheterisation in order to apply either cholestyramine suspension (Substance B) or placebo 
(Substance C) into the proximal part of colon (at doses of either 12 or 22 mL per animal). After dosing, 
the animals were housed individually and observed continuously during a 6-hour observation period. 
Faeces were evaluated for numbers of defecation and amount of passed faeces for each defecation. 
Faeces consistency was evaluated using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). Clinical signs, body 
weights, and food consumption were evaluated. Pre-treatment evaluation of normal defecation pattern 
and consistency was performed on Day -1. 
Oral treatment with odevixibat caused several episodes (1-6 per animal) of very soft to watery faeces 
(Score 6-7 on BSFS) in animals receiving placebo treatment with rectal administration. Rectal 
administration of cholestyramine suspension resulted in faeces with consistency scores of 5 or less 
(normal consistency in dogs), except for 1 animal (animal No. 4 on Day 1, cholestyramine suspension 
12 mL) which had 2 occasions of Score 7 (diarrhoea). 
In conclusion, evaluation of faeces from 4 dogs after receiving an oral dose of odevixibat demonstrated 
a clear tendency toward normalisation of number of defecations and normalisation of faeces 
consistency after rectal (intracolonic) treatment with cholestyramine suspension when compared with 
placebo treatment. The effect of cholestyramine treatment seemed to be more pronounced at 22 mL 
per animal compared to 12 mL per animal. 
AZD8294: Charcoal Propulsion Test in the Rat after Single Oral Administration (Study AA19205) 
Groups A, B, C, and D animals received the vehicle or odevixibat by the oral route. Group E animals 
received the reference item (morphine) by the subcutaneous (SC) route. Approximately 70 minutes 
after the test item or vehicle administration and approximately 45 minutes after reference item

administration, animals received a charcoal meal (at 1 mL/100 g body weight) of 10% charcoal 
suspension in 5% arabic gum in sterile water. Blood sampling was performed approximately 90 
minutes after odevixibat or reference item administration. 
After blood sampling, animals were euthanised and subjected to necropsy examination. The intestinal 
tract from the pylorus sphincter to the ileocecal junction was sampled. The intestinal transit was 
expressed as the percentage of the total intestinal tract length travelled by the charcoal test meal 20 
minutes after administration. No acute mortality was observed following administration of either 
vehicle or odevixibat. There were no significant effects on the total length of the intestinal tracts or 
intestinal transit of rats at any dose tested (1, 10, or 100 μmol/kg or 0.74, 7.41, or 74.09 mg/kg) 
compared to vehicle-treated animals. Morphine administered SC (20 mg/kg) significantly delayed 
intestinal transit of male Wistar rats 20 minutes after administration of a charcoal test meal, as 
compared to vehicle-treated animals. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
AZD8294 (odevixibat) is a potent inhibitor of the human ileal (apical) sodium/bile acid co-transporter 
(IC50=0.1 nM). To investigate the bioselectivity of odevixibat, the compound was tested in a panel of 
17 enzyme activity and binding assays along with 2 tissue models provided by MDS Pharma Services, 
Taiwan. This study was conducted by AstraZeneca in 2002. 
Odevixibat (1 μM) showed 66% inhibition of protein serine/threonine kinase, ERK2 in the first round of 
testing in the biochemical assays. No significant effect (>50% change) was seen in any of the other 16 
enzyme/receptor models assayed. When odevixibat was retested at 0.1 to 10 μM (74.09 to 7409 μg/L) 
in the ERK2 assay, no significant effect (>50%) was detected at any concentration. In addition, it was 
found that 1 μM odevixibat had no effect in the 2 tissue models (calcium channel of L-type and sodium 
channel site 2) tested.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro studies 
hERG channel (Study 0062SZ) 
hERG-expressing human embryonic kidney cells were recorded at approximately 20°C in the whole cell 
configuration of the patch clamp technique. Odevixibat and AR-H064965 were tested at unbound 
concentrations of 1 μM, and a positive control of 3 μM cisapride was also tested. For each cell 
recorded, data obtained in the presence of the test compound were expressed as a percentage of the 
inhibition produced by the positive control. Both odevixibat and AR-H064965 did not affect hERG 
channel activity at an unbound concentration of 1 μM (740.9 μg/L).

Odevixibat had no effects on the central nervous system (CNS) (Studies 20040102PGR, 20040103PGR, 
and 20040104PGR), respiratory system (Study 20040106PCR), renal function (Study 20040181PGR), 
or on cardiovascular parameters, including blood pressure and heart rate (Study 20040105PCR), at 
oral dosages (≤100 μmol/kg [≤74.09 mg/kg]) in rats. No haemodynamic effects on cardiovascular 
function and electrocardiogram morphology were seen in dogs following intravenous odevixibat 
administration (≤0.1 μmol/kg [≤74.09 μg/kg]). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical studies on pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interactions have not been conducted. Clinical 
studies on odevixibat and bile acid sequestrants are reported in the clinical study report (CSR) for 
A4250-001. The CHMP agrees with the applicant that in the presence of a clinical study investigating 
the co-administration of odevixibat and bile acid sequestrants, non-clinical studies to address a 
potential pharmacodynamic interaction can be waived.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism of odevixibat were studied in mouse, rat, dog, and human 
tissues in vitro and in mouse, rat, dog, marmoset, and human in vivo. Odevixibat toxicokinetics (TK) 
were determined in general toxicology studies conducted in mice (14-day and 13-week studies), rats 
(5- and 7-day, 1-month, and 26-week studies), dogs (7- and 14-day plus the 13- and 39-week 
studies), and marmosets (7-day study) and in rat and rabbit (embryo-foetal development studies at 
doses ranging from 10 to 300 mg/kg/day). 
Methods of analysis 
Non validated LC-MS/MS assays were used to analyse total plasma concentration of odevixibat in 
mouse and rat single-dose oral toxicity studies, 1-month oral toxicity studies in rats (calibration range 
3 to 1800 ng/mL), and a single-dose administration intravenous and oral PK study and a 7-day 
repeated daily oral toxicity study in marmoset (LLOQ 0.741 and 1.48 ng/mL). 
In the pivotal toxicity studies, validated LC-MS/MS assays were used to analyse total plasma 
concentration of odevixibat. LLOQ in these assays ranged from 0.1-0.76 ng/ml. Assay reproducibility 
was confirmed in incurred samples. 
It is noted that in several studies, the test item was found in plasma from control animals. Measured 
concentrations in control samples were sometimes even higher than the concentrations in treated 
groups. This is explained by the high nonselective binding of odevixibat to various types of labware and 
the absence of precautions to prevent contaminations in some of the studies.  
Distribution of radioactivity in rats was analysed by measuring radioactivity via liquid scintillation 
counting and quantitatively by whole-body autoradiography in rats. 
Absorption 
In vitro permeability and solubility studies indicate that odevixibat can be classified as a 
biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) Class 4 (low permeability and low solubility) substance. 
This is not considered an issue, since the site of action is locally in the gut and not systemic. 
Although a single-dose study in mouse was performed, no PK parameters were determined. The 
repeat-dose TK of odevixibat were evaluated in a 14 day (non-GLP) and a 13 week (GLP) oral toxicity 
study in CD-1 mice (dose levels 100-1500 mg/kg/day and 10-300 mg/kg/day, respectively). In 
general, Cmax was reached in 1-4 hours after administration. In both studies, exposure (Cmax as well 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 39/182 
 
 
 
as AUC0-24) increased sub-proportional to dose. The elimination half-life was between 1.9 and 4.5 h. 
No accumulation was observed after repeated dosing. No gender differences were observed. 
Also, in the single-dose PK study in rats, no PK parameters were determined. The repeat-dose TK of 
odevixibat were evaluated in a 7 day, 1 month (non-GLP) and a 26 week (GLP) oral toxicity study in 
Han Wistar rats (dose levels 10-1000 mg/kg/day, 10-1000 mg/kg twice daily and 10-300 mg/kg/day, 
respectively). The increase in exposure (based on AUC) to AZD8294 was less than proportional to the 
dose increase. The increase in Cmax was also less than proportional to increase in dose at most 
days/doses, except for 100 to 300 mg/kg on Days 1 and 177 in males and 10 to 100 mg/kg on Day 1 
in females, where the increase was greater than dose-proportional. On day 89, abnormal unexplained 
high exposures (Cmax and AUC) were observed in both males and females at the low dose (12-50x 
exposure at day 1 and day 177). Also, Tmax was much higher than on day 1 and day 177. No 
explanation was provided. For the other dose groups and timepoints, accumulation was minimal to low 
(0.8-4.9). The elimination half-life was between 5 and 11 hours. 
No single dose PK study was performed in dogs. The repeat-dose TK of odevixibat were evaluated in a 
7 day, 14 days, (non-GLP), 39 week (GLP) and a 13 weeks (non-GLP) oral toxicity study in beagle 
dogs (dose levels 1000, 30-1000, 3-150 mg/kg/day as a suspension in 20% v/v propylene glycol, and 
3-300 mg/kg as solid in gelatin capsules, respectively). Two-four times lower odevixibat exposures 
(Cmax and AUC) were observed for the gelatine capsule formulation relative to the suspension 
formulation at the 30 mg/kg dose level. In general, exposure (Cmax as well as AUC0-24) increased 
proportional or sub-proportional to dose. The elimination half-life was between 2 and 11 h. Some 
accumulation (0.5-4.5) was observed after repeated dosing. No gender differences were observed.PK 
parameters in the marmoset were analysed in a single dose study following oral administration of 18.5 
mg/kg or IV administration of 7.4 mg/kg b.w. A biphasic elimination was shown following IV 
administration. The t1/2, CL, and Vss were 8.6 hours, 7.5 mL/min/kg and 0.9 L/kg, respectively. 
Maximal exposure was reached 4 h after oral dosing and elimination seemed monophasic, probably 
due to the low absorption. Oral bioavailability was 0.9%. The repeat-dose TK of odevixibat were 
evaluated in a 7-day tolerability and oral toxicity study (dose levels 259 mg/kg/). In this study, Cmax 
was reached 1-3 h after dosing, and no accumulation was observed. DNAUC in the 7-day study was 
approximately 4 times lower than in the single-dose study after oral administration, indicating a 
subproportional increase to dose. 
Distribution 
The extent of plasma protein binding of odevixibat was evaluated in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, 
marmoset, and human plasma using ultracentrifugation and LC-MS/MS. Odevixibat was highly protein-
bound (>99% in most species and 98% in rabbit) Free concentrations were <0.4% in mouse and rat, 
0.6% in dog and human, 0.8% in marmoset and 2% in the rabbit. A minimal level of accumulation of 
odevixibat inside the blood cells was observed for nonclinical species and humans (blood to plasma 
ratio 0.48-0.60). 
Tissue distribution of odevixibat was investigated using quantitative whole-body autoradiography 
(QWBA) following a single iv administration of 2.5 μmol/kg [14C]-odevixibat (albino and pigmented 
rats) or a single oral dose of 5 μmol/kg (albino rats only).  
Following IV exposure, odevixibat was distributed throughout the body. After 5 minutes, high 
concentrations were observed in bile and liver, followed by blood; in other tissues (including CNS) the 
levels were below blood concentration. After 1 hour, the concentration of odevixibat-related material 
was decreased in all tissues, except in parts of the skin of the neck. No indication of melanin binding 
was observed in the pigmented rats. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 40/182 
 
 
 
Following oral exposure, odevixibat was poorly absorbed, and most of the radioactivity was found in 
the content of the gastro-intestinal tract (mostly in the gastric mucosa and in the wall of the small 
intestine). The concentration in blood was below the level of detection, and no radioactivity was 
observed in the CNS. Maximal levels were found after one hour in bile, skin, prostate gland, liver and 
renal cortex.  
The effects of odevixibat on placental transfer was assessed by QWBA in pregnant rats following a 
single iv dose of 2.5 μmol/kg odevixibat on gestational day 18. Odevixibat-related material was found 
in the placenta and amnion membrane but transfer to the foetus was limited (only low concentrations 
were found in the foetal liver at 4 hours after administration). Transfer to milk was not investigated. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies showed that 14C-A4250 is slowly metabolised by rat, mouse and human hepatocytes. 
Odevixibat metabolic turnover in all species was minimal and slow. Up to 6 metabolites were detected, 
of which 3 were monohydroxylated (M2, M3 and M6). All metabolites observed in human hepatocytes 
were also observed in animals. 
Due to the very low oral bioavailability of odevixibat, no in vivo metabolism studies were performed in 
animals. Following a clinically relevant dose of 5 μmol/kg, no radioactivity was detected in blood. The 
applicant, therefore, assumed that odevixibat would be predominantly excreted unchanged in faeces. 
Indeed, in humans following a 3 mg oral dose, no quantifiable radioactivity was detected in plasma and 
only very low amounts (<0.01%) in urine, whereas faeces contained >96% of total radioactivity as 
parent compound (within 48 hours). However, it is noted that intestinal metabolism in animals was not 
investigated. 
Excretion 
In rats, following administration of a single oral [14C]-A4250 dose at a target level of 4 mg/kg, 
excretion was almost exclusively via the faeces (88.6%), with the majority being excreted during the 
first 48 hours after dosing (87.8%). Excretion via urine is less than 0.1%. In humans, 83% is excreted 
via faeces. At least in humans, the majority (>96%) is excreted as the parent compound. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
In safety pharmacology studies, odevixibat formulated in sodium bicarbonate buffer solution, whereas 
odevixibat as a suspension in 20% v/v propylene glycol in purified water was used in the TK/toxicity 
studies. Nevertheless, exposure at doses of 10 and 100 μmol/kg ( 7.4, and 74 mg/kg) were 
comparable in safety pharmacology and toxicity studies. At the lowest dose (1 μmol/kg), exposure was 
in general below LOQ. 
In an EFD study in rats with dose levels of 100-1000 mg/kg, exposure in pregnant dams was similar to 
that in non-pregnant rats. Both in the EFD study in rats as the EFD study in rabbits (dose levels 10-
100 mg/kg), exposure increased in a dose-proportional to sub-dose proportional manner and there 
was no to minimal accumulation after repeated dosing. 
In a PPND study in rats with dose levels 10-1000 mg/kg, mean plasma concentrations in pups on PND 
4 and PND 20 represented 3.3% to 52.1% of concentrations in dams, irrespective of dose and 
occasion. However, odevixibat was also observed in 5 out of 17 control pup samples, at similar 
concentrations as in the low dose group. Although it was concluded that contamination probably 
occurred ex-vivo and control animals had not been inadvertently dosed, also the results of the dosed 
pups are unreliable due to the probable ex-vivo contamination. 
In a juvenile toxicity study in rats with doses of 10-100 mg/kg/day, it was shown that peak and 
systemic exposure were markedly lower after repeated administration, relative to single-dose

exposure. This observation is not unexpected as the rat GI tract is known to be immature for the first 2 
weeks of life, and after this period undergoes significant development, especially around weaning. The 
GI tract in humans is more significantly developed at birth than in rats, and as outlined in Downes et 
al., (Downes, 2017) TK data in juvenile rats between days 10 and 21 are unlikely to be a good 
indicator of likely clinical bioavailability. Given the absence of new toxicities or increased sensitivity in 
the juvenile rats, the provided study is supportive of an indication in a paediatric population from 6 
months of age. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and mice, with a single dose of 2000 mg/kg. There 
were no major toxicities seen, although the interpretation of the studies is difficult due the lack of a 
control group and small number of animals.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity of odevixibat was investigated in mice, rats, dogs and marmosets.

In repeat-administration studies across the rodent (mouse and rat) and non-rodent (dog and 
marmoset) species, odevixibat administration was generally well tolerated, with in-life findings 
(periodic diarrhoea, emesis, salivation, and reductions in body weight/weight gain and/or food 
consumption) and minor clinical pathology alterations (reductions in plasma proteins, albumin, total 
cholesterol, and/or lipoproteins) noted. No deaths attributed to odevixibat occurred in the mouse 
(female only), rat, dog, or marmoset. Mortality/moribundity in male mice was noted, starting on Day 
52, in a 13-week GLP repeat-administration study at 300 mg/kg/day. Morbidity in rabbits is detailed 
later in this document. The GI tract was the primary target organ of toxicity in adult animals. Drug-
related target organ toxicity included the GI tract (mouse, rat, and dog), gallbladder (mouse), kidney 
(rat), parotid gland acinar cells (rat), cardiovascular system (embryo-foetal rabbit), and the liver (adult 
and juvenile rats). Therefore, following both single and repeat administration, clinical symptomatology 
was primarily GI, with associated reductions in body weight and/or food consumption.

Table 14: Study TEA0015; carcinogenicity evaluation in rat 
The design for Study TEA0015 is presented below:  
In this GLP-compliant study, groups of 50/sex/group Han Wistar rats were dosed with 0 (water control), 
0 (vehicle control—20% v/v PG in purified water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day odevixibat, once daily, by 
gavage at a dose volume of 5 mL/kg body weight for at least 104 weeks, until the day before necropsy. 
Separate groups of animals (3/sex/group) received the same dosages, as above, for proof of exposure.  
Exposure to odevixibat was detected at all dosage levels at 1 and 24 hours after dosing (Table 15). 
Exposure generally increased with increasing dose. There was no appreciable difference in exposures 
between blood sampling occasions or sex:  
Table 15: 
Concentrations of odevixibat, slightly above the LLOQ (0.500 ng/mL), were detected in approximately 
half of the vehicle control plasma samples obtained during Weeks 13 and 26. The presence of odevixibat 
ranged from concentrations just above the LLOQ to values 8-fold higher (0.510 to 3.89 ng/mL). Although 
a causative mechanism could not be determined, odevixibat was detected at very low levels only and 
was considered not to impact the study outcome or any conclusions drawn from the data. 
Assessment report

There  were  no  clinical  observations  or  effects  on  body  weight  and  food  intake  that  were  related  to 
administration  of  odevixibat.  There  were  no  test  item-related  ocular  findings  and  no  effects  on 
haematology parameters that were considered to be of toxicological significance. Reductions in plasma 
cholesterol and lipoproteins (HDL and/or LDL) were noted in odevixibat-treated males at all dosage levels 
in  comparison  to  water  and  vehicle  controls;  these  changes  were  not  considered  toxicologically 
significant. There was no effect of odevixibat on survival of either sex over the course of the study and 
there was no test item-related increase in the incidence of any factor that may have been contributory 
to the death of the animals. 
Table 16: 
There were no macroscopic findings or neoplastic changes (i.e. incidence, location, or size of the palpable 
masses) that were considered to be related to administration of odevixibat. 
There was an exposure-related increase in incidence of non-neoplastic lesions in the kidney (hyperplasia 
of the urothelium and associated mineralisation in the pelvis) and liver (biliary hyperplasia and basophilic 
foci  of  alteration).  These  changes  showed  no  signs  of  advancing  towards  a  proliferative  lesion,  were 
considered to be non-adverse and not to represent a neoplastic risk.

Table 17: 
Odevixibat administered once daily by gavage to the rat at dosage levels up to 100 mg/kg/day did not 
affect survival and there was no odevixibat-related increase in the incidence of any factor that may have 
been contributory to the death of the animals. There were no clinical signs, effects on body weight or 
food intake, ophthalmoscopic findings, or changes in haematological parameters related to odevixibat. 
Slight decreases in plasma cholesterol and related parameters (HDL and/or LDL) in males (all dosages) 
were  considered  non-adverse.  Odevixibat  administration  at  dosages  of  up  to  100  mg/kg/day  did  not 
cause the formation of neoplastic lesions. There was an increase in the incidence of non-neoplastic lesions 
in the kidney (hyperplasia of the urothelium and associated mineralisation in the pelvis) and liver (biliary 
hyperplasia and basophilic foci of alteration). These non-adverse changes showed no signs of advancing 
towards a proliferative lesion and were, therefore, not considered to represent a neoplastic risk. On this 
basis, the NOEL for tumour formation in this study was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day, the highest 
dosage  administered  to  both  males  and  females.  At  the  NOEL  during  Week  26  at  1  hour  post-dose, 
confirmation of plasma exposure was 80.2 and 29.3 ng/mL for males and females, respectively.

Table 18: 
In this pivotal (GLP-compliant) study (TEA0016), groups of 54/sex/group CD-1 mice were administered 
0 (water control), 0 (vehicle control—20% v/v PG in purified water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day odevixibat 
once daily by gavage (10  mL/kg body weight) for at least 104 weeks, until the day before necropsy. 
Satellite  animals  (6/sex/group)  received  the  same  dosages  and  were  sampled  for  proof  of  exposure 
during Weeks 13 and 26.  
Exposure to odevixibat was detected in all dosage levels at 1 hour after dosing and generally, for the 30 
and 100 mg/kg/day groups, at 24 hours after dosing. Exposure generally increased with increasing dose. 
There was no appreciable difference in exposure between blood sampling occasions or sex: 
Table 19: 
Concentrations of odevixibat that were slightly above the LLOQ (0.500 ng/mL) were detected in 2 mice 
in the vehicle control group in plasma samples obtained during Week 26: Female 565 at 1 hour after 
dosing (0.500 ng/mL) and Male 544 at 24 hours after dosing (0.711 ng/mL). The presence of odevixibat 
in the 1-hour sample was 40-fold lower than the lowest concentration measured in dosed animals at the 
same  time  point  (21.9  ng/mL);  the  24-hour  sample  concentration  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  dosed 
animals at the same time point (0.602 to 15.8 ng/mL). Since odevixibat was detected in only 2 control

animals and at very low levels, these observations were not considered to impact the study outcome or 
any conclusions drawn from the data. 
There were no clinical observations related to administration of odevixibat. Reductions in body weight 
gain were seen for both sexes given either 30 and 100 mg/kg/day (between 13% and 25% compared 
to concurrent control groups). In general, there was inconsistent correlation with food intake in males, 
and  only  slightly  lower  food  intake  seen  for  females  given  100  mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  test  item-
related ocular findings or effects on haematology parameters. 
There was no effect of odevixibat on survival of either sex over the course of the study and there was 
no test-item related increase in the incidence of any factor that may have been contributory to the death 
of the animals: 
Table 20: 
Other  than  microscopic  changes  in  the  gallbladder,  there  were  no  other  macroscopic  or  neoplastic 
findings (i.e. incidence, location, or size of the palpable masses) that were considered to be related to 
administration of odevixibat. There was an odevixibat-related increase in the incidence of non-adverse, 
non-neoplastic lesions in the gallbladder (cystic hyperplasia and basophilic amorphous contents) at all 
dosage levels and in both early decedents and terminal sacrifice animals. Cystic hyperplasia was seen in 
a  combined  total  of  6  control  animals  (sexes  combined)  and  was  seen  for  12  to  26  animals  in  each 
odevixibat group. Basophilic amorphous content was seen in a combined total of 9 control animals (sexes 
combined) and was seen for 24 to 39 animals in each odevixibat group. The incidence of both findings 
was statistically significant for both sexes and at all dosages. Incidence was slightly higher in terminal 
sacrifice animals, suggesting a late onset. These appeared to be reactive changes without evidence of 
proliferative advancement and were considered to be non-adverse and without neoplastic risk. 
Odevixibat when administered once daily by gavage to the mouse at dosage levels up to 100 mg/kg/day 
did not affect survival. There were no test item-related ocular findings and no test item-related changes 
in haematology parameters. Odevixibat administration at dosages of up to 100 mg/kg/day did not cause 
the formation of neoplastic lesions. There was an increase in the incidence of non-neoplastic lesions in 
the  gallbladder  (cystic  hyperplasia  and  basophilic  amorphous  contents)  for  both  sexes  at  all  dosage 
levels.  These  apparently  late-onset,  non-adverse  changes  showed  no  signs  of  advancing  towards  a 
proliferative lesion and were, therefore, not considered to represent a neoplastic risk. On this basis, the 
NOEL  for  tumour  formation  in  this  study  was  considered  to  be  100  mg/kg/day,  the  highest  dosage 
Assessment report

administered to both males and females. At the NOEL on Week 26 at 1 hour post-dose, confirmation of 
plasma exposure was 108 and 192 ng/mL for males and females, respectively.  
Table 21: 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity of odevixibat was investigated in rats and rabbits. It included 
a segment I fertility study in rats, segment II studies in rats and rabbits, a segment III study in rats, 
and the juvenile animal study with rats (including dose-range finding studies). In rats, in the FEED and 
EFD studies no effects on fertility and development were seen up to and including the highest tested 
dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. The delayed ossification of several bones (i.e. squamosal, metacarpal, 
sternebrae and caudal vertebral arches) and thick ribs observed in the EFD study in odevixibat-treated 
animals are considered non-adverse and rather related to the early necropsy timepoint (GD 20 instead 
of GD 21). On the contrary, two available DRF studies in non-pregnant and pregnant New Zealand 
White rabbits and the pivotal EFD study in rabbits revealed maternal toxicity at dose levels ≥ 30 
mg/kg/day, manifested as reduced faecal output, reduced food consumption and body weight, with 
one dose at 30 mg/kg/day and one dose at 100 mg/kg/day in the EFD study sacrificed in extremis 
after aborting/delivering early. Increased incidence of the front pow hyperflexion was seen in the DRF 
and the pivotal study, suggesting the relationship with the treatment. In the DRF study, this effect was 
not observed in controls; however, in the pivotal study, it was also seen in 2 (2) foetuses (litters) of 
the controls (0.9%). The effect may have thus been related to the teratogenicity of the vehicle (20% 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 51/182 
 
 
 
 
 
propylene glycol); however, in the DRF study, the incidences in the odevixibat-treated groups 
significantly exceeded historical control ranges (4.7%, 8.2% and 6.3%, resp., vs 0.57% in historical 
controls) whereas the effect was not seen in concurrent controls. Thus, the relationship with odevixibat 
treatment seems more plausible.  
Starting from 10 mg/kg/day cardiovascular effects were seen in the foetuses of the pivotal study 
(primarily ventricular diverticulum (described as a “five-chambered heart”), small ventricle and dilated 
aortic arch), compared to 0 in controls. Although no clear dose-response was seen, the observed 
effects, particularly five-chambered heart, are rare, were seen across all treated groups and the 
observed incidence was outside the historical control data range. In view of this, these effects are 
considered to be related to odevixibat treatment. A number of external (primarily neural tube defects) 
and skeletal (primarily sternebrae defects) malformations were seen in the pivotal study in both 
controls and the treated animals at incidences exceeding historical control data. It is therefore possible 
that these effects were related to the teratogenicity of the vehicle (20% propylene glycol). Based on 
the observed cardiovascular effects at all dose levels in the rabbit study, the NOAEL for prenatal 
developmental toxicity cannot be established and is considered < 10 mg/kg/day. This dose level 
corresponded to AUC0-24 of 4.57-6.28 ng x h/mL, comparable with the anticipated exposure in 
humans administered the therapeutic dose of odevixibat, with the therapeutic margin at the maternal 
NOAEL ≤1.0-fold the MRHD. It is known that rabbits are sensitive to changes in the GI tract microbiota 
and are also known for their coprophagous behaviour which in combination with the decreased faecal 
output could have resulted in higher local exposure to odevixibat. However, the coprophagous 
behaviour was not specifically recorded in the study, and the reduced faecal output appeared to be 
related to the reduced food consumption.  
Based on these results, section 5.3 of the SmPC states that odevixibat had no effect on the 
reproductive performance, fertility, embryo-foetal development, or prenatal/postnatal development 
studies in rats at the exposure multiple of 133 of the anticipated clinical exposure (based on total 
plasma odevixibat AUC0-24), including juveniles (exposure multiple of 63 of the anticipated human 
exposure). The presence of odevixibat in breast milk was not measured in animal studies. Exposure 
was demonstrated in the pups of lactating dams in the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity 
study with rats (3.2-52.1% of the odevixibat plasma concentration of the lactating dams). It is 
therefore possible that odevixibat is present in breast milk. 
Toxicokinetic data 
In the EFD study in rat, the therapeutic margin at the maternal NOAEL was at least 47-fold the 
maximum recommended human dosage (MRHD) (Table 1). At this dose there was a slight increase in 
delayed ossification when the foetuses were examined on GD 20. Ossification delays, such as those 
noted, disappear with continued development and have no toxicological consequence. 
In the EFD study in rabbits, the maternal (conservative) NOAEL was the low dosage of 10 mg/kg/day, 
while the NOAEL for embryo-foetal toxicity was <10 mg/kg/day. The therapeutic margin at the 
maternal NOAEL was therefore ≤ 1.0-fold the MRHD (Table 1). Based on evaluation of the rat and 
rabbit embryofoetal studies (DART Expert Report 30SEP2020 the developmental and reproductive 
toxicology (DART) expert report authors considered the teratogenic risk for odevixibat in humans low. 
However, at present, in the absence of an embryofoetal NOAEL in the rabbit and the variability of the 
exposure values, the association of odevixibat treatment and the incidence of cardiovascular anomalies 
cannot be excluded, but more information on these events will be collected in the post-authorisation 
phase in the agreed safety studies.

Following a single administration on PND 14 at the 100 mg/kg/day dosage in the pivotal juvenile 
toxicity study, the (free) therapeutic margin of safety was 2550- and 3610-fold relative to the human 
MRHD for males and female rats, respectively. On the last day of dosing (Day 63; similar to human 
adulthood) the (free) therapeutic margin of safety in male and female rats at the 100-mg/kg/day 
dosage was 38- and 15-fold, respectively (see table 22)

*Following the maximum recommended clinical dosage, the highest observed Cmax values in human 
plasma were 1.1 ng/mL total and 0.0066 ng/mL unbound. The highest observed AUC0-24 values in 
human plasma were 25 ng·h/L total and 0.15 ng·h/L unbound. 
Interspecies comparison 
The TK of odevixibat were characterised during nonclinical safety studies. Following oral 
administration, odevixibat was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax of 
generally 1 to 4 hours; 1 to 8 hours in gravid and juvenile rats) in all nonclinical species evaluated 
(mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and marmoset). In general, mouse, rat, and dog exposures (both AUC and 
Cmax) in toxicology studies increased in an approximately dose-proportional, or less than dose-
proportional, manner and remained consistent with repeated dosing (≤3-fold accumulation), thereby 
demonstrating little evidence for a change in clearance with time. In general, gravid rats and rabbits 
displayed similar toxicokinetics to their non-gravid counterparts. At 1 hour following oral odevixibat 
administration to rat dams on LD 4 in the pre- and postnatal development studies (non-GLP [Study 
AB22203] and GLP [Study AB22204]), drug exposure in pups (PND 4) was highly variable (3 to 52%) 
compared to the maternal plasma concentration and was generally less than proportional to dosage. 
Local Tolerance  
Odevixibat is intended to be given orally in humans. The local tolerance in the intestine has been 
evaluated in the standard toxicity studies by oral administration of high doses of odevixibat. Assessing 
local tolerance using other routes of administration, e.g. subcutaneous, intravenous, inhalation, 
intravitreal (ophthalmic), have not been deemed relevant and have not been performed. This was 
accepted by the CHMP. 
Other toxicity studies 
Unlike therapeutic protein products (e.g. antibodies, peptides), small molecules such as odevixibat are 
not expected to generate an immune response. Thus, antigenicity studies have not been performed. 
This was accepted by the CHMP. 
The risk of immunotoxicity has been evaluated based on results from the standard toxicity studies. No 
obvious signs in related organs have been detected in response to odevixibat treatment (e.g. changes 
in thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow). Altered haematology and incidence of infection have 
not been detected. Neither IBAT specifically nor bile acids in general are expected to perturb 
immunological responses. No signs of immunological reactions have been seen in clinical trials thus far. 
Based on the outcome from the standard toxicity studies, the minimal systemic exposure, and the 
general profile and mechanism of action of odevixibat, the risk of immunotoxicity has been considered 
low and dedicated immunotoxicity studies have not been performed. Due to the lack of adverse effects 
on the immune system, the lack if dedicated immunotoxicity studies was accepted by the CHMP.

Odevixibat has a molar extinction coefficient >1000 L/mol/cm within the range of natural light (290-
700 nm). Per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S101 guidance, a phototoxicity study 
[Study 20243334] was performed to determine the effects of repeat administration of odevixibat on 
the eyes and skin of pigmented rats. There was no evidence of ocular (confirmed by histopathology) or 
cutaneous phototoxicity after administration of odevixibat at oral dosages up to 1000 mg/kg/day that 
were followed approximately 4 hours later by a single exposure to UVR/Sham UVR.  
No dedicated studies on impurities have been performed. Whilst the proposed levels of some of the 
impurities are higher than those seen in the batches used in the toxicity study, taking into account the 
significantly higher doses used in these studies the absolute amounts of the specified impurities are 
significantly higher than the levels associated with the proposed specifications at the maximum clinical 
dose of 7.2 mg/day. Therefore, the proposed specification levels are considered qualified.

Calculation

basis of public literature 
The applicant has calculated the PECsw based on a dose of 8.4 mg/patient/day. However, in the SmPC 
a maximum dose of 7.2 mg/patient/day is given. Therefore, the calculations of the applicant can be 
considered as the worst case. Furthermore, the current application is for the indication of PFIC only, as 
the PECsw for PFIC is 0.00008 µg/L, well below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, a further assessment is 
not deemed necessary. 
Odevixibat was considered a potentially PBT and hence, the applicant provided a document with an 
expert opinion on the issue. The expert concluded that the partitioning value of the dissociated 
molecule at pH 7 (logDow value of 2.99) is the preferred value to use in the PBT screening 
assessment. The applicant concluded that, as this value is below the PBT assessment trigger value of 
4.5, no further PBT assessment is considered warranted. The CHMP concluded that overall, the neutral

molecule screens as a potential PBT/vPvB substance, but as the neutral form is predominantly present 
at very low pH values, the log Dow¬ at environmentally relevant pH values is not close to the trigger 
value of >4.5. Therefore, it can be agreed that a further PBT/vPvB assessment is not deemed 
necessary.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics: The PK and metabolism of odevixibat were studied in mouse, rat, dog, and human 
tissues in vitro and in mouse, rat, dog, marmoset, and human in vivo. Odevixibat TK were determined 
in general toxicology studies conducted in mice, rats, dogs, and marmosets and in rat and rabbit 
(embryo-foetal development studies at doses ranging from 10 to 300 mg/kg/day). In the single-dose 
PK study, on day 89, abnormal unexplained high exposures (Cmax, AUC) were observed in both males 
and females at the low dose (12-50x exposure at day 1 and day 177). Also, Tmax was much higher on 
day 89 (both in 10 and 100 mg/kg dose groups) than on day 1 and day 177. This is due to high 8-hour 
and 24-hour post-dose concentrations. Without these data, the concentration-time curve of day 89 
looks similar to those of day 1 and day 177. Since the majority of the data consistently show that 
odevixibat is poorly absorbed, the aberrant observations do not impact the integrity or the outcome of 
the study. 
Toxicology: Repeated dose toxicity of odevixibat was investigated in mice, rats, dogs and marmosets. 
Odevixibat was well-tolerated in general in mice, rats and dogs. Toxicity target organs were GI tract in 
mice and dogs. In rats, no target organs were identified. Other effects were related to the 
pharmacological action of odevixibat as an IBAT inhibitor. A decrease in spleen weight was seen after 
39 weeks of treatment in males and females in all dose groups with exposures below those in humans, 
which was persistent until the end of the 4-week recovery period. However, a relation to treatment is 
unlikely due to the lack of dose-response, high inter-animal variation, lack of any macroscopic or 
microscopic correlate, and spleen weights that were within the historical control range of the test site.  
Carcinogenicity: Carcinogenicity was tested in two 104-week rat and mouse studies up to a dose level 
of 100 mg/kg/day. A number of neoplastic changes for which statistically significantly increased 
incidences were observed, were reported in both studies. In rats, those included leiomyoma of 
duodenum and mammary fibroadenoma in females and adrenal phaeochromocytomas and pituitary 
adenomas/adenocarcinomas in males; in mice, skin/subcutis fibromas/fibrosarcoma’s in females and 
pituitary adenomas/adenocarcinomas in males. These lesions either occurred at a low incidence/seen 
only in one sex, or showed no dose-response relationship, or were commonly occurring in the ageing 
animals and thus not related to treatment. As duodenum leiomyoma is quite a rare tumour occurring 
at the site where local exposure to odevixibat can be expected to be significant, however, leiomyoma is 
a smooth muscle tumour; thus, it is not likely that the direct exposure of this tissue would occur in the 
absence of significant epithelial erosion/ulceration. Furthermore, no treatment-related microscopic 
lesions were in other sections of gastro-intestinal tract, where also high local concentration of 
odevixibat could be expected. This suggests that the observed effect is not treatment-related and is 
thus not considered to be clinically relevant.  
Considering the pharmacology of the compound as an inhibitor of bile salt reabsorption, the findings of 
cystic hyperplasia of the gall bladder in mice and liver biliary hyperplasia in rats are of particular 
interest. The applicant has provided additional literature data demonstrating that odevixibat at dose 
level of 16 mg/kg/day reduced the elevated serum bile acids and the bile duct proliferation in the 
MDR2 knockout mice. It was suggested by the applicant that odevixibat may have a beneficial 
antiproliferative effect on cholangiocytes by reducing the bile duct load, and that the effects seen in 
carcinogenicity studies were high-dose phenomena seen in healthy animals having normal bile duct 
physiology, as opposed to the PFIC patients. Overall, the applicant’s argumentation is endorsed by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 56/182 
 
 
 
CHMP. It is also noted that the severity of the observed lesions was low in both species 
(minimal/slight) and did not appear to increase with the increased exposure. In rats, bile duct 
hyperplasia is known to occur upon aging and has a low chance of progression to neoplasia or 
significant alteration of hepatic function. According to the review of Hailey et al., minimal “typical” 
biliary epithelial hyperplasia alone or with very minimal associated inflammatory cell infiltrate and/or 
hepatocellular changes may be considered non-adverse in the rat in nonclinical safety studies. In mice, 
gallbladder hyperplasia is usually caused by irritation of gallbladder mucosa due to xenobiotic 
exposure. Furthermore, the effects in both species occurred at exposure multiple of 114 (rat) or 35 
(mouse) of the anticipated clinical exposure, therefore it is agreed by the CHMP that they do not 
represent a safety concern in clinical settings.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity of odevixibat was investigated in rats and rabbits. It included 
a segment I fertility study in rats, segment II studies in rats and rabbits, a segment III study in rats, 
and the juvenile animal study with rats (including dose-range finding studies). No adverse effects were 
noted in rats. Rabbits seem to be sensitive for odevixibat-related developmental toxicity effects. 
Teratogenic effects (cardio-vascular system) were observed in the absence of clear maternal toxicity. 
Exposure levels measured in the study were much lower than in rats at the same dose levels and 
comparable to the expected clinical exposure. Decreased faecal output and coprophagous behaviour of 
the rabbits could have resulted in higher local exposure to odevixibat. In addition, it is known that 
rabbit as species is sensitive to changes in the GI tract microbiota. The applicant was asked to 
elaborate on the potential mechanism of the findings in the rabbit developmental toxicity study, 
considering all the above noted issues and discussing their clinical relevance. The applicant stated that 
based on available data it is currently not possible to envisage the mechanism of the observed effects; 
however, he suggested that the teratogenic risk of odevixibat in humans is low based on the following 
main considerations: 1) the absence of the dose-response relationship; 2) the spontaneous occurrence 
of the observed malformations in rabbits; 3) possible issues with the treated does due to the body 
weight loss seen in the 10 and 100 mg/kg/day does on days 0-6 (pre-treatment); and 4) exposure 
margin of 10.5 based on free odevixibat plasma concentration. However, although is the CHMP agrees 
with the applicant that no clear evidence of the dose-response relationship was seen in the study, the 
observed findings occurred across all dose levels and concerned different females and different 
foetuses, making an association with the test item probable. Furthermore, based on the provided 
historical control data, the observed findings are very rare, and some were not reported at all. 
Regarding the reduced body weight in the 10 and 100 mg/kg/day does, it is concluded by the CHMP 
that the body weight reduction occurred on GD6-9 of the treatment, thus when the treatment was 
initiated. The applicant further calculated the exposure margins of 3.08 and 10.5 based on the total 
and free fraction odevixibat plasma AUC0-24 in humans of 2.04 and 0.012 ng x h/mL, respectively. 
However, the chosen AUC0-24 values disagree with the simulated AUC0-24 and Cmax values, which have 
submitted by the applicant based on the results of the PK modelling as a response to the first round of 
questions and accepted by the CHMP. The new AUC0-24 and Cmax values for the total odevixibat which 
have been included in the updated SmPC Section 5.3 are 5.99 ng x g/mL and 0.623 ng/mL. It is 
therefore logical to use the same values to calculate the exposure margins. Furthermore, considering 
the very high degree of protein binding by odevixibat in plasma, the comparison based on total 
exposure, rather than exposure to the unbound fraction, is considered more appropriate. Using these 
values, the exposure margins of 1.1 and 1.6 are calculated based on AUC0-24 and Cmax of the total 
odevixibat. Therefore, it is concluded that the observed cardiovascular malformations in rabbit foetuses 
are caused by odevixibat treatment and adequate statement has been included in the SmPC, section 
5.3.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the nonclinical programme was well designed and performed. The toxicology programme 
revealed primarily effects related to the pharmacological action of odevixibat. Adverse reactions not 
observed in clinical studies but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels 
and with possible relevance to clinical use are teratogenic effects seen in rabbits. Odevixibat caused 
cardiovascular defects in developing rabbit foetuses (primarily ventricular diverticulum, small ventricle 
and dilated aortic arch) at exposure multiples of 1.1 and 1.6 of the anticipated clinical exposure, based 
on AUC0-24 and Cmax of total odevixibat, respectively, and an adequate statement has been included 
in the SmPC to inform the prescribing physician. 
From a non-clinical point of view, the marketing authorisation of Bylvay can be granted.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of odevixibat was evaluated in three Phase 1 studies in healthy adults and one 
Phase 2 study in paediatric patients with cholestatic pruritus. These studies were conducted to support 
dose selection and to characterise the single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics in children 
(A4250-003) and adults (A4250-001), to evaluate the impact of food (A4250-004) and to assess 
the interaction potential of odevixibat (A4250-013). In the Phase 3 study A4250-005 sparse PK 
sampling was performed; these PK samples were included in the population PK analysis ALBI-PMX-
A4250-1167_PPK. 
Further the applicant conducted an ADME study (A4250-007) to assess the mass balance recovery 
and the metabolite profile of odevixibat. Several in vitro studies were conducted to assess the role of 
different transporters and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes on the fate of odevixibat and the 
interaction potential of odevixibat. 
Methods 
In the phase 1 studies, rich sampling schemes were implemented to collect pharmacokinetic samples. 
Generally sampling was dense in the first 4 hours after administration (at least 1 sample/hour) and 
less frequent up to 24 hours after administration. Further, PD samples were collected to monitor the 
pharmacodynamic effects of odevixibat.  
A LC-MS/MS assay (method QBR111522QB0) was used to quantify odevixibat concentrations in 
human plasma in the concentration range of 0.05-50.0 ng/mL. This assay was appropriately validated, 
an acceptable within-run and between run accuracy and precision was shown. Although the 
concentration of odevixibat was undetectable in about half of the clinical PK samples, the assay is 
considered suitable for the detection of odevixibat as the observed Cmax of the highest administered 
odevixibat dose was around 0.5 ng/mL (about 10-fold higher than the lowest quantifiable 
concentration (0.05 ng/ml)) and at least 2 QC sample levels fell within the range of concentrations 
measured in study samples. 
Several bioanalytical methods were developed to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of odevixibat. 
The concentrations of the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) hydroxy-4-cholensten-3-one (C4) , total 
and individual bile acids, autotaxin/LPA were determined in various matrices (plasma, urine, faeces, 
whole blood and serum) and standard liver function test measurements (ASAT, ALAT, GGT, AFT, dBili, 
tBili) were conducted. These assays were generally appropriately validated, an acceptable within-run 
and between run accuracy and precision was shown. 
Non-compartmental methods have been used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
odevixibat in the phase 1 studies. However, because the plasma levels of odevixibat were often not 
quantifiable, the pharmacokinetic parameters could not be determined for all subjects. 
The population PK analysis ALBI-PMX-A4250-1167_PPK of odevixibat was performed based on 
Phase 1 studies in healthy adult subjects (A4250-001, A4250-004, and A4250-013) and Phase 2/3 
studies in paediatric patients (A4250-003 and A4250-005). Due to the limited availability of detectable 
PK samples, the population model is mainly driven by data from studies A4250-004 and A4250-013. 
Population PK modelling and simulations were performed using NONMEM.  
A total of 105 adult and 53 paediatric subjects were included in the population PK analysis. As the 
concentration of odevixibat was not detectable in about half of the study samples, the model 
accounted for the samples BLQ, using the likelihood method M3, as published by Beal SL, 20011.

The PK of odevixibat was described using a one-compartment model with linear elimination. The 
population PK model included a first- and second-rate constant of absorption to characterise double 
peak absorption profiles (Ka1 and Ka2, respectively). Covariates included in the final model were 
bodyweight on CL/F, P-gp inhibitors and liver impairment on CL/F, body weight on V/F, dosage form 
and formulation on relative bioavailability (Frel), and formulation on Ka1. 
Quality-of-fit of the base and final PK models was evaluated using a standard model discrimination 
process including statistical criteria such as minimum objective function value (OFV) as well as 
pertinent graphical representations of goodness-of-fit (e.g. observed vs predicted(PRED), CWRES vs 
PRED or time).  
The methodology used to construct the data set is considered acceptable and PK model appears to 
describe the observed data reasonably well. Typical values of PK parameters derived with the final 
population PK model of odevixibat are presented in Table 2624. The typical apparent clearance (CL/F), 
volume of distribution (V/F) and elimination half-life (t1/2) of odevixibat in a typical 70-kg subject 
were 2180 L/h, 2510 L and 0.798 h (corresponding to 47.9 min), respectively. The VPC plot of the 
concentration-time profiles of odevixibat in the overall population, including the probability of 
undetectable concentrations, is presented in Figure 44.

Physical-chemical properties 
Odevixibat has a low but pH-dependent solubility, with ionization constants pKa 3.84 and 9.64 and has 
a low permeability; thus, it can be classified as a BCS IV-drug. Odevixibat has 2 chiral centres and is 
manufactured as a single stereoisomer with the S,R-configuration. 
Absorption  
Low bioavailability of odevixibat was observed in clinical studies. In the mass balance study A4250-
007 about 83% of the administered oral dose was recovered in 216 hours. An average of 0.002% of 
the total radioactivity was recovered from the urine, and 82.886% was recovered from the faeces. 
Also, in single and multiple-dose studies A4250-001 and A4250-003, the relative bioavailability is

estimated to be low. In many of the study samples, no quantifiable plasma concentrations of 
odevixibat were obtained, and no PK parameters were calculated in these two studies. 
The SmPC presents noncompartmental pharmacokinetic data obtained in DDI study A4250-013, in 
healthy adult volunteers (see Table 25: Summary of Odevixibat Pharmacokinetic Parameters following 
a single oral dose of 7,2mg odevixibat in healthy adult [PK Evaluable Population] study A4250-013

odevixibat, thus following administration of the first meal.

In vitro study, XT168064 showed that odevixibat is a substrate for the gastrointestinal efflux 
transporter P-gp, but not for BCRP. 
The exposure of odevixibat was calculated for the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day dose levels in the target 
population, paediatric patients with PFIC (study A4250-005), using the population model. The mean 
Cmax of odevixibat in paediatric patients treated with the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day dose were 0.211 and 
0.623 ng/mL, respectively, and their mean AUCs were 2.26 and 5.99 ng*hr/mL, respectively.

Three different odevixibat formulations have been used in the clinical studies, formulation A, B, and C. 
The main differences were the drug substance crystallinity and the strengths of the formulations; 
formulation C is identical to the to-be-marketed formulation. In the population PK study, differences in 
absorption have been observed between early formulation A relative to formulation B and C. As this 
formulation has only been used in the early SD/MD dose-finding study A4250-001 and not in the 
Phase 2 or 3 studies, the difference is not considered relevant for the interpretation of the clinical 
safety and efficacy data. 
The effect of food on odevixibat was studied by assessing the PK of a single dose of odevixibat (9.6 
mg) in a randomized, 3-way crossover design in 17 healthy adults under fasting and fed (high-fat, 
high-calorie meal, 800 - 1 000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal 
from fat) conditions and when sprinkled on applesauce (study A4250-004). Exposure to odevixibat 
was lower in both the fed state (decrease of 72% and 62% in Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively) and when 
dosed as a sprinkled formulation on applesauce (decrease of 39% and 36% in Cmax and AUC0-24, 
respectively) when each condition was compared to fasted state exposure. The decrease in the 
bioavailability of odevixibat following administration with food, did not correlate with differences in 
changes from baseline in the concentration of the PD marker, C4. Taking into account the lack of 
PK/PD relationship and need for sprinkling the odevixibat capsule contents on food for younger 
children, it is agreed to recommend that odevixibat can be administered with food. 
Distribution 
The odevixibat plasma protein binding was high, >99.7% at 4 μM and >99.97% at 40 μM (unbound 
fraction <0.3%). In different studies, different V/F values were reported. V/F varied between 614 L

(paediatric target population, based on population modelling) and 9940 L (adult subjects’ study A4250-
013; reported in the SmPC). The Applicant has presented descriptive statistics on V/F and body weight 
adjusted V/F derived with the population PK analysis for the odevixibat PK studies (A4250-001,-003, -
004, -005, and -013). The results of the body weight adjusted V/F are consistent between studies. 
Based on these data the following statement, agreed by the CHMP, was included in the SmPC: The 
mean body weight adjusted apparent volumes of distribution (V/F) in paediatric patients for the 40 and 
120 µg/kg/day dose regimens are 40.3 and 43.7 L/kg, respectively. 
Elimination 
Based on population PK modelling, the mean half-life in paediatric patients was about 2.4 hours. The 
half-life is highly variable and could often not be determined using the non-compartmental data, due 
many undetectable samples in the terminal elimination phase. In different studies, different CL/F 
values were reported, probably due to differences in body weight. CL/F varied between 398 L/hr 
(paediatric target population, based on population modelling) and 3060 L/hr (adult subjects’ study 
A4250-013; reported in the SmPC). The Applicant has presented descriptive statistics on Cl/F and body 
weight adjusted Cl/F derived with the population PK analysis for the odevixibat PK studies (A4250-
001,-003, -004, -005, and -013). The results of the body weight adjusted Cl/F are consistent between 
studies. Section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
The elimination pathways odevixibat were evaluated in mass balance study A4250-007. About 83% of 
the administered oral dose was recovered in 216 hours. An average of 0.002% (0 to 0.1%) of the total 
radioactivity was recovered from the urine and 82.886% (75.39 to 90.76%) was recovered from the 
faeces. Metabolic profiling data of the faecal samples obtained in mass balance study A4250-007 show 
that odevixibat is minimally metabolised in humans. In faeces >96% of the radioactivity was identified 
as the parent compound, suggesting minimal metabolism of odevixibat. In vitro study ALB-005 with 
human hepatocytes identified three minor metabolites: M2, M3 and M6.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Due to the low and variable absorption it is not possible to estimate the dose proportionality 
(Cmax/dose and AUC/dose) accurately. However, the mean Cmax and AUC0-t tended to increase with 
increasing doses. No accumulation of odevixibat is observed after multiple-dose administration, due to 
the short elimination half-life of the drug.  
Special populations 
Many PFIC patients have some degree of hepatic impairment because of the nature of the disease. 
Hepatic metabolism of odevixibat is not a major component of the elimination of odevixibat. Analysis of 
data from a placebo-controlled study in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 did not demonstrate a 
clinically important impact of mildly impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh A) on the pharmacokinetics 
of odevixibat. Although, body weight adjusted CL/F values were lower and body weight adjusted V/F 
values were larger in paediatric patients with PFIC with Child Pugh B compared to healthy subjects, the 
safety profile was comparable between the patient groups. Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh C) have not been studied. 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of odevixibat were observed based on mild 
renal impairment, age, sex or race. No subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment were 
included in the studies.

EMA/319560/2021  
Page 65/182 
 
 
 
Further, the applicant used the population model to simulate the pharmacokinetics in paediatric 
patients < 1 year-old. Simulations predict that the Cmax values in paediatric patients will remain below 
1.06 ng/mL in most paediatric patients< 1 year old. As no PK samples are available for these infants, it 
is not possible to evaluate the appropriateness of the model, in children <1year. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The role of different transporters and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes on the fate of odevixibat was 
explored in vitro. Odevixibat concentrations in the range of 0.01-30 μM have been tested. Odevixibat 
has a very low bioavailability and is minimally metabolised. Therefore, the risk of metabolic 
interactions is minimal. In vitro tests showed that odevixibat was a substrate for the gastrointestinal 
efflux transporter P-gp and suggest that odevixibat could potentially inhibit CYP3A4 in the gut.  
Based on the in vitro tests, odevixibat was not anticipated to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 
nor an inhibitor of CYP1A2 or 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, 2C8, at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Further, the in vitro tests showed that odevixibat is not a substrate for the transporter BCRP and it was 
not anticipated to inhibit any of the transporters tested (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 
and OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K. 
Study A4250-013 was conducted to investigate drug interactions with itraconazole, an inhibitor of P-
gp and midazolam, a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4. This study showed a 50-60% increase of 
odevixibat exposure upon concomitant coadministration with the P-gp inhibitor itraconazole. 
Concomitant administration with the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam resulted not in an increase, but 
instead in a 30% decrease of midazolam exposure and a 20% decrease of its 1-OH-midazolam 
metabolite. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics (PD) of odevixibat were evaluated in Studies A4250-001 and A4250-003 by 
assessment of changes from baseline in serum bile acids, faecal bile acids, fibroblast growth factor 19 
(FGF19), 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and autotaxin levels. A reduction in bile acid absorption 
is expected to result in lower levels of FGF19 and higher levels of C4. Autotaxin levels have been 
correlated with cholestatic pruritus. 
Mechanism of action 
Odevixibat is a small molecule that acts as a potent, selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter 
(IBAT). IBAT is a key regulator of the bile acid pool and a key element in enterohepatic circulation 
(Dawson 2003). 
Odevixibat, administered orally, acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to IBAT to decrease the 
reuptake of bile acids into the liver, increasing the clearance of bile acids through the colon and 
lowering hepatic bile acid load and serum bile acids. By inhibiting the IBAT with high selectivity and 
potency, odevixibat has the potential to reduce the systemic accumulation of bile acids that result from 
cholestasis, relieve pruritus, improve liver function, and modify the progression of liver damage in 
patients with PFIC without surgical intervention.

Part 1 – single ascending dose 
Mean decreases in FGF19 and mean increases in C4 from pre-dose to both post-dose time points 
(4 hours and 24 hours) were generally observed for each odevixibat dose level (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 
10 mg) compared with placebo but with high inter-subject variability. No meaningful dose-related 
trend was observed. 
Overall and for each odevixibat dose level, mean decreases in plasma total bile acids from Day 1 pre-
dose were recorded at 4 and at 24 hours post-dose, but with high inter-subject variability. No 
differences could be seen between dose levels. 
Part 2 – multiple ascending dose 
Cohorts 1 to 3 (Odevixibat 1 mg QD, 3 mg QD, and 1.5 mg BID Versus Placebo) 
For FGF19, mean decreases from Day 1 pre-dose were observed for all odevixibat dose levels at all 
post-dose time points on Days 1 and 7, and at pre-dose on Day 7. For C4, comparable mean increases 
from Day 1 pre-dose were observed for all odevixibat dose levels at all post-dose time points on Days 
1 and 7, with greater mean increases observed on Day 7. Pairwise treatment comparisons with placebo 
showed the adjusted arithmetic means were statistically significant for 3 mg odevixibat (FGF19 and C4 
on both study days) and for 1.5 mg odevixibat BID (FGF19 on both study days and C4 on Day 7). 
Mean decreases from Day 1 pre-dose in plasma levels of total bile acids were observed for odevixibat-
dosed subjects in all cohorts, but with a high degree of variability. Pairwise treatment comparisons 
with placebo showed the mean decreases were statistically significant for 3 mg odevixibat QD and 
1.5 mg odevixibat BID at isolated time points and were of similar magnitude.  
Increases in mean changes from Day 1 pre-dose in concentrations of total bile acids in faecal 
homogenate and increases in the amount excreted over 24 hours post-dose during Day 7, were 
recorded for both placebo and odevixibat (at all dose levels), but with high variability. However, 
greater mean increases were observed for odevixibat-dosed subjects than for placebo-dosed subjects. 
Cohorts 2, and 4 to 7 (Odevixibat/Cholestyramine versus Odevixibat Alone and Placebo) 
There was a sustained decrease in FGF19 and an increase in C4 levels compared to baseline following 
repeat dosing of odevixibat alone (Cohort 2) or in combination with either Questran (Cohort 4) or CRC 
(Cohorts 5 and 7). Co-administration of odevixibat 3 mg QD with Questran appeared to result in a 
greater decrease in FGF19 mean AUC0–12 and in a greater increase in C4 mean AUC0–12 compared to 
administration of 3 mg odevixibat alone. 
The odevixibat/Questran and odevixibat/CRC combinations did not appear to have had an additive 
effect on AUC(0–12) estimates of plasma total bile acids, irrespective of the timing of CRC 
administration concerning odevixibat dosing. 
Mean increases from Day 1 pre-dose in the concentration and amount of total bile acids in faecal 
homogenate to Day 7 post-dose (24-hour collection period) were recorded for both 
odevixibat/Questran and odevixibat/CRC combinations, and placebo dose groups, but with high 
variability. 
Study A4250-003 (paediatric patients with cholestatic pruritus) 
A reduction in serum bile acid levels was observed after 4 weeks of daily treatment with odevixibat in 
all dose groups, with the smallest mean reduction being 30.9% in the 0.01 mg/kg dose group and the 
largest being 62.8% in the 0.06 mg/kg dose group. Further dose escalation did not show any 
additional decrease in total serum bile acids. Figure 5 illustrates the changes observed by cohort.

Figure 5: Total Serum Bile Acids (μmol/L)—Mean Values by Dose Group and Study Period 
(Full Analysis Set). 
Individual patient responses varied from a 98% reduction of total serum bile acids in some patients to 
almost unchanged levels in others. Numerically, patients with PFIC trended toward a greater response 
than patients with other diagnoses. The best response in the subgroup of patients with PFIC was at 30 
μg/kg/day. 
Mean increases from baseline to end of treatment in C4 were observed in all dose groups. Mean 
decreases in FGF19 were seen in all dose groups except the 0.1 mg/kg dose group. Mean decreases in 
plasma autotaxin were observed in all dose groups. No obvious dose-dependency for C4, FGF19, and 
autotaxin was seen (Table ).

Secondary pharmacology 
A dedicated QT study was not conducted. Non-clinical data indicated a low potential for adverse effects 
on the cardiovascular system, including cardiac conduction as assessed by ECG. This was supported by 
the ECG findings performed in Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy volunteers. 
Odevixibat did not affect the hERG potassium channel at the tested concentration (1 μM), which is 
7700-fold higher than the IC50 (0.13 nM) in the human IBAT transfected cell assay (0062SZ). 
The clinical data in conjunction with the minimal systemic exposure to odevixibat, resulting only in 
transient nanomolar plasma concentrations (where quantifiable), indicates odevixibat does not carry a 
significant risk for induction of arrhythmias or QTc prolongation. 
Dose-response analysis 
Dose-response relationships were explored based on nonclinical results and biomarkers (bile acids, 
FGF19, and C4) in healthy subjects and children with cholestatic pruritus to support dosing of 
odevixibat. 
Dose-Response Analysis of Odevixibat in Nonclinical Study

odevixibat were 0.00439, 0.0395 and 0.0834 mg/kg, respectively. Dose levels in study A4250-003 
provided an adequate coverage of dose levels relative to above parameters, with the lowest dose 
(Cohort 1, 0.01 mg/kg) approximately 2-fold higher than the ED50 and the highest dose (Cohort 6, 0.2 
mg/kg) approximately 2-fold higher than the ED95.

Among the different models tested, an Emax model was associated with a better fit of the AUC0-12 for 
bile acids vs dose. A gradual dose-dependent reduction in the AUC0-12 of bile acids was observed on 
Day 7 (

The model-estimated ED50 was 0.0123 mg/kg but was associated with a high uncertainty. The 
corresponding ED90 and ED95 are 0.111 and 0.234 mg/kg, respectively. Dose levels in study A4250-
003 provided an adequate coverage of dose levels relative to these parameters.

An Emax model best fit the data. A very steep dose-response relationship was observed on Day 7 
(Figure 7). The estimated ED50 was very low (0.000649 mg/kg), suggesting a plateau of effect at 
doses greater than 0.01 mg/kg.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methodology: Although an appropriately validated and sufficiently sensitive bioanalytical method was 
used to analyse the concentration of odevixibat in plasma, about 50% of the study samples were 
undetectable, and no ISR was conducted in studies A4250-001, A4250-005 and A4250-007 due to the 
small number of quantifiable results for odevixibat; which is considered acceptable. The non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters could not be determined for all subjects because the 
plasma levels of odevixibat were often not quantifiable in the terminal elimination phase. As the 
population PK analysis developed by the applicant accounted for the samples BLQ, the population 
model is considered more appropriate for assessing the PK of odevixibat than the non-compartmental 
studies. The population PK model accounted for the samples BLQ, using the likelihood method M3, as 
published by Beal. Data excluded from the primary analysis was detailed and sensitivity analyses 
confirmed that the exclusion of these data did not impact the results. The methodology used to 
construct the data set is considered acceptable, and PK model appears to describe the observed data 
reasonably well. The PK of odevixibat was described using a one-compartment model with linear 
elimination and two different rate constants of absorption (Ka1 and Ka2, with their respective lag 
times) to characterize double peak profiles. The base model included fixed exponents for the effect of 
body weight on CL/F and V/F (0.75 and 1, respectively), which is supported. PK parameters were 
estimated with good precision, and shrinkage values were adequate.  
Covariates included in the final model, in addition to bodyweight on CL/F and V/F, were P-gp inhibitors 
and liver impairment on CL/F, dosage form and formulation on relative bioavailability, and formulation 
on Ka1. The rationale for covariate selection was adequately justified. The inclusion of covariates in the 
final model resulted in a decrease in between-subject variability (BSV) for CL/F and Ka1 but an 
increase in BSV for V/F. However, V/F was only dependent on body weight.  
In order to allow assessment of the precision of parameter estimates, the applicant provided %RSE 
values for all parameters in the final model. Most parameters were estimated with good precision. A 
notable exception is the high RSE of 95.6% for the covariate effect FrelFORMABC21 (to describe the 
different bioavailability of early formulation A, which was only used in SD/MD dose-finding study 
A4250-001). Nonparametric bootstrap resampling analysis showed comparable estimates to those 
derived in the original analysis. However, the 95% CI for the effect of formulation on Frel includes 
zero. The applicant explained that the reason for including the covariate effect of formulation was that 
it was highly statistically significant in the formal covariate analysis. Further, in the small number of 
subjects administered early formulation A, odevixibat concentrations were markedly lower than with 
other formulations. Given the small number of Formulation A concentrations in the popPK analysis, the 
95% CI from the bootstrap analysis was considerably wide and should be interpreted with caution. It 
may have been more appropriate to fix this parameter to a plausible value or remove it from the 
model, but the issue was not further pursued. 
VPCs of the final model suggest that the predictive ability of the model is limited. In the overall 
population, there is a tendency for underprediction of median peak concentrations and variability is not 
well captured. VPCs stratified by study show reasonably poor prediction of paediatric data in study 
A4250-003, with clear over-prediction of median concentrations. This is further seen in the VPCs by 
disease type, since all patients included in the dataset were paediatric. Finally, VPCs stratified by 
degree of liver impairment indicate poor model prediction in patients with liver impairment. Although 
the predictive ability of the model is limited, it is questionable whether the model can be improved 
without additional collection of PK samples. As limited PK data are currently available in children and 
concentrations were very low and often undetectable, the poor predictions are accepted.

Several bioanalytical methods were developed to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of odevixibat. 
For each method validation report submitted, data were presented to confirm calibration curve (CC) 
performance, intra- and inter-assay accuracy and precision using quality control (QC) samples. 
However, not all methods have been fully validated; some were qualified or partially validated. Upon 
request from the CHMP, the applicant provided detailed performance characteristics of the total bile 
acid assay, which shows that intra- and inter- assay reproducibility were within the accepted range. 
Further, routine technology has been used to determine liver function tests, which is considered 
acceptable. 
Updated stability data were submitted. Long-term stability of C4 in human plasma has been shown for 
388 days at -20°C and 380 days at -80°C (project LGC301045QB40); study samples of studies A4250-
004 and -005 have been analysed within the validated stability period. However, it should be noted 
that the stability of C4 in human plasma under this analytic project was assessed with acceptance 
criteria of < + 30% CV and RE; EMA guideline on method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 
Rev. 1 Corr. 2**), states that the mean concentration of QC samples should be within ±15% of the 
nominal concentration. Further, LPA samples from study A4250-005 were analysed outside of the 552-
day stability period. Both samples are presented in the report for information only and were analysed 
initially within the stability period but gave concentrations above the analytic range. It is acceptable 
that repeat analysis of 2 samples was conducted outside the stability window. 
In method QBR116156QB02 for determination of bile acids in human plasma or faeces, all QC samples 
and calibration standards were prepared in a surrogate matrix (phosphate buffered saline), because 
the analytes are endogenous in both human plasma and faeces. Precision and accuracy of the method 
was determined using this surrogate matrix, these data demonstrate that the %CV and %RE for each 
analyte calibration curve, were within <20%, the acceptance criterion for precision and accuracy of the 
method. It is accepted that samples from study A4250-001, were measured using a non-validated 
assay and was not used for analysis of samples from other studies.  
No ISR was performed for determination of FGF-19 (study A4250-001) and determination of LPA 
(studies A4250-003, A4250-005), but the applicant has provided adequate reasoning for the failure to 
perform incurred sample reanalysis (ISR).  
Absorption: Odevixibat is a low permeability drug designed for minimal systemic absorption and 
intended to act locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) to 
decrease the reuptake of bile acids from the ileum and their return to the liver. The low solubility and 
low permeability have been appropriately demonstrated in vitro.  
A low bioavailability was observed in the submitted single and multiple-dose studies A4250-001 and 
A4250-003. In mass balance study A4250-007 about 83% of the administered oral dose was 
recovered in 216 hours. An average of 0.002% of the total radioactivity was recovered from the urine, 
and 82.886% was recovered from the faeces. In about 50% of the study samples, odevixibat was 
undetectable. These data indicate that there is very limited absorption of odevixibat following oral 
administration. In the SmPC, the pharmacokinetic results from study A4250-013 are presented. In 
this study, healthy adults received a single oral dose of 7200 µg odevixibat, the highest recommended 
dose of odevixibat. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided an estimate of the relative 
bioavailability in humans, which is < 1% based on pop PK data on study A4250-005 and non-
compartmental data of study A4250-013. The exposure of odevixibat was calculated for the 40 and 
120 μg/kg/day dose levels in the target population, paediatric patients with PFIC (study A4250-005), 
using the population model. The mean Cmax of odevixibat in paediatric patients treated with the 40 and 
120 μg/kg/day dose were 0.211 and 0.623 ng/mL, respectively, and their mean AUCs were 2.26 and 
5.99 ng*hr/mL, respectively. However, differences were observed between observed and simulated 
post hoc patient data of study A4250-005. The applicant clarified the differences, between observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 78/182 
 
 
 
and simulated post hoc patient data of study A4250-005. For many study subjects no measurable 
concentrations could be reported due to sparse sampling and the lack of samples around Cmax. The pop 
PK model includes rich concentration time profiles and can be used to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
odevixibat more accurately. The model-based concentration time data for the paediatric PFIC 
population, are mentioned in the updated SmPC, this is considered acceptable.  
Food effect study A4250-004 showed that concomitant administration of a high-fat resulted in 
decreases of approximately 72% and 62% in Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively, compared to 
administration under fasted conditions. When odevixibat was sprinkled on apple sauce, decreases of 
approximately 39% and 36% in Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively, were observed compared to 
administration under fasted conditions However, this effect on the pharmacokinetics did not correlate 
with differences in changes from baseline in the concentration of the PD marker C4. Taking into 
account the lack of PK/PD relationship and need for sprinkling the odevixibat capsule contents on food 
for younger children, it is agreed by the CHMP to recommend that odevixibat can be administered with 
food. As no safety markers were studied and the drug is intended to act locally in the GI tract, a higher 
bioavailability is not desired; therefore, the current advice to take the drug with food is supported by 
the CHMP. 
Distribution: The volume of distribution differed between the dense sampling study A4250-013 and 
the population PK study. In study A4250-013 , the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 9940 
L, following a single oral dose of 7200 µg odevixibat in healthy adults. This differs from the V/F 
reported in the population PK model, a V/F of 2510 L and 614 L were reported for the overall 
population and paediatric population, respectively. These differences can be explained by the use of 
different calculation methods and body weight differences. As V/F is body weight dependent, the 
applicant presents the body weight normalised volume of distribution in the SmPC, which is acceptable 
to the CHMP.  
Elimination: The consistency of the half-life and clearance (CLss/F) across studies is difficult to assess 
based on non-compartmental data, due to many undetectable samples in the terminal elimination 
phase. As the population model did account for the samples below the detection limit, it is preferred to 
present the model estimates in the SmPC.  
The clearance differed between the dense sampling study A4250-013 and the population PK study. In 
study A4250-013, the average apparent total clearance (CLss/F) was 3060 L/h and a mean half-life 
(t1/2) 2.36 hours. This value differs from CL/F reported in the population PK model, CL/F of 2180 L/h 
and 398 L/h were reported for the overall population and paediatric population, respectively. These 
differences can be explained by the use of different calculation methods and body weight differences. 
As CL/F is body weight dependent the applicant presents the body weight normalised clearance in the 
SmPC, which is acceptable to the CHMP.  
Variability and dose proportionality: Due to the low bioavailability of odevixibat, the variability of the 
PK parameters is relatively high. It is not possible to estimate the dose proportionality (Cmax/dose and 
AUC/dose) accurately. However, the mean Cmax and AUC0-t tended to increase with increasing doses. 
Odevixibat has a short elimination half-life, and no accumulation is observed. The agreed SmPC 
mentions that the Cmax and AUC0-t increase with increasing doses in a dose-proportional manner; 
however due to the high between-subject-subject variability of approximately 40%, it is not possible to 
estimate the dose proportionality accurately. 
Transport: Odevixibat is identified as a substrate of P-gp and P-gp transporters are encoded by the 
MDR1 gene which is known to have allelic variants that have been shown to influence protein 
expression and P-glycoprotein. It is possible that genetic polymorphism may contribute to the 
variability of absorption. As the bioavailability is low in all subjects and the drug interaction study with 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 79/182 
 
 
 
itraconazole has shown that the impact on P-gp inhibition is small, the CHMP agrees that there is no 
need to investigate the role of polymorphism of MBR1. 
Special populations: The population PK analysis was used to evaluate the influence of intrinsic factors 
on the pharmacokinetics of odevixibat. Weight and hepatic impairment were identified as relevant 
covariates. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of odevixibat were observed 
based on age, sex or race. 
Limited systemic PK data are available in order to compare subjects with hepatic dysfunction to 
subjects with normal hepatic function as none of the paediatric subjects, included in the Phase 3 study 
A4250-005 had a normal hepatic function. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant presented a 
comparison of the PK results of the Phase 3 study A4250-005 and data from studies A4250-004 and 
A4250-013 in healthy adult subjects with normal liver function, to assess the impact of hepatic 
impairment. The body weight adjusted pharmacokinetic parameters of odevixibat were comparable 
between paediatric patients with PFIC with Child Pugh A and healthy subjects. Body weight adjusted 
CL/F values were lower and body weight adjusted V/F values were larger in paediatric patients with 
PFIC with Child Pugh B compared to healthy subjects. The mean body weight adjusted CL/F and V/F 
values were 10 L/h/kg and 51 L/kg in subjects with moderate hepatic dysfunction and 34 L/h/kg and 
34 L/kg in subjects with normal hepatic function, respectively. According to the applicant, model 
predicted parameters for Child-Pugh B may have been skewed by two individual patients with Child 
Pugh B with unexpectedly high concentrations. It is agreed that, due to the limited number of 
measurable samples, this may have impacted the PK model. Although no clinically relevant tolerability 
differences have been observed between paediatric subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 
healthy adults, it remains difficult to interpret the PK model correctly due to the limited amount of data 
which may be skewed for unknown reasons.  
Mild renal impairment does not have any significant effect on the PK of odevixibat. This is consistent 
with the minimal renal elimination of odevixibat observed in mass balance study A4250-007, 0.002% 
of the total radioactivity was recovered from the urine. The applicant confirmed that there are no data 
in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or ESRD and has updated the SmPC to reflect 
this. Given the minimal absorption and minimal renal elimination of odevixibat, no dosage adjustment 
is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and no additional monitoring is 
warranted.  
The pivotal Phase 3 study (A4250-005) included paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months) with a body 
weight above 5 kg. However, Section 4.2 of the SmPC specifies doses for patients with a 4 kg or higher 
body weight. The applicant explained that, based on the dosing schedule in the SmPC, a child weighing 
4 kg would receive doses that are within the dose ranges allowed in higher weight bands and have 
demonstrated both safety and efficacy. Further, inclusion of the lower of weight of 4 kg in the SmPC 
would allow symptomatic children weighing 4 kg to receive treatment. The SmPC is considered 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
The population model was used to simulate the pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients < 1 year old. 
Simulations predict that the Cmax values in paediatric patients will remain below 1.06 ng/mL in most 
paediatric patients< 1 year old. As no PK samples are available for these infants it is not possible to 
check the goodness of fit of the model in children <1year. The applicant proposes to indicate 
odevixibat for the use in children aged 6 months and older with PFIC, based on clinical efficacy and 
safety data. The use of PK modelling simulations in the youngest age group, without the goodness of 
fit data in this age group, is considered acceptable as the bioavailability of odevixibat is very low, and 
collection of PK samples is difficult in this age group. The extrapolation approach for paediatric patients 
aged <1 year assumes similar exposure-response relationships for safety between patients <1 year of 
age and children (1-17 years of age). An assessment based on clinical efficacy and safety data is 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 80/182 
 
 
 
appropriate for this age group. However, simulations indicated that, at a dose of 120 µg/kg/day, 0.9% 
and 9.0% of paediatric patients (aged 6 to <12 months) with mild and moderate liver impairment, 
respectively, would be expected to achieve Cmax values above 1.06 ng/mL , the level demonstrated to 
have an acceptable safety profile in clinical studies. The applicant considers that these proportions are 
very low and, therefore, a dose adjustment for paediatric patients <1 year is not warranted. The 
applicant further justified that, based on simulations, the 120 µg/kg/day dosing regimen of odevixibat 
is expected to result in Cmax values below 2 ng/mL patients with PFIC < 1 year of age, which is about 
3-fold lower than the NOAEL for dogs. 
Interactions: The role of different transporters and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes on the fate of 
odevixibat was explored in vitro. Odevixibat concentrations have been tested in the clinically relevant 
concentration range of 0.01-30 μM. Odevixibat has a very low bioavailability and is minimally 
metabolised. Therefore, the risk of metabolic interactions is minimal. In vitro tests showed that 
odevixibat was a substrate for the gastrointestinal efflux transporter P-gp and suggested that 
odevixibat could potentially inhibit CYP3A4 in the gut. Concomitant administration with the P-gp 
inhibitor itraconazole resulted in a 50-60% increase of odevixibat exposure. These results are 
consistent with odevixibat being a substrate of P-gp. However, the magnitude of the increase indicates 
that this interaction is not clinically relevant. Concomitant administration with the CYP3A4 substrate 
midazolam resulted in a 30% decrease of midazolam exposure and a 20% decrease of its 1-OH-
midazolam metabolite. Because the impact was small and did not follow the classical pattern for 
inhibition of CYP3A4, the interaction at the gut level is not considered clinically important.  
Because treatment with odevixibat results in decreased recirculation of bile acids also the absorption of 
fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and lipophilic drugs may be affected. Therefore, the applicant 
monitored the vitamin status as a safety parameter in the clinical studies. In the agreed SmPC section 
4.5, the results of the monitoring of fat-soluble vitamins have been provided and it is mentioned that 
the potential interaction with lipophilic drugs has not been investigated. This wording is agreed by the 
CHMP. Levels of fat-soluble vitamins will be monitored in a post-marketing setting. 
The non-clinical studies indicate that odevixibat may be teratogenic at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, adequate contraception is required. However, no interaction study with oral 
hormonal contraception has been conducted. The applicant committed to conduct an interaction study 
with an oral hormonal contraceptive. The final study report is awaited in agreed due time. In the 
agreed SmPC section 4.5, it is mentioned that the potential interaction with oral contraceptives has not 
been investigated. Since the uptake of lipophilic oral contraceptives may be affected by odevixibat, a 
barrier contraceptive method should be used. 
Pharmacodynamics  
The PD of odevixibat were evaluated by assessment of changes from baseline in serum bile acids, 
faecal bile acids, FGF19, C4 and autotaxin levels (which have been correlated with cholestatic 
pruritus).  
Primary pharmacology 
Study A4250-001 (healthy adults): In Part 1 of the study, following a single dose of odevixibat to 
healthy subjects, greater mean decreases in plasma FGF19 and associated increases in plasma C4 
levels were generally observed at all dose levels compared with placebo. However, there was no 
apparent dose-related trend for these changes. Mean plasma total bile acids levels increased post-dose 
at all levels, although a high degree of variability was observed. This trend towards a general increase 
in total bile acids is not consistent with the mode of action of odevixibat. The applicant considers that 
this could be due to the insufficient duration of effect of odevixibat with a single dose. In Part 2 of the 
study, following repeated administration of odevixibat for 7 days to healthy subjects, mean decreases 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 81/182 
 
 
 
in FGF19 were observed for all dose levels with a corresponding increase in C4 plasma levels. These 
changes were most notable for the 3 mg once daily dose level.  
Mean decreases in plasma total bile acids were observed at all dose levels, but not consistently. 
Compared with placebo, significantly greater mean changes in total bile acids on Day 7 were shown for 
the 3 mg once daily and 1.5 mg twice daily regimens but only at 24 h post-dose and pre-dose time 
points, respectively. Notably, odevixibat/cholestyramine combinations, no statistically significant 
results were recorded for any odevixibat dose level when Day 7 and Day 1 mean changes in total bile 
acids were compared. Overall, the data suggest that the effect of odevixibat on plasma total bile acids 
is highly variable. 
For mean changes in concentrations of total bile acids in faecal homogenate and the amount excreted 
at 24 h post-dose during Day 7, mean increases from baseline were recorded for placebo and all 
odevixibat dose levels, but with high variability. Greater mean increases were observed for active-
dosed subjects than for placebo-dosed subjects. Pairwise treatment comparisons with placebo showed 
that the adjusted arithmetic means (mean increases) were statistically significantly greater for 3 mg 
once daily and 1.5 mg twice daily but not for 1 mg once daily. 
Results of the exploratory analysis in Part 2 of the study suggested that Questran, but not CRC, may 
have an additive effect on odevixibat in terms of FGF19 and C4 levels. The odevixibat/Questran and 
odevixibat/CRC combinations did not appear to have an additive effect on AUC(0–12) estimates of 
plasma total bile acids, irrespective of the timing of CRC administration concerning odevixibat dosing. 
Study A4250-003 (paediatric patients with cholestatic pruritus): Reduction in total serum bile acids 
was highly variable. There was a trend for greater mean decreases with increasing doses up to 60 
µg/kg/day. No further reductions were apparent at doses above this. The best response in the 
subgroup of patients with PFIC was at 30 μg/kg/day. 
For the biochemical markers of bile synthesis, mean decreases in FGF19, mean increases in C4 and 
mean decreases in plasma autotaxin were observed, with no apparent dose-dependency. These PD 
trends are generally consistent with those observed in healthy adults in Study A4250-001.  
Dose-Response Analysis of Odevixibat by weight (study A4250-003 and -005): It is agreed with the 
applicant that this may be due to a plateau already reached. In the analysis no dose relationship could 
be established, these results are in line with clinical observations, which support similar efficacy 
between the 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day two dose regimen. The lack of clear dose-response 
relationship is mentioned in SmPC section 5.2.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Lack of a dedicated QT study is considered acceptable. Non-clinical data indicated a low potential for 
QT prolongation with odevixibat at the very low systemic exposure observed in the clinical studies at 
the proposed dose.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
It is considered possible that odevixibat reduces the levels of conjugated UDCA in patients with PFIC 
while parent UDCA levels may be elevated. Nevertheless, in Study A4250-005, the majority of 
patients were on stable doses of UDCA and the beneficial effects of odevixibat were not compromised. 
UDCA and odevixibat can be administered concomitantly. 
Genetic differences in PD response to odevixibat 
Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant discussed the potential for genetic differences in the PD 
response to odevixibat. There are no known genetic mutations that result in changes to IBAT that 
produce resistance to inhibition by odevixibat. In addition, genetic variations in the CYP enzymes or 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 82/182 
 
 
 
transporters are unlikely to impact the PD response to odevixibat since it undergoes minimal 
metabolism and inhibition of the P-gp transporter did not result in relevant increase of the odevixibat 
exposure (see transporters).  
Dose-response analysis 
The objective of this modelling exercise was to explore dose-response relationships based on non-
clinical results and biomarkers (bile acids, C4, and FGF19) in healthy subjects as well as children with 
cholestatic pruritus to support dosing of odevixibat. 
While bile acids, C4 and FGF19 presented dose-dependent relationships in healthy subjects following 7 
days of dosing (Study A4250-001), a treatment effect independent of the dose was observed 
following 42 days of dosing in children with cholestatic pruritus (Study A4250-003). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Odevixibat is a low permeability drug designed for minimal systemic absorption and intended to act 
locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids from the 
ileum and their return to the liver. It has been appropriately shown that odevixibat has low 
bioavailability and generally, the pharmacokinetics of odevixibat has been sufficiently characterised. As 
non-clinical studies indicate that odevixibat might be teratogenic at clinically relevant concentrations, 
the applicant has agreed to conduct an interaction study with oral hormonal contraception following the 
CHMP’s request.  
Based on the data submitted, the inclusion of appropriate information in the SmPC, especially on 
impact of hepatic impairment, the extrapolation to children <1 year and the between-study 
consistency of the pharmacokinetic data, the pharmacodynamic properties of odevixibat are considered 
demonstrated.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Drug-drug Interaction study to investigate the interactions between odevixibat and oral 
contraceptives, due to observations in non-clinical studies that odevixibat might be teratogenic 
at clinically relevant concentrations.

Study A4250-003 was a Phase 2 single and multiple-dose, dose-finding, open-label study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of odevixibat when administered for 4 weeks in paediatric patients diagnosed 
with cholestatic pruritus (including patients with PFIC, Alagille syndrome, biliary atresia, and sclerosing 
cholangitis). 
Methods 
The study included a screening period to determine eligibility (this period also included a 7-day 
washout for patients on prior bile acid resin or other prohibited medication), single administration 
treatment period with a 10-day follow-up period, and a 4-week treatment period. There was no 
randomisation or stratification in the study.  
Study Participants 
Inclusion Criteria 
For inclusion in the study, patients had to fulfil the following criteria: 
•  Diagnosis of pruritus due to chronic cholestasis based on history and Investigator judgment 
• 
• 
• 
This included but was not restricted to patients with PFIC, ALGS, BA, and sclerosing cholangitis 
Laboratory markers of cholestasis identified within 3 months before Visit 1 
Total serum bile acids at least 2 times above the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
•  A VAS-itch of at least 3 (average of 7 days) on a 0-10 grade VAS at Visit 2 
Exclusion Criteria 
•  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator constituted a risk for the patient or a 
contraindication for participation and completion of the study, or could interfere with study 
objectives, conduct, or evaluations 
•  Clinical or biochemical signs of decompensated liver disease (such as ascites)  
• 
Liver transplantation 
•  Structural abnormality of the GI tract (biliary diversion procedures accepted) 
•  Known, active, clinically significant acute or chronic infection, or any major episode of infection 
requiring hospitalization or treatment with parenteral anti-infective treatment within 4 weeks of 
treatment start (Study Day 1) or completion of oral anti-infective treatment within 2 weeks 
prior to start of the Screening period 
Treatments 
The study was designed to have 6 dose cohorts with 4 patients to be evaluated in each cohort. Patients 
were permitted to re-enrol into a later cohort after completion and a washout period following 
treatment in their first cohort. 
•  Cohort 1: 0.01 mg/kg/day 
•  Cohort 2: 0.03 mg/kg/day 
•  Cohort 3: 0.06 mg/kg/day 
•  Cohort 4: 0.1 mg/kg/day 
•  Cohort 5: 0.2 mg/kg/day 
•  Cohort 6: 0.3 mg/kg/day (planned) 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021

The study was originally designed to evaluate doses up to 300 µg/kg/day. However, two patients with 
Alagille syndrome in the 200 µg/kg/day cohort experienced elevations in LFTs >2 times baseline. 
Although the respective investigators deemed both cases to be unrelated to study treatment and in 
line with their historical LFT fluctuations, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended 
that further dose escalation not occur as elevations in one of the patients were considered inconclusive 
by the DSMB. Continued dosing at the 200 µg/kg/day was allowed.  
In the situation that despite odevixibat treatment, the patient deteriorated biliary diversion surgery or 
liver transplant could be engaged as a rescue treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this Phase 2 exploratory study in patients treated with odevixibat due to 
cholestasis induced pruritus were as follows: 
•  Assess the safety and tolerability of odevixibat orally administered first as a single dose and 
then during a 4-week treatment period as determined by the occurrence of treatment-
emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) 
• 
Explore changes in total serum bile acids during a 4-week treatment period 
Secondary safety objectives of this study included assessment of the safety and tolerability of 
odevixibat first as a single administration and then during a 4-week treatment period, as determined 
by the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in safety parameters 
including laboratory tests and vital signs. 
Secondary efficacy objectives of this study were as follows: 
•  Demonstrate the efficacy of odevixibat, orally administered during a 4-week treatment period, 
on liver biochemistry variables and on pruritus parameters 
• 
• 
Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of A4250 orally administered first as a single 
dose and then after a 4-week treatment period 
Evaluate changes in visual analogue scale (VAS)-itch score after a 4-week treatment period 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy of treatment was assessed by measuring of serum bile acids levels, pruritus and 
sleep-related endpoints. Assessments of pruritus and sleep-related endpoints were based upon 
patients’ reports through a paper diary that included daily questionnaires.  
Safety assessments conducted during the study included physical examination, vital sign 
measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations (including haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), and 
review of concomitant medications and AEs. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study. There was no randomization or stratification. 
Statistical methods 
In general, descriptive statistics were presented for all efficacy variables and endpoints, PK 
parameters, and safety variables, as appropriate.

Treatments 
Patients received odevixibat at a dose of 40 μg/kg/day or 120 μg/kg/day, or placebo QD orally for 24 
weeks. Odevixibat is administered orally. Odevixibat is supplied in 2 capsule sizes and 4 strengths: 
capsule size 0 (200 or 600 μg strength) that could be opened and sprinkled on food and capsule size 3 
(400 or 1200 μg strength) to be swallowed intact but could be opened if unable to swallow the capsule. 
The specific dosing schedule can be found in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Concomitant medication 
Treatment with UDCA, rifampicin, and/or antihistamines was also allowed provided the patient was on 
a stable dosage at least 4 weeks before enrolment and no dosage changes were planned during the 
entire study period. Topical treatment was allowed without restriction. Other drugs/natural products 
with possible effects on GI motility (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibiting drugs, tetracyclic 
antidepressants, fibre supplementation, yoghurt variants) were allowed provided there was stable 
usage of the product at least 4 weeks before enrolment until treatment discontinuation. 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of repeated daily doses of 40 
μg/kg/day and 120 μg/kg/day odevixibat in children with PFIC1 and PFIC2.  
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
• To evaluate the effect of odevixibat on serum ALT concentration 
• To evaluate the effect of odevixibat on growth 
• To evaluate the effect of odevixibat on sleep disturbance 
• To evaluate the effect of odevixibat on the need for surgical treatment (biliary diversion or liver 
transplantation) 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated daily doses of odevixibat for 24 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in 
serum bile acids concentration from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 μmol/L 
(28.6 μg/mL) after 24 weeks of treatment. Serum bile acids concentration at baseline was calculated 
as the average of the last 2 values prior to the first dose. The end value was calculated as the average 
of the values at Weeks 22 and 24 after the start of treatment.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the patient level over the 24-week treatment period 
based on the Albireo ObsRO instrument. 
Additional secondary endpoints included changes from baseline to end of treatment in growth, sleep 
parameters (per ObsRO) and ALT.  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory parameters, including GIC and GIS measures, ALT, AST, GGT, autotaxin, p-C4, Albireo 
PRO and ObsRO itching/scratching severity scores, additional Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep 
parameters, PedsQL, PELD/MELD score, APRI score, and the FIB-4 score, were analysed descriptively. 
Sample size 
The study planned to enrol 60 to 70 patients in order to obtain at least 20 evaluable patients in each 
arm. For each primary endpoint, simulations with 5,000 iterations using 20 patients per arm were 
conducted to estimate the power after multiplicity adjustment, resulting in an SE of <0.7% for each 
estimated power. 
Based on the Phase 2 study (A4250-003) data, both low and high dose groups were assumed to have 
the same positive treatment effects in both the serum bile acids and pruritus endpoints in the 
simulation. For serum bile acids, binomial distributions were used to simulate the proportion of 
responders to estimate the power. The simulated proportions were analysed using the CMH test to 
generate 1-sided p-values for the following comparisons: both odevixibat arms pooled vs placebo, low 
dose vs placebo, and high dose vs placebo. Assuming 60% responders in the odevixibat arms and 10% 
responders in the placebo arm, the power to claim significance for a particular odevixibat arm after 
multiplicity adjustment was approximately 94%. The probability to claim significance for at least 1 
arm, and for both arms were approximately 99% and 91%, respectively. If the response rates were 
50% in the odevixibat arms and 10% in the placebo arm, with 20 patients per arm, the probability to 
claim significance for a particular odevixibat arm after multiplicity adjustment was approximately 82%. 
The probability to claim significance for at least 1 arm, and for both arms was approximately 91% and 
73%, respectively. 
For the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the patient level in pruritus scores, beta-
binomial distributions were used for power simulations. The effect size was 1.0526 from the original 
sample size calculation using change from baseline as the endpoint. The same effect size was assumed 
for the current endpoint for the low and high dose vs the control. A difference of 15%, 20%, 25%, and 
30% in the proportion of positive pruritus assessments was considered in power simulation. Within 
each difference, proportions of positive assessments in the placebo arm ranging from 15% to 35% 
were considered. Subsequently, the proportion of positive assessments in an active arm, the SD, and 
the corresponding beta binomial parameters were calculated to satisfy the assumed effect size. These 
parameters were used to simulate correlated binary results for each patient. The simulated proportions 
were analysed using ANCOVA to generate 1-sided p-values for the following comparisons: both 
odevixibat arms pooled vs placebo, low dose vs placebo, and high dose vs placebo. The simulation in 
each scenario was repeated for 5,000 iterations using the current sample size of 20 patients per arm. 
The simulated power to claim significance for a particular arm after multiplicity adjustment was quite 
consistent under different scenarios and was approximately 89%. The probability to claim significance 
for at least 1 arm, and for both arms was approximately 95% and 83%, respectively.

Randomisation 
Randomisation was done in block size of 6 and stratified according to PFIC type (Type 1 or 2) and age 
group (6 months to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to ≤18 years) to ensure an approximate balance 
between dose schemes (1:1:1). A separate randomisation list was prepared for the patients from 
Study A4250-003 regardless of stratification. Randomisation codes were assigned sequentially as 
patients became eligible for randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study and both investigators and patients were unaware of the treatment 
assignment during the study. 
To ensure blinding of treatment assignment, the study drug and the matching placebo had the same 
shape and size. Labels on the study drug containers did not identify the randomised treatment 
assignment. Traceability of the treatment was ensured by the study drug number that corresponded to 
the randomisation arm and was assigned by the IWRS. Additionally, in order to maintain the blind, all 
serum bile acids results during the treatment period and at follow-up were blinded; samples were 
processed at a central laboratory. 
The investigator could perform immediate unblinding through IWRS in emergency situations (i.e. 
where knowledge of the study drug was required to adequately manage a life-threatening situation). 
The investigator was to make every effort to discuss the rationale (status and outcome) for emergency 
unblinding with the medical monitor as soon as possible to review the individual patient details. 
Once the randomisation code was broken for a patient, he/she was to be withdrawn from the study 
and all assessments and procedures at EOT were to be performed. As a follow-up, Visit 10 was 
performed according to the time schedule. Once a randomisation code was broken, the investigator 
was to inform the medical monitor in writing within 24 hours. 
No emergency unblinding was conducted during the study. 
Statistical methods 
Patient populations 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
Patients were analysed as randomised. The FAS was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS): All randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 
safety analysis set was used for safety analyses. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: All patients in the FAS who did not have any important protocol 
deviations. 
Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) Test 
Statistical analysis was conducted using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by PFIC 
type and age category, to compare the 2 odevixibat dose groups to placebo. Patients with missing data 
at the end of treatment were classified as non-responders. The proportion and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI), odds ratio and corresponding 95% CI, and p-value for the CMH test are 
presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 96/182 
 
 
 
In the CMH test, data in a stratum will not be used in the calculation of the p-value if a row sum or 
column sum is 0 in the contingency table. To ensure that all data are used when this occurs, data will 
be pooled with the adjacent age stratum with a smaller number of subjects. If a row sum or column 
sum is still 0 after pooling data, all age groups will be pooled (i.e. the CMH test will be stratified by 
PFIC type only). If a row sum or column sum is still 0, the CMH test will not be stratified. Pooling 
strategy will also be conducted for a stratum with <4 patients. 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model 
The ANCOVA model is usually used to test the main and interaction effects of categorical variables on a 
continuous dependent variable, controlling for the covariates. The ANCOVA model will be used to 
analyse the comparisons of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at subject level over the 
24-week treatment period between the treatment groups. 
Multiplicity 
For EU and RoW, the primary analysis will be related to the serum bile acid responder endpoint. For 
US, the primary analysis will be related to the pruritus endpoint. For each primary endpoint, a pooled 
analysis for the closed testing procedure will be applied to control the 1-sided overall type I error rate 
for two treatment comparisons vs the placebo at the 0.025 level as specified below: 
In the closed testing procedure, the low and high dose groups are pooled to compare with the placebo 
group first. If the 1-sided p-value is ≤0.025, the 1-sided p-values for low dose vs placebo and high 
dose vs placebo, respectively will be calculated. If both individual p-values are ≤0.025, a significant 
treatment effect will be declared on both dose groups. If only one of them is ≤0.025, a significant 
treatment effect will be declared on the corresponding dose group. 
Adjusted p-values will also be reported when unadjusted p-values are presented directly from the 
model. The adjusted p-value for an individual dose is calculated as the maximum value of the 
unadjusted p-value for the pooled low and high doses and the unadjusted p-value for the individual 
doses. 
Analyses of secondary and exploratory endpoints will provide supportive efficacy and safety 
information regarding the differences between the treatment groups. No adjustments will be performed 
for multiple comparisons when testing these secondary and exploratory endpoints. 
Endpoints 
For secondary efficacy parameters, including reduction of pruritus based Albireo PRO and ObsRO for 
pruritus (see below), serum bile acids concentrations, ALT, growth, PELD/MELD, Fibroscan, APRI, FIB-
4, and Albireo PRO and ObsRO sleep parameters (see below), descriptive statistics are summarised for 
the FAS for observed values and changes from baseline for each visit. The summary of changes in 
serum bile acids, PRIand growth, are also provided based on the PP analysis set. The analysis of 
growth data is based on calculated values using the software or methods from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention website for patients with age ≥ 2 years-old and from the WHO website for 
patients < 2 years-old. Note that for determination of z-scores for the analysis of growth data, an 
accurate age (date of birth or reported age in years/months) must be recorded at baseline. 
Change in serum bile acids, ALT, and growth were analysed using a MMRM model, including terms for 
baseline, PFIC type, age category, treatment, visit, treatment-by-baseline interaction and treatment-
by-visit interaction. For serum bile acids, the MMRM analysis may be performed based on log 
transformed values if deemed appropriate. 
Liver related measurements 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 97/182 
 
 
 
Paediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) and MELD scores are used to estimate relative disease 
severity and the probability of survival for patients awaiting liver transplantation. The PELD score is 
based on the following test results: albumin, bilirubin, INR, growth [based on gender, height, and 
weight], and age at listing; this score can range across negative (e.g. from -10) and positive (e.g. 50) 
values. The MELD score is based on the following laboratory test results: serum creatinine, bilirubin, 
INR, and serum sodium and ranges from 6 (low level of illness) to 40 (gravely ill). 
Markers of fibrosis, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index for liver fibrosis 
score, were also calculated at randomisation and at the end of treatment. The APRI score is a method 
to measure fibrosis of the liver. 
Where available, Fibroscan, a specialized ultrasound of the liver measuring fibrosis and steatosis, was 
performed at randomisation and Week 24. 
Obsro and PRO instruments for pruritus and sleep disturbance 
Pruritus and sleep were measured in the study through a PRO instrument (for patients ≥8 years old) 
and an ObsRO instrument (completed by every patient’s caregiver regardless of patient age). The PRO 
asked patients about their itching during the day and night-time hours and the ObsRO asked 
caregivers about the patient’s scratching and other related behaviours observed during the daytime 
and night-time hours.  
A threshold for meaningful change was established for the ObsRO pruritus score: a change of -1.00 on 
the ObsRO score from Baseline to Week 12 and from Baseline to Week 24 can be considered 
meaningful. This threshold can be applied to individual patients in order to categorise each patient as 
having experienced meaningful change or not. A meaningful change threshold for the PRO pruritus 
score could not be calculated due to the small number of patients completing the PRO measure. 
A threshold for meaningful change was established for the ObsRO sleep disturbance domain score: a 
decrease of 0.40 (40%) reflects a substantial numeric decrease in the average percent of nights when 
patients require support due to their sleep disturbance. This threshold can be applied to individual 
patients in order to categorise each patient as having experienced meaningful change or not. 
Subgroup Efficacy Analyses 
Subgroup efficacy analyses on the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints (changes from 
baseline to each visit in serum bile acid, ALT, and growth) were performed by age group (6 months to 
5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years), by PFIC type (1 and 2), region (US, Europe and RoW), sex 
(male and female), race (Caucasian and non-Caucasian), ethnicity (Hispanic, non- Hispanic, and 
unknown), baseline serum bile acids level (≥250 and <250 μmol/L), Child-Pugh classification (A, B, C), 
BSEP type of PFIC2 patients, and the use of UDCA and rifampicin (alone or either). Subgroup analyses 
may have been conducted for hepatic impairment classification per NCI ODWG, if appropriate. 
Statistical analysis was performed only when the sample size was ≥10 in each treatment group. If the 
sample size was <10 in any treatment group, only summary statistics are provided; the p-value is not 
reported. Forest plots were also produced. Due to the anticipated small sample size in these 
subgroups, analyses by subgroups did not include the stratification factors.

Recruitment 
Date first patient enrolled: 16 May 2018; Date last patient completed: 28 July 2020 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol under which patients were first enrolled in the study was Protocol Amendment 1 
(dated 06 December 2017). There were 5 global amendments during the study. Current protocol 
version is date 24 June 2019. No major protocol amendments were made. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, 
the applicant implemented contingency measures to ensure patients' safety and manage study 
conduct. No patients had to be discontinued or discontinued due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally similar across the treatment 
groups Table 31 and Table 32). 
Median height and weight were 88.7 cm and 12.5 kg, respectively in the overall study population. 
Consistent with PFIC patients having impaired growth, median height-for-age and weight-for-age z-
scores were -1.70 and -0.95, respectively, indicating the patients were below their age-matched peers 
for growth. Review of z-scores across the treatment groups indicates that patients in the placebo and 
120 μg/kg/day groups had more impaired growth, including both height and weight, compared with 
patients in the 40 μg/kg/day group.

At baseline, serum bile acid levels were ≥250 μmol/L (≥102 μg/mL) in 25 (40%) of the 62 patients, 
including 15 (36%) of 42 patients who received odevixibat and 10 (50%) of 20 patients who received 
placebo. Median levels of serum bile acids were extremely elevated at baseline at 228.0 μmol/L (93.1 
μg/mL), 188.5 μmol/L (77.0 μg/mL), and 254.5 μmol/L (104.0 μg/mL) in the odevixibat 40 μg/kg/day, 
odevixibat 120 μg/kg/day, and placebo groups, respectively. 
Medical and Surgical History 
The medical and surgical history of patients were similar across treatments. The conditions reported 
were typical of patients with PFIC, primarily vitamin deficiencies, jaundice, pruritus and poor growth. 
Overall, 8 (13%) patients reported prior biliary tract surgeries (all reported to have undergone biliary 
diversion). 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Overall, 38 (61%) of the 62 patients reported using prior medications, mostly vitamins. None of the 
patients reported prior PFIC-related medications. 
All 62 patients took at least one concomitant medication during the treatment period. Most patients 
received concomitant medications for the treatment of pruritus and vitamin supplementation. Note that 
for patients receiving medication for pruritus, the dose/regimen was not to change. Generally, the 
types and use of these medications were similar across the treatment groups, except that a higher 
percentage of patients in the placebo group reported use of other bile acids and derivatives (UDCA)

and other antibacterials (rifampicin). Concomitant treatment with UDCA and rifampicin was permitted 
provided the patient was on a stable dosage at least 4 weeks before enrolment and no dosage changes 
were planned during the entire study period.  
In the placebo group, UDCA was administered concomitantly in 90% of patients compared with 83% 
and 68% of patients treated with odevixibat 40 and 120 μg/kg/day, respectively. Concomitant 
administration of rifampicin was reported in 90% of patients who received placebo compared with 57% 
and 63% of patients treated with odevixibat 40 and 120 μg/kg/day, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 62 patients were randomised into the study and received their assigned treatment and were 
included in the SAS and FAS; 56 patients were randomised and had no important protocol deviations 
documented and were included in the PP analysis set (Table 33).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The FAS results for the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients with at least a 70% 
reduction in serum bile acids concentration from baseline or reaching a level ≤70 μmol/L (28.6 
μg/mL), are summarised in

Table 34. A significant difference between placebo and odevixibat was observed in the decrease from 
baseline in serum bile acids after 24 weeks of treatment. 
A post hoc analysis comparing the results for the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups was also conducted. 
The results showed that there was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of serum 
bile acid responders between the 2 odevixibat dose groups (CMH stratified by PFIC type, 2-sided, p = 
0.1083).

Results for the analysis of the proportion of patients achieving positive pruritus assessment for >50% 
of the time during 24-week treatment period for AM scores and PM scores were consistent with the 
overall results for AM and PM scores combined. 
Changes from Baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 (Secondary Endpoint) and over Time in Growth 
Parameters  
Review of baseline z-scores across the treatment groups indicated that patients in the placebo and 120 
µg/kg/day groups had more impaired growth, including both height and weight, compared with 
patients in the 40 µg/kg/day group. The impact of this on subsequent growth is not known. 
Table 37 shows the change from baseline to week 24 in z-scores for height and weight.

Changes from Baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 in ALT and in Other Hepatic Biochemical 
Parameters, including AST, Total Bilirubin and GGT to Weeks 4, 12 and 24 
Table 38 provides mean (SE) baseline results and changes to Weeks 4, 12 and 24 for hepatic 
biochemical parameters. Overall, a significant improvement in hepatic parameters was observed in the 
patients treated with odevixibat. Results for the PP analysis set were similar to the results for the FAS.

Changes in liver pathology 
APRI and FIB-4 
For the APRI and FIB-4, data for the change from baseline to Week 24 analysis were available for 31 of 
the 62 patients, including 23 of the 42 patients who received odevixibat and 8 of the 20 patients who 
received placebo. The APRI scores for individual patients varied considerably over time. For all groups, 
mean (SE) changes from baseline to Week 24 for the APRI score were small: -0.14 (0.072) for the 40 
μg/kg/day group, 0.04 (0.233) for the 120 μg/kg/day group, and 0.04 (0.134) for the placebo group. 
Similar to the APRI, mean (SE) changes from baseline to Week 24 for the FIB-4 were small. 
Liver Fibrosis/Steatosis 
Limited data were available for this analysis due to the unavailability of the required equipment (e.g. 
Fibroscan) at all sites. No notable differences between the treatment groups were observed. 
PELD/MELD 
Consistent with the results observed for improvements in hepatic biochemical parameters, treatment 
with odevixibat over 24 weeks led to an improvement in PELD/MELD scores with minimal changes 
observed in the placebo group. Mean changes from baseline to Week 24 for this parameter were -1.79 
for the overall odevixibat group and were -2.43 and -1.10 in the odevixibat 40 and 120 μg/kg/day 
groups, respectively, compared with -0.66 in the placebo group. 
Number of Patients Undergoing Biliary Diversion Surgery or Liver Transplant 
None of the 62 patients underwent biliary diversion surgery or liver transplant during the study. 
Other additional secondary endpoints performed. 
Several other secondary and exploratory analysis on the FAS were performed that will not be discussed 
in the overview; details can be found in the day 60 clinical assessment report. The results all pointed in 
the same positive direction (e.g. improvement of symptoms reduction of SBAs, improvement of QoL) 
and are consistent with the primary and secondary endpoint

Ancillary analyses 
Study 005 
Subgroup analyses 
The applicant has performed several subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint in study 005. The 
point-estimate for these analyses was in favour of odevixibat treatment over placebo. For some 
subgroups limited data was available e.g. PFIC1 patients (see below). Based on the subgroup by region 
it is noticed that none of the US patients was considered a responder to treatment. 
Subgroup of PFIC 1 patients 
It is anticipated that PFIC2 patients are the patients that directly benefit from treatment as the 
mutation prevents shuttling BAs across the membrane. In PFIC1 (and PFIC3) patients, the BSEP is 
intact, and the interplay with the other membrane proteins is important, and a more marginal 
treatment effect is expected. Nevertheless, these patients also have an unmet medical need. 
For patients receiving odevixibat, the proportion of serum bile acid responders was higher for patients 
with PFIC2 (12 of 30 patients, 40.0%) compared to patients with PFIC1 (2 of 12 patients, 16.7%), 
although the comparison of each group to placebo had widely overlapping confidence intervals. Review 
of changes from baseline in serum bile acid levels for patients with PFIC1 who received odevixibat did 
show reductions in serum bile acids levels to Week 24 (Table 39). In line with the reduction of serum 
bile acids, 6/12 PFIC1 patients showed a clinical meaningful reduction of 1.0 point for pruritus score at 
Week 24, whereas in the placebo group 1/5 patients showed a clinical meaningful reduction. Further 
data on the reduction of pruritis showed that 10/12 patients showed reduction in pruritus, although in 
the placebo group also some patients showed reductions in pruritus though to a lesser extent.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integrated data patients treated with odevixibat in study 005 and 24 weeks in study 008 
The applicant conducted an integrated analysis based on studies 005 and 008. The data showed that 
under continued odevixibat treatment for the primary endpoint, e.g. the proportion of patients 
reaching at least 70% in SBAs from baseline or a level ≤70 µmol/L showed further improvements 
(Figure16). Similar to the reduction in pruritus (Figure 17).

Anthropometrics  
Figure 18 shows the pooled data on growth (Z-scores for height and weight) up to week 60 of 
odevixibat treatment. 
Mean height z-score improved from a baseline value of -1.86 to -0.78 at Week 48, representing a 
mean (SE) change of 0.52 (0.134) and mean weight z-scores increased from a baseline value 
of -1.05 to -0.02 at Week 48, representing a mean (SE) change of 0.51 (0.144). Similar results were

observed for patients who had received 120 µg/kg/day throughout their treatment course with mean 
(SE) changes from baseline to Week 48 of 0.66 (0.177) and 0.39 (0.233) in height and weight 
z-scores, respectively, and for patients who had transitioned from 40 to 120 µg/kg/day (0.38 [0.200] 
and 0.61 [0.179]), respectively.

Integrated Data).  
N/A: not applicable; SE: standard error. 
Liver histopathology 
Consistent with the results observed for improvements in hepatic biochemical parameters, long-term 
treatment with odevixibat led to improvement (decrease) in PELD/MELD scores. Mean changes from 
baseline after 48 weeks of treatment with odevixibat (either 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day dose) 
was -1.97 (0.817). Mean (SE) change in PELD/MELD scores for patients who received 120 µg/kg/day 
dose throughout their treatment course was -1.37 [1.265], and for those who transitioned from 40 
µg/kg/day to the 120 µg/kg/day dose was -2.58 [1.067] at Week 48.  
Minimal to no changes were observed in PELD/MELD scores during 24 weeks of treatment with placebo 
in Study A4250-005. After 48 weeks of odevixibat treatment, mean (SE) change from baseline in 
PELD/MELD scores for patients who had previously received placebo was 0.62 (1.464), although only 4 
patients had data available at Week 48. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Not applicable. PFIC is a paediatric disease.  
Supportive study 
Study A4250-008  
Study A4250-008 was an Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate Long-term Efficacy and Safety of 
A4250 in Children with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Types 1 and 2 (PEDFIC 2).

Methods 
Study participants 
Figure 19: Participants flow in study A4250-008 (data cut-off 15 July 2020). 
Note: Study 008 is ongoing; only interim data are available.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Cohort 1: Patients who completed the 24-week treatment period of study 005 or (prior to Amendment 
6 of the A4250-005 protocol) withdrew due to patient/caregiver judgment of intolerable symptoms 
after completing at least 12 weeks of treatment were eligible for enrolment in Cohort 1. 
Key exclusion criteria included patients with decompensated liver disease, those who were 
noncompliant with treatment in study 005, or any other conditions or abnormalities that could 
compromise the safety of the patient. 
Cohort 2: treatment naïve patients of any age and a body weight ≥5 kg with a genetically confirmed 
diagnosis of PFIC who did not meet the eligibility criteria for study 005 or were eligible for enrolment 
after recruitment in study 005 was completed were included in Cohort 2. Patients were required to 
have an elevated serum bile acids concentration ≥100 μmol/L, taken as the average of 2 samples at 
least 7 days apart during screening; a history of significant pruritus; and a caregiver-reported average 
scratching score in the eDiary of ≥2 (on a 0 to 4 scale) in the 2 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
Key exclusion criteria include patients with pathologic variations of the ABCB11 gene that predict 
complete absence of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein, prior liver transplant or planned 
transplant within 6 months, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or total bilirubin >10 × upper limit of 
normal (ULN) at screening, decompensated liver disease, any uncontrolled, recalcitrant pruritic 
condition other than PFIC, or any other conditions or abnormalities that could compromise the safety of 
the patient or their ability to complete the study.

Treatment 
Odevixibat is administered orally, once daily at a dose of 120 μg/kg/day; patients who are unable to 
tolerate the higher dose can reduce the dose to 40 μg/kg/day under specific conditions.

c For patients from France and Germany, only birth year (actual year) is collected on the CRF, and age is calculated based on collected age months and age 
years from the external file except for 2 patients in Cohort 2 from France. For these 2 patients in Cohort 2 from France, their ages may not be accurate since 
only the birth year is correctly collected and accurate age months and age years are not available.  
d The study population from Middle Eastern countries is included under race category “Caucasian.” 
In the overall study population, the median height and weight were 92.5 cm and 15.0 kg, respectively.  
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The baseline disease characteristics for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 are presented in Table 42. All 69 patients had genetic confirmation of PFIC based on central 
reader review. 
Baseline renal and hepatic functions were largely similar across the groups. Table 42: Summary of Baseline Disease Characteristics (Full Analysis

Medical and Surgical History 
Overall, the conditions reported were typical of patients with PFIC; primarily pruritus, vitamin 
deficiencies, gastrointestinal morbidities, jaundice and other hepatobiliary disorders, and poor growth. 
The medical and surgical history of patients were similar across study groups in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 
Eight (12%) patients reported prior biliary tract surgeries (i.e. biliary diversion surgeries), including 1 
(5%), 3 (20%), 2 (11%) Cohort 1 patients who had received 40 μg/kg/day odevixibat, 120 μg/kg/day 
odevixibat, and placebo, respectively in Study A4250-005 and 2 (13%) cohort 2 patients. 
Prior Medications 
Three of 16 patients (19%) in Cohort 2 reported using prior medications that were not PFIC-related. 
These included amoxicillin trihydrate; clavulanate potassium, clarithromycin, rifampicin, ibuprofen, 
lansoprazole, citric acid; sodium citrate; none were reported in >1 patient. 
Use of prior PFIC-related medications was reported in 1 patient in Cohort 2 who received odevixibat in 
the Phase 2 study A4250-003. 
Concomitant Medications  
All 69 patients took at least one concomitant medication during the treatment period. Most patients 
received concomitant medications for the treatment of pruritus and vitamin supplementation. 
Generally, the types and use of these medications were similar across the study groups, with the 
exception that a higher percentage of treatment-naïve patients (89%) reported the use of bile acids 
and derivatives (UDCA) and other antibacterials (rifampicin) compared with patients who received 
odevixibat in Study A4250-005 (71%).  
The most common concomitant medications among patients in Cohort 1 who had previously received 
odevixibat in Study A4250-005 included UDCA (24 patients, 71%), cholecalciferol (18 patients, 53%), 
rifampicin (16 patients, 47%), vitamin E NOS (12 patients, 35%), vitamin K NOS (11 patients, 32%), 
paracetamol (10 patients, 29%), and ibuprofen and phytomenadione (8 patients each, 24%).  
In patients who were treatment-naïve, the most common concomitant medications were UDCA (31 
patients, 89%), rifampicin (26 patients, 74%), vitamin K NOS (17 patients, 49%), vitamin D NOS (13 
patients, 37%), vitamin E NOS (12 patients, 34%), cholecalciferol (10 patients, 29%), and 
phytomenadione (8 patients, 23%). Two patients initiated treatment with rifampicin during the 
treatment period.

Pruritus Assessments 
Proportion of Positive Pruritus Assessments at the Patient Level Over the 24-Week 
Treatment Period Based on ObsRO. 
The results of the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at 
the patient level over the 24-week treatment period based on the combined AM and PM scores on the 
Albireo ObsRO instrument.  
For patients in Cohort 1 who had received odevixibat in Study A4250-005, who entered the study with 
improved pruritus severity compared with treatment-naïve patients, a further reduction from Study 
A4250-008 baseline in pruritus severity was observed during longer-term treatment. The mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 128/182 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of positive pruritus assessments for this group of patients was 33% after 24 weeks of 
treatment at 120 μg/kg/day on Study A4250-008. The proportion of positive pruritus assessments was 
higher for patients who had received 40 μg/kg/day (37%) than for patients who had received 120 
μg/kg/day (27%) during Study A4250-005. 
Mean proportion of positive pruritus assessments over the 24-week treatment period in treatment-
naïve patients was higher than that observed for patients in Cohort 1 who had previously received 
odevixibat in Study A4250-005. For patients in Cohort 1 who had received placebo in A4250-005, the 
proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the patient level was 56% over the 24-week treatment 
period. In Cohort 2, the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the patient level was 62% over 
the 24-week treatment period, although limited data were available for this cohort through Week 24. 
Growth  
Improvement in growth was noted over time in all study groups in Cohort 1 and in Cohort 2. 
Changes in Liver Pathology 
PELD/MELD scores 
Treatment with odevixibat over 24 weeks led to an improvement in PELD/MELD scores in all groups 
except the Cohort 2 group, which only had data available for 2 patients at Week 24. For PELD/MELD 
the mean (SE) changes from baseline to Week 24 were -0.09 (0.51) and -0.29 (0.31) in patients who 
had received 40 μg/kg/day or 120 μg/kg/day in study 005. For patients who had received placebo in 
study 005 this was -1.40 (1.21). For patients in Cohort 2 the mean (SE) changes from baseline to 
Week 24 was 1.74 (5.83). 
Liver Fibrosis/Steatosis 
Limited data were available for this analysis; changes from baseline to Week 24 for liver stiffness were 
tabulated for a total of 8 patients, including 6 patients in Cohort 1 (2 in the 40 μg/kg/day group, 1 in 
the 120 μg/kg/day group, and 3 in the placebo group), and for 2 patients in Cohort 2. Only 1 patient in 
Cohort 1 (the 120 μg/kg/day group) had data available for controlled attenuation at Week 24. Mean 
changes from baseline to Week 24 for liver stiffness were 1.50 kPa (mean change calculated for 1 
patient in the 40 μg/kg/day group), 0.30 (1.701) kPa in the Cohort 1 placebo group, and 1.55 
(0.6250) kPa in the 2 patients in Cohort 2, respectively. 
Biliary Diversion Surgery or Liver Transplantation  
Two patients in this study underwent surgical intervention due to lack of improvement in pruritus. 
Patient 19101-502, 1.4-year-old male with PFIC2/BSEP subtype 1, who received placebo in Study 
A4250-005, underwent biliary diversion surgery at Week 37 and Patient 24103-503, a 2.8-year-old 
male with PFIC2/ BSEP subtype 1, who also received placebo in Study A4250-005, underwent elective 
liver transplantation at Week 19. Patient 19101-502 did not experience a reduction in serum bile acids 
levels prior to surgery; a 25% reduction in serum bile acids was reported at Patient 24103-503’s last 
assessment (Week 12) before the surgery. 
Other additional secondary endpoints performed. 
In line with the pivotal study, several other secondary and exploratory analysis on the FAS were 
performed that will not be discussed in this report. Additional results pertaining to reduction of SBAs, 
improvement of sleep parameters, reduced scratching all pointed in a similar positive direction and are 
consistent with the primary and secondary endpoint. Note that not all patients already had 24 weeks of 
treatment in study 008.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
General 
A single pivotal study (A4250-005) was submitted to support the proposed indication. Given the rarity 
of PFIC only a limited number of patients could be enrolled; hence this is acceptable to the CHMP and 
not uncommon for orphan diseases. The pivotal study met the requirements as outlined in the 
guideline on “points to consider on application with 1. meta-analyses; 2. one pivotal study” 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99). Further, the design of the clinical studies has previously been discussed with 
the EMA at various PRIME and SAWP procedures, and for the most part the studies followed the 
advices received. The studies have been conducted in accordance with the protocols; and it is 
considered that the reported protocol deviations had only minor and no consequence. 
The indication applied for is the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in 
patients aged 6 months and older. To substantiate the indication, one randomised double-blinded 
placebo-controlled study (study 005) enrolling 62 paediatric patients, and one long term open-label 
follow-up study (study 008) are conducted. The proposed dose is supported by a dose-finding study 
003.  
Study 003 
In the open-label dose-finding study 003, six dose cohorts were included. The study was originally 
designed to evaluate doses up to 300 µg/kg/day. However, two patients with Alagille syndrome in the 
200 µg/kg/day cohort experienced elevations in LFTs >2 times baseline. Therefore, dosing up to 200 
µg/kg/day was considered. Patients received a single dose of odevixibat and 2 weeks after the single-
dose administration patients received multiple-dose treatment for 4 weeks. For efficacy evaluation 
serum bile acids, reduction of pruritis and sleep were measured. In addition, liver biochemical 
parameters were also evaluated as these may indicate reductions in hepatic damage, given that in 
patients with cholestatic disease, as in patients with PFIC, these endpoints are accepted by the CHMP. 
Safety evaluation is considered standard and is normally seen in clinical applications. 
Study 005 
Study 005 is a randomised placebo-controlled study in paediatric patients with PFIC type 1 and 2. The 
in- and exclusion criteria are appropriate to select the relevant paediatric patients with PFIC1 and 
PFIC2 with some functionality of the BSEP protein. The inclusion criterion for serum bile acids to be 
≥100 μmol/L is determined based on the results from the Phase 2 study 003 and on information in the 
literature.  
Two patients had baseline values ≤70 μmol\L and one patient had baseline value ≤ 100 µmol/L which 
is not in line with the inclusion criteria. The serum bile acid results were blinded during the Treatment 
Period (Visits 3-9) and the Follow-up Period (Visit 10). Serum bile acid results were kept unblinded 
during the Screening Period (Visits 1 and 2) to confirm study eligibility (Inclusion Criteria #3; Patient 
must have elevated sBA concentration, specifically measured to be ≥100 µmol/L, taken as the average 
of 2 samples at least 7 days apart [Visits 1 and 2] prior to randomisation). As the calculation of serum 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 130/182 
 
 
 
 
bile acid eligibility and baseline serum bile acid used in analysis differ based on the visits in which the 
samples were obtained, some patients do in fact have a baseline serum bile acid that is less than the 
100 µmol/L eligibility requirement. 
Fifty-six patients were included in the per-protocol analysis (PP). The full analysis set (FAS) and PP 
populations only differ by 2 patients in each of the 3 arms. Six patients in the FAS were excluded from 
the PP analysis set as they had treatment compliance rates <80%, where the compliance rate was 
calculated based on actual duration of exposure for each patient. Patients who discontinued treatment 
early from the study due to the lack of efficacy or adverse events were not specifically excluded from 
the PP analysis set unless they met one of the criteria detailed above. Data from these were included 
as a conservative approach to the analysis of efficacy (i.e. included as treatment failures). 
With regard to the reason for early treatment discontinuation of ‘intolerable symptoms’, this was to be 
reported for patients who elected to roll over early to the long-term extension Study A4250-008 and 
was specifically reported for patients who had a perceived lack of effect of treatment on pruritus 
symptoms (i.e. intolerable pruritus symptoms).  
Three patients previously treated in study 003 were also enrolled (1 patient in each treatment arm) in 
study 005. These patients did not roll over directly from study 003 to study 005, but there was a 
“wash-out” period of at least 1.8 years. 
Patients received either 40 μg/kg/day odevixibat (n=23), 120 μg/kg/day odevixibat (n=19) or placebo 
(n=20). After 24 weeks of treatment patients could enrol in the long-term follow study 008. A patient 
who had tolerability issues or lack of efficacy could also be rolled-over to study 008 if at least 12 weeks 
of treatment were completed. The doses administered in study 005 are in line with the dose 
recommendations in SmPC section 4.2. Dose reductions were not allowed in this study. Based on the 
proposed posology, some patients may be under- or overdosed depending on their bodyweight. The 
applicant elaborate that based on toxicology data, any odevixibat dose exceeding a total of >3 mg/kg 
(>3000 µg/kg) administered as a single dose or as a cumulative dose within 24 hours is defined as an 
overdose.  
Patients were allowed to have UDCA and rifampicin as concomitant medication if they were on a stable 
dose 4 weeks prior to inclusion, and the dose was to be remained (no dose adjustments allowed) 
during the study. Two patients initiated treatment with rifampicin during the treatment period (1 
patient in the placebo and 1 patient in the 120 μg/kg/day group). Protocol deviations were reported for 
both patients. Given that rifampicin alleviates pruritus this might impact the observed results; 
however, as one patient was in the placebo group this is not a considered an issue; the clinical effect of 
odevixibat on pruritus is larger than in the placebo group. The patient in the 120 μg/kg/day group was 
rolled-over to study 008, which is considered acceptable.  
Primary Efficacy endpoint: In study 005, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients 
experiencing at least a 70% reduction in serum bile acids (SBAs) concentration from baseline to the 
end of treatment or reaching a level ≤70 μmol/L (28.6 μg/mL) after 24 weeks of treatment. This was 
discussed and agreed upon within SA.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The important secondary endpoint was the proportion of positive 
pruritus assessments for AM and PM scores combined at the patient level over the 24-week treatment 
period based on the Albireo ObsRO instrument. Further, the applicant was advised to submit an 
analysis of the number (%) of patients achieving a positive pruritus assessment (AM and PM Scores 
Combined) for more than 50% of the time during the 24-week treatment period.  
Use of the Obsro and Pro for pruritus and sleep disturbance: The Obsro and Pro for pruritus and sleep 
disturbance have been validated, based on blinded interim data in study 005, against the Patient 
Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Patient Global Impression of Symptoms (PGIS), and Paediatric 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 131/182 
 
 
 
Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). The equivalent for Global Impression of Change and Global 
Impression of Symptoms for the caregiver and clinician was also used. All measures were also 
individual endpoints in study 005. It was agreed by CHMP using interim data of study 005 in a blinded 
way to estimate a threshold for clinically meaningful change to use in the responder analysis of 
pruritus endpoints. This tool was discussed and agreed with during SA. As part of the efficacy analysis 
of the secondary endpoint, the applicant pre-specified a responder definition as a change in 1 point or 
greater of the PRO and ObsPRO from baseline. While the analysis did tend to support the applicant’s 
definition of the degree of change in the pruritus PRO and ObsdPRO which would constitute a clinically 
meaningful difference, there are some aspects which limit the validity of this result. While the results 
of the analysis of the ObsPRO were positive, the small number of observations for the PRO meant that 
the outcome of that analysis cannot be relied upon. This is probably a function of age of the patient 
population, which was such as to make the ObsPEO more appropriate for the majority of those enrolled 
in the study. Nevertheless, it is premature to state that the results in themselves validate the definition 
of an MCID for all patients. In addition, the results used by the applicant only come from a single trial. 
The CHMP considered that the first analysis of the data generated in Study 005 using data should be 
confirmed from a separate study. In this regard, the applicant was recommended to consider using 
data from newly enrolled patients into Study 008 to verify the preliminary results. Given these 
limitations, it is premature to conclude that a change in 1 point in the pruritus PRO and ObsPRO 
constitutes an MCID. Consequently, it is not necessary to mention such an MCID in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC.  
Study 008 
Study 008 is an open-label long term follow-up study in which PFIC patients receive 120 μg/kg/day 
odevixibat up to 72 weeks. For long term follow-up patients previously treated, or those that receive 
placebo, in study 005 could enrol in cohort 1 of this study. Cohort 2 included treatment were not 
eligible for study 005. Further, as already mentioned above some patients were considered early 
rollover from study 005, these need some further clarification.  
Choice of dose for study 005 and 008 
Initially, the applicant chose the 120 μg/kg/day dose in study 008. The choice was made prior to the 
data of study 005 was unblinded. The choice was based on an animal-to-human conversion factor of 
12.3, the ED50, ED90, and ED95 of odevixibat were 4.39, 39.5 and 83.4 μg/kg, respectively. Further, 
nonclinical findings were confirmed in the clinical Phase 1 dose-finding, PK and PD study, A4250-001, 
conducted in healthy adults. In evaluating the effect of multiple dosing of odevixibat for 7 days on 
systemic bile acids levels using a maximum effect model (Emax), it was found that odevixibat lowered 
serum bile acids levels in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50, ED90, and ED95, of 12.3, 111, and 
234 μg/kg. Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in the AUC0-12 of C4, a biomarker for the rate of bile 
acids synthesis, was observed on Day 7. Again, using an Emax model, the estimated ED50, ED90, and 
ED95 were 18.1, 162, and 344 μg/kg, respectively. 
In the 4-week Phase 2 study conducted in paediatric patients with cholestatic liver disease, Study 003, 
the dose range selected – from 10 to 200 μg/kg – provided adequate coverage relative to the ED50, 
ED90, and ED95 from the Phase 1 study. In this study, improvements in serum bile acids and pruritus 
were observed after treatment with odevixibat at doses ranging from 30 to 200 μg/kg/day. Patients 
with PFIC responded well across the dose range, including statistically significant reductions in bile 
acids levels and increases in C4; however, a clear dose relationship could not be established. Further, 
there were no significant differences in the safety profile of the dose groups up to 200 μg/kg/day.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 132/182 
 
 
 
The data from this Phase 2 study, taken together with the nonclinical data and the data from Study 
A4250-001, demonstrated a consistent PK/PD relationship for odevixibat. The lack of a dose-response 
in Study 003 may reflect the very sparse sample collection scheme used in the study. As efficacy was 
observed at both low and high doses in Study 003, and the safety profile appeared comparable, dose 
levels of 40 μg/kg/day (approximately 3× ED50) and 120 μg/kg/day (approximately ED90) were 
selected for evaluation in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 005. This is agreed with; however, based on the 
study data from 005, it appears that the 40 μg/kg/day has a (numerically) better and sustained 
efficacy on the endpoints, the treatment effect is more pronounced at treatment initiation and a better 
overall safety profile. Post hoc analyses to compare the results for the primary analyses of pruritus and 
serum bile acids across the 40 and 120 µg/kg/day groups showed that there was no statistically 
significant difference between the 2 odevixibat dose groups for the proportion of positive pruritus 
assessments at the patient level over the 24-week treatment period (2-sided p-value = 0.5008) or in 
the proportion of serum bile acid responders (2-sided p-value = 0.1083). 
However, as the choice for 120 μg/kg/day was made without further scientific discussion, the choice 
was not fully supported. The applicant was requested to compare the results from patients who started 
on 40 µg/kg/day in study 005 and switched to 120 µg/kg/day in study 008, and those who started on 
120 µg/kg/day and remained on this dose. Although limited data is available it indicates that most 
patients who started on 40 µg/kg/day remained a responder. Nine of 20 patients that were not a 
responder on 40 µg/kg/day, an additional 4 became a responder when treated with 120 µg/kg/day. 
The applicant hence proposed the 40 µg/kg/day as the starting dose, which is agreed with. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Given the debilitating intractable pruritus in PFIC patients and the progression to cirrhosis and 
ultimately liver failure requiring OLT, the reduction of pruritus and improvement of liver-related 
parameters are considered important for the B/R discussion. 
Study 003 
A reduction in the primary efficacy endpoint, total serum bile acid level, was observed at the end of the 
4-week treatment period with odevixibat for all dose groups. In addition, for most PFIC patients, 
improvements in pruritus and sleep were observed in all dose cohorts.  
As efficacy was observed at both low and high doses, the 40 μg/kg and 120 μg/kg/day were 
considered to be the optimal doses for evaluation in the pivotal study (005). The chosen doses are 
considered sufficiently justified.  
Study 005 
Baseline data: Study 005 included paediatric patients with PFIC 1 (n=12) or PFIC 2 (n=30). The 
median age was 3.2 years (min, max 0.5, 15.9 years). Among the PFIC 2 patients, 6 patients had the 
BSEP1 and 24 patients had the BSEP2 mutation. Although the number of enrolled patients is limited, 
given the rarity of the disease, this is considered acceptable.  
As in the clinical practice, PFIC patients have intractable pruritis, which is difficult to suppress despite 
off label use of medications (e.g. UDCA or rifampicin) the only alternatives for these patients are SBD 
or liver transplantation. It is known that not in all patients who underwent SBD the disease symptoms 
will alleviate, requiring additional symptomatic treatment. Eight patients (13%) enrolled in the study 
had undergone SBD at least 6 months prior to enrolment in the study. This is in line with the in- and 
exclusion criteria and agreed with. This information is correctly included in SmPC section 5.1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 133/182 
 
 
 
Based on the inclusion criteria patients were to have some functional protein; BSEP1 and BSEP2 are 
PFIC2 types that according to literature should have BSEP protein function left, according to literature 
BSEP3 is considered to have non-functional protein. In study 005 of the included patients with PFIC2, 
12/45 had BSEP1 and 33/45 BSEP2. Based on the exclusion criteria patients with pathologic variations 
of the ABCB11 gene that predicted the complete absence of the BSEP protein were excluded. According 
to literature BSEP3 are considered the mutations that relates to none functional protein (Wessel et al., 
2020). Hence, zero PFIC2 patients with BSEP3 were included; however, two patients with BSEP3 were 
included in study 008. See discussion further below. It is unknown whether patients with PFIC1 or 
PFIC3 are also patients with some protein functionality or absence of functionality. Although such 
information may help to potentially decide if a patient will benefit from odevixibat treatment, it is 
anticipated that this data is likely not available.  
Serum bile acids: The primary endpoint (PE) the proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% 
reduction in serum bile acids concentration from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level 
≤70 μmol/L (28.6 μg/mL) after 24 weeks of treatment was met.  
In the FAS, after 24 weeks of odevixibat treatment, there were 33.3% responders [14/42 patients] in 
the overall group (43.5% [10/23 patients] and 21.1% [4/19 patients] in the odevixibat 40 μg/kg/day 
and odevixibat 120 μg/kg/day groups respectively), there were no responders [0/20 patients] in the 
placebo group. Similar results were observed in the PP population. Although only a limited number 
(n=14) of patients were considered a responder, this can be considered a benefit for the patient in this 
progressive disease for which there is an unmet medical need.  
Based on literature references, it was demonstrated that after SBD PFIC2 patients showed a reduction 
of 75% in SBAs. Therefore, a post-hoc analysis “Analysis of Number (%) of Patients Experiencing at 
Least a 75% Reduction in Fasting Serum Bile Acid Concentration from Baseline to Last Visit” was 
conducted; these results are like the results regarding the primary endpoint. 
The applicant performed a subgroup analysis in PFIC1 patients. Data showed that 2/12 PFIC1 patients 
met the criteria for a responder while in the placebo group none of the patients responded. When 
looking at the change from baseline to week 24 in SBAs, data shows that all 12 PFIC1 patients had 
reductions of SBAs; in contrast, SBAs increased in the placebo group. The data on PFIC1 patients 
suggests that odevixibat is somewhat less effective compared to PFIC2. In all subgroup analyses (e.g. 
by age category, hepatic impairment classification, Child-Pugh classification (A and B), BSEP type, use 
of UDCA and/or rifampicin) odevixibat treatment was superior over placebo. There were no patients 
included with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), this is clearly stated in the SmPC. 
The subgroup analysis per region shows that, in contrast to the other regions, in the US none of the 5 
patients in the odevixibat groups where responders. Given the patient numbers is somewhat 
unexpected. This observation might be explained by the small sample size in this subgroup. It was 
shown that all 5 US patients experienced a reduction in serum bile acid levels and/or had a clinically 
meaningful reduction in pruritus symptoms during treatment with odevixibat. Fewer patients in the US 
were receiving rifampicin or UDCA and/or rifampicin at baseline.  
Subgroup analysis for PFIC1 patients revealed that under continued odevixibat treatment some 
patients with PFIC1 showed beneficial results in the reduction of pruritis irrespective whether sBAs 
showed large reductions, e.g. some PFIC1 had SBAs level fluctuating around baseline levels.  
It has been included in the SmPC section 4.4 that “The mechanism of action of odevixibat requires 
some function in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; conditions or medications that impair either 
GI motility or enterohepatic circulation of bile acids have the potential to reduce the efficacy of 
odevixibat”. In addition, given that the efficacy of odevixibat may be reduced or that not all patients 
may respond satisfactorily to treatment, it is also stated that patients should be regularly monitored 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 134/182 
 
 
 
and if the disease progresses, or efficacy is not considered optimal in terms of reducing pruritus after 6 
months of continuous odevixibat treatment, other treatment options should be considered.  
Pruritis: The reduction of pruritis was included as a secondary endpoint. It was defined as the 
proportion of positive pruritus assessments for AM and PM scores combined at the patient level over 
the 24-week treatment period based on the Albireo ObsRO instrument. The data showed a statically 
significant, but moreover a clinically significant improvement, in the reduction of pruritus (AM night-
time and PM daytime measures combined) after 24 weeks of odevixibat over placebo. Patients in the 
40 μg/kg group have a slightly better improvement over the 120 μg/kg group; LS Mean Difference 
(SE) (odevixibat – placebo): 28.23 (9.182) and 21.71 (9.892) for the 40 μg/kg and 120 μg/kg 
respectively. No major differences were observed between the AM as the PM results separately. 
Additional requested mixed model-repeated measures (MMRM) analyses for the proportion of positive 
pruritus assessments over time (in 4-week intervals) showed that the results were consistent with the 
results from the ANCOVA analysis by each 4-week interval.  
The proportion of patients achieving a positive pruritus assessment for >50% of the 24-week 
treatment period was 61.9% for the overall odevixibat group, including 73.9% and 47.4% of patients 
in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups, respectively, compared with 20.0% in the placebo group. 
In line with reducing serum bile acids, 6/12 PFIC1 patients showed a reduction of 1.0 point for pruritus 
score at Week 24, whereas in the placebo group, 1/5 patients showed a reduction. During the SAs the 
applicant was requested to discuss the clinical relevance of the 1-point reduction on the pruritus scale 
in the submission. As can be learned from the tools, the measurement characteristics of the ObsRO 
pruritus measure have been established. The measure is reliable, valid, and sensitive to change. 
Thresholds for meaningful change from Baseline to Week 24 have been established. Therefore, the 
developed ObsRO instrument is fit to evaluate pruritus among paediatric patients with PFIC in study 
005. Further data in study 005 on the reduction of pruritis showed that 10/12 patients showed a 
reduction in pruritus, although in the placebo group, some patients also showed reductions in pruritus 
though to a lesser extent. Although the patient numbers are limited it can be concluded that odevixibat 
is also effective in the treatment of pruritus in PFIC1 patients; data from study A4250-008 indeed 
confirms that PFIC1 patients also benefit from treatment with odevixibat. Two additional PFIC1 patients 
were enrolled (in cohort 2) the interim data shows that both patients also showed a reduction in 
pruritus. 
It is noticed that for the tables pertaining to the analysis of the proportion of positive pruritus 
assessments (AM and PM Scores Combined, AM scores, and PM scores) at the patient level over the 
24-week treatment period, the AM and PM baseline scores were rounded. This was due to the discrete 
nature of the pruritus scores (i.e. 5-point scale from 0 to 4), the rounded average baseline score for 
AM and the rounded average baseline score for PM from the 14 days prior to the first dose of study 
treatment were used in the derivation of a positive assessment, which was conducted at each of the 
daily post-baseline AM and PM assessments, and subsequently these values were used in the analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model for the analysis of the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at 
the subject level over the 24-week treatment period. The applicant performed a post-hoc analysis 
based on the unrounded pruritis baseline values; results were consistent with the primary endpoint 
results which were based on rounded baseline pruritus scores, results based on the unrounded baseline 
pruritus score over the 24-week treatment period demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
in pruritus for odevixibat overall (one-sided p = 0.0018), 40 µg/kg/day (one-sided p = 0.0009), and 
120 µg/kg/day (one-sided p = 0.0230) compared with placebo. 
Liver pathology: Reductions in hepatic biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, total bilirubin and GGT) 
were observed with minimal changes observed in the placebo group. Although exploratory endpoints, 
the PELD/MELD, APRI, and FIB-4 scores are in line with the improvements with the hepatic biochemical 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 135/182 
 
 
 
parameters. Data on liver fibrosis/steatosis, although limited, also indicated a delay of liver damage. 
Further, the applicant discussed the results of a patient listed for biliary diversion surgery being 
removed from the list due to the beneficial effect of odevixibat treatment. In addition, at data cut-off 
(4 December 2020) none of the patients was listed for transplant. In contrast, two patients who did 
not respond to treatment received a surgical intervention. 
Growth: Data on height and weight (z-scores) suggest that compared to placebo, the patients treated 
with odevixibat had some marginal improvement in both parameters over 24 weeks of treatment over 
placebo. However, 24 weeks seem to be too short to make firm assumptions; patients were continued 
on odevixibat 120 µg/kg/day in study 008. See respective paragraph under study 008 for further 
discussion. The improvements in anthropometrics contribute to the overall benefit. 
Other clinical efficacy endpoints: Several other secondary and exploratory parameters were measured, 
most pertained to the measurement of SBAs and pruritis (change from BL). All analyses pointed in the 
same positive direction, are consistent with the primary and important secondary endpoints and favour 
odevixibat treatment over placebo.  
Study 008 and pooled results 
Baseline data: Demographics characteristics were generally similar across the study groups in Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2. At data cut-off (4 December 2020) a total of 79 PFIC patients enrolled in study A4250-
008, although limited this is not uncommon for orphan diseases, and thus acceptable. The median age 
of the 79 patients at study entry was 3.8 years (4 months to 25 years). Only two patients aged 18 
years and older were included. Consistent with patients with PFIC having impaired growth, median 
height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores were -1.46 and -0.54, respectively, indicating the patients 
were below their age-matched peers for growth. In cohort 1, 17 patients with PFIC type 1 and 39 
patients with PFIC type 2 were included. These patients previously were treated with odevixibat or 
placebo in study 005. Also, the patients that were considered early roll-overs are included in cohort 1.  
Baseline disease characteristics of study 005 completers and early rollovers indicated that early 
rollover patients were PFIC2 (9/38, 24%) vs PFIC1 (2/16, 13%) and baseline pruritus score of ≥ 3 
(7/27, 26%) vs score of <3 (4/27, 15%). No differences were observed in other baseline 
characteristics, including the use of UDCA and/or rifampicin, baseline hepatic biochemical parameters, 
and baseline serum bile acids levels. In cohort 2, five patients with PFIC type 1, twelve patients with 
PFIC type 2, five patients with PFIC type 3, and one patient with PFIC 6 (Myo5B) were included. This 
MyoB5 patient is the same patient as included in study 003.  
For the twelve PFIC2 patients in cohort 2, one patient (27.3%) was considered BSEP type 1, four 
(54.5%) BSEP type 2 and two (18.2%) BSEP type 3. Both patients with BSEP3 had two truncated 
mutations and therefore were expected to have minimal (to no) residual protein functionality based on 
the central review of the genetic report. Neither of the patients experienced any clinically meaningful 
treatment effects following approximately 24 weeks of dosing with odevixibat 120 µg/kg/day as 
evidenced by unchanged serum bile acid levels and no improvement in pruritus severity scores. Hence, 
these patients should not be initiated on odevixibat, but should be offered alternative intervention(s). 
The applicant included a warning in the SmPC (section 4.4) mentioning that “patients with PFIC2 who 
have a complete absence or lack of function of Bile Salt Export Pump (BSEP) protein will not respond to 
odevixibat”. This is agreed with by the CHMP. 
One patient (PFIC1; cohort 2) had baseline value <70 µmol/L which is not conform the in- and 
exclusion criteria, however given the explanation above (study 005) this is considered acceptable. The 
difference in baseline hepatic parameters (AST, ALT, bilirubin) is logical, as patients previously treated 
with odevixibat had improvements in these parameters, whereas patients previously on placebo and 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 136/182 
 
 
 
those in cohort 2 did not receive treatment. Overall the hepatic parameters in all patients are 
indicative of hepatic damage. 
The medical and surgical history of patients were similar across study groups in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, 
are typical for PFIC patients. In cohort 2 two patients had a history of biliary diversion, whereas in 
cohort 1 six patients had a history of biliary diversion. The latter patients had their surgery conform to 
the protocol of study 005 performed at least 6 months prior to enrolment in study 005.  
Generally, the types and use of concomitant medications were similar across the study groups, with 
the exception that a higher percentage of treatment-naïve patients (89%) reported the use of bile 
acids and derivatives (UDCA) and other antibacterials (rifampicin) compared with patients who 
received odevixibat in study 005 (71%).  
Serum bile acids: Fourteen patients in Cohort 2 had data available at Week 22/24 at the time of the 
data cut-off (4 December 2020). The mean (SE) change from baseline study 008 to week 24 was 65.3 
(28.4) %. The patients previously treated with odevixibat in study 005 showed further improvement in 
reducing SBAs under continued treatment (change from BL after 24 weeks in study 008 40 μg/kg/day: 
-5.8%; 120 μg/kg/day: -14.8%). For the patients who previously received placebo a similar rapid 
reduction of SBAs as was observed in the treatment groups in the pivotal study, confirming the 
pharmacodynamic properties of odevixibat.  
Data on the change from baseline to week 24 in study A4250-008 for patients treated with odevixibat 
in study A4250-005 show that under continued odevixibat treatment patients had further improvement 
in most subgroup analyses. Data on six patients with a normal hepatic function conform the National 
Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI ODWG) at study 008 entry. This was due to 
treatment in the preceding study 005. At study 005 baseline these 6 patients all had mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment based on the NCI ODWG and the Child-Pugh classification. The 6 patients included 
4 males and 2 females and ranged in age from 0.9 to 9.2 years; all 6 had PFIC2. It was shown that 
these 6 patients all achieved substantial improvements in serum bile acids concentrations prior to 
entry into study 008 with baseline serum bile acids ranging from 2.5 to 103.5 µmol/L. The patients 
then maintained or showed additional improvements over the course of treatment in study 008. At 
Week 24 in Study 008, 5 of the 6 patients had reductions in serum bile acids from Study 005 baseline 
of >85% and for 1, the reduction was 57%. 
Pruritus: For patients in Cohort 1 - who had received odevixibat (40 or 120 µg/kg/day) in study 005 -, 
who entered the study with improved pruritus severity compared with treatment-naïve patients, a 
further reduction from Study 008 baseline in pruritus severity was observed during longer-term 
treatment with 120 µg/kg/day. The mean proportion of positive pruritus assessments for this group of 
patients was 34.3 % after 24 weeks of treatment at 120 μg/kg/day in study 008. The proportion of 
positive pruritus assessments was higher for patients who had received 40 μg/kg/day (39.6 %) than 
those who had received 120 μg/kg/day (27.4 %) during Study 005. For the patients (n=19) previously 
on placebo in study A4250-005, 59.3% showed a response. This confirms the efficacy of continued 
odevixibat treatment in PFIC patients. The pooled data of both studies are in line with these results, 
showing that under continued odevixibat treatment the proportion of positive pruritus assessments at 
the patient level is increasing up to week 48. For the naïve patients enrolled in cohort 2 this proportion 
was 78.4%. 
Changes in Liver Pathology: Data on the change from baseline to week 48 for ALT, GGT, and total 
bilirubin showed that for the patients previously treated with odevixibat continued treatment further 
improved the parameters. Notably, patients who were treatment naïve (previous placebo group and 
cohort 2) also showed improvements except for ALT. Some variability in mean changes over time was 
observed for both ALT and total bilirubin across the cohorts; these are related to individual patients 
with transient elevations in these parameters, typically related to intercurrent illness – most of whom 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 137/182 
 
 
 
have recovery of the elevations within 1 or 2 visits. Baseline study 008 values indicate that most 
patients were likely to have minimal fibrosis (e.g. APRI score about 0.64, APRI <0.5 is indicative for 
not having fibrosis, whilst APRI >1.5 is indicative for likelihood to have fibrosis). Notably the patients 
in cohort 1 already received odevixibat treatment and PELD/MELD scores marginally improved during 
treatment in study 005. Continued treatment with odevixibat 120 µg/kg/day over 48 weeks in study 
008 led to a further improvement in PELD/MELD scores for the patients previously treated with 
odevixibat in study 005. For the patients (n=19) previously enrolled in study 005 24 weeks of 
treatment in study 008 PELD/MELD score improved; mean (SE) -2.86 (1.9). Longer term data up to 60 
weeks (available for cohort 1 patients) in study 008 indicates some further improvement/stabilisation. 
It is therefore concluded that currently only short-term data is available for odevixibat which indicate 
an improvement in the biochemical markers of cholestasis and an improvement or at least a 
stabilisation of the PELD/MELD scores for over one year. 
Only limited data on fibrosis is available. For both APRI and FIB-4 scores, differences were limited. The 
observed short-term improvements in APRI scores and the stabilisation of FIB-4 scores in patients 
treated with odevixibat are indicative of stabilisation of disease progression or improvement in fibrosis 
staging. It remains to be demonstrated whether these early observations will be maintained over a 
longer time and will result in delay of SBD and/or OLT.  
Growth: Data on height (z-scores) show that patients previously treated with odevixibat in study 005 
(Cohort 1) showed further improvement from BL to week 60 in study 008 under continued odevixibat 
120 µg/kg/day treatment. Patients previously on placebo also showed improvement in gaining length, 
this is in line with the results in the pivotal study. Data up to week 60 in cohort 1 suggests that 
patients will still catch up growth. This is confirmed by the pooled analysis in growth; treatment with 
odevixibat (40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day) led to clinically relevant improvement in growth over 
time, indicating catch-up growth. Mean height z-scores improved to -0.78 at Week 48, representing a 
mean (SE) change of 0.52 (0.134). Mean weight z-scores increased to -0.02 at Week 48, representing 
a mean (SE) change of 0.51 (0.144). Similar results were observed for patients who had received 
120 µg/kg/day throughout their treatment course with mean (SE) changes from baseline to Week 48 
of 0.66 (0.177) and 0.39 (0.233) in height and weight z-scores, respectively. Notably, the patients 
included in cohort 2 also showed improvement up to week 24 in study 008. Although the data is 
limited beyond week 24 the results are consistent with the results observed in patients previously 
treated in study 005. The observed growth improvement is comparable to the effects observed 
following surgical intervention (i.e. 1-year data post biliary diversion surgery or liver transplantation).  
Other clinical efficacy endpoints: Several other secondary and exploratory parameters were measured, 
most pertained to the measurement of SBAs and pruritis (change from BL). The data showed that 
patients previously receiving odevixibat in study 005 continued to improve in these endpoints, 
confirming the beneficial effects of odevixibat. The observed changes are consistent with the primary 
and important secondary endpoint. For the patients previously on placebo similar changes from BL to 
24 weeks of treatment in study 008 were observed, as in study 005. Data on the QoL are also 
consistent with the results on the reduction of pruritus.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of an MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
It is considered that odevixibat demonstrated a clear clinically relevant effect on the main symptoms of 
PFIC e.g. reduction of pruritus. In addition, clinically relevant reductions in sBAs were observed. From 
the literature, it is known that the reduction of serum bile acid levels, ASAT, total bilirubin or 
improvement of PELD or MELD is associated with prolonged native liver survival in PFIC1 and PFIC2 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 138/182 
 
 
 
patients. However, it was also indicated that the predictive value of SBAs in PFIC1 and PFIC2 does not 
qualify the SBAs as a surrogate parameter for liver survival. In the clinical studies conducted, the 
current data does not allow to convincingly conclude whether odevixibat effectively delays surgery 
(SBD) and/or OLT despite the improvements in hepatic parameters and liver histopathology 
parameters. In order to provide further solid information on this fact, a long-term follow-up study 
would be required.  
The applicant applied for an MA under exceptional circumstances with the main reason that indications 
for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot 
reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence (see EMEA/357981/2005). It should be 
noted that the orphan drug designation in the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
was granted on the basis of the rarity of the disease; the prevalence of PFIC in Europe was estimated 
at 0.07/10,000 persons. The life expectancy is short, depending on the type of PFIC and due to severe 
hepatic damage, the condition ultimately leads to portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation is often necessary. Given the orphan designation of 
odevixibat in the EU, the size of the target population and the clinical studies already conducted, CHMP 
considered that it is unlikely that the applicant will be in a position to generate comprehensive data on 
efficacy.  
In order to investigate further a possible effect of odevixibat on surgery and / or liver transplantation 
the Applicant has proposed to set up a registry to record registry information on liver survival, SBD 
and death. As a Specific Obligation in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances, the Applicant agreed to conduct a post-authorisation registry-based efficacy study to 
investigate whether odevixibat treatment delays SBD and/or liver transplantation, with matched 
comparison against untreated PFIC patients.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results of the submitted clinical development programme, odevixibat was proven to be 
effective in the reduction of SBAs and reduction of pruritis in patients with PFIC1, PFIC2, PFIC 3 and 
PFIC6. The applicant has thoroughly substantiated that the data collected in mainly in the PFIC1, PFIC2 
and to a lesser extent in PFIC3 and PFIC6 patients can be extrapolated to the broader PFIC patient 
population as claimed indication “treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in 
patients aged 6 months or older”. Extrapolation is based on the fact, that all PFIC patients share the 
same disease pathophysiology pathway, i.e. odevixibat acts upon the IBAT receptor which is similar to 
all PFIC patients. Other PFIC types (i.e. PFIC4 and 5) are encountered so rarely that it is considered 
unfeasible to study these PFIC types separately.  
The clinical relevance of reducing 70% in SBAs (change from BL) and reduction of pruritus (change 
from BL) has been sufficiently substantiated. In the pivotal study, two doses were investigated, i.e. 40 
and 120 µg/kg/day; post-hoc analyses showed that both doses are equally effective in reducing SBAs 
and reducing pruritus (e.g. no statistically significant difference). However, based on the additional 
requested analysis a starting dose of 40 µg/kg/day is considered most appropriate and agreed with by 
the CHMP. Based on the study results it appears that at least numerically the 40 µg/kg/day is 
somewhat more effective. In addition, safety suggests a similar observation; patients in the 40 
µg/kg/day groups have numerically less diarrhoea. It is now mentioned in the SmPC that if after 3 
months of 40 µg/kg/day odevixibat treatment no satisfactorily response is noted, the dose may be 
increased to 120 µg/kg/day.  
In the conducted studies, it has also been observed, that not all PFIC1 and PFIC2 patients had a similar 
efficacy response. This may be attributed to the residual protein functionality of the specific membrane 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 139/182 
 
 
 
protein (e.g. BSEP1, BSEP2 and BSEP3). Two patients in study 008 received SBD due to disease 
progression despite odevixibat treatment. Therefore, a warning is included in the SmPC that patients 
should be monitored and if the disease progresses or efficacy is not optimal after 6 months of 
continued odevixibat treatment, other approaches should be considered. It is also stated that some 
conditions or medications that impair either GI motility or enterohepatic circulation of bile acids have 
the potential to reduce the efficacy of odevixibat. 
The observed reductions in pruritus are considered clinically relevant to the patients, as this is the 
most important debilitating symptom of the disease, and an important reason for SBD or OLT. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that sufficient evidence is available to demonstrate that under 
continued odevixibat treatment, patients start to catch-up on growth towards normal healthy peer 
values, which is considered beneficial and contributes to the benefit of treatment. Similar results are 
also observed after SBD or OLT in clinical practice. Liver histopathology and hepatic biochemistry were 
considered exploratory endpoints in the studies. The data suggest that under continued treatment with 
odevixibat hepatic damage is stabilised (or at least delayed) where untreated PFIC patients progress to 
liver fibrosis and ultimately, liver failure requiring liver transplantation.  
Based on literature data, reduction of serum bile acid levels, ASAT, total bilirubin or improvement of 
PELD or MELD is associated with significantly prolonged native liver survival in PFIC1 and PFIC2 
patients. However, it was also indicated that the predictive value of SBAs in PFIC1 and PFIC2 does not 
qualify SBA’s as a surrogate parameter for liver survival. In the clinical studies conducted, the current 
data does not allow to convincingly conclude whether the improvements/stabilisation in liver related 
parameters observed with odevixibat treatment would translate into a delay of surgery (SBD) /OLT. In 
order to provide further solid information on this fact,  
The CHMP considers the following Specific obligation necessary to generate long-term follow up 
efficacy data in the context of an MA under exceptional circumstances: 
• 
Post-authorisation registry-based efficacy study: In order to investigate whether odevixibat 
treatment delays surgical biliary diversion (SBD) and/or liver transplantation (OLT), with 
matched comparison against untreated PFIC patients, the MAH should conduct and submit the 
results of a study based on data from a disease registry of patients aged 6 months or older 
with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) according to an agreed protocol. 
Annual reports are to be submitted as part of the annual reassessment. Feasibility assessment for this 
study are to be submitted within 3 months of EC decision. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The duration of study treatment for the Phase 2 and 3 studies and treatment compliance (Phase 3 
studies only) are provided for the Safety Analysis Set in Table 45 and Table 46, respectively.  
As detailed previously, Study A4250-005 was a 24-week study; eligible patients from this study could 
rollover to the 72-week extension Study A4250-008. For Study A4250-005, the median duration of 
exposure was approximately 24 weeks in all treatment groups, and median treatment compliance was 
high (>90% in all groups).  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 140/182 
 
 
 
 
Across all patients treated with odevixibat in the Pooled Phase 3 group, the median duration of 
exposure as of the 15 July 2020 cut-off was 37.4 weeks and ranged from 1 to 107.9 weeks. Overall, 
29 (38%) of the 77 patients received ≥52 weeks of treatment with odevixibat as of the cut-off date.  
In the 4-week dose-finding study A4250-003, the median duration of exposure was 6.1 weeks and 
ranged from 6 to 13.4 weeks; the exposure durations of >4 weeks are due to 4 patients who received 
a second 4-week treatment course as allowed by the protocol; total exposure duration for these 
patients across both treatment courses are included. Treatment compliance in this study was 96%.

Adverse events 
An overview of TEAE incidence is presented for the Safety Analysis Set in Table 47 (see further below).  
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, 61 (79%) of 77 patients experienced at least 1 TEAE. In Study A4250-
005, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups (84% and 83%, 
respectively) and in the placebo group (85%). The overall incidence of TEAEs for patients with PFIC in 
Study A4250-003, a 4-week uncontrolled Phase 2 study, was 70%.  
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to interruption of study treatment were reported in 17 patients 
(22%) in the Pooled Phase 3 group, mostly related to patients meeting the protocol criteria for 
interruption of study drug. In Study A4250-005, treatment interruptions due to TEAEs were more 
commonly reported among patients who received 120 μg/kg/day (32%) compared with patients who 
received 40 μg/kg/day (13%) or placebo (5%). No treatment interruptions due to TEAEs were reported 
in Study A4250-003.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021

Discontinuation of treatment was reported in 4 patients (5%) in the Pooled Phase 3 group; this 
included 1 patient in the 120 μg/kg/day group during Study A4250-005 and 3 patients during Study 
A4250-008. The TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation in Study A4250-005 (diarrhoea) was 
assessed as drug-related; all other TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported as unrelated to 
odevixibat. 
Treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥ 5% of patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group are presented in

Note: diarrhoea AEs include preferred terms of diarrhoea, diarrhoea haemorrhagic, frequent bowel movements, and 
faeces soft.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 7 
(9%) of the 77 patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group. In Study A4250-005, there were no SAEs 
reported in patients who received 40 μg/kg/day; 3 patients (16%) in the 120 μg/kg/day group and 5 
patients (25%) in the placebo group experienced SAEs. Two (20%) of the patients with PFIC in Study 
A4250-003 experienced SAEs. None of the treatment-emergent SAEs were assessed by the 
investigator as related to study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
No consistent effect was seen on the haematological, coagulation parameters or clinical chemistry. 
None of the observations were clinically significant, no clinically meaningful differences were noted for 
changes from baseline to the last assessment for urine analysis. Analysis of the vital signs and physical 
examination did not reveal clinically relevant changes. ECG were obtained from healthy volunteers (N= 
150), no clinically significant findings were reported, and all QT intervals were ≤ 500 ms. No ECGs 
were collected in the Phase 2 or 3 studies. No patients reported Torsade de pointes or QT prolongation 
as an AE in the phase 2 or 3 studies.

In general, age did not appear to affect the overall observed safety and tolerability profile. Due to the 
imbalance with the number of patients aged 6 to 12 years (N=19) and ≥ 13 years of age (N=5) 
compared to 53 patients ≤ 5 years of age, the subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution.  
The incidence of TEAEs by age in the Pooled Phase 3 group was highest among patients ≤ 5 years of 
age compared with the 6 to 12 years of age and ≥ 13 years of age categories (85% versus 63% and 
80%, respectively). In the age category ≤ 5 years of age, the difference in the incidence of TEAEs was 
primarily observed with a higher incidence in events of vomiting in the GI disorders SOC and in the 
Infections and infestations SOC with a higher incidence of events of upper respiratory tract infection, 
nasopharyngitis, and influenza. Based on medical review, in a number of these patients, the timing of 
the events of vomiting and infections was simultaneous or overlapping and often in conjunction with an 
event of pyrexia.  
Four patients in the age category ≤ 5 years of age experienced a TEAE of jaundice; 2 of the 4 patients 
had an ongoing medical history of jaundice. In general, a higher proportion of patients in age group ≤ 
5 years of age had an ongoing medical history of jaundice compared with patients in the 6 to 12 years 
of age category (26% versus 11%). 
Sex  
The incidence of TEAEs in the Pooled Phase 3 group was slightly higher among male versus female 
patients (84% versus 74%). However, this was not the case for TEAE’s in the GI disorders SOC, where 
the incidence of TEAEs was slightly lower in male patients compared with female patients.  
The incidence of TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was comparable between male and 
female patients (47% and 46%, respectively).  
In the Investigations SOC, TEAEs were most commonly increased hepatic biochemical parameters; the 
following observations are important. Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification) was 
more prominent in male patients compared with female patients, who mainly had mild hepatic 
impairment by Child-Pugh classification. In evaluating the incidence of investigations and hepatic 
TEAEs, it should be noted that male patients had higher baseline ALT and total bilirubin levels 
compared with female patients. More female patients presented with lower baseline ALT and total 
bilirubin levels.  
In male and female patients, the incidence of TEAEs of bilirubin increased was 21% and 10%, 
respectively; ALT increased was 18% and 8%, respectively; and AST increased was 11% and 3%, 
respectively. Treatment-emergent AEs of vitamin D decreased were reported in 8% and 3%, of male 
and female patients, respectively.  
Race  
The incidence of TEAEs in the Pooled Phase 3 group was higher among non-Caucasian patients than 
Caucasian patients (91% versus 77%). However, fewer patients were non- Caucasian than Caucasian 
(N=11 and N=66, respectively), which should be considered when reviewing the observed incidences 
of TEAEs by SOC.  
Ethnicity  
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, 2 patients were Hispanic or Latino in ethnicity. 
Region  
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, most patients (N=42) were enrolled at sites in Europe, followed by the 
RoW (N=24) and the US (N=11). Patients enrolled in the US generally had comparable baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 153/182 
 
 
 
 
disease characteristics to those enrolled in Europe and RoW. It was noted that fewer patients in the US 
were treated with UDCA, rifampicin, or UDCA and/or rifampicin.  
The incidence of TEAEs in Europe (76%) and RoW (88%) was generally similar. In addition, the 
incidence of TEAEs was similar between the European and RoW in the SOCs where events were most 
commonly reported: GI disorders (48% and 46%, respectively), Investigations (43% and 38%, 
respectively), and Infections and infestations (48% and 54%, respectively). The low number of 
patients precludes meaningful subgroup comparisons at the preferred term level between treatment 
groups in Study A4250-005, and by SAEs in Study A4250-005 and in the Pooled Phase 3 group.  
PFIC Type  
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, 20 patients had PFIC1, and 51 patients had PFIC2. The incidence of 
TEAEs by the diagnosis of PFIC1 versus PFIC2 was similar (80% in each). Patients with PFIC1 
compared with PFIC2 had a higher incidence of TEAEs in the most common SOCs of GI disorders (60% 
versus 47%), Infections and infestations (65% versus 45%), and Investigations (50% versus 35%). It 
is notable that all 4 of the patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group with TEAEs of jaundice in the 
Hepatobiliary SOC had PFIC2. In general, the low number of patients with PFIC1 precludes meaningful 
subgroup comparisons by PFIC type at the preferred term level, between treatment groups in Study 
A4250-005, and by SAEs in Study A4250-005 and in the Pooled Phase 3 group. 
Five patients with PFIC3 enrolled in Cohort 2 of Study A4250-008. The medical review revealed no 
clinically meaningful differences in clinical safety laboratory data or reported TEAEs compared with 
PFIC1 or PFIC 2 patients. Three of the 5 patients did trigger criteria for adjudication (hepatic 
biochemical parameters and/or INR increased); all events were adjudicated as related to underlying 
disease. 
Hepatic function 
The incidence of TEAEs by Child-Pugh classification was similar among patients with mild and moderate 
impairment (78% and 82%, respectively). In the most common SOC of GI disorders, the incidence of 
TEAEs was similar among patients with mild and moderate impairment (46% and 48%, respectively). 
However, the incidence of TEAEs was lower among patients with mild versus moderate impairment in 
the SOCs of Infections and infestations (42% versus 56%, respectively) and Investigations (36% and 
48%, respectively). 
A review of preferred terms in the GI disorders SOC for patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group revealed 
diarrhoea was reported in 26% and 7% of patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
respectively. Vomiting was reported in 14% and 15% of patients with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment, respectively. 
Immunological events 
No evaluation and/or studies considering antibody formation were performed. This is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP, as the systemic exposition of odevixibat is very limit an immunologic 
response is not to be expected.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No human drug-drug interaction studies were submitted. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP, 
as the systemic exposition of odevixibat is very limit and systemic drug-drug reaction are not 
expected.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A by-patient listing of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation is provided in Table 51. 
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, 4 (5%) of 77 patients experienced a TEAE leading to study drug 
discontinuation, including 1 patient in the 120 µg/kg/day group in Study A4250-005 and 3 patients in 
Study A4250-008. No patients in the 40 µg/kg/day and placebo groups experienced a TEAE leading to 
study drug discontinuation during Study A4250-005. Two events leading to discontinuation, cholestasis 
in one Patient and acute (on chronic) pancreatitis in another Patient, were severe in intensity, and both 
were reported as SAEs. One patient had an interruption in study drug due to the event of acute 
pancreatitis and subsequently withdrew consent to participate. The only TEAE leading to study drug 
discontinuation that was assessed by the investigator as study drug-related was diarrhoea in one 
patient. Mild to moderate TEAEs of splenomegaly, jaundice, hypophagia, and weight decreased were 
reported in one patient. Except the TEAE of splenomegaly, all TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation were resolved at the time of the data cut-off. No patients discontinued study drug due 
to TEAEs during Study A4250-003.

One Patient in Cohort 2 withdrew consent to participate in the study and the reason for 
discontinuation in the EOT form was consent withdrawal. 
b One Patient in Cohort 2 discontinued treatment due to TEAEs of splenomegaly, hypophagia, and 
weight decrease; however, the EOT form was not completed at the interim cut and therefore this 
patient was considered as ongoing. A query was issued to the site to complete the EOT form.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary evaluation of the safety and tolerability of odevixibat in the proposed indication is based 
on the two Phase 3 studies A4250-005 and A4250-008 (Pooled Phase 3 Group) including a total of 84 
patients with PFIC who received at least 1 dose of odevixibat. Supportive data are provided by the 
Phase 2 study A4250-003 conducted in 20 patients, including 10 patients with PFIC. Given the limited 
number of patients, no robust conclusions on safety can be drawn. Given the limited number of 
patients at the time of authorisation, safety would need to be supported by long-term data. For this 
reason, the final safety report generated by the applicant-initiated extension study (008) is of interest 
and the applicant committed to provide the results by July 2023. The applicant has committed to do so 
and the clinical study is included in the RMP.  
From the 84 patients included in the Pooled Phase 3 Group, 44 (52%) patients received ≥52 weeks 
and 26 (31%) received ≥76 weeks of treatment with odevixibat as of the cut-off date. 
All TEAEs in Study A4250-003 were mild to moderate in severity except for one report of 
gastroenteritis which was severe and reported as an SAE; one other serious event, mild influenza, was 
reported in this study. Both SAEs were assessed as unrelated to study treatment. In the Pooled Phase 
3 group, 71 (84.5%) of 84 patients experienced at least 1 TEAE. In Study A4250-005, the overall 
incidence of TEAEs was similar in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups (84% and 83%, respectively) and 
in the placebo group (85%).  
The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥ 10%) among patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group were 
pyrexia (23 patients, 27.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (20 patients, 23.8%), diarrhoea (17 
patients, 20.2%), blood bilirubin increased (15 patients each, 17.9%), cough (13 patients, 15.5%) 
vomiting (11 patients, 13.1%), ALT increased (13 patients, 15.5%), and pruritus (9 patients, 10.7%). 
Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity and were assessed as unrelated to study treatment. 
Severe TEAEs were reported in 8 (9.5%) of the 84 patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group. 
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, 35 (41.7%) patients experienced a drug related TEAE. The incidence of 
drug-related TEAEs in Study A4250-005 in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups (30% and 37%, 
respectively) was like the Pooled Phase 3 group but was higher among odevixibat-treated patients 
compared with the placebo group in that study (15%). Most drug related TEAEs were mild to moderate 
in intensity. The most common drug related TEAEs in the Pooled Phase 3 group were blood bilirubin 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 156/182 
 
 
 
 
increased (14.3%), ALT increased (10.7%), and AST increased (6.0%). It is however difficult to 
separate whether adverse events are disease-related or drug-related, cholestasis and elevated hepatic 
biochemical parameters, most excursions in ALT, AST, and total bilirubin values were considered 
related to the underlying disease and therefore not included in the SmPC. Additional information of the 
liver function tests in relation to treatment efficacy will be generated via a registry-based safety study 
in order to collect safety data on hepatotoxicity, diarrhoea, fat-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble 
nutrients in patients treated with odevixibat, to which the applicant agreed.  
Furthermore, in toxicology studies in juvenile rats, dose-limiting focal hepatic toxicities (hepatocyte 
necrosis/apoptosis) were observed; This, however, was seen at an exposition 1200 times the 
exposition reported in humans only. As at the lower exposition levels no hepato-toxicity is reported this 
observation is considered not clinically relevant.  
Initially, the applicant proposed to include in the SmPC section 4.8, every adverse event considered 
related by investigators. This approach was not supported. As the cholestasis and elevated hepatic 
biochemical parameters, most excursions in ALT, AST, and total bilirubin values were considered 
related to the underlying disease and these are not included in the SmPC. However, more information 
of the liver function tests in relation to treatment will be generated in the above mentioned registry.  
Special attention is given for some adverse events that are to be expected based on the 
pharmacodynamic effects of the product. 
Diarrhoea, (including diarrhoea, diarrhoea haemorrhagic, frequent bowel movements) were one of the 
most common TEAEs in patients treated with odevixibat, occurring in 18 (23%) of 77 patients in the 
Pooled Phase 3 group. In Study A4250-005, these diarrhoea events occurred in 39% and 21% of 
patients in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups, respectively, and in 5% of patients in the placebo group. 
Given the limited safety database and the seriousness of the diarrhoea (some intervention appears to 
be necessary), further information on this adverse event will be generated in post-marketing setting, 
as stated earlier. Furthermore, about 13% of the patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group had TEAEs of 
fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, including 3 (16%) patients in the 120 μg/kg/day group during Study 
A4250-005. No patients in the Study A4250-005 40 μg/kg/day group had a TEAE of fat-soluble vitamin 
deficiency. In the majority of these patients, the deficiencies were transient or not considered clinically 
relevant by the investigators. Most of the patients were receiving vitamin therapy at study entry, either 
as a treatment for vitamin deficiency or supplements. Most deficiencies resolved without further 
intervention. Although the occurrence of deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (e.g. vitamins A, D, E, K) 
might be related to both the treatment as the underlying disease, this is not considered an important 
issue, as in clinical practice these patients are regularly evaluated and if necessary supplemented. 
Possible interactions with fat-soluble drugs were identified as a concern. As absorption of fat-soluble 
drugs might be changed and might change over time (modulation of receptors and/or intracellular 
pathway, changes in disease activity due to the drug) more information on the long-term interaction 
with lipophile drugs is considered necessary and will therefore also be collected in the above mentioned 
registry based safety study. 
In order to conduct the above mentioned registry based safety study, the applicant agreed to set up a 
disease registry in order to gather data on the natural history of the disease, treatment efficacy, 
safety, including long-term outcomes, pregnancy, breastfeeding and new-borns in patients with PFIC. 
In particular, there is currently no data on the use of odevixibat in pregnancy. As animal studies have 
indicated possible reproductive toxicity, the embryofoetal toxity risk to newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Hence, data on pregnancy, breastfeading and new-borns is to be collected. These will be 
reviewed on an on-going basis as a part of signal detection and reported within PSURs. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in nine (10.7%) of the patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group. 
In Study A4250-005, there were no SAEs reported in patients who received 40 μg/kg/day; three 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 157/182 
 
 
 
patients (16%) in the 120 μg/kg/day group and five (25%) in the placebo group experienced SAEs. 
Two (20%) of the patients with PFIC in Study A4350-003 experienced SAEs. None of the treatment-
emergent SAEs was assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. 
The dose finding study A4250-005 suggests that there are slightly more adverse events in the higher 
dose group compared to the 40 μg/kg/day. These differences are not unexpected (more adverse 
events in the higher dose) and not considered clinically relevant.  
There were no deaths in the Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies. No clear and consistent effect was seen on the 
haematological, coagulation parameters or clinical chemistry. None of the observation was clinically 
significant. No clinically meaningful differences were noted for changes from baseline to the last 
assessment for urine analysis. Analysis of the vital signs and physical examination did not reveal 
clinically relevant changes. ECGs were obtained from healthy volunteers (N= 150) no clinically 
significant findings were reports and all QT intervals were ≤ 500 ms. No ECGs were collected in the 
Phase 2 or 3 studies. Furthermore, no patients reported Torsade de pointes or QT prolongation as an 
AE in the phase 2 or 3 studies. No clear and consistent difference in the safety profile between the 40 
and 120 μg/kg/day could be identified, although it should be taken in mind that this is based on 23 and 
19 patients, respectively. Age or gender did not appear to affect the overall observed safety and 
tolerability profile. The analysis of race and ethnicity were hampered by the low number of non-
Caucasian patients. Patients with PFIC1 compared with PFIC2 had a higher incidence of TEAEs in the 
most common SOCs of GI disorders (55% versus 46%), Infections and infestations (59% versus 
48%), and Investigations (59% versus 38%). Treatment-emergent AEs leading to interruption of study 
treatment were reported in 21 patients (25%) in the Pooled Phase 3 group, mostly related to patients 
meeting the protocol criteria for interruption of study drug. Discontinuation of treatment was reported 
in five patients (6%) in the Pooled Phase 3 group, this included one patient in the 120 μg/kg/day group 
and four patients during the extension phase (120 μg/kg/day). The TEAE leading to treatment 
discontinuation (diarrhoea) was assessed as drug-related; all other TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
were reported as unrelated to odevixibat.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
As expected in a rare disease setting, the safety database is limited and does not allow for robust 
conclusions. Therefore, safety would need to be supported by long-term data. The final safety report of 
the ongoing Study A4250-008 should be submitted upon completion and this commitment is also 
reflected in the RMP. Furthermore, additional information of the adverse events will be collected via a 
registry based safety study; special attention should be paid to the uptake of fat-soluble food 
components (among others Vit A, D, E, K) and interactions with fat-soluble medicinal products, 
hepatotoxicity, and diarrhoea, in patients treated with odevixibat 
The safety profile from the limited data available is considered acceptable. Although the safety 
database is considered limited at the time of approval, additional safety data will be collected in the 
post-authorisation phase.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data: 
• 
The final safety report generated by the ongoing extension study A4250-008 should be 
submitted upon completion in 2023.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.6 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Bylvay is a new active substance  and the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list 
for Bylvay is needed. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this 
medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not 
request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list 
entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of odevixibat with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers odevixibat to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
Not applicable.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Bylvay (odevixibat) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Odevixibat is indicated for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in 
patients aged 6 months or older. Odevixibat is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it 
binds reversibly to IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids into the liver, increasing the clearance 
of bile acids through the colon and lowering hepatic bile acid load and serum bile acids. By inhibiting 
the IBAT with high selectivity and potency, odevixibat has the potential to reduce the systemic 
accumulation of bile acids that result from cholestasis, relieve pruritus, improve liver function, and 
modify the progression of liver damage in patients with PFIC without surgical intervention. PFIC is a 
rare disease estimated to affect one in every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide. PFIC is 
generally categorised into 3 main subtypes, PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC3, although at least 3 other 
subtypes have been described in the literature. Each PFIC type is based on a different mutation, 
leading to disruption of specific membrane transporter proteins in the hepatocyte to enterocyte 
involved in shuttling bile acids (BAs) from the hepatocyte to the ileum. Due to accumulation of BAs 
hepatoxic concentrations are reached, leading to severe pruritus, growth retardation and ultimately 
cirrhosis. PFIC2 is considered the most severe form of the disease with rapid progression in early 
childhood (neonatal onset). The prognosis is poor; many PFIC patients progress to end-stage liver 
disease and require liver transplantation. Performing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) or biliary 
diversion surgery (SBD) is also one of the major reasons to cope with the burden of intractable 
pruritus in these patients. Survival in patients with PFIC not undergoing surgical biliary diversion or 
liver transplant is 50% at 10 years of age and <10% at 20 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no medicinal product approved for use in treatment of PFIC1 and PFIC2. The 
therapeutic choices are restricted to non-specific therapy of the clinical symptoms and signs of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 170/182 
 
 
 
disease such as nutritional support, prevention of vitamin deficiencies, and symptomatic treatment of 
extrahepatic features, including pruritus. Medical treatment options include off-label use of 
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), rifampicin, hydroxyzine, antihistamines, and naltrexone, but none of 
these therapies have proven benefits for the long-term prognosis of patients with PFIC. For PFIC3 
UDCA is registered in France only. As symptomatic medical treatment is rarely effective, surgical 
options are considered, including biliary diversion (such as partial external biliary diversion [PEBD] or 
ileal exclusion) and liver transplantation. Treatment-resistant pruritus is the leading indication for 
surgical biliary diversion, particularly in patients with PFIC2 where it is listed as an indication for 
surgery in 89% of patients. Continued elevated serum bile acids and pruritus are also seen in some 
patients after biliary diversion surgery. While biliary diversion surgery may postpone or eliminate the 
need for liver transplantation and improve pruritus associated with PFIC in some patients, it is an 
invasive procedure. Although liver transplantation may resolve cholestasis in patients with PFIC1 and 
PFIC2, the overall outcome remains unsatisfactory in many patients with PFIC1; this is mainly due to 
extrahepatic manifestations, organ rejection, and the complications and the risks associated with 
chronic immune-suppressant therapy. Therefore, there is a clear unmet medical need, in which 
odevixibat might prove to be a suitable option. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted the pivotal double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study 
(study 005), in addition to the open-label extension study (study 008) to evaluate long term efficacy 
and safety of odevixibat in children with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis types 1 and 2 
(study 005) and PFIC types 1 to 3 and PFIC 6 (or MyoB5) (study 008).  
Study 005 included 62 paediatric patients with PFIC 1 (n=17) or PFIC 2 (n=45). The median age was 
3.2 years (min, max 0.5, 15.9 years). Among the PFIC 2 patients, 12 patients were BSEP1 and 33 
patients were BSEP2. Patients were randomised to odevixibat 40 µg/kg/day (n=23), 120 µg/kg/day 
(n=19) or placebo (n=20). Treatment was 24 weeks after which patients could enrol in the open-label 
follow-up study 008. If in study 005 patients had tolerability issues or lack of efficacy after a minimal 
treatment period of 12 weeks, they could be switched over to study 008 (e.g. “the early roll over” 
patients) were they were treated with odevixibat 120 µg/kg/day. Three of 62 patients in study 005 
were previously treated in the dose finding study 003; the patients were randomised to each study 
arm. 
The dosages used in the pivotal study were based on the dose-finding study 003. The in- and exclusion 
criteria are appropriate to select the relevant paediatric patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2 with some 
functionality of the BSEP protein.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing at least a 70% reduction in 
fasting serum bile acids (SBAs) concentration from baseline to the end of treatment or reaching a level 
≤70 μmol/L (28.6 μg/mL) after 24 weeks of treatment. The important secondary endpoint was the 
proportion of positive pruritus assessments for AM and PM scores combined at the patient level over 
the 24-week treatment period based on the Albireo ObsRO instrument. Further, the applicant was 
advised to submit an analysis of the number (%) of patients achieving a positive pruritus assessment 
(AM and PM Scores Combined) for more than 50% of the time during the 24-week treatment period. In 
addition, liver-related parameters (e.g. MELD/PELD, APRI, FIB-4 score, Fibroscan) were measured that 
may support a delay in fibrosis development and delaying SBD or OLT.  
In the ongoing study 008, as of the data cut-off of 4 December 2020, all patients received odevixibat 
120 µg/kg/day, which was decided based on (pre)clinical data prior to unblinding study 005. Dose 
lowering to 40 µg/kg/day was allowed in case of tolerability issues. The study consists of two cohorts. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 171/182 
 
 
 
Cohort 1 includes all patients previously treated in study 005 (40 µg/kg/day (n=21); 120 µg/kg/day 
(n= 16) and placebo (n= 19)), and cohort 2 includes treatment naïve patients (n=23). Cohort 2 
includes 5 patients with PFIC1, 12 with PFIC2, 5 with PFIC3 and 1 patient with PFIC6. The endpoints in 
study 008 are similar to study 005. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 005 
Reduction of serum bile acids: The primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients experiencing at 
least a 70% reduction in serum bile acids concentration from baseline to the end of treatment or 
reaching a level ≤70 μmol/L (28.6 μg/mL) after 24 weeks of treatment, was met. In the FAS, 10/23 
patients (43.5%) and 4/19 patients (21.1%) in the odevixibat 40 μg/kg/day and odevixibat 120 
μg/kg/day respectively responded to treatment. There were no responders (0/20 patients) in the 
placebo group.  
Reduction of pruritus: The proportion of positive pruritus assessments (night-time (AM) and day-time 
(PM) values combined) at the patient level over the 24-week treatment was as follows: LS Mean 
Difference (SE) (odevixibat – placebo): 28.23 (9.182) and 21.71 (9.892) for the 40 μg/kg and 120 
μg/kg respectively. No major differences were observed between the AM as the PM results separately. 
The CHMP also requested to demonstrate the proportion of patients achieving a positive pruritus 
assessment for >50% of the 24-week treatment period. The proportion was 61.9% for the overall 
odevixibat group, including 73.9% and 47.4% of patients in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups, 
respectively, compared with 20.0% for the placebo group. 
Changes in liver pathology and liver biochemistry: The mean changes from baseline to week 24 in 
PELD/MELD scores were -2.43 and -1.10 in the odevixibat 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups, respectively, 
compared with -0.66 in the placebo group. In line with the PELD/MELD score, the APRI and FIB-4 score 
also showed marginal improvements in changes from baseline to week 24.  
Growth: The mean (SE) change from baseline to Week 24 in height z-score were -0.16 (0.104), 0.05 
(0.105) and 0.00 (0.163) for placebo, 40 μg/kg/day and 120 μg/kg/day, respectively.  
Study 008 
Reduction of serum bile acids: For patients in Cohort 1 of study 008 the mean (SE) changes in serum 
bile acids levels from study 005 baseline to Week 22/24 were -160.7 µmol/L (41.4), a decrease of 
64.0% for those patients who had received 40 µg/kg/day in study 005, -150.6µmol/L (58.2), a 
decrease of 50.4 %, in patients who had previous received 120 µg/kg/day. For patients who had 
received placebo in study 005, mean change with odevixibat 120 µg/kg/day was -156.4 µmol/L (33.7 
), a decrease of 58.1%, and for 14/23 the treatment naïve patients in Cohort 2 the change was -
65.3µmol/L (28.4), a decrease of 30.4%.  
Reduction of pruritus: After 24 weeks of treatment in study 008 the mean (SE) proportion of positive 
pruritus assessments in patients who previously received 40 μg/kg/day (n=21) was 39.6% (8.7), and 
27.4% (7.0) for patients who had received 120 μg/kg/day (n=16). For the patients) previously on 
placebo (n=19) this was 59.3% (9.2). For the naïve patients in Cohort 2 (n=11) the proportion was 
78.4 (9.9). 
Changes in liver pathology and biochemistry: The baseline values for PELD/MELD, APRI and FIB-4 
scores were all indicative for patients not likely to have fibrosis or have minimal fibrosis (e.g. 
PELD/MELD values negative; APRI scores <0.5 and FIB-4 <3.25). For PELD/MELD the mean (SE) 
changes from baseline study 008 to Week 24 were 0.29 (0.45) and -0.41 (0.30) in patients who had 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 172/182 
 
 
 
received 40 μg/kg/day or 120 μg/kg/day in study 005. For patients who had received placebo in study 
005 this was -1.41 (0.87). For the patients in cohort 2 (n=11) the change was 2.28 (1.50). 
Marginal improvements were observed under continued odevixibat treatment in study 008 in patients 
previously treated with odevixibat in study 005. Only for 10 patients fibroscan data were available; the 
data indicates some improvement in fibrosis.  
Growth: For patients in Cohort 1 who had previously received odevixibat in study 005, mean (SE) 
change from baseline to Week 48 in study 008 in height z-score were 0.55 (0.21), 0.35 (0.20) 40 
μg/kg/day and 120 μg/kg/day, respectively. For patients in Cohort 1 who had received placebo and in 
Cohort 2 patients, mean (SE) changes in height z-score were 0.75 (0.21), and 0.14 (0.22), 
respectively.  
Other endpoints: For both studies the other clinical secondary and exploratory efficacy results were 
consistent and pointed in the same direction for improvement under odevixibat treatment. 
Choice of starting dose: Post hoc analyses to compare the results for the primary analyses of pruritus 
and serum bile acids across the 40 and 120 µg/kg/day groups showed that there was no statistically 
significant difference between the two odevixibat dose groups for the proportion of positive pruritus 
assessments at the patient level over the 24-week treatment period (2-sided p-value = 0.5008) or in 
the proportion of serum bile acid responders (2-sided p-value = 0.1083). Based on additional 
comparison of clinical data in patients switching from 40 (n=20) to 120 µg/kg/day and those initiated 
and maintained on 120 µg/kg/day shows that 40 µg/kg/day is the most appropriate starting dose, as 
reflected in the SmPC. Of the nine patients who did not respond to 40 µg/kg/day, four additional 
patients responded when switched to 120 µg/kg/day. This is reflected in the SmPC since dose 
escalation can be considered in case of inadequate after 3 months of treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study 008: Only 11 of 23 patients in study 008 cohort 2 had data available at Week 22/24 at the time 
of the data cut-off. One patient required surgical biliary diversion, and one patient received liver 
transplantation due to lack of improvement in pruritus. There is limited data on the long term use of 
odevixibat. The applicant has committed to submit final results for Study 008 by July 2023. 
Changes in liver pathology and biochemistry: For the changes in liver pathology and biochemistry only 
about one year of follow-up data in a limited number of patients is available (i.e. short-term). 
Hepatotoxicity is an important potential risk and is included in the RMP. 
Delay in SBD/OLT: There is currently no direct evidence that odevixibat is delaying SBD and or OLT, as 
discussed in section 3.7.3. 
Hepatic impairment: Patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction were recruited to the clinical 
programme, whereas no patients with severe hepatic impairment were recruited. The absence of 
clinical data in patients with severe hepatic impairment is stated in the SmPC SmPC with 
recommendation for additional monitoring for adverse reactions when odevixibat is administered to 
these patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
From the 84 PFIC patients included in the Pooled Phase 3 group (study 005 and 008 combined), 44 
(52%) of the 84 patients received ≥52 weeks and 26 (31%) received ≥76 weeks of treatment with 
odevixibat as of the cut-off date (04 December 2020).  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021  
Page 173/182 
 
 
 
In the Pooled Phase 3 group, 35 (41.7%) patients experienced a drug-related TEAE. The incidence of 
drug-related TEAEs in Study 005 in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups (30% and 37%, respectively) 
was similar to the Pooled Phase 3 group but was higher among odevixibat-treated patients compared 
with the placebo group in that study (15%). Most drug-related TEAEs were mild to moderate in 
intensity. The most common drug-related TEAEs in the Pooled Phase 3 group were blood bilirubin 
increased (14.3%), ALT increased (10.7%), and AST increased (6.0%).  
Adverse event of special interest: Diarrhoea, (including diarrhoea, diarrhoea haemorrhagic, frequent 
bowel movements and faeces soft) were one of the most common TEAEs in patients treated with 
odevixibat, occurring in 18 (21.4%) of 84 patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group. In Study 005, these 
diarrhoea events occurred in 39% and 21% of patients in the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day groups, 
respectively, and in 5% of patients in the placebo group.  
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 9 (10.7%) of the 84 patients in the Pooled Phase 3 group. 
In Study A4250-005, there were no SAEs reported in patients who received 40 μg/kg/day; 3 patients 
(16%) in the 120 μg/kg/day group and 5 (25%) in the placebo group experienced SAEs. Two (20%) of 
the patients with PFIC in Study A4350-003 experienced SAEs. None of the treatment-emergent SAEs 
were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. There were no deaths in the Phase 2 or 
Phase 3 studies.  
Analysis of the vital signs and physical examination did not reveal clinically relevant changes. ECGs 
were obtained from healthy volunteers (N= 150) no clinically significant findings were reports, and all 
QT intervals were ≤500 ms. Further, no patients reported Torsade de Pointes or QT prolongation as an 
AE in the phase 2 or 3 studies. 
Age nor gender appeared to affect the overall observed safety and tolerability profile.  
The incidence of TEAEs in Europe (76%) and RoW (88%) was generally similar. 
Patients with PFIC1 compared with PFIC2 had a higher incidence of TEAEs in the most common SOCs 
of GI disorders (60% versus 47%).  
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to interruption of study treatment were reported in 21 patients 
(25%) in the Pooled Phase 3 group. Discontinuation of treatment was reported in five patients (6%) in 
the Pooled Phase 3 group, this included 1 patient in the 120 μg/kg/day group and four patients during 
the extension phase (120 μg/kg/day). The TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation (diarrhoea) was 
assessed as drug-related; all other TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported as unrelated to 
odevixibat. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The primary evaluation of the safety and tolerability of odevixibat in the proposed indication is based on 
the two Phase 3 studies 005 and 008 (Pooled Phase 3 Group) including a total of 84 patients with PFIC. 
Given the limited number of patients at the time of authorisation, safety would need to be supported by 
long-term data. For this reason, the final safety report generated by the applicant-initiated extension 
study (008) is of interest and the applicant committed to provide the results by July 2023.   
From the 84 patients included in the Pooled Phase 3 Group, 44 (52%) patients received ≥52 weeks 
and 26 (31%) received ≥76 weeks of treatment with odevixibat as of the cut-off date (04 December 
2020). The follow-up is considered too short to assess the long-term safety profile (among others 
genotoxicity).  
As  the  underlying  disease  is  only  insufficiently  managed  with  other  treatment  options,  the  signs  and 
symptoms of the disease may obscure the adverse events profile of odevixibat. From a pharmacodynamic 
Assessment report

point of view, various GI-tract adverse events could be expected (e.g. cganges of liver function tests 
and/or increased diarrhoea). The lack of safety data considering clinically significant or severe diarrhoea 
is  considered  a  risk  for  patients  treated  with  odevixibat.  Further,  follow-up  to  learn  more  about  the 
frequency, seriousness, and best treatment options is considered necessary. Hence, the CHMP was of 
the  opinion  that  further,  more  in-depth  safety  related  information  should  be  collected,  especially  on 
diarrhoea, hepatotoxicity and liver function related measures, fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. Thus, 
the CHMP requested a post-authorisation registry study that will monitor these parameters. 
In toxicology studies with juvenile rats, dose-limiting focal hepatic toxicities (hepatocyte 
necrosis/apoptosis) were observed. This, however, was seen at an exposure 1200 times the exposure 
reported in humans. As at the lower exposure levels, no hepatotoxicity is reported and thus, this 
observation is considered not clinically relevant. 
Except for a slightly higher frequency of the adverse events in the higher dose group 120 μg/kg/day 
group, no clear and consistent differences in the safety profile between the 40 and 120 μg/kg/day 
could be identified. It should be kept in mind that this conclusion is based on 23 and 19 patients, 
respectively. 
No ECGs were collected in the Phase 2 or 3 studies. No patients reported Torsade de pointes or QT 
prolongation as an AE in the phase 2 or 3 studies. ECGs were obtained from healthy volunteers. No 
clinically significant findings were reports, and all QT intervals were ≤ 500 ms.  
The non-clinical studies indicate that odevixibat may be teratogenic at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, adequate contraception is required in the treated patients. As no interaction 
study with oral hormonal contraception were conducted, it cannot be excluded that the absorption of 
oral contraceptives is affected by concomitant use of odevixibat (progestogens and ethinyl oestradiol 
are lipophilic substances, and entero-hepatic recirculation plays a role). Therefore, an interaction study 
with an oral hormonal contraceptive will be conducted, as requested by the CHMP, and the final study 
report is awaited by end of 2022.  
In addition to this study, it is anticipated that patients treated with odevixibat will reach sexual 
maturity and given the potentially teratogenic effect of odevixibat, the applicant was requested by the 
CHMP to initiate a disease registry with the focus on documentation of the natural history of the 
disease, treatment efficacy, safety, including long-term outcomes, pregnancy, breastfeeding and new-
borns in patients with PFIC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoint, the reduction of SBAs (a key pathological index of the disease) under continued 
odevixibat treatment has been demonstrated. Accumulation of SBAs in hepatocytes would lead to 
hepatic damage such as fibrosis, portal hypertension and finally cirrhosis. In a literature review, SBA 
levels of 25 to 35 ULN were reported in PFIC patients. After initiation of odevixibat treatment, rapid 
reduction of SBAs is observed. These are considered clinically relevant and they are in the same 
magnitude of SBAs reduction in patients after surgical biliary diversion. 
The reductions in SBAs under odevixibat treatment were accompanied by clinically relevant reductions 
of pruritus (one of the main determinants of patient quality of life outcomes) in most patients. Other 
secondary endpoints such as sleep-related parameters all were consistent with and pointed in the 
same direction as the reduction of pruritus.  
Treatment with odevixibat also led to a clinically relevant improvement in growth over time, indicating 
catch-up growth. The observed growth catch-up is comparable to the effects observed following 
surgical intervention (i.e. 1-year data post-biliary diversion surgery or liver transplantation). The 
results in growth catch-up are supportive for a disease-modifying indication. 
Data on the exploratory hepatic endpoints (ASAT, ALAT, bilirubin, FIB-4, APRI, MELD/PELD) are 
suggestive for improvement or disease stabilisation. Further it is recognised that at data cut-off (4 
December 2020) none of the patients – in whom odevixibat resulted in decrease of sBA or ASAT 
improvement of MELD/PELD or pruritis - was listed for transplant, contrary to the patients who failed 
on odevixibat of whom 2 patients underwent surgery. Further, measurements on hepatic and fibrosis 
parameters and limited data on fibroscans were presented. In general, a trend toward improvement 
was observed for the aforementioned measures. This, however, only applied to a very limited number 
of patients. Although these data are encouraging and all point in the direction of improvement of liver 
health, only data for about short-term follow-up is available. Long-term follow-up data to confirm 
stabilisation or improvement on the hepatic parameters is not available. In addition, there is no direct 
evidence that odevixibat treatment will delay SBD and/or OLT. Therefore, the data on hepatic 
parameters cannot be extrapolated and more data is to be collected in a post-marketing setting. For 
this reason, a registry-based efficacy study will be conducted, as a specific obligation, in order to 
investigate whether odevixibat delays surgery and/or OLT in the context of a marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances.  The variables that are required to address this question will be 
recorded in a registry (database). The general outline of the registry and the registry-based study 
protocol as provided by the applicant to date, are agreeable to the CHMP. Feasibility assessment for 
this study will be submitted within 3 months of EC decision. 
In the clinical studies, only 5 patients with PFIC3 and 1 patient with MyoB5 mutation (i.e. PFIC6) were 
included (long term follow-up study cohort 2). Albeit the very limited data available for these patients 
in cohort 2, the applicant has extensively substantiated that extrapolation to a broad PFIC population is 
justified. Although it has to be acknowledged that the pathomechanisms of various subtypes of PFIC 
differ considerably, extrapolation is based on: 1) the fact that odevixibat inhibits the IBAT receptor 
which is universally shared in all PFIC patients, 2) discussion on potential limitations for extrapolation 
as mentioned in the Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for 
paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) and 3) the observed clinical relevant reductions in pruritus in all 
studied PFIC types, provided some residual function of the various transporters in the hepatocyte 
exists. Therefore, a general indication in PFIC can be supported. Only 2 patients over 18 years of age 
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021 
Page 178/182 
 
 
 
were included. Although the data is limited, it is expected that there is no difference in treatment effect 
based on the mode of action of odevixibat. Based on the extrapolation, the clear and clinically relevant 
improvements on the reduction of pruritus, SBAs and growth catch-up, and the short-term 
improvements on hepatic parameters, an indication for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged 6 
months and older under exceptional circumstances is acceptable to the CHMP. 
On the other hand, based on the safety findings (e.g. hepatic-associated events), it is observed that 
the reported hepatic-associated events are not necessary drug-induced but are probably the results of 
underlying disease. Therefore, these safety findings are not mentioned in the SmPC as AE. 
The primary evaluation of safety is based on a total of 84 patients with PFIC. Given the limited number 
of patients, no robust conclusions on safety can be drawn. For this reason, the final safety report 
generated by the extension study 008 is of interest and will be provided to the CHMP. Also, more 
information on hepatic safety is considered necessary, especially data on fat-soluble drug and food 
components, which will be generated in a dedicated registry-based safety study. Diarrhoea (including 
diarrhoea, diarrhoea haemorrhagic, frequent bowel movements and faeces soft) were one of the most 
common drug-related AEs in patients treated with odevixibat. Diarrhoea may also lead to dehydration. 
Further, follow-up to on these events about the frequency, seriousness, and best treatment options is 
expected to be derived from this safety study. 
The non-clinical studies indicated that odevixibat may be teratogenic at clinically relevant 
concentrations. As no interaction study with oral hormonal contraception has been conducted, it is 
currently unknown whether oral hormonal contraception can be safely used as a contraception method. 
This will be investigated post-marketing. The adequate use of contraception is sufficiently addressed in 
the SmPC with a recommendation to use a barrier contraceptive method. In addition, due to the 
potential teratogenic character of odevixibat pregnancies outcomes and follow-up of new-borns will be 
conducted in this disease registry. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
During odevixibat treatment, a significant reduction in serum bile acids accompanied by a significant 
reduction in pruritus was seen. Furthermore, patients started to catch up on their growth. Hepatic 
parameters and fibrosis scores were improving or were stable for the duration of the study (max. 72 
weeks). The short-term data indicate the potency of odevixibat to delay disease progression and the 
need for surgery and/or OLT. As no direct evidence is available that odevixibat treatment will delay 
SBD and/or OLT, the provided data are lacking for a comprehensive demonstration of efficacy with 
clinical outcomes. To address this, a registry-based efficacy study will be conducted as a specific 
obligation in the post-marketing setting. Additional safety data pertaining to the severity of diarrhoea 
and fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients, together with pregnancy outcomes and follow-up of new-borns 
is to be collected post-approval. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As comprehensive data on the delay of surgical biliary diversion and liver transplantation on the 
product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances was requested 
by the applicant on the basis that it is unlikely that the Applicant will be able to provide comprehensive 
efficacy data due to rarity of the indication. The CHMP agrees that due to the very rare prevalence of 
the disease, it is not expected that comprehensive efficacy data will be generated on the delay of 
surgical biliary diversion and/or liver transplantation within a reasonable time frame.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319560/2021 
Page 179/182 
 
 
 
Although there is a suggestion that hepatic parameters showed some improvement (or at least some 
stabilisation) under continued odevixibat treatment, the current data do not allow full extrapolation of 
these observations to a delay in biliary surgery and/or OLT. The results were based on a placebo-
controlled study; however, this study was considered to cover only short time period to draw any firm 
conclusions. As long-term data is lacking, the CHMP considered that additional efficacy data is required 
to investigate whether odevixibat indeed delays biliary surgery and/or OLT. The collection of these 
data, which is also based on recruitment rate of PFIC patients, is necessary and it will take a long time 
given the rarity of the disease. At the time of approval, it is not possible to establish a comprehensive 
clinical database based on clinical trial data to determine the long-term beneficial effect on liver 
survival (delay of SBD/OLT). PFIC is an orphan disease and robust confirmation of delay of relevant 
clinical outcome parameters like SBD/OLT is challenging, if not unfeasible.  The clinical treatment 
pathway is very heterogeneous, dependent on healthcare professionals’ preferences, and often also 
complicated by the additional conditions. Taken together, it can be concluded that the applicant cannot 
be reasonably expected to provide comprehensive indisputable evidence for the long-term clinical 
benefit. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the collection of further data on long-term benefit should 
be conducted as part of an imposed specific obligation within a framework of an authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances. 
Further, as it is anticipated that patients treated with odevixibat will reach sexual maturity and given 
the potentially teratogenic effect of odevixibat, the CHMP requested the applicant to initiate a disease 
registry, to collect data on the use during pregnancy, breastfeeding and in new-borns. These data on 
pregnancy should be investigated as a post-marketing measure. The CHMP also considered that 
additional safety data are necessary on the effect of odevixibat treatment on diarrhoea, hepatotoxicity 
and the effect on fat-soluble nutrients and drugs. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate, with the following specific obligation:  
• 
Post-authorisation registry-based efficacy study: In order to investigate whether odevixibat 
treatment delays surgical biliary diversion (SBD) and/or liver transplantation (OLT), with 
matched comparison against untreated PFIC patients, the MAH should conduct and submit the 
results of a study based on data from a disease registry of patients aged 6 months or older 
with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) according to an agreed protocol. 
Annual interim reports are to be submitted along with the annual reassessments. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy under normal conditions of use, because the applied for indication 
is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive 
evidence. Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is 
considered appropriate.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Bylvay is favourable in the following indication: 
Bylvay is indicated for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients 
aged 6 months or older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the

(EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Post-authorisation registry-based efficacy study: In order to investigate whether 
odevixibat treatment delays surgical biliary diversion (SBD) and/or liver 
transplantation (OLT), with matched comparison against untreated PFIC patients, the 
MAH should conduct and submit the results of a study based on data from a disease 
registry of patients aged 6 months or older with progressive familial intrahepatic

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that odevixibat is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (P/0377/2020) and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

1.  Introduction 
On 20 April 2016, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric studies for Exjade®, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that this study is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Exjade is brand name for  deferasirox presented as  dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 
and 500mg. The investigational drug was available as tablets at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg 
and  500  mg,  packaged  in  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  with  an  induction  seal  and  child 
resistant closure. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The orally active, tridentate iron chelator deferasirox (company research code: ICL670) is the active 
ingredient in Exjade® dispersible tablets. Exjade is currently approved in over 100 countries. In the 
European Union, it was approved on 28-Aug-2006 for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to 
frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta 
thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
-  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  beta  thalassaemia  major  with  iron  overload  due  to 
infrequent  blood  transfusions  (<7  ml/kg/month  of  packed  red  blood  cells)  aged  2  years  and 
older, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Since 20 December 2012, Exjade has been also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload 
requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 10 
years and older with nontransfusion- dependent thalassaemia syndromes. 
The MAH submitted the final report for this clinical study and a clinical overview of this study.  
The MAH submitted one final report for:

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CICL670ATR04:  A  phase  II,  multi-center,  single-arm,  prospective  study  to 
evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  deferasirox  in  beta-thalassemia  major 
patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
Description 
This  is  a  phase  II,  multi-center,  single-arm,  prospective  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
deferasirox  in  beta  thalassemia  major  patients  after  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT). 
The study was conducted in 9 study centers in Turkey. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives: 
The primary objective of the present study was to determine the safety; incidence, type and severity of 
adverse events including renal, hepatic, biochemistry and hematologic parameters of deferasirox in the 
treatment of iron overload after HSCT in patients with betathalassemia major in 12 months period.  
Secondary objectives: 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the change in serum ferritin level from baseline to 12th month 
To evaluate the change in the further parameters of iron overload (cardiac iron and liver iron 
concentration by MR examination) from baseline to 12th month 
To determine the percentage of patients reaching serum ferritin levels lower than 500 μg/L at week 
28 and week 52 
Study design 
This  study  is  a  prospective,  single-arm,  multi-center,  local,  phase  II  clinical  study.  The  patients 
received oral deferasirox at an initial dose of 10 mg/kg/day and dose escalation was allowed up to 20 
mg/kg  daily  for  12  months  or  until  the  serum  ferritin  level  was  below  500  μg/L.  Dose  titration  was 
allowed in 3 months periods by 5 mg/kg/day at the discretion of the investigator unless any AE’s were 
observed,  which  may  create  additional  risk  to  the  patient.  During  the  12  months  treatment  period, 
patients were evaluated every 28 days. After the completion of the study, patients were treated at the 
physician’s discretion with the current best treatment options. The study started on 19-Sep-2013 and 
completed  on  21-Oct-2015  (last  patient  last  visit).  The  study  was  conducted  in  9  study  centers  in 
Turkey.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Statistical Methods 
Data were analyzed using the PASW 18.0 for Windows program. Descriptive statistics were expressed 
as numbers and percentages for categorical variables and as mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
maximum, lower quartile, upper quartile and median for numerical variables. The variables were 
investigated using visual (histogram, probability plots) and analytical methods (Kolmogorov-
Simirnov/Shapiro-Wilk’s test) to determine whether or not they are normally distributed. Friedman test 
and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were conducted to test whether there is a significant change in the 
serum ferritin level. The Wilcoxon test was performed to test the significance of pairwise differences 
using Bonferonni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. 
The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated for grouped adverse events (defined by MedDRA 
System Organ Class terms). A p value <0.10 was considered statistically significant. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Beta-thalassemia patients between the age of 3 and 17 who had iron overload after HSCT were 
included in the study. The estimated sample size was 30 patients. 
Overall 27 pediatric patients with beta thalassemia after HSCT were screened and 26 patients 
completed the study. One patient was lost to follow-up. 
The mean age (SD) was 9.07 (3.81) years with a range from 3 to 16 years. A higher percentage of 
patients were male (70.4%). All patients were Caucasians. The mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) of 
the patients was 17.03 (2.37) kg/m2 (Table 2-1).

Baseline data 
At baseline, 8 patients (29.6%) had other medical disorders besides the study indication (Table 2-2). 
The mean age (SD) of patients at beta thalassemia diagnosis was 13.19 (18.91) months. The mean 
duration from diagnosis to study entry (SD) was 100.81 (48.59) months and the duration from 
diagnosis to HSCT was 86.45 (49.19 months).

At baseline, 2 patients (7.4%) had T2*(magnetic resonance imaging) MRI < 20 msec and 23 patients 
(85.2%) had R2*MRI≥ 5 mg/g dry weight. 
The mean (SD) serum ferritin concentration was 1766.81 (599.64) ng/mL [Table 14-2 of 
CICL670ATR04 CSR]. Overall, 6 patients (22.2%) were using concomitant medications at baseline 
[Table 12-4 of CICL670ATR04 CSR]. 
Efficacy results 
The  median  serum  ferritin  levels  significantly  decreased  from  1718  ng/mL  to  845.30  ng/mL  from 
baseline to week 52 (p<0.001).

Efficacy  was  also  measured  with  cardiac  iron  and  liver  iron  concentration  by  MRI  examination.  An 
increase  in  median  T2*MRI  range  was  observed,  though  not  significant,  which  was  probably  due  to 
small  sample  size  (p=0.50).  A  significant  decrease  was  measured  in  liver  iron  overload  (p<0.001): 
median R2*MRI change from 8.60 (2.80-43.00) at baseline to 4.10 (0.90-12.50) at week 52. 
Two patients (7.7%) reached serum ferritin levels lower than 500 μg/L at week 28 and 9 (33.3%) at 
week 52.

Taken together, these results indicate that deferasirox is effective in decreasing iron overload in beta-
thalassemia major patients after HSCT. 
Assessor’s comment 
This study was not designed to assess deferasirox efficacy. Efficacy parameters were assessed as 
second objectives. 
The changes in serum ferritin levels were first assessed from baseline to 12th month. Comparison of 
liver iron concentration by MRI examination before and after transplantation should be more relevant 
to assess efficacy as the serum ferritin levels could be higher (effect due ton inflammation) in the first 
year after transplantation. Serum ferritin levels decreased with deferasirox but this effect became 
significant from baseline since Week 20. This effect is sustained until Week 48 but the result should be 
taken with cautions because of the limited number of patients and the high difference between the 
lower and upper bounds of the serum ferritin median range in each patients visit. Finally, a percentage 
of 33.3% of patients reaching serum ferritin levels lower than 500 %g/l at the final evaluation visit 
(Week 52). 
This study failed to demonstrate an improvement of cardiac iron overload (Cardiac MRI: 25.95 vs. 
28.00; p=0.520). However, a decrease of liver iron overload could be observed from baseline to Week 
52 (Liver MRI: 8.6 vs. 4.1; p<0.001). 
In conclusion, data collected in this study allow to document efficacy data of deferasirox in a specific 
pediatric population but should be taken with cautions as only 27 patients were included in this study 
among 9 study centers in Turkey. 
Safety results 
AEs regardless of study-drug relationship were reported in 92.6% of patients. In the patients 
experiencing AEs, the most commonly affected primary SOCs were infections & infestations (51.9%), 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (48.1%), investigations (44.4%), general disorders 
(33.3%) and administration site conditions and gastrointestinal disorders (33.3%).

Overall, 7.5% (10 out of 134) of the AEs were suspected to be drug-related [Table 12-10 of 
CICL670ATR04 CSR]. 
No action was taken in 37.3% of the AEs (50 out of 134). For 4.5% of the AEs, the study drug was 
adjusted or temporarily interrupted and medication was administered following 58.2% of the AEs 
[Table 12-11 of CICL670ATR04 CSR]. 
During the study, 8 AEs were grade 3 (increase in ALT in 3 patients, increase in AST in 2 patients, 
decrease in platelet count in 1 patient, herpes zoster in 1 patient and pneumonia in 1 patient) in 7.9% 
of patients [Table 12-12 of CICL670ATR04 CSR]. 
Time to onset of AEs was analyzed by PT and are presented in Table 12-13 of CICL670ATR04 CSR. 
Increase in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) occurred at a median of 28 and 30 days, respectively, and 
anaemia occurred at a median of 28 days. The median duration of ALT and AST increase was 28 days 
[Table 12-14 of CICL670ATR04 CSR]. 
Assessor’s comment 
The MAH did not provide a table with AEs related to study drug.  
Deaths, other serious adverse events and other significant adverse events 
There were no deaths during the study. 
During  the  study,  3  patients  experienced  6  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  None  of  them  was 
considered to be drug-related. The respective narratives are provided below: 
• 
Prior to start of deferasirox treatment, a  pediatric patient had elevated liver function tests and 
concomitant medication including ursodeoxycholic acid. On 14-Jan-2014, the subject 
experienced flu like symptoms, fever and bronchial infection which resulted in hospitalization 
on the same day. It was reported that the subject's flu like symptoms, fever and bronchial 
infection were possibly due to influenza virus type B, and treatment with Enfluvir and 
Sulperazon was started. On 15-Jan-2014, the subject's laboratory test included influenza virus 
type B-PCR which was found to be positive (normal value-normal). On 17-Jan-2014, the

subject received the first dose of deferasirox at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. On 20-Jan-2014, he 
completely recovered from the event and was discharged from the hospital. On 25-Feb-2014, 
the subject was hospitalized for his routine annual control, laboratory tests were normal and 
was discharged from the hospital on26-Feb-2014. The investigator assessed the event (fever, 
flu-like symptoms, bronchial infection (influenza virus type B)) as serious (hospitalization). The 
investigator did not suspect a relation between the event (fever, flu like symptoms, bronchial 
infection (influenza virus type B) and the study medication as the study treatment was not 
started prior to the onset of the event. The investigator also stated that the subject was 
hospitalized for his annual control after "HSCI" and this hospitalization was not relevant to the 
study treatment. Although the patient experienced ALT and AST increased at two measurement 
points, they were Grade 1 and 2 events, and required no action. 
•  A pediatric subject with a medical history of gallbladder sludge. He had bronchitis (grade 2) 
and was taking Augmentine, when treatment was started with deferasirox at a dose of 10 
mg/kg/day on 20-Jan-2014. The subject underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 
due to beta thalassemia. On 03-Mar-2014, his ALT (846 IU/L; grade 4) and AST levels (1008 
IU/L; grade 4). On 05-Mar-2014, the subject was diagnosed with viral hepatitis B, the patient 
received Zeffix, and treatment with study medication was temporarily interrupted for one 
month due to event. Investigator reported that the event improved after study medication was 
interrupted. On 10-Mar-2014, AST was 1098 IU/L grade 4, ALT was 743 IU/L grade 3, serology 
test including HBsAG was performed which was positive at a value of 25.63 (grade 2) and anti 
HBs value was less than 5 (grade 2). On 25-Mar-2014, AST was 60 IU/L and ALT was 59 IU/L. 
On 16 Apr 2014, AST was 50 IU/L (normal value: 10 to 40) CTCAE grade 1 and ALT was 19 
IU/L (normal value: 8 to 40) CTCAE grade 1. The event was assessed as serious (medically 
significant) by the investigator. The investigator confirmed that the event was not due to 
progression of the underlying disease. The other possible contributory factor for ALT and AST 
increase included hepatitis B infection. The investigator did not suspect a causal relationship 
between the event and the study medication. The investigator gave a rationale that the 
etiologic cause of liver dysfunction, hepatitis B, tested positive in the subject. Hence the drug 
was considered as not related to liver dysfunction. 
• 
Prior to start of deferasirox treatment, a pediatric patient presented on 9-Dec-2013 with 
neutrophil count decreased (0.49 x 109/L, neutropenia grade 4) with no hospitalization. On 10-
Dec-2013, the subject started treatment with 125 mg deferasirox twice daily. On 18-Dec-2013, 
the subject was reported to have infection and received treatment with Augmentin. No action 
was taken with regard to the study medication due to this event. On 23-Dec-2013, neutropenia 
was resolved. On 26-Dec-2013, the subject completely recovered from neutropenia grade 4 
and infection and the hemoglobin value was 1.876/mm3. The investigator assessed the events 
as serious (medically significant) and did not suspect any relationship between the event and 
study medication. In summary, the patient had neutropenia before the start of the study drug, 
and he had neutropenia and anemia Grade 1 and 2 at some measurement points throughout 
the study. 
Four patients experienced 6 AEs that led to study drug adjustment or temporary discontinuation: 
•  One patient experienced diarrhoea and vomiting 
•  One patient had ALT and AST increased 
•  One patient had ALT increased

•  One patient experienced hepatic enzymes increased, which was considered to be drug related 
by the investigator. 
All AEs required dose adjustment or temporary discontinuation recovered to Grade 1 or less. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
Creatinine increased levels (33% increase from baseline (BL) and above upper limit of normal (ULN) at 
two consecutive visits at least 5 days apart) was observed in 1 patient (3.7%) 
Increase in proteinuria was observed in 9 patients (33.3%) [Table 14-11 and 14-14 of CICL670ATR04 
CSR]. 
ALT  increased  levels  (BL  ALT<ULN,  3X  BL/5X  ULN)  were  recorded  in  9  patients  (33.3%)  and  AST 
increased  levels  (BL  AST  ≥ULN,  3X  BL/5X  ULN)  in  3  patients  (11.1%)  [Table  14-  14  and  14-15  of

Assessor’s comment  
The  safety  population,  with  subjects  from  the  FAS  having  had  at  least  one  safety  assessment  post 
baseline, consisted of 25 patients. 
Research in the line listing of  AEs by patient find 10 adverse events related to study medication in 4 
patients  (14.8%):  6  ALT  increased  (three  grade  3  with  two  of  them  resulted  on  study  drug  dosage 
adjusted/temporarily  interrupted,  one  grade  2  resulted  on  study  drug  dosage  adjusted/temporarily 
interrupted and two grade 1), 2 AST increased of grade 3 with one of them of them resulted on study 
drug  dosage  adjusted/temporarily  interrupted,  one  hepatic  enzyme  increased  of  grade  2  resulted  on 
study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted and one urinary tract infection of grade 1.  
In this study, elevation of transaminase  was the most reported AEs related to study drug medication 
and was seen in 4 (14.8%) patients. This frequency is higher than reported in the SmPC for the overall 
population, for which elevations of transaminases were reported in 2% of patients. 
Overall, there were no deaths during the study and no unexpected safety findings.  
Discrepancies  regarding  the  number  of  drug  adjustment  or  temporary  discontinuation  are  noted 
between table 12-18 and 12-19 of the clinical overview and the line listing of AEs by patient. Research 
in  the  line  listing  find  4  patients  with  8  AEs  that  led  to  study  drug  adjustment  or  temporary 
discontinuation whereas in the table 12-18 and 12-19 the reported number is 4 patients with 6 AEs.   
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  which  led  to  study  drug  adjustment  or  temporary  discontinuation 
was elevation of transaminase (6AEs of 8AEs).

MAH’s conclusion 
Overall,  there  were  no  unexpected  safety  findings  in  the  27  pediatric  patients  with  beta  thalassemia 
after HSCT following treatment with deferasirox dispersible tablets up to a dose of 20 mg/kg daily for 
12 months. Incidence, type and severity of AEs including renal, hepatic, biochemistry and hematologic 
parameters are consistent with the known safety profile of deferasirox. 
Median  serum  ferritin  levels  and  liver  iron  overload  (measured  with  R2*MRI)  significantly  decreased 
during  the  course  of  the  study  indicating  that  deferasirox  at  doses  between  10  to  20  mg/kg/day  is 
effective in decreasing iron overload in beta thalassemia major pediatric patients after HSCT. 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk assessment for deferasirox remains positive for the currently approved 
indications and justifies continuation of the development program in pediatric patients. 
No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox Core Data Sheet are proposed as a 
result  of  this  study  and  no  regulatory  consequences  of  the  submitted  study  are  anticipated  for  the 
pediatric information in the EU SmPC. 
Assessor’s comment 
Efficacy 
Concerning efficacy data, the ferritin levels were assessed as second objectives and should be used as 
supportive data. 
Safety 
Type  and  severity  of  AEs  including  renal,  hepatic,  biochemistry  and  hematologic  parameters  are 
consistent with the known safety profile of deferasirox. 
In this study, incidence of elevation of transaminases (4 patients, 14.8%) were higher than reported in 
the SmPC for the overall population, for which elevation of transaminases were reported in 2% of 
patients. 
However, these data should be taken with cautions as only 27 patients were included in this study 
among 9 study centers in Turkey. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Patients with homozygous beta thalassemia require chronic blood transfusions to survive; however, 
ineffective erythropoiesis and transfusions cause iron overload that is ultimately fatal if not 
continuously treated. The only available alternative therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT). 
Persistence of tissue iron overload can cause significant morbidity and mortality, such as that seen in 
hereditary hemochromatosis. Progression of liver disease to cirrhosis has been documented in some 
patients in the years after transplantation. Thus, iron removal by phlebotomy (the first treatment

because of the potential toxicity of oral chelators especially when combined with cyclosporine) or 
chelation is indicated in all transplanted thalassemic patients who have evidence of hepatic iron 
overload.  
The objective of this procedure is to comply with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 that 
requires any marketing authorization holder-sponsored studies which involve the use in the pediatric 
population of a medicinal product covered by a marketing authorization, whether or not they are 
conducted in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, to be submitted to the competent 
authority. 
Study CICL670ATR04 is a MAH-sponsored study that has been recently completed and qualifies for 
Article 46 submission. This was a phase II, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of deferasirox in beta thalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT). 
Concerning efficacy data, the ferritin levels were assessed as second objectives and should be used as 
supportive data. 
The changes in serum ferritin levels were first assessed from baseline to 12th month. Comparison of 
liver iron concentration by MRI examination before and after transplantation should be more relevant 
to assess efficacy as the serum ferritin levels could be higher (effect due to inflammation) in the first 
year after transplantation. Serum ferritin levels decreased with deferasirox but this effect became 
significant from baseline since Week 20. This effect is sustained until Week 48 but the result should be 
taken with cautions because of the limited number of patients (n=25) and the high difference between 
the lower and upper bounds of the serum ferritin median range in each patients visit. Finally, a 
percentage of 33.3% of patients reaching serum ferritin levels lower than 500 µg/l at the final 
evaluation visit (Week 52). 
This study failed to demonstrate an improvement of cardiac iron overload (Cardiac MRI: 25.95 vs. 
28.00; p=0.520). However, a decrease of liver iron overload could be observed from baseline to Week 
52 (Liver MRI: 8.6 vs. 4.1; p<0.001). 
Finally, the primary objective of the present study was to determine the safety; incidence, type and 
severity of adverse events including renal, hepatic, biochemistry and hematologic parameters of 
deferasirox in the treatment of iron overload after HSCT in patients with beta-thalassemia major in 12 
months period.  
A total of 25 patients comprised the Safety set. Ten AEs related to study medication were found in 4 
patients (14.8%). The drug related AEs reported in the pediatric population were ALT increased, AST 
increased, hepatic enzyme increased and urinary tract infection. 
In this study, elevation of transaminases were the most reported AEs related to study drug medication 
and were seen in 4 (14.8%) patients. This frequency is higher than reported in the SmPC for the 
overall population, for which elevations of transaminases were reported in 2% of patients.

In conclusion, data collected in this study allow to document safety data of deferasirox in beta-
thalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but should be taken 
with cautions as only 27 patients were included in this study among 9 study centers in Turkey. 
Based  on  the  data  provided,  we  can  conclude  that  no  unexpected  safety  findings  were  identified.  A 
higher frequency of elevation of transaminases related to study drug medication was seen in this study 
than  reported  in  the  SmPC  for  the  overall  population  whereas  in  this  study  a  decrease  of  liver  iron 
overload  could  be  observed  from  baseline  to  Week  52.  However,  this  occurred  in  a  very  limited 
population of patients with expected severity of AE. No further regulatory action are required from this 
procedure. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

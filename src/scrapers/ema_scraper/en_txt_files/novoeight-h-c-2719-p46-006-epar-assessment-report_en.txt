1.  Introduction 
On 28 December 2016, the MAH submitted the final study report for NovoEight clinical trial NN7008-
3568, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended (eCTD 044). A short 
critical expert overview has been provided. No regulatory consequences have been identified by the 
MAH. 
NOTE: The trial product, turoctocog alfa, was previously named N8. The name was changed to 
turoctocog alfa after finalisation of the protocol for this trial. 
Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
Study no. NN7008-3568, evaluating safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in prevention and on 
demand treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects with haemophilia A, is part of the turoctocog alfa 
clinical development program. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Turoctocog alfa is a B-domain truncated recombinant human coagulation factor VIII without any other 
modifications in the amino acid sequence. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells, and prepared without the addition of any human or animal derived protein in the 
cell culture process, purification or final formulation. It was supplied as a sterile, freeze-dried powder in 
single-use vials of 250 IU/vial and 2000 IU/vial to be reconstituted with 4.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride 
for injection. After reconstitution, each 250 IU vial contained 62.5 IU/mL of turoctocog alfa and each 
2000 IU vial contained 500 IU/mL of turoctocog alfa. The reconstituted solution was colourless, almost 
clear with a pH of 6.9 and was not to be further diluted. It was recommended to use turoctocog alfa 
immediately after reconstitution. Exposure to direct sunlight and/or freezing was to be avoided. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study no. NN7008-3568 to assess safety and efficacy of 
turoctocog alfa in prevention and on demand treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects with 
haemophilia A. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Objectives (for main trial and on-demand sub-trial) 
Primary objective: 
• 
To assess the safety of turoctocog alfa for prevention (only applicable for subjects in the 
preventive regimen) and treatment of bleeds. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Secondary objective: 
• 
• 
To assess the efficacy of turoctocog alfa for prevention (only applicable for subjects in the 
preventive regimen) and treatment of bleeds. 
To assess Patient Reported Outcomes over time (only for applicable subjects). 
With Amendment 17 to the protocol, two new treatment regimens were added – once every third day 
and twice weekly regimens in order to investigate the effect of less frequent than the standard 
prophylaxis dosing on annualised bleeding rates. 
Primary objective for the surgery sub-trial: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of turoctocog alfa in surgery. 
Secondary objectives for the surgery sub-trial: 
•  With Amendment 1, this objective was added: To evaluate the haemostatic response to 
turoctocog alfa in the postsurgery period. 
• 
To evaluate the safety of turoctocog alfa in surgery. 
With Amendment 17, a PK sub-trial in subjects with high BMI was added.  
Primary objective for the PK sub-trial: 
• 
To investigate single dose pharmacokinetics in patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 
Study design 
The NN7008-3568 trial was designed as a non-randomised, open-label, multi-national, single 
treatment arm, safety and efficacy extension trial wherein patients completing one of the trials 
NN7008-3543, NN7008-3545, NN7008-3600, NN7008-3893 and N7008-4015 could continue treatment 
with turoctocog alfa. In this trial, long-term safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in patients with 
hemophilia A without inhibitors and a FVIII activity ≤1% were evaluated. Furthermore, a surgery sub-
trial was designed to provide information on efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa administered as 
either bolus or continuous infusion during surgery. All patients had the possibility to undergo major 
and minor surgery as part of the surgery sub-trial if the surgical intervention required at least 7 days 
of turoctocog alfa surgery related treatment including the day of surgery. An on-demand sub-trial was 
added to ensure collection of data in patients in an on-demand regimen. In addition, a pharmacokinetic 
sub-trial investigating the pharmacokinetics in patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 was added. Eligible 
patients were to be administered a single dose of turoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg) followed by blood 
sampling for PK evaluation.

Treatments 
Patients received either a preventive regimen with scheduled preventive turoctocog alfa infusions 
(20−50 IU/kg BW once every second day or 20−60 IU/kg BW three times weekly [standard 
prophylaxis dosing regimen]; 40−60 IU/kg BW twice weekly or once every third day [less frequent 
dosing regimen]) with additional treatment for bleeds or on-demand treatment of bleeds as they 
occurred and occasionally as preventive treatment (for example, before physical activity). Dose levels 
up to 200 IU/kg per day could be used depending on the severity and location of the bleed. Dose levels 
for treatment of bleeds were 20-50 IU/kg BW. In total up to 150 IU/kg BW per day could be used to 
treat severe bleeds. Doses totalling up to 150 IU/kg BW per day could be used at the discretion of the 
Investigator to treat subjects during elective surgery. Bolus and continuous infusion with turoctocog 
alfa could be chosen during surgery. If a haemostatic response could not be achieved after 48 hours 
using maximal doses of turoctocog alfa when treating bleeds, another FVIII product could be selected 
at the discretion of the investigator, and the patient was withdrawn from the trial. No placebo and no 
comparators were included in the trial. 
In the PK sub-trial, patients were administered a single dose of 50 IU/kg turoctocog alfa followed by 
blood sampling for PK evaluation over 3 days with an optional sampling on the 4th day.

Statistical Methods 
Determination of sample size: 
The sample size was based on the number of patients who completed the studies NN7008-3543, 
NN7008-3545, NN7008-3600, NN7008-3893 and NN7008-4015 and the number of patients that would 
participate in the on demand sub-trial. It was estimated that a total of up to 214 patients would 
participate in the trial. 
Definition of analysis sets: 
The FAS included all dosed patients. All main descriptions and analyses of safety and efficacy data 
were based on the full analysis set (FAS). FVIII inhibitor development during the trial was summarised 
and listed by age group and by type of regimen (i.e. for preventive and on-demand regimen, 
respectively). 
Efficacy: 
All efficacy endpoints were to be reported using treatment requiring bleeds only. As a sensitivity 
analysis, the annualised bleeding rate was to be calculated for both treatment-requiring bleeds and 
non-treatment requiring bleeds. The haemostatic response to turoctocog alfa evaluated according to a 
predefined four point scale (none, moderate, good or excellent) was to be presented using counts and 
percentages of all treatment requiring bleeds. The haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa was also to be 
presented using a success/failure rate. Bleeds evaluated as excellent and good were to be counted as 
success and bleeds evaluated as moderate and none were to be counted as failure. The success/failure 
rate was to be repeated counting bleeds with missing evaluation as failure. 
The number of infusions required to treat a bleed (from start to stop of the bleed) were to be 
presented using counts and percentages of all treatment-requiring bleeds. Furthermore, the number of 
infusions of turoctocog alfa per treatment requiring bleed was to be summarised and listed. 
Classification of re-bleed was to be performed at the time of the statistical analysis, according to the 
following criteria: A re-bleed is defined as a new bleed (worsening of bleeding site conditions e.g. 
swelling, pain) within 72 hours after stopping of a previous bleed at the same or a subset of the same 
anatomical locations. All summary tables regarding the haemostatic response and the number of 
infusions required to treat a bleed were to be presented by age group and by type of regimen. 
The annualised bleeding rate in total and by cause of bleed, excluding bleeds occurring more than 72 
hours after last turoctocog alfa dose, was to be presented with a 95% confidence interval for subject 
on preventative regimen. 
The number of hours since last turoctocog alfa dose when a treatment-requiring bleed occurs were to 
be summarised and listed for subjects on preventive regimen. 
The consumption of turoctocog alfa used for prevention and the consumption used for treatment of 
bleed was to be summarised and listed for subjects on preventive regimen.

The consumption of turoctocog alfa used for treatment of bleed was to be summarised and listed for 
subjects in the on demand regimen. 
Safety: 
The primary endpoint was the frequency of development of FVIII inhibitors (≥0.6 BU). FVIII inhibitor 
development during the trial was summarised and listed by age group and by type of regimen. (i.e. for 
preventive and on-demand regimen, respectively). The secondary safety endpoints: AEs and SAEs 
reported during the trial were summarised in total, in relation to the preventive regimen and in relation 
to the on demand regimen. 
The primary endpoint for the surgery part of the trial was haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa 
assessed by evaluation according to a predefined four point scale: none, moderate, good or excellent. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints for the surgery part of the trial were assessment of the actual 
consumption of turoctocog alfa (IU/kg) in the time period day 1 to day 7 and in the time period day 8 
to return to pre-surgery regimen; comparison of actual and anticipated blood loss; haemoglobin level 
prior to surgery, during, and after surgery (pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative) and 
blood product transfusion. Evaluation of efficacy during surgery was based on descriptive statistics. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 214 patients were enrolled and 213 of these were dosed with turoctocog alfa in the trial. One 
patient withdrew before dosing and was therefore excluded from the full analysis set (n=213). A total 
of 82 patients were withdrawn from the trial: 2 patients due to AEs, 3 due to non-compliance with the 
protocol, 13 due to meeting withdrawal criteria, and 64 due to reasons categorised as ‘other’. 43 of the 
latter withdrew from the trial to join a Novo Nordisk pathfinder trial. 
The majority of enrolled patients (n = 207) was treated prophylactically in the main trial and a total of 
9 patients were on an on-demand regimen (sub-trial FAS n=14) with few patients switching between 
both regimen. Overall, 130 patients completed the main trial. A total of 17 patients participated in the 
surgery sub-trial. 18 major surgeries were performed in 14 patients and 3 minor surgeries in 3 
patients during the trial. 6 patients participated in the PK sub-trial.  
Baseline data 
The study population consisted of male patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII activity ≤1%) and 
was divided into 4 age groups: small children (0 to <6 years, n=27), older children (6 to <12 years, 
n=28), adolescents (12 to <18 years, n=23) and adults (≥18 years, n=135). The majority of the 
patients were White (83.1%) and the second largest group was the Asian population (11.3%). Patients 
participating in the PK sub-trial had a mean BMI of 33.35 kg/m2.  
Efficacy results 
Annualised bleeding rate: 
• 
The overall estimated annualised bleeding rate among patients following a preventive regimen 
was 2.44 bleeds/patient/year (95% CI: 2.06−2.89 bleeds/patient/year) during a total of 730.8 
years, with 1.86 bleeds/patient/year in small children, 2.88 bleeds/patient/year in older 
children, 1.96 bleeds/patient/year in adolescents and 2.59 bleeds/patient/year in adults.

• 
• 
The overall estimated annualised bleeding rate among patients following a preventive less 
frequent dosing regimen was 2.01 bleeds/patient/year (95% CI: 1.21−3.33 
bleeds/patient/year) during a total of 16.9 years, with no bleeds in small children (n=2), 2.62 
bleeds/patient/year in older children, 2.69 bleeds/patient/year in adolescents and 1.32 
bleeds/patient/year in adults. 
The overall estimated annualised bleeding rate among patients following on-demand regimen 
was 24.02 bleeds/patient/year (95% CI: 16.90−34.15 bleeds/patient/year) during a total of 
16.3 years, with 18.49 bleeds/patient/year in the on-demand regimen of the main trial and 
32.36 bleeds/patient/year in the on-demand sub trial. The annualised bleeding rate reported in 
adults only in both the on-demand regimen of the main trial and on demand sub-trial was 
24.96 bleeds/patient/year. 
Median annualised bleeding rate: 
• 
• 
• 
The overall median annualised bleeding rate among patients following a preventive regimen 
was 1.37 bleeds/year (IQR: 2.96). 
The overall median annualised bleeding rate among patients following a preventive less 
frequent dosing regimen was 0.00 bleeds/year (IQR: 3.63). 
The overall median annualised bleeding rate among patients following on-demand regimen was 
30.44 bleeds/year (IQR: 28.10). 
Success rate: 
•  During the preventive regimen, the success rate for treatment of bleeds in the FAS was 89.8% 
when bleeds with missing evaluation of haemostatic response were counted as failure and 
90.2% when missing evaluations were excluded. 
•  During the preventive less frequent dosing regimen, the success rate for treatment of bleeds in 
the FAS was 94.1%; there were no bleeds with missing evaluation of haemostatic response in 
this regimen. 
•  During the on-demand treatment, the success rate for the treatment of bleeds in the FAS was 
96.7%; there were no bleeds with missing evaluation of haemostatic response in this regimen. 
Number of injections needed to stop bleeds: 
•  Of the 1,782 reported bleeds during the preventive regimen, 1,297 (72.8%) were stopped with 
1 injection of turoctocog alfa, 275 (15.4%) were stopped with 2 injections and 101 (5.7%) 
were stopped with 3 injections. 
•  During the preventive less frequent dosing regimen, of the 34 reported bleeds, 26 (76.5%) 
were stopped with 1 injection of turoctocog alfa, 6 (17.6%) were stopped with 2 injections and 
2 (5.9%) were stopped with 3 injections. 
•  Of the 391 reported bleeds during the on-demand regimen, 310 (79.3%) were stopped with 1 
injection of turoctocog alfa, 61 (15.6%) were stopped with 2 injections and 15 (3.8%) were 
stopped with 3 injections and 5 (1.3%) were stopped with 4 injections. 
Efficacy in surgery: 
• 
The haemostatic response for the 18 major and 3 minor surgeries was rated as “excellent” or 
“good” both during and after surgery.

In the preventive regimen, the mean dose was 32.5 IU/kg BW and the mean consumption per 
patient per year for prevention was 5,094 IU/kg BW/year/patient. The mean consumption used 
for treatment of a bleed from start to stop of a bleed was 62.1 IU/kg BW/bleeding episode for 
patients during the preventive regimen.  
The mean dose used during the preventive less frequent dosing regimen was 48.2 IU/kg BW 
and the mean consumption per patient per year for prevention was 5,432 IU/kg 
BW/year/patient. The mean consumption used for treatment of a bleed from start to stop of a 
bleed was 53.6 IU/kg BW/bleeding episode for patients during the preventive regimen. 
The mean dose used during the on-demand regimen was 36.2 IU/kg BW and the mean 
consumption used for treatment of a bleed from start to stop of a bleed was 43.9 IU/kg 
BW/bleeding episode. 
In regard to total consumption of turoctocog alfa and annualised bleeding rate, patients on the 
preventive regimen consumed a mean total of 5284 IU/kg BW/year/patient, which was three-
fold higher than the mean total consumption of turoctog alfa during the on-demand regimen 
(1505 IU/kg BW/year/patient). Increased consumption in the preventive regimen was 
associated with a 90% reduction in annualised bleeding rate compared to that reported during 
the on-demand regimen (2.44 vs 24.02 bleeds/patient/year, respectively). 
• 
In surgery, consumption differed largely and total consumption ranged between 225 IU/kg (i.e. 
a case of major surgery of gall stones) and 6711 IU/kg (i.e. major surgery in case of 
arthropathia haemophilia requiring 140 days under surgery regimen) of turoctocog alfa.  
Safety results 
•  No FVIII inhibitors were detected. 
•  Overall, a total of 1278 AEs were reported for 184 (86.4%) patients exposed to turoctocog 
alfa), including patients undergoing surgery, corresponding to an AE rate of 1.7 (1278/756.7) 
events per patient year of exposure. 
• 
The most frequently reported AEs during the preventive regimen were headache (0.12 events 
per patient year of exposure), nasopharyngitis (0.09 events per patient year of exposure), 
upper respiratory tract infection (0.07 events per patient year of exposure) and pharyngitis 
(0.07 events per patient year of exposure). 
•  12 events in 8 of 213 patients were judged by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to turoctocog alfa; 11 out of 12 events were non-serious and of mild or moderate 
severity. One event of acute myocardial infarction in a 41 year old patient on-demand regimen 
of the main trial was considered serious and severe. 
•  A total of 49 SAEs (including 2 deaths) were reported in 41 patients. 46 SAEs were reported 
during the preventive regimen, 1 during on-demand regimen and 2 during surgery. All SAEs 
except for 1 were judged by the investigator as unlikely related to turoctocog alfa treatment. 
•  No events of hypersensitivity were assessed as related to turoctocog alfa. 
• 
Laboratory parameter assessments and other safety-related examinations did not indicate 
clinically significant changes as a result of turoctocog alfa administration.

Pharmacokinetic results 
• 
• 
The mean incremental recovery (chromogenic assay) was 0.035 (IU/mL)/(U/kg) and the mean 
AUC0−t (chromogenic assay) was 29.98 IUxh/mL; both parameters were higher than those 
expected in persons with normal weight. 
The mean t½ (chromogenic assay) was 12.40 h and the mean CL (chromogenic assay) was 
1.94 ml/h/kg. This result was expected in patients with higher body mass who have less 
plasma per kg body weight compared to persons with normal body composition. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final report of 
a phase 3b trial assessing safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in prevention and on-demand 
treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects with haemophilia A. The clinical study also included a 
surgery and PK sub-trial. Of the 213 treated subjects, 78 were pediatric patients including 55 patients 
below the age of 12. All patients participating in the PK sub-trial were adult and in the surgery sub-
trial, 3 from 17 patients were children (6-12 years of age) and 1 patient was adolescent. In general, 
the treatment with turoctocog alfa was well tolerated in all parts of the trial exhibiting a safety profile 
which was in line with expectations. No FVIII inhibitors or hypersensitivity events occurred in this trial. 
From 8 patients who experienced adverse events judged as being possibly or probably related, 7 
patients were adult and 1 patient was adolescent (14 years of age). The latter was diagnosed with a 
mild lichenoid keratosis/dermatitis which was judged as probably related and did not recover. No Lupus 
anticoagulant or relevant abnormalities were detected in hematologic and biochemistry safety analyses 
of this patient. FVIII recovery was regular and the patient was negative for FVIII inhibitor, HIV, 
hepatitis B and C. No specific clustering of this and the remaining possibly or probably treatment 
related SAE can be detected. Overall, no safety issues can be identified from this clinical trial.  
Efficacy of turoctocog alfa was demonstrated during both preventive treatment regimens as well as for 
on-demand treatment. Efficacy was also shown when used in major and minor surgeries (i.e. good or 
excellent haemostatic response during or after surgery). In accordance to the current guideline on the 
clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII products, age-stratified 
data on FVIII consumption for prophylaxis, on-demand therapy and during surgery are provided. In 
general, consumption in both preventive treatment regimens was higher in younger and older children 
when compared to adults. Regarding consumption and ABR, data for the standard (i.e. consumption of 
5,094 IU/kg BW/year/patient, ABR 2.44 bleeds/patient/year) and the less frequent (i.e. consumption 
of 5,432 IU/kg BW/year/patient, ABR 2.01 bleeds/patient/year) prophylaxis dosing regimen were 
largely the same.  
Overall, safety and efficacy data of pediatric patients provided by this study report are sufficiently 
covered by the current SmPC. It can be agreed that no regulatory consequences have been identified.

Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, the data reported from study no. NN7008-3568 confirm safety and efficacy of turoctocog 
alfa used in prophylaxis and on-demand treatment regimen as well as during surgery procedures in 
pediatric patients. The current benefit-risk profile remains unchanged and data from this study are 
adequately reflected in the current SmPC. No regulatory action required. No additional clarification 
requested.

1.  Introduction 
On 17 October 2022, the MAH submitted the results of paediatric study B7471016 for the assessment 
of Prevenar 13, pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (13-valent, adsorbed) 
EU/1/09/590/001-016, EMEA/H/C/1104, as amended and in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study title and number is part of a clinical development program.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
B7471016  
13vPnC was a sterile liquid suspension formulation containing saccharides from pneumococcal 
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to CRM197.  
The vaccine was formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B, per 0.5-mL 
dose. The vaccine contained 295 μg succinate buffer, 0.85% sodium chloride, 100 μg polysorbate 80, 
and 125 μg aluminium as aluminium phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose. 
The 13vPnC supply was considered representative of Prevnar 13, as it was manufactured according to 
the approved Prevnar 13 commercial drug product process using commercially released vaccine drug 
substances. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study B7471016.  
Study B7471016 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, third-party unblinded trial to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (20vPnC) in healthy 
Japanese infants. The purpose of the B7471016 study was to provide key safety and comparative 
immunogenicity data between 20vPnC and the 13vPnC in Japanese infants to help support licensure for 
20vPnC paediatric use in Japan. Participants aged 2 to 6 months were randomised to receive 4 doses 
of 20vPnC (by subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular injection), or 13vPnC (by SC injection as a control). 
This assessment concerns only participants receiving the 13vPnC vaccine in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006.

2.3.2.  Clinical study B7471016 
Description 
Methods 
Study participants 
This study enrolled approximately 666 infants between 2 through 6 months of age at the time of 
consent by their parent(s)/legal guardian(s). Participants were randomized equally to one of the 
following vaccine groups:  
20vPnC SC group, 13vPnC SC group (control vaccine), or 20vPnC IM group. 
Hereafter, only information and data from the 13vPnC SC group (control vaccine) is described and 
discussed.  
Participants received the same vaccine by the same injection method (SC injection) for all 4 doses at 
visits 1, 2, 3, and 5. All vaccine groups were blinded to all members of the site involved in the study 
except unblinded site staff who administered 13vPnC. A brief overview of the study design is presented 
in Figure 1.  
Treatments 
Participants received 1 dose of 13vPnC at each vaccination visit (Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5 with Doses 1, 2, 
3, and 4). Doses 1 to 3 were preferred to be administered at 2, 3, and 4 months of age consistent with 
the vaccination schedule recommended by the Japan Pediatric Society. In addition, Dose 3 was to be 
completed by 12 months of age and Dose 4 was to be administered ≥60 days after Dose 3.  
13vPnC was administered SC by injecting 0.5 mL into the anterolateral thigh (preferably into the left 
anterolateral thigh) at the vaccination visits.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind, third party unblinded study. The study staff administering the vaccine and 
confirming the administration route of study intervention were unblinded, but all other site study 
personnel, including the PI and the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the participant, were blinded. Designated

study team members who were involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for study intervention 
handling, allocation, and administration were fulfilled at sites were unblinded. All other study team 
members and all laboratory personnel performing the serology assays remained blinded to vaccine 
assigned/received throughout the study. 
CHMP rapporteur comments:  
In the methods described for paediatric study B7471016 it is noted and that all participants in the 
13vPnCV group received 0,5 mL of Prevenar 13, pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (13-
valent, adsorbed), by a subcutaneous route of administration.  
Despite that subcutaneous route of administration is not used in Europe the methods described for 
study B7471016 for the assessment of Prevenar 13, are relevant and in accordance with Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
Results 
Number analysed 
A total of 668 participants were randomized and 649 (97.2%) participants completed all  
visits in the study. Disposition of all randomized participants was balanced across  
vaccine groups. A total of 224 participants were randomized to receive 13vPnC administered SC (Table 
2). Of the participants withdrawn from the study, the most common reason was withdrawn by  
parent/guardian.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics of sex, race, ethnicity, and age for the safety  
population were balanced across the vaccine groups. Across the vaccine groups, all participants were 
Asian (Japanese), and 49.4% were males. Demographic characteristics for the Dose 3 and Dose 4 
evaluable immunogenicity populations were similar to those for the safety population. 
Important Protocol Deviations (PDs) 
No important PDs that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the 
trial occurred in the 13vPnC group. Four (4) PDs were specifically attributed to COVID-19 occurrence. 
These PDs were due to visits being performed outside the protocol-specified window and were not 
considered important.  
Populations Analyzed 
Table 3 provide a summary of participants excluded from the immunogenicity and safety populations, 
respectively, with reasons for exclusion.

Exposure 
Vaccine administration by dose and non-study vaccines also administered with the 20vPnC or  
13vPnC doses are presented in Table 5. Table 5 includes concomitant vaccines which were  
specified to be administered concomitantly with study intervention at intervals consistent with the 
vaccination schedule recommended by the Japan Pediatric Society. Approximately 50% of participants 
received a third dose of rotavirus vaccine according to the rotavirus vaccine schedule (either 2 or 3 
infant doses for monovalent or pentavalent, respectively).

Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity Assessments 
IgG concentrations and OPA titers were measured in sera collected at the 3 immunogenicity  
time points (Visits 4, 5, and 6). OPA titers were measured in a randomly selected subset of  
participants. 
MAH conclusion on response to 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC (in short) 
The percentage of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations 1 month  
after Dose 3 of 20vPnC SC was noninferior to 13vPnC SC for 11 of the 13 matched serotypes (all but 
serotypes 6A and 6B), and to the lowest serotype in the 13vPnC SC group for 5 of 7 additional 
serotypes (all but serotypes 10A and 12F). Out of the 13 matched serotypes, 6A and 6B missed this 
endpoint by a small margin. The totality of data supports that the immune responses elicited by 
20vPnC are expected to be effective against disease caused by the 20 vaccine serotypes, including 
those that missed NI. 
• Post hoc analysis with alternative defined level of ≥0.15 μg/mL for IgG concentrations at this time

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

point showed that serotype 6A would have met NI of 20vPnC SC to 13vPnC SC at this level with the 
same NI criterion. 
• The majority of participants (90.0% for serotype 6A and 87.8% for serotype 6B) in the 20vPnC SC 
group had predefined IgG concentrations for those serotypes 1 month after Dose 3, with increases at 1 
month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC SC (100% for serotypes 6A and 6B) comparable to 13vPnC SC.  
• The IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 3 of 20vPnC SC were noninferior to 13vPnC SC for 10 of the 13 
matched serotypes and to 6 of the 7 additional serotypes compared to the lowest in the 13vPnC SC 
group. Serotypes 5, 6A, 6B, and 10A missed NI; serotypes 5, 6A, and 10A missed the statistical 
criterion by a small margin.  
• 20vPnC SC elicited robust OPA antibody responses to the 20 vaccine serotypes in terms of OPA 
GMTs. The percentage of participants with OPA titers ≥LLOQ for these serotypes were generally similar 
to those in the 13vPnC SC group 1 month after Dose 3 or Dose 4. 
• Following 3 infant doses of 20vPnC SC, infants were primed for memory responses to the 13 matched 
vaccine serotypes, similar to the 13vPnC SC. This was shown by IgG GMFRs from 1 month after Dose 3 
to 1 month after Dose 4 >1.0 for all serotypes except serotype 3. The IgG GMFRs in the 20vPnC SC 
group for the serotypes that missed NI for the primary objective (serotypes 6A, 6B, 10A, and 12F) 
were 3.4 or higher 1 month after Dose 4. Boosting from before Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 was 
also observed for all serotypes. Increases in OPA GMTs and ≥4-fold rises in OPA titers were observed 
for most serotypes after Dose 4.  
• Observed IgG and OPA responses for all 7 additional serotypes were much higher in the  
20vPnC SC group (consistent with superior, statistically significantly higher antibody levels) when 
compared with the corresponding serotype responses in the 13vPnC SC group. Therefore, 20vPnC 
elicits potentially protective antibody responses in infants that are not available in existing vaccines. 
CHMP rapporteur comments:  
The rapporteur agrees on MAH summary on immunogenicity results.  
Safety results 
Safety assessment included local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site),  
systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability), and  
antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days following vaccination, recorded by participants’  
parents/legal guardians using an e-diary.  
AEs and SAEs were collected from the signing of the ICD through and including Visit 4, and  
from Visit 5 to Visit 6. Between Visit 4 and Visit 5, only SAEs and NDCMCs were reported. 
Immediate (acute) AEs occurring within the first 30 minutes after each investigational product 
administration were assessed and documented as an AE or SAE, as appropriate, in the CRF.  
Local Reactions 
The percentages of participants with local reactions after Doses 1 through 4 were 81.7%, 90.1%, 
87.8%, and 88.2% in the 13vPnC SC group. Injection site redness was the most reported local 
reaction. Most local reactions reported were mild or moderate. One (1) participant had injection site 
subcutaneous bleeding reported on Day 1 after Dose 3 which was reported as resolved on Day 92. This 
event was reported as an AE, was mild in severity, and resolved. 
The median day of onset for local reactions was between Day 1 and Day 2. The median duration of 
local reactions was between 1 and 5 days.

Local reactions reported by participants, by maximum severity, within 7 days after vaccination with 
20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, or 20vPnC IM are presented in figure 14.17. The percentages of participants 
with local reactions after Doses 1 through 4 were generally similar across the 20vPnC SC group 
(82.7%, 80.3%, 82.4%, and 90.4%) and 13vPnC SC group (81.7%, 90.1%, 87.8%, and 88.2%), 
respectively. Injection site redness was the most reported local reaction. Most local reactions reported 
were mild or moderate. There were no apparent differences in the incidence or severity of local 
reactions between the 20vPnC SC and 13vPnC SC groups. There was a lower proportion of reported 
swelling and redness in the 20vPnC IM group than in either of the SC vaccine groups.  
Systemic Events 
The percentages of participants with any systemic event after Doses 1 through 4 were 64.3%, 65.3%, 
56.1%, and 59.5% in the 13vPnC SC group. Irritability and drowsiness were the most reported events. 
There were no clinically important differences in the rates of systemic events. Most systemic events 
were mild or moderate. 
The percentage of participants with any fever reported was (<43%). An increase in the frequency of 
fever of ≥ 38.9°C was observed following Dose 4 for which the MAH considered concomitant vaccine 
administration as having a contributory role. Fever > 40°C was not reported in the 13vPnC SC group. 
The percentage of participants with reported use of antipyretic or pain medication was low in the 
13vPnC SC group (0%, 0%, 0.9%, and 7.3%). 
The median day of onset for systemic events was between Day 1 and Day 3. The median duration of 
systemic events was between 1 and 2 days. 
Summary of Adverse Events 
At least 1 AE was reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 in 55.4% of participants in the 
13vPnC SC group. The SOC of infections and infestations was reported most frequently and included 
nasopharyngitis (16.5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (2.2%). 
At least 1 AE was reported from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 in 43.2% of participants. As with the 
AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, the SOC of infections and infestations were reported most 
frequently and included nasopharyngitis (15.5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1.4%). 
Related Adverse Event. The most frequently reported related AEs were in the SOC of general 
disorders and administration site conditions. No AE was reported in the 13vPnC SC group that was 
considered by the investigator to be related.

Immediate Adverse Events 
Immediate AEs were reported infrequently in the 13vPnC SC group. These were generally cutaneous 
events at the injection site. There were no events that were consistent with anaphylaxis or serious 
allergic reaction. One (1) participant was withdrawn from the study due to the related immediate AE of 
generalized erythema. This event was according to the MAH moderate in severity, resolved on the day 
of onset, and was not considered an SAE.  
Severe Adverse Events 
Severe AEs were reported infrequently from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 (for ≤2.3% of 
participants) and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 (for <1% of participants). 
Newly Diagnosed Chronic Medical Conditions (NDCMCs) 
The percentages of participants with NDCMCs after Dose 1 were low (≤10.7%) 1 month after Dose 4. 
NDCMCs were reported for ≤2.7% of participants from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 and reported 
for ≤0.9% of participants from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4. The majority of NDCMCs were new 
diagnoses of allergic conditions. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the 13vPnC SC group. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The percentages of participants with SAEs after Dose 1 was low (≤7.4%). The most frequently 
reported SAEs were under the SOC of infections and infestations and were largely associated with 
respiratory syncytial virus infection (Table 23). 
SAEs were reported for ≤2.3% of participants from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 and ≤0.9% of 
participants from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4. No SAEs were considered related to study 
intervention.

Discontinuations from Study Intervention or Study Due to Adverse Events 
One (1) participant in the 13vPnC SC group was withdrawn from the trial because of an  
immediate AE of generalized erythema. 
Narratives of participants withdrawn from the study because of AEs are provided below. 
• 
A 4-month-old participant from Japan with no relevant medical history, received 2 doses of 13vPnC 
subcutaneously (SC) Day 1; Dose 1 and Day 36; Dose 2. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, hepatitis 
B virus vaccine, and Rotarix (rotavirus vaccine live oral 1V) were administered at the same time as Doses 
1 and 2. Additionally, the participant received Tetrabik (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and 
poliovirus vaccine) with Dose 2. The participant experienced generalized erythema 2 minutes after 
receiving Dose 2 Day 36; Relative Day 1. No mucosal lesions, or gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms 
were observed. The participant received oral steroid (Rinderon syrup) for erythema, which resolved on the 
same day of onset. 
The participant was withdrawn from further vaccination because of the generalized erythema. In the 
opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the generalized erythema was related to 
the 13vPnC SC. Because redness and swelling developed at the time of first pneumococcal vaccination, 
pneumococcal vaccine was suspected most. However, the possibility of other vaccines causing this reaction 
could not be ruled out. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
No events of special interest, narratives of any seizures or seizure-like events were reported as serious 
or nonserious AEs during the applicable collection period. 
CHMP rapporteur comments:  
It is noted that local reactions reported by participants, by maximum severity, within 7 days after  
vaccination with 20vPnC SC or 13vPnC SC was high. The percentages of participants with local 
reactions after Doses 1 through 4 were generally similar across the 20vPnC SC group (82.7%, 80.3%, 
82.4%, and 90.4%) and 13vPnC SC group (81.7%, 90.1%, 87.8%, and 88.2%), respectively. Most 
local reactions reported were mild or moderate. However, there was a lower proportion of reported 
swelling and redness in the 20vPnC IM group than in either of the SC vaccine groups, and thereby it is 
assessed that the high frequency of local reactions is caused by the subcutaneous route of 13vPnC.   
There was 1 participant who experienced generalized erythema 2 minutes after receiving Dose 2 (Day 
36; Relative Day 1). No mucosal lesions, or gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms were observed. 
The participant was withdrawn from further vaccination on because of the generalized erythema. In the 
opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the generalized erythema was 
related to the 13vPnC SC. Because redness and swelling developed at the time of first pneumococcal 
vaccination, pneumococcal vaccine was suspected most. However, the possibility of other vaccines 
causing this reaction could not be ruled out. The overall assessment of this case is agreed upon. 
Overall, no new safety concerns detected in participants receiving 4-dose series of SC 13vPnC. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions 
MAH Conclusion 
The opinion of the MAH is that no update to the EU Product Information for Prevenar 13 is required 
based on the results of B7471016, as the study is specific to Japanese infants, the SC route of 
administration is not used in Europe, and the benefit/risk profile of 13vPnC remains unchanged.

CHMP rapporteur comments: MAH conclusion is agreed. No changes are being proposed to the 
Prevenar 13 label.  
The submitted study does not change the benefit-risk balance for Prevenar 13. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The present study confirmed the safety of Prevenar 13 among Japanese infants administered by the SC 
route. The safety population was small (N= 224) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs 
is low.  
The subcutaneous route of administration is not used in Europe. Despite differences in the route of 
administration in Europe (IM) compared to Japan (SC) no new safety concern is raised from this study 
and the benefit/risk profile of 13vPnC remains unchanged. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate no new safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Nivolumab (Opdivo, BMS-936558, MDX-1106, ONO-4538) binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) T-
cell membrane receptor and thereby blocks its interaction with PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD ligand 2 
(PD-L2). 
Nivolumab is currently approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and several other 
countries. The approved dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy for all approved indications in 
the EU is 3 mg/kg administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W). 
The approved indications for nivolumab include: 
−  Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults, as monotherapy, approved on 19 Jun 
− 
− 
2015;  
Locally  advanced  or  metastatic  squamous-cell  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  after  prior 
chemotherapy in adults, as monotherapy, approved on 20 Jul 2015; 
Locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-squamous  NSCLC  after  prior  chemotherapy,  as  nivolumab 
monotherapy, approved on 04 Apr 2016; 
−  Advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior therapy, as nivolumab monotherapy, approved on 04 Apr 
2016; 
−  Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, 
approved on 11 May 2016; 
−  Relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant and 
treatment with brentuximab vedotin in adults, as monotherapy, approved on 13 Oct 2016; 
−  Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in adults progressing on or after platinum-based 
− 
therapy, as monotherapy, approved on 28 April 2017; 
Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of prior 
platinum-containing therapy, as monotherapy, approved on 2 June 2017. 
Stage III and Stage IV Resectable Melanoma 
The European incidence of malignant Melanoma varies from 3-5/100 000/year in Mediterranean 
countries to 12-25 /100 000-year in Nordic Countries, and this incidence is still rising1.  
For early-stage melanoma, surgical resection is the standard treatment and is world-wide associated 
with an excellent long-term survival prognosis for stage I (98%) and stage II (90%). However, 
patients with stage III disease, who have regional involvement at diagnosis, are at higher risk of 
recurrence after locoregional resections. Stage IIIA patients (according to AJCC 7th edition) have a 
primary tumour without ulceration and 1-3 micrometastases in the nodes while Stage IIIB and C have 
an ulcerating primary tumour and/or macrometastases in the nodes. The risk of recurrence increases 
with increasing disease stage. The overall 5-year RFS for stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC patients has been 
shown to be approximately 63%, 32%, and 11%2 . In the US, 5-year survival rates are 78%, 59% and 
40% respectively (American Cancer Society). Based on literature, recurrences in stage III melanoma 
are mostly likely to occur within 3 years3. 
The Stage IV survival rates are around 15-20%. Due to the increase in the use of newly approved 
drugs (PD-1 inhibitors, CTLA-4 inhibitors and targeted BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors) for systemic 
treatment of patients with unresectable and stage IV disease, these numbers might be an 
underestimation. Currently the staging of melanoma is based on the American Joint Committee on

Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition criteria. However, at the time when the pivotal trial CA209238 was recruiting 
patients, patients were staged using the 7th edition. The main differences in the updated 8th edition are 
in relation to the N categorization of regional lymph node status and nodal disease terminology. The 
term micrometastasis has been replaced by “clinically occult disease” as detected by sentinel lymph 
node biopsy (SLNB). Macrometastasis has been replaced by “clinically detected disease.” In-transit or 
satellite node metastasis or microsatellite metastasis with satellite nodes was formerly listed simply as 
N3, in the new system there are subcategories for N3 based upon the number of metastatic nodes 
involved. As a result there are now four pathologic Stage III groups rather than three, and as such the 
new classifications for stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC now include different criteria for T (size of the tumours) 
and N (number of nodes involved) and as a result are not identical as to the same groups that were 
used for the staging for the entry criteria into the to the same trial CA209238 (Figure 1).

Adjuvant Treatments for Stage III and Stage IV Resectable Melanoma 
To reduce the risk of relapse, Stage III and IV patients are candidates for adjuvant treatment after 
complete surgical treatment which has removed all detectable disease. Currently, there are limited 
adjuvant treatment options for Stage III and Stage IV resectable melanoma. Standard treatment 
described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) guidelines include interferon-α, pegylated interferon therapy and ipilimumab. 
Although ipilimumab is recommended as adjuvant treatment in the ESMO guideline, ipilimumab is not 
approved for adjuvant treatment of melanoma in the EU. The standard of care after complete surgical 
resection differs per EU country. Observation of the lesions and low dose interferon are both used as 
standard of care in the EU 4. 
Interferon-α 
High-dose interferon-α (IFNα) is approved in the US and in the EU as adjuvant therapy in patients who 
are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic recurrence, e.g., patients with primary 
or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.  A recent meta-analysis involving 
fifteen trials showed that EFS was significantly improved with IFN-α (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, CI 
0.81-0.91; P < 0.00001), as was OS (HR = 0.90, CI 0.85-0.97; P = 0.003). The absolute differences 
in EFS at 5 and 10 years were 3.5% and 2.7%, and for OS were 3.0% and 2.8% respectively in favour

of IFN-α with specifically patients with ulcerated tumours obtaining benefit from IFN-α  5. However, the 
size of interferon benefit in terms of disease-free survival and OS is relatively small given the toxicities 
observed, including acute constitutional symptoms, chronic fatigue, myelosuppression, and neurologic 
and psychologic effects.  
Pegylated Interferon 
Pegylated IFNα was developed to decrease the frequency with which IFNα is administered while 
maintaining high exposure levels. The efficacy is similar to high dose IFNα, but a higher percentage of 
patients receiving PEG-IFN discontinued treatment due to toxicity. 
Ipilimumab 
Ipilimumab, a fully human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, is approved for the 
treatment of metastatic melanoma in the EU. However, ipilimumab is not approved for the adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma. It is approved in the US for this indication based on a clinical trial EORTC 
18071 (CA184029) that showed positive efficacy OS data based on the 10 mg/kg schedule in patients 
with Stage III disease. In the placebo controlled trial with stage III melanoma patients (IIIA 20%, IIIB 
44% and IIIC 36%) the RFS was significantly better with ipilimumab compared with placebo (five-year 
RFS 40.8 versus 30.3 percent, HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.89) and the median RFS for ipilimumab was 
27.6 months (95% CI 19.3-37.2) versus 17.1 months (95% CI 13.6-216) placebo6,7. Also, DMFS was 
significantly better with ipilimumab compared with placebo (five-year DMFS 48.3 versus 38.9 percent, 
HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.92) as well as overall survival (five-year overall survival 65.4 versus 54.4 
percent, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, p = 0.001). This benefit was seen despite the use of various 
systemic therapies in patients who subsequently developed recurrent disease.  
The dose of ipilimumab used in the adjuvant EORTC 18071 trial was 10 mg/kg, which is different than 
the dose approved to treat metastatic melanoma (3 mg/kg). There is evidence that 10 mg/kg is 
associated with increased toxicity.8 Toxicity associated with adjuvant ipilimumab was significant. 
Adverse events of any grade were observed in 98.7% of patients treated with ipilimumab, including 
54.1% with grade 3 or 4 adverse events (compared to 91.1% and 26.2% for placebo respectively). 
The most common Grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in the ipilimumab arm (and 
placebo arm) were gastrointestinal (16.1% vs 0.8%), hepatic (10.8% vs 0.2%), and endocrine (7.9% 
vs 0.2%). 53.3% of subjects discontinued treatment with ipilimumab due to AEs (51.0% due to drug-
related AEs). The overall types of events were consistent with those observed in advanced melanoma. 
However, the rate of adverse events with ipilimumab in the context of adjuvant therapy is higher than 
that observed with the same dose in a pooled analysis involving patients with advanced 
melanoma9, 10, 11. Treatment-related deaths in patients treated with ipilimumab were due to colitis, 
myocarditis, and multi-organ failure associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Quality of life was 
assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0 (QLQ-C30). There was a 
statistically significant decrease in global health status both during and after induction therapy, but the

difference did not exceed the clinically relevant threshold of 10 points (difference in means of 
approximately -4 when comparing ipilimumab to placebo)12. 
Adjuvant treatments under investigation 
Low-dose (3mg/kg) Ipilimumab  
A phase III trial in the adjuvant setting compared ipilimumab at two different doses (the 10 mg/kg 
dose or 3 mg/kg dose) with high-dose IFN (E-1609, NCT01274338). An unplanned exploratory analysis 
based on a 3.1 year follow-up of 773 concurrently randomized patients showed that toxicity was lower 
with the 3 mg/kg schedule compared with the 10 mg/kg schedule (all grade 3-4 adverse events 36.6% 
versus 56.5% and grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events 18.8% versus 34.0%). Moreover, there 
was no difference in the three-year RFS (42.3 and 42.6 percent, respectively, HR 1.0), but longer 
follow-up is required. 
Dabrafenib plus trametinib (BRAF V600 mutation only): In a phase III trial, 870 patients with 
completely resected BRAF V600 mutation-positive stage III melanoma were randomly assigned to the 
combination of dabrafenib (150 mg twice a day) plus trametinib (2 mg once a day) or to matching 
placebos for 12 months13 . The median follow-up was 2.8 years, with a minimum 2.5 years. Relapse-
free survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, was significantly longer with dabrafenib plus trametinib 
compared with placebo (three-year rate 58% versus 39%, HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39-0.58). At the time of 
analysis, median RFS had not yet been reached in the combination-therapy group (95% CI, 44.5 
months to not reached) and was 16.6 months (95% Ci, 12.7 to 22.1) in the placebo group. Overall 
survival, while not statistically significant, was prolonged with the targeted therapy (three-year rate 
86% versus 77%, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.79). The safety profile of the combination therapy was 
consistent with that observed in patients with metastatic melanoma.  
Vemurafenib (BRAF V600E mutation only): BRIM8 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
2-cohort study that placed 498 adult patients with fully resected stage IIC, IIIA, or IIIB melanoma into 
cohort 1 and patients with stage IIIC melanoma to cohort 2. Both cohorts were randomly assigned to 
vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily or placebo for 52 weeks14 . In cohort 2 no significant improvements 
in DFS and Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were detected. In contrast, in cohort 1, substantial 
improvement in DFS was seen when comparing adjuvant vemurafenib (28.7% events) versus placebo 
(45.9% events). The median time to event was ‘not estimated’ for vemurafenib versus 36.9 months 
for placebo (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37, 0.78 (p = 0.0010)). Overall, the safety profile of adjuvant 
vemurafenib was consistent with previous data and no new safety signals were observed. 
Pembrolizumab: A phase III trial comparing pembrolizumab with placebo has completed accrual for 
patients with high-risk stage III melanoma following complete resection (NCT02362594). At a median 
follow-up of 15 months, pembrolizumab showed a RFS benefit over placebo (1-year rate of recurrence-
free survival, 75.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 71.3 to 78.9] vs. 61.0% [95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1]; 
hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to 0.74; P<0.001)15.  
In addition, a phase III cooperative group trial (NCT02506153, Southwest Oncology Group S1404) 
comparing pembrolizumab with high-dose interferon or high-dose ipilimumab is ongoing in patients 
with high-risk stage III or IVA disease following complete resection.

About the application: 
The current submission concerns the extension of the indication for nivolumab monotherapy for the 
adjuvant treatment of adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older with completely 
resected Stage III and IV melanoma. The recommended dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy 
is the same as that approved for melanoma, NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma monotherapy: 3 mg/kg 
IV infusion over 60 minutes Q2W. Treatment duration is until disease recurrence or unacceptable 
toxicity for up to 1 year. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older with completely resected Stage III and IV melanoma.” 
The final agreed indication is as follows: 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with melanoma with 
involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection (see 
section 5.1).” 
The recommended dose of OPDIVO is 3 mg/kg nivolumab administered intravenously over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks. 
For adjuvant therapy, the maximum treatment duration with OPDIVO is 12 months. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided a justification for not performing an environmental risk assessment. As 
nivolumab is a protein composed of natural amino acids, proteins are expected to biodegrade in the 
environment and not pose a significant risk. Therefore, nivolumab is exempt from preparation of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as per the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nivolumab and the product excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical data is acceptable as the indication relates to the same disease as the 
approved indication. The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of nivolumab. Considering the above data, 
nivolumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nivolumab clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, 
drug-drug interaction potential, QT prolongation potential, and dose selection for phase 2/3 studies has 
been well characterized previously in the initial marketing authorization dossier. 
The basis of this submission is the phase 3 study CA209238, in which nivolumab 3 mg/kg as adjuvant 
therapy was compared with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with the primary endpoint of RFS in subjects with 
completely resected Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV melanoma. An updated popPK analysis and 
immunogenicity results from study CA209238 is presented.  
-Pharmacokinetics – popPK analysis 
The popPK analysis included in this submission focused on the evaluation of adjuvant treatment of 
melanoma versus treatment of advanced melanoma. The popPK analysis performed to support this 
submission characterized the PK of nivolumab in 1773 subjects with solid tumours, including advanced 
melanoma (N=565) and in the setting of adjuvant treatment of melanoma (N=448). Data from the 
following studies were included in the current popPK analysis (MDX1106-01, MDX1106-03, ONO4538-
01 (multiple tumour types), CA209017, CA209057, CA209063 (NSCLC), ONO-4538-02, CA209037, 
CA209066 (advanced melanoma), and CA209238 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma). Sparse data 
sampling was conducted in study CA209238 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma): week 1 day1 and 
week 7 day 1 pre-dose and end-of-infusion, week 13, 23, and 35 pre-dose.  
The PK of nivolumab in subjects with solid tumours and cHL was previously characterized by a popPK 
analysis where nivolumab PK was described initially by a stationary model, in which nivolumab CL was 
constant with respect to time, and then by a time-varying CL model.  
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 14/92 
 
  
  
 
The Final Model was a two-compartment, zero-order IV infusion with stationary CL for the setting of 
adjuvant treatment of melanoma and time-varying CL (sigmoidal-Emax function) for advanced 
melanoma, NCSLC 2L+ and the other tumour types. The model included a proportional residual error 
model, with random effect on CL, VC, VP and Emax and correlation of random effect between CL and 
VC. The final model also contained baseline BWT, eGFR, PS, sex, race and tumour type on CL and 
baseline BWT and sex on VC. Baseline covariates were incorporated into the final model using 
functional relationships. 
The geometric mean baseline CL for advanced melanoma was 10.6 mL/h (after the first dose) and 
reached a steady-state value of 7.94 mL/h (Table 2). Table 1 shows that the geometric mean CL for in 
the setting of adjuvant treatment of melanoma was constant at 6 mL/h. The percent difference in CL at 
baseline between adjuvant treatment of melanoma and advanced melanoma was approximately 40%, 
and over time the percent difference decreased to approximately 20% at steady state.

Table 3 shows that subjects with adjuvant treatment of melanoma had a range of 13% to 45% higher 
predicted dose-normalized exposures relative to the advanced melanoma subjects across exposure 
measures (after the first dose and at steady state).

In addition to including tumour type in the popPK model, the model also included effects of baseline 
body weight, baseline eGFR, performance status, sex, and race on CL; and baseline body weight and 
sex on VC. These covariates were from the previously established popPK model, and were included in 
this analysis to describe nivolumab concentration-time data in subjects upon adjuvant treatment of 
melanoma.

2.3.3.  Immunogenicity 
The incidence of immunogenicity was 2.3% (10/426 subjects) following nivolumab monotherapy. 
Three subjects (0.7%) were persistent positive in the nivolumab group. No subjects were neutralizing 
ADA (NAb) positive following nivolumab administration.  
In an analysis of selected AEs (hypersensitivity/infusion reaction), nivolumab ADA occurrence did not 
seem to have an impact on safety: of the 13 subjects with a selected adverse event of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction, only 1/10 nivolumab ADA positive subjects and 12/416 nivolumab 
ADA negative subjects in the nivolumab group experienced AEs in the hypersensitivity/infusion 
reaction category. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic data were collected in Study CA209238. Based on popPK analysis, clearance (CL) of 
nivolumab was lower in subjects with adjuvant treatment of melanoma (6 ml/h) compared to advanced 
melanoma subjects (10.6 ml/h) and this did not vary over time. Hence, nivolumab exposure (Cave) at 
steady-state was approximately 40% higher in subjects with adjuvant treatment of melanoma 
compared to advanced melanoma. The lower and constant CL for subjects with adjuvant treatment of 
melanoma is consistent with the previous hypothesis that nivolumab CL is related to disease state. 
Patients suitable for adjuvant treatment are relatively healthier than advanced melanoma subjects as 
the first population is considered disease-free prior to randomization for treatment. In advanced 
melanoma, a decrease in nivolumab CL following treatment was mostly observed in patients with a CR 
and PR, hence in patients in which disease burden decreases. In CA209238, the performance status of 
the subjects at baseline was 0 for 91% of the subjects as compared to 64% in advanced melanoma 
subjects. Therefore, the stationary CL in resected melanoma fits previous observations. Similar to prior 
analyses, nivolumab CL increased with an increase in baseline body weight and baseline eGFR; and 
was higher in subjects with PS>0, and in males. Sex, race, and renal function were not clinically 
relevant predictors of nivolumab clearance (< 20% effect). 
The absence of exposure response analysis for efficacy and safety in subjects in the adjuvant 
treatment setting of melanoma has been sufficiently justified. Previous exposure-response 
relationships had shown that Cavg,ss was not a significant predictor of death after accounting for 
nivolumab CL. As in clinical pharmacology studies in the adjuvant treatment setting of melanoma only 
one nivolumab dose was administered, relationships with Cavg,ss are confounded by nivolumab CL. 
Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in several other tumour types 
and previous analyses in advanced melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC patients have shown that AE-DC/D 
does not increase with Cavg,ss following nivolumab doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W. The safety profile 
seems acceptable even though nivolumab exposure was approximately 40% higher in resected 
melanoma subjects with adjuvant treatment compared to advanced melanoma (see clinical safety).  
Incidence of immunogenicity was low (2.3%) in subjects following melanoma resection and adjuvant 
nivolumab treatment compared to approximately 11% ADA incidence in other tumour types. Subjects 
with nivolumab ADA continued treatment with clinical benefit from therapy, and there was no trend for 
presence of ADA to be associated with a reduction in efficacy. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic aspects of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for the adjuvant treatment of 
melanoma are considered to have been sufficiently well characterised. Nivolumab exposure was 
approximately 40% higher in patients with adjuvant melanoma compared to advanced melanoma. 
With available safety data, this higher nivolumab exposure was not clinically meaningful.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W) was based upon the analyses of 
safety, efficacy, and exposure-response data from 306 subjects treated with nivolumab Q2W in the 
Phase 1 dose-ranging study CA209003. 
The ipilimumab dose regimen of 10 mg/kg Q3W x 4 doses evaluated in this study was chosen based 
upon an analysis of data from 475 subjects randomized (471 treated) with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg Q3W 
in the Phase 3 study EORTC 18071 (CA184029), which showed an recurrence free survival (RFS) 
advantage of ipilimumab over placebo. After the initial four doses (induction) of ipilimumab, additional 
therapy (maintenance) was added based on the theoretical principles of continued re-stimulation of the 
immune system, consistent with previous studies of immunotherapy in the adjuvant treatment setting 
of melanoma. However, in study CA209238 the dosing duration was capped at 1 year due to the fact 
very few subjects received ipilimumab beyond 1 year in the EORTC 18071 study.

ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint 
pathways) are not eligible. 
i) 
Prior treatment with adjuvant interferon is allowed if completed ≥ 6 months 
prior to randomization. 
Treatments 
In subjects randomized to the nivolumab group, nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered as a 60-minute 
intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks (Q2W). In subjects randomized to the ipilimumab group, 
ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was administered as a 90-minute IV infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) x 4 doses, 
then 10 mg/kg IV Q 12 weeks starting at Week 24.  
First dose must be administered within 3 business days following randomization. When study drugs 
(ipilimumab or nivolumab) or matched placebos are to be administered on the same day, separate 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 20/92 
 
  
  
infusion bags and filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab or nivolumab-placebo is to be 
administered first.  
The second infusion will always be the ipilimumab or ipilimumab-placebo study drug, and will start no 
sooner than 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab or nivolumab-placebo infusion. 
Subjects may be dosed up to ± 3 days before or after the scheduled date if necessary. There should be 
a minimum of 12 days between 2 nivolumab/nivolumab-placebo administrations. For dosing visits of 
Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48, subjects may be dosed up to ± 7 days. 
Dose reductions and dose delays were not permitted for nivolumab and ipilimumab. Doses of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab were to be omitted (instead of delayed) based on specific criteria, such as 
any Grade 2 non-skin drug related adverse events, any grade 3 skin, drug-related event, any grade 3 
drug-related laboratory abnormality or any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent 
illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants omitting the dose of study medication. If 
the criteria to resume treatment are met within the dosing window (Day 1, Week X ± 3 days, Week 
24, Week 36 and Week 48 ± 7 days), then the dose may be given.  
Subjects must discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the discretion of 
the investigator) for any of the following reasons: 
•  Subject’s request to stop study treatment 
•  Recurrence (local, regional or distant) 
•  Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best 
interest of the subject 
Termination of the study by the MAH 
Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration for 
treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness 
• 
• 
•  Unblinding a subject for any reason (emergency or non-emergency) 
All subjects who discontinue study drug should comply with protocol specified follow-up procedure. If 
study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
Recurrence Free Survival (RFS): RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomisation and 
the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death 
(whatever the cause), whichever occurs first. Subjects will be assessed for recurrence (until local, 
regional, or distant recurrence (whichever comes first) for Stage IV subjects and until distant 
recurrence for Stage III subjects) by CT or MRI as follows: 
1.  Screening 
2.  Treatment Period: Every 12 weeks (± 7 days) from first dose of study drug through 12 months 
(relative to the first dose of study drug) 
3.  Follow-up Period: 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 22/92 
 
  
  
a) Every 12 weeks (± 7 days) through 12 months for subjects who discontinued early from 
treatment (relative to the first dose of study drug) 
b) Every 12 weeks (± 14 days) if > 12 months through 24 months (relative to the first dose of 
study drug) 
c) Every 6 months (± 4 weeks) if > 24 months through and up to Year 5 (relative to the first 
dose of study drug) 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  AEs, SAEs, deaths, laboratory abnormalities: Safety and tolerability were measured by the 
incidence of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and laboratory abnormalities. 
Analyses were conducted using the 30-day and 100-day safety window from day of last dose 
received. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version 20.0. AEs and laboratory values were graded for severity according to the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. 
•  RFS endpoint by PD-L1: The PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 28-8 pharmDx assay co-
developed by BMS and DAKO North America (Carpinteria, CA US) using a rabbit anti-human 
PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8; Epitomics Inc, Burlingame, CA US) was used to assess PD-L1 
expression in tumour samples. PD-L1 expression missing: no available tumour biopsy 
specimen for PD-L1 evaluation. PD-L1 expression: the percent of tumour cells demonstrating 
plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of any intensity in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells 
using the Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. Quantifiable: an available tumour biopsy 
specimen and the number of viable tumour cells is ≥ 100 and percentage of tumour PD-L1 
expression is ≥ 0%. Indeterminate: tumour cell membrane staining hampered for reasons 
attributed to the biology of the tumour biopsy specimen and not because of improper sample 
preparation or handling. Not evaluable: tumour biopsy specimen was not optimally collected or 
prepared (eg, PD-L1 expression is neither quantifiable nor indeterminate). 
•  HRQoL/QLQ-C30: The QLQ-C30 (Version 3) has 30 items divided among 5 functional scales 
(physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and 
vomiting, and pain), a global health status/quality of life scale, and 6 single-item scales 
(dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties). Two item 
measuring overall health status and quality of life are graded on a 7-point Likert scale, while all 
remaining items are graded on a 4-point scale: 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). 
Exploratory Endpoints 
•  AEs leading to discontinuation and dose modification, select AEs, IMAEs, and other events of 
special interest: Safety and tolerability was further measured by the incidence of AEs leading 
to discontinuation, AEs leading to dose modification, select AEs, immune-mediated AEs 
(IMAEs), and other events of special interest. Select AE analyses included incidence, time-to-
onset, and time-to-resolution. 
•  DMFS: DMFS was programmatically determined based on the first date of distant metastasis 
provided by the investigator and was defined as the time between the date of randomization 
and the date of first distant metastasis or death (whatever the cause) whichever occurred first.  
•  RFS, DMFS, and OS: Consistency of treatment effects in BRAF mutation status (BRAF mutant, 
BRAF wildtype) and RFS and DMFS (a forest plot of RFS and DMFS un-stratified hazard ratio 
and 95% confidence interval (CI) were produced). To evaluate associations between BRAF 
mutation status and clinical efficacy (RFS, DMFS and OS not included in this Interim CSR). 
•  Serum ADA and neutralizing ADA response to nivolumab and ipilimumab: Human serum 
samples from nivolumab- and ipilimumab-treated subjects were evaluated for the presence of 
ADA at PPD Inc. (Richmond, VA) using validated immunoassay methods (Method ICDIM 140 
and Method ICDIM 14)6,7 and neutralizing activity at BMS (Princeton NJ) using validated 
functional cell-based assays (Method 15400 and Method 15818).

• 
EQ-5D responses: The EQ-5D descriptive system is comprised of the following 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension 
has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and severe health problems. The EQ-5D visual 
analog scale (VAS) recorded the subject’s self-rated health state on a 100-point vertical VAS (0 
= worst imaginable health state; 100 = best imaginable health state). 
•  WPAI:GH: The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire: General Health 
(WPAI:GH) is a patient-reported quantitative assessment 6-item questionnaire yielding 4 
different types of scores: percent work time missed due to health, percent impairment while 
working due to health, percent overall work impairment due to health and percent activity 
impairment due to health. 
Sample size 
The primary objective of the study was to compare RFS between the treatment arms in all randomised 
subjects. The sample size was calculated to compare RFS between subjects randomised to receive 
nivolumab vs. ipilimumab. RFS was evaluated for a treatment effect at an overall alpha level of 0.05 
(two-sided) with approximately 85% power. The number of events and power were calculated 
assuming a delayed treatment effect and cure fraction. Approximately 800 subjects total were to be 
randomised to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Taking into account the actual AJCC disease 
stage distribution (about 80% of Stage III subjects and 20% of Stage IV subjects), higher cure rates, 
and some early drop-out, the original planned 507 events might not be reached by the final RFS 
analysis. Therefore, approximately 450 RFS events were anticipated at the final RFS analysis, ensuring 
at least 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 with an overall type I error of 0.05 (two-sided). An 
interim analysis of RFS was added via protocol amendment 4 months before execution to take place 
after all subjects had a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. Approximately 350 RFS events were 
anticipated at this analysis. The stopping boundary at the interim analysis is derived based on the 
exact number of RFS events using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries.  
Randomisation 
After initial eligibility was established and the informed consent obtained, subjects were enrolled into 
the study via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). In order to be randomized, a subject must 
have had a PD-L1 expression classification (positive, negative or indeterminate) as determined by the 
Central Laboratory. PD-L1 status (positive [based on 5% level] vs negative/indeterminate) was used 
as a stratification factor. 
Once enrolled in the IVRS, subjects who met all eligibility criteria were randomized by IVRS in a 1:1 
ratio to the nivolumab group or the ipilimumab group. Using a permuted block design, with 
stratification by PD-L1 status (the result of PD-L1 positive vs PD-L1 negative/indeterminate was 
entered by the central laboratory vendor and both the site and the BMS study team remained blinded 
to the result) and disease stage (Stage Stage IIIb/c, Stage IV M1a-M1b or Stage IV M1c) at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blinded study. Upon recurrence of disease and treatment discontinuation of each 
subject, investigators may be unblinded to the subject’s treatment assignment via the Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS) to inform the appropriate subsequent treatment. The Sponsor’s central 
protocol team will remain blinded to treatment assignment.  
The randomization call was performed by the unblinded pharmacy site staff.

Statistical methods 
Discrete variables were tabulated by the frequency and proportion of subjects falling into each 
category, grouped by treatment. Continuous variables were summarized by treatment using the mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. Time to event distributions were 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier techniques. This was done for endpoints of RFS and DMFS. Median 
survival times, along with 95% CIs, were constructed based on a log-log transformed CI for the 
survivor function S(t). Rates at fixed time points were derived from the Kaplan-Meier estimate and 
corresponding confidence interval were derived based on Greenwood formula for variance derivation 
and on log-log transformation applied on the survivor function S(t). Analyses were conducted using a 
two-sided log-rank test stratified by PD-L1 status and Stage at screening in randomized subjects. The 
hazard ratio of nivolumab to ipilimumab, and its associated CI, were obtained by fitting a stratified Cox 
model with the treatment group variable as the sole covariate using stratification factor information 
recorded in the IVRS. 
The primary RFS analyses were conducted using a two-sided log-rank test stratified by PD-L1 status 
and Stage at screening in randomized subjects. The hazard ratio and corresponding two sided 97.56 % 
CI (adjusted for the interim analysis) was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, with 
treatment group as a single covariate, stratified by the above factors. To evaluate PD-L1 expression as 
a predictive biomarker, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test the interaction between PD-
L1 expression (positive vs negative) and treatment arm for the RFS endpoint. Additionally, RFS was 
analysed within each PD-L1 expression subgroup (positive and negative) including hazard ratios with 
corresponding confidence intervals. These analyses were descriptive and not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Multiplicity if RFS will be statistically significant (at the RFS interim with minimum 18 months follow-
up, added via protocol amendment 18, or at the original RFS final analysis with minimum 36 months), 
OS will be tested at the OS interim which is at the time of the final RFS analysis (minimum 36 months 
follow-up) or at the OS final analysis with a minimum of 48 months follow-up. Separate Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending functions with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries for RFS and OS will be used. 
Censoring rules for RFS 
Figure 5: 
Censoring Scheme for Primary Definition RFS 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 25/92 
 
  
  
 
Censoring rules for DMFS 
A subject who had disease at baseline was considered to have an event on the day of randomisation. A 
subject who died without reported distant metastasis was considered to have had distant metastasis 
on the date of death. For subjects who remained alive and distant metastasis-free, DMFS was censored 
on the date of last evaluable disease assessment. For those subjects who remained alive and had no 
recorded post-randomization disease assessment, DMFS was censored on the day of randomization. 
Sensitivity analyses for RFS 
The sensitivity analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method, stratified Cox proportional hazards model, and 
stratified log-rank test included: 
•  Unstratified RFS 
•  RFS stratified by PD-L1 status and disease stage per eCRF/clinical database (instead of IVRS, 
primary analysis) 
•  RFS accounting for assessment on/after subsequent therapy or on/after second non-melanoma 
primary cancer 
•  RFS accounting for missing disease assessment prior to RFS event 
•  RFS accounting for subjects lost to follow-up 
•  RFS for subjects with no relevant deviations 
One of the sensitivity analyses of RFS (‘RFS accounting for assessment on/after subsequent therapy or 
on/after second non-melanoma primary cancer’) will investigate the first RFS event without censoring 
for subsequent therapy or non-melanoma primary cancer. Other sensitivity analyses investigated the 
impact of stratification based on CRF instead of IVRS, of not stratifying, of having a relevant protocol 
deviation, of missing >2 visits, and of lost-to-follow up. 
Overall Survival 
Per protocol, the first OS analysis (formal interim analysis) will take place when all subjects have a 
minimum follow-up of 3 years (ie, LPLV of Nov-2018) and the final OS analysis will be performed 4 
years after last patient randomisation. 
PFS2 
An evaluation on PFS2 was conducted based on the evaluation of data collected on outcomes at the 
end of next line treatment. Progression-free survival on next line systemic therapy was defined as time 
from randomization to the earliest event which is either end date of next-line subsequent systemic 
therapy OR death from any cause, and to last known alive date in case of no event (ie, censor) 
meaning either (1) no subsequent systemic therapy and no death OR (2) subsequent systemic therapy 
but no end date available and no death.

906 subjects were randomized at 130 sites in 25 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, 
Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, 
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United 
Kingdom, and the United States of America); Of the 906 randomized subjects, 523 (57.7%) were in 
Europe, 257 (28.4%) were in North America, and 126 (13.9%) were in Rest of World. 
Of the 906 subjects randomized (453 to nivolumab, 453 to ipilimumab), 905 (99.9%) were treated 
(452 with nivolumab, 453 with ipilimumab). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 11-Nov-2014. Six global amendments and 12 country-
specific amendments were issued for this study, and are summarized in Table 4. In addition, 1 
administrative letter was issued for this study (21-Jan-2015) included a clarification that survival 
follow-up visit should take place 3 months after Follow-up Visit 2.

Protocol deviations 
Relevant protocol deviations (significant protocol deviations that could potentially affect the 
interpretability of study results) were reported in 3.6% of subjects (2.6% nivolumab and 4.6% 
ipilimumab) see Table 5. The most common relevant protocol deviation at study entry was that the last 
intervention demonstrating the subjects was free of disease was more than 13 weeks prior to 
randomisation, affecting 0.9% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 2.6% of subjects in the 
ipilimumab group. 
The most common relevant protocol deviation during the treatment period was receipt of concurrent 
anti-cancer therapy, affecting 3 (0.7%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 3 (0.7%) subjects in the 
ipilimumab group. 
Relevant protocol deviations were predefined in the SAP.

Numbers analysed 
The all-randomized population was the primary population used for the primary efficacy analysis and 
the all-treated population was the primary population for safety analyses. A description of the analysis

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint – Recurrence-free Survival 
As of the data cut-off for this interim analysis, 360 of the planned 450 RFS evens (80% information 
fraction) has occurred. The critical hazard ratio for 80% information fraction is 0.78 and p< 0.0244 
(two-sided) was needed for statistical significance at this interim. At the time of the database lock, 299 
(66.0%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 247 (54.5%) subjects in the ipilimumab group were 
censored. Among those censored, none were still on treatment, and most were in follow-up (286 
[63.1%] in the nivolumab group and 215 [47.5%] in the ipilimumab group. 
The primary analysis in all randomized subjects demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in 
RFS with nivolumab compared to ipilimumab with HR of 0.65 (97.56% CI: 0.51,0.83; stratified log-
rank p < 0.0001) in completely resected Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV melanoma.

Randomized Subjects) 
Minimum follow-up (last subject’s last randomization date of 30-Nov-2015 to clinical cut-off date of 15-
May-2017) for all randomized subjects was approximately 18 months. Time from last disease 
assessment date to clinical data cut-off date (ie, currentness of follow-up) was within 3 months for 431 
(95.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 418 (92.3%) subjects in the ipilimumab group. 2.2% of 
the patient in the ipilimumab group had a currentness of follow-up of ≥18 months and <24 months, 
compared to 0.9% in the nivolumab group. 
Recurrence Free Survival - Updated analyses with a minimal follow-up of 24 months 
The  following  analyses  are  based  on  approximately  6  months  additional  follow-up,  ie,  a  minimum 
follow-up of about 24 months. The number of RFS events increased from 154 to 171 in the nivoluamab 
group (an increase with 17 events) and from 206 to 221 in the ipilimumab group (an increase with 15 
events). 
The  updated  analyses  show  a  median  RFS  of  30.75  months  for  nivolumab  vs  24.08  months  for 
ipilimumab HR = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.81]. It should be noted that the median provided is unstable 
due to low number of patients and censoring with 24 months of follow-up.

Secondary efficacy endpoint – Baseline PD-L1 Expression and RFS 
As of database lock, 452/453 randomized subjects in the nivolumab group had a tumour tissue sample 
collected at baseline and 453/453 subjects in the ipilimumab group. 67.9% of  the samples in the 
nivolumab group came from a metastatic site compared to 77.7% of the ipilimumab group.  The 
majority of the metastatic samples was derived from the lymph nodes. 867 (95.7%) had quantifiable 
PD-L1 expression and 38 (4.2%) did not have quantifiable PD-L1 expression (all 38 subjects were 
indeterminate, 37 due to high melanin content and 1 due to high background). The proportion of 
subjects with quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline was similar between the nivolumab (94.3%)

and ipilimumab (97.1%) groups. Almost all subjects (99.1%) had a tumour specimen in which immune 
cells were present (99.5% nivolumab and 98.6% ipilimumab). 
An analysis of the risk of recurrence for nivolumab vs ipilimumab at all pre-defined expression levels of 
≥1%, ≥5%, and 10% is shown in Figure 9.  See Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12for RFS Kaplan-
Meier plots using the PD-L1 expression cut-offs of 1%, 5% and 10%. 
The study was not powered to detect interactions, but the p-value for the interaction term was 0.1765 
(cut-off 5%).

Health-related Quality of Life – Secondary and exploratory Endpoints 
EORTC General Cancer Module (QLQ-C30) – secondary endpoint 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is the most commonly used quality-of-life instrument in oncology trials. The 
instrument’s 30 items are divided among 5 functional scales, and a global health/quality of life scale. 
Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher scores for all 
functional scales and Global Health Status indicate better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates 
improvement in HRQoL compared to baseline. A difference of 10 points on a 100 point scale between 
the two treatment arms is considered clinically relevant, based on the work of Osoba et al (Osoba, 
1998).  
Questionnaire completion rates at baseline were 97.8% (443/453) in the nivolumab group and 96.0% 
(435/453) in the ipilimumab group. Calculated as a percentage of subjects on study or in follow-up, 
completion rates for the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups met or exceeded 86.4% and 84.0%, 
respectively, at all assessments through 49 weeks. Completion rates for Follow-up Visits 1 and 2 for 
the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups met or exceeded 76.3% and 71.7%, respectively. 
At baseline, mean EORTC QLQ-C30 summary scores for All Randomized subjects were comparable 
between treatment groups (no statistical test performed). Quality of life through Week 49 as measured 
by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status  (as well as for the individual functioning or symptom 
scales) remained stable in both treatment groups, with no mean change score from baseline reaching 
the minimal important difference for the patient (i.e. mean change ≥10 points) at any time point for 
either treatment group.  
Patient-reported General Health Status (EQ-5D) 
The EQ-5D-3L5 is a generic multi-attribute health-state classification system. The respondent’s self-
described health state can be converted into a utility score representing the societal desirability of 
his/her own health. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a VAS allowing a respondent to rate his/her health 
on a scale ranging from 0–100, with a MCID for mean change score from baseline of 0.08 for the EQ 
5D utility score and of 7 for the EQ 5D VAS (Pickard, 2007). 
Questionnaire completion rates for the EQ-5D at baseline were 98.0% (444/453) of subjects in the 
nivolumab group and 96.9% (439/453) of subjects in the ipilimumab group completed the EQ-5D and 
met or exceeded 86% and 85%, respectively, at all assessments through 49 weeks of follow up, and 
met or exceeded 77.2 and 73.5 at follow-up visits.  
At baseline, mean EQ-5D utility index scores and EQ-5D VAS for All Randomized subjects were 
comparable between treatment groups (no statistical test performed). The EQ-5D utility index scores 
and EQ-5D VAS remained stable in both treatment groups, with no mean change score from baseline 
reaching the MID for the patient at any time point for either treatment group. 
WPAI:GH - Exploratory Endpoint 
The WPAI:GH is a six-item questionnaire yielding four different scale scores. The questionnaire was 
created as a patient-reported quantitative assessment of the amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, 
work productivity and daily activity impairment attributable to general health. WPAI outcomes are 
expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less 
productivity. WPAI:GH does not have an MIC established yet. Currently, one-half the standard 
deviation (SD) of scores at baseline was used as an estimate of MID for each of the WPAI:GH scales. 
Questionnaire completion rates at baseline were 93.2% (422/453) in the nivolumab group and 94.3% 
(427/453) in the ipilimumab group. Calculated as a percentage of subjects on study or in follow-up, 
completion rates for the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups met or exceeded 83.8% and 80.8%, 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 41/92 
 
  
  
respectively, at all assessments through 49 weeks, and met or exceeded 74% and 69.8% at follow-up 
visits. 
At baseline, mean WPAI:GH summary scale scores for All Randomized subjects were comparable 
between treatment groups (no statistical tests). Considering one-half of the standard deviation at 
baseline no clinically meaningful deterioration or improvement was observed at any time point for 
either treatment group for any scale.  
Ancillary analyses 
RFS in pre-defined subsets 
The unstratified HRs for RFS favoured nivolumab over ipilimumab in pre-defined subgroups, with the 
exception of the small subgroup of subjects with mucosal melanoma (nivolumab group n = 16 and 
ipilimumab group n = 13), Stage IV M1c (nivolumab group n = 20 and ipilimumab group n = 21), and 
ulceration present plus microscopic lymph node involvement (nivolumab group n = 66 and ipilimumab

DMFS in Subgroup Analyses 
The unstratified HRs for DMFS favoured nivolumab over ipilimumab in pre-defined subgroups among 
most of the randomised subjects with Stage III disease, with the exception of 4 subgroups. The 2 
smaller subsets including patients with mucosal melanoma (HR 2.36; 95% CI: 0.62, 8.90;  n = 15 in 
the nivolumab group and n = 11 in the ipilimumab group) and subjects from Eastern Europe (HR 0.87; 
95% CI: 0.26, 2.84;  nivolumab n = 35, ipilimumab n = 17) had wide CIs that encompassed 1.0. In 
addition, the analyses of the ulceration present plus microscopic lymph node involvement (HR 1.03; 
95% CI: 0.57, 1.88;  nivolumab group n = 66 and ipilimumab group n = 69) and PD-L1 status < 1%/ 
Indeterminate (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.43; nivolumab n = 133, ipilimumab n = 118) also had wide 
CIs that encompassed 1.0. 
OS 
At the time of the present database lock (December 2017), only 111 deaths have occurred (about 37% 
of the protocol-expected number of deaths). These data are immature and prevent definitive 
conclusions.

Reclassification of disease staging according to the new AJCC 8th edition 
In a pre-defined subgroup analyses for patients with nonulcerated, micrometastatic disease (n=119), 
nivolumab had an HR of 0.52 vs. ipilimumab. In the AJCC 7th edition, many of these patients would 
have been considered Stage IIIb solely based on a mitotic rate ≥1/mm2, whereas in the AJCC 8th 
edition staging would be IIIa as mitotic rate is no longer a T staging criteria. Patients who met with the 
criteria of 4 or more metastatic nodes or matted nodes would be excluded from the 119 patients since 
such patients are considered stage IIIc/IIId. 
Figure 21:  
Forest Plot of treatment on updated Recurrence-Free Survival in pre-defined 
subsets - Study CA209238 (All Randomised Subjects) 
Patients with non-ulcerated, micrometastatic disease who were defined as Stage IIIb subjects per 
AJCC 7th Edition would be considered Stage IIIa subjects per AJCC 8th Edition. For these subjects 
(N=43), the HR of nivolumab over ipilimumab was 0.61  based on June 2017 database lock with a 
minimum follow-up of 18 months. With a minimum follow-up of 24 months, one more subject in the 
ipilimumab group had an event and the HR of nivolumab over ipilimumab was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.13, 
1.85).

RFS for PD-L1 expression by site of origin  
The impact of sample origin on RFS was analysed for the PDL-1 expression subgroups. There was a 
total of 905/906 randomized subjects that had a tumor tissue sample collected at baseline with the 
majority (72.8%) of samples being from a metastatic site and 23.6% from a primary site. Slightly 
more subjects in the ipilimumab group (77.7%) had tissue collected from a metastatic site compared 
to nivolumab subjects (67.9%). 867 (95.7%) had quantifiable PD-L1 expression and 38 (4.2%) did not 
have quantifiable PD-L1 expression (all 38 subjects were indeterminate, 37 due to high melanin 
content and 1 due to high background). The proportion of subjects with quantifiable PD-L1 expression 
at baseline was similar between the nivolumab (94.3%) and ipilimumab (97.1%) groups.  
RFS results are presented below for all randomised (Primary site and Metastatic site) (Figure 25) and 
by  PD-L1 expression level at cutoff level of 5% (Figure 26 and Figure 27) and cutoff level of 1%

RFS and DMFS by BRAF mutation 
Among all randomized subjects, 381 (42.1%) subjects were BRAF V600 mutation positive, 409 
(45.1%) subjects were BRAF wild type; and for 116 (12.8%) subjects BRAF status was unknown. 
There were 2 subjects who were considered BRAF wildtype in the original analysis that are now 
considered with BRAF mutated. There were 39% of BRAF mutant patients (73/187) with nivolumab 
and 49% (95/194) with ipilimumab with events (HR=0.73; 95%CI (0.54, 0.99) and in BRAF wild type 
patients 37.1% (73/197) with nivolumab and 50.5% (107/212) with ipilimumab had an event 
(HR=0.61; 95%CI (0.45, 0.82).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of patients with 
completely resected melanoma were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study 
Variation assessment report

(CA209238). The study included adult patients, who had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1, 
with Stage IIIB/C or Stage IV American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 7
th
 edition, histologically 
confirmed melanoma that is completely surgically resected. Per the AJCC 8
 edition, this corresponds 
th
to patients with lymph node involvement or metastases. Patients were enrolled regardless of their 
tumour PD-L1 status. Patients with prior autoimmune disease, and any condition requiring systemic 
treatment with either corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other 
immunosuppressive medications, as well as patients with prior therapy for melanoma (except patients 
with surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy after neurosurgical resection for lesions of the central nervous 
system, and prior adjuvant interferon completed ≥6 months prior to randomisation) prior therapy with, 
anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti CTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or any 
other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways), were 
excluded from the study. 
A total of 906 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 453) administered 
every 2 weeks or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (n = 453) administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses then every 
12 weeks beginning at week 24 for up to 1 year. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 
expression (≥ 5% vs. < 5%/indeterminate), and stage of disease per the AJCC staging system. 
Tumour assessments were conducted every 12 weeks for the first 2 years then every 6 months 
thereafter. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RFS, assessed by investigator, 
was defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of first recurrence (local, 
regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurred first. 
In this adjuvant setting, it is not expect that patients are treated until disease progression as many 
patients at low and high risk are cured even without systemic treatment after complete resection. 
Hence, the decision was made to limit the duration of study therapy of both ipilimumab and nivolumab 
for study CA209238 to 1 year maximum duration based on prior experience with immunotherapies ( 
interferon and ipilumumab). This is acceptable as it is possible that the optimal treatment duration 
could be shorter than currently proposed but no further data has been provided to support a shorter 
dosing regimen.  
Ipilimumab, although not approved for adjuvant treatment of melanoma in the EU, was used as the 
comparator for this study. According to the guidelines, the comparator should be the best available, 
evidence-based and widely used treatment and therefore, the comparator is acceptable, considering 
that such active treatments can be used in the EU. In addition, ipilimumab appears to have similar RFS 
rates in trials CA184029 and CA209238 with the 1-year RFS rates of 63.5% and 60.5% respectively, 
which is reassuring from the perspective of consistency of the treatment effect, even taking into 
account that the patient populations are slightly different. 
The use of RFS as primary endpoint is an accepted clinical endpoint for adjuvant treatment in many 
tumour types (eg breast, CRC) and also would apply to melanoma, as long as there is no detrimental 
effect observed for OS. It is yet unknown whether there is a positive correlation between RFS and OS 
and if higher rates of RFS will lead to an increase in OS in patients that have recurrent disease in the 
long term. There is some data that appears to suggest that a delay in recurrent disease may prolong 
OS, however, further long term data is needed to make any firm conclusion. 
In accordance with the guideline for the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man the trial is 
set up to include patients representative of those likely to be treated with the experimental compound 
in clinical practice. Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered to be appropriate.  
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was 55 
years (range: 18-86), 58% were men, and 95% were white. Baseline ECOG performance status score 
was 0 (90%) or 1 (10%). The majority of patients had AJCC Stage III disease (81%), and 19% had 
Variation assessment report

Page 57/92 
 
  
  
Stage IV disease. Forty-eight percent of patients had macroscopic lymph nodes and 32% had tumour 
ulceration. Forty-two percent of patients were BRAF V600 mutation positive while 45% were BRAF wild 
type and; 13% BRAF were status was unknown. For tumour PD-L1 expression, 34% of patients had 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% and 62% had < 5% as determined by clinical trial assay. Among patients with 
quantifiable tumour PD-L1 expression, the distribution of patients was balanced across the treatment 
groups. Tumour PD-L1 expression was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay.  
The number of elderly patients was balanced between the treatment groups. Patients ≥65 years old 
comprised 26.5% of the nivolumab group and 25.5% of the ipilimumab group. The number of patients 
≥75 years low with 17 (3.8%) and 13 (2.9%) patients in the nivolumab and ipilimumab arms, 
respectively. It is of note that the trial inclusion criteria also included adolescents 15 year an above but 
no patient within this age demographic was enrolled.  
Via protocol amendment 18, an interim analysis for RFS was added during the study, only 4 months in 
advance. In general, interim analyses for PFS-like endpoints are not recommended 
(EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1) however, this was taken into account in the calculation of the alpha 
spending and is not considered to have an impact on the validity or interpretability of the results. It is 
possible that there might have been some informative censoring when subjects withdrew consent or 
lost to follow-up or had the category other. As there were 154 RFS events in the nivolumab arm and 
206 in the ipilimumab arm, it is considered unlikely that this will affect the final conclusion on RFS.  
In general, the conduct of the study did not raise any serious concerns and there were no imbalances 
during randomization and in the different stratification groups which could have introduced any 
important biases in the analyses of the primary efficacy parameters. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary Endpoint – Recurrence-Free Survival 
The study met its primary endpoint in all randomized subjects. The trial demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in RFS for patients randomised to the nivolumab arm compared with the 
ipilimumab 10 mg/kg arm with HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54,0.81; stratified log-rank p < 0.0001).  
RFS rates were higher in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group at 6 months (79.6% vs 
72.4%), at 12 months (70.4% vs 60.0%), at 18 months (65.8% vs 53.0%), at 24 month (62.6% vs 
50.2%) and at 30 months (60.4% vs 44.4%). Minimum follow-up was approximately 24 months. OS 
was not mature at the time of this analysis. A separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves is shown. The 
difference in RFS rate between the nivolumab group and ipilimumab group is increasing over time 
7.2%, 10.4%, 12.8%, 12.5% and 16.0% at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months, respectively. Although the 
treatment was stopped at 12 months, the separation of the curves seems to continue over time and 
appears to stabilise. It is unlikely that the trend will change after further follow up as most patients in 
stage IIB/C and IV at high risk of recurrence will have relapsed within 3 years. 
There is some evidence from the literature that RFS may be a surrogate for OS16. The studies used in 
this modelling approach  were performed at the time that the treatment landscape in the advanced 
melanoma setting did not include immunotherapies.. However, no long-term efficacy data were 
presented for the trial CA209238. A descriptive analysis of the immature OS was presented showing no 
detriment. As the efficacy assessment in terms of OS is based partially on the assumption that the 
surrogate endpoints (RFS and DMFS) may lead to an improvement on OS in the long term, it would be 
important to confirm the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression. 
Therefore, the final RFS/DMFS analysis is expected to be performed in 2019 and the final OS analysis

is expected to be performed in 2020. The final study report of the RFS, DMFS and OS should be 
submitted for assessment.   
Secondary efficacy endpoint – Correlation between RFS and Baseline PD-L1 Expression, 
BRAF mutation status 
RFS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups, including tumour PD-L1 expression, 
BRAF status, and stage of disease. The results (with a minimal of 24 months follow-up) of the analysis 
of RFS by PD-L1 tumour expression showed that in patients with tumour expression ≥1%, ≥5%, 
≥10%  the HR was 0.61 (95%CI 0.47, 0.79), 0.54 (95%CI 0.36, 0.81) and 0.54 (95%CI 0.33, 0.87) 
suggesting that PD-L1 expression results in lower risk of recurrence in nivolumab treated group 
compared to ipilimumab treated group. However, in patients with tumours <1%, the HR was 0.78 
(95%CI 0.57, 1.08) with KM curves almost overlapping suggesting that patients treated with 
nivolumab may not have an advantage in terms of benefit over ipilimumab treatment and that 
nivolumab is at least as effective as ipilimumab in patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.  
Furthermore, in the analyses provided by the applicant, PD-L1 expression is defined using the 
percentage of tumour cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of any intensity. Efficacy 
in melanoma patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors might also be related to PD-L1 expression on 
tumour-associated inflammatory cells17 . To understand the value of PD-L1 expression in the tumour 
and on the infiltrating immune cells it is essential to analyse PD-L1 expression on the infiltrating 
immune cells as well to correlate the expression of PD-L1 on the infiltrating inflammatory cells (and the 
PD-L1 expression on both tumour cells and inflammatory cells) with efficacy. There is uncertainties 
with respect to the efficacy of a nivolumab  in certain sub-populations that could not be resolved prior 
to marketing authorisation and require further clinical evidence. Therefore, the MAH has committed to 
investigate the predictive value of biomarkers for the efficacy of nivolumab, which has been included 
as condition to the MA in Annex IID.  
Subgroup analyse for BRAF WT vs V600 mutation showed that there was no effect of BRAF mutation 
on the RFS or DMFS in patients treated with either nivolumab or ipilimumab.  
Exploratory Endpoint – Distant Metastasis-free Survival 
There was a favourable DMFS shown for nivolumab compared to ipilimumab with HR = 0.76 (95% CI: 
0.59, 0.98; stratified log-rank p = 0.0340). The DMFS rate at 24 months was also favourable in the 
nivolumab group 70.5% compared to 63.7% for ipilumumab group. DMFS is an exploratory endpoint, 
however it is supportive of the overall effect on RFS and the clinical benefit of nivolumab as adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma. From a clinical perspective, as melanoma is generally considered to be 
incurable when distant metastasis are present, a prolonged period free of distant metastasis, could be 
considered as a more clinically relevant representative for long-term clinical benefit, rather than RFS. 
Subgroup analyses 
In general, the subgroup analyses for both RFS and DFMS were consistent with the overall population. 
For some subgroups, the unstratified HR for RFS did not favour nivolumab over ipilimumab, but this 
was mainly due to small sample size with large variations and therefore, not clinically meaningful.  
In addition, LDH expression is a strong prognostic factor in (metastatic) melanoma. No subgroup 
analysis was performed on LDH expression. Over 90% of the subject had normal LDH expression. 
Therefore, the subgroup of patients with high LDH is very small and no conclusions can be made.   
Multivariate analysis of RFS  
In a multivariate analysis of RFS, the treatment effect when adjusted for age (≥ 65 years vs < 65 
years), gender (male vs female), baseline ECOG performance status (PS) (1 vs 0), disease stage

5%; indeterminate vs < 5%), and time from surgical resection to randomization (≥ 6 weeks vs < 6 
weeks) was consistent with the primary RFS analysis (data not shown).

Progression-free survival on next line systemic therapy  
A post-hoc analysis of PFS2 showed an improvement on next line systemic therapy with nivolumab 3 
mg/kg as adjuvant therapy compared with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (HR = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.97]; 
stratified log-rank p =0.0302). Assuming that next-line therapy is mainly given when recurrence 
occurs, it is likely that the time to next-line therapy is in favour of nivolumab compared to ipilimumab, 
as the nivolumab patients have a longer time until recurrence (HR=0.60 [95% CI: 0.46,0.77). No 
difference is seen in time to second next-line systemic therapy between the two treatment groups, 
although no firm conclusions can be drawn due to a low number of events and extensive censoring. 
Extrapolation to patients stage IIIA 
The trial included only adult patients with Stage IIIB, IIIC and IV (as per the AJCC 7th edition), but the 
initially requested indication also included patients with Stage IIIA and adolescents. Keeping the new 
AJCC 8th edition in mind, the current trial included patients with a wide range of prognostic estimates 
(including patients in the “new” category IIIA) Therefore, the wording of the indication  became a more 
general wording without the mentioning of specific disease stages. 
Extrapolation to adolescents 
The MAH initially requested an indication that included adolescent from 12 years and older, in line with 
the inclusion criteria of the protocol . However, only adult patients of 18 years and older were enrolled 
in the trial. As no data has been generated in this patient population with early signs of disease, a 
similar PK and safety profile cannot be assumed in adjuvant melanoma for this patient population 
event taking account the argument that disease characteristics for stage III-IV melanoma between 
adolescents and adults might be comparable. Therefore, the indication was restricted to adult patients 
only. 
Quality of Life 
With regard to all 3 questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, EQ-5D and WPAI:GH) at baseline, the scores 
were comparable between treatment groups (not statistically tested). Although reduction in the mean 
change score from baseline as seen, none were reaching the MID for the patient at any time point for 
either treatment group. For the QLQ-C30 also no clinically meaningful difference in score were 
detected for the individual functioning or symptom scales in both treatment groups (SmPC section 
5.1). 
Additional expert consultation 
Upon request from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), this SAG meeting was 
convened on 18 June 2018 in the context of an extension of indication procedure. The following 
questions were addressed by the experts: 
1. What is the clinical relevance of the improvement in RFS when seen in light of the results 
of the analyses of the secondary endpoints, eg dMFS, having in mind: 
• 
• 
• 
that available OS data are descriptive and limited; 
the standard of care in the EU is observation; 
ipilimumab has shown an OS benefit as adjuvant treatment for melanoma at a time 
that checkpoint inhibitors were not available. 
The SAG agreed that RFS is considered a reliable and clinically relevant endpoint in this setting of 
adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma. This is in concordance with the EMA anticancer guidelines. 
The relevance also in the melanoma setting is justified on the basis of delaying distant metatstases, 
which is associated with very poor prognosis. It is acknowledged that a fraction of distant metastases 
are still amenable to surgery (e.g., small cutaneous or lymph-node recurrence) but the majority carry 
a very poor prognosis (e.g., CNS metastasis). 
The effect on RFS was, in addition, supported by an effect on DMFS. The effect in terms of RFS was 
larger compared to interferon or iplilimumab (both of which are sometimes used as adjuvant 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 61/92 
 
  
  
 
treatments). PFS2 data are also supportive showing that an important detriment in subsequent 
treatments and OS is unlikely.  
Nivolumab increases the efficacy compared to ipilimumab (already an improvement compared to no 
adjuvant treatment) and the former is associated with a better toxicity profile.  
From a biological point of view, it is likely that a better effect can be achieved when the tumor load is 
smaller as in the adjuvant setting compared to the metastatic setting (this paradigm has been verified 
in a number of solid tumors for chemotherapy) and data from another PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab 
showed a consistent (and somewhat larger) effect in stage IIIA patients. From a mechanism of action 
point of view, immunotherapy may also be more active early on in the disease before the development 
of subclones that may escape immunological surveillance, potentially also associated with higher 
degree of tumour heterogeneity in the macrometastatic setting. 
The question of whether treating earlier in the adjuvant setting is better than treating later in the 
metastatic setting is often raised when introducing treatments at earlier stages of disease. Although 
there are no data to compare the two strategies, from a patient preference point of view, spending 
longer time recurrence and distance metastasis-free is very likely to be more valuable than spending 
longer time in the metastatic setting. Also, given the pace of discovery, this may also increase the 
chances of more effective treatments becoming available before reaching the metastatic setting.  
There was some discussion about whether the effect observed could be extrapolated to the current 
stage IIIA classification (TNM classification version 8) that includes better prognosis patients than 
those treated in the study (version 7). Although there were diverging views, the prevalent view was 
that the effects observed could be extrapolated to the new staging system. Any uncertainty about 
treating lower-risk patients should be part of the patient-physician discussion, including other risk 
factors and co-morbidities.  
2. Please discuss the possible impact of adjuvant treatment with nivolumab on the efficacy 
of subsequent post-progression therapy. 
The SAG agreed unanimously that based on the results of PFS2, it is unlikely that treatment with 
nivolumab in the adjuvant setting hampers the efficacy of subsequent treatments.  
3. Is the safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen acceptable for the intended 
patient population? 
Yes, the safety profile is acceptable in compared to other adjuvant treatments in other solid tumours 
(e.g., breast cancer; colorectal cancer) and compared to treatments in melanoma that have been 
studied and are sometimes used, like interferon and ipilimumab.  Although rare severe toxicity is 
possible, including endocrine, CNS and lung toxicity, no fatalities were reported for nivolumab in the 
present study. The toxicity is also acceptable in relative terms given the effect on RFS observed, and 
overall the benefit-risk balance is therefore judged to be positive.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data based on statistically significant RFS suggests a clinically meaningful benefit 
of nivolumab on adjuvant treatment compared to ipilimumab in high risk, completely resectable Stage 
IIIb/c and IV melanoma subjects of 18 years of age and older. RFS benefit was consistently 
demonstrated across subgroups, including tumour PD-L1 expression, BRAF status, and stage of 
disease. These data are supported by the subgroup analyses as well as DMFS and PFS2. As OS is still 
immature, it is not clear whether this prolongation in RFS and DMFS will translate into a long-term 
survival benefit but the evidence so far accumulated, though immature, suggests no detrimental effect 
on OS. As the staging of the disease has changed and the studied population is different than the 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 62/92 
 
  
  
patient population described in the updated strata for stage IIIB/C and IV, the proposed indication has 
been amended to reflect the intended population at high risk of recurrence i.e. in patients with 
involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab and/or nivolumab + ipilimumab 
combination therapy should be further explored, specifically: 
• 
To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour 
cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut offs, that might 
prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1 (on 
tumour- and tumour associated immune cells), PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with 
measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, Tumour mutational burden) as predictive of 
nivolumab adjuvant therapy efficacy. This will be provided for the approved indications: 
-  Adjuvant treatment of melanoma (monotherapy): study CA209238 
• 
The MAH should submit the final OS data for study CA209238: A Phase 3, randomised double-
blind study of OPDIVO versus Yervoy in patients who have undergone complete resection of 
Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV melanoma.  Due 4Q2020. 
The CHMP considers the following measure is required as a post-authorisation measure to address 
issues related to efficacy: 
•  RFS/DMFS PAM: The MAH committed to provide the updated RFS/DMFS data with a minimal 
follow-up of 36 months as soon as it is available. Due 4Q2019. This should be reflected in a 
PAM. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current safety data have been provided from the individual phase II and III studies across the 
various indications, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), head and neck cancer (SCCHN) and urothelial carcinoma (UC). 
The known safety profile of nivolumab includes fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints (including diarrhoea 
and nausea), and multiple immune-related AEs, including immune-related pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, nephritis, rash, and endocrinopathies (including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal 
insufficiency, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, and diabetic ketoacidosis).  
New safety data presented in this application come from the pivotal Study CA209238. The all-treated 
population in the pivotal study, which are all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose 
of study drug, was the primary population for safety analyses. This population included 452 patients in 
the nivolumab group and 453 patients in the ipilimumab group. At the time of the Interim analysis (12 
June 2017), the minimum follow-up period was approximately 18 months. Safety and tolerability were 
measured by the incidence of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and laboratory 
abnormalities. Analyses were conducted using the 30-day and 100-day safety window from day of last 
dose received. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 
20.0. AEs and laboratory values were graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 63/92 
 
  
  
 
 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Also safety and 
tolerability were further quantified by the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs leading to 
dose modification, select AEs, immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs), and other events of special interest. 
Patient exposure 
The proportion of treated subjects who received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity was 86.3% in 
the nivolumab group and 80.1% in the ipilimumab group. 94.9% of treated subjects in both groups 
received first dose of treatment within 3 days of randomization. The median number of doses received 
was 24.0 (range: 1 - 26) in the nivolumab group and 4.0 (range: 1 - 7) in the ipilimumab group. The 
median duration of therapy was 11.50 months in the nivolumab group and 2.73 months in the 
ipilimumab group. After approximately 3 weeks, the proportion of subjects still on therapy was higher 
at every time point in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group. 
For dose omissions, 35.4% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 19.6 % in the ipilimumab group 
had a dose omission (Table 15). Primary reason for dose omission was AEs in both groups. Relatively 
more subjects in the nivolumab arm compared to the ipilimumab arm had dose omissions; however, 
relatively more subjects in the ipilimumab arm had dose omissions due to AEs. More subjects in the 
nivolumab arm had dose omission due to other reasons. 
Table 15:  
Dose omission of Study Therapy - All Treated Subjects 
For infusion interruptions, 2.4% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 4.0% in the ipilimumab group 
had an infusion interruption. Of the subjects who required an infusion interruption, most had 1 infusion 
interrupted in both groups. 
For infusion rate reductions, 3.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 3.1% in the ipilimumab 
group had an infusion rate reduction. Of the subjects who required an infusion interruption, most had 
only 1 infusion rate reduction in both groups. 
Concomitant Therapy 
Most subjects (91.8% nivolumab and 95.6% ipilimumab) received concomitant non-study medications. 
Immune-modulating concomitant medications were administered for management of AEs in 45.1% and 
79.2% of subjects in the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, respectively. Systemic corticosteroids 
were the most common type of immune-modulating medication administered (31.6% of nivolumab 
subjects and 70.2% of ipilimumab subjects). Immunosuppressive agents such as infliximab were 
administered to fewer subjects in the nivolumab arm (1.8%) than in the ipilimumab arm (10.2%). Pre-
medication with systemic corticosteroids was administered to 1.3% of treated subjects in both groups. 
Dermatological preparation of corticosteroids were administered equally in nivolumab and ipilimumab 
subjects (23.9% vs 29.6% respectively).

Adverse events 
Any grade adverse events were reported in 96.9% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 98.5% of 
subjects in the ipilimumab group (Table 16). In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported AEs 
were fatigue (42.7%), diarrhoea (36.9%), pruritus (28.1%), rash (25.4%), headache (23.5%), and 
nausea (23.0%). In the ipilimumab group, the most frequently reported AEs were diarrhoea (54.5%), 
fatigue (40.8%), pruritus (36.9%), rash (33.1%), headache (31.3%), nausea (28.0%), and pyrexia 
(21.2%). 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 25.4% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 55.2% of subjects in 
the ipilimumab group (Table 16). In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs 
were lipase increased (4.9%), diarrhoea (2.4%), and amylase increased (2.4%). In the ipilimumab 
group, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs were diarrhoea (10.6%), colitis (7.7%), and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (6.2%). A similar AE pattern was seen in subjects with 
extended follow-up (100 days after last dose). 
Table 16: Adverse Events by Worst CTC Grade Reported in ≥ 10% of Subjects - All Treated 
Subjects 
Late-Emergent Adverse Events 
Late-emergent drug-related AEs were defined as drug-related AEs with an onset date > 100 days after 
the last dose of study therapy. Late emergent drug-related AEs were reported in 16 (3.5%) subjects in 
the nivolumab group, including 3 (0.7%, diarrhea, pneumonitis, diabetic ketoacidosis) with Grade 3-4 
events, and 22 (4.9%) subjects in the ipilimumab group, including 6 (1.3%; diarrhoea, colitis, rash, 
adrenocortical insufficiency, increased lipase, bone marrow failure, immune thrombocytopenic purpura) 
with Grade 3-4 events. No events were reported in >1% of subjects in either treatment group.

Drug-Related Adverse Events 
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported in 85.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 95.8% of 
subjects in the ipilimumab group, and the pattern is similar to the all causality AEs. In the nivolumab 
group, the most frequently reported drug-related AEs were fatigue (34.5%), diarrhoea (24.3%), and 
pruritus (23.2%). In the ipilimumab group, the most frequently reported drug-related AEs were 
diarrhoea (45.9%), pruritus (33.6%), fatigue (32.9%), rash (29.4%), and nausea (20.1%). 
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 14.4% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 45.9% of 
subjects in the ipilimumab group. In the nivolumab group, Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported in ≥ 
1% of subjects were lipase increased (4.2%), amylase increased (2.0%), diarrhoea (1.5%), ALT 
increased (1.1%), and rash (1.1%). 
In the ipilimumab group, Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported in ≥ 1% of subjects were diarrhoea 
(9.5%), colitis (7.5%), ALT increased (5.7%), AST increased (4.2%), lipase increased (3.5%), rash 
(3.1%), hypophysitis (2.4%), rash maculo-papular (2.0%), headache (1.5%), GGT increased (1.3%), 
transaminases increased (1.3%), hepatitis (1.3%), and pruritus, amylase increased, and autoimmune 
colitis (all 1.1%). 
A similar drug-related AE pattern was seen in subjects with extended follow-up (100 days after last 
dose). 
When incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, the AE rate was lower in the nivolumab group than in 
the ipilimumab group (1264.7 vs 2267.7 incidence rate per 100 person years).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The overall frequencies of SAEs and drug-related SAEs were lower in the nivolumab group than in the 
ipilimumab group. Drug-related SAEs consisted mainly of events in the System Organ Class (SOCs) of 
Gastrointestinal and Endocrine Disorders in both treatment groups. 
SAEs were reported in 17.5% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 40.4% of subjects in the 
ipilimumab group (Table 17). Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 10.6% and 31.8% of subjects in the 
nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, respectively. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported 
SAEs were melanoma recurrent (1.8%) and cellulitis (1.5%). In the ipilimumab group, the most 
frequently reported SAEs were diarrhoea (7.7%) and colitis (7.1%). 
Drug-related SAEs were reported in 5.3% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 31.1% of subjects 
in the ipilimumab group. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were reported in 3.3% and 24.5% of subjects in 
the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, respectively. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently 
reported drug-related SAEs were diarrhoea and pneumonitis (0.7% each). In the ipilimumab group, 
the most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were diarrhea and colitis (7.1% each).  
The frequency of serious adverse events (all causality and drug-related) in subject with Extended 
follow-up (100 days after last dose) is somewhat higher. In general, more events were seen occurring 
in the ipilimumab group than in the nivolumab group.

SAEs by Worst CTC Grade Reported in ≥ 1% of Subject - All Treated Subjects 
Deaths 
As of the 12-Jun-2017 database lock, the immature data show no detriment between the arms. 
Disease progression was the most common cause of death for both groups (both arms 9.1%). There 
were no deaths occurring within 30 days of last dose for either group and the proportion of deaths 
occurring within 100 days of last dose was low for both groups. 
No deaths in the nivolumab group and 2 (0.4%) deaths in the ipilimumab group were attributed to 
study drug toxicity by the investigator. One patient died due to colitis 127 day after last dose of 
ipilimumab and one patient died due to medullary aplasia 203 days after last dose of ipilimumab.  
Three patients treated with nivolumab died due to other reasons; cerebral haemorrhage, sepsis, and 
septic shock. In the ipilimumab group 2 patients died due to other reasons; general conditions 
worsening– and septic shock with multi-organ failure and pneumococcal pneumonia. 
Select adverse events 
Endocrine events 
The endocrine select AE category included the following subcategories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, 
pituitary disorders, and thyroid disorders. Endocrine select AEs (all-causality, by worst CTC grade) 
were reported in 106 (23.5%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 106 (23.4%) subjects in the 
ipilimumab group.  
In the nivolumab group, 102 (22.6%) subjects had endocrine select AEs that were considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator. In the ipilimumab group, 96 (21.2%) subjects had endocrine select 
AEs that were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. The most commonly reported drug-
related event in the nivolumab group was hypothyroidism (10.8%) and in the ipilimumab group was 
hypophysitis (12.4%). The majority of the drug-related endocrine events were Grade 1-2 (93.6% and 
83.5% for nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively); 7 (1.5%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 19 
(4.2%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had Grade 3-4 events. Endocrine drug-related select AEs (any 
grade) led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab in 3 subjects (0.7%; 2 had Grade 3-4 events) 
and of ipilimumab in 27 subjects (6.0%; 12 subjects had Grade 3-4 events). 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018

The median time to onset of all grade drug-related endocrine AEs was 8.21 weeks in the nivolumab 
group, and 8.93 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 17 subjects (16.7%) and 65 subjects (67.7%) 
received immune modulating medication for any grade drug-related endocrine select AEs in the 
nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, respectively. 8 (7.8%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 35 
(36.5%) subjects in the ipilimumab group were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median 
duration of 3.14 and 2.57 weeks, respectively. 
Overall, 52.9% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 42.7% of subjects in the ipilimumab group with 
drug-related endocrine select AEs resolved; median time to resolution was approximately 48 weeks in 
the nivolumab group and was not available in the ipilimumab group. 
Gastrointestinal Events 
Gastrointestinal select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 172 (38.1%) subjects in the 
nivolumab group and 256 (56.5%) subjects in the ipilimumab. 
114 (25.2%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 219 (48.3%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had 
GI select AEs that were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. Most drug-related events 
were Grade 1-2 (92.7% and 74.2% for nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively); 9 (2.0%) subjects in 
the nivolumab group and 76 (16.8%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had Grade 3-4 events. GI drug-
related select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab in 12 subjects (2.7%; 8 
had Grade 3-4 events) and of ipilimumab in 84 subjects (18.5%; 66 subjects had Grade 3-4 events). 
The median time to onset of drug-related GI select AEs was 7.71 weeks in the nivolumab group and 
4.43 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 24 subjects (21.1%) and 137 subjects (62.6%) received immune 
modulating medication for any grade drug-related GI select AEs in the nivolumab and ipilimumab 
groups, respectively. 17 subjects (14.9%) in the nivolumab group and 113 subjects (51.6%) in the 
ipilimumab group were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 2.86 and 4.0 
weeks, respectively. 
Overall, 95.6% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 97.3% of subjects in the ipilimumab group with 
drug-related GI select AEs resolved; median time to resolution was 2.43 weeks in the nivolumab group 
and 3.14 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 
Hepatic Events 
Hepatic select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 50 subjects (11.1%) in the nivolumab 
group and 116 subjects (25.6%) in the ipilimumab group. 
41 (9.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 96 (21.2%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had 
hepatic select AEs considered to be drug-related by the investigator. Most drug-related events were 
Grade 1-2 (83.7 % and 66.2% for nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively); 8 (1.8%) subjects in the 
nivolumab group and 49 (10.8%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had Grade 3-4 events. Hepatic 
drug-related select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab in 3 subjects 
(0.7%; 2 had Grade 3-4 events) and of ipilimumab in 34 subjects (7.5%; 31 subjects had Grade 3-4 
events). 
The median time to onset of drug-related hepatic select AEs was 12.29 weeks in the nivolumab group 
and 8.14 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 12 subjects (29.3%) and 40 subjects (41.7%) received 
immune modulating medication for any grade drug-related hepatic select AEs in the nivolumab and 
ipilimumab groups, respectively. 12 subjects (29.3%) in the nivolumab group and 33 subjects (34.4%) 
in the ipilimumab group were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 2.64 and 
4.29 weeks, respectively.

nivolumab group and 4 (0.9%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had Grade 3-4 events. Pulmonary 
drug-related select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab in 2 subjects 
(0.4%; none had Grade 3-4 events) and of ipilimumab in 7 subjects (1.5%; 4 subjects had Grade 3-4 
events) 
The median time to onset of drug-related pulmonary select AEs was 7.79 weeks in the nivolumab 
group and 10.0 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 6 subjects (100%) and 10 subjects (90.9%) received

and 17 (3.8%) subjects in the ipilimumab group. 
6 subjects (1.3%) in the nivolumab group and 7 subjects (1.5%) in the ipilimumab group had renal 
select AEs that were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. All events were Grade 1-2. It 
should be noted that 3/6 subject in the nivolumab group had acute kidney injury as an adverse event.  
Drug-related renal select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab in 1 subject 
(0.2%) and of ipilimumab in 1 subject (0.2%) 
The median time to onset of drug-related renal select AEs was 14.21 weeks in the nivolumab group 
and 9.71 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 1 subject (16.7%) in the nivolumab group and no subjects in 
the ipilimumab group received immune modulating medication for any grade drug-related renal select 
AEs. No subjects were treated with high-dose corticosteroids. Overall, 66.7% of subjects in the 
nivolumab group and 57.1% of subjects in the ipilimumab group with drug-related renal select AEs 
resolved; median time to resolution was 10.5 weeks in the nivolumab group and 52.71 weeks in the 
ipilimumab group. 
Skin Events 
Skin select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 243 subjects (53.8%) in the nivolumab 
group and 294 subjects (64.9%) in the ipilimumab group. 201 subjects (44.5%) in the nivolumab 
group and 271 subjects (59.8%) in the ipilimumab group had skin select AEs considered to be drug-
related by the investigator. The most frequently reported drug-related events in both groups were 
pruritus, rash, and rash maculo-papular. Most of the drug-related events were Grade 1-2 (97.6% and 
90.9% for nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively); 5 (1.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 27 
(6.0%) subjects in the ipilimumab group had Grade 3-4 events. Drug-related skin select AEs (any

grade) led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab in 2 subjects (0.4%; 1 subject had a Grade 3-4 
event) and of ipilimumab in 8 subjects (1.8%; 7 subjects had Grade 3-4 events). 
The median time to onset of drug-related skin select AEs was 8.43 weeks in the nivolumab group and 
2.57 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 73 subjects (36.3%) and 128 subjects (47.2%) received immune 
modulating medication for any grade drug-related skin select AEs in the nivolumab and ipilimumab 
groups, respectively. 2 subjects (1.0%) in the nivolumab group and 24 subjects (8.9%) in the 
ipilimumab group were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 7.86 and 2.07 
weeks, respectively. 
Overall, 66.7% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 73.8% of subjects in the ipilimumab group with 
drug-related skin select AEs resolved; median time to resolution was 22.14 weeks in the nivolumab 
group and 9.29 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 
Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions 
Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 14 subjects (3.1%) in 
the nivolumab group and 10 subjects (2.2%) in the ipilimumab group. 11 subjects (2.4%) in the 
nivolumab group and 9 subjects (2.0%) in the ipilimumab group had infusion reaction events that were 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator. All of the drug-related events were Grade 1-2 except 
1 (0.2%) Grade 3-4 event of bronchospasm in the nivolumab group; none led to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug. 
The median time to onset of drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs was 3.29 weeks 
in the nivolumab group and 6.14 weeks in the ipilimumab group. 2 subjects (18.2%) in the nivolumab 
group and 2 subjects (22.2%) in the ipilimumab group received immune modulating medication for 
any grade drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs. 1 subject (9.1%) in the 
nivolumab group and 1 subject (11.1%) in the ipilimumab group were treated with high-dose 
corticosteroids for a median duration of 2.29 and 0.29 weeks, respectively. Overall, 90.9% of subjects 
in the nivolumab group and 100% of subjects in the ipilimumab group with drug-related 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs resolved; median time to resolution was 0.14 weeks in 
both groups. 
Immune mediated adverse events (IMAE) 
IMAE analyses included events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 days of the last dose (ie, 
with extended follow up). These analyses were limited to subjects who received immune-modulating 
medication for treatment of the event, with the exception of endocrine events, which were included in 
the analysis regardless of treatment since these events are often managed without 
immunosuppression. Endocrine IMAEs included the among others the categories of adrenal 
insufficiency, hypophysitis, hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus.  
Overall, the majority of IMAEs in the nivolumab group were Grade 1-2. In the Ipilimumab group the 
majority of patient with IMAEs in the Diarrhea/Colitis and Hepatitis were Grade 3-4. Grade 3-4 IMAEs 
in the rash, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, and hypophysitis categories were less frequently reported (at 
least 2% difference between treatment groups) in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group; 
other categories (grade 3-4) were reported at similar frequencies. The most frequently reported IMAE 
categories (any grade events) were rash (16.2%) and hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (13.9%) in the 
nivolumab group and diarrhea/colitis (31.8%) and rash (23.2%) in the ipilimumab group. The most 
frequently reported IMAE categories (Grade 3-4 events) were diarrhea/colitis (2.0%) and hepatitis 
(2.0%) in the nivolumab group and diarrhoea/colitis (17.2%) and hepatitis (7.5%) in the ipilimumab 
group. 
Variation assessment report

Across IMAE categories, the majority of events were manageable, with resolution occurring when 
immune-modulating medications (mostly systemic corticosteroids) were administered. Some endocrine 
IMAEs, were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.

Other events of special interest (OESIs) 
OESI included the following categories: demyelination, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, 
myasthenic syndrome, myocarditis, myositis, pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, and uveitis.  
In the nivolumab group, OESIs within 100 days of last dose of nivolumab were reported as follows: 
•  4 subjects with pancreatitis 
•  3 subjects with uveitis 
In the ipilimumab group, OESIs within 100 days of last dose of ipilimumab were reported as follows: 
•  1 subject with a Guillain-Barré Syndrome event (Miller Fisher Syndrome) 
•  3 subjects with pancreatitis 
•  4 subjects with uveitis 
•  1 subject with encephalitis 
•  3 subjects with a myositis event (1 with dermatomyositis, 1 with myositis, 1 with polymyositis) 
In the nivolumab group, all EOSIs resolved as of data base lock (DBL). In the ipilimumab group, all 
OESIs resolved, with the exception of an event of Grade 4 drug-related Miller Fisher Syndrome and 
Grade 2 drug-related dermatomyositis. Among both treatment groups, the following OESI categories 
had no reported events: myasthenic syndrome, demyelination, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolisis. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Abnormalities in haematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1-2 in the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups. No Grade 3-4 hematologic 
abnormalities were reported in ≥1% of subjects in either treatment group.  
The most prominent shit from baseline was an increase in grade (from 0 to 1-2 or from 1 to 2) for 
leukocytes and lymphocytes after nivolumab treatment.

Serum Chemistry 
Liver function tests 
In the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were 
primarily Grade 1-2. 
• 
• 
In the nivolumab group, there were no Grade 3-4 hepatic abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of 
subjects. 73.6% and 69.1% ware grade 0 for AST and ALT, respectively. 
In the ipilimumab group, the only Grade 3-4 hepatic abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of 
subjects were increased ALT (8.6% Grade 3; 3.2% Grade 4) and increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (7.2% Grade 3; 1.4% Grade 4). 69.1% and 56.5% were grade 0 for 
AST and ALT, respectively. 
The overview of on-treatment laboratory abnormalities is provided in Table 19.

(SI Units) - All Treated Subjects 
Kidney function tests 
In the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, the majority of subjects with at least 1 on-treatment 
measurement had normal creatinine values during the treatment reporting period. 
In both groups, reported abnormalities in creatinine (increases) were all Grade 1 or 2 (15.4% and 
14.4% for nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively). No Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were reported. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
The majority of subjects in both groups had normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at 
baseline and throughout the treatment period. The proportion of subjects with TSH increases (> ULN) 
was higher in the nivolumab group than the ipilimumab group (28.0 vs 15.1%, respectively). 
Electrolytes 
In the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, most subjects had normal electrolyte levels during the 
treatment reporting period, and the frequency of these normal electrolyte levels are similar in the two

treatment groups. In both groups, abnormalities in electrolytes during treatment were primarily Grade 
1 to 2 in severity.  
• 
• 
In the nivolumab group, there were no Grade 3-4 abnormalities in electrolytes reported in ≥ 
2% of subjects. 
In the ipilimumab group, the only Grade 3-4 abnormalities in electrolytes reported in ≥ 2% of 
subjects were hyponatremia (2.5% Grade 3, 0.7% Grade 4) and hypokalemia (1.6% Grade 3; 
0.5% Grade 4). 
Pancreas Function Tests 
In the nivolumab and ipilimumab groups, the majority of subjects had normal amylase and lipase 
values during the treatment reporting period, and the frequency of subjects with normal levels were 
similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, abnormalities in amylase and lipase 
(increases) during treatment were primarily Grade 1-2. 
• 
• 
In the nivolumab group, the only Grade 3-4 abnormality reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was 
increased lipase (4.7% Grade 3; 2.7% Grade 4). 
In the ipilimumab group, the only Grade 3-4 abnormality reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was 
increased lipase (7.1% Grade 3; 1.4% Grade 4). 
Immunogenicity Results - Exploratory Endpoint 
There was low incidence of immunogenicity when nivolumab and ipilimumab were administered as 
monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. The incidence of subjects being ADA positive was 2.3% (10/426 
subjects) and 0.7% (3/405 subjects) following nivolumab and ipilimumab monotherapy. Three subjects 
(0.7%) were persistent positive in the nivolumab group. No subjects were neutralizing ADA (NAb) 
positive following either nivolumab or ipilimumab administration. As of the time of the interim analysis, 
28 samples from subjects that were positive for ADA in the nivolumab arm were not included in the 
NAb analyses as they were shipped to the analyzing lab following the database lock. However, these 
samples have since been analyzed, and all were NAb negative. ADA titers were low ranging from 1 to 8 
following nivolumab and 1 to 64 following ipilimumab.

Safety in special populations 
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab group for subgroups of gender, 
race, age, and region were similar to the AE frequencies in the overall treated population. Small 
numerical differences in frequencies of AEs were observed in nivolumab-treated subjects in the 
following subgroups: 
•  A greater frequency of drug-related any-grade AEs was reported in the ≥75 age group 
(94.1%) vs the <65 age group (85.8%) and also vs the ≥65 and < 75 age group (81.6%); 
however, a lower frequency of drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in the ≥75 age group 
(5.9% vs 12.7% and 21.4%). 
•  A greater frequency of all-causality and drug-related AEs was reported in White subjects 
(97.4% and 86.4%) vs Asian subjects (87.5% and 66.7%). 
•  A greater frequency of drug-related AEs was reported in US and Canada (93.6%) vs Western 
Europe (82.8%), Eastern Europe (77.5%), or Asia (66.7%). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of study therapy 
As of the 12-Jun-2017 database lock, all subjects in both treatment groups had discontinued study 
treatment. Primary reason for treatment discontinuation was treatment completion (ie, completed 
protocol-specified maximum treatment duration of 1 year) in the nivolumab group (60.8% vs 26.9% in 
the ipilimumab group) and study drug toxicity in the ipilimumab group (45.9% vs 9.1% in the 
nivolumab group). Discontinuation due to disease recurrence was 26.8% in the nivolumab group and 
22.3% in the ipilimumab group. 
Discontinuation due to Adverse Events 
The overall frequencies of all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation were lower in the nivolumab 
group than in the ipilimumab group. 
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 9.7% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 42.6% of 
subjects in the ipilimumab group (Table 21). Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 
4.6% and 30.9% of the subjects in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group, respectively. In the 
nivolumab group, the most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation were diarrhea (7 
subjects, 1.5%) and colitis (5 subjects, 1.1%). In the ipilimumab group, the most frequently reported 
AEs leading to discontinuation were also diarrhea (46 subjects, 10.2%) and colitis (37 subjects, 8.2%). 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.7% of subjects in the nivolumab group 
and 41.7% of subjects in the ipilimumab group. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation 
were reported in 3.5% and 30.0% of the subjects in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group, 
respectively. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation were diarrhea (7 subjects, 1.5%) and colitis (5 subjects, 1.1%). In the ipilimumab 
group, the most frequently reported drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were diarrhea (45 
subjects, 9.9%) and colitis (37 subjects, 8.2%).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data were presented for all subjects included in the pivotal study who received at least one dose 
of study drug (n=452 for nivolumab and n=453 for ipilimumab). The patient population in this trial has 
no or very low disease burden and is in general good health. Therefore, it should be expected that the 
toxicity observed in these subjects who do not have disease symptoms is most likely drug-related and 
not disease-related. 
The majority of subjects, 86.3% of the subjects in the nivolumab and 80.1% of the subjects in the 
ipilimumab group, received ≥90% of the planned dose intensity, and a medium duration of therapy of 
11.50 and 2.73 months respectively (intended treatment period of 12 months). The omission rate is 
higher in the nivolumab group compared to the ipilimumab group. This is likely caused by the fact that 
more doses of nivolumab are given. Total number of omitted doses divided by the total number of 
doses received indicates that 3.7% (325/8871) in the nivolumab group and 5.8% (108/1863) in the 
ipilimumab of the total amount of doses are omitted. In addition, the amount of administered immune-
modulating concomitant medication for the management of AEs is higher in subjects in the ipilimumab 
group. This suggests a more severe toxicity profile in the patients treated with ipilimumab. 
The currently described adverse events are known AEs with regard to nivolumab treatment. Any grade 
adverse events occurred at the same frequency as with ipilimumab (96.9% vs 98.5%, respectively). In 
the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported AEs were fatigue (42.7%), diarrhoea (36.9%), 
pruritus (28.1%), rash (25.4%), headache (23.5%), and nausea (23.0%). In the ipilimumab group, 
the most frequently reported AEs were diarrhoea (54.5%), fatigue (40.8%), pruritus (36.9%), rash 
(33.1%), headache (31.3%), nausea (28.0%), and pyrexia (21.2%). However, less grade 3-4 events 
occurred in the nivolumab group compared to the ipilimumab group (25.4% vs 55.2%, respectively). 
The toxicity in the adjuvant setting is similar to the toxicity reported in the advanced setting, but with 
slightly higher frequencies of AEs detected in the adjuvant setting. However, the incidence of grade 3-
Variation assessment report

4 AEs was not substantially different and certainly not consistently higher, for adjuvant melanoma than 
for other tumour types and treatment settings. 
Drug-related  AEs  were  reported  less  frequently  in  the  nivolumab  group  than  in  the  ipilimumab  group 
(85.2% vs 95.8%, respectively). Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported three times less frequent 
in  the  nivolumab  group  compared  to  the  ipilimumab  group  (14.4%%  and  45.9%).  In  the  dataset  of 
nivolumab  3  mg/kg  as  monotherapy  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  melanoma  (n  =  452),  the  most 
frequent  adverse  reactions  (≥  10%)  were  fatigue  (46%),  rash  (29%),  diarrhoea  (24%),  pruritus 
(23%), nausea (15%), arthralgia (13%), musculoskeletal pain (11%), and hypothyroidism (11%). The 
majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2).  
The number of patients with drug-related all grade select AEs is lower (gastrointestinal, 25.2% vs 
48.3%; hepatic, 9.1% vs 21.2% and skin, 44.5% vs 59.8%) or equal (endocrine, 22.6% vs 21.2%) in 
the nivolumab group compared to the ipilimumab groups. Fewer patients were treated with immune 
modulation medication in the nivolumab group compared to the ipilimumab group.  The specific 
endocrine disorders is differentially distributed between the nivolumab and the ipilimumab group. For 
nivolumab the most commonly reported drug-related events in the nivolumab group ware 
hypothyroidism (10.8%) and hyperthyroidism (8.0%) and in the ipilimumab group was hypophysitis 
(12.4%) and hypothyroidism (6.8%).  
The overall frequencies of SAEs (17.5% vs 40.4%) and drug-related SAEs (5.3% vs 31.1%) were 
lower in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were 
reported in approximately 3.3% in the nivolumab groups, while a 24.5% of the subjects in the 
ipilimumab group experienced Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs. Per category, the frequency is in general 
equal or lower in the nivolumab group. To be noted, SEAs in the category “neoplasm benign, malignant 
and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)” occur more often in the nivolumab group. However, these 
events are categorized as non-drug related. The incidence of grade 3-4 AEs and of SAEs was clearly 
lower in the nivolumab monotherapy arm than in the ipilimumab arm and a better safety profile for 
nivolumab compared to ipilimumab can be concluded.   
As of the 12-Jun-2017 database lock, a similar number of subjects died in both treatment groups, with 
disease progression as the most common cause of death.  
Immune mediated adverse events 
The majority of the IMAEs in the nivolumab group are grade 1-2, while in the ipilimumab group the 
majority are grade 3-4. Only the grade 1-2 IMAEs on hypothyroidism/thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism 
occur more often in the nivolumab group (13.9% and 8.6% vs 9.1% and 4.9% respectively),  while 
grade 3-4 IMAEs in the rash (Niv: 0.7%; Ipi: 4.8%), diarrhoea/colitis (Niv 2%: ; Ipi: 17.2%), hepatitis 
(Niv: 2%; Ipi: 7.5%), and hypophysitis (Niv: 0.4%; Ipi: 4.2%) categories occurred more often in the 
ipilimumab group. Therefore, the IMAE profile of nivolumab is less severe than that of ipilimumab. In 
both groups the majority of the events seems manageable by immune-modulation medication, with 
resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mostly systemic corticosteroids) were 
administered. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed for the majority of the laboratory parameters 
between the two treatment groups. Abnormalities in hepatic parameters occurred more often in the 
ipilimumab group, while the proportion of subjects with TSH increases (> ULN) was higher in the 
nivolumab group (Nivo: 28.0 vs Ipi: 15.1%). 
There was low incidence of immunogenicity when nivolumab and ipilimumab were administered as 
monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Overall, no association was observed between the presence of 
either nivolumab or ipilimumab antibodies and the occurrence of hypersensitivity and infusion-related 
reactions. 
No significant differences were detected in the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the 
nivolumab group for the subgroups of gender, race, age, and region.

As of the 12-Jun-2017 database lock, all subjects in both treatment groups had discontinued study 
treatment. For nivolumab, 60.8% of the subjects stopped due to treatment completion, 26.8% due to 
disease recurrence and 9.1% due to toxicity. For ipilimumab, 26.9% of the subjects stopped due to 
treatment completion, 22.3% due to disease recurrence and 45.9% due to toxicity. Drug-related AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.7% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 41.7% of 
subjects in the ipilimumab group. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There were no new safety signals reported during the treatment period and follow up period. The 
overall safety profile of nivolumab 3 mg/kg for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma (n = 452) was 
consistent with that established across tumour types for nivolumab monotherapy.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Annex II has been updated to reflect new conditions. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the 
changes made to the product information do not affect the readability of the package leaflet. 
In addition, the previously authorised indication for Opdivo in squamous cell cancer of the head and 
neck (SCCHN, procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0017) has been further clarified in order to better 
reflect the target population investigated in the pivotal trial supporting the application.  
Clinical oncologists expressed concerns that the previously authorised indication implied that patients 
in the (neo)adjuvant setting with a platinum-free-interval < 6 months who are still eligible for curative 
surgery and/or RT could also be treated with Opdivo, which does not have curative intent. 
The following wording has therefore been discussed and agreed with the MAH in section 4.1: 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell 
cancer of the head and neck in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy (see section 
5.1)” 
In addition, the following wording has been included in section 5.1: 
“The study included patients (18 years or older), with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic 
SCCHN (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx), stage III/IV and not amenable to local therapy with curative 
intent (surgery or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy) and who have experienced disease 
…” 
The query did not put into question the B/R of the approved indication. The new wording reflects the 
main inclusion criteria of the patients recruited into the pivotal study. The target population remains 
the same, and it is a clarification of indication to better describe the population intended to be treated. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Nivolumab is anti-PD1 antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells and thereby blocks the 
interaction between PD-1 with the ligands PDL-1 and PDL-2. By blocking binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2 to 
its PD-1 receptor, nivolumab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour response. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is applying for an indication in the treatment of adjuvant melanoma in adult patients with 
involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection. 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 83/92 
 
  
  
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to the staging based on the AJCC 7th edition, patients with stage III disease have metastatic 
nodes, but no distant metastasis. They are at a high risk of recurrence after locoregional resections. 
Stage IIIA patients have a primary tumour without ulceration and 1-3 micrometastasis in the nodes. 
While Stage IIIB and C have an ulcerate primary tumour and/or macrometastasis in the nodes. The 
risk of recurrence increases with increasing disease stage. The overall 5-year RFS for stage IIIA, IIIB, 
and IIIC patients has been shown to be approximately 63%, 32%, and 11% , and 5-year survival rates 
are 78%, 59% and 40%, respectively (American Cancer Society). The Stage IV 5-year survival rates 
are around 15-20%, though this percentage may in reality be higher due to the increase in the use of 
newly approved drugs for systemic treatment of patients with unresectable and stage IV disease. 
These new drugs include checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, including those that target PD-1 or 
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes antigen (CTLA-4), and drugs that target the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) pathway (BRAF and MEK inhibitors and the combination of these drugs). 
To reduce the risk of relapse, Stage III and IV patients are candidates for adjuvant treatment after 
complete surgical treatment.  
In the EU, adjuvant treatment with interferon is approved, but due to limited benefit and high toxicity 
this drug is rarely used in the setting of adjuvant treatment of melanoma. Ipilimumab is approved for 
the treatment of Stage III resected melanoma in the US but not in the EU. 
The standard of care after complete surgical resection differs per EU country. Observation of the 
lesions and low dose interferon are both used as standard of care in the EU 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
CA209238 is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study in subjects that had complete resection of 
stage IIIB/C or stage IV Melanoma and are at high risk of recurrence. Patients are treated with 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg (every 2 weeks, n=452) or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (every 3 weeks for 4 doses 
followed by every 12 weeks starting at week 24, n=453) with a maximum duration of treatment of 1 
year and a total follow-up of 5 years. The prognostic covariates, PDL-1 staging and disease staging, 
were used as stratification factors. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS), 
secondary endpoints were OS and RFS based on PD-L1 expression, and an exploratory endpoint was 
distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
With an initial minimal follow-up of 18 months, the primary endpoint RFS demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in RFS with nivolumab compared to ipilimumab (HR=0.65; 97.56% CI 0.51-
0.83; stratified log-rank p < 0.0001).  The updated analyses (with a minimal follow-up of 24 months) 
continued to show a benefit of nivolumab adjuvant therapy over ipilimumab adjuvant therapy with an 
HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.81).RFS rates were higher in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab 
group at 6 months (79.6% vs 72.4%, Δ7.2%), at 12 months (70.4% vs 60.0%, Δ10.4%), at 18 
months (65.8% vs 53.0%, Δ12.8%), at 24 months (62.6% vs 50.2%, Δ12.5%) and at 30 months 
(60.4% vs 44.4%, Δ16.0%). The difference in RFS rate between the nivolumab group and ipilimumab 
group was increasing and remained stable over time. The lower limit of the confidence intervals of the 
difference in RFS rate are above 0 for every time-period, which points at a numerical advantage of the 
nivolumab over the ipilimumab arm. The results are considered clinically relevant against an active 
comparator ipilimumab.  
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 84/92 
 
  
  
For the secondary endpoint RFS by PD-L1 expression, it was demonstrated that both subjects with 
higher (≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥10%) and lower (<1%, <5% and <10%) pre-defined PD-L1 expression levels 
had a lower risk of recurrence for nivolumab vs ipilimumab. Patients with higher PD-L1 expression 
levels showed a lower risk (HR-range 0.54-0.61) than the patients with lower levels of PD-L1 
expression (HR-range 0.71-0.78).  
The exploratory endpoint DMFS, demonstrated a superior effect of nivolumab compared to ipilimumab 
(HR = 0.73 [95%CI: 0.55, 0.95]; stratified log-rank p = 0.0). DMFS rates were higher in the 
nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group at 6 months (87.5% vs 82.9%, Δ4.6%), at 12 months 
(80.1% vs 72.7%, Δ7.4%), at 18 months (75.2% vs 67.1%, Δ8.1%) and at 24 months (70.5% vs 
63.7%, Δ6.8%). Superior DMFS was seen consistently for nivolumab compared to ipilimumab at the 
updated analysis (HR=0.76 [95% CI; 0.59, 0.98; stratified log-rank p = 0.0340]).  
As an additional post-hoc analysis, PFS2 data and an improvement in PFS on next line therapy was 
seen for nivolumab compared to ipilimumab (HR=0.74 [CI:0.57,0.97]; stratified log-rank p = 0.0302). 
Although not yet mature, descriptive OS data showed no detrimental effect of nivolumab on survival 
relative to ipilimumab. 
An analysis of the effect of BRAF mutation status on RFS showed no impact in both nivolumab and 
ipilimumab treated patients.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
With the minimal follow-up of 24 months the data is not mature to determine if an increase in RFS and 
DMFS will translate into a positive impact on OS, and as a result increase the cure rates, or if the 
treatment will only delay the progression of the disease. RFS does not yet present a plateau in KM 
curve and RFS has not yet been established as a surrogate endpoint for OS in adjuvant melanoma as it 
has been demonstrated in other types of tumours (e.g. breast cancer). Although it is reassuring that 
nivolumab treatment suggest no detriment on OS, the uncertainty remains as to whether patients will 
have a beneficial treatment effect in the long term and if so, what would be the extent of the 
magnitude of the treatment effect of nivolumab in patients with resectable disease treated for adjuvant 
melanoma. As a result, the MAH has committed to submit the final  OS analyses as a condition in 
Annex II and RFS/DMFS as a post-authorisation measure.    
There were uncertainties concerning the RFS benefit of patients with PD-L1 expression <1% with 
nivolumab over ipilimumab, as the separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves was not as clear as in the 
other PD-L1 expression subgroups and the HR 95% CI encompassed 1.0. The updated analyses 
confirmed that the effect on RFS and DMFS in patient with low PD-L1 expression is low (RFS) to none 
(DMFS). The PD-L1 expression is defined using the percentage of PD-L1 staining on tumour cells, while 
the efficacy might also be related to PD-L1 expression on tumour-associated inflammatory cells (or a 
combination of both). Whether the expression of PD-L1 on these inflammatory cells is correlated to 
efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma remains to be determined. In addition, since the 
identification of biomarkers, other than PD-L1 expression on tumours, are still lacking that would allow 
a better selection of the patient population which would be most at risk and would have the best 
response to treatment, the MAH has committed to further investigate the value of biomarkers other 
than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, 
and associated cut offs, that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to 
treatment based on PD-L1 (on tumour- and tumour associated immune cells), PD-L2, tumour 
infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, Tumour mutational 
burden) as predictive of nivolumab adjuvant therapy efficacy. This has been included as an obligation 
in Annex II.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data of nivolumab monotherapy in adjuvant melanoma is considered similar to nivolumab 
monotherapy in metastatic melanoma as well as in other tumour types. In general, the ADRs identified 
in the current trial are consistent with the known ADRs for nivolumab treatment.  
In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported AEs were fatigue (42.7%), diarrhoea (36.9%), 
pruritus (28.1%), rash (25.4%), headache (23.5%), and nausea (23.0%) and the most frequently 
reported drug-related AEs were fatigue (34.5%), diarrhoea (24.3%), and pruritus (23.2%). 
In the dataset of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma (n = 
452), the most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were fatigue (46%), rash (29%), diarrhoea (24%), 
pruritus (23%), nausea (15%), arthralgia (13%), musculoskeletal pain (11%), and hypothyroidism 
(11%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). 
Any grade adverse events in the nivolumab group occurred with a similar frequency as in the 
ipilimumab group (96.9% vs 98.5%, respectively). With respect to the drug-related adverse events, 
fewer adverse events were observed in the nivolumab group (All grade 85.2 vs 95.8% and 3-4 grade 
14.4%% and 45.9%, for nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively). Grade 3-4 events occurred less 
frequently in subject treated with nivolumab compared to ipilimumab (25.4% vs 55.2%, respectively).  
The overall frequencies of SAEs (17.5% vs 40.4%) and drug-related SAEs (5.3% vs 31.1%) were 
lower in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were 
reported in approximately 3.3% in the nivolumab groups, while 24.5% of the subjects in the 
ipilimumab group experienced Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs. 
For the categories of gastrointestinal, hepatic, skin and endocrine SOCs,all grade select AEs detected 
less (gastrointestinal, 25.2% vs 48.3%; hepatic, 9.1% vs 21.2% and skin, 44.5% vs 59.8%) or equal 
(endocrine, 22.6% vs 21.2%) numbers of drug-related select AEs in the nivolumab group compared to 
the ipilimumab group.  
No deaths in the nivolumab group were attributed to the study drug toxicity.    
The majority of the immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs) in the nivolumab group were grade 1-2, while in 
the ipilimumab group the majority are grade 3-4. Only the grade 1-2 IMAEs on 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism occured more often in the nivolumab group (13.9% 
and 8.6% vs 9.1% and 4.9% respectively), while grade 3-4 IMAEs in the rash (Niv: 0.7%; Ipi: 4.8%), 
diarrhea/colitis (Niv 2%: ; Ipi: 17.2%), hepatitis (Niv: 2%; Ipi: 7.5%), and hypophysitis (Niv: 0.4%; 
Ipi: 4.2%) categories occurred more frequently in the ipilimumab group.  
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.7% of subjects in the nivolumab group 
and 41.7% of subjects in the ipilimumab group. 
In addition, the amount of administered immune-modulating concomitant medication for the 
management of AEs is higher in subjects in the ipilimumab group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no new safety concerns identified during the conduct of the clinical trial. Hence, there are 
no uncertainties on the unfavourable effects. 
The majority of the immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs) in the nivolumab group were grade 1-2, while in 
the ipilimumab group the majority are grade 3-4. Only the grade 1-2 IMAEs on 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism occured more often in the nivolumab group (13.9% 
and 8.6% vs 9.1% and 4.9% respectively), while grade 3-4 IMAEs in the rash (Niv: 0.7%; Ipi: 4.8%), 
diarrhea/colitis (Niv 2%: ; Ipi: 17.2%), hepatitis (Niv: 2%; Ipi: 7.5%), and hypophysitis (Niv: 0.4%; 
Ipi: 4.2%) categories occurred more frequently in the ipilimumab group. In both groups the majority 
of the events seemed manageable but required lifelong treatment for thyroid replacement therapy.

Therefore, it is important that the treating physician is able to identify the symptoms rapidly and 
initiate the administration of immune-modulation medication as soon as possible in order to limit any 
irreversible damage in this patient population with early stage of the disease that may be cured and 
have a prolonged lifespan.  
There are no data on adjuvant treatment in patients with melanoma with the following risk factors (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.1):patients with prior autoimmune disease, and any condition requiring systemic 
treatment with either corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other 
immunosuppressive medications; patients with prior therapy for melanoma (except patients with 
surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy after neurosurgical resection for lesions of the central nervous system, 
and prior adjuvant interferon completed ≥ 6 months prior to randomisation); patients treated with prior 
therapy with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti CTLA-4 antibody (including 
ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint 
pathways); subjects under the age of 18 years. In the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with 
caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual 
basis. A warning has been included in the SmPC section 4.4.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with Stage III and IV melanoma are at high risk of recurrence and are therefore candidates 
for adjuvant treatment after complete resection of all detectable disease. In line with Guideline on the 
evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5), the main goal of 
adjuvant therapy is to provide long-term benefit in terms of an increase in OS. 
The clinical data established a clinically relevant benefit for RFS, the primary endpoint, which was 
supported by subgroup analysis based on PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation status. The exploratory 
endpoint DMFS and PFS2 also showed a favourable effect in favour of nivolumab treatment compared 
to ipilimumab. Although the data is not mature, the descriptive OS presented showed no detrimental 
effect so far.  
The safety data showed no new safety concerns. The ADRs are considered manageable with the 
recommendations in the SmPC, early identification and monitoring of immune-related adverse 
reactions, the use of immunosuppressive agents as well as the additional risk minimization measures. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Melanoma is generally considered to be incurable when distant metastases are present. Patients with 
unresectable and metastatic disease have a poor prognosis usually have a median survival of less than 
one year. Therefore, a prolonged period of disease- free and metastasis-free that could delay 
recurrence and/or metastatic progression would be an important clinical benefit for patients that are at 
high risk of relapsing. The pivotal trial has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful benefit of nivolumab adjuvant therapy in terms of RFS, which has shown a 7% gain in RFS 
in patients that go on to develop metastasis compared to ipilimumab adjuvant therapy. The members 
of the SAG-O confirmed the relevance of RFS as a clinically relevant endpoint for adjuvant treatment in 
melanoma. Although only an explorative endpoint, DMFS data provides supportive evidence that 
suggest a clinical benefit of nivolumab in the long term, that could potentially result into an OS 
advantage over time. This would be the ultimate goal, however the data is still too immature to reach 
any firm conclusions.

EMA/665778/2018 
Page 88/92 
 
  
  
 
 
The safety results confirm the known safety profile of nivolumab, which is acceptable in this 
asymptomatic patient population as the ADRs are manageable.  The overall safety profile of nivolumab 
3 mg/kg for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma (n = 452) was consistent with that established 
across tumour types for nivolumab monotherapy. There is some concern about the over-treatment of 
patients that will not experience a recurrence (and are cured already without an adjuvant therapy). 
However, it has been judged that the benefit of delaying progression and in some patients, reaching 
curative intent, outweighs the safety concerns which are generally manageable. It is recommended 
that the treating-physicians discuss the long term risks (such as hypothyroidism, endocrinopathies and 
other autoimmune-related ADRs) with their patients. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The trial CA209238 key inclusion criteria included the enrollment of adolescents and adult patients with 
Stage IIIB, IIIC and IV (per the AJCC 7th edition) histologically confirmed melanoma that is completely 
surgically resected. However, as the AJCC staging has changed, it may be difficult to define the new 
patient population that would be representative of the patients that were included in the trial. Hence, 
the current wording of the indication was modified with a more general wording “….with melanoma 
with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection”, 
without the mentioning of specific disease stages. Keeping the new AJCC 8th edition in mind, the 
current trial included patients with a wide range of prognostic estimates (including a proportion of 
patients in the “new” category IIIA, primary tumor ≤1.0mm with ulceration with regional lymph nodes 
involvement, clinically occult or detected (N1-2a)) and hence the indication reflects this distinction.  
As there were no data collected in the adolescent population and there is uncertainty concerning the 
extrapolation of the PK, PD, efficacy and safety data in this patient population, it was not agreed to 
include adolescents and the indication was restricted to adults only. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Opdivo is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
To understand the value of PD-L1 expression in the tumour and on the infiltrating immune cells it is 
essential to analyse PD-L1 expression on the infiltrating immune cells as well to correlate the 
expression of PD-L1 on the infiltrating inflammatory cells (and the PD-L1 expression on both tumour 
cells and inflammatory cells) with efficacy. There are uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a 
nivolumab  in certain sub-populations that could not be resolved prior to marketing authorisation and 
require further clinical evidence. Therefore, the MAH has committed to investigate the predictive value 
of biomarkers for the efficacy of nivolumab, which has been included as condition to the MA in Annex 
IID.  
1.  To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour 
cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut offs, that might 
prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1 (on 
tumour- and tumour associated immune cells), PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with 
measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, Tumour mutational burden) as predictive of 
nivolumab adjuvant therapy efficacy. This will be provided for the approved indications: 
−  Adjuvant treatment of melanoma (monotherapy): study CA209238 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/665778/2018 
Page 89/92 
 
  
  
 
As the efficacy assessment in terms of OS is based partially on the assumption that the surrogate 
endpoints (RFS and MDSF) may lead to an improvement on OS in the long term, it would be important 
to confirm the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression. Therefore, the 
final RFS/DMFS analysis is expected to be performed in 2019 and the final OS analysis is expected to 
be performed in 2020 and the final study report of the RFS, DMFS and OS should be submitted for 
assessment.  
2.  The MAH should submit the final OS data for study CA209238: A Phase 3, randomised double-
blind study of OPDIVO versus Yervoy in patients who have undergone complete resection of 
Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV melanoma. , due 4Q2020.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The Product information has been updated following 5 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) reported within 
data 
approximately a week (up to 11 days) after Zolgensma 
administration. TMA is an acute and life-threatening 
condition characterised by thrombocytopenia, haemolytic 
anaemia and acute kidney injury that can resolve with 
timely and proper intervention. 
In addition to a warning in section 4.4 and addition of TMA 
in section 4.8, section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated 
to include baseline measurements of creatinine and blood 
count to provide individual baseline values in case of 
suspected TMA. If patients show clinical signs, symptoms or 
laboratory findings consistent with TMA, it is recommended 
that a specialist is consulted immediately to manage TMA 
as clinically indicated. Caregivers should be informed about 
signs and symptoms of TMA and should be advised to seek 
urgent medical care if such symptoms occur.

Study BO25341 (SAWYER), the risk management plan 
(RMP) has been updated to remove the following safety 
concerns: 
- Immunogenicity associated with the subcutaneous 
formulation (NHL/CLL) 
- Prolonged B-cell depletion 
The study formed the basis for demonstrating that 
rituximab SC results in Ctrough levels was non inferior to 
rituximab IV for the dose and dosing interval used in the 
treatment of CLL and no new safety concerns have been 
identified with the long-term follow-up.

rituximab are well characterized and the risk associated 
with administering faster infusions of rituximab were similar 
to or lower than the corresponding incidence rates from the 
weighted historical controls (8.1%, 11.5%, and 5.0%), 
respectively.  The MAH has proposed changes to the SmPC 
section 4.2 and 4.8; section 4.2 to provide specific 
guidance on the administration of rituximab according to 
the faster infusion schedule that was followed in Study 
ML25641, and section 4.8 to state that nothing new was 
observed in relation to IRRs from this study. The MAH is 
also asked to confirm that the stated concentration of the 
solution to be used for the faster infusion time is identical 
to what is normally used for first infusion. The proposed 
changes were further revised by the CHMP and are now

contribution of rituximab could not be excluded. This is 
already reflected in the SmPC in section 4.8. At that time, 
no evidence of rituximab association in PRES in the 
autoimmune indications was found, therefore for 
rheumatoid arthritis PRES was not considered as an 
adverse drug reaction.  
In this variation an updated drug safety report concludes 
that no causal relationship with rituximab has been 
established for the autoimmune indications. PRES is 
reported very rarely with rituximab. The data and 
information do not confirm a clear causality but a 
contributive role of rituximab is possible due to the 
temporal relationship, although all cases with sufficient 
information reported notable additional risk factors for 
PRES. 
The proposed update to section 4.8 is considered to 
adequately reflect the data submitted, and the variation is 
recommended for a positive opinion. The newly submitted 
data do not change the overall benefit/risk which remains 
positive.

over observation both in terms of the primary endpoint PFS 
and in terms of the secondary endpoints event-free 
survival, overall response, time to next anti-lymphoma 
treatment, and time to next chemotherapy is considered 
clinically significant. Still, no difference in overall survival is 
observed. The number of deaths in the study remains too 
low to make definitive conclusions on OS at this time 
(stratified HR 1.02, p  0.8960, log-rank test). Longer

the duration of survival follow-up until the end of 2016 in 
order to collect additional longer-term data on survival. 
This data should be submitted for assessment.

Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal

Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens- Johnson Syndrome (SJS) 
have been very rarely reported in patients with 
autoimmune diseases with both first-time use and with 
later infusions.  
Some of the cases occurred on the day of dosing or within 
a few days of dosing. In other cases, the event occurred 
weeks or up to four months after the dose. Four of the 
cases in autoimmune patients had a close association in 
time to MabThera dosing (starting on the day of dosing or 
the next day), of which one case of TEN had a fatal 
outcome. In several of the cases in autoimmune patients, 
treatments known to be possibly associated with Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis and Stevens- Johnson Syndrome were 
given concomitantly with MabThera therapy. The 
mechanism of these reactions remains unknown. 
Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases, of TEN 
have been reported very rarely in patients with 
haematological malignancies.  This information was already 
included in the MabThera product information, which is now 
being updated to reflect the new safety information and to 
advise that if severe skin reactions occur, MabThera 
treatment should be discontinued.

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
now resulted in a variation to update section 5.1.  
The data presented in this dossier from an additional three 
years of follow-up beyond that for the primary analysis of 
study ML17102 continue to demonstrate clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvements in PFS 
and OS for patients with previously untreated CLL when 
treated with R-FC compared to FC alone.  
PFS was significantly improved in the R-FC arm compared 
to the FC arm (adjusted HR 0.55, p < 0.0001, Wald test), 
consistent with the results of the primary analysis. The 
median PFS in the R-FC arm increased from 39.8 months to 
55.3 months with extended follow-up, while that in the FC 
arm was similar over time (32.2 months vs 32.8 months). 
OS was significantly improved in the R-FC arm compared to 
the FC arm (adjusted HR 0.73, p = 0.0304, Wald test). 
Although the hazard ratio has increased over time (from 
0.64 to 0.73), which is most likely related to an increasing 
imbalance between treatment arms with respect to 
receiving non-protocol rituximab-containing regimens, the 
trend of improved survival in favor of the R-FC arm was 
confirmed with extended follow-up. 
The clinical benefits seen in PFS and OS in the overall 
population were also observed in most of the patient 
subgroups analyzed. In particular, the risk of disease 
progression/ relapse or death among patients with Binet 
stage C disease reached statistical significance with 
extended follow-up (HR 0.68, p = 0.0224, Wald test). 
There were no new or unexpected safety signals with 
extended follow-up, thus confirming the known safety 
profile of rituximab in combination with FC chemotherapy. 
Therefore, the benefit/risk ratio for rituximab in 
combination with FC chemotherapy for the first-line

considered that efficacy data to support the 1st and 2nd 
line treatment was insufficient. However the CHMP 
considered acceptable to update section 4.1 with 
information on improvement in physical function and 
reduction in the rate of joint damage as measured by x-
ray, when given in combination with methotrexate and 
sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 have been updated as a 
consequence. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
In addition to this, sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated with additional information from studies in 
patients with early arthritis.

In addition, the overall safety profile of MabThera in 
rheumatoid arthritis under section 4.8 is now presented 
based on data from patients from clinical trials and from 
post-marketing surveillance. The safety information 
collected during post marketing experience reflects the

Based on the subgroup dataset of Study IDEC 102-05, 
baseline CD19+ cell counts (CD19) and the sum of the 
product of perpendicular diameters (SPD) were the most 
significant covariates influencing CL2. The overall effects of 
covariates in the final model explained approximately 27% 
of the inter-individual variability in CL2. SPD was the most 
significant covariate influencing Kdes, but explained only 
approximately 6% of the inter-individual variability for Kdes 
in the final model. The large inter-individual variability on 
CL2 and Kdes remained after the inclusion of the CD19 and 
Page 47/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SPD covariates in the PK model. It is possible that the 
longitudinal SPD and CD19 data, which were not included in 
this analysis, might explain some of the remaining 
variability. 
Body surface area (BSA) was the most significant covariate 
influencing V1 and explained approximately 30% of the 
inter-individual variability in V1. The addition of covariate 
factors as predictors of variability in rituximab 
pharmacokinetics did not reduce unexplained inter-
individual variability in CL1 and V1. It is possible that other 
covariate factors, not included in this analysis, might 
explain some of the remaining variability. 
The clinical relevance of this finding is that dose adjustment 
for known covariates (e.g, BSA) is not expected to result in 
a meaningful reduction in PK variability. Age, sex and WHO 
performance status had no statistically significant effect on 
the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. 
The section 5.2 "Pharmacokinetic Properties" is amended 
accordingly.

In February 2007, the CHMP requested that the European 
Package Leaflet 
Marketing Authorisation Holder, Roche, issue a DDL across 
the EU concerning the two reported cases of PML.  
Subsequently a new case of PML in a vasculitis patient was 
reported and the DDL was revised and issued as of 2 April 
2007. The current variation is to update section 4.4. of the 
SPC and also section 4 of the PIL with appropriate wording 
covering PML in Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and autoimmune 
diseases. 
Page 48/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since then, the position on the interpretation of PML cases 
reported in NHL patients has not changed. However, 
considering the severity of the conditions and the proposal 
to update the "Warnings" Section of the SPC with a 
statement regarding the observed cases of PML with off-
label use of rituximab in SLE/vasculits patients, it is 
appropriate to include a text on PML in the "Warnings" 
Section of the SPC, in addition to the text in the post-
marketing experience of the "Undesirable Effects" section.

or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, 
structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and 
expressed as change in modified total Sharp score and its 
components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing 
score. Patients originally receiving rituximab/MTX 
demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression 
than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at 56 
weeks. Of the patients originally receiving methotrexate 
alone, 81% received rituximab either as rescue between 
weeks 16-24 or in the extension trial, before week 56. A 
higher proportion of patients receiving the original 
rituximab/MTX treatment also had no erosive progression 
over 56 weeks (61% vs 52%). The present study has 
shown that rituximab has the ability to slow down the 
progression of structural damage in patients with active RA 
who had previously failed anti-TNF treatment. This effect is 
predominately seen in patients who possess RF or are anti-
CCP positive. The study population comprised patients with 
high inflammatory activity as measured by DAS28 score

showed consistently that rituximab was significantly

score and joint space narrowing.

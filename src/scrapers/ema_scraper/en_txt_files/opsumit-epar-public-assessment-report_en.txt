2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pulmonary  Arterial  Hypertension  (PAH)  is  a  chronic  and  progressive  disease  of  the  small 
pulmonary  arteries  that  is  characterised  by  vascular  proliferation  and  remodelling.  It  results  in 
increased  pulmonary  artery  pressure  and  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and,  ultimately,  right 
ventricular  heart  failure  and  death.  Although  the  pathogenesis  of  PAH  is  not  completely 
understood, it likely involves an imbalance in the normal relationships between vasodilators and 
vasoconstrictors, growth inhibitors and mitogenic factors, and antithrombotic and prothrombotic 
determinants  that  are  probably  consequences  of  pulmonary  endothelial  cell  dysfunction  and/or 
injury.   
PAH  is  defined  by  right-heart  catheterization  showing  a  precapillary  pulmonary  hypertension 
(mean  pulmonary  artery  pressure  >  25  mmHg  at  rest  or  >  30  mmHg  with  exercise,  with  a 
pulmonary  artery  wedge  pressure  <  15  mmHg).  There  is  a  female-to-male  preponderance 
(1.7:1),  with  patients  most  commonly  presenting  in  the  third  and  fourth  decades,  although  the 
age range is from infancy to greater than 60 years.  
The  annual  incidence  of  idiopathic  pulmonary  hypertension  has  been  estimated  within  1  or  2 
cases per million individuals per year. This is well within the criteria defined for the prevalence of 
orphan diseases.  
The median life expectancy from the time of the diagnosis in patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), 
before  the  availability  of  disease-specific  (targeted)  therapy,  was  2.8  years  through  the  mid-
1980. PAH is a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis.  
Current clinical classification of PAH comprises apparently heterogeneous conditions, which share 
comparable  clinical  and  hemodynamic  pictures  and  virtually  identical  pathologic  changes  of  the 
lung  microcirculation.  PAH  includes  idiopathic  (IPAH,  formerly  termed  primary  pulmonary 
hypertension) and familial forms (FPAH), PAH associated with various conditions (APAH), such as 
scleroderma and other connective tissue diseases (CTD), congenital heart defects with systemic-
to-pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus infection, exposure to 
drugs  and  toxins  and  other  more  rare  settings:  thyroid  disorders,  glycogen  storage  disease, 
Gaucher´s  disease,  hereditary  hemorrhagic  telangiectasia,  hemoglobinopathies  (Sickle  disease 
especially), myelo-proliferative disorders, splenectomy, PAH associated with significant venous or 
capillary involvement and finally, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 
The functional classification is the measure of the limits imposed on a patient by a disease. It is a 
critical  element  of  the  assessment  of  patients  with  PAH.  There  are  two  classification  systems 
that, in practice, are used interchangeably when characterizing patients with PAH:  
A. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification  
• Class 1: No symptoms with ordinary physical activity. 
• Class 2: Symptoms with ordinary activity. Slight limitation of activity. 
• Class 3: Symptoms with less than ordinary activity. Marked limitation of activity. 
• Class 4: Symptoms with any activity or even at rest. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 11/105 
 
  
  
 
B. World Health Organization (WHO) functional assessment classification  
• Class I: Patients with PH but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary 
physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. 
• Class II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or 
near syncope. 
• Class III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, 
or near syncope. 
• Class IV: Patients with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. 
These patients manifest signs of right-heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be 
present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity. 
Variables  associated  with  poor  survival  includes,  among  others,  a  NYHA/WHO  Functional  Class 
(FC) III or IV and the presence of Raynaud’s phenomenon.  Patients with a NYHA/WHO Class I or 
II  have  a  median  survival  of  59  months  (approximately  5  years),  while  patients  with  a 
NYHA/WHO  Class  III  have  a  median  survival  of  32  months  (2.6 years),  and  patients  with  a 
NYHA/WHO Class IV have a median survival of 6 months.  For Primary Pulmonary Hypertension 
(PPH),  the  US  National  Institute  of  Health  (NIH)  registry  showed  survival  rates  for  untreated 
patients  of  68%,  48%,  and  34%  after  1,  3,  and  5  years  from  diagnosis,  respectively.  Although 
advances  in  therapies  and  patient  management  have  improved  these  rates,  there  is  still  no 
known cure for PPH or other forms of PAH. 
Symptoms  of  PAH  include  dyspnoea  (most  commonly),  fatigue,  chest  pain  or  discomfort, 
dizziness,  syncope,  near  syncope,  edema,  leg  edema,  and  palpitations.    When  the  disease  is 
advanced,  the  clinical  manifestations  include  cyanosis,  dyspnoea  on  exertion,  hemoptysis, 
atypical  chest  pain  or  angina  pectoris,  syncope,  heart  failure,  arrhythmias  and  cerebrovascular 
accidents.  
General  measures  recommended  for  patients  with  PAH  is  to  engage  in  activities  appropriate  to 
their physical capabilities in order to prevent deconditioning and worsening of overall function. At 
present,  conventional  treatment  for  patients  with  PAH  includes  calcium-channel  blockers, 
anticoagulants, diuretics and oxygen. In addition, two phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, 
tadalafil),  two  oral  endothelin-receptor  antagonists  (ERA)  (bosentan,  ambrisentan),  an 
intravenous  prostacyclin  (epoprostenol),  an  inhaled  prostacylin  (iloprost)  and  a  subcutaneous 
prostacyclin (treprostinil) have also been licensed for the treatment of PAH in  various European 
countries.  Of  these,  sildenafil  (Revatio®),  tadalafil  (Adcirca®),  bosentan  (Tracleer®), 
ambrisentan  (Volibris®)  and  iloprost  (Ventavis®)  have  been  authorised  through  the  centralised 
procedure. Sildenafil, tadalafil and ambrisentan are indicated for patients with primary and CTD-
associated  PAH,  while  bosentan  is  indicated  for  patients  with  primary  PAH,  scleroderma-
associated  PAH,  and  PAH  associated  to  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and 
Eisenmenger’s physiology. Iloprost is indicated only for patients with primary PAH. Four of these 
medicinal products are licensed for patients with NYHA FC II and III disease severity (sildenafil, 
tadalafil, bosentan and ambrisentan), whereas the remaining ones are licensed for patients with

NYHA class III only. An additional ERA, sitaxentan (Thelin®), was withdrawn from the market in 
2010 due to concerns about liver toxicity. 
Macitentan 
(ACT-064992)(N-[5-(4-Bromophenyl)-6-[2-[(5-bromo-2-pyrimidinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-4-
pyrimidinyl]-N'-propylsulfamide) is an orally active, dual endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist. In 
vitro, macitentan selectively inhibits the binding of ET-1 to ET A and ETB receptors as well as the 
effects mediated by these receptors in functional assays.  
Macitentan  belongs  to  the  class  of  endothelin  receptor  antagonists  (ERA),  but  has  a  molecular 
structure,  physicochemical  properties,  receptor-binding  kinetics,  and  efficacy  in  nonclinical 
models that differentiate it from previously authorized compounds. 
The  selection  of  macitentan  for  development  as  a  dual  ERA  was  further  guided  by  the 
compound’s pharmacokinetic characteristics which are consistent with once-daily (OD) dosing, its 
favourable  drug-drug  interaction  profile,  and  its  low  propensity  to  inhibit  intrahepatic  bile  salt 
transport, which is believed by the applicant to translate into a favourable liver safety profile. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Opsumit  is  a  film-coated  tablet  containing  an  active  substance  not  previously  authorised  in  the 
EU at the time of the submission of this application. 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets, containing 10 mg of macitentan. Other 
ingredients  are:  lactose  monohydrate,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  sodium  starch  glycolate, 
povidone,  magnesium  stearate,  polysorbate  80,  polyvinyl  alcohol,  titanium  dioxide,  talc,  soya 
lecithin, xanthan gum (see section 6.1 of the SmPC). 
The product is available in blisters and bottles as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  substance  macitentan  appears  as  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder  insoluble  in 
water and aqueous solutions in room temperature at pH 1.2, 4, 6.8, 7, 9 and is slightly soluble in 
methanol and ethanol. 
The 
chemical 
name 
of  macitentan 
is 
N-[5-(4-Bromophenyl)-6-[2-[(5-bromo-2-
pyrimidinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-4-pyrimidinyl]-N'-propylsulfamide,  corresponding 
to 
the  structural 
formula below: 
The molecular formula is C 19H20Br2N6O4S  and its relative molecular mass 588.27 g/mol. Its pKa 
is 6.2 and the partition coefficient LogD is 2.9 (lipophilic). The molecule is achiral thus having no

stereoisomers.  Several  polymorphic  forms  have  been  described  including  different  solvates.  All 
macitentan batches manufactured so far for clinical studies and commercial purposes correspond 
to the same stable polymorphic form which is a true polymorph with a melting point of 135°C. It 
is the thermodynamically most stable form at room temperature. Long-term stability studies on 
several clinical and registration batches showed no polymorphic change of macitentan after up to 
36 months of storage at 30 °C / 65% RH. Results of the dynamic vapour sorption of macitentan 
show that it is not hygroscopic.

Manufacture 
Macitentan  is  manufactured  in  three  chemical  steps  and  a  last  milling  step,  which  were  all 
described  in  sufficient  detail.  A  flow  diagram  for  the  synthesis  of  macitentan  is  provided, 
including  starting  materials,  intermediates,  solvents  and  reagents  for  each  stage.  The  rationale 
for  the  choice  of  the  starting  materials  is  considered  acceptable.  The  manufacturing  process 
development  includes  a  detailed  description  of  the  optimisation  steps  for  the  active  substance. 
The  two  last  chemical  steps  were  optimised  thereby  limiting  the  formation  of  impurities  and 
increasing the yield. The applicant has applied the design of experiments approach and applied a 
multivariate analysis with the identified key parameters of the process step. Adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products,  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented.  The  characterisation  of  the 
active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin 
and  characterisation.  Batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  active  substance  can  be  manufactured 
reproducibly. 
Specification 
Macitentan specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), colour (visual), clarity 
and  colour  of  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (IR,  HPLC),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy 
metals  (Ph. Eur.),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  residual  solvents  (GC),  related  substances  (HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), particle size distribution (laser light diffraction) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).  
Potential  impurities  that  could  be  present  in  the  starting  material  are  either  controlled  in  the 
starting  material  itself  or  in  the  intermediate.  Potential  genotoxic  impurities  were  evaluated  for 
genotoxic  concern  by  in  silico  QSAR  analyses  for  those  showing  genotoxic  alerts.  The  results  of 
these analyses showed no concern.  The potential genotoxicity of the starting material has been 
further investigated and was found negative in a full Ames test.  The calculated TTC is 150ppm 
(10mg  daily  dose),  however  the  starting  material  was  not  detected  in  the  last  two  campaigns. 
Since  the  starting  material  was  found  negative  in  the  Ames  test,  negative  results  from  the  in 
silico  genotoxicity  predictions  on  its  impurities  are  enough  to  consider  them  too  as  non-
genotoxic.  Therefore,  no  routine  controls  below  the  TTC  value  are  deemed  necessary  for  these 
two impurities on the starting material or on the active substance. 
Overall,  the  discussion  on  the  potential  genotoxic  impurities  is  considered  sufficient.  The  limits 
for impurities are in line with European Guidance (NfG on impurities - ICH topic Q3A (R2). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately  validated  in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  registration  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability 
The stability of macitentan active substance was investigated on three registration batches under 
accelerated (40 °C / 75% RH) and long-term (30 °C / 65% RH) storage conditions. 
Stability  data  of  another  three  clinical  batches  were  produced  by  the  same  manufacturer  using 
the same route of synthesis as the registration batches were also presented as supportive data.

During  stability  testing  the  following  characteristics  are  tested:  appearance,  colour,  clarity  and 
colour  of  a  solution,  water,  assay,  related  substances,  microbial  quality  (not  routinely  tested), 
and  particle  size  distribution  (not  routinely  tested).  All  analytical  methods  were  the  same  as 
those used at release; they were shown to be stability indicating.  
After storage for six months at 40 °C / 75% RH and 48 months at 30 °C / 65% RH, no change in 
the physical and chemical characteristics was observed. 
Photostability  testing  (forced  degradation  testing  according  ICH  Q1B)  was  carried  out  on  one 
batch  in  line  with  the  relevant  Guideline  ICH  Topic  Q1B  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Active 
Substances  and  Medicinal  Products.  A  confirmatory  photostability  study  was  performed  on  one 
recent  batch.  The  results  were  consistent  with  those  obtained  from  the  initial  studies  and  show 
macitentan  is  stable  to  light  in  the  solid  state  but  degradation  was  observed  in  solution  in  all 
solvents tested. The method is considered stability indicating. 
Overall, the stability data support the proposed retest period and storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Prior  to  the  initiation  of  formulation  development  studies,  an  excipient  compatibility  study  with 
the  active  substance  was  performed.  It  was  concluded  that  all  excipients  investigated  could  be 
used for further development. The selected excipients are well-known for use in pharmaceutical 
products and are commonly used excipients in film-coated tablet formulations.  
A  capsule  formulation  in  different  strengths  was  initially  developed  to  provide  dose  flexibility. 
This  formulation  was  used  in  early  Phase  1  studies  as  well  as  in  one  Phase  2  study.  For  the  
formulation and manufacturing process development the physicochemical properties of the active 
substance  were  taken  into  account.  A  tablet  formulation  was  developed  from  the  capsule  and 
was  optimised  with  regard  to  the  effect  of  key  formulation  attributes  on  stability  and  tablet 
characteristics.    The  dissolution  profiles  of  10 mg  capsule  and  10 mg  film-coated  tablets  were 
compared  and  were  found  equivalent.  In  addition,  a  clinical  pharmacology  comparison  study 
between macitentan 10 mg capsules and macitentan 10 mg film-coated tablets was performed in 
healthy  subjects.  The  study  showed  that  the  PK  of  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  were 
comparable  for  the  two  formulations.  Given  that  the  intended  use  is  a  chronic,  multiple-dose 
regimen, the minor difference found in Cmax of macitentan between the two formulations was not 
considered  relevant.  The  results  adequately  supported  comparability  of  data  obtained  with  the 
two  formulations  and  that  no  dose  adaptation  was  needed  when  switching  from  the  capsule  to 
the tablet formulation in the development of the product. The film-coated tablets were therefore 
used in clinical Phases 1, 2 and 3. 
The dissolution method has been shown to be discriminatory with regard to the factors that can 
vary  during  manufacture  and  are  likely  to  or  have  shown  to  affect  the  performance  and  with 
regard to distinguishing tablets which have been exposed to accelerated or inappropriate storage 
conditions. 
According to ICH Q6A guideline, the specification for solid oral dosage forms normally includes a 
test  to  measure  the  release  of  active  substance  from  the  finished  product.  According  to  the 
decision  tree  #7(1),  a  single-point  dissolution  acceptance  criterion  with  a  lower  limit  was 
included in the specifications for Opsumit. 
Assessment report

Following  the  selection  of  the  wet  granulation  method  the  process  has  been  optimised  with 
regard  to  the  granulation  parameters  and  the  tablet  characteristics.  The  manufacturing 
parameters  were  further  adapted  as  appropriate  for  the  equipment  intended  for  full-scale 
manufacture at proposed site for commercial manufacture. The process used is not associated to 
conditions  that  could  generate  a  conversion  of  the  desired  polymorphic  form    of  the  active 
substance into other polymorphs. 
Adventitious agents 
The manufacturing processes of neither the active substance nor the finished product involve any 
materials of human or animal origin apart from lactose, which fulfils the necessary requirements. 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition 
as  those  used  to  collect  milk  for  human  consumption  and  that  the  lactose  has  been  prepared 
without  the  use of  ruminant  material  other  than  calf  rennet  according to  the Note  for  Guidance 
on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  Via  Human 
and veterinary medicinal products. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacture  of  macitentan  film-coated  tablets  involves  conventional  wet  granulation  and 
coating  processes.  No  critical  steps  were  identified.  However,  suitable  in-process  controls  have 
been  introduced  at  each  manufacturingstep  to  ensure  reproducible  quality  for  the  finished 
product.  The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described  and  as  it  is  considered  to  be  a 
standard  process,  validation  data  do  not  have  to  be  incorporated  in  the  dossier  before 
registration.  A  satisfactory  process  validation  protocol  has  been  submitted.  The  process 
validation  at  commercial  scale  will  be  performed  by  the  proposed  manufacturer  prior  to 
marketing the product. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance  and  colour 
(visual), identification (HPLC and IR), water content (Ph. Eur.), tablet mass (gravimetry), assay 
(HPLC),  content  uniformity  (Ph.  Eur.),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately  validated  in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch  analysis  results  are  submitted  for  three  registration batches.  The  batch  analysis  data  are 
within the set specification limits and show that Opsumit film-coated tablets can be manufactured 
reproducibly. 
Stability of the product 
The stability of Opsumit 10 mg film-coated tablets was investigated in three registration batches 
stored  in  the  both  proposed  blister  and  bottle  packaging  intended  for  the  market  under 
accelerated (40°C ±2°C / 75% ±5% RH) and long term conditions (25°C ±2°C / 60% ±5% RH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013

and 30°C ±2°C / 75% ±5%RH). All relevant characteristics such as appearance, colour, average 
mass  of  10  tablets,  water  content,  content,  dissolution,  degradation  products  and  microbial 
quality were determined. The HPLC methods used are identical to those used for the release and 
have been shown to be stability indicating. 
Up  to  18  months  data  were  available  and  no  significant  changes  of  the  physical,  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical characteristics were observed.  A  slight  increase  of  the  level  of  the  main 
degradation product is observed after three months at 40 °C/ 75% RH. However under long term 
conditions  no  significant  changes  of  the  physical,  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  characteristics 
were observed.  
In addition, up to 60 months supportive stability data were presented from the clinical batches. 
These  batches  were  produced  by  a  different  manufacturer  but  have  the  same  composition  and 
the same manufacturing process as the registration batches. The composition of the commercial 
film-coated tablets is also the same as the ones used in clinical studies. The blister of the clinical 
batches was different to that of the registration ones. 
A comparison was performed between the stability data from the clinical and registration batches 
for  each  packaging  configuration  (bottle,  blister)  and  storage  condition.  The  main  quality 
attributes susceptible to change during stability , i.e., assay, amount of degradation product and 
dissolution,  were  evaluated.  No  significant  change  in  the  dissolution  rate  is  observed  for  either 
the  clinical  or  the  registration  batches  packed  into  blisters.  Results  with  regard  to  the 
degradation between the clinical and the registration batches are similar. 
In-use  stability  testing  has  been  conducted  on  one  Opsumit  registration  batch  in  bottles. 
Appearance  of  the  tablets,  assay,  related  substances  as  well  as  dissolution  were  evaluated.  All 
methods used are the same as the analytical methods used at release. For all parameters tested, 
no significant difference is observed. 
Photostability  has  been  investigated  on  one  registration  batch  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q1B 
guideline.  During  photostability  testing  the  following  characteristics  were  tested:  appearance, 
colour, content and degradation products. All methods were the same as the analytical methods 
used at release and the results were evaluated against the current specifications. No significant 
differences  could  be  observed  between  the  samples  exposed  to  intense  light  and  the  control 
samples.  No  increase  in  related  substances  was  observed  in  any  of  the  samples.  Therefore, 
Opsumit  film-coated  tablets  can  be  considered  as  photostable  and  thus  in  accordance  with  the 
ICH Q1B guideline it is not necessary to store the finished product protected from light. 
Overall, the stability data support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  has  been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  Development  of  the  finished  product  had  to  take  into 
account  the  particular  characteristics  of  the  active  substance.  The  choice  of  formulation,  of 
excipients  and  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  justified.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out 
indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in 
turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

for  macitentan 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacology assays show that macitentan is able to inhibit the binding of endothelin-1 
(ET-1) to its receptors endothelin A (ETA) and endothelin B (ETB), to inhibit ETA or ETB receptor–
mediated  functional  responses  as  intracellular  accumulation  of  Ca  and  IP1  and  ET-1  induced 
contraction  of  isolated  tissues  (rat  aorta  and  trachea).  However,  the  free  therapeutic  plasma 
concentrations  of  macitentan  (2.5  nM)  is  in  the  range  of  the  concentration  that  causes  50% 
inhibition (IC50) and Kb values for the ETA receptor (IC50=0.5 nM, K b=0.81 nM), but it is lower 
than  the  values  for  the  ETB  receptor  (IC50=391  nM,  K b=128  nM).  Since  macitentan  is  highly 
bound to plasma protein, the Kb and IC50 for ETB receptor were calculated based on the unbound 
fraction  of  macitentan  in  the  culture  medium.  The  values  (IC50=13  nM,  K b=24  nM)  are  also 
higher than the free plasma concentrations of macitentan in PAH patients treated with 10 mg of 
macitentan.  Therefore,  based  on  in  vitro  studies  macitentan  can  be  regarded  as  an  ERA  that  is 
approximately  100-fold  more  selective  for  ETA  as  compared  to  ETB.  On  the  other  hand,  plasma 
ET-1  concentration,  a  marker  of  ETB  blockade,  was  increased  in  animals  and  humans  after 
treatment with macitentan, indicating that ETB receptor is inhibited by macitentan in vivo.

Macitentan has relatively slow dissociation kinetics, when compared to other products in its class 
(ambrisentan  and  bosentan).  This  results  in  a  prolonged  receptor  occupancy.  The  slow 
dissociation  of  macitentan  from  the  receptors  leads  to  an  inhibition  that  is  insurmountable  to 
(high  levels  of)  ET-1  when  macitentan  concentrations  are  >1-10  nM,  which  is  below  clinical 
plasma levels. In vivo pharmacodynamics studies were conducted in rats. The pharmacodynamic 
effects  of  macitentan  have  been  investigated  in  normal  rats  and  in  rat disease  models  in  which 
ET-1 plays a pathological role. 
Macitentan  reduced  systemic  arterial  blood  pressure  only  in  rat  models  of  hypertension 
associated with an increased expression of ET-1 (DOCA-salt and Dahl salt-sensitive rats) but not 
in  healthy  (normotensive)  rats  (with  no  activation  of  the  ET  system).  The  duration  of  this 
response depended on the dose. The data indicate that macitentan exhibits a sustained duration 
of action when compared to ambrisentan and bosentan. The slow release of macitentan from the 
receptor  and  the  fact  that  increases  in  ET-1  concentration  do  not  result  in  displacement  of 
macitentan  from  the  receptor,  as  well  as  the  formation  of  an  active  metabolite,  ACT-132577 
(M6), with a relatively long half-life time might all contribute to this difference. The dose at which 
maximal  effect  of  macitentan  treatment  was  observed  varied  somewhat  between  studies, 
however at 10 mg/kg maximal or almost maximal effects were seen. At this dose C max and AUC 
in the rat are within the range of those in humans receiving 10 mg. 
Two  circulating  macitentan  metabolites  have  been  identified  in  humans:  ACT-132577  (active 
metabolite  M6)  and  ACT-373898  (inactive  metabolite  on  endothelin  receptors M5).  ACT-132577 
is approximately 8-fold less potent than macitentan on ETA and 2-fold less potent on ET B. Similar 
to macitentan, the free therapeutic plasma concentrations of ACT-132577 (7.4 nM) is lower than 
the IC50 and Kb values  for the ETB (IC50 total=987 nM, Kb total=319 nM, IC 50 free=94 nM, Kb 
free=139  nM).  Based  on  the  high  exposure,  and  prolonged  half-life  this  metabolite  most  likely 
contributes to the in vivo efficacy of macitentan treatment. 
The  dependence  of  a  hemodynamic  effect  following  macitentan  treatment  on  activation  of  the 
ET-system  as  seen  in  rat  models  of  hypertension  is  also  seen  in  humans.  Also  in  humans,  the 
clinical  efficacy  of  macitentan  is  dependent  on  local  ET  system  activation  as  10  mg 
macitentan/day  decreases  blood  pressure  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension  but  not  in 
healthy subjects.  
In  dogs,  macitentan  treatment  did  result  in  reduction  in  systemic  blood  pressure  (see  safety 
pharmacology).  It  thus  appears  that  dogs  are  more  sensitive  than  humans,  and  rats  may  be  a 
better predictive model for effects of macitentan on blood pressure. 
Repeated oral administration of macitentan was not associated with tachyphylaxis and cessation 
of  treatment  did  not  result  in  a  rebound  effect.  Macitentan  was  able  to  further  decrease  blood 
pressure  when  given  on  top  of  the  other  ET  receptor  antagonists  (bosentan  or  ambrisentan). 
Conversely,  these  compounds  were  not  able  to  cause  additional  blood  pressure  reduction  when 
given on top of macitentan.  
In animal models of pulmonary hypertension (monocrotaline-induced and the bleomycin-induced 
rat  models)  macitentan  reduced  pulmonary  arterial  pressure,  pulmonary  arterial  wall  thickness, 
right  ventricular  hypertrophy  and  increased  survival.  The  first  clear  effect  on mean  (5  minutes) 
pulmonary  artery  pressure  (mPAP)  was  generally  seen  at  a  dose  of  1  mg/kg  and  the  (almost) 
maximal  effect  at  10  mg/kg,  which  is  similar  to  the  effective  doses  found  in  the  systemic 
Assessment report

Page 20/105 
 
  
  
hypertension rat models. A further increase in dose did not result in significant additional effect, 
only in the duration of the effect. In none of the in vivo studies heart rate was affected. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Only one secondary pharmacodynamics study was provided showing that macitentan did not bind 
to a panel of 63 receptors and enzymes. No  unexpected risks have been identified in animal or 
clinical  studies.  Therefore  further  non-clinical  studies  on  additional  pharmacological  targets  are 
not deemed necessary. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Potential  safety  pharmacology  effects  were  evaluated  on  central  nervous  system,  respiratory 
function and the cardiovascular system. 
The only observation was a decrease in arterial blood pressure in dogs at all tested doses. This 
effect was not observed in healthy rats, but more importantly also not in humans. 
Combined treatment of macitentan with a PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil or tadalafil) induced additive 
effects  on  maximal  blood  pressure  reduction  and  synergistic  effects  on  the  extent  and  duration 
(ABC) of mean arterial pressure reduction in hypertensive rats. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  and  metabolic  profiles  of  macitentan  have  been  characterized  in  rats  and 
dogs.  
The  analytical  method  to measure  the  plasma  concentrations  of  macitentan  and  its  metabolites 
ACT-132577 (M6, active) and ACT-373898 (M5, inactive), independently or in combination, were 
validated using LC-MS/MS. Stability of macitentan and ACT-132577 in plasma was demonstrated 
for at least 1 year and stability of ACT-373898 was demonstrated for up to 2 years.  
In  vitro  data  showed  that  macitentan  permeates  rapidly  through  membranes  and  is  not  a 
substrate  of  human  P-gp.  Macitentan  was  absorbed slowly  after  oral  dosing  in  the  rat,  whereas 
peak plasma concentrations were reached 2 h post-dose in dog.  
Oral bioavailability was about 80% in the dog and about 30% in the rat, which increased to 89% 
at  higher  doses.  After  IV  administration,  macitentan  showed  a  low  plasma  clearance  in  rat  and 
dog.  The  volume of  distribution  was  1-2  L/kg  in  rats  and  about  1  L/kg in  dogs,  which  indicates 
reasonable  distribution  into  tissues.  Exposure  to  macitentan  increased  dose-proportionally 
following IV administration in rat and dog and after oral administration in dog. 
Following oral administration in rat, exposure increased more than proportionally between 1 and 
30 mg/kg. This non-proportional behaviour may be caused by saturation of metabolic clearance. 
Non-linearity was not observed in humans and therefore this finding seems of limited relevance.  
Particle  size  had  a  significant  effect  on  macitentan  exposure  indicating  drug  dissolution  in  the 
gastrointestinal tract as a limiting factor for oral absorption. Macitentan has an active circulating 
metabolite, ACT-132577, which has comparable pharmacokinetic properties as macitentan. Only 
systemic  plasma  clearance  was  lower  than  macitentan,  resulting  in  a  longer  half-life.  Following 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 21/105 
 
  
  
 
repeated doses, the exposure to macitentan and the metabolite ACT-132577 increased less than 
dose-proportionally in mice, rats and dogs. There was no plasma accumulation of macitentan or 
ACT-132577 observed. In contrast, a decrease in the systemic exposure of macitentan and ACT-
132577  was  observed  in  rat  and  dog.  This  effect  can  be  explained  by  auto-induction  of 
macitentan  metabolism  in  rat  and  dog,  while  auto-induction  in  mouse  was  not  exhibited.  Auto-
induction is not expected in humans. 
Binding  to  plasma  proteins  is  high  in  all  species  examined  for  macitentan  (>99%),  and  for  the 
metabolites  ACT-132577  (98.3-99.9%)  and  ACT-373898  (91.0-98.5%).  Partitioning  of  either 
macitentan  or  ACT-132577  into  red  blood  cells  was  limited  in  any  of  the  species  investigated. 
Drug-related  radioactivity  distributed  into  most  tissues  within  2  hours  after  oral  administration. 
Highest  tissue  concentrations  were  measured  in  liver,  kidney,  plasma,  blood  and  lung. 
Macitentan-related  radioactivity  also  distributed  into  the  brain,  although  to  a  limited  extent 
(tissue-plasma  ratio:  0.02-0.06).  After  7  days,  drug-related  radioactivity  was  still  observed  in 
half  of  the  tissues  examined,  suggesting  some  accumulation  in  these  organs  when  using 
macitentan daily.  
Extensive  in  vitro  metabolism  was  observed  resulting  in  one  major  metabolite  ACT-132577 
retaining pharmacological activity. No human specific metabolites were observed in vitro. In both 
the pre-clinical species (rat and dog) and humans macitentan is extensively metabolised before 
excretion. The applicant investigated the biotransformation pattern in plasma, urine, and faeces 
of  rat,  dog  and  humans  and  in  bile  of  rat  and  dog.  Data  from  the  excreta  indicate  that  the 
biotransformation  pattern  could  be  different  between  the  non-clinical  species  and  humans. 
However, as macitentan and its two circulating metabolites ACT-132577 and ACT-373898  were 
present  in  rat  and  dog  in  comparable  or  higher  absolute  amounts  than  in  humans,  they  are 
adequately covered in the animal toxicity programme. 
The predominant route of elimination of drug-related radioactivity was via feces in rats and dogs 
(67-81%) independent of the route of administration. The recovery of the majority of the dose in 
feces  suggests  biliary  elimination  as  the  major  route  of  excretion.  [14C]Macitentan-derived 
material  was  excreted  in  milk  of  rats.  Concentrations  of  radioactivity  in  milk  were  below  the 
plasma  concentrations  until  48  hours  post-dose.  However,  96  hours  post-dose  the  milk-plasma 
ratio was 2.0.  
The interactions of macitentan and its major human metabolite ACT-132577 with a panel of drug 
transporters  (P-gp,  OATPB1,  OATPB3,  OCT1,  OCT2,  OAT1,  OAT3,  BSEP,  NCTP,  MATE-1  and 
MATE-2)  have  been  studied  in  order  to  investigate  potential  drug-drug  interactions.  Macitentan 
(but  not  ACT-132577)  could  be  an  inhibitor  of  drug  transporter  BCRP  at  clinically  relevant 
intestinal concentrations.  
Macitentan  and  its  metabolites  ACT-080803  (M3)  and  ACT-132577  (M6)  are  not  inducers  of 
CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Macitentan has four primary metabolic pathways. Oxidative depropylation of the sulfamide yields 
the  pharmacologically  active  metabolite  ACT-132577.  This  reaction  is  dependent  on  the 
cytochrome  P450  system,  mainly  CYP3A4  (approximately  99%)  with  minor  contributions  of 
CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  and  CYP2C19.  Other  metabolic  pathways  yield  products  without 
pharmacological  activity.  Several  members  of  the  CYP2C  family,  namely  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  and 
CYP2C19, as well as CYP3A4, are involved in the formation of these metabolites.

Potentially  drugs  that  are  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  could  have  an  effect  on  the  metabolism  of 
macitentan  and  thus  could  lead  to  drug-drug  interactions.  Multiple  clinical  studies  were 
performed  regarding  potential  drug-drug  interactions  with  other  drugs  (warfarin,  sildenafil, 
ketoconazole, rifampicin, and cyclosporin).  (see clinical section). 
No clinically relevant interactions were observed for macitentan and its active metabolite M6 with 
drugs  that  are  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4.  However,  concomitant  treatment  with  rifampicin,  a  potent 
inducer of CYP3A4, reduced the steady-state exposure to macitentan by 79% but did not affect 
the exposure to the active metabolite. Reduced efficacy of macitentan in the presence of a potent 
inducer of CYP3A4 such as rifampicin should be considered. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Mice  and  rats  were  used  for  the  single  dose  toxicity  studies  and  mice,  rats  and  dogs  for  the 
repeated-dose toxicity studies.  Rats and rabbits were used for the reproductive toxicity studies, 
and  rats  and  mice  for  the  carcinogenicity  studies.  In  mice,  rats  and  rabbits,  macitentan  was 
administered  orally  by  gavage  whereas  dogs  received  drug-containing  capsules.  Impurities  and 
metabolites  were  toxicologically  qualified  in  these  studies  and  in  the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
genotoxicity studies. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single doses of up to 2000 mg/kg by oral gavage in mouse and rat indicate that macitentan has 
low  potential  for  acute  toxicity.  Mice  showed  transient  overt  symptoms  including  ptosis  and/or 
slightly  subdued  behaviour  during  the  first  hour  after  administration,  whereas  rats  showed  no 
remarkable findings.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with  macitentan  were  performed  by  oral  administration  for  time 
intervals  up  to  13  weeks  in  mice,  26  weeks  in  rats,  and  up  to  39  weeks  in  dogs.  The 
pharmacodynamic target and the major pathways of macitentan metabolism in humans were all 
represented  in  these  species.  Thus  the  choice  of  mice,  rats,  and  dogs  was  appropriate  for  the 
toxicity  evaluation  of  macitentan.  In  addition,  a  two-week  study  was  performed  in  rabbits  to 
establish suitable dosages for the pilot embryo-fetal toxicity studies in this species. 
Safety margins or exposure margins were calculated based on combined exposure to macitentan 
and  the  pharmacologically  active  metabolite  ACT-132577  in  males  and  females.  Male  rats  were 
less exposed to the drug after treatment with the same doses than females. 
Macitentan  was  well  tolerated  from  chronic  treatment  up  to  relatively  high  dose  levels.  Drug-
related mortality was observed in the 13-week toxicity study in male Wistar rats after 2 weeks of 
treatment at 1500 mg/kg/day. Prolonged clotting times led to excessive bleeding and mortality.  
In the 4-week dog toxicity study at 500 mg/kg/day, one dog died due to drug-related anorexia. 
The mortality rate increased in the carcinogenicity studies at 400 mg/kg/day in female mice and 
at 250 mg/kg/day in female rats after approximately 1 year of treatment. A cause of death could 
not be established.

Overt  symptoms  were  limited  to  the  high  doses  and  included  occasional  breathing  difficulties, 
piloerection, coldness, unsteady gait and subdued behaviour in mice, hunched posture, prostrate 
position,  laboured  respiration,  coldness  of  limbs;  haemorrhages  in  rats,  and  decreased  food 
consumption,  reduced  activity;  subdued  behaviour;  and  a  rise  in  body  temperature  in  dogs.  In 
rabbits,  there  was  a  severe  reduction  in  body  weight  and  food  consumption  and  a  concomitant 
treatment-related morbidity, but the low dose of 25 mg/kg/day was well tolerated. 
In  the  mouse,  rat,  and  dog  toxicity  studies,  the  heart,  liver,  and  testes  were  identified  as  the 
main organs affected by treatment with macitentan. Minor or secondary changes were observed 
in RBC, the haemostatic system, thyroid, kidney, uterus, ovary and nasal cavity.  
Arterial  intimal  thickening  characterized  by  proliferation  of  the  intimal  layer  was  found  in  dogs 
treated with macitentan at doses ≥30 mg/kg/day, independently of the treatment duration. The 
right  and,  less  often,  the  left  coronary  arteries  were  the  preferred  target.  These  findings  were 
often  associated  with  breaks  of  the  internal  elastic  lamina.  After  subacute  (4-week)  treatment 
with  doses  higher  than  50  mg/kg/day,  atrial  fibrosis  with  chronic  inflammation,  epicarditis,  and 
neovascularization were also observed. Thus, the cardiac NOEL was established at 5 mg/kg/day 
in all three studies, providing an acceptable safety margin (>5.8) to maximal human exposure at 
10 mg/day.  
Public literature suggests that the observed coronary arteriopathy is a class effect of endothelin 
receptor  antagonists  in  dogs.  In  vivo  studies  described  in  the  pharmacology  section  show  that 
macitentan  decreases  arterial  blood  pressure  in  dogs  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  As  result  of 
exaggerated  pharmacology  on  ETA  receptors  (inhibition  of  vasoconstriction),  marked 
hypotension,  sustained  vasodilatation  in  the  coronary  vascular  bed  and  reflex  tachycardia  may 
alter  flow  dynamics  and  lead  to  increased  shear  stress  and  tension  on  the  coronary  wall  with 
subsequent microscopic trauma. Although the effect of macitentan on the heart rate is limited in 
dogs, provided literature suggests that the dog is a species particularly sensitive to hemodynamic 
changes and related coronary vascular and myocardial effects. Coronary and  myocardial lesions 
were  not  observed  in  rats  or  mice.  Clinically,  data  regarding  MACE  and  ECG  do  not  raise  any 
concerns regarding the long term cardiovascular safety of macitentan. 
The effects on the liver included increased weight and centrilobular hypertrophy. These findings 
are considered to be an adaptation to the increased metabolic demand and enzyme induction by 
macitentan. The increased incidence of hepatodiaphragmatic herniation observed only after 104 
weeks  of  treatment  in  rats  was  considered  to  be  related  to  the  induced  life-long  liver 
hypertrophy. 
In  mice,  focal  hepatocellular  necrosis  and  increased  plasma  levels  of  the  liver  enzymes  (AST, 
ALT) were observed in dose-range finding studies of 2- and 13-weeks' duration performed for the 
mouse carcinogenicity study. These findings were associated with bile duct proliferation and gall 
bladder  hyperplasia,  accumulation  of  pigmented  macrophages  and  granulocytic  infiltration.  The 
necrotic  foci  and  the  associated  inflammatory  reaction  in  the  liver  were  in  some  cases 
accompanied  by  increased  polymorphonuclear  leukocyte  counts  in  lymph  nodes  and  increased 
granulopoiesis in the bone marrow.  
A  dose-range  finding  study  in  B6C3F1-mice  revealed  that  CD-1  are  more  susceptible  to 
hepatocellular necrosis than B6C3F1 mice.

The slightly decreased concentrations of albumin, cholesterol, bilirubin and/or urea and increased 
concentrations of triglyceride in plasma further point to a slightly decreased liver function.  
In  vitro  cytotoxicity  studies  in  mouse  and  human  liver  slices  did  not  measure  mitochondrial 
toxicity  and  only  found  cytotoxicity  at  concentrations  far  above  the  in  vivo  concentration  at 
clinical  therapeutic  dose  in  humans.  Thus,  the  liver  toxicity  found  in  the  repeated  dose  studies 
can  be  explained  by  indirect  mechanisms  and  therefore  does  not  provide  specific  evidence  for 
mitochondrial toxicity.  
Bosentan but not ambrisentan inhibited human hepatic transporters, which have been discussed 
as  a  potential  mechanism  for  the  increased  hepatotoxicity  observed  for  this  agent  in  humans. 
However, macitentan and metabolite M6 are not expected to interfere with hepatic and bile salt 
transport.  
Drug-related  effects  on  the  male  reproductive  system  were  identified  in  rats  and  dogs.  The 
alterations 
found 
included  dilation  of  seminiferous  tubules,  tubular  degeneration  and 
hypospermatogenesis.  The  NOAELs  for  dilation  of  seminiferous  tubules  in  rats  were  50 
mg/kg/day (8.2 fold the exposure in patients treated with 10 mg/day of macitentan) in the 13-
week toxicity study, 250 mg/kg/day (11.6 fold the exposure in patients treated with 10 mg/day 
of macitentan) in 26-week rat toxicity studies and it was not determined, but it is lower than 10 
mg/kg/day (4.2 fold the exposure in patients treated with 10 mg/day of macitentan) in the 104-
weeks  carcinogenicity  study.  These  findings  suggest  that  the  testicular  risk  increases  after 
chronic treatment. In the 39-week dog toxicity study, the NOEL was established at 5 mg/kg/day 
(5.8 fold the exposure in patients treated with 10 mg/day of macitentan). Seminology showed an 
increased percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm at 50 and 250 mg/kg/day, only in the 
26-week rat study (NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day, 2.3 fold the exposure in patients). It is difficult to 
assess  the  clinical  relevance  of  hypospermatogenesis  and  tubular  degeneration  because 
individual  cases  have  been  reported  in  different  rats  and  dogs  studies,  including  animals  from 
control  groups.  The  chronic  treatment  also  induced  an  increase  in  the  prostate  weight  at  250 
mg/kg/day (NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day, 8.2 fold the exposure in patients treated with 10 mg/day 
of  macitentan)  in  rats.  Adverse  effects  induced  by  macitentan  in  rat  male  reproductive  organs 
were reversible.  
Haematological alterations as decreased haematocrit, RBC count and haemoglobin and increased 
WBC and platelet were observed in different mice, rat and dog toxicity studies. The changes were 
minimal, found at doses that indicate acceptable safety margins for humans (8.2 in rats, 5.8 in 
male dogs and 17 in female dogs) and reversible. 
A prolonged aPTT was observed in male rats treated with 250 mg/kg/day during 13 or 26 weeks. 
The  finding  is  considered  to  have  limited  relevance  to  humans  as  it  was  observed  only  at  high 
dose levels that provide safety margins higher than 7, in only one species and only in males. 
The observed increased thyroid weight, possibly a reflection of follicular cell hypertrophy, seems 
to be a secondary effect of drug-metabolizing enzyme induction in the liver. A similar effect has 
also been reported with bosentan, which is also an inducer of P450 enzymes.. A benign follicular 
cell adenoma was recorded for the thyroid of one male rat and a cystic follicular hyperplasia for 
one female rat treated with high doses of macitentan. Although both these findings can be seen 
as  a  spontaneous  background  change,  an  association  with  the  treatment-related  follicular  cell 
hypertrophy  cannot  be  excluded.  A  treatment-related  altered  thyroid  function  (mild  thyroid 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 25/105 
 
  
  
hormone imbalance in male rats) has been reported for bosentan, but not for ambrisentan. Thus 
far, there is no evidence of bosentan affecting thyroid function (thyroxin, TSH) in humans. 
The  kidney  was  also  affected  by  macitentan  in  Wistar  rats.  Treatment  longer  than  13  weeks  at 
≥50  mg/kg/day  induced  an  increase  in  male  kidney  weights  Treatment  during  26  weeks 
increased the incidence of hyaline/pigment droplets in males at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day and in females 
at  250  mg/kg/day.  The  alterations  were  reversible  and  the  NOEL  for  kidney  damage  was 
established  at  10  mg/kg/day  (2.3  fold  the  exposure  in  patients  treated  with  10  mg/day  of 
macitentan). 
An  increased  incidence  of  endometrial  cysts  in  the  uterus,  associated  with  increased  uterus 
weights, was observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study at ≥100 mg/kg/day providing a safety 
margin of 46, and in the rat carcinogenicity study at all doses tested. However, uterine cysts in 
senescent rats are considered of limited clinical relevance because the mechanism leading to this 
finding may be due to specific rat hormonal changes induced by macitentan.  
Additionally, angiomatous change in the rat ovaries was found at the highest dose (250/50 
mg/kg/day) tested. The NOAEL for the ovary effects was established at 50/25 mg/kg/day, 13.4 
fold the exposure level in humans treated with 10 mg of macitentan. 
Finally,  proliferation  of  nasal  mucosa  and  increased  incidence  of  inflammatory  infiltration  were 
seen  in  nasal  cavities  in  mouse  carcinogenicity  study  at  all  dose  levels.  Hyaline  inclusions  and 
increased  secretion  were  found  at  doses  ≥  30  mg/kg/day.  Similar  effects  on  the  nasal  cavity 
have also been observed in animals treated other ERAs. However, nonclinical data macitentan do 
not indicate a higher risk with macitentan than with ambrisentan, bosentan or sitaxentan, based 
on the number of affected species, the time of onset and severity of nasal cavity findings. 
Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  macitentan  was  evaluated  using  a  conventional  battery  of  tests: 
genetic  mutation  in  bacteria  and  in  L5178Y  mouse  lymphoma  cells,  chromosomal  aberration  in 
human  lymphocytes  and  rat  micronucleus  in  vivo.  All  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  tests  were  performed 
according to the ICH requirements (CHMP/ICH/126642/08. Guidance on Genotoxicity Testing and 
Data  Interpretation  for  Pharmaceuticals  intended  for  Human  use  (ICH  S  2  (R1))  and  resulted 
negative. Thus, it can be concluded that macitentan is not genotoxic. 
The  metabolite  of  macitentan  ACT-373898  (M5)  and  the  impurity  ACT-080803  (degradation 
product in the active substance) are not mutagenic.  
Carcinogenicity 
No oncogenic potential was evident in mice or rats after 104 weeks of treatment with macitentan 
at doses that provide a safety margin for carcinogenicity ≥ 20. 
The combination of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies allowed evaluating all states 
advised in the ICH S5 guideline.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The  NOEL  for  male  and  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  in  rats  was  250 
mg/kg/day.  However,  the  observed  effects  of  macitentan  on  testes  (tubular  dilatation,  tubular 
atrophy  and  hypospermatogenesis)  during  long-term  treatment  could  affect  the  reproduction. 
Testes  were  also  target  organs  of  macitentan  in  the  offspring  (F1)  of  females  treated  during 
pregnancy  and  lactation  and  in  juvenile  treated  animals.  In  both  studies,  the  fertility  was  also 
affected. Additionally, testicular toxicity has not been adequately assessed in clinical trials. Thus, 
effects of macitentan on male human fertility cannot be excluded.  
Macitentan showed clear dose-dependent teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. In both species 
there  were  cardiovascular  and  mandibular  arch  fusion  abnormalities.  The  observed  effects  are 
class  effects  of  ET  receptor  antagonists.  A  NOEL  for  embryo-fetal  development  was  not 
established. In line with other ERAs, a pregnancy contraindication is included in the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rats  have  shown  that  macitentan  is  excreted  into  milk.  Therefore,  
macitentan, like other ERAs, is also contraindicated during breast-feeding. 
Other toxicity studies 
The juvenile toxicity study did not show new target organ toxicity as compared to adult animals 
but  juvenile  animals  are more  sensitive  to  macitentan  than  adults.  Effects  on  development  and 
on reproductive variables were found at doses that suppose an exposure level 6.7 and 3.8 fold, 
respectively,  the  levels  reached  in  humans  treated  with  10  mg/day  of  macitentan.  Risk  for 
human development and reproduction cannot be discarded.  
All  impurities  which  were  present  in  former  batches  and  the  proposed  specification  of  future 
batches of macitentan are regarded as appropriately qualified. 
In  an  in  vitro  system  using  Balb/c  3T3  fibroblast  cell  cultures,  macitentan  exhibited  weak 
phototoxicity  at  high  concentrations.  An  in  vivo  study  in  hairless  rats  showed  no  phototoxic 
effects up to the high dose level of 60 mg/kg/day corresponding 24-fold the human exposure at 
10  mg  per  day.  It  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  no  relevant  risk  of  phototoxicity  for  patients 
treated with macitentan at 10 mg per day. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted information related to the environmental risk assessment. After review of the 
data,  the  CHMP  considered  the  need  to  perform  Log  Know  determination  using  a  different 
method.  
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on 
the potential risk of macitentan to the environment.  
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAH  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation:  
Assessment report

The  applicant  has  agreed  with  the  recommendation  to  perform  a  log  Kow  determination  for 
macitentan, according to the slow stirring method (OECD 123). 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Macitentan  has  been  developed  as  an  oral  therapy  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH). Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive 
disease  of  the  small  pulmonary  arteries  that  is  characterised  by  vascular  proliferation  and 
remodelling. It results in increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance 
and, ultimately, right ventricular heart failure and death. Although the pathogenesis of PAH is not 
completely  understood,  it  likely  involves  an  imbalance  in  the  normal  relationships  between 
vasodilators  and  vasoconstrictors,  growth  inhibitors  and  mitogenic  factors,  and  antithrombotic 
and  prothrombotic  determinants  that  are  probably  consequences  of  pulmonary  endothelial  cell 
dysfunction and/or injury.   
Macitentan  is  able  to  block  the  binding  of  ET-1  to  ETA  and  ETB  receptor.  Although  the 
pathophysiology  of  PAH  is  not  fully  understood,  ET-1  and  its  receptors  ETA  and  ETB  are  up-
regulated  in  PAH,  are  considered  mediators  of  the  pathological  changes  leading  to  the  disease 
and  are  targets  for  currently  available  PAH-specific  therapies.  Therefore,  the  development  of 
Opsumit in the treatment of PAH is justified from a mechanistic perspective. 
The pharmacological studies provided by the applicant support that macitentan is an inhibitor of 
ETA  and  ETB  receptors  and  it  inhibits  the  effects  mediated  by  these  receptors,  as  intracellular 
accumulation  of  Ca  and  IP 1  and  induced  contraction  of  isolated tissues  (rat  aorta  and  trachea). 
However,  the  free  therapeutic  plasma  concentrations  of  macitentan  (2.5  nM)  and  ACT-132577 
(M6) (7.4 nM) are lower than the IC50 and Kb values for the ETB receptor. Thus, based on in vitro 
data  macitentan  can  be  regarded  as  an  ERA  that  is  approximately  100-fold  more  selective  for 
ETA  as  compared  to  ETB.  On  the  other  hand,  plasma  ET-1  concentration,  a  marker  of  ETB 
blockade, was increased in animals and humans after treatment with macitentan, indicating that 
ETB receptor is inhibited by macitentan in vivo. 
Efficacy of macitentan was demonstrated in animal models of systemic hypertension, pulmonary 
hypertension  and  pulmonary  fibrosis.  Comparative  efficacy  studies  have  shown that  macitentan 
could  provide  a  therapeutic  advantage  over  the  currently  available  therapies  bosentan  and 
ambrisentan.  
The metabolite ACT-132577 is also active. It is approximately 8-fold less potent than macitentan 
on ETA and 2-fold less potent on ETB, and it may contribute to the overall pharmacological effect 
of macitentan in vivo.  
Safety pharmacology studies did not revealed any adverse neurobehavioral or respiratory effects. 
Arterial  intimal  thickening  characterized  by  proliferation  of  the  intimal  layer  was  found  in  dogs 
treated  with  macitentan  at  doses  ≥30  mg/kg/day,  independently  of  the  treatment  duration.  In 
vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  show  that  macitentan  decreases  arterial  blood  pressure  in  dogs  in  a 
dose-dependent  manner.  The  effect  of  macitentan  on  blood  pressure  is  limited  to  dogs,  and 
provided  literature  suggests  that  the  dog  is  a  species  particularly  sensitive  to  hemodynamic 
changes and related coronary vascular and myocardial effects. Coronary and  myocardial lesions 
Assessment report

were  not  observed  in  rats  or  mice.  Clinically,  data  regarding  MACE  and  ECG  do  not  raise  any 
concerns regarding the long term cardiovascular safety of macitentan. 
Combined  treatment  of  macitentan  with  phosphodiesterase  5  inhibitor  (sildenafil)  increased  the 
duration  of  blood  pressure-lowering  effect  induced  by  the  monotheraphy  in  hypertensive  rats. 
Other  relevant  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  have  been  monitored  in  the  clinical  setting, 
and therefore additional non-clinical studies are not warranted. 
The  pharmacokinetic  and  metabolic  profile  of  macitentan  was  characterized  in  the  rat  and  the 
dog. 
Macitentan metabolism in rats and dogs shows large similarities to the pattern observed in man 
and all human metabolites were present in animals, supporting the relevance of these species for 
the  preclinical  safety  program  of  macitentan,  although  data  from  the  excreta  indicate  that  the 
biotransformation pattern could be different between the non-clinical species. 
The  primary  metabolism  of  macitentan  is  catalyzed  by  P450  enzymes,  mainly  by  CYP3A4  with 
contributions of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. 
The  potential  interactions  of  macitentan  and  its  major  human  metabolite  M6  with  a  panel  of 
transporter (P-gp, OATPB1, OATPB3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, BSEP, NCTP, MATE-1 and MATE-
2)  have  been  studied  in  order  to  characterize  potential  drug-drug  interactions.  Macitentan  (but 
not  ACT-132577)  could  be  an  inhibitor  of  BCRP  at  clinically  relevant  intestinal  concentrations. 
Macitentan  and  its  metabolites  ACT-080803  and  ACT-132577  are  not  inducers  of  CYP3A4  at 
clinically relevant concentrations. 
Macitentan  passed  into  the  milk  of  lactating  rats.  Therefore,  macitentan  is  contraindicated  in 
lactation. 
Macitentan was well tolerated from chronic treatment up to relatively high dose levels. 
In  the  mouse,  rat,  and  dog  toxicity  studies,  the  heart,  liver,  and  testes  were  identified  as  the 
main organs affected by treatment with macitentan. Minor or secondary changes were observed 
in RBC, the hemostatic system, thyroid, uterus, kidney and nasal cavity. The clinical relevance of 
testicular findings (tubular dilation, tubular atrophy and hypospermatogenesis) is unknown and a 
potential risk for male fertility cannot be discarded based on these animal studies.  
There were no evidences of genotoxic and carcinogenic potential associated with macitentan.  
Macitentan showed clear dose-dependent teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. In both species 
there were cardiovascular and mandibular arch fusion abnormalities. The observed effects are to 
be class effect of ET receptor antagonists. In line with other ERAs, a pregnancy contraindication 
is included in the SmPC. 
The juvenile toxicity study did not show new target organ toxicity as compared to adult animals 
but  juvenile  animals  are  more  sensitive  to  macitentan  than  adults.  The  SmPC  in  section  5.3 
provides adequate information related to the juvenile toxicity findings. 
The MAH submitted information related to the environmental risk assessment. After review of the 
data, the CHMP considered the need to perform Log Kow determination using a different method.  
Assessment report

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on 
the potential risk of macitentan to the environment.  
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAH  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation:  
The  applicant  has  accepted  the  recommendation  to  perform  a  log  Kow  determination  for 
macitentan, according to the slow stirring method (OECD 123). 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view,  Opsumit  would  be  recommended  for  approval.  The  SmPC 
appropriately reflects the non clinical data submitted with macitentan.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

Macitentan  has  been  studied  in  an  adequate  program  of  pharmacology  studies,  which  provide 
comprehensive  information  on  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  metabolism,  effects  of  intrinsic  factors 
and  concomitant  use  of  other  drugs,  and  important  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  characteristics.  A 
total  of  14  completed  clinical  pharmacology  studies  are  included  in  the  application.  A brief 
summary is provided in Table O-PK-01. Additional relevant PK/PD information that is discussed in 
this  section  was  generated  in  study  AC-055-201  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension  (Study 
AC-055-201)  and  in  a  PK/PD  sub-studies  to  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study  AC-055-302  SERAPHIN 
(study AC-055-302) and its open-label extension AC-055-303 SERAPHIN OL.  
Two  formulations  of  macitentan  were  used  in  clinical  studies,  a  capsule  formulation  for  early 
clinical development and a film-coated tablet formulation, which was used in a number of Phase 
1 studies, in the Phase 2 study in IPF, and in the pivotal Phase 3 study in PAH. The film-coated 
tablet  formulation  used  in  the  confirmatory  clinical  study  (SERAPHIN)  is  identical  to  the  to-be-
marketed formulation. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Macitentan has been studied in a total of 14 completed clinical pharmacology studies. Additional 
relevant  PK/PD  information  was  generated  in  study  AC-055-201  in  patients  with  essential 
hypertension and in a PK/PD sub-studies of the pivotal Phase 3 study AC-055-302 SERAPHIN and 
its open-label extension AC-055-303 SERAPHIN OL . 
Concentrations  of  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  ACT-132577  in  human  plasma  were 
determined  using  liquid  chromatography  coupled  to  tandem  mass  spectrometry  method  (LC-
MS/MS).  All  analyses  were  performed  in  the  same  laboratory  and  during  the  studies  a  partial 
validation  was  performed,  mainly  by  analysing  quality  samples.  In  the  studies  after  2009 
incurred  samples  analysis  was  performed.  The  studied  PK  parameters  (Cmax,  t max,  t1/2,  AUC0-t, 
and AUC0-∞) as well as statistical methods are the usual ones in PK studies and are considered 
appropriate.

Bioequivalence between tablets and capsules (study AC-055-108) 
The MAH performed an open label two-way cross-over tablet–capsule biocomparison study (AC-
055-108)  aiming  at  comparing  the  film-coated  tablets  (intended  to-be-marketed  formulation) 
and  capsule  formulations  (used  in  early  clinical  development  and  the  Phase  II  study  in 
hypertension) in 12 healthy subjects.  
Maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  the 
film-coated  tablets  (intended  to-be-marketed 
formulation, used in a number of Phase 1 studies, in the Phase 2 study in IPF, and in the pivotal 
Phase 3 SERAPHIN study in PAH) were slightly lower (19%)  than capsules (used in early clinical 
development and the Phase II study in hypertension). However, the relative difference in AUC is 
small  (ranging  between  5%  to7%),  and  the  corresponding  90%  CI  for  AUC  falls  within 
bioequivalence  limits.  Therefore,  results  of  PK  studies  conducted  with  capsules  may  be 
extrapolated to tablets. 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of macitentan could not be established, as the development of an i.v. 
formulation  was  not  technically  feasible.  Maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  macitentan  are 
achieved  about  8 hours  after  oral  administration.  Thereafter,  plasma  concentrations  of 
macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  decrease  slowly,  with  apparent  elimination  half-lives  of 
approximately 16 hours and 48 hours, respectively (Table O-PK-02 and Figure O-PK-01).

of a single macitentan dose of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300, or 600 mg 
Influence of food (study AC-055-103) 
In healthy subjects, the exposure to macitentan and its active metabolite was unchanged in the 
presence  of  food  and,  therefore,  macitentan  is  proposed  to  be  taken  with  or  without  food.  The 
breakfast  that  was  provided  followed  the  FDA  guidance  for  Food-Effect  Bioavailability  and  Fed 
Bioequivalence Studies.  
Distribution 
Macitentan and ACT-132577 are well distributed into tissues as indicated by an apparent volume 
of  distribution  (Vss/F)  of  approximately  50  L  and  40  L  for  macitentan  and  ACT-132577, 
respectively  (Study  AD-055-101).  Macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  are  highly  bound  to 
plasma proteins (>99%), primarily to albumin (Study B-04.025). 
Metabolism  
Macitentan  undergoes  biotransformation  by  hydroxylation,  with  the  CYP3A4  isoenzyme  as  the 
major  contributor  (Studies  B-04.022,  B-04.093  and  B-04.099).  Two  circulating  macitentan 
metabolites  have  been  identified  in  humans:  ACT-132577  (active  metabolite)  and  ACT-373898 
(inactive  metabolite).  ACT-132577  is  approximately  8-fold  less  potent  than  macitentan  on  ET A 
and  2-fold  less  potent  on  ET B.  The  main  metabolite  is  ACT-132577  (active  M6),  present  at 
approximately  71%  of  total  drug  exposure  in  plasma.  No  particularly  relevant  consequences  of 
polymorphism in CYP3A4 are expected. 
Elimination 
The  major  excretion  route  of  macitentan  in  humans,  in  the  form  of  metabolites,  is  via  urine, 
accounting for about 50% of the dose (four metabolites, with the metabolite M323u as the most 
abundant one), while approximately 24% of the administered dose was recovered in faeces (five 
metabolites,  with  the  metabolite  ACT-080803  M5  the  most  abundant  one)  (study AC-055-104). 
Neither unchanged macitentan nor the active metabolite ACT-132577 were recovered in urine.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
After  repeated  administration,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  macitentan  are  dose-proportional  up  to 
and  including  30 mg  (study  AC-055-102).  In  healthy  subjects,  the  accumulation  factor  for 
macitentan  was  1.4–1.7  when  comparing  the  AUC0-24  on  Days  1  and  10.  The  expected 
accumulation of the active metabolite ACT-132577 based on the half-life was approximately 3.5. 
However, the accumulation found in healthy subjects after repeated dosing was relatively large, 
7-10 times (study AC-055-102). The applicant has clarified that the differences in accumulation 
ratio  of  the  metabolite  ACT132577  based  on  half-life  and  the  accumulation  found  in  vivo  after 
repeated  dosing  are  due  to  differences  in  equations  applied.  In  patients,  no  trend  for  time-
dependency was noted (study AC-055-302). Inter-subject variability was low in healthy subjects 
and moderate in patients.  
PK in the target population 
Based  on  trough  concentrations,  exposure  to  macitentan  in  patients  with  PAH  (study  AC-055-
302) was approximately 2-fold greater than in healthy subjects ((study AC-055-102) or patients 
with  essential  hypertension  (Table  O-PK-03).  ACT-132577  trough  plasma  concentrations  were 
higher  in  patients  with  PAH  and  essential  hypertension  (Study  AC-055-201)  when  compared  to 
healthy subjects treated with 10 mg macitentan (study AC-055-102).

A  PK  sub-study  within  study  AC-055-303  (SERAPHIN-OL),  the  open-label  extension  to  the 
SERAPHIN  study,  was  undertaken  to  allow  a  more  precise  dose  selection  for  clinical  trials  in 
children and was recently clinically completed. For this, 20 patients from the SERAPHIN-OL study 
were  confined  to  the  clinic  for  24  hours,  during  which  samples  for  a  PK  profile  evaluation  were 
taken,  thus  allowing  for  determination  of  Cmax  and  AUCτ  of  macitentan  and  ACT-132577.  The 
findings  indicated  that  plasma  exposure  to  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  ACT-132577, 
measured  over  a  24  h  dosing  interval,  were  increased  by  approximately  10–30%  between  PAH 
patients and healthy subjects. These findings are reflected in the SmPC. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment (Study AC-055-112) 
The  relative  increase  in  exposure  to  macitentan  and  the  active  metabolite  observed  in  patients 
with severely impaired renal function (24% and 58% higher than those in healthy subjects) was 
below that achieved at the highest well-tolerated macitentan dose of 300 mg reported in the SAD 
study  (AC-055-101).  There  was  an  8-fold  increase  in  the  exposure  to  the  inactive  metabolite 
ACT-373898,  which  is  expected  not  to  be  of  clinical  relevance,  based  on  available  data  in 
animals.  However,  the  clinical  significance  in  humans  is  unknown.  In  addition,  no  data  are 
available in PAH patients with severe renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment (Study AC-055-110) 
Overall,  the  exposure  to  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  is  decreased  by  20%  in  patients 
with  hepatic  impairment,  without  differences  according  to  the  degree  of  impairment.  The 
differences  in  other  PK  parameters  between  hepatically  impaired  and  normal  subjects  are  even 
more irrelevant. Therefore, no dose-adjustment in hepatic impairment is deemed necessary. It is 
possible  that  the  PK  of  a  drug  differs  between  a  hepatically  impaired  subject  population  and  a 
healthy  population  treated  concomitantly  with  a  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor.  On  the  basis  of  the 
hepatic  impairment  study  AC-055-110,  the  applicant  hypothesises  that  the  decrease  in  intrinsic 
hepatic  clearance  due  to  a  decrease  in  enzyme-capacity  is  compensated  by  the  increase  in  the 
unbound fraction leading to an unchanged hepatic drug clearance. 
Gender  
Females tend to have a longer t1/2 and higher plasma through concentration for both macitentan 
and  ACT-132577,  leading  to  differences  in  exposure  when  compared  to  males  (Study  AC-055-
109).  However,  the  small  difference  observed  could  be  confounded  by  body-weight  differences 
(female subjects had a body weight 12% lower than that of the male subjects). 
Race  
There  were  no  large  differences  between  the  races  involved  in  the  studies  with  this  product. 
Japanese  subjects  tend  to  have  lower  exposures  to  macitentan  and  ACT-132577  than 
Caucasians,  although  the  15%  relative  difference  seems  not  to  be  of  clinical  relevance  (Study 
AC-055-109).  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  different  races  do  not  show  clinically 
relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of macitentan.

Weight  
Analysis  by  weight  category  (<  50  kg,  50–99  kg,  and  >  100  kg)  did  not  indicate  a  clinically 
relevant  effect  of  weight  on  exposure  to  macitentan  at  Month  6  or  EOT.  A  decrease  of  trough 
plasma  concentrations  of  ACT-132577  with  weight  was  suggested  in  the  10  mg  dose  group  at 
Month  6,  but  this  observation  could  have  been  driven  by  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  a 
weight above 100 kg. 
Elderly  
The number of elderly patients included in the clinical development of macitentan is provided in 
table  below.  In  the  14  dedicated  PK  studies,  no  subjects  >  65  were  included.  The  PK  studies 
were  performed  in  a  healthy  subject  population  and  the  upper  allowed  age  limit  for  inclusion 
varied  between  45  and  65  years  of  age.  The  SmPC  reflects  that  there  is  limited  clinical 
experience  in  patients  over  the  age  of  75  years,  and  therefore  macitentan  should  be  used  with 
caution in this population (see also “PK in the target population”).

programme of macitentan 
Children: 
Twenty  patients  between  the  ages  of  12  and  <  18  years  were  enrolled  in  SERAPHIN  study. 
Characterisation  of  PK  could  not  be  performed.  Additional  data  would  be  needed  in  order  to 
support paediatric use (Refer to the clinical efficacy and safety part). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Drug-drug interactions 
in vitro studies showed that the metabolism of macitentan to its active metabolite is catalysed by 
CYP3A4  and  to  a  minor  extent  by  CYP2C19  (Studies  B-04.022,  B-04.093  and  B-04.099). 
Macitentan and its active metabolite were neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of CYP isoenzymes, 
multi-drug  resistance  protein  (P-gp,  MDR-1),  or  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptides 
(OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), and did not interact with proteins involved in hepatic bile salt transport 
(i.e.  BSEP,  NTCP).  In  vivo  DDI  studies  with  warfarin  (study  AC-055-105),  sildenafil  (study  AC-
055-106)  and  cyclosporine  (study  AC-055-111)  showed  no  relevant  PK  interaction  with 
macitentan.  In  addition,  there  was  a  2-fold  increase  in  macitentan  exposure  with  concomitant 
ketoconazole,  a  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  (Study  AC-055-107)  and  a  decrease  by  79%  in 
macitentan  exposure  with  concomitant  rifampicin,  a  potent  inducer  of  CYP3A4  (Study  AC-055-
111). However, ketoconazole was only administered once daily dose and therefore the inhibitory 
effect  is  not  considered  to  represent  a  worst-case  scenario  due  to  the  short  half-life  of 
ketoconazole  in  comparison  to  macitentan.  In  post-hoc  analyses,  the  predicted  increase  was

approximately 3.0-fold in the presence of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily using physiologically 
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. 
No  specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies  with  hormonal  contraceptives  have  been  conducted. 
However,  the 
lack  of 
interaction  with  sildenafil 
indicates  that  no  clinically  relevant 
pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  macitentan  and  other  CYP3A4  substrates  would  occur. 
Overall, macitentan seems to have a low potential for interactions with other medicinal products. 
Exposure relevant for safety information  
In  dose-ascending  studies  conducted  in  healthy  subjects  (Studies  AC-055-101  and  102),  dose-
dependent increases in the incidence of AEs  were observed, with headache the most frequently 
reported adverse event. 
The  relationship  between  exposure  (trough  plasma  concentrations)  and  safety  in  PAH  patients 
was characterized using a logistic regression model (PK/PD Modelling Report AC-055-302) based 
on  the  data  from  study  AC-055-302  (SERAPHIN).  However,  for  adverse  events,  only  the 
relationship between exposure and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was explored. Only 
a  small  number  of  patients  had  an  AE  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  (n  =  26)  in  this 
analysis.  On  the  other  hand,  there  was  an  inverse  relationship  between  macitentan  trough 
plasma concentrations and changes in hematocrit and haemoglobin levels, but no concentration-
dependent  impact  on  changes  in  liver  function  tests  could  be  established.  Post-hoc  logistic 
regression  models  were  applied  to  explore  the  relationship  between  exposure  and  treatment-
related AEs. The median macitentan trough concentrations in the 3 mg and 10 mg dose groups 
(89 and 276 ng/mL) predicted increases in the probability to have an AE of anaemia from 1.77% 
(placebo subjects) to 2.09% and 2.96%, respectively. No trend was observed for infrequent AEs 
(n<30  for  the  SMQs  teratogenicity,  thrombocytopenia,  leucopenia,  menstrual  disorder,  and 
ovarian cysts) or for hepatic events (n = 86). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Macitentan  is  an  orally  active  potent  endothelin  receptor  antagonist,  approximately  100-fold 
more selective for ETA as compared to ETB (refer to the non-clinical part). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Binding of an ERA to ETB receptors causes an increase in plasma ET-1 levels, which can be used 
as a marker of pharmacological effect and potency on the ETB receptor. This effect of ERAs is of 
rapid  onset.  A  dose-related  effect  of  macitentan  to  increase  plasma  ET-1  levels  was 
demonstrated in nonclinical in vivo studies, as well as after a single dose in humans (study AC-
055-101) (Figure O-PD-01).

Figure PD-01. Study AC-055-101: Effect of macitentan on plasma ET-1 concentrations. 
In  the  multiple-ascending  dose  study  in  healthy  subjects  (study  AC-055-102),  plasma  ET-1 
concentrations  at  steady-state  showed  a  dose-dependent  increase,  with  no  further  increase 
beyond the 10 mg OD dose (Figure O-PD-02), indicating full receptor blockade at this dose level. 
Figure  O-PD-02.  Study  AC-055-102:  Effect  of  macitentan  on  plasma  ET-1 
concentrations  
Macitentan  has  a  circulating  active  metabolite  (ACT-132577)  that  is  also  a  dual  ERA,  is  on 
average  approximately  5-fold  less  potent  than  macitentan,  and  may  contribute  to  the  clinical 
effect.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Thorough TQT study (AC-055-114)  
A Thorough QT study AC-055-114 was conducted to investigate the effect of repeated daily doses 
of  10  mg  and  30 mg  macitentan  on  the  QT/QTc  interval  in  healthy  male  and  female  subjects. 
This  was  a  double-blind,  double-dummy,  placebo-controlled,  4-way  crossover,  with  open-label 
with moxifloxacin as active comparator. 64 healthy subjects were enrolled.  
The  results  demonstrate  that  macitentan  did  not  affect  cardiac  repolarization  in  nonclinical 
studies or in a thorough TQT study.

and 90% CI over time, 30 mg macitentan. 
Testicular safety (study AC-055-113) 
The  results  of  a  dedicated  study  in  healthy  subjects,  as  well  as  evidence  from  non-clinical 
studies,  cannot  exclude  with  reasonable  confidence  the  possibility  that  macitentan  would  have 
any major effect on sperm concentration or sperm motility and morphology.  
Relationship between plasma concentrations and effect  
In the PK/PD model, increasing macitentan concentrations were associated with longer time from 
baseline to morbidity/mortality event and with an increase in 6 minute walk distance (6MWD).  
However, no clear separation between the macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg doses could be observed. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  an  event  who  provided  PK  data  at  EOT  was  small.  Thus,  the 
results  should  be  interpreted  cautiously  and  no  firm  conclusion  should  be  drawn.  Increasing 
macitentan  concentrations  were  associated  with  reductions  in  PVR,  mPAP,  and  TPR  and  an 
increase in cardiac index. However, no relationship was established for mRAP and mixed venous 
oxygen  saturation  (SvO2).  The  most  important  dose-related  AE  was  anaemia/  haemoglobin 
decrease.  
In  conclusion,  based  on  the  results  from  the  pivotal  SERAPHIN  study,  no  population/population 
subset  has  been  identified  for  which  a  dose  below  10  mg  could  be  recommended,  without  the 
risk of compromising the benefit that can be obtained with macitentan 10 mg.   
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In healthy volunteers (study AC-055-106), the administration of macitentan and sildenafil led to 
an  increase  in  headache  and  hypotension  as  compared  with  each  of  the  drugs  administered 
alone. In the double-blind PAH population, headache was reported at an incidence of 13.2% and 
13.6%  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  and  10  mg  groups,  respectively,  and  at  8.8%  in  the  placebo 
group. The incidence of headache in patients with concurrent PAH therapy was 14.0% (23/164) 
and  13.6%  (21/154)  on  macitentan  3  and  10  mg,  respectively,  versus  10.5%  (16/153)  on 
placebo.  These  data  do  not  indicate  a  higher  incidence  of  headache  associated  with  the 
administration of macitentan in patients receiving concurrent PAH therapy. Subgroup evaluation 
of  the  PT  ‘hypotension’  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population  showed  that  the  incidence  of 
hypotension  in  patients  with  concurrent  PAH  therapy  was  6.1%  (10/164)  and  4.5%  (7/154)  on 
macitentan  3  and  10  mg,  respectively,  versus  3.3%  (5/153)  on  placebo.  In  the  subgroup  not 
treated  with  a  specific  PAH  therapy,  the  incidence  of  hypotension  was  4.7%  (4/86)  and  9.1%

(8/88) in macitentan 3 and 10 mg, respectively, versus 6.3% (6/96) on placebo. These data do 
not  suggest  a  higher  incidence  of  hypotension  AEs  associated  with  the  administration  of 
macitentan in patients receiving concurrent PAH therapy.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Macitentan has been studied in a total of 14 completed clinical pharmacology studies. Additional 
relevant  PK/PD  information  was  generated  in  study  AC-055-201  in  patients  with  essential 
hypertension and in a PK/PD sub-study to the pivotal Phase 3 study AC-055-302 SERAPHIN. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Concentrations  of  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  ACT-132577  in  human  plasma  were 
determined  using  a  validated  liquid  chromatography  coupled  to  tandem  mass  spectrometry 
method  (LC-MS/MS).  The  analytical  method  was  demonstrated  to  be  precise  and  accurate.  The 
studied PK parameters (Cmax, tmax, t1/2, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞) as well as statistical methods 
are the usual ones in PK studies and are considered appropriate. It is considered that results of 
PK studies conducted with capsules (used in early clinical development and the Phase 2 study in 
hypertension) may be extrapolated to film coated tablets (intended to-be-marketed formulation, 
used  in  a  number  of  Phase  1  studies,  in  the  Phase  2  study  in  IPF,  and  in  the  pivotal  Phase  3 
SERAPHIN study in PAH). 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of macitentan could not be established, as the development of an i.v. 
formulation  was  not  technically  feasible.  Maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  macitentan  are 
achieved  about  8 hours  after  administration.  Thereafter,  plasma  concentrations  of  macitentan 
and its active metabolite decrease slowly, with an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 
16 hours  and  48 hours,  respectively.  In  healthy  subjects,  the  exposure  to  macitentan  and  its 
active  metabolite  was  unchanged  in  the  presence  of  food  and,  therefore,  macitentan  may  be 
taken with or without food. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC section 5.2.  
Distribution 
Macitentan and ACT-132577 are well distributed into tissues as indicated by an apparent volume 
of  distribution  (Vss/F)  of  approximately  50L  and  40L  for  macitentan  and  ACT-132577, 
respectively. Macitentan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%), 
primarily to albumin.  
Biotransformation/metabolism 
Macitentan undergoes biotransformation by hydroxylation, with CYP3A4 isoenzyme as the major 
contributor.  The  main  metabolite  is  ACT-132577  (active  M6),  present  at  approximately  71%  of 
total drug exposure in plasma. No particularly relevant consequences of polymorphism in CYP3A4 
are expected. In vitro studies showed that the metabolism of macitentan to its active metabolite 
is  catalysed  by  CYP3A4  and  to  a  much  minor  extent  by  CYP2C19.  Macitentan  and  its  active 
metabolite  were  neither  a  substrate  nor  an  inhibitor  of  CYP  isoenzymes,  multi-drug  resistance 
protein (P-gp, MDR-1), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), and 
did not interact with proteins involved in hepatic bile salt transport (i.e. BSEP, NTCP).

Exposure 
Plasma  exposure  to  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  ACT-132577,  measured  over  a  24  h 
dosing  interval,  were  increased  by  approximately  10–30%  between  PAH  patients  and  healthy 
subjects. As the total daily exposure expressed in AUC is a more relevant reflection of exposure 
during chronic use than the Ctrough, the applicant proposed to reflect this information in section 
5.2 of the SmPC as follows:  
“The pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its active metabolite have mainly been documented in 
healthy  subjects.  Exposure  to  macitentan  in  patients  with  PAH  was  approximately  1.2-fold 
greater  than  in  healthy  subjects.  The  exposure  to  the  active  metabolite  in  patients,  which  is 
approximately  5-fold  less  potent  than  macitentan,  was  approximately  1.3-fold  higher  than  in 
healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan in PAH patients were not influenced by the 
severity of the disease.”  
The proposed SPC amendments are considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
After  repeated  administration,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  macitentan  are  dose-proportional  up  to 
and  including  30 mg.  In  patients,  no  trend  for  time-dependency  was  noted.  Inter-subject 
variability was low in healthy subjects and moderate in patients. 
In conclusion, this information is appropriately reflected in the SmPC as follows:  
After  repeated  administration,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  macitentan  are  dose  proportional  up  to 
and including 30mg.  
Elimination 
The  major  excretion  route  of  macitentan  in  humans,  in  the  form  of  metabolites,  is  via  urine, 
accounting  for  about  50%  of  the  dose,  while  approximately  24%  of  the  administered  dose  was 
recovered in faeces. Neither unchanged macitentan nor the active metabolite ACT-132577 were 
recovered in urine. 
Pharmacodynamics  
Macitentan  is  an  orally  potent  endothelin  receptor  antagonist,  active  on  both  ETA  and  ETB 
receptors and approximately 100-fold more for selective for ETA than ETB in vitro. Macitentan has 
a  circulating  active  metabolite  (ACT-132577)  that  is  also  a  dual  ERA,  is  on  average 
approximately 5-fold less potent than macitentan, and may contribute to the clinical effect.  
In the PK/PD model, increasing macitentan concentrations were associated with longer time from 
baseline  to  morbidity/mortality  event  and  with  an  increase  in  6MWD.  However,  no  clear 
separation  between  the  2 macitentan  doses  could  be  observed.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with 
an  event  who  provided  PK  data  at  EOT  was  small.  Thus,  the  results  should  be  interpreted 
cautiously  and  no  firm  conclusion  should  be  drawn.  Increasing  macitentan  concentrations  were 
associated with reductions in PVR, mPAP, and TPR and an increase in cardiac index. However, no 
relationship was established for mRAP and SvO2.

Data  from  ET  receptor  antagonism  in  clinical  pharmacology  studies  and  from  decreased  blood 
pressure  in  a  phase  II  study  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension  provides  an  adequate 
rationale for dose selection for the pivotal study in patients with PAH.  
Macitentan did not affect cardiac repolarization in nonclinical studies or in a thorough TQT study.  
In healthy volunteers (study AC-055-106), the administration of macitentan and sildenafil led to 
an  increase  in  headache  and  hypotension  as  compared  with  each  of  the  drugs  administered 
alone. In the double-blind PAH population, headache was reported at an incidence of 13.2% and 
13.6%  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  and  10  mg  groups,  respectively,  and  at  8.8%  in  the  placebo 
group. The incidence of headache in patients with concurrent PAH therapy was 14.0% (23/164) 
and  13.6%  (21/154)  on  macitentan  3  and  10  mg,  respectively,  versus  10.5%  (16/153)  on 
placebo.  These  data  do  not  indicate  a  higher  incidence  of  headache  associated  with  the 
administration of macitentan in patients receiving concurrent PAH therapy. Subgroup evaluation 
of  the  PT  ‘hypotension’  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population  showed  that  the  incidence  of 
hypotension  in  patients  with  concurrent  PAH  therapy  was  6.1%  (10/164)  and  4.5%  (7/154)  on 
macitentan  3  and  10  mg,  respectively,  versus  3.3%  (5/153)  on  placebo.  In  the  subgroup  not 
treated  with  a  specific  PAH  therapy,  the  incidence  of  hypotension  was  4.7%  (4/86)  and  9.1% 
(8/88) in macitentan 3 and 10 mg, respectively, versus 6.3% (6/96) on placebo. These data do 
not  suggest  a  higher  incidence  of  hypotension  AEs  associated  with  the  administration  of 
macitentan  in  patients  receiving  concurrent  PAH  therapy.  The  median  macitentan  trough 
concentrations  in  the  3 mg  and  10  mg  dose  groups  (89  and  276  ng/mL) predicted  increases  in 
the probability to have an AE of anaemia from 1.77% (placebo subjects) to 2.09% and 2.96%, 
respectively.  No  trend  was  observed  for  infrequent  AEs  (n<30  for  the  SMQs  teratogenicity, 
thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, menstrual disorder, and ovarian cysts) or for hepatic events (n = 
86). Appropriate information has been included in the SmPC. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment: 
The  relative  increase  in  exposure  to  macitentan  and  the  active  metabolite  observed  in  patients 
with severely impaired renal function (24% and 58% higher than those in healthy subjects) was 
below that achieved at the highest well-tolerated macitentan dose of 300 mg reported in the SAD 
study. No data are available in PAH patients with severe renal impairment.  
In  conclusion,  as  a  precautionary  measure,  additional  warnings  are  required  for  patients  with 
severe renal impairment and in patients undergoing dialysis. (see SmPC). 
Hepatic impairment 
Overall,  the  exposure  to  macitentan  and  its  active  metabolite  is  decreased  by  20%  in  patients 
with  hepatic  impairment,  without  differences  according  to  the  degree  of  impairment.  The 
differences  in  other  PK  parameters  between  hepatically  impaired  and  normal  subjects  are  even 
more irrelevant. Therefore, no dose-adjustment in hepatic impairment is deemed necessary. It is 
possible  that  the  PK  of  a  drug  differs  between  a  hepatically  impaired  subject  population  and  a 
healthy  population  treated  concomitantly  with  a  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor.  On  the  basis  of  the 
hepatic  impairment  study  AC-055-110,  the  applicant  hypothesises  that  the  decrease  in  intrinsic 
hepatic  clearance  due  to  a  decrease  in  enzyme-capacity  is  compensated  by  the  increase  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 44/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
unbound fraction leading to an unchanged hepatic drug clearance. Hepatic and liver function are 
further discussed in the clinical safety part. In summary, information related to hepatic function 
is  appropriately  reflected  in  the  SmPC  (see  contra  indication,  warnings,  undesirable  effects 
sections)and in the RMP.  
Gender/race/weight 
Females tend  to  have  a  longer  t1/2  and  plasma  through  concentration  for  both  macitentan  and 
ACT-132577,  leading  to  differences  in  exposure  when  compared  to  males.  However,  the  small 
difference  observed  could  be  confounded  by  body-weight  (female  subjects  had  a  body  weight 
12% lower than that of the male subjects). In conclusion, no specific information is warranted in 
the SmPC.  
There  were  no  large  differences  between  the  races  involved  in  the  studies  with  this  product. 
Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that,  in  the  different  races,  macitentan  does  not  show  clinical 
relevant pharmacokinetics differences. 
Analysis  by  weight  category  (<50  kg,  50–99  kg,  and  >100  kg)  did  not  indicate  a  clinically 
relevant  effect  of  weight  on  macitentan  exposure  at  Month  6  or  EOT.  .  A  decrease  of  trough 
plasma  concentrations  of  ACT-132577  with  weight  was  suggested  in  the  10  mg  dose  group  at 
Month  6,  but  this  observation  could  have  been  driven  by  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  a 
weight above 100 kg. 
Elderly population 
In the 14 dedicated PK studies, no subjects >65 were included. The PK studies were performed 
in a healthy subject population and the upper allowed age limit for inclusion varied between 45 
and  65  years  of  age.  The  SmPC  adequately  reflects  that  there  is  limited  clinical  experience  in 
patients over the age of 75 years, and therefore macitentan should be used with caution in this 
population. 
Paediatric population 
Twenty  patients  between  the  ages  of  12  and  <18  years  were  enrolled  in  SERAPHIN  study. 
Characterisation  of  PK  could  not  be  performed.  Therefore,  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  and  
additional data are needed to support any paediatric indication.  
Interaction studies 
In vivo DDI studies with warfarin, sildenafil and cyclosporine showed no relevant interaction with 
macitentan.  In  addition,  there  was  a  2-fold  increase  in  macitentan  exposure  with  concomitant 
ketoconazole  once  daily  (a  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor)  and  a  decrease  by  79%  in  macitentan 
exposure  with  concomitant  rifampicin  (a  potent  inducer  of  CYP3A4).  In  post-hoc  analyses,  the 
predicted  increase  was  approximately  3.0-fold  in  the  presence  of  ketoconazole  200  mg  twice 
daily, using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. 
In conclusion, a potential increase in macitentan exposure when using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
could  be  of  clinical  relevance.  In  view  of  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  data,  it  is  therefore 
acceptable to reflect this information in the SmPC in sections 4.4, and 4.5 accordingly.

In sections 4.4 and 4.5 the following warnings are mentioned: 
“Caution should be exercised when macitentan is administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors”. A warning is also added in case of concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers, to 
mention that reduced efficacy of macitentan could occur.  
No  specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies  with  hormonal  contraceptives  have  been  conducted. 
However,  the 
lack  of 
interaction  with  sildenafil 
indicates  that  no  clinically  relevant 
pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  macitentan  and  other  CYP3A4  substrates  would  occur. 
Overall, macitentan seems to have a low potential for interactions with other medicinal products. 
In  dose-ascending  studies  conducted  in  healthy  subjects  (Studies  AC-055-101  and  102),  dose-
dependent increases in the incidence of AEs were observed, headache being the more frequently 
reported adverse event. The relationship between exposure (trough plasma concentrations) and 
safety  in  PAH  patients  was  characterized  using  a  logistic  regression  model  based  on  the  data 
from study AC-055-302 (SERAPHIN). However, for adverse events, only the relationship between 
exposure  and  AEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  was  explored.  Only  a  small  number  of 
patients had an AE leading to study drug discontinuation (n = 26) in this analysis. On the other 
hand,  there  was  an  inverse  relationship  between  macitentan  trough  plasma  concentrations  and 
changes in haematocrit and haemoglobin levels; anaemia/haemoglobin decrease being the most 
important dose-related AE.  
No  concentration-dependent  impact  on  changes  in  liver  function  tests  could  be  established. 
Based on the results from the pivotal SERAPHIN study, no population/population subset has been 
identified  for  which  a  dose  below  10  mg  could  be  recommended,  without  risk  of  compromising 
the benefit that can be obtained with macitentan 10 mg.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  macitentan  has  generally  been  well  characterized.  However,  some 
additional  clarifications  and  SmPC  amendments  were  considered  necessary  in  some  particular 
subpopulations  (lack  of  appropriate  PK  data  in  children)  and  situations  (PK  interaction  with 
ketoconazole ; uncertainty about testicular safety; and hepatic impairment/toxicity). The agreed 
SmPC  adequately  reflects  the  current  knowledge  of  the  product  from  a  pharmacological 
perspective (see product information). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This  application  is  based on  a  single,  long-term,  pivotal  Phase  3  study,  AC-055-302/SERAPHIN. 
There  are  no  other  ongoing  Phase  3  studies  in  the  sought  indication.  Study  AC-055-201  in 
patients  with  essential  hypertension  contributed  data  on  the  dose-response  for  hemodynamic 
efficacy of macitentan and, thus, to the dose selection for the Phase 3 study in PAH (Table O-E-
01), and will be discussed under “Dose response study” section of this report. Studies SERAPHIN 
OL  (AC-055-303)  and  MUSIC  (AC-055B201)  in  patients  with  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF) 
contributed  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  data  for  the  proposed  dose  of  10  mg  macitentan 
OD, and will be discussed only in the “Clinical safety” section of this report.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  dedicated  dose-finding  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  PAH.  Instead,  the  applicant's 
strategy  was  to  employ  PD  data  on  ET-1  levels  (see  “pharmacodynamics”  section)  and 
hemodynamic  efficacy  data  on  blood  pressure  (BP)  reduction  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate 
essential hypertension to determine the doses to be tested in the Phase 3 clinical outcome study 
in  patients  with  PAH  (SERAPHIN).  The  underlying  assumption  was  that  a  dose  shown  to  be 
efficacious  in  systemic  hypertension  would  also  be  hemodynamically  effective  in  PAH,  as 
previously observed with the ERA bosentan (Krum, 1998).  
Dose  response  study  AC-055-201:  A  multi-center,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo- 
and  active-controlled,  parallel  group,  dose-ranging  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy, 
safety  and  tolerability  of  ACT-064992  in  subjects  with  mild-to-moderate  essential 
hypertension. 
Population and baseline characteristics 
A total of 314 subjects were enrolled. The per-protocol set for evaluation of the primary endpoint 
included placebo (n = 54), macitentan doses 0.3 mg (n = 54), 1 mg (n = 60); 3 mg (n = 57); 
10  mg  (n  =  56)  and  enalapril  (n  =  56).  Baseline  values  were  balanced  between  treatment 
groups;  subjects  with  rather  mild  hypertension  were  included  (SiDBP  at  randomization  97.6  ± 
2.5 mmHg [mean ± SD]).

Efficacy  
Treatment  with  the  10  mg  dose  of  macitentan  was  associated  with  a  statistically  significant 
reduction  vs  placebo  in  SiDBP  at  trough  (Figure  O-E-01).  The  response  to  macitentan  seemed 
dose-dependent  and  most  of  the  BP  reduction  was  reached  within  4  weeks  of  treatment. 
Secondary  and  exploratory  analyses  of  control  and  response  rates  showed  similar  treatment 
effects and trends.

baseline to end of double-blind period (placebo-adjusted). 
PK/PD results 
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that exposure in terms of Ctrough to both ACT-064992 and ACT-
132557  was  dose-proportional  over  the  dose  range  tested.  Pharmacodynamic  results  showed  a 
pronounced effect on endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in the 3- and 10-mg ACT-064992 dose groups. 
When pharmacokinetic (PK) and SiDBP at trough data are included in a mathematical model, the 
10 mg dose seemed to be close to the plateau of the pharmacological effect. 
Safety  
In study AC-055-201 in patients with essential hypertension, there were five cases of increases 
in liver transaminases >3×ULN, which led to the Sponsor's decision to end the study earlier than 
planned (see section 4 of current report for further discussion on hepatotoxicity).

Antagonist  in  Pulmonary  arterial  Hypertension  to  improve  cliNical  outcome:  A 
multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  event-
driven, Phase III study to assess the effects of macitentan on morbidity and mortality 
in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
The  clinical  evidence  based  on  the  results  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  macitentan  in  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  PAH  is  derived  from  study  AC-055-302/SERAPHIN  (Table  O-E-01). 
This  was  a  pivotal  placebo-controlled,  global  Phase  3  study,  which  enrolled  742  patients  with 
symptomatic PAH, randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to macitentan 3 mg OD, macitentan 10 mg OD, or 
placebo OD (Figure O-E-03).

Figure O-E-03. SERAPHIN study design. 
The  primary  objective  of the  long-term,  event-driven  SERAPHIN  study  was  to  demonstrate that 
macitentan reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality events during treatment in patients with 
PAH.  The  study  was  conducted  in  158  centres  in  39  countries,  between  25  May  2008  (first 
patient enrolled) and 15 March 2012 (last patient last visit). 
Methods 
The  study  included  a  screening  period  (up  to  28  days)  followed  by  a  treatment  period  from 
randomization  to  the  EOT  visit.  EOS  occurred  when  the  target  of  285  events  confirmed  by  the 
Clinical  Event  Committee  (CEC)  was  expected  to  have  been  achieved.  The  EOT  visit  either 
coincided  with  the  EOS  visit  for  patients  who  were  still  on  double-blind  study  treatment  or 
occurred earlier in case of premature discontinuation of study drug. Patients were encouraged to 
remain in the study after  EOT up to the EOS visit. Vital status follow-up at EOS was performed 
for  all  patients  who  had  not  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study  (i.e.,  died,  withdrawn 
consent  or  had  been  declared  lost  to  follow-up).  Patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  study 
treatment  (double-blind) due  to  worsening  of  PAH  and  obtained  written  approval  from  Actelion, 
and patients who completed the study as scheduled, could enter the open-label extension study, 
SERAPHIN  OL.  For  patients  who  had  opted  not  to  participate  or  who  were  not  eligible  to 
participate in the open-label extension study, SERAPHIN OL, a 28-day safety follow-up after EOT 
was performed. 
Study Participants  
A  total  of  699  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomized  and  742  patients  were  actually 
randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to macitentan 3 mg (250 patients), macitentan 10 mg (242 patients) or 
placebo (250 patients).

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion  
Patients aged 12 years or older at study entry, with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic PAH in 
modified WHO FC II to IV were eligible. The PAH aetiology was required to be within groups 1.1 
to  1.3  of  the  Venice  classification,  i.e.,  idiopathic  PAH,  familial  PAH,  PAH  related  to  collagen 
vascular disease, PAH associated with simple congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (at least 
1 year post surgical repair), HIV infection, or drugs and toxins. 
Randomization  into  the  study  required  a  PAH  diagnosis  confirmed  by  hemodynamic  evaluation 
showing: 
Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) >25 mmHg 
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) 
≤15 mmHg 
Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at rest ≥ 320 dyn×sec/cm5 
Patients were required to have a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) ≥ 50 m at baseline.  
Exclusion criteria 
There  were  a  total  of  23  exclusion  criteria.  Of  interest,  patients  with  PAH  associated  with  non-
corrected simple congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and, combined and complex systemic-
to-pulmonary  shunts,  corrected  or  non-corrected,  were  excluded.  The  criterion  of  “PAH 
associated  with  congenital  heart  disease”  in the  indication  was  amended  to  acknowledge that  it 
was limited to “PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease. 
Study treatments  
Altogether, 742 patients were randomized to macitentan 3 mg, macitentan 10 mg, or matching 
placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients received macitentan or placebo tablets OD, in addition to their 
usual PAH treatment (if applicable and allowed by the protocol).  
Patients  randomized  into  the  study  were  either  naïve  to  a  PAH-specific  treatment  or  could  be 
undergoing treatment with oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors, oral or inhaled prostanoids, calcium 
channel  blockers,  or  L-arginine,  provided  that  the  dose  had  been  stable  for  at  least  3  months 
prior  to  randomization.  Any  change  of  dose  in  the  absence  of  PAH  worsening  was  strongly 
discouraged  during  the  study.  Concomitant  treatment  with  oral  diuretics  was  allowed,  provided 
the patient had been on stable dose for at least 1 month prior to randomization. Optimization of 
the dose of oral diuretics was allowed during the treatment period. 
Prohibited concomitant medications 
1) ERAs (e.g., bosentan and ambrisentan) unless they were initiated for clinical worsening of PAH 
and  after  study  drug  discontinuation;  2)  Intravenous  or  subcutaneous  prostanoids  (e.g., 
epoprostenol,  treprostinil)  unless  they  were  initiated  for  a  morbidity  event;  3)  Specific 
immunosuppressants:  calcineurin  or  mTOR  inhibitors  (e.g.,  cyclosporine  A  and  tacrolimus, 
everolimus,  sirolimus);  4)  CYP3A  inducers  (carbamazepine,  rifampin,  rifabutin  and  St  John’s 
wort); 5) Any investigational drug other than the study drug.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  either  dose  (3  mg  or  10  mg)  of 
macitentan reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic PAH. 
Secondary objectives of the study were: 
To  demonstrate  that  either  dose  (3  mg  or  10  mg)  of  macitentan  improves  exercise  capacity, 
WHO functional class (FC), and reduces the risk of death due to PAH or hospitalization for PAH up 
to end-of-treatment (EOT) in patients with symptomatic PAH. 
To demonstrate that either dose (3 mg or 10 mg) of macitentan reduces the risk of death of all 
causes up to EOT and up to end-of-study (EOS). 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of macitentan in patients with symptomatic PAH. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary objective of reduction in the risk of a morbidity or mortality event was assessed as 
the time from start of treatment to the first morbidity or mortality event up to EOT, defined as 
follows: 
Death,  or  onset  of  a  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (AE)  with  a  fatal  outcome  occurring 
within 4 weeks of study treatment discontinuation, or 
Atrial septostomy or hospitalization for atrial septostomy, or 
Lung transplantation or hospitalization for lung transplantation, or 
Initiation  of  intravenous  or  subcutaneous  prostanoids  (e.g.,  epoprostenol,  treprostinil)  or 
hospitalization for initiation of intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoids, or 
Other  worsening  of  PAH,  defined  by  the  combined  occurrence  in  a  patient  of  all  the  following 
three events: 
At  least  15%  decrease  in  the  6MWD  from  baseline,  confirmed  by  two  6-minute  walk  tests 
(6MWT), performed on separate days, within 2 weeks of each other. 
AND 
Worsening of PAH symptoms that included at least one of the following: Increase in WHO FC, or 
no change in patients in WHO FC IV at baseline; Appearance or worsening of signs/symptoms of 
right heart failure that did not respond to optimized oral diuretic therapy 
AND 
Need for new treatment(s) for PAH that included the following: Oral or inhaled prostanoids (e.g., 
iloprost);  Oral  phosphodiesterase  inhibitors  (e.g.,  sildenafil);  Endothelin  receptor  antagonists 
(e.g.,  bosentan,  ambrisentan)  only  after  discontinuation  of  the  study  treatment;  Intravenous 
diuretics

The observation period for the primary endpoint started with first drug intake and ended at EOT 
+  7  days.  Patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  study  treatment  without  a  morbidity  or 
mortality  event  were  censored  at  the  time  of  study  treatment  discontinuation  plus  7  days. 
Patients without an event at EOS (declared by the sponsor on 30 January 2012) were censored 
for the primary endpoint at their last visit in the study. An independent clinical event committee 
(CEC) reviewed all morbidity and mortality events in a blinded fashion and adjudicated (qualified 
or disqualified) these events for the main analysis of the primary endpoint. Furthermore, the CEC 
also  adjudicated  the  type  of  primary  endpoint  event  and  confirmed  whether  a  mortality  event 
was due to PAH.

protocol-defined  endpoint  was  clarified  in  the  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP)  prior  to 
unblinding): Death due to PAH (as identified by CEC) up to EOT + 7 days, or onset of a 
treatment-emergent  AE  with  a  fatal  outcome  due  to  PAH  occurring  up  to  4  weeks  after 
EOT, or Hospitalization for PAH up to EOT + 7 days. 
Time to death of all causes up to EOT that included (The protocol-defined endpoint was 
clarified in the SAP prior to unblinding): Death of all causes up to EOT + 7 days, or onset 
of a treatment-emergent AE with a fatal outcome occurring up to 4 weeks after EOT (The

unblinding). 
Time  to  death  of  all  causes  up  to  EOS  (This  protocol  defined  exploratory  endpoint  was 
changed to a secondary endpoint in the SAP). 
Exploratory endpoints investigated the effects of macitentan on changes in 6MWD, Borg dyspnea 
index and WHO FC at each assessed time-point, quality of life (QoL), and N-terminal pro-B type 
natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels. 
Pharmacodynamic  endpoints  investigated  the  effects  of  macitentan  on  changes  in  PVR,  mean 
right  atrial  pressure  (mRAP),  mean  pulmonary  pressure  (mPP),  cardiac  index  (CI),  total 
pulmonary resistance (TPR) and mixed venous oxygen saturation from baseline to Month 6 in a 
sub-study to the overall protocol. 
Pharmacoeconomic endpoints: 
Number per year of all-cause and PAH-related hospitalizations from baseline up to EOT; Number 
per  year  of  in-patient  hospital  days  for  all  causes  and  PAH-related  causes  from  baseline  up  to 
EOT. 
Sample size 
The  anticipated  sample  size  for  this  study  was  699  patients  randomized  to  treatment  using  a 
1:1:1 ratio. A total of 285 events were needed to detect a hazard ratio for macitentan/placebo of 
0.55 for at least one dose group over an estimated maximum study duration of 4.1 years (using 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 52/105 
 
  
  
 
 
a hazard rate of 0.43 in the placebo group, an expected hazard ratio of 0.05 per year for attrition 
and an accrual rate of 200 patients per year). For sample size calculations, type-I error was set 
to  0.005  (two-sided,  Bonferroni  correction  to  ensure  an  overall  alpha  level  of  0.01)  and  power 
was set to 90% A planned blinded sample size re-estimation was performed 3 months before the 
end of expected recruitment which led to a revised expected hazard rate of 0.28 in the placebo 
group,  resulting  in  the  decision  to  increase  the  initial  planned  sample  size  (n  =  525)  to  699  to 
maintain the planned study duration. The planned sample re-sizing had no impact on the results 
in  the  primary  endpoint  and  change  in  6MWD,  according  to  ancillary  analyses  provided  by  the 
applicant. 
Randomisation 
Patients  who  satisfied  the  eligibility  criteria  were  randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive 
macitentan (3 mg or 10 mg) or placebo using a centralized randomization system via Interactive 
Voice Response (IVR) or Interactive Web Response (IWR). An independent service provider was 
responsible  for  the  central  randomization  services.  A  unique  4-digit  randomization  number  was 
assigned to each patient. Randomization was stratified by centre and the block size used was a 
combination  of  3  and  6.  The  randomization  code  was  to  be  unblinded/broken  by  Actelion  GQM 
and  made  available  for  data  analysis  only  after  study  closure,  i.e.,  when  the  study  was 
completed,  the  protocol  violations  were  determined,  and  the  clinical  database  was  declared 
complete, accurate and locked. The password was requested by an authorized person at Actelion 
GQM  on  23  April 2012  and  the  randomization  code was  made  available  for  analysis  on  26  April 
2012. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  study  was  performed  in  a  double-blind  fashion.  The  two  dose  strengths  of  macitentan  and 
placebo were indistinguishable and all study drug kits were packaged in the same way. The SDAC 
(Statistical Data Analysis Center) had access to the randomization codes and was responsible for 
the overall preparation of the data for review by the DSMB and for preparing interim reports for 
review by the DSMB based on the data generated by Actelion. The investigator and study staff, 
the  patients,  the  monitors,  and  Actelion  employees  and  contractors  remained  blinded  to  the 
study drug allocation until the database closure on 26 April 2012.  
Statistical methods 
The  null  hypothesis  was  that,  independently  for  each  dose  group  of  macitentan  (3  mg  and  10 
mg), there was no difference between macitentan and placebo for the risk of first occurrence of a 
morbidity  or  mortality  event  up  to  EOT  (the  primary  endpoint).  To  keep  the  study-wise  type-I 
error to a two-sided 0.01 ‘conclusive’ (and highly statistically significant) level in the presence of 
multiple  tests,  each  comparison  of  active  dose  versus  placebo  was  tested  at  a  nominal  type-I 
error level of 0.005 (two-sided) according to Bonferroni’s approach, with testing starting from the 
primary endpoint. The study could also be declared ‘positive’ at a global significance level of 0.05 
(statistically significant). According to Bonferroni’s approach, the comparison of each active dose 
versus placebo was to be tested at a nominal type-I error level of 0.025 (two-sided), with testing 
starting  from  the  primary  endpoint.  The  secondary  endpoints  were  analyzed  hierarchically  for 
each dose group in the sequence of change in 6MWD (Wilcoxon rank sum test), change in WHO

FC (Fisher’s exact test), time to death or hospitalization due to PAH up to EOT, and time to death 
of  all  causes  up  to  EOT  and  EOS  (all  logrank  test).  No  further  alpha  adjustment  was  necessary 
for  the  secondary  endpoints  due  to  the  hierarchical  testing  procedure.  No  confirmatory  claims 
can  be  based  on  variables  that  have  a  rank  lower  than  or  equal  to  that  variable  whose  null 
hypothesis  was  the  first  that  could  not  be  rejected.  Efficacy  endpoints  were  analyzed  using  the 
All-randomized  set  (all  randomized  patients  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  they  received  study 
drug).  The  logrank  test  with  no  adjustment  for  covariates  was  used  to  compare  the  treatment 
effect of macitentan versus placebo for the primary endpoint. The treatment effect was estimated 
using  Cox’s  proportional  hazard  model.  All  time  to  event  variables  were  estimated  using  the 
Kaplan-Meier  method.  The  exploratory  endpoints  were  analyzed  descriptively.  Safety  data  were 
analyzed  descriptively  using  the  All-treated  set  (all  randomized  patients  who  received  study 
drug). 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  955  patients  were  screened  from  158  centres  in  39  countries  and  742  patients  from 
151 centres in 39 countries were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the macitentan 3 mg (n = 250), 
macitentan  10  mg  (n  =  242)  and  placebo  groups  (n  =  250)  (Figure  O-E-04).  A  total  of  590 
patients  (79.5%)  completed  the  study  as  planned.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  prematurely 
discontinued  the  study  was  22.4%  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  group,  16.9%  in  the  macitentan  10 
mg  group,  and  22.0%  in  the  placebo  group.  Death  was  the  main  reason  for  patients  not  being 
able  to  complete  the  study  in  all  three  groups  (18.8%  macitentan  3  mg,  14.0%  macitentan  10 
mg,  17.6%  placebo).  Other  reasons  for  premature  discontinuation  from  the  study  included 
withdrawal of consent (2.4% macitentan 3 mg, 1.7% macitentan 10 mg, 1.2% placebo) and loss 
to follow up (1.2% macitentan 3 mg, 0.8% macitentan 10 mg, 2.8% placebo).

Premature  discontinuation  from  treatment  or  EOT  is  the  date  of  discontinuation  from  treatment.  Patients  could 
discontinue  study  treatment  at  any  time  following  randomization.  EOT  coincided  with  EOS  for  patients  who  were  still  on 
study drug on the date of study completion (30 January 2012, announced by Actelion). 
Premature  discontinuation  from  study:  Patients  no  longer  alive/willing/available  to  provide  vital  status  following 
sponsor’s announced EOS (30 January 2012, announced by Actelion). 
Study completed: Patients from whom vital status could be collected following sponsor-announced EOS independent of an 
earlier discontinuation from the treatment.

Russia  and  China  were  the  only  countries  contributing  more  than  20  patients  per  group.  There 
was  a  significant  difference  in  patient  recruitment  by  region  before  and  after  sample  size  re-
sizing.  Most  patients  from  Asia  and  North-America  were  recruited  after  sample  size  re-sizing, 
while in the remaining regions most patients were recruited before sample size re-sizing.  
Conduct of the study 
Four  protocol  amendments  were  made  and  the  most  important  was  amendment  3  related  to 
increase in sample size (See “sample size” subsection).  
Baseline data 
A summary of the demographic characteristics for the ‘All-randomized set’ is provided in Table O-
E-02.  In  general,  the  demographic  characteristics  across  the  three  treatment  groups  were  well 
matched.  There  was  a  predominance  of  females  and  the  median  age  was  approximately  45 
years. Approximately 14% of the patients were elderly (age > 65) and 3% were adolescents (12-
17 years). Average body mass index (BMI) was approximately 25 kg/m2. Ethnically, the patients 
were  predominantly  Caucasian  or  Asian,  reflecting  the  fact  that  the  majority  were  recruited  at 
centres in Europe and Asia.

Table O-E-02. Summary of patient demographics, All-randomized set 
The  mean  time  from  PAH  diagnosis  to  randomization  in  the  study  population  was  2.7  years 
(Table  O-E-03).  Idiopathic  PAH  was  the  most  common  aetiology  (55%)  followed  by  PAH  due  to 
collagen vascular disease (30%) and PAH due to congenital shunts (8%). It is worth mentioning 
that  the  term  “congenital shunts”  corresponds  to  PAH  associated to  corrected simple  congenital 
systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts,  since  patients  with  PAH  associated  with  non-corrected  simple 
congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and  combined  and  complex  systemic-to-pulmonary 
shunts were excluded. . In the indication this subpopulation was limited to “PAH associated with 
corrected simple congenital heart disease”. Familial (heritable) PAH and PAH due to HIV infection 
and drugs and toxins represented 3% or less.

Table O-E-03. Summary of baseline characteristics, All-randomized set 
Baseline mean 6MWD was approximately 360 m. The mean Borg dyspnoea index at baseline was 
approximately  3.5  across  the  groups  (Table  E-03).  At  baseline,  approximately  52%  of  patients 
were in WHO FC II and 46% of patients were in WHO FC III, with only 14 patients (2%) in WHO 
FC  IV  (Table  O-E-03).  During  the  procedure,  patients  in  WHO  FC  IV  were  removed  from  the 
indication due to the very limited data available. 
At  least  one  sign  of  right  heart  failure  was  reported  for  approximately  31%  of  patients  at 
baseline  (Table  E-03).  Ancillary  analyses  of  the  primary  and  main  secondary  outcome  in  the 
population with heart failure were consistent with the results in the overall study population. 
Results 
All 742 patients were included in the ‘All-randomized set’. One patient in the placebo group never 
received study treatment and therefore, a total of 741 patients were included in the ‘All-treated 
set’.  The  ‘Per-protocol  set’  included  675  of  the  randomized  patients  (91%)  with  a  total  of  67 
patients (9%) excluded from this set. 
Premature discontinuations from treatment 
Of  the  741  patients  in  the  ‘All-treated  set’,  373  (50.3%)  discontinued  study  treatment 
prematurely  (Table  E-05).  The  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  study  treatment  was 
47.2% in the macitentan 3 mg group, 44.2% in the macitentan 10 mg group, and 59.4% in the

placebo  group.  Disease  progression  followed  by  enrolment  in  the  SERAPHIN  OL  was  the  most 
frequent reason for discontinuation of study treatment in all three groups (22.8% macitentan 3 
mg, 20.7% macitentan 10 mg, 32.1% placebo). An AE led to discontinuation of study treatment 
in  13.6%  macitentan  3  mg,  10.7%  macitentan  10 mg,  and  12.4%  placebo. These  AEs  included 
disease  progression  (without  subsequent  enrolment  into  the  SERAPHIN  OL  study)  in  6.8%  of 
patients  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  group,  3.7%  of  patients  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  group,  and 
8.0% of patients in the placebo group. Other reasons included death, withdrawal from treatment 
(i.e.,  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment,  but  with  the  patient’s  agreement  to  be 
contacted at EOS to check vital status), withdrawal of consent and administrative reasons.  
Table O-E-04. Summary of reasons for discontinuation of treatment, All-treated set. 
Missing data for mortality after EoT  
A total of 27 patients did not complete the study and therefore vital status was missing at EOS, 
i.e., lost to follow-up, etc.). Missing data were well balanced by treatment group. The results of 
the sensitivity analyses using the Best-case, Base-case and Worst-case scenarios were similar to 
that  of  the  primary  analysis  for  the time  to  death  up  to  EOS,  with  risk  reductions  ranging  from 
33% to 16% across all analyses (none of them statistically significant). The primary analysis risk 
reduction of 23% falls within that range. 
Protocol violations 
A  total of  67  randomized patients  (9%)  were  excluded  from  the  ‘per-protocol  set’ due  to  major 
protocol deviations. Overall, the proportion of patients with major protocol deviations was similar 
across the groups (9.2% macitentan 3 mg, 9.1% macitentan 10 mg, 8.8% placebo). Introduction 
of  a  new  treatment  for  PAH  or  a  change  in  treatment  dose  without  documented  disease 
worsening  were  the  most  common  deviations  in  all  groups  (4.8%  macitentan  3  mg,  4.5% 
macitentan 10 mg, 3.6% placebo).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint:  
A  confirmed  primary  endpoint  event  was  recorded  for  95  patients  and  76  patients  in  the 
macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, versus 116 patients in the placebo group (EOT 
+  7  days)  (Figure  E-05).  In  the  time-to-event  analysis,  the  hazard  ratio  versus  placebo  for  the 
occurrence of the primary endpoint in the macitentan 3 mg group was 0.704 (97.5% CLs 0.516, 
0.960,  logrank  p  =  0.0108)  (Figure  E-05).  In  the  macitentan  10  mg  dose  group,  the  effect 
versus  placebo  was  highly  statistically  significant  as  measured  by  the  hazard  ratio  of  0.547 
(97.5% CLs 0.392, 0.762, logrank p < 0.0001). For the 10 mg dose it corresponded to an overall 
relative risk reduction of 45% and a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of 6 patients (95% CLs 4.48, 
10.80)  to  avoid  one  event  at  2  years.  The  Kaplan-Meier  curves  of  the  first  event  in  the  ‘All-
randomized set’ are shown in Figure 3. The separation between macitentan groups and placebo 
appeared  early  and  was  clearly  established  at  6  months  (Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  primary 
endpoint event-free rate 89.3% macitentan 3 mg group, 92.7% macitentan 10 mg group, 80.1% 
placebo group). The treatment effect of macitentan was sustained for the duration of the study: 
at  all  time-points,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  not  experienced  a  morbidity  or  mortality 
event was greater in the macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg groups than in the placebo group.

Components of the primary endpoint events 
The  most  frequently  first-reported  CEC-confirmed  event  was  “Other  worsening  of  PAH”  (Table 
OE-06). The proportion of patients with “Other worsening of PAH” was 28.8% in the macitentan 
3  mg  group  and  24.4%  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  group,  compared  to  37.2%  in  the  placebo 
group.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  death  as  the  first  event  was  8.4%  (21  patients)  in  the 
macitentan  3  mg  group,  6.6%  (16  patients)  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  group,  and  6.8%  (17 
patients)  in  the  placebo  group,  questioning  any  claim  for  a  mortality  benefit  with  macitentan. 
This is further confirmed in the competing risk analysis (fig OE-06).

of  the  analyses  for  time to  first  event  and  the  risk  reduction with  macitentan,  using  the  CHMP-
defined morbidity/mortality event, were consistent with the results of the primary analysis of the 
SERAPHIN  study.  In  the  time-to-event  analysis,  the  HR  versus  placebo  for  the  occurrence  of  a 
CHMP-defined  event  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  dose  group  was  0.550  (97.5%CI:  0.417,  0.725; 
logrank  p<0.0001).  In  the  macitentan  3  mg  group  was  0.737  (97.5%  CI:  0.568,  0.956; 
p=0.0083).  The  corresponding  relative  risk  reductions  versus  placebo  were  45%  and  26%, 
respectively.

The  treatment  effects  adjusted  for  covariates  (sex,  region,  race,  PAH  therapy  at  baseline,  PAH 
etiology  and  WHO  FC  at  baseline)  of  both  macitentan  dose  groups  were  consistent  with  the 
unadjusted results of the main analysis. 
Subgroup analyses 
The  p-values  for  the  statistical  test  of  interaction  did  not  formally  show  heterogeneity  of  the 
treatment  effect  (macitentan  versus  placebo)  for  any  of  the  subgroup  analyses.  The  point 
estimate was above 1 only in North-America, but the confidence limits were wide due to the low 
sample size in that region.

Paediatric patients 
There  was  limited  recruitment  of  paediatric  patients  in  SERAPHIN  (n=20),  which  could  be 
expected  in  an  orphan  indication.  However,  unlike  the  adult  population,  70%  of  the  patients 
discontinued the medication because of disease progression. It is difficult to comment further on 
the efficacy data considering this high drop-out rate, but the results do not point to any benefit 
compared to the placebo. In line with the efficacy data, reported safety data concern worsening 
of PAH and right ventricular failure. The SmPC has been amended to acknowledge that the safety 
and efficacy of macitentan in children have not yet been established. 
Right heart failure 
A 43.7% of the patients enrolled in the SERAPHIN study met the criteria of right heart failure at 
baseline.  Post-hoc  analyses  in  this  subgroup  are  consistent  with  those  in  the  overall  SERAPHIN 
population. The findings do not indicate that a potential increase in fluid retention would offset or 
impact negatively on the benefit of macitentan on morbidity/mortality in this population.  
Main secondary endpoint: change in 6MWD from baseline to month 6. 
The  placebo-corrected  median  change  in  6MWD  from  baseline  to  Month  6  showed  similar 
treatment  effects  versus  placebo  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  (14.0  m,  97.5%  CLs  2.0,  27.0, 
Wilcoxon  rank  sum  p  =  0.0122)  and  macitentan  10  mg  groups  (15.0  m,  97.5%  CLs  2.0,  28.0, 
Wilcoxon  rank  sum  p  =  0.0078)  (Table  OE-07).  The  corresponding  mean  (±  standard  deviation 
[SD])  treatment  effect  was  16.8  m  (±  96.95)  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  group  and  22.0  m  (± 
92.58) in the macitentan 10 mg group.

Change in 6MWD across subgroups 
Examination  of  6MWD  in  WHO  FC  I/II  and  WHO  FC  III/IV  patients  shows  that  the  treatment 
effects  with  macitentan  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  other  studies  with  WHO  FC  II 
patient  population  [Galiè  2008]  or  a  WHO  FC  III/IV  patient  population  [Rubin  2002].  It  also 
appears  that  macitentan  provides  symptomatic  benefit  when  used  concomitantly  with  PAH 
background  medications.  These  findings  differ  from  the  experience  gained  from  earlier  clinical 
trials  (PHIRST,  EARLY,  PACES  and  TRIUMPH),  but  are  similar  to  those  recently  published 
PATENT-1  study  (riociguat).  Some  imbalances  in  the  geographic  areas  and  aetiologies  between 
the treatment naïve patients and patients on background PAH therapy could be the cause of such 
observation, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn. 
Death-related secondary and exploratory analyses 
Results of the secondary and exploratory analyses of SERAPHIN in which mortality was either a 
component of the endpoint or the endpoint itself are presented in Table O-E-08. With macitentan 
10 mg, the risk reductions versus placebo in death or hospitalization due to PAH up to EOT + 7 
days were up to 50% and statistically significant, while the reduction with macitentan 3 mg was 
33%. A similar trend was seen for all cause death and death due to PAH for the 10 mg dose, but 
none of the comparisons was statistically significant. There was a neutral effect of the macitentan 
Assessment report

Page 63/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
3  mg  dose  versus  placebo  on  mortality  (Table  O-E-09).  The  relative  risk  reduction  in  death-
related  endpoints  was  generally  smaller  for  the  entire  study  period  compared  to  the  period  of 
analysis for the primary endpoint that covers the treatment phase only. This can be explained by 
the transition of the majority of placebo patients who experienced a non-fatal primary endpoint 
event  in  SERAPHIN  to  alternative  therapies,  including  treatment  with  macitentan  10  mg  in  the 
SERAPHIN  OL  study.  However,  despite  the  small  overall  number  of  deaths  irrespective  of  the 
length  of  the  observation  period,  the  observed  positive  effect  of  macitentan  10  mg  on  survival 
was consistent. These findings also illustrate the difficulties in conducting survival studies in PAH, 
as  patients  experiencing  a  worsening  of  PAH  primary  events  cannot  be  left  untreated.  With  a 
median  post-event  survival  of  over  two  years,  an  adequately  powered  survival  study  would 
require more than 3500 patients, which is not feasible in rare disease like PAH. 
Table O-E-09. Results of the death-related endpoints of SERAPHIN, All-randomized set 
The applicant also conducted landmark analyses to show that in SERAPHIN, a morbidity event, as 
defined  in  the  SERAPHIN  study  protocol,  was  a  significant  risk  factor  for  subsequent  death. 
Although  the  mortality  results  are  not  inconsistent  with  those  of  the  main  composite  endpoint, 
the point estimate tends to be of a lesser magnitude than that of the composite endpoint (mainly 
driven by worsening of PAH), and statistical significance is not achieved for mortality.  
 Other endpoints of clinical relevance  
Change in WHO FC 
Improvements in WHO FC from baseline to Month 6 were reported for 19.8% of patients in the 
macitentan  3  mg  group  and  22.3%  of  patients  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  group,  compared  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 64/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
12.9%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  This  translates  into  a  54%  higher  chance  of  WHO  FC 
improvement relative to placebo for patients in the 3 mg dose group (relative risk 1.54, 97.5% 
CLs  0.96,  2.46,  p  =  0.0395)  and  a  74%  higher  chance  of  WHO  FC  improvement  relative  to 
placebo  in  patients  in  the  10  mg  dose  group  (relative  risk  1.74,  97.5%  CLs  1.10,  2.74,  p  = 
0.0063). 
Borg dyspnoea index The estimated treatment effect over 12 months compared to placebo was 
– 0.47 (95% CLs – 0.72, – 0.22, p = 0.0002) for macitentan 3 mg and – 0.38 (95% CLs –0.63, – 
0.13, p = 0.0029) for macitentan 10 mg (a negative difference favours macitentan).  
Change  in  N-terminal  pro-B  type  natriuretic  peptide  (NT-pro-BNP)  from  baseline  to 
Month 6 
The  median  change  versus  placebo  in  NT-pro-BNP  (a  biomarker  predicting  right  ventricular 
overload) from baseline to Month 6 was –130 fmol/mL (97.5% CLs –202, –65) with macitentan 3 
mg and –160 fmol/mL (97.5% CLs –235, –95) with macitentan 10 mg. The applicant compared 
NT-proBNP  levels  within  the  SERAPHIN  study.  Higher  baseline  and  higher  absolute  values  at 
Month  6  were  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  morbidity  and  mortality,  however  no  prognostic 
value of change from baseline was observed. 
Effect on quality of life 
The normalized treatment effect (vs placebo) on the mean change from baseline to Month 6 was 
significantly in favour of macitentan (both doses) in the scores of the individual domains (norm-
based)  of  physical  functioning,  role  physical,  pain  index,  vitality,  social  functioning,  role 
emotional,  mental  health  index,  physical  and  mental  component  summary  scores,  with  mean 
score improvements ranging between 2.6 to 3.8. 
Effect of macitentan on hospitalizations 
Treatment  with  macitentan  reduces  the  number  of  hospitalizations  and  days  in  hospital  by 
approximately 50%.  
Effect  of  macitentan  on  hemodynamics:  Hemodynamic  endpoints  (change  in  PVR  and  CI 
from  baseline  to  Month  6)  were  analyzed  in  a  sub-set  of  the  SERAPHIN  population  who 
participated  in  the  PK/PD  sub-study  (n  =  187).  Macitentan  was  associated  with  a  treatment 
effect  on  pulmonary  hemodynamics  compared  to  placebo,  which  was  of  a  magnitude  similar  to 
that observed with other ERAs treatments for PAH. There was no clear difference between the 3 
mg  and  10  mg  doses  on  any  of  the  hemodynamic  variables  collected  in  the  overall  population. 
The  applicant  explained  that  in  treatment-naïve  patients  administered  macitentan,  a  dose 
response  can  be  demonstrated  on  PVR  and  to  a  lesser  extent  on  CI.  This  is  in  line  with 
observations made with ambrisentan and sildenafil. However such dose response is not observed 
in patients already on PAH therapy.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is based on the results of a single, long-term, double-blind pivotal Phase 3 study, 
AC-055-302/SERAPHIN. The pivotal study included a clinically relevant primary endpoint (time to 
clinical worsening or time to first morbidity or mortality event).  
SERAPHIN is the largest study conducted so far in PAH (n=742) and included a wide population 
of  PAH  patients  (n=742)  with  different  ages,  aetiologies,  FC  and  background  medications. 
However, some populations were under-represented. There was limited recruitment of paediatric 
patients  in  SERAPHIN  (n=20).  Unlike  the  adult  population,  70%  of  the  paediatric  patients 
discontinued  the  medication  because  of  disease  progression,  which  do  not  support  the  use  of 
macitentan in children.  
Almost all patients were in WHO FC II-III, while only 1 patient was in FC I and only 14 patients 
were in FC IV. As a result, patients on FC I and IV have been removed from the indication due to 
the very limited data available. Idiopathic PAH was the most common aetiology (55%) followed 
by  PAH  due  to  connective  tissue  (30%)  and  PAH  due  to  congenital  shunts  (8%).  This  latter 
subpopulation  only  included  PAH  associated  to  corrected  simple  congenital  systemic-to-
pulmonary  shunts,  since  patients  with  PAH  associated  with  non-corrected  simple  congenital 
systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and  combined  and  complex  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  were 
excluded.  Therefore,  “PAH  due  to  congenital  shunts”  has  been  excluded  from  the  indication 
initially applied for.  
At  baseline,  the  majority  (approximately  64%)  of  patients  were  receiving  at  least  one 
background  PAH  therapy  at  baseline.  Sildenafil  was  the  most  common  PAH  therapy  and  was 
taken by approximately 58% of patients across the groups.

The  patients  were  predominantly  Caucasian  (54.5%)  or  Asian  (27.7%),  reflecting  the  fact  that 
the  majority  of  patients  were  recruited  at  centres  in  Europe  and  Asia.  Approximately  43.7%  of 
the  patients  enrolled  in  the  SERAPHIN  study  met  the  criteria  of  right  heart  failure  at  baseline. 
The analysis of the primary and main secondary outcome in the population with heart failure was 
consistent with the results in the overall study population. In addition, a planned sample size re-
sizing  was  conducted  during  the  study,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  the  initially  planned  sample 
size. Additional analysis shows no influence of the sample size increase in the final study results. 
The study was well designed and also well conducted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  endpoint  analysis  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  effect  of  macitentan  10  mg  to 
reduce  the  risk  of  occurrence  of  a  morbidity  or  mortality  event  in  the  study  population,  which 
was  below  the  prespecified  significance  criteria  (p<0.001)  for  a  “conclusive  study”  [HR:  0.547 
(97.5%  CLs  0.392,  0.762,  logrank  p  <  0.0001].  In  contrast,  the  corresponding  HR  for  the 
macitentan  3  mg  group  versus  placebo  was  0.704  [97.5%  CI:  0.516  to  0.960;  logrank  p  = 
0.0108).  The  treatment  effect  with  macitentan  on  the  primary  endpoint  was  established  early 
and was sustained during treatment (median duration of more than 2 years). For the 10 mg dose 
it corresponded to an overall relative risk reduction of 45% and a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 
of 6 patients (95% CLs 4.48, 10.80) to avoid one event at 2 years. Results of sensitivity analyses 
for the primary endpoint were consistent with those of the main analysis.  
The Applicant was asked to perform a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint using the 
components recommended in the PAH guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008). 
The most frequent first-reported morbidity or mortality event in all groups was ‘other worsening 
of  PAH’  (28.8%  macitentan  3  mg,  24.4%  macitentan  10  mg,  37.2%  placebo).  The  effect  of 
macitentan  10  mg  was  generally  consistent  across  subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses.  In  the 
time-to-event analysis, the HR versus placebo for the occurrence of a CHMP-defined event in the 
macitentan  10  mg  dose  group  was  0.550  (97.5%CI:  0.417,  0.725;  logrank  p<0.0001).  In  the 
macitentan  3  mg  group  was  0.737  (97.5%  CI:  0.568,  0.956;  p=0.0083).  The  corresponding 
relative  risk  reductions  versus  placebo  were  45%  and  26%,  respectively,  which  are  broadly 
similar  to  the  results  of  the  main  analysis.The  applicant’s  reanalysis  was  consistent  with  the 
analysis of the main outcome as defined in SERAPHIN.  
The  secondary  endpoints  (change  in  6MWD,  separate  components  of  the  primary  endpoint, 
hemodynamic  endpoints,  dyspnoea  symptoms,  NT-pro-BNP  levels  and  QoL  endpoints  were 
considered exploratory and appropriate. The tested doses (3 mg and 10 mg) were well justified 
on  the  basis  of  PD  data  and  the  median  exposure  exceeded  2  years.  Based  on  the  PK/PD  and 
efficacy data provided, the recommendation of the 10mg dose is appropriately justified. 
Regarding  mortality,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  death  as  the  first  event  was  8.4%  in  the 
macitentan 3 mg group, 6.6% in the macitentan 10 mg group, and 6.8% in the placebo group, 
questioning  any  claim  for  a  mortality  benefit  with  macitentan.  This  is  further  confirmed  in  the 
competing  risk  analysis  (fig  OE-06).  Although  the  mortality  results  are  not  inconsistent  with 
those of the main composite endpoint, the point estimate tends to be of a lesser magnitude than 
that of the composite endpoint (mainly driven by worsening of PAH), and statistical significance 
is  not  achieved  for  mortality.  According  to  the  “Guideline  on  the  clinical  investigations  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 68/105 
 
  
  
 
medicinal  products 
for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (Doc.  Ref. 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008):  “Specific  claims  on  mortality  can  only  be  supported  by  long-
term  controlled  studies  including  death  as  a  primary  endpoint”.  While  acknowledging  the  big 
effort of the company to conduct the largest clinical trial so far in PAH, a mortality claim cannot 
be included in section 4.1 due to the above-mentioned reasons.  
During the procedure, the CHMP requested the applicant to propose a wording of the indication in 
line  with  the  PAH  guideline,  and  the  SERAPHIN  results  showing  delay  in  “time  to  clinical 
worsening”.  The  applicant  did  not  accept,  arguing  that  this  is  already  stated  in  Section  5.1  for 
several  PAH  medicines  (bosentan,  ambrisentan,  sildenafil)  based  on  less  stringent  criteria  than 
those  implemented  in  SERAPHIN.   The  applicant  also  argued  that  delay  in  "time  to  clinical 
worsening"  may  not  be  an  appropriate  reflection  of  the  SERAPHIN  data  and  may  not  be  an 
incentive to further improved drug development in PAH. The applicant then proposed a claim of 
“delay  in  progression  of  the  disease”,  arguing  that  primary  endpoint  in  SERAPHIN  measured 
progression of the disease. However, this proposal was rejected by the CHMP as this would imply 
that macitentan is a disease-modifying agent, whereas the main effect of ERAs is vasodilation. 
Finally,  the  applicant  proposed  a  new  wording  without  including  any  specific  claim  in  the 
indication but including a cross-reference to section 5.1. This proposal was deemed acceptable by 
the  CHMP,  and  should  be  interpreted  in  light  of  the  broader  body  of  evidence  with  macitentan 
from  SERAPHIN  in  comparison  with  other  PAH  studies  where  claims  have  been  limited  to  the 
6MWT and/or symptoms. However, as comparative studies are lacking, no final conclusions can 
be drawn on their relative benefit in patients with PAH. 
A total of 27 patients did not complete the study and therefore vital status was missing at EOS, 
i.e., lost to follow-up, etc.). Missing data were well balanced by treatment group. The results of 
the sensitivity analyses using the Best-case, Base-case and Worst-case scenarios were similar to 
that  of  the  primary  analysis  for  the time  to  death  up  to  EOS,  with  risk  reductions  ranging  from 
33% to 16% across all analyses (none of them statistically significant). The primary analysis risk 
reduction of 23% falls well within that range. 
The secondary endpoint of placebo-corrected median change in 6MWD from baseline to Month 6 
showed similar treatment effects versus placebo in the macitentan 3 mg (median 14.0 m, 97.5% 
CLs 2.0, 27.0 p=0.0122) and macitentan 10 mg groups (median 15.0 m, 97.5% CLs 2.0, 28.0, p 
=  0.0078).  The  p-value  for  improvement  in  6MWD  is  above  the  0.001  value  prefixed  in  the 
protocol to consider the results as conclusive. In addition, the clinical relevance of a 15 m median 
improvement  is  questionable.  Therefore,  it  is  agreed  the  Applicant’s  proposal  not  to  reflect  the 
improvement in exercise capacity in the indication. 
The composite of hospitalization or death due to PAH up to EOT + 7 days was reduced by 50% 
versus  placebo  with  macitentan  10  mg  [HR:  0.50  (97.5%  CLs  0.34,  0.75,  logrank  p<0.0001)], 
thus providing consistent support for a benefit of macitentan 10 mg versus placebo.  
Exploratory  results  in  WHO  FC,  Borg  dyspnoea  index,  Quality  of  life,  hospitalizations,  change 
versus  placebo  in  NT-pro-BNP  and  hemodynamics  were  consistent  with  those  of  the  primary 
endpoint.  
A  majority  of  patients  (approximately  64%)  of  patients  were  receiving  at  least  one  background 
PAH  therapy  at  baseline.  Sildenafil  was  the  most  common  PAH  therapy  and  was  taken  by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 69/105 
 
  
  
approximately 58% of patients across the groups and the effect of macitentan was consistent in 
patients with or without background PAH therapy at baseline. These data are considered robust 
enough to support the indication of the use of macitentan alone or as combination therapy on top 
of the standard of care.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical data available supports the efficacy of macitentan 10 mg OD in the long-term treatment 
of  PAH.  The  efficacy  has  been  shown  in  adult  patients  with  functional  class  II  and  III,  as 
monotherapy or in combination with other PAH therapies (PDE-5 inhibitors and prostanoids), in a 
PAH  population  with  idiopathic  and  heritable  PAH,  PAH  associated  with  connective  tissue 
disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  applicant  has  provided  data  of  several pooled  safety  datasets  comprising the  pivotal  study, 
the  Phase  2  studies,  data  from  the  phase  I  studies  and  data  from  the  Phase  3  trials  in  other 
indications  (essential  hypertension  and  IPF).  No  studies  with  an  active  comparator  have  been 
presented with this application. 
The  first  pool  (Pool  1)  includes  the  Phase  2/3  completed  controlled-trials  (AC-055-201,  AC-
055B201, and AC-055-302 SERAPHIN). Nevertheless, results of this pool will likely be driven by 
SERAPHIN  trial  that  recruited  more  than  700  patients.  The  second  pool  (Pool  2)  includes  the 
pivotal 
trial  (AC-055-302/SERAPHIN)  and 
its  ongoing  open-label  extension  (AC-055-
303/SERAPHIN  OL)  with  the  aim  of  providing  information  on  the  long-term  safety  profile  of 
macitentan. Only the SERAPHIN study and its open-label extension were conducted in the target 
population,  as  study  AC-055-201  was  performed  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension,  study 
AC-055B201  was  conducted  in  patients  with  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF)  and  clinical 
pharmacology studies were conducted in volunteers. 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  1299  patients  were  enrolled  in  phase  2  and  3  studies.  Of  them,  863  patients  were 
exposed to macitentan. 
The safety dataset size seems adequate for the PAH indication. 
Pool 1- Placebo-controlled trials (SERAPHIN PAH; MUSIC IPF; AC-055-201 in essential 
hypertension) 
Of  the  863  patients  exposed  to  any  dose  of  macitentan,  533  received  treatment  for  at  least  6 
months  (including  317  exposed  to  macitentan  10  mg);  447  patients  received  treatment  for  at 
least 12 months (including 258 exposed to macitentan 10 mg).

Pool 2 - PAH patients (SERAPHIN and SERAPHIN OL)  
675  patients  were  treated  with  macitentan  in  the  targeted  indication,  with  a  mean  exposure  of 
126 weeks (up to 202 weeks). Around 60% were exposed for 96 weeks or more, corresponding 
to 1321 patient-years exposure.  
Open-label extension trial  
Of the 550 patients exposed to 10 mg macitentan during the ongoing open-label extension trial 
in PAH indication, 164 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, and 127 patients have 
been  treated  for  at  least  12  months  (excluding  previous  exposure  time  during  the  double-blind 
phase). 
Table S-01. Overall exposure to macitentan in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies 
It is also important to highlight the additional exposure from the following 2 indications: 
Ischaemic digital ulcers associated with systemic sclerosis  
245 and 193 patients, respectively, were receiving double-blind study treatment with macitentan 
3  or  10  mg  or  placebo  in  the  ongoing  studies  AC-055C301  and  AC-055C302  in  patients  with 
ischaemic digital ulcers associated with systemic sclerosis. Up to the 29 March 2013 cut-off date, 
the duration of exposure to double-blind treatment was up to 63.7 weeks (median 24.1 weeks) 
and 59.3 weeks (median 22.7 weeks), respectively. 
Recurrent gliobastoma 
As  of  7  February  2013,  13  patients  were  enrolled  and  exposed  to  daily  macitentan  doses  of  30 
mg  up  to  120  mg  in  the  ongoing  study  in  recurrent  glioblastoma  (AC-055-115).  Maximum 
exposure to macitentan 30 mg was 391 days, to macitentan 60 mg was 59 days, to macitentan 
90 mg was 147 days and to macitentan 120 mg was 107 days. 
Adverse events 
In  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  macitentan  groups  was 
similar  to  that  in  the  placebo  group.  PAH  (i.e.,  worsening  of  PAH)  was  the  most  frequently 
reported  (30  %,  21  %  and  34.9  %  for  macitentan  3mg,  10mg  and  placebo).  Right  ventricular 
failure (14.8%, 13.2 % and 22.5 % for macitentan 3mg, 10mg and placebo), which is the most 
clinically  relevant  long-term  complication  of  PAH  was  also  reported  at  a  lower  incidence  in  the 
macitentan treatment groups than in the placebo group.

Other  AEs  reported  were:  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (20%,  15.3  %  and  13,3%  for 
macitentan  3mg,  10mg  and  placebo),  anaemia  (8.8  %,  13.2  %  and  3.2  %,  respectively), 
thrombocytopenia  (2.4  %,  5.0  %  and  2.8  %),  oedema  peripheral  (16%,  18.2  %  and  18,1%), 
hypotension (5.6% and 6.2%, and 4.4 %), headache (13.2% and 13.6%, 8.8%), insomnia (6.8 
%,  7.0 %  and 4.0%),  urinary  tract  infection (6.4%,  8.7 %  and  5.6 %),  gastroenteritis (4.8 %, 
3.3 % and 1, 2%), skin ulcers (2.8%, 3.3 % and 1.2%), abdominal pain (3.2 %, 2.9 % and 1,6 
%),  and  drug  hypersensitivity  (1.2%,  0.8  %  and  0%).  Around  95%  of  patients  of  the  pooled 
double-blind PAH population had at least one AE (96%, 94.6% and 96.4% for macitentan 3mg, 
10mg and placebo). Similar distribution of AEs was observed in other groups of patients. 
In the pool 1, the majority of patients experienced at least one AE (more than 80% in the three 
treatment  groups).  The  most  common  AEs  were  similar  to  double  blind  PAH  population.  These 
AEs  would  be  reflecting  disease  progression  in  the  placebo  group  (and  in  the  3mg  treatment 
group). In the pool 2, while the proportion of patients with any AEs increased from 63.3% at 0–6 
months  of  macitentan  exposure  to  75.2%  at  6–12  months  and  slightly  increased  up  to  30 
months  of  macitentan  exposure  (85.4%),  indicating  that  the  longer  the  exposure,  the  higher 
percentage of AEs. The percentage of patients with any SAE was constant (around 15-20%) over 
time. With respect to AEs, the incidence liver abnormalities, oedema and anaemia increased up

to  30  months  of  exposure  while  the  incidence  decreased  or  was  maintained  for  hypotension, 
renal  impairment,  respiratory  infections,  malignancies  or  MACE.  In  none  of  the  analyses  was 
there evidence of dose-response relationship. 
Hypotension:  In  the  double-blind  PAH  trial,  there  was  also  a  higher  incidence  of  hypotension 
relative  to  placebo  (6.0%,  7.0%  and  4.4%  for  macitentan  3  mg,  10  mg,  and  placebo, 
respectively).  However,  hypotension  as  an  SAE  was  reported  less  frequently  for  macitentan 
(0.4% and 0.8% for macitentan 3mg and 10mg) than for placebo (1.2%), and only 1 patient on 
macitentan 10 mg discontinued due to this AE. Hypotension cases were predominantly reported 
in  female  patients  and  there  was  no  indication  of  an  increased  incidence  in  other  potentially 
vulnerable  subgroups,  such  as  the  elderly.  Hypotension  cases  were  not  associated  to  a  higher 
incidence  of  dizziness  or  syncope  in  the  macitentan  group.  No  data  have  been  provided  for  the 
Pool 1 as it includes patients coming from the essential hypertension study. 
In  Pool  2,  the  incidence  of  hypotension  was  slightly  more  frequent  at  the  start  of  treatment 
(2.7%)  compared  to  patients  treated  longer  than  30  months  (0.7%).  In  the  IPF  population, 
similar  percentages  were  observed  for  macitentan  10mg  and  placebo  (5.9%  and  5.1% 
respectively). Incidence was also higher for the macitentan group when it was presented as per 
100 patient-years (5.4% versus 4.3% respectively). In the clinical pharmacology DDI study with 
macitentan  and  sildenafil,  a  decrease  in  systolic  pressure  by  a  maximum  of  8  mmHg  from  a 
baseline of 120mmHg was observed. 
Considering  that  patients  on  macitentan  are  likely  to  be  treated  concomitantly  with  sildenafil, 
cases  of  hypotension  (decrease  in  systolic  pressure  from  baseline  and  concomitant  symptoms 
like  dizziness  or  syncope)  were  reviewed.  After  review,  despite  the  fact  that  hypotension  does 
Assessment report

not seem particularly worrisome in PAH patients even in combination with other PAH therapy, it 
is considered a class effect of ERAs and data on hypotension from SERAPHIN have been included 
in section 4.8 of the Opsumit SmPC. 
Infections: The incidence of respiratory infection AEs in patients on macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg 
was  higher  than  in  placebo,  both  in  Pool  1  (36%,  33.1%  and  24.6%,  respectively)  and  in  the 
double-blind  PAH  population  (43.6%,  40.9%  and  28.5%).  Nevertheless,  the  majority  of 
respiratory infections occurred in the upper respiratory tract and few resulted in discontinuation 
of  the  study  (none  in pool  1  and  0.8%  in  macitentan  3mg  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population). 
The  applicant  states  that  this  higher  incidence  may  be  due  to  a  reporting  bias,  as  nasal 
congestion  symptoms  are  observed  in  relation  to  the  effect  of  vasodilation  of  the  drug  which 
seems  reasonable.  It  is  reassuring  that  when  incidence  is  adjusted  by  exposure  results  are 
similar for macitentan a placebo (23.1, 22.6 and 18.8 events per 100 patient-years for the two 
doses  of  macitentan  and  placebo)  for  Pool  1.  In  case  of  double-blind  PAH  population  similar 
results are found (22.8, 20.5 and 17.4 events/100 patient-years). Regarding Pool 2, around 20% 
of  patients  presented  respiratory  infections  over  the  treatment,  with  no  clear  exposure-time-
dependent pattern.

Other  infections:  In  the  double-blind  PAH  population  there  was  certain  a  imbalance  in  the 
incidence  of  AEs  of  urinary  tract  infections  and  gastroenteritis  in  patients  who  received 
macitentan  compared  to  those  who  received  placebo  (6.4%,  8.7%  and  5.7%  for  macitentan  3 
mg,  10  mg  and  placebo  respectively).  However,  such  infections  were  not  associated  with  an 
excess of SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation, or an increase in reporting rate over time. 
Oedemas: In the double-blind PAH population the incidence of oedemas was similar in the total 
macitentan  group  (20.9%)  and  the  placebo  group  (20.5%).  In  the  10  mg  group  the  incidence 
was marginally higher than in placebo. However, when adjusted on the basis of patients years of 
exposure,  the  incidence  in  the  macitentan  group  (11  events  /100  patients  years)  was  actually 
lower than in placebo (12. 5 events/100 patients years). Similar incidences of oedemas were also 
observed for macitentan and placebo in the Pool 1 population. 
Oedema as SAE in the Pool 1 was uncommon with macitentan treatment (0.6%, 0.7% and 1.1% 
for the macitentan groups and placebo) and no patients discontinued treatment due to this AE.  
In  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  the  incidence  of  peripheral  oedemas  was  higher  in  the 
elderly (30.3%, 25.9% and 18.2% for macitentan 3mg, 10mg and placebo) compared to adults 
(14.3%, 17.7% and 18.6%, respectively). Nevertheless in the Pool 1 a clearly higher incidence of 
oedema  was  not  seen  in  the  elderly  for  the  proposed  dose  (22.2%,  13.0%  and  9.1%  for 
macitentan  3mg  and  10mg  and  placebo)  compared to the  adult  population  (11.6%,  14.2%  and 
14.9%).  Higher  incidence  was  only  observed  with  the  lowest  dose  (3mg).  This  is  surprising 
considering that there is a known dose-dependent effect of ERAs.

For  the  Pool  2,  the  longer  periods  of  time  receiving  macitentan  were  associated  with  a  higher 
incidence  of  oedema  (from  8.9%  for  0-6  months  of  exposure  to  12%  for  patients  treated  for 
more than 30 months).  
A higher rate of oedema with macitentan 3 mg than with macitentan 10 mg was found in elderly 
patients. No relationship with diuretic use was found in a post-hoc analysis and therefore it might 
correspond to a chance finding.  
Data  on  oedema/fluid  retention  during  SERAPHIN  have  been  included  in  section  4.8  of  the 
Opsumit SmPC. 
Malignancies: In the double-blind PAH population lower incidence adjusted by exposure was seen 
in  the  macitentan  10  mg  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  In  addition,  there  was  no 
increase  over  time  in  the  reporting  rate  of  malignancies.  In  some  cases,  short  latency  or 
confounding factors such as medical history of malignancy were documented, and in a few cases 
malignancy  was  not  confirmed.  In  Pool  1  there  was  a  slight  excess  of  malignancies  in  patients 
treated with the macitentan 3 mg compared to placebo (1.7 versus 1.4 per patient/year). Similar 
figures  were  seen  for  patients  on  the  macitentan  10  mg  (1.8  per  patient/year).  The  small 
numbers do not allow drawing sound conclusions although malignancies have not been described 
as a safety concern with other ERAs.

Menstrual  disorders  and  ovarian  cyst:  In  the  double-blind  PAH  SERAPHIN  study,  an  imbalance 
was  recorded  in  the  reporting  of  menstrual  disorders  (6.9%  for  macitentan  3  mg,  5.1%  for  10 
mg and 1.1% in the placebo group). No consistent drug-exposure pattern could be identified as 
latency  varied  from  1  to  35  months.  There  were  confounding  factors  in  most  patients 
(concomitant  anticoagulants,  hormonal  contraception,  medical  history  or  concomitant  events). 
These events have not been described as AEs with other ERAs. The data available are insufficient 
to establish a causal relationship between macitentan and menstrual disorders or ovarian cysts. 
However, due to the numerical imbalance observed, menstrual disorders and ovarian cysts have 
been considered important potential risks for macitentan. 
Other  AEs:  The  most  frequently  reported  AE  for  macitentan  in  other  clinical  studies  was 
headache.  Other  AEs  were:  nasopharyngitis,  rhinitis,  hypotension;  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection  and  syncope,  dysmenorrhoea,  peripheral  oedema.  Those  are  in  line  with  the  AEs 
reported  in  PAH  studies.  No  deaths,  SAEs,  or  severe  intensity  AEs  were  reported  in  the 
macitentan-treated  healthy  subjects.  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  were 
reported in two studies. In the drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with ketoconazole, one subject 
discontinued study treatment due to AEs of increased AST, ALT, and gammaglutamyltransferase 
(GGT)  during  treatment  with  ketoconazole  (18  days)  and  13  days  after  a  single  dose  of 
macitentan 10 mg.  
IPF study: The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was 97.5% in the macitentan group 
and 98.3% in the placebo groups. Worsening of IPF was the most frequently reported AE (21.0% 
macitentan,  25.4%  placebo).  Dyspnea  (20.2%  macitentan,15.3%  placebo),  peripheral  oedema 
(11.8%  macitentan,  6.8%  placebo),  anaemia  (10.9%  macitentan  only),  pneumonia  (9.2% 
macitentan, 6.8% placebo) and nausea (7.6% macitentan, 3.4% placebo), occurred at a higher 
incidence  in  patients  on  macitentan  than  on  placebo.  The  incidences  of  cough  and  pulmonary 
hypertension were lower on macitentan (18.5% and 0.8%, respectively) than on placebo (35.6% 
and  5.1%,  respectively). The  majority  of  AEs  were of  mild or  moderate intensity.  Only  7 out of 
178 enrolled patients had pulmonary hypertension (PH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
reported  in  their  medical  history:  4  in  the  placebo  arm  and  3  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  group. 
None of these 7 patients had a fatal outcome. Considering the very low number of patients with 
PH/PAH  at  baseline,  no  meaningful,  comparative  analysis  could  be  conducted  based  on  the 
presence or absence of concomitant PH/PAH.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall  SAEs:  For  PAH  patients  a  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  was  observed  on  placebo  than  on 
macitentan (52%, 45% and 55% for macitentan 3 mg, 10 mg and placebo, respectively) (Table 
36).  The  most  frequent  were  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  right  ventricular  failure  both 
related to progression of the disease. In Pool 1, as expected, the percentage of patients reporting 
SAEs  was  higher  for  macitentan  3mg  (42.4%)  and  placebo  (42,  7%)  compared  to  macitentan 
10mg  (35.0%).  The  most  frequent  were  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  right  ventricular 
failure both related to progression of the disease. Pneumonia was reported as SAE in around 2% 
of patients in all treatment groups. Anaemia was more frequent in both macitentan groups (1.6% 
and 1.4%) than in placebo (0.3%).  
Assessment report

Page 77/105 
 
  
  
 
MACE:  The  overall  incidence  of  major  adverse  cardiovascular  events  (MACE)  was  comparable 
between  the  macitentan  and  placebo  groups.  Cardiovascular  deaths  were  less  frequent  in 
macitentan groups than in placebo (Table 91).  
Deaths:  
Deaths occurred in a similar percentage in patients on macitentan and placebo both in the double 
blind PAH study (8,8% for macitentan 3 mg, 6,6% for macitentan 10 mg and 8,4% for placebo) 
and in the pool 1 (7,1% for macitentan 3mg, 5,9% for macitentan 10mg and 6,8% for placebo) 
(Table  34).  Most  of  the  deaths  were  considered  as  related  to  underlying  condition  (progressing 
right heart or respiratory failure).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 78/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Two  deaths  were  considered  as  related  to  macitentan  treatment.  One  was  due  to  right 
ventricular failure associated to jaundice within the context of right ventricular failure progression 
(SERAPHIN study in PAH). The other was due to pulmonary embolism (MUSIC study in IPF). The 
2  deaths  are  unlikely  to  be  related  to  the  drug.  In  the  first  case  hepatic  enzyme  alterations 
increased  over  time  despite  the  drug  was  discontinued  and  the  patient  died  100  days  after 
withdrawal. In the second case, pulmonary thromboembolism is a common cause of death in IPF 
patients. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver abnormalities:  
Other  ERAs  have  shown  dose-dependent  LFT  abnormalities,  specifically  increases  in  serum 
aminotransferases  that  can  be  associated  to  hepatotoxicity.  The  mechanism  is  not  fully 
understood but is considered to be related in part to inhibition of bile acid export.  
In the SERAPHIN study, ALT and AST were measured at screening and at monthly intervals after 
initiation  of  study  treatment  until  at  least  28  days  after  the  EOT.  In  Pool  1  10.3%,  9%  and 
11.9%  in  the  macitentan  3mg,  10mg  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  had  liver  abnormalities 
compared  to  placebo.  A  higher  proportion  of  patients,  however,  discontinued  treatment  in  the 
macitentan  groups  (2.3%  and  2.6%)  versus  placebo  (1.1%).  Similarly  a  higher  incidence  was 
observed for the placebo group in the double-blind PAH population, but, again, the percentage of 
patients who discontinued was higher for the macitentan groups.  In addition, both in the Pool 1 
and  in  the  double-blind  PAH  populations,  more  SAEs  and  more  AEs  leading  to  discontinuations 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013

were  reported  in  patients  on  macitentan  than  on  placebo.  In  relation  to  the  clinically  relevant 
serum  aminotransferase  abnormalities  observed  both  in  the  Pool  1  and  double-blind  PAH 
populations, there does not seem to be relevant differences between the macitentan groups and 
placebo,  except  for  patients  with  AST  or  ALT  >  8xULN  where  higher  percentages  were  seen  for 
patients on macitentan in both safety populations.

Based  on  the  review  of  all  the  data,  the  ILSB  concluded  that  there  is  no  definite  hepatotoxicity 
signal from macitentan. However, as stated before, hepatotoxicity is a well-known AE associated 
to  ERAs.  While  a  lack  of  hepatotoxic  potential  is  not  excluded,  macitentan  should  be 
contraindicated  in  patients  with  baseline  values  of  transaminases  >  3xUL,  in  line  with  the 
exclusion criteria applied in the SERAPHIN trial after 5 cases of liver transaminases >3xULN were 
reported  in  the  dose-finding  study  in  mild-to-moderate  essential  hypertension  (AC-055-201), 
which led to the Sponsor's decision to end the dose-finding study earlier than planned. 
Nine  of  the  10  Hy's  law  cases  (ALT>3xULN  and  total  bilirubin  >2xULN)  were  reported  in  the 
double-blind PAH population (4 on macitentan 10 mg, 3 on macitentan 3 mg and 2 on placebo). 
In addition, 5 cases with ALT>8xULN and total bilirubin<2xULN were also identified. Most cases 
finally recovered but there were 5 cases in all with a result of death. Although in all cases there 
seems to be confounding factors and they could be related to worsening of PAH or IPF a cautious 
approach  seems  appropriate  including  monitoring  of  patients,  changes  in  the  SmPC  and  RMP 
measures. 
A post-hoc analysis of hepatic events has been conducted in patients at high risk (those who had 
a  history  of  liver disease at  screening)  (n=114).  The  analysis  does  show  an  increase  in  hepatic 
events  between  patients  at  high  risk  and  those  without  risk  factors,  but  without  differences 
between macitentan and placebo in both strata. Summarized information on hepatic events from 
ongoing or recently completed studies with macitentan (e.g. MUSIC IPF, ischaemic digital ulcers, 
glioblastoma) has been provided by the Applicant (cut-off date: 30 June 2013).  
The pattern of hepatic events (AEs related to hepatobiliary disorders as well as the incidence of 
liver test elevation) is different across indications. In the PAH population, the lower incidence of 
hepatic events in macitentan-treated  patients versus placebo is likely to be related to an efficacy 
of  macitentan  versus  placebo  in  preventing  right  sided  heart  failure  and  associated  hepatic 
congestion, which is the main cause of transaminase elevations in patients with PAH.  
The incidence of ALT and/or AST > 3xULN (3.4% in the SERAPHIN study in the 10 mg group with 
a  median  exposure  of  116  weeks)  is  well  within  the  range  observed  with  ambrisentan  (3.6% 
from Kaplan-Meier estimate at 1 year in 483 patients) and below that which had been observed 
with  bosentan  in  PAH  (11%-14%  at  the  target  dose  of  250  mg/day).  However,  there  are  no 
head-to-head clinical studies to conclude that macitentan provides an improved safety profile in 
comparison with other ERAs (i.e.: bosentan, ambrisentan).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013

Although no hepatic signal was observed in the SERAPHIN study in PAH, an imbalance in adverse 
hepatobiliary events was found in IPF and in patients with essential hypertension. In conclusion, 
with  the  data  available,  a  potential  association  between  macitentan  and  risk  of  liver  toxicity 
cannot be definitively ruled out. 
The SmPC information on liver safety with macitentan, regarding posology, contraindications and 
warnings,  has been revised and is aligned with the SmPC of ambrisentan, as  the hepatotoxicity 
risk seems similar. 
Renal  function:  No  clinical  data  is  available  for  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  In 
addition, patients administered macitentan 10 mg with mild to moderate renal impairment had a 
higher reported rate of anaemia and/or hypotension (Table 90.2), which has been included in the 
revised SPC.  
Table  90.2  AEs  related  to  renal  impairment,  categorised  by  baseline  renal  function 
status; number of patients with AEs (PAH double-blind population; AC-055-302) 
Anaemia  (AEs  and  laboratory  data):  Like  with  other  ERAs,  decrease  in  haemoglobin 
concentrations was a laboratory abnormality observed with macitentan that was associated to a 
dose-dependent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  anaemia  compared  to  placebo  (Figure  1).  In  the 
double-blind  PAH  population,  the  mean  maximum  reduction  from  baseline  in  haemoglobin  was 
0.73 g/dL in the macitentan 3 mg group (baseline 15.5 g/dL) and 1.1 g/dL in the macitentan 10 
mg  group  at  month  3  (baseline  15.6  g/dL).  This  effect  was  apparent  at  3  months  and  it  was 
stable  thereafter.  In  the  PAH  population,  haemoglobin  <  10  g/dL  was  recorded  in  5.8%  and 
8.7% of patients on macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg, respectively, compared with 3.4% on placebo. 
In most cases the decreases were associated to a medical history of anaemia or were reported in 
the  setting  of  concurrent  clinical  events  including,  in  some  cases,  bleeding.  Importantly,  the 
incidence  of  SAEs  of  anaemia  in  macitentan-treated  patients  was  relatively  low  (2.4  % 
macitentan  3  mg,  2.9  %  macitentan  10  mg)  and  it  was  the  cause  of  discontinuation  only  in  a 
single  patient  at  each  macitentan  dose.  Blood  transfusions  were  given  more  frequently  to 
patients treated with macitentan than to those treated with placebo. 
Assessment report

In general, these data indicate that macitentan exhibits a moderate, non progressive and dose-
related haemoglobin reduction. As for other ERA, the initiation of treatment is not recommended 
in patients with clinically significant anemia as stated in the proposed SmPC.  
Leukocyte  and  platelets  counts:  In  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  macitentan  was  associated 
with  modest and non dose-dependent decreases in mean leukocyte count from baseline to EOT 
(macitentan 3 mg: 0.9×109/mL, macitentan 10 mg: 0.7×109/mL, placebo: 0.0×109/mL) (Table 
94),  corresponding  to  a  9%  decrease  from  baseline  (7.5×109/mL)  with  the  10  mg  dose.  Two 
patients (2/218, 0.9%), both on macitentan 10 mg, had shifts from baseline to CTC grade 3 (1.0 
to < 2.0×109/L). No infections were observed in either of these patients. 
A  small  proportion  of  PAH  patients,  in  both  placebo  and  macitentan  groups,  showed  markedly 
reduced  platelet  counts  (to  <  50.0  ×  109/L),  with  or  without  bleeding  complications,  at  some 
time during the study. Resolution occurred during continued macitentan treatment and there was 
an absence of recurrence after treatment reinitiating.  
Coagulation tests: Macitentan prolonged the values of some coagulation tests (e.g.: prothrombin 
time) in preclinical studies.  
Bleeding  events:  There  is  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  bleeding  events  reported  in  the 
macitentan  groups  (19.6%  and  18.6%  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  and  10  mg  respectively) 
compared to placebo (14.5%). This was mainly driven by the higher incidence of gynaecological 
bleedings (6.9% and 5.1% in the macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg respectively) compared to placebo 
(1.1%).  Importantly,  there  is  no  dose  response  observed  in  all  these  reported  bleedings.  In 
general, concomitant administration of antithrombotics or PDE5 inhibitors was associated with a 
higher  bleeding  rate,  which  is  expected.  No  direct  causal  relationship  can  be  found  between 
macitentan  administration  and  the  increased  bleeding  events.  There  are  no  known  PK 
interactions between macitentan and warfarin or sildenafil. 
Vital signs 
Heart rate: No effect of macitentan on heart rate was apparent in the overall pooled double-blind 
safety set.

Table 68. Summary of adverse events displayed by age group (Pool 1) 
With respect to specific adverse events, in the elderly PAH-patient population (> 65 years), there 
was  a  higher  incidence  of  dyspnoea  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  group  (18.2%)  and  10  mg  group 
(14.8%) compared to the placebo group (11.4). Oedema AEs were reported at a higher incidence 
in elderly PAH patients treated with macitentan compared to placebo (there were no oedema AEs 
in adolescents). The incidences were 30.3%, 25.9% and 18.2% in the macitentan 10 mg, 3 mg 
and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  There  was  no  dose-dependency  and  in  a  logistic  regression 
analysis, no statistically significant interaction between age and treatment was observed.  
There was  no obvious effect of PAH disease severity at baseline (WHO FC  I/II vs  III/IV) on the 
pattern of AEs across the age groups.  
The pattern of AEs was generally similar for males and females both for Pool 1 and the double-
blind  PAH  population.  Evaluation  by  subgroup  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population  showed  that 
most  hypotension  AEs  were  reported in  female  patients.  In  the  macitentan  10  mg  group,  16 of 
the 17 patients with hypotension AEs were female (incidence of 8.2% vs 2.1% in males). The AE 
urinary tract infection was reported at a higher incidence in females than in males. 
Race/ethnicity  is  only  described  for  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  as  the  IPF  study  (AC-
055B201)  and  essential  hypertension  study  (AC-055-201)  comprised  almost  exclusively  White 
patients.  Subgroup  differences  on  the  basis  of  race/ethnicity  and  geographical  region  were 
unremarkable.  
The analysis of AEs for Pool 1 did not reveal any clear or consistent differences in the pattern of 
AEs  on  the  basis  of  no,  mild  or  moderate–severe  baseline  renal  impairment.  No  correlation 
between  the  severity  (mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  of  hepatic  impairment  and  the  mean  plasma 
exposure  to  macitentan  and  its  metabolites,  ACT-132577  and  ACT-373898,  was  apparent  in  a 
study  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment.  Other  than  infections  and  oedema,  subgroup 
differences on the basis of baseline PAH therapy were unremarkable.

Pregnancy and lactation  
In the clinical development program, there were a total of 7 pregnancies (5 on macitentan 3 mg 
and  2  on  placebo).  All  occurred  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population.  Of  the  5  patients  in  the 
macitentan 3 mg group, one had a therapeutic abortion, one had a spontaneous abortion. Both 
patients  subsequently  restarted  macitentan  treatment.  The  spontaneous  abortion  was  assessed 
by the investigator as unrelated to study treatment. One patient had an abortion scheduled, but 
died  due  to  worsening  of  PAH  before  the  scheduled  date.  For  the  other  2  macitentan-treated 
patients,  both  permanently  discontinued  treatment  and  continued  the  pregnancy.  Both  women 
gave  birth  prematurely.  In  one  case  the  baby  had  hyaline  membrane  disease  complicated  by 
sepsis, a grade 4 intracranial haemorrhages and poor skin condition. Three days after birth, the 
baby  died  from  persistent  hypotension,  due  to  extreme  prematurity.  No  obvious  dysmorphism 
was  noted  and  the  prenatal  screening  at  Week  18  had  shown  no  anomaly.  The  death  was 
reported  as  unrelated  to  study  treatment.  In  the  second  case,  the  baby  had  no  neonatal 
abnormalities  and  survived.  Both  placebo-treated  patients  had  therapeutic  abortions,  one  of 
whom  subsequently  restarted  study  treatment,  while  the  other  permanently  discontinued 
treatment.  It  is  not  known  whether  macitentan  is  excreted  into  human  breast  milk.  In  rats, 
macitentan  and  its  metabolites  were  excreted  into  milk  during  lactation.  Breast-feeding  is  not 
recommended during treatment with macitentan. 
Overdose  
There  is  no  experience  with  accidental  overdose  of  macitentan.  Single  doses  of  up  to  and 
including  600  mg  were  administered  in  healthy  subjects.  This  dose  was  associated  with 
headache,  nausea  and  vomiting.  In  the  case  of  overdose,  general  supportive  treatment  is 
recommended.  Considering  the  high  degree  of  protein  binding,  macitentan  is  not  likely  to  be 
removed by dialysis. 
Rebound effect 
Available  data  do  not  indicate  that  the  discontinuation  of  macitentan  10  mg  is  associated  with 
any AE suggestive of a rebound effect. 
Ability to drive and use machines  
No  studies  on  the  effect  of  macitentan  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines  have  been 
performed, as an effect is not anticipated. 
Potential for abuse  
There is no indication of any potential for abuse from clinical studies or from current knowledge 
of ERAs in general. 
Testicular safety:  see "pharmacodynamic" section. 
Immunological events 
All cases of hypersensitivity appear to be associated with concomitant medications and seasonal 
allergy, not with macitentan. Only one case was considered by the investigator to be related to 
treatment.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
See  “pharmacodynamics”  section  for  safety  related  to  drug-drug  interaction  with  sildenafil 
(increase in headache and hypotension). No other information is available. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Around  10%  of  patients  discontinued  due  to  AEs  both  in  the  pool  1  and  the  double  blind  PAH 
population.  Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  right  ventricular  failure,  both  related  to  the 
underlying  condition,  were  more  frequent  in  the  placebo  group  in  these  populations.    As 
expected,  anaemia  and  increase  in  aminotransferases  were  more  frequency  in  the  macitentan 
groups. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  applicant  has  provided  data  of  several pooled  safety  datasets  comprising the  pivotal  study, 
the  phase  II  studies,  data  from  the  phase  I  studies  data  from  the  phase  III  trials  in  other 
indications  (essential  Hypertension  and  IPF).  No  studies  with  an  active  comparator  have  been 
presented  with  this  application.  According  to  the  applicant,  675  patients  were  treated  with 
macitentan  in  the  targeted  indication,  with  a  mean  exposure  of  126  weeks  (up  to  202  weeks). 
Around 60% were exposed for 96 weeks or more, corresponding to 1321 patient-years exposure. 
The safety dataset size seems adequate for the PAH indication.  
There is clinical information on specific serious AE or serious AE that could represent an alert that 
have  been  identified  with  other  ERAs.  Therefore,  a  focus  was  done  on  hepatotoxicity, 
vasodilatation, decrease in haemoglobin and teratogenicity among others. 
Adverse events:  
Overall AEs: 
Double-blind PAH population (SERAPHIN study):  
The overall incidence of AEs in the macitentan groups was similar to that in the placebo group. 
PAH (i.e., worsening of PAH) was the most frequently reported.  
Right ventricular failure, which is the most clinically relevant long-term complication of PAH was 
also reported at a lower incidence in the macitentan treatment groups than in the placebo group.  
Other AEs reported were: upper respiratory tract infection, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, oedema 
peripheral, hypotension, headache, insomnia, urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, skin ulcers, 
abdominal pain and drug hypersensitivity.  
Around 95% of patients of the pooled double-blind PAH population had at least one AE.  Similar 
distribution of AEs was observed in other groups of patients. 
In the pool 1, the majority of patients experienced at least one AE (more than 80% in the three 
treatment  groups).  The  most  common  AEs  were  similar  to  double  blind  PAH  population.  These 
Assessment report

AEs  would  be  reflecting  disease  progression  in  the  placebo  group  (and  in  the  3mg  treatment 
group). 
In  the  pool  2,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  any  AEs  increased  from  63.3%  at  0–6  months  of 
macitentan  exposure  to  75.2%  at  6–12  months  and  slightly  increased  up  to  30  months  of 
macitentan exposure (85.4%), indicating that the longer exposure the higher percentage of AEs. 
The percentage of patients with any SAE was quite constant (around 15-20%) over time.  
With respect to AEs, the incidence liver abnormalities, oedema and anaemia increased up to 30 
months  of  exposure  while  the  incidence  decreased  or  was  maintained  for  hypotension,  renal 
impairment, respiratory infections, malignancies or MACE. 
A dose-response relationship was found for anaemia but not for other AEs. 
In summary, the applicant has analysed some safety topics considered of special interest based 
on the experience with other ERAs, the nonclinical safety data, and findings in the studies. These 
topics  refer  to  AEs  and  laboratory  findings  denoting  hypotension,  respiratory  and  other 
infections,  oedema/fluid  retention,  liver  abnormalities,  anaemia/haemoglobin  decrease,  renal 
impairment,  malignant  neoplasms,  menstrual  disorders  and  ovarian  cysts  myocardial  infarction 
and cerebrovascular events, as well as effects of macitentan on QTc and other ECG variables. 
Hypotension:  
Double-blind PAH population (SERAPHIN study): 
There was a higher incidence of hypotension relative to placebo for macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg. 
Hypotension  cases  were  not  associated  to  a  higher  incidence  of  dizziness  or  syncope  in  the 
macitentan group.  
Despite hypotension does not seem particularly worrisome in PAH patients it is considered a class 
effect of ERAs and data on hypotension from SERAPHIN has been reflected in section 4.8 of the 
Opsumit SmPC.  
Infections:  
Respiratory infections:  
The incidence of respiratory infection AEs in patients on macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg was higher 
than  in  placebo,  both  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population  and  in  Pool  1.  Nevertheless,  the 
majority  of  respiratory  infections  occurred  in  the  upper  respiratory  tract  and  few  resulted  in 
discontinuation  of  the  study.  The  applicant  states  that  this  higher  incidence  may  be  due  to  a 
reporting bias, as nasal congestion symptoms are observed in relation to the effect of vasodilator 
of the drug which seems reasonable. 
It is reassuring that when incidence is adjusted by exposure results are similar for macitentan a 
placebo for the two doses of macitentan and placebo for the Pool 1. In case of double-blind PAH 
population  also  similar  results  are  found.  Regarding  Pool  2,  around  20%  of  patients  presented 
respiratory  infections  over  the  treatment,  with  no  clear  exposure  time-dependent  pattern.  In 
conclusion,  nasopharyngitis,  bronchitis  pharyngitis  have  been  included  in  section  4.8  of  the 
SmPC.

EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 87/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Other infections:  
In the double-blind PAH population there was certain imbalance in the incidence of AEs of urinary 
tract  infections  and  gastroenteritis  in  patients  who  received  macitentan  compared  to  those  who 
received  placebo.  However,  such  infections  were  not  associated  with  an  excess  of  SAEs  or  AEs 
leading  to  discontinuation,  or  an  increase  in  reporting  rate  over  time.  The  information  is 
appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Oedemas: 
In the double-blind PAH population, the incidence of oedemas was similar in the total macitentan 
group  and  the  placebo  group.  In  the  10  mg  group  the  incidence  was  marginally  higher  than  in 
placebo. However, when adjusted on the basis of patient years of exposure, the incidence in the 
macitentan group was actually lower than in placebo.   
Similar  incidences  of  oedemas  were  observed  also  for  macitentan  and  placebo  in  the  Pool  1 
population.  In  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  the  incidence  of  peripheral  oedemas  was  more 
common in the elderly compared to adults. Nevertheless in the Pool 1 a clearly higher incidence 
of oedema was not seen in the elderly for the proposed dose compared to the adult population.  
A higher rate of oedema with macitentan 3 mg than with macitentan 10 mg was found in elderly 
patients. No relationship with diuretic use was found in a post-hoc analysis and therefore it might 
correspond to a chance finding. 
In  conclusion,  a  specific  description  on  oedema/fluid  retention  during  SERAPHIN  has  been 
included in section 4.8 of the Opsumit SmPC. 
Malignancies: 
In  the  double-blind  PAH  population  lower  incidence  adjusted  by  exposure  was  seen  in  the 
macitentan 10 mg group compared to the placebo group. In addition, there was no increase over 
time  in  the  reporting  rate  of  malignancies.  In  the  Pool  1  there  was  a  slight  excess  of 
malignancies in patients treated with the macitentan 3 mg compared to placebo. Similar figures 
were seen for patients on the macitentan 10 mg.  
In conclusion, the small numbers do not allow drawing sound conclusions although malignancies 
have  not  been  described  as  a  safety  concern  with  other  ERAs.  Therefore,  no  information  is 
included in the SmPC. 
Menstrual disorders and ovarian cyst:  
In the double-blind PAH SERAPHIN study, an imbalance was recorded in the reported menstrual 
disorders  and  there  were  confounding  factors  in  most  patients.  These  events  have  not  been 
described as AEs with other ERAs.  
At  present,  the  data  available  are  insufficient  to  establish  a  causal  relationship  between 
macitentan and menstrual disorders or ovarian cysts. However, due to the numerical imbalance 
observed, menstrual disorders and ovarian cysts have been considered important potential risks 
for macitentan. 
Other AEs:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 88/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported AE for macitentan in other clinical studies was headache. Other AEs 
were:  nasopharyngitis,  rhinitis,  hypotension;  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  syncope 
dysmenorrhoea, peripheral oedema. Those are in line with the AEs reported in PAH studies.  
IPF study:  
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was 97.5% in the macitentan group and 98.3% 
in  the  placebo  groups.  Worsening  of  IPF  was  the  most  frequently  reported  AE.  Dyspnea, 
peripheral edema, anemia, pneumonia and nausea, occurred at a higher incidence in patients on 
macitentan than on placebo.  
The incidences of cough and pulmonary hypertension were lower on macitentan than on placebo. 
The  majority  of  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity  on  placebo.  Only  7  out  of  178  enrolled 
patients had pulmonary hypertension (PH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) reported in 
their  medical  history.  None  of  these  7  patients  had  a  fatal  outcome.  Considering  the  very  low 
number  of  patients  with  PH/PAH  at  baseline,  no  meaningful,  comparative  analysis  could  be 
conducted based on the presence or absence of concomitant PH/PAH.  
SAEs: 
For  PAH  patients  a  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  was  observed  for  macitentan  3  mg,  10  mg  and 
placebo,  respectively  PAH  and  right  ventricular  failure  both  related  to  progression  of  the 
diseases.  In  Pool  1,  as  expected,  the  percentage  of  patients  reporting  SAEs  was  higher  for 
macitentan 3mg and placebo compared to macitentan 10mg. The most frequent were pulmonary 
arterial  hypertension  and  right  ventricular  failure  both  related  to  progression  of  the  disease. 
Pneumonia was also reported as SAE in around 2% of patients in all treatment groups. Anaemia 
was more frequent in both macitentan groups than in placebo.  
MACE:  The  overall  incidence  of  major  adverse  cardiovascular  events  (MACE)  was  comparable 
between  the  macitentan  and  placebo  groups.  However,  the  incidence  of  cerebrovascular  events 
was  a  bit  higher  in  patients  on  both  macitentan  groups  versus  placebo.  On  the  other  hand, 
cardiovascular deaths were less frequent in macitentan groups than in placebo.  
Deaths:  
Deaths occurred in a similar percentage in patients on macitentan and placebo both in the double 
blind  PAH  study  and  in  the  pool  1.  Most  of  deaths  were  considered  as  related  to  underlying 
condition (progressing right heart or respiratory failure). Two deaths were considered as related 
to  macitentan  treatment,  one  was  due  to  right  ventricular  failure  associated  to  jaundice  within 
the  context  of  right  ventricular  failure  progression  in  a  PAH  study.  The  other  was  due  to 
pulmonary embolism in an IPF patient. However, they are unlikely to be related to the drug.  
Laboratory findings: 
Liver abnormalities (AEs and laboratory data):  
Other  ERAs  have  shown  dose-dependent  liver  abnormalities,  specifically  increases  in  serum 
aminotransferases  that  can  be  associated  to  hepatotoxicity.  The  mechanism  for  this  is  not  fully 
understood but is considered to be related in part to inhibition of bile acid export.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 89/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In  the  double-blind  PAH  safety  population  the  incidence  of  liver  abnormality  AEs  was  10.8%  in 
the total macitentan group and 16.1% in the placebo group.  
The incidences in the macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg groups were 12.0% and 9.5%, respectively, 
indicating  a  dose-related  reduction.  The  AE  incidence  findings  are  supported by  laboratory  data 
indicating liver abnormalities compared to placebo.  
In relation to clinically relevant serum aminotransferase abnormalities observed both in the Pool 
1 and double-blind PAH populations, no relevant differences between the macitentan groups and 
placebo were observed, except for patients with AST or ALT > 8xULN where higher percentages 
were seen for patients on macitentan in both safety populations.  
A post-hoc analysis of hepatic events does show an increase in hepatic events between patients 
at  high  risk  and  those  without  risk  factors,  but  without  differences  between  macitentan  and 
placebo in both strata.  
The pattern of hepatic events is different across indications.  
In  the  PAH  population,  the  lower  incidence  of  hepatic  events  in  macitentan-treated  patients 
versus  placebo  is  likely  to  be  related  to  a  better  efficacy  of  macitentan  versus  placebo  in 
preventing right sided heart failure and associated hepatic congestion, which is the main cause of 
transaminase elevations in patients with PAH.  The incidence of ALT and/or AST > 3xULN (3.4% 
in the SERAPHIN study in the 10 mg group with a median exposure of 116 weeks) is well within 
the  range  observed  with  ambrisentan  (3.6%  from  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  at  1  year  in  483 
patients) and below that which had been observed with bosentan in PAH (11%-14% at the target 
dose  of  250  mg/day).  However,  there  are  no  head-to-head  clinical  studies  to  conclude  that 
macitentan  provides  an  improved  safety  profile  in  comparison  with  other  ERAs  (i.e.:  bosentan, 
ambrisentan).  Although  no  hepatic  signal  was  observed  in  the  SERAPHIN  study  in  PAH,  an 
imbalance  in  hepatobiliary  adverse  events  was  found  in  IPF  and  in  patients  with  essential 
hypertension. In conclusion, with the data available, a potential association between macitentan 
and risk of liver toxicity cannot be definitely ruled out. 
While  a  lack  of  hepatotoxic  potential  is  not  excluded,  macitentan  should  be  contraindicated  in 
patients  with  baseline  values  of  transaminases  >  3xULN  and  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment.  
Although in all cases confounding factors can be identified related to worsening of PAH or IPF, a 
cautious  approach  is  considered  appropriate  including  monitoring  of  patients,  appropriate 
measures and warnings in the SmPC. In the RMP , appropriate risk minimisation measures have 
been put in place. (patient card, HCP prescriber kit..) 
Renal function:  
No  clinical  data  is  available  for  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  In  addition,  patients 
administered  macitentan  10  mg  with  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment  had  a  higher  reported 
rate of anaemia and/or hypotension> This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Anaemia (AEs and laboratory data):  
Like  with  other  ERAS,  decrease  in  haemoglobin  concentrations  was  a  laboratory  abnormality 
observed with macitentan that was associated to a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of 
anaemia  compared  to  placebo.  In  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  the  mean  maximum 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 90/105 
 
  
  
  
reduction  from  baseline  in  haemoglobin  was  0.73  g/dL  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  group  and  1.1 
g/dL in the macitentan 10 mg group at month 3.  
In  the  PAH  population,  haemoglobin  <  10  g/dL  was  recorded  in  5.8%  and  8.7%  of  patients  on 
macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg, respectively, compared with 3.4% on placebo.  
In general, these data indicate that macitentan exhibits a moderate, non progressive and dose-
related haemoglobin reduction.  
As for other drugs of the same group, the initiation of treatment is not recommended in patients 
with clinically significant anemia as stated in the SmPC. In addition the applicant provided further 
information  discussing  the  appropriateness  of  making  dose  reduction  recommendations  in  the 
event  of  reductions  in  haemoglobin or  hematocrit. After  review of  the  available  data, the  CHMP 
considered that no dose reduction is required. 
Leukocyte counts: 
In  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  macitentan  was  associated  with  modest  and  non  dose-
dependent  decreases  in  mean  leukocyte  count  from  baseline  to  EOT,  corresponding  to  a  9% 
decrease  from  baseline  with  the  10  mg  dose.  No  infections  were  observed  in  either  of  these 
patients. 
Platelet counts:  
A  small  proportion  of  PAH  patients,  in  both  placebo  and  macitentan  groups,  showed  markedly 
reduced  platelet  counts,  with  or  without  bleeding  complications  during  the  study.  Resolution 
occurred  during  continued  macitentan  treatment  and  there  was  an  absence  of  recurrence  after 
treatment re-initiation.  
Bleeding events:  
There  is  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  bleeding  events  reported  in  the  macitentan  groups 
compared to placebo. This was mainly driven by the higher incidence of gynaecological bleedings 
compared  to  placebo.  In  general,  concomitant  administration  of  antithrombotics  or  PDE5 
inhibitors  was  associated  with  a  higher  bleeding  rate,  which  is  expected.  No  direct  causal 
relationship  can  be  found  between  macitentan  administration  and  the  increased  occurrence  of 
bleeding  events.  There  are  no  known  PK  interactions  between  macitentan  and  warfarin  or 
sildenafil. 
Vital signs: 
No effect of macitentan on heart rate was apparent in the overall pooled double-blind safety set.

Safety in special populations: 
Intrinsic factors: 
In the elderly PAH-patient population (> 65 years), there was a higher incidence of dyspnoea in 
the macitentan 3 mg group and 10 mg group compared to the placebo group, respect the rest of 
populations.  
Oedema AEs were reported at a higher incidence in elderly PAH patients treated with macitentan 
compared  to  placebo.  There  was  no  dose-dependency  and  no  statistically  significant  interaction 
between age and treatment was observed. There was no obvious effect of PAH disease severity 
at baseline (WHO FC I/II vs III/IV) on the pattern of AEs across the age groups.  
The pattern of AEs was generally similar for males and females both for Pool 1 and the double-
blind PAH population.  
Evaluation  by  subgroup  in  the  double-blind  PAH  population  showed  that  most  hypotension  AEs 
were  reported  in  female  patients.  The  AE  urinary  tract  infection  was  reported  at  a  higher 
incidence in females than in males. 
Race/ethnicity  is  only  described  for  the  double-blind  PAH  population,  as  the  IPF  study  (AC-
055B201)  and  essential  hypertension  study  (AC-055-201)  comprised  almost  exclusively 
Caucasian patients.  
Subgroup differences on the basis of race/ethnicity and geographical region were unremarkable  
Pregnancy and lactation:  
In the clinical development program, there were a total of 7 pregnancies all in the double-blind 
PAH population. Based on review of the cases, no specific conclusion can be drawn in relation to 
macitentan. 
In  view  of  the  teratogenicity  observed  in  non-clinical  studies,  macitentan  is  contraindicated 
during  pregnancy.  Furthermore,  if  appropriate,  the  need  for  reliable  contraception  and  monthly 
pregnancy  tests  during  treatment  is  mentioned  in  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  with  corresponding 
warnings in section 4.4. 
It  is  not  known  whether  macitentan  is  excreted  into  human  breast  milk.  However,  in  rats, 
macitentan and its metabolites were excreted into milk during lactation. Thus, breast-feeding is 
not recommended during treatment with macitentan. 
Overdose:  
There is no experience with accidental overdose of macitentan. In the case of overdose, general 
supportive  treatment  is  recommended.  Considering  the  high  degree  of  protein  binding, 
macitentan is not likely to be removed by dialysis. 
Rebound effect:  
The  results  did  not  indicate  that  the  discontinuation  of  macitentan  10  mg  was  associated  with 
any AE suggestive of a rebound effect. 
Ability to drive and use machines: 
No  studies  on  the  effect  of  macitentan  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines  have  been 
performed, as an effect is not anticipated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013 
Page 92/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
There is no indication of any potential for abuse from clinical studies or from current knowledge 
of ERAs in general. 
Hypersensitivity:  
All  of  the  cases  of  hypersensitivity  appear  to  be  associated  with  concomitant  medications  and 
seasonal  allergy,  not  with  macitentan.  Only  one  case  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
related to treatment. 
Discontinuation to AEs:  
Around  10  %  of  patients  discontinued  due  to  AEs  both  in  the  pool  1  and  the  double  blind  PAH 
population.  Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  right  ventricular  failure,  both  related  to  the 
underlying  condition,  were  more  frequent  in  the  placebo  group  in  these  populations.    As 
expected,  anaemia  and  increase  in  aminotransferases  were  more  frequency  in  the  macitentan 
groups. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  macitentan  seems  to  have  a  safety  profile  similar  to  that  of  other  ERAs.  The  adverse 
events  most  frequently  reported  were  right  heart  failure,  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (both 
in  principle  related  to  the  underlying  condition),  oedemas,  upper  tract  infection,  anaemia  and 
liver abnormalities.  
Although  there  are  no  major  safety  concerns  related  to  macitentan,  a  potential  association 
between  macitentan  and  risk  of  liver  toxicity  cannot  be  definitively  ruled  out.  The  SmPC  of 
Opsumit has been aligned with that of ambrisentan regarding hepatic safety (contraindication in 
patients  at  risk,  and  recommendation  for  regular  monitoring),  as  the  hepatotoxicity  risk  seems 
comparable. In addition, in view of the teratogenicity observed in non-clinical studies, macitentan 
is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy.  Furthermore,  the  need  for  reliable  contraception  and 
monthly  pregnancy  tests  during  treatment  is  reflected  in  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  with 
corresponding warnings in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
4.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
This application is based on the results of a single, long-term, double-blind pivotal Phase 3 study, 
AC-055-302/SERAPHIN.  The  pivotal  study  included  a  clinically  relevant  primary  endpoint  (the 
time  to  first  morbidity-mortality  event).  The  secondary  endpoints  (change  in  6MWD,  separate 
components  of  the  primary  endpoint,  change  in  WHO  FC,  haemodynamic  endpoints,  dyspnoea 
symptoms, NT-pro-BNP levels and QoL endpoints) were considered exploratory and appropriate. 
The tested doses (3 mg and 10 mg) were well justified on the basis of PD data and the median

SERAPHIN is the largest study conducted to date in PAH (n=742) and included a wide population 
of PAH patients with different aetiologies, Function Class and background medications. One of the

positive contribution of the current application is that it addresses combination therapy, which is 
an unmet need in PAH.  
The  primary  endpoint  analysis  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  effect  of  macitentan  10  mg  to 
reduce the risk of occurrence of the primary endpoint in the study population, which was below 
the pre-specified significance criteria (p<0.001) for a “conclusive study” [HR: 0.547 (97.5% CLs 
0.392,  0.762,  logrank  p  <  0.0001].  The  treatment  effect  with  macitentan  on  the  primary 
endpoint  was  established  early  and  was  sustained  during  treatment  (median  duration  of  more 
than 2 years).The 10mg dose was considered the appropriate dose on the basis of efficacy and 
safety results. For the 10  mg dose the treatment effect corresponded to an overall relative risk 
reduction of  45%  and  a  number-needed-to-treat  (NNT)  of  6  patients  (95%  CLs  4.48,  10.80)  to 
avoid  one  event  at  2  years.  Results  of  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoint  were 
consistent  with  those  of  the  main  analysis.  In  a  reanalysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  using  the 
components recommended in the PAH guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008), the HR versus 
placebo  for  the  occurrence  of  a  CHMP-defined  event  in  the  macitentan  10  mg  dose  group  was 
0.550 (97.5%CI: 0.417, 0.725; logrank p<0.0001). In the macitentan 3 mg group, the HR was 
0.737  (97.5%  CI:  0.568,  0.956;  p=0.0083).  The  corresponding  relative  risk  reductions  versus 
placebo  were  45%  and  26%,  respectively,  which  are  broadly  similar  to  the  results  of  the  main 
analysis.  In  addition,  the  effect  of  macitentan  10  mg  on  the  primary  outcome  was  generally 
consistent across subgroup analyses. At baseline, the majority (approximately 64%) of patients 
were  receiving  at  least  one  background  PAH  therapy.  Sildenafil  was  the  most  common  PAH 
therapy  and  was  taken  by  approximately  58%  of  patients  across  the  groups.  Macitentan 
administered  on  top  of  sildenafil  or  inhaled  prostanoids  showed  benefits,  with  minimal  PK 
interactions.  
The  majority  of  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  (e.g.:  the  composite  of  hospitalization  or 
death  due  to  PAH,  deaths  related  to  PAH,  all  cause  death,  improvement  in  WHO  FC,  Borg 
dyspnoea  index,  Quality  of  life,  reduced  hospitalizations,  change  versus  placebo  in  NT-pro-BNP 
and  hemodynamic  parameters),  provided  consistent  support  for  a  benefit  of  macitentan  10  mg 
versus placebo.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Not all the components of the chosen primary composite in SERAPHIN are equally robust. In the 
main  analysis,  the  rate  of  death  was  comparable  between  the  placebo  (6.8%)  and  the 
macitentan 10 mg arms (6.6%), while there is a numerical increase in the reported deaths in the 
macitentan  3  mg  arm  (8.4%)  compared  to  the  other  2  arms.  In  addition,  no  robust  statistical 
effect was found in the time to death analyses. Although the mortality results for macitentan 10 
mg are not inconsistent with those of the main composite endpoint, the point estimate tends to 
be  of  a  lesser  magnitude  than  that  of  the  composite  endpoint  (mainly  driven  by  worsening  of 
PAH),  and  statistical  significance  is  not  achieved  for  mortality.  In  addition,  beyond  statistical 
significance,  the  conclusions  about  a  benefit  in  survival  with  the  10  mg  dose  were  based  on  a 
limited  number  of  deaths  within  a  single  pivotal  trial.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  PAH 
Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008): “Specific claims on mortality can only be supported 
by long-term controlled studies including death as a primary endpoint”. A mortality claim cannot 
be  included  in  section  4.1  due  to  the  above-mentioned  reasons.  A  description  of  the  effect 
observed on deaths in section 5.1 of the SmPC is considered sufficient.  
Assessment report

The  most  frequent  first-reported  component  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  all  groups  was  ‘other 
worsening of PAH’ (28.8% macitentan 3 mg, 24.4% macitentan 10 mg, 37.2% placebo), driving 
the  positive  results  of  the  study.  This  implies  that  the  main  benefit  was  in  delaying  clinical 
worsening events (worsening of PAH). 
During the procedure, the applicant proposed a new wording without including any specific claim 
in  the  indication  but  including  a  cross-reference  to  section  5.1.  This  proposal  was  deemed 
acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  and  should  be  interpreted  in  light  of  the  more  robust  evidence  with 
macitentan  from  SERAPHIN  regarding  delay  in  clinical  worsening  of  PAH  in  comparison  to  other 
PAH  therapies  where  claims  have  been  limited  to  the  change  in  6MWT  and/or  symptoms. 
However, as comparative studies are lacking, no final conclusions can be drawn on their relative 
benefit in patients with PAH. 
With respect to missing data, a total of 27 patients did not complete the study and therefore vital 
status was missing at EOS, i.e., lost to follow-up, etc.). Additional data provided by the Company 
shows that missing data were well balanced by treatment groups. In addition, the results of the 
sensitivity analyses using the Best-case, Base-case and Worst-case scenarios were similar to that 
of the primary analysis for the time to death up to EOS, with risk reductions ranging from 33% 
to  16%  across  all  analyses  (none  of  them  statistically  significant).  The  primary  analysis  risk 
reduction of 23% falls well within that range.  
Some  subpopulations  were  under-represented  in  the  pivotal  study.  Almost  all  patients  were  in 
WHO  FC  II-III,  while  only  1  patient  was  in  FC  I  and  only  14  patients  were  in  FC  IV.  Therefore, 
the  indication  has  been  restricted  to  patients  on  FC  II  and  III.  Idiopathic  PAH  was  the  most 
common  aetiology  (55%)  followed  by  PAH  due  to  connective  tissue  (30%)  and  PAH  due  to 
congenital  shunts  (8%).  This  latter  subpopulation  only  included  PAH  associated  to  corrected 
simple  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts,  since  patients  with  PAH  associated  with  non-
corrected simple congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and combined and complex systemic-
to-pulmonary  shunts  were  excluded.  Therefore,  “PAH  due  to  congenital  shunts”  has  not  been 
included in the approved indication.  
Regarding paediatric population (12-18), their actual representation in the clinical study and the 
scarce  efficacy  and  safety  data  available  does  not  support  a  recommendation  of  use  for 
macitentan  in  children.  Therefore,  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Opsumit  in  children  have  not  yet 
been  established,  as  included  in  the  product  information.  Further  data  is  awaited  upon 
completion of planned studies in paediatric patients. 
Only about 20 patients were in the age range between 75-84 years in the pivotal trial. Therefore, 
macitentan should be used with caution in that population, as included in the product information 
The  p-value  for  improvement  in  6MWD  (one  of  the  secondary  outcomes)  was  above  the  0.001 
value  predefined  in  the  protocol  to  consider  the  results  as  conclusive.  In  addition,  the  clinical 
relevance  of  the  15  m  median  improvement obtained  with  macitentan  10  mg  versus  placebo  is 
questionable.  Therefore,  the  Applicant’s  proposal  of  not  including  the  improvement  in  exercise 
capacity  in  the  indication  is  endorsed.  Results  of  the  6MWT  showed  no  difference  between 
treatment  naïve  patients  and  patients  administered  macitentan  in  combination  with  other  PAH 
therapies  (median=13  m;  95%CI:  -5  to  31  and  median  =15  m;  95%CI:  2  to  30).  No  plausible 
explanation is available at present.  
Assessment report

Results  showed  some  improvement  in  PVR  and  CI  with  dose  response  in  treatment  naïve 
patients, but not in patients already on PAH-specific therapies. Within SERAPHIN, higher baseline 
NT-proBNP  levels  and  higher  absolute  values  at  Month  6  were  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of 
morbidity  and  mortality,  however  no  prognostic  value  of  change  from  baseline  was  observed. 
Finally, no head-to-head comparisons are available with other ERAs. Therefore, it is unknown if 
macitentan would provide some benefit in efficacy compared with bosentan or ambrisentan. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall,  macitentan  seems  to  have  a  safety  profile  similar  to  that  of  other  ERAs.  The  adverse 
events  most  frequently  reported  were  right  heart  failure,  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (both 
in  principle  related  to  the  underlying  condition),  liver  abnormalities,  anaemia,  oedemas  and 
upper tract infection. 
Elevations  of  liver  aminotransferases  (AST,  ALT)  have  been  associated  with  the  treatment  with 
ERAs,  including  macitentan.  This  toxic  effect  on  the  liver  seems  to  be  time-dependent,  with 
higher incidence with longer exposition to macitentan. In relation to the clinically relevant serum 
aminotransferase  abnormalities  observed  the  safety  pool,  there  does  not  seem  to  be  relevant 
differences between  macitentan and placebo in elevated aminotransferases >3×ULN (3.2% vs. 
3.9%)  or  Hy’s  law  cases  (1.2%  vs.  1.4%),  but  the  rate  of  AST/ALT  elevations  >8xULN  where 
higher in patients on macitentan versus placebo (1,3% vs 0,6%). In addition, the phase II study 
in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension was ended earlier than planned after 5 cases of liver 
transaminases >3xULN were reported (study AC-055-201).  
Because  a  lack  of  hepatotoxic  potential  cannot  be  excluded,  Opsumit  is  not  to  be  initiated  in 
patients with elevated aminotransferases (>3×ULN) at baseline or in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment, in line with the exclusion criteria applied in the SERAPHIN study. Liver enzyme tests 
should  be  obtained  prior  to  initiation  of  Opsumit.  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  signs  of 
hepatic injury and monthly monitoring of ALT and AST is recommended. 
As  with  other  ERAs,  treatment  with  macitentan  has  been  associated  with  a  decrease  in 
haemoglobin  concentration,  including  some  cases  that  may  blood  cell  transfusion.  Therefore, 
Opsumit  is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  severe  anaemia  and  haemoglobin  concentrations 
should  be  measured  prior  to  initiation  of  treatment  and  tests  repeated  during  treatment  as 
clinically indicated.  
Hypotension  is  considered  a  class  effect  of  ERAs  and  some  SmPC  amendments,  in  particular  in 
patient at risk of hypotension (e.g.: elderly, renal insufficiency, concomitant treatment with other 
vasodilators, may be necessary.  
Although  the  product  has  a  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions,  some  of  them  (PK 
interactions with strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4 and PD interactions with vasodilators) may 
be of clinical relevance. 
Macitentan was teratogenic in animal studies and therefore it is contraindicated during pregnancy 
and in women of child-bearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. There is a need 
for  reliable  contraception  and  monthly  pregnancy  tests  during  treatment.  The  contraindication 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457699/2013

has been extended to breastfeeding, as there is preclinical evidence of excretion into milk during 
lactation and a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
These unfavourable effects may be manageable in standard clinical practise.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  incidence of  oedemas  seems to  be  lower  with the  high  macitentan dose  (10  mg)  than  with 
the low macitentan dose in the elderly as compared to the adult population.   
A  causal  relationship  between  macitentan  and  menstrual  disorders  or  ovarian  cyst  is  difficult  to 
establish at the present time due to the overall low incidence of events, the confounding factors 
identified  in  patients  with  an  event,  and  also  due  to  the  absence  of  dose-dependency  or  the 
presence of a specific temporal pattern. These events have been considered as potential risks in 
the RMP. 
There are very limited data of macitentan in patients with IPF and associated PH/PAH (7 patients 
from  the  MUSIC-IPF  study).  However,  the  overall  data  with  macitentan  in  IPF  do  not  show  any 
safety signal. 
The SmPC (sections 4.2 and 4.4) reflects the limited clinical experience in patients over the age 
of 75 years, and therefore macitentan should be used with caution in this population.  
There is also a higher rate of discontinuation due to liver related AEs in the macitentan groups, 
showing  a  dose  response  of  2.4%  and  3.3%  in  the  macitentan  3  mg  and  10  mg  respectively 
compared  to  the  rate  of  1.6%  on  the  placebo  group.  These  results  can  not  totally  negate  the 
concern of hepatotoxicity. A post-hoc analysis of hepatic events has been conducted in patients 
at  high  risk  (those  who  had  a  history  of  liver  disease  at  screening;  n=114).  The  analysis  does 
show an increase in hepatic events between patients at high risk and those without risk factors, 
but  without  differences  between  macitentan  and  placebo  in  both  strata.  After  review  of 
summarized  information  on  hepatic  events  from  ongoing  or  recently  completed  studies  with 
macitentan (e.g. MUSIC IPF, ischaemic digital ulcers, glioblastoma), it can be concluded that the 
pattern of hepatic events (AEs related to hepatobiliary disorders as well as the incidence of liver 
test elevation) is different across indications.  
In  the  PAH  population,  the  lower  incidence  of  hepatic  events  in  macitentan-treated  patients 
versus placebo is likely to be related to the efficacy of macitentan versus placebo in preventing 
right  sided  heart  failure  and  associated  hepatic  congestion,  which  is  the  main  cause  of 
transaminase elevations in patients with PAH.  The incidence of ALT and/or AST > 3xULN (3.4% 
in the SERAPHIN study in the 10 mg group with a median exposure of 116 weeks) is well within 
the  range  observed  with  ambrisentan  (3.6%  from  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  at  1  year  in  483 
patients) and below that which had been observed with bosentan in PAH (11%-14% at the target 
dose  of  250  mg/day).  However,  there  are  no  head-to-head  clinical  studies  to  conclude  that 
macitentan  provides  an  improved  safety  profile  in  comparison  with  other  ERAs  (i.e.:  bosentan, 
ambrisentan).  Although  no  hepatic  signal  was  observed  in  the  SERAPHIN  study  in  PAH,  an 
imbalance  in  hepatobiliary  adverse  events  was  found  in  IPF  and  in  patients  with  essential 
hypertension. In conclusion, with the data available, a potential association between macitentan 
and risk of liver toxicity cannot be definitively ruled out.

Macitentan prolonged the values of some coagulation tests (e.g.: prothrombin time) in preclinical 
studies.  There  are  no  clinical  data  suggesting  a  potential  interference  of  macitentan  with 
coagulation tests in humans.  
There is a slightly higher incidence of bleeding events reported in the macitentan groups (19.6% 
and 18.6% in the macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg respectively) compared to placebo (14.5%). This 
was  mainly  driven  by  the  higher  incidence  of  gynaecological  bleedings  (6.9%  and  5.1%  in  the 
macitentan 3 mg and 10 mg respectively) compared to placebo (1.1%). Importantly, there is no 
dose  response  observed  in  all  these  reported  bleedings.  In  general,  concomitant  administration 
of  antithrombotics  or  PDE5  inhibitors  was  associated  with  a  higher  bleeding  rate,  which  is 
expected. No direct causal relationship can be found between macitentan administration and the 
increased bleeding events. There are no known PK interactions between macitentan and warfarin 
or sildenafil. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Prevention  of  PAH-related  morbidity/mortality  is  the  most  important  target  in  PAH.  This  is  the 
first application in PAH that provides a pivotal study appropriately designed and powered to show 
an outcome benefit of a specific therapy in patients with PAH. The benefit of macitentan 10 mg 
versus placebo in the chosen primary endpoint was highly clinically relevant, corresponding to an 
overall  relative  risk  reduction  of  45%  and  a  number-needed-to-treat  (NNT)  of  approximately  6 
patients needed to prevent an event at 2 years, and was accompanied by consistent favourable 
effects  in  other  clinically  relevant  endpoints  (e.g.:  improvement  in  WHO  FC,  dyspnoea 
symptoms, quality of life, reduced hospitalizations, and hemodynamic parameters). However, the 
positive results were mainly driven by events signifying clinical worsening rather hospitalisation. 
In  addition,  SERAPHIN  study  had  some  drawbacks  related  to  mortality  data  that  preclude 
including a mortality claim (see section about “uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial 
effects”). 
The  unfavourable  effects  were  mainly  class  effects  seen  with  other  ERAs  (e.g.:  oedemas, 
anaemia transaminase increase) that are manageable in standard practice. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The importance and magnitude of the clinically relevant favourable effects of macitentan on the 
clinical course of PAH exceeds the importance and magnitude of the unfavourable effects.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Clinical data available supports the efficacy of macitentan 10 mg OD in the long-term treatment 
of PAH in adults. The efficacy has been shown in adult patients with functional class II and III, as 
monotherapy or in combination with other PAH therapies (PDE-5 inhibitors and prostanoids), in a 
PAH  population  with  idiopathic  and  heritable  PAH,  PAH  associated  with  connective  tissue 
disorders,  and  PAH  associated  with  corrected  simple  congenital  heart  disease.  The  agreed 
indication  does  not  include  any  specific  claim  and  should  be  interpreted  in  light  of  the  more 
robust evidence with macitentan from SERAPHIN regarding delay in clinical worsening of PAH in 
comparison  with  other  PAH  therapies  where  claims  have  been  limited  to  the  6MWT  and/or 
symptoms.  However,  as  comparative  studies  are  lacking,  no  final  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on 
their relative benefit in patients with PAH.

5.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  CHMP  by  consensus  is  of  the  opinion  that  Opsumit/macitentan  is  not  similar  to  sildenafil, 
iloprost,  bosentan  and  ambrisentan  within  the  meaning  of  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation 
(EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Opsumit for the following indication: 
Opsumit,  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination,  is  indicated  for  the  long-term  treatment  of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients of WHO Functional Class II to III. 
Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  a  PAH  population  including  idiopathic  and  heritable  PAH,  PAH 
associated  with  connective  tissue  disorders,  and  PAH  associated  with  congenital  heart  disease

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that macitentan is qualified as a new active substance.

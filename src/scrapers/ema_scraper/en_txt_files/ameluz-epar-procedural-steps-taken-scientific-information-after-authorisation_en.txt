and PL 
of field cancerization" to the following: 
Treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell 
carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to 
possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor 
cosmetic outcome in adults. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. Editorial changes have been 
proposed in sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.2, 6.6 and 9 of the 
SmPC. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are 
updated accordingly. There are two new warnings 
that have been included in section 4.4 that the use of 
immunosuppressants during treatment with Ameluz 
is not recommended and of the risk of transient 
global amnesia. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.

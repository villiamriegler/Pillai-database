Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Disease or condition  
The company applied for the following indication: 
“CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults 
following prior systemic therapy”. 
Epidemiology 
Liver cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer (accounting for approximately 90% of cases). 
 
 
 
The highest incidence is reported in regions where infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is endemic i.e. 
Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. However, liver cancer also represents a significant burden in 
developed countries. The estimated incidence and mortality in the European Union (EU) were 52,000 
and 48,000 cases, respectively (Ferlay et al 2013). The incidence of HCC generally increases with 
advancing age: the average age at diagnosis is in the mid-60s, with a shift over the last decade to 
diagnosis at an earlier age (Cancer Research UK 2017). There is a strong male preponderance, with 
HCC occurring more than twice as often in men than in women. In contrast to the trends for most 
other cancers, liver cancer incidence and death rates have increased in recent years in Europe (Cancer 
Research UK 2017). 
Risk factors for HCC include conditions that lead to cirrhosis or other liver dysfunction: HBV or hepatitis 
C virus (HCV) infection, alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) especially 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. As the incidence of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome increase, 
NAFLD/NASH is becoming a major cause of HCC in developed countries. Some degree of cirrhosis is 
present in 80-90% of patients with HCC.  
In HBV-infected patients, nucleotide therapy may mitigate the cirrhotic process and consequent 
development or recurrence of HCC. In HCV-infected patients, direct-acting antivirals can eradicate HCV 
infection, but do not tend to reduce the occurrence and recurrence of HCC in most patients.  
Patients with HCC may experience no symptoms until their disease is advanced. Disease-related 
symptoms include anorexia and unexplained weight loss, nausea and vomiting, hepato- or 
splenomegaly, abdominal or shoulder pain, abnormal bruising or bleeding, jaundice and fever. If the 
patient is cirrhotic, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and GI bleeding may occur. Laboratory 
abnormalities, other than elevated liver function tests (LFTs), include hypercalcemia, hypoglycaemia, 
elevated serum cholesterol, erythrocytosis and thrombocytopenia. 
Management 
Treatment options and prognosis are determined by extent of HCC disease as well as the severity of 
the underlying cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh classification has been used to assess hepatic reserve in 
cirrhotic patients by scoring five variables (serum albumin, total bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy and 
prothrombin time). Patients with a score of 5 or 6 are classified as Child-Pugh class A and are 
considered to have well-compensated liver disease. Child-Pugh B or C patients have higher scores and 
a worse prognosis. 
Various classification systems have been constructed to prescribe treatment and predict outcome in 
HCC. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) is widely used and comprises four elements: tumour 
extension, liver functional reserve [Child-Pugh grade], physical status [ECOG PS] and cancer related 
symptoms.  
Surgical resection, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation are potentially curative in patients 
with early stage disease; however, these interventions are not an option for most patients because of 
tumour size or location. Patients who present with advanced disease or those with recurrence after 
locoregional therapy have a very poor prognosis. HCC is usually resistant to systemic cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and this is not recommended outside of a clinical trial. Palliative transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) is a widely-used option for patients with unresectable disease without 
extrahepatic involvement.

HCC (adapted from Bruix et al).

OLT, orthoptic liver transplantation 
Sorafenib, a small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR and other protein kinases, was shown in a Phase 3 
randomized placebo-controlled study (SHARP) to improve OS compared with best supportive care 
(BSC) in subjects with advanced HCC and relatively well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) who 
had not received previous systemic treatment. Median OS was 10.7 months in the sorafenib and 7.9 
months in the placebo arm (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55, 0.87; p-value < 0.001). The SHARP trial was 
conducted primarily in Europe and Australasia with HCV and alcohol being the most frequent HCC 
aetiologies (Sorafenib EPAR).  
In a corresponding placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial conducted in an Asian-Pacific population HBV was 
the main cause of HCC: median OS was 6.5 months vs 4.2 months (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50, 0.93; p-
value = 0.014).  
Recently, lenvatinib was shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib in subjects who had not received prior 
systemic therapy (Lenvima EPAR).  
Disease progression usually occurs following sorafenib or lenvatinib and more therapeutic options are 
needed. Several randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials in subjects with advanced HCC who had 
received prior sorafenib treatment failed to demonstrate an overall survival advantage with other 
systemic therapies, including brivanib [Llovet et al 2013], everolimus [Zhu et al 2014], ramucirumab 
[Zhu et al 2015] and tivantinib [Arqule 2017].  
Regorafenib demonstrated positive OS results in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled RESORCE trial in 
subjects who had progressed on prior sorafenib (Bruix et al [Lancet] 2017). Median OS for regorafenib 
compared to placebo was 10.6 vs 7.8 months; HR = 0.63 (95% CI 0.50, 0.79; p < 0.0001). The 
RESORCE trial excluded patients who did not tolerate sorafenib, defined as < 400 mg qd for ≥ 20 of 
the last 28 days before discontinuation (Regorafenib EPAR).  
 
 
 
About the product 
Cabozantinib (XL 184) inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases known to influence tumour growth, 
metastasis and angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), MET 
(hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] receptor protein) and AXL.  
Cabozantinib (Cabometyx), a film-coated tablet formulation, has been authorised in the EU at a dose 
of 60mg QD for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) following prior VEGF targeted 
therapy since September 2016. In March 2018 the CHMP adopted an extension to the existing 
indication to include previously untreated patients with advanced RCC (EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0003).  
The tablet and the capsule are not bioequivalent and should not be used interchangeably. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults 
following prior systemic therapy 
Further to the CHMP assessment the following indication is agreed: 
CABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults 
who have previously been treated with sorafenib. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
This application is to expand the use of Cabometyx for advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). An 
ERA addendum has been prepared to refine the Fpen and PEC. 
An assessment for PBT indicated that cabozantinib does not meet the criteria for bioaccumulation 
designation. 
Using the refined Fpen, based on the incidence or prevalence of advanced renal cell carcinoma and 
advanced HCC, the PECSURFACEWATER value is below the action limit of 0.01µg/L.

2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
A Phase I ERA conducted calculating the Fpen and PECSURFACEWATER using up to date (January 
2018) data for RCC and HCC resulted in a PEC value of 0.015µg/L, which is above the trigger value of 
0.01µg/L. A Phase II environmental effect analysis was therefore needed, in accordance with 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2.  
The Applicant was requested to provide a refinement of the Fpen and the PECSURFACEWATER, based 
on the incidence or prevalence of only advanced RCC and advanced HCC. Using the refined Fpen the 
PECSURFACEWATER value is below the action limit of 0.01µg/L.  
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of cabozantinib.  
- Considering the above data, cabozantinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) data analysis and the bioanalytical assay results are provided in the 
following reports: 
• Clinical Pharmacokinetics Report for XL184-309 (XL184-309.PK.001) 
• Bioanalytical Report for XL184-309 (EXE-R4078) 
Bioanalysis 
Concentrations of cabozantinib in plasma (XL184-309) were analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS 
method at Frontage Laboratories (Exton, PA). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.5 ng/mL. 
PK samples were not assayed for break-down products of cabozantinib. Plasma cabozantinib 
concentrations (XL184-203.RTD) were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method (BA-SR-165.00 
and AD13-339). 
Pharmacokinetics in Study XL184-309 
Bioanalytical Method 
Method BTM-1662-R0 is a validated LC-MS/MS method for the determination of cabozantinib (XL184) 
in K 2EDTA human plasma using XL184-d4 as the isotope-labelled internal standard (IS). Cabozantinib 
(XL184) in K2EDTA human plasma was stable for 350 days at -70 °C and cabozantinib (XL184) stock 
and spike solutions were stable at -20 °C for 349 days. At least 836 days at -70 °C of sample storage 
stability is required to sufficiently cover the longest span of time from collection date until date of 
analysis for the study samples evaluated in Watson Runs 1-36. An evaluation for extended sample 
storage stability at -70 °C will be conducted prior to the issuance of the final cumulative bioanalytical 
assay report for Study XL184-309. 
Calibration Standards and QC Samples 
The QC samples, at concentrations of 1.50 ng/mL, 80.0 ng/mL, 800 ng/mL and 2500 ng/mL (Dilution 
QC) for cabozantinib (XL184), were prepared in four batches. The QC samples were stored at -70 ºC. 
RESULTS 
Concentrations of QC Samples 
The concentrations for the QC samples should be within ±15.0% of the nominal concentration. No 
more than 1/3 of the QC samples may be out of specification. At each concentration, at least 50% of 
the QC samples should be within the above specification. All the injected batch runs met the defined 
acceptance criterion.  
Back-calculated Concentrations of Calibration Standards 
For a batch run to be acceptable, at least 75% of the total number of calibration standards or at least 
twelve calibration standards in the calibration range, including the LLOQ and ULOQ, must not deviate 
by greater than ±15.0% (±20.0% at the method LLOQ concentration) from their nominal values.  
Plasma Cabozantinib Concentrations in Placebo Arm Subjects 
A total of 233 placebo subjects had PK concentration data (PK population); a total of 230 placebo 
subjects had 563 eligible records in the analysis dataset. Most of the samples were below the limit of 
quantification of 0.5 ng/mL, except for 5 records with measurable concentrations (ranged from 0.834 
to 33. 3 ng/mL). The levels are considered low and negligible and are likely due to contamination. 
 
Plasma Cabozantinib Concentrations in All Cabozantinib Arm Subjects 
A total of 453 cabozantinib subjects had PK concentration data (PK population); a total of 449 
cabozantinib subjects had 1111 eligible records in the analysis dataset. Summary statistics for the 
concentrations are presented in Table 5.  
The mean plasma concentration values were higher for females than for males, but the spread of the 
standard deviations between males and females overlapped. 
The Analysis Eligible Population included all subjects: subjects remained on the same dose, subjects 
experienced dose reductions or dose hold prior to PK assessments and subjects may not have achieved 
steady-state concentrations at the cohort-assigned dose (i.e., did not receive at least 14 of 15 days of 
the 60 mg FBE/day cabozantinib doses over the 15 days immediately prior to the PK visit) due to a 
prior dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.

60 mg FBE/day cabozantinib doses over the 15 days immediately prior to the PK visit (i.e., the Steady-
State Population) and had PK samples collected and analyzed at all visits, (i.e., W3D1, W5D1 and 
W9D1). There were 12 subjects (1 female and 11 males) in the cabozantinib treatment arm who met 
eligibility based on the number of doses received and PK sample collection below. Summary statistics 
for the concentrations are presented in Table 7.

Population Pharmacokinetics analysis 
OBJECTIVES 
The primary objectives of this analysis were to: 
• Develop a population PK model to characterize the cabozantinib concentration-time profile in healthy 
volunteers and subjects with various cancer types including HCC 
• Investigate selected covariate effects especially those leading to potential differences in PK for 
subjects with HCC compared to healthy volunteers and subjects with other cancer types. 
Study Design 
The population PK analysis included integrated plasma cabozantinib concentration-time data from 
healthy subjects and cancer patients with different types of malignancies. Pertinent details regarding 
the design and pharmacokinetic sampling scheme for each study are provided in Table 8. 
 
Table 8: Summary of study design and pharmacokinetic sampling scheme 
METHODS 
An integrated population PK model was previously developed to characterize the cabozantinib 
concentration-time profile in healthy volunteers (140 and subjects with various cancer types). All 
studies listed in Table 8 were used to develop this model except Study XL184-309 and HCC subjects 
from Study XL184-203. The integrated PK model was a two-compartment model with first-order 
elimination and combined zero-order and first-order absorption (Figure 1). The first-order absorption 
process included a lag time and a dose dependent effect on the absorption rate (ka) which was 
characterized using a power model. In addition, a formulation effect was included on ka and relative 
bioavailability to quantify differences in the rate and extent of absorption between the capsule and 
tablet formulations. Ka and relative oral bioavailability for the capsule formulation were 58% and 14% 
lower than that for the reference tablet formulation, respectively. Several demographic covariate 
effects were included in the integrated PK model; however, the magnitude of these covariate effects 
 
 
was generally small. The exception was for the MTC population which was predicted to have an 
approximately 93% increase in apparent clearance resulting in over 40% lower Cmax,ss and 50% 
lower Cmin,ss relative to healthy subjects.

Modelling: Software and Strategy 
The analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling methodology as implemented in 
the NONMEM software system, version 7.3 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). 
RESULTS 
External Visual Predictive Check 
Cabozantinib concentrations in patients with HCC were predicted using the previously described 
integrated PK model. This model included tumour type as a covariate; however, HCC was not among 
the tumour types evaluated. Therefore, the predictive performance of the model was evaluated 
assuming the reference condition for HCC relative to RCC patients. VPC results in Figure 2 showed 
that, overall, the observed concentrations were generally contained within the prediction intervals, 
suggesting that cabozantinib PK is similar between HCC and RCC patients.

309 
Updated Population PK Model 
The analysis dataset was updated with the addition of PK data in patients with HCC from Study XL184-
203 and Study XL184-309 including a total of 1883 patients. Initially, the HCC population effect on 
CL/F and Vc/F was evaluated in addition to previously defined covariates. Subsequently, the effect of 
hepatic impairment on CL/F and Vc/F was assessed using the categorical covariates of mild and 
combined moderate/severe liver dysfunction. 
Goodness-of-fit plots (data not shown) for the updated integrated PK model for cabozantinib suggested 
good agreement between geometric mean observed data and model predictions [i.e. typical individual 
predictions (PREDs) and individual predictions (IPREDs)].  
Parameter estimates and corresponding 90% confidence intervals are shown in Table 6 for the updated 
integrated model including HCC patients and for the same model including the assessment of liver 
dysfunction effects on cabozantinib PK. With the addition of HCC patients, PK parameter estimates and 
covariate effects were similar to the previous integrated PK model. For a White male subject, CL/F at 
steady state was estimated as 2.48 L/hr and Vc/F as 212 L. Inter-individual variability (expressed as 
percent coefficient of variation [%CV]) was approximately 46% for CL/F and 67% for Vc/F.

Graphical Summaries of Covariate Effects 
Forest Plots 
The impact of covariates was assessed on steady state minimum plasma drug concentration (Cmin,ss), 
steady state maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax,ss), steady state area under the plasma drug 
concentration-time curve over the 24 hour dosing interval (AUC(0-24,ss)), CL/F and Vc/F for specified 
covariate values (i.e. test conditions) relative to a reference set of covariate values. Specifically, the 
reference condition was defined as a White male, healthy subject with a body weight of 80 kg, 60 
years of age, receiving a 60-mg free base equivalent cabozantinib tablet once daily with steady state 
PK profile simulated on Day 57. The test condition differs from the reference by changing a specific 
covariate value. All other covariate values were identical to the reference. For continuous covariates 
 
 
 
such as age and weight, 5th and 95th percentiles in the updated integrated analysis dataset (age: 37 
and 79 years; weight: 54 and 109 kg) were used to represent extreme covariate values. 
Similar to the previous analysis, age, body weight and race did not have impact on cabozantinib CL/F. 
The MTC cancer type had the largest effect on cabozantinib PK parameters and exposure metrics 
among the covariates examined. The CL/F estimate was 24% lower in females, resulting in 27% higher 
Cmax,ss and 35% higher Cmin,ss and AUC(0-24,ss). Covariate effects on Vc/F included glioblastoma 
multiforme (~50% decrease in Vc/F), high body weight (~50% increase in Vc/F) and low body weight 
(~30% decrease in Vc/F).

Updated Integrated Model Predictive Performance 
The predictive performance of the updated integrated PK model was evaluated using a VPC. The VPC 
statistics (data not shown) were largely contained within the 90% prediction intervals indicating that 
the updated integrated PK model could simulate concentration-time data that were consistent with the 
observed data. 
Absorption 
No new data have been submitted on the absorption profile of cabozantinib. 
Distribution 
No new data on the protein binding or distribution profile of cabozantinib, other than the popPK 
estimate of V/F, have been submitted. In the original popPK analysis, the apparent volume of 
distribution was 319 L (SE ±2.7%). The volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F) is 
now estimated to be 212 L. 
Elimination 
No new data on the metabolism of cabozantinib have been submitted. No new data on the elimination 
of cabozantinib, other than the popPK estimate of CL/F, have been presented with the current 
application. lasma half-life and estimated mean steady state CL/F have been changed from 99 hours to 
110 hours and from 2.2 L/hr to 2.48 L/hr, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No new data on dose proportionality and time dependencies of cabozantinib have been submitted. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-subject variability (%CV) of CL/F and Vc/F in the popPK model analysis were estimated to be 
46% and 67%, respectively. Intra-individual variability has not been reported. 
Special populations 
With the addition of HCC patients, the model-estimated PK parameters and covariate effects were 
similar to the previous integrated PK model (XL184-308.PopPK.002). 
Hepatic impairment 
The mean 60 mg steady state plasma concentration at W5D1 in RCC subjects (XL184-308, subjects 
with normal liver function) was 1260 ± 559 ng/mL (n=211), whereas the mean 60 mg ss value at 
W5D1 in HCC subjects (XL184-309, mostly subjects with Child-Pugh A) was 1180 ± 554 ng/mL 
(n=181). This is in contrast to the hepatic impairment study (XL184-003), where non-cancer subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) had an 81% increase in single-dose cabozantinib 
exposure (AUC0-inf) and a 75% increase in terminal half-life compared with subjects with normal 
hepatic function. The increase in cabozantinib exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh B) relative to normal hepatic function (63% increase in AUC and 70% increase in terminal 
half-life) was slightly lower than observed for Child-Pugh A subjects. 
The PopPK analysis updated to evaluate PK of cabozantinib in patients with HCC showed that HCC and 
RCC subjects receiving a 60 mg daily cabozantinib dose appeared to have similar CL/F and s-s 
exposure (AUC). Furthermore, popPK results indicated that liver dysfunction, as defined by NCI-ODWG 
criteria, had no discernible effect on cabozantinib clearance: subjects with mild hepatic impairment 
appeared to have similar cabozantinib PK as subjects with normal hepatic function (Figure 8). There 
was no observed difference for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (n=15) relative to subjects 
with normal hepatic function; however, the sample size was small. 
Normal-to-mild hepatic dysfunction (NCI-ODWG) was shown to correlate with Child-Pugh A status in a 
Phase I study in cancer subjects administered imatinib mesylate (Patel et al 2004).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cabozantinib inhibits VEGFR2, MET and AXL with cell-based IC50 values of 8, 2 and 77 nM, 
respectively. Oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in blockade of MET phosphorylation in human 
lung tumour xenografts grown in athymic nude mice, blockade of MET phosphorylation in livers of 
mice, and blockade of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in mouse lung tissue. For both targets, at least 50% 
inhibition lasted for over 8 hours post-dose at a single dose level of 100 mg/kg. Cabozantinib 
abrogated tumour growth by dual blockade of VEGFR2 and MET in an HCC xenograft mouse model. 
Cabozantinib prolonged survival in a MET -driven transgenic mouse model of HCC.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-Response Analyses: Efficacy 
Time-to-event ER models were developed using Cox proportional hazards (CPH) methodology. Efficacy 
endpoints evaluated were: overall survival-early (OSE; survival among subjects with ≤8 weeks of 
study treatment), overall survival-late (OSL; survival among subjects with ≥12 weeks of study 
treatment) and PFS. The covariates evaluated included baseline ECOG score, disease aetiology and 
presence/ absence of extrahepatic spread.  
The exposure metric for OSE analysis was the cabozantinib average concentration (Cavg) over the first 
four weeks of treatment (CAVGOSE) while the exposure metric for OSL analysis was the cabozantinib 
Cavg calculated over the 28 days prior to the Week 12 landmark (CAVGOSL). Nonlinear models were 
evaluated over a grid of fixed EC50 values for average cabozantinib plasma concentrations ranging 
from 100 to 3000 ng/mL. 
 
The relationship of tumour size (sum of target tumour diameters) with cabozantinib average exposure 
was described using a longitudinal model that incorporated first-order tumour growth, linear decay due 
to drug treatment and attenuation of the drug effect. 
Table 11: Number of Events and Number of Subjects at Risk in Efficacy Analysis Datasets 
Overall survival early (OSE): 
The linear, nonlinear and step function models did not result in statistically significant reductions in the 
negative 2 log likelihood value (-2LL) compared to the model without cabozantinib exposure. 
Therefore, no relationship was identified for OSE and cabozantinib plasma exposure. 
Overall survival late (OSL): 
A statistically significant relationship between individually predicted cabozantinib Cavg and survival 
was observed in subjects receiving cabozantinib for at least 12 weeks (OSL). For all comparisons the 
confidence interval does not include one. Relative to a 60 mg dose, higher HRs were estimated for OSL 
for a 40 mg and 20 mg dose (1.19 and 1.43 respectively) based on predicted average s-s cabozantinib 
concentrations (Cavg) values, suggesting that OSL was improved with increasing cabozantinib plasma 
exposure. No significant covariates were observed based on the full model results.

for the 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg once daily dosing regimens.

dashed lines represent 95% confidence intervals. 
Figure 9: Predicted Fraction of Subjects with Overall Survival-Late 
Progression-free survival (PFS): 
A statistically significant relationship was also identified between cabozantinib plasma Cavg and the 
risk of disease progression or death (PFS). Increases in cabozantinib plasma concentration are 
predicted to decrease the risk of disease progression or death in a nonlinear manner. The EC50 value 
for PFS for the Emax model was 500 ng/mL. The typical individual predicted s-s cabozantinib plasma 
 
 
Cavg for the 60 mg dose (1148 ng/mL) is approximately 2-fold greater than the estimated EC50 value, 
suggesting that the anticipated s-s exposures from the 60 mg dose would fall in the range of 
efficacious concentrations on the Emax ER curve. Relative to a 60 mg dose, higher HR values were 
estimated for PFS for a 40 mg and 20 mg dose (1.18 and 1.60 respectively) based on predicted s-s 
cabozantinib Cavg values.

Covariate analysis was performed based on fixing EC50 = 500 ng/mL. The final model for PFS included 
the following three covariates: average cabozantinib exposure over the previous 3 weeks (EXNL), HBV 
and interaction between EXNL and HBV aetiology. Subjects with increasing cabozantinib concentrations 
are predicted to have a decreased risk of progressive disease or death; subjects with HBV are 
predicted to have a higher baseline risk of progressive disease or death. However, at higher 
cabozantinib concentrations the HR is similar with or without the HBV covariate effect.

Survival Model 
Tumour size: 
These plots are not representative of the actual magnitude of effect since the model does not consider 
patient dropout. Although the actual percent change in tumour size cannot be estimated, the model 
predicts inhibition of tumour growth at all cabozantinib doses (20, 40 and 60 mg/day); there was 
greater inhibition of tumour growth with increasing dose. Reduction in tumour size was observed only 
at a daily dose of cabozantinib 60 mg. 
 
 
The attenuation half-life for the typical subject was 161.9 days indicating that the tumour decay rate 
due to drug was essentially zero by 648 days.

Panel) with Cabozantinib Assuming no Patient Dropout 
Exposure-Response Analysis: Safety 
Time-to-event analyses using CPH methodology were performed to determine if ER relationships could 
be identified between cabozantinib plasma exposure and key safety endpoints: dose modification, 
fatigue, nausea/vomiting, PPES, diarrhoea, hypertension, ALT/AST elevation and total bilirubin 
elevation.

c Systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg or Diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg. 
d Total number of events including subjects with at least one measurable cabozantinib concentration and subjects 
receiving at least one dose of placebo. 
Dose Modification 
The relationship between individual predicted cabozantinib apparent clearance (CL/F) and the rate of 
dose modifications (reductions or interruptions) was assessed using the linear model described and the 
nonlinear models, evaluated over a grid of fixed EC50 values for CL/F ranging from 0.1 to 6 L/hr. A 
statistically significant relationship was identified between individual predicted cabozantinib CL/F and 
the rate of dose modifications. Increased cabozantinib clearance and the corresponding decreased 
cabozantinib exposure are predicted to decrease the rate of dose modifications e.g. a subject with a 
cabozantinib clearance of 0.95 L/hr is predicted to have 1.8-fold greater risk of dose modification 
relative to a subject with a CL/F of 1.95 L/hr.  
 
Table 15: Hazard Ratios for Relative Rate of Dose Modification 
Adverse Events 
Statistically significant relationships between average cabozantinib concentration and the rate of some 
adverse events were noted. Increases in average cabozantinib plasma concentrations were associated 
with increases in the risk of PPES (≥  Grade 1), diarrhoea (≥  Grade 3) and hypertension (SBP > 160 
mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg). The predicted HRs were 3.24 (2.61, 4.02), 1.64 (1.28, 2.10) and 2.16 
(1.75, 2.67) for PPES, diarrhoea and hypertension, respectively, based on the predicted steady-state 
average cabozantinib concentration for a 60 mg dose (1148 ng/mL) relative to a 20 mg dose (383 
ng/mL). 
Statistically significant treatment effects but not cabozantinib concentration effects were found for 
fatigue (≥  Grade 3) and ALT/AST elevation (≥  Grade 3). A higher rate of event (2.6 × for fatigue and 
1.8 × for ALT/AST elevation) was predicted for cabozantinib compared with placebo treatment.  
No significant relationships were found between cabozantinib exposure or treatment and 
nausea/vomiting (≥  Grade 3) or total bilirubin elevation (≥  Grade 3). However, the frequencies of 
events for these endpoints were low, 16 for N/V and 17 for total bilirubin elevation from a total of 689 
subjects receiving either cabozantinib or placebo. 
Repeated Time-to-Event (RTTE) Model for Dose Modifications of Any Kind (DMAK) 
A RTTE model was developed to describe DMAK with cabozantinib treatment in HCC subjects. The 
DMAK model was used to simulate repeated dose modification event times over 12 months. All 
subjects started at 60 mg in Study XL184-309 so observed data are only reported for the 60 mg 
starting dose. The model included a baseline hazard and a nonlinear drug effect which was described 
by an Emax model using daily Cavg cabozantinib as the exposure parameter. The EC50 was predicted 
as 260 ng/mL (90%CI: 170-400 ng/mL), suggesting a high rate of dose modifications for the 60 mg 
dose with a predicted average exposure of 1148 ng/mL for a typical patient. Adaptive dose simulations 
predicted the percentage of patients on hold or on 20, 40 or 60 mg after 1, 3, 6 or 12 months of 
cabozantinib treatment. 
 
The percentages of subjects on each dose were somewhat under-predicted at later times particularly 
when ‘on hold’ doses were included. Differences between the observed and simulated datasets may 
reflect the lack of a drop out model based on PD or death or may indicate that more complexity 
regarding the dose change model is necessary.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant updated the previously developed population PK model of cabozantinib in healthy 
subjects and cancer subjects with data from subjects with HCC from studies XL184-309 and the HCC 
cohort of XL184-203 RDT. The model predicted exposure parameters (Cmax, Cmin and AUC) appeared 
comparable across the HCC, RCC and all cancer patients (excluding MTC) groups. The covariates, age, 
body weight and race did not have significant effect on cabozantinib apparent oral clearance (CL/F), 
whereas the MTC population had ~ 90% increase in CL/F. Section 4.2 of the SmPC was therefore 
revised to state that no dose adjustment is necessary based on ethnicity. 
Based on an integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib in healthy subjects and 
cancer patients (including HCC), no clinically significant difference in the mean cabozantinib plasma 
exposure was observed amongst subjects with normal liver function (n=1425) and mild hepatic 
impairment (n=558). Therefore, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment. 
 
There is limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=15) as per NCI-ODWG (National 
Cancer Institute – Organ Dysfunction working Group) criteria. No dosing recommendation can be 
provided. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients. 
The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib was not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh C) so cabozantinib is not recommended for use in these patients (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2 of the SmPC). 
In the exposure response analysis of overall survival, no relationship was identified for OSE and 
cabozantinib plasma exposure in patients exposed for up to 8 weeks. A statistically significant 
relationship between individually predicted average cabozantinib concentration and survival in subjects 
receiving cabozantinib for at least 12 weeks was observed: OSL was improved with increasing 
cabozantinib plasma exposure. A 60 mg dose showed improvement in OSL and PFS over a modelled 40 
mg starting dose. Relative to 60mg dose exposure, the HR at modelled 40mg dose exposure was 1.19. 
The EC50 and EC80 value for PFS was 500 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL, respectively. The typical individual 
predicted steady-state average cabozantinib concentrations for the 60 mg tablet dose is 1148 ng/mL. 
Most of the cabozantinib exposures are thus expected to be in the steep phase of the dose-effect-
hazard curve. 
Reduction in average cabozantinib plasma concentrations were associated with reduction in the risk of 
PPES (≥ Grade 1), diarrhoea (≥ Grade 3) and hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg). 
The predicted HRs were 0.66, 0.86, and 0.76 for PPES, diarrhoea and hypertension, respectively, 
based on the predicted steady-state average cabozantinib concentration for a 40 mg dose relative to a 
60 mg dose.  
Therefore, from the ER modelling, efficacy increases with the 60mg relative to a hypothetical 40mg 
starting dose, whilst some AEs are more likely with the increased dose. These AEs can be monitored 
and managed symptomatically and with dose reductions if required but may cause distress to patients. 
Diarrhoea can be difficult to manage. PPE and diarrhoea were a cause of treatment discontinuation.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package is considered acceptable to support the extension of indication to 
HCC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose experience from prior studies conducted in subjects with HCC and other tumour types 
The single-agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cabozantinib in the first-in-man study (XL184-
001) in 85 subjects with advanced malignancies based on the first 28 days of continuous dosing was 
determined to be 140 mg qd (as capsules) (Kurzrock et al 2011). This dose was used in the pivotal 
Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled Study XL184-301 in subjects with medullary thyroid cancer. 
However, dose reductions were frequent (79%) and 41% of subjects required a second dose reduction 
to 60 mg. 
The PopPK report for cabozantinib (XL184-308.PopPK.002) showed that subjects with MTC have 93% 
higher steady state (ss) CL/F than healthy subjects or subjects with other tumour types, including 
RCC, and thus ~45% lower ss plasma concentrations. A subject with MTC administered a 140 mg dose 
would achieve an estimated ss plasma concentrations comparable to that of a ~77 mg dose in a 
subject with a non-MTC tumour type. 
Cabozantinib at an assigned oral dose of 100 mg qd using an earlier development capsule formulation 
was studied in the nine-cohort Phase 2 randomised discontinuation study of XL184 in subjects with 
advanced solid tumours: XL184-203 RDT. Over half of the 41 HCC subjects (59%) required at least 
one dose reduction to 60 mg; however, only 24% required a second dose reduction to 40 mg. The 
median daily dose for the HCC cohort was 66 mg (the median daily dose for other cohorts containing 
≥ 40 subjects ranged from 65 to 83 mg) and the median time to first dose reduction was 39.5 days. ss 
trough level PK exposures obtained in study XL184-203 RDT were consistent across different tumour 
types including the HCC cohort: geometric mean Cthrough at the end of Week 6 were 781 ng/mL (HCC) 
and 864-1180 ng/mL (non-HCC). 
When the Phase 3 study XL184-309 was initiated, preliminary results from a single-dose Phase 1 Study 
XL184-003 in non-cancer subjects had shown higher exposure in those with impaired hepatic function 
compared with normal hepatic function [AUC 0-inf increased by 81% and 63% in subjects with mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment, respectively (90% CI for AUC 0-inf: 121.44% to 270.34% for mild and 
107.37% to 246.67% for moderate)]. Based on these results, the estimated median daily exposure to 
cabozantinib in HCC subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) dosed at 60 mg was 
comparable to a 95 mg dose (60 mg × 159%) in non-hepatically impaired subjects. This was equal to 
or slightly lower than exposures associated with the assigned dose in Study XL184-203 RDT (100 mg) 
or the adjusted median daily in the HCC subjects (105 mg = 66 mg × 159%).   
Clinical activity at a cabozantinib starting dose of 60 mg or lower had been observed in other 
indications with acceptable tolerability: at 20 and 40 mg in subjects with castration-recurrent prostate 
cancer (Lee et al 2013), although the lower dose of 20 mg was less active, and at 40 mg and 60 mg in 
subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (Nokihara et al 2015). 
Based on these data, 60-mg/day dose was selected as the dose in Study XL184-309 because it was 
expected to provide increased tolerability, relative to the previously studied 100-mg dose, while 
maintaining efficacy in subjects with advanced HCC and providing an adequate safety margin for the 
expected increase in exposure in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared with subjects with 
normal hepatic function. 
Dose experience in subjects with HCC in Phase 3 Study XL184-309 (60mg tablet QD) 
•  62% of cabozantinib-treated subjects had a dose reduction and 84% had a dose interruption 
due to an AE. 
•  Median average daily cabozantinib dose was 36 mg. 
•  Median time to first dose reduction (to 40 mg) and second dose reduction (to 20 mg) was 38 
and 83 days, respectively. 
•  Most frequent last non-zero dose level (excluding dose interruptions) was equally split between 
the 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg dose levels (39%, 28%, and 33% of subjects, respectively). 
•  Median time on the cabozantinib arm at the 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg dose was 28 days, 33 
days and 73 days, respectively. 
In study XL184-308 (advanced RCC) using the same dose and formulation: 
•  60% of cabozantinib-treated subjects had a dose reduction and 63% had a dose interruption 
due to an AE. 
•  Median average daily cabozantinib dose was 45 mg. 
•  Median time to first dose reduction (to 40 mg) and second dose reduction (to 20 mg) was 55 
and 93 days, respectively. 
•  Most frequent last non-zero dose level (excluding dose interruptions) was 60 mg (43% of 
subjects) with the 40 mg and 20 mg dose levels received by 40% and 17% of subjects, 
respectively. 
•  Median time on the cabozantinib arm at the 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg dose was 73 days, 83.5 
days, and 117 days, respectively. 
Observed cabozantinib ss exposures in Child-Pugh A hepatically impaired HCC subjects (XL184-309) 
were unexpectedly not higher than in non-hepatically impaired RCC subjects (XL184-308). The PopPK 
analysis updated to evaluate PK of cabozantinib in patients with HCC showed that HCC and RCC 
subjects receiving a 60 mg daily cabozantinib dose appeared to have similar CL/F and s-s exposure 
(AUC). Furthermore, covariates related to liver function were shown not to have a significant impact on 
cabozantinib PK (XL184-309.PopPK.001). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
XL184-309: CELESTIAL. A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study of 
Cabozantinib (XL184) vs Placebo in Subjects with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who 
Have Received Prior Sorafenib 
Methods 
This was a Phase 3 multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of cabozantinib in 
subjects with HCC who had received prior sorafenib. At the time of study inception, there were no 
approved systemic therapies for the treatment of advanced HCC following sorafenib treatment.  
PPD (Wilmington, NC) was the contract research organization for this study and was responsible for 
clinical conduct, monitoring, data management, biostatistical analysis, PK data analysis and medical 
writing in conjunction with Exelixis.

Treatments 
Eligible subjects received oral cabozantinib 60mg qd or matched placebo. Subjects were instructed to 
take blinded study drug once daily, orally at bedtime, after a 2 hour fast (except for water) and to 
have no food for at least 1 hour after dosing. Study sites were supplied with cabozantinib as 60-mg 
and 20-mg yellow film-coated tablets. Placebo tablets were supplied to match the 20mg and 60mg 
cabozantinib tablets.  
Subjects continued blinded study treatment whilst they experienced clinical benefit in the opinion of 
the Investigator (even after disease progression per RECIST 1.1), or until unacceptable toxicity, the 
need for subsequent systemic anticancer therapy or liver-directed local anticancer therapy, or other 
reasons for treatment discontinuation. Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed during the 
blinded treatment phase.   
If one of the planned analyses showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful evidence of 
improved OS, the study could transition to an Open-Label Phase as decided by the Sponsor in 
discussion with regulatory authorities. Upon transitioning to the Open-Label Phase, the study was to be 
unblinded and subjects who were randomized to the placebo arm would have the option to crossover 
to receive treatment with cabozantinib provided they met the eligibility criteria. Data from the Open-
Label Phase were not included in the CSR. 
Two dose reductions, in decrements of 20 mg cabozantinib or matched placebo, were permitted to 
manage or prevent worsening of an AE or toxicity.  
Dose Modification Criteriaa  
Toxicity Criteria 
Recommended Guidelines for Management 
Grade 1 AEs 
Study treatment continued if AE tolerated 
Grade 2 AEs which were intolerable and 
At the discretion of the Investigator, study treatment 
could not be adequately managed 
dose reduced or interrupted. 
Note: dose interruptions should be as brief as possible. 
Grade 3 (except clinically non-relevant 
Study treatment interrupted unless toxicity easily 
laboratory abnormalities) 
managed with dose reduction and optimal medical care. 
Grade 4 AEs (except clinically non-
Study treatment interrupted immediately and 
relevant laboratory abnormalities) 
discontinued unless the following criteria were met:  
Subject deriving clear clinical benefit as determined by 
the Investigator and agreed by the Sponsor 
Toxicity managed with a dose reduction (40mg then 
20mg) following recovery to Grade 1 (or baseline) and 
optimal medical care 
a Study treatment dose adjustment was only needed if the toxicity was deemed related to study 
treatment or had an unclear relationship to study treatment. 
Subjects could be re-escalated to the previous dose (but not higher than 60 mg/day) at the discretion 
of the Investigator, with agreement of the Sponsor, for AEs resolved or recovered to Grade 1 (or 
baseline value) and deemed tolerable and easily managed by optimized supportive treatment. All study 
treatment had to be discontinued if a once-daily dose of 20 mg cabozantinib/matched placebo was not 
tolerated. Guidelines for management and prevention of GI, hepatobiliary, blood system, 
 
 
 
 
constitutional, skin, hypertension, thromboembolic events, proteinuria, QT prolongation, haemorrhagic 
events, GI perforation/fistula, non-GI fistula formation and osteonecrosis of the jaw were provided in 
the protocol. 
Prophylactic antiemetics and anti-diarrhoeal medications were allowed in accordance with standard 
clinical practice if required. GCSF was acceptable but not to be administered prophylactically before 
initial treatment with study drug. Erythropoietic-stimulating agents (e.g. epoetin alfa and darbepoetin 
alfa) were not to be used. Hormone replacement and short-term systemic steroids could be utilized as 
indicated by standard clinical practice. 
Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors was to be avoided, per the current SmPC.   
Therapeutic doses of heparins were allowed after randomization if clinically indicated and the benefit 
outweighed the risk per the Investigator’s discretion. Therapeutic doses of oral anticoagulants (e.g. 
warfarin or warfarin-related agents, thrombin or FXa inhibitors, antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel) 
were not allowed. 
Any herbal product used for the treatment of HCC was prohibited. If a subject required additional liver-
directed local anticancer therapy, study treatment must have been discontinued. Palliative external 
beam radiotherapy to bone or skin/subcutaneous metastases was allowed but discouraged unless 
medically unavoidable. 
Objectives 
The study objective was to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib compared with placebo— both in the 
setting of BSC—on overall survival in subjects with previously treated advanced HCC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
•  Overall survival (OS) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Objective response rate (ORR)  
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS)  
Additional endpoints: 
•  Safety and tolerability of cabozantinib 
•  Relationship of baseline and changes in biomarkers with treatment and/or clinical outcome 
•  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)  
• 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Duration of OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 
ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) as determined by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1. 
Duration of PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of the following events: 
radiographic progressive disease (PD) as determined by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 or death due 
to any cause. Clinical deterioration was not an event for the primary analysis. 
CT/MRI assessments were performed at screening, 8 weeks after randomization (W9D1) and every 8 
weeks thereafter. Disease status was determined at the local site (i.e. investigator and/or radiologist) 
using RECIST version 1.1. The same imaging modalities used at screening were used for subsequent 
tumour assessments. Scan assessments continued per this schedule irrespective of whether study 
treatment was reduced, interrupted or discontinued, until the latter of 8 weeks after radiographic 
disease progression per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Investigator or the date of the decision to 
permanently discontinue study treatment.  
For the liver evaluation a non-contrast followed by a triphasic (arterial, portal and delayed venous) 
post-contrast CT study or a liver MRI with gadolinium imaging was obtained. MRI of the brain was 
acquired at screening if clinically indicated and post-baseline only if documented brain metastases or 
suspicion of brain metastasis on study. All subjects were to have a bone scan at screening. Follow-up 
bone scans were to be performed at 8 and 16 weeks after randomization, and every 16 weeks 
thereafter only for subjects with documented bone lesions on the screening bone scan or suspicion of 
bone metastases on study. Time point progression could be based solely on bone scans if there was 
unequivocal evidence of new bone scan lesions; increases in bone scan lesions present at baseline 
could not be used for the determination of progression per RECIST 1.1. 
For the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), subjects were to assess the following 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The options for each were: 
no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems or unable to/extreme problems. 
Then on a visual analogue scale (VAS), subjects were to quantitate their health between 100 (“best 
health you can imagine”) and 0 (“worst health you can imagine”). Subjects were given the 
questionnaire at baseline (W1D1), every 4 weeks until Week 25 and then every 8 weeks until the latter 
of 8 weeks after Investigator- determined radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of the 
decision to permanently discontinue study treatment. 
A blood sample for determination of serum AFP was obtained at the time of each radiographic 
(CT/MRI) disease assessment visit. Samples were analysed by a central laboratory; the results were 
not provided to the Investigator until the decision had been made to discontinue study treatment. 
Assessment of plasma biomarkers by multiplexed array included target receptors and ligands (e.g. 
VEGF-A, HGF, soluble VEGFR2 and MET). These exploratory analyses were not reported. Circulating 
tumour cell (CTC) samples were collected at selected sites and exploratory analyses may be performed 
if adequate sample is available. Tumour tissue (archival or recently biopsied) was obtained at 
enrolment when available. An exploratory analysis for MET tumour expression was performed. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 760 subjects with a total of 621 events (and 2 interim analyses) provides the study 
with 90% power for a two-sided log-rank test at the 5% level of significance to detect a 31.6% 
increase in OS (HR = 0.76). 
Assuming a median OS of 8.2 months in the placebo arm (based upon the BRISK trial; Llovet et al 
2013) and exponential distribution, this corresponds to median OS of 10.8 months in the cabozantinib 
arm. For the primary OS endpoint, the minimum observed effect that would result in statistical 
significance at the two interim analyses and the final analysis are 42.1% improvement (HR = 0.70, 
from 8.2 to 11.7 months), 25.7% improvement (HR = 0.80, from 8.2 to 10.3 months) and 18.4% 
improvement (HR = 0.84, from 8.2 to 9.7 months), respectively. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised by an IxRS in a 2:1 fashion to receive cabozantinib or matched 
placebo. Randomisation was stratified by the following: 
•  Disease aetiology (HBV [with or without HCV], HCV [without HBV], Other) 
•  Geographic region (Asia, Other) 
• 
Extrahepatic disease spread and/ or microvascular invasion (Yes, No) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Placebo was indistinguishable from cabozantinib. Study treatment 
assignment was unknown to the subjects, investigators, study centres, Sponsor (other than those 
authorized access to treatment assignment for IxRS or drug supply management) and any affiliated 
contract research organization. No individual subjects were unblinded prior to the data cut-off date. 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) monitored unblinded safety data to protect subject 
welfare and to provide recommendations regarding study conduct. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized subjects regardless of whether any 
study treatment or the correct study treatment was received. The ITT population was used for efficacy 
analyses. 
The Safety population consisted of all randomized subjects who received any amount of study 
treatment (either cabozantinib or cabozantinib-matched placebo). Analyses based on the Safety 
population were performed according to the actual treatment received. Subjects randomized to 
placebo who received any amount of cabozantinib in error were summarized in the cabozantinib group. 
Analysis of the primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS. The primary analysis population was the ITT population. 
Duration of OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. For subjects 
who were permanently lost to follow-up and not known to have died at the time of data cut-off, 
duration of OS was right censored at the date the subject was last known to be alive. Those who 
withdrew consent from follow-up and were alive were right censored at the date the subject withdrew 
consent from follow-up. Subjects alive on or after the data cut-off or those who died after the data cut-
off were right censored at the date of data cut-off. 
Hypothesis testing between the two treatment arms was performed using the stratified log-rank test. 
The stratification factors were the same as those used to stratify the randomisation. 
The median duration of OS and the associated 95% CI for each treatment arm was estimated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method. The stratified HR and its 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional-
hazard model with treatment arm as the independent variable and stratified by the same 
randomization stratification factors as were used for the log-rank test.  
Interim analyses 
Up to 3 OS analyses were planned: 2 interim analyses and a final analysis occurring when 
approximately 311, 466, and 621 deaths (i.e. ~ 50%, 75% and 100% of the required number of 
deaths) had been observed. To preserve the overall type I error of the study at 2-sided 0.05, a Lan-
DeMets O’Brien- Fleming alpha-spending function was used. If exactly the planned number of events 
were seen at each analysis the critical p-values for rejecting the null hypothesis at each analysis were 
0.0031, 0.0183 and 0.044, respectively. The actual critical values depended upon the true number of 
events observed at each analysis. 
Results of interim analyses were evaluated by the IDMC to allow the trial to be stopped early if the null 
hypothesis for OS was rejected in favour of cabozantinib. Formal futility analyses were not planned. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Progression-Free survival per investigator 
Duration of PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of the following events: 
progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. 
The hypothesis testing of PFS between the two treatment arms occurred only if the result of either an 
interim or the final OS analysis achieved statistical significance. Hypothesis testing was performed 
using the stratified log-rank test at the two-sided α=0.04 level of significance. The stratification 
factors were the same as those used for the primary analysis. 
The median duration of PFS and the associated 95% CI for each treatment arm were estimated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method. The HR was estimated using a Cox regression model and included the same 
stratification factors noted for the log-rank test. 
General censoring rules for the primary analysis of PFS were as follows: 
•  Subjects who received systemic or liver directed local NPACT, non-protocol radiation therapy 
(other than to bone), or surgery to resect tumour lesions before experiencing an event were 
right censored at the date of the last ATA on or prior to the date of initiation of subsequent 
therapy/surgery. 
•  Subjects who had not experienced an event (and were not otherwise censored) at the time of 
data cut-off were right censored on the date of their last tumour assessment after 
randomization that was on or prior to the data cut-off. 
•  Subjects missing two or more ATAs (defined as 126 days without an ATA) followed by an event 
(progression or death) were right censored on the date of their most recent ATA prior to the 
missing assessments.  
If there were no such tumour assessment after randomization, the subjects were right censored on the 
date of randomization. 
Two sensitivity analyses of PFS (PFS 2 and PFS 3) were defined in the SAP. 
For PFS2 analysis, the following were considered as events: 
•  Radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 
•  Death due to any reason 
• 
Treatment discontinuation due to clinical deterioration 
•  Receipt of systemic NPACT/ local liver-directed NPACT/ radiation (other than to bone)/ surgery 
to resect tumour lesions 
For PFS3 analysis, the following were considered as events: 
•  Radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 
•  Death due to any reason 
• 
Treatment discontinuation due to clinical deterioration 
Objective Response Rate per Investigator 
The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a CR or PR, confirmed ≥28 days after 
the response was first observed, as determined by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1.  
The hypothesis testing of ORR between the two treatment arms occurred only if the result of either an 
interim or final OS analysis achieved statistical significance. Hypothesis testing per IxRS was 
performed using Fisher’s exact test at the two-sided α=0.01 level of significance. 
Adjustment for multiplicity 
Up to three event-driven analyses of OS were planned as follows: two interim analyses and a final 
analysis. Inflation of Type 1 error associated with interim analyses was controlled using a Lan-DeMets 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function. 
Testing of the secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR occurred only if the result of either an interim 
analysis or the final analysis of OS achieved statistical significance. The hypotheses for PFS and ORR 
were tested in parallel. PFS was tested at the two-sided α=0.04 level of significance and ORR was 
tested at the two-sided α=0.01 level of significance. 
All other statistical evaluations of efficacy were descriptive. 
Subgroup analyses 
Exploratory analyses of OS, PFS, and ORR were conducted to explore the effect in subgroups defined 
by baseline characteristics. These comprised:  
•  Age (<65 years, 65 to <75 years, 75 to <85 years, ≥85 years) 
•  Sex (Male, Female) 
•  Race (Asian, Black or African American, White, Rest of the races reported/not reported)

Results 
Participant flow 
Disposition was similar in the ITT and Safety Populations. Three patients in the ITT population were 
randomised to cabozantinib but no study treatment was given. An explanation to why these patients 
did not receive treatment has not been provided.

A total of 704 subjects received study treatment (Safety population): 467 subjects in the cabozantinib 
arm and 237 subjects in the placebo arm.  
 
 
A total of 605 subjects in the Safety population discontinued study treatment as of the data cut-off 
date of 01 June 2017: 394 subjects (84%) in the cabozantinib arm and 211 subjects (89%) in the 
placebo arm. There was a higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs in the cabozantinib arm 
(cabozantinib 21% vs placebo 5%), including AEs related to study treatment (16% vs 3%). 
Conversely, there was a higher rate of disease progression in the placebo arm (cabozantinib 44% vs 
placebo 64%). Other reasons had a similar incidence in each arm. 
A total of 316 subjects failed screening as of the 01 June 2017 cut-off date. The main reasons were

Recruitment 
At the 01 June 2017 cut-off date for the second planned interim OS analysis, a total of 707 subjects 
were randomized to receive study treatment (ITT population), 470 subjects in the cabozantinib arm 
and 237 subjects in the placebo arm. The study has subsequently been fully enrolled (773 subjects by 
18 September 2017, planned total 760) and closed to enrolment. 
Of the 707 subjects enrolled in the study by the cut- off date, 25% in each arm were enrolled in Asia 
and 75% in Other Regions (North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand). Enrolment by region 
and by country was well balanced between treatment arms. 
Conduct of the study 
•  Protocol amendments 
The original protocol, dated 12 March 2013, was amended twice. 
Amendment 1.0, dated 23 April 2014, introduced the following substantive changes: 
Clarified three inclusion criteria: 
•  1 - subjects without prior histological or cytological diagnosis of HCC required a biopsy  
•  12- lower limit of serum albumin was 2.8 g/dL 
•  14 - HbA1c testing window was extended to 28 days prior to randomization 
Clarified four exclusion criteria: 
•  8b(i) - subjects with Crohn’s disease excluded  
•  8e- subjects with disease invading the inferior vena cava excluded 
•  8g(i) - subjects with active hepatitis infection controlled with antiviral therapy eligible  
•  9 - subjects with history of variceal bleeding treated with adequate endoscopic therapy eligible 
Added additional post-screening Child-Pugh testing time points 
Added QT prolongation to the list of potential cabozantinib AEs requiring management and added 
information regarding use of drugs known to prolong QT 
Specified that all subjects were to have hepatitis virus testing via central laboratory prior to enrolment 
but the results were not required for randomization 
Introduced the Maintenance Phase, which subjects were to enter when sufficient data had been 
collected to evaluate all study endpoints 
Amendment 2.0, dated 12 July 2016, had the following substantive changes: 
Introduced the Open-Label Phase so that, following demonstration of statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in OS by cabozantinib, subjects in the placebo arm who met specific 
eligibility criteria could crossover to receive cabozantinib. Subjects randomized to the cabozantinib arm 
who were still receiving study treatment, and subjects randomized to the placebo arm who were still 
receiving study treatment and did not crossover to cabozantinib, could continue unblinded study 
treatment. The Sponsor would only implement the Open-Label Phase following review of the data and 
discussion with regulatory agencies. 
Collection of healthcare resource utilization data (hospitalizations, intensive care unit and emergency 
department visits) for all reported SAEs. Thus, data would be assessed retrospectively in most cases.

Eligibility criteria deviations were balanced between the cabozantinib and placebo arms: 24 (5.1%) and 
11 subjects (4.6%), respectively, failed to meet at least one eligibility criterion. The most frequent 
inclusion criteria deviation was not meeting the requirement for a Child-Pugh score of A (6 [1.3%] and 
1 [0.4%] subjects, respectively). One subject each arm did not have a histological/cytological 
diagnosis of HCC; both had baseline liver lesions, extrahepatic spread and macrovascular invasion. The 
most frequent exclusion criteria deviation was failure to meet the restrictions against use of 
concomitant anticoagulants (5 [1.1%] and 5 [2.1%] subjects respectively). 
Review of on-study deviations suggested that they did not have a notable impact on study safety or 
efficacy. Important on-study protocol deviations were balanced between the cabozantinib and placebo 
treatment arms. Randomization irregularity was most frequent, including stratification errors by 
incorrect assignment of the disease aetiology and/or the presence of extrahepatic spread of disease 
and/or macrovascular invasion as reported in IxRS compared with CRF.  
Important protocol deviations categorized as ‘Other’ that could have potentially impacted safety 
included revised ICF not signed by subject and ECGs not obtained per protocol or not reported to the 
independent central review vendor (ERT) in a timely manner or at all. Deviations categorized as ‘Other’ 
that potentially impacted efficacy included tumour imaging not obtained per protocol. 
•  Changes to the planned analysis 
The original SAP (version 1.0) was dated 2 November 2015. Revisions to create the final SAP (version 
2.0) were stated to occur before database lock and unblinding. Key changes included: 
•  Statistical tests of efficacy to be performed using IxRS stratification factors instead of 
stratification factors based on CRF 
• 
• 
• 
Per protocol population deleted, as analyses by ITT population were deemed more robust 
Progression updated to accept new lesions identified on bone scan as evidence of progression 
consistent with the protocol. Adequate tumour assessments to include unscheduled 
assessments. 
PFS sensitivity analyses (PFS2 and PFS3) refined to exclude treatment discontinuation due to 
AEs 
Table 20: Summary of Differences in Stratification Factors per IxRS vs per CRF (ITT Population) 
Treatment compliance 
A similar proportion of subjects in the cabozantinib arm (99 subjects [21%]) and placebo arm (38 
subjects [16%]) had their dose interrupted for reasons other than an AE. The primary reason was 
subject non-compliance (cabozantinib 16%, placebo 8.9%). Only one subject (cabozantinib arm) had 
an overdose (took 120mg on Days 2 and 6). No subjects received the wrong study treatment.

Central laboratory assessment of hepatitis viral status was instituted following Protocol Amendment 1; 
a total of 510 subjects (344 cabozantinib arm, 166 placebo arm) enrolled in the study following 
implementation of this requirement. 
Selected baseline laboratory values were well balanced between treatment arms. Approximately 42% 
of subjects had baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. 
Child-Pugh scores were collected at screening and (following Protocol Amendment 1.0) every 8 weeks 
after randomization (W9D1, W17D1, etc). Nearly all subjects were Child-Pugh A at baseline as required 
in the protocol. At Week 9 Day 1, there was a similar rate of Child-Pugh A to B conversion in each arm: 
39/249 (16%) in the cabozantinib and 20/136 (15%) in the placebo arm. The same distribution was 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seen at later weeks but due to the high rates of treatment discontinuation, analysis of changes in 
Child-Pugh score at later time points was not robust and therefore not presented.

b Three subjects on the cabozantinib arm received prior systemic anticancer therapy that was administered for adjuvant HCC 
treatment but not for advanced HCC treatment per the CRFs.  
c In the cabozantinib arm, Subject 3366-3517 received sorafenib (multiple instances) and doxorubicin, and Subject 9102-3262 
received sorafenib and concomitant bevacizumab plus rapamycin (recorded as separate regimens). In the placebo arm, Subject 
1513-3278 received sunitinib and multiple instances of sorafenib. These three subjects were not included in the table of eligibility 
deviations regarding line of therapy. 
d Specific systemic cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents received by ≥  1% of subjects in either arm were: doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, 
cisplatin, gemcitabine, capecitabine, fluorouracil 
e Multiple episodes of TACE on the same day were counted as a single administration. 
Prior therapies were defined as having a start date prior to first dose of study treatment. 
Prior radiation therapy for HCC was well balanced between treatment arms and received by 176 
subjects (37%) in the cabozantinib and 93 subjects (39%) in the placebo arm. The most frequent sites 
of radiation for HCC were soft tissue (cabozantinib 30%, placebo 28%) and bone (10%, 13%). The 
most frequent types of radiation therapy for HCC were external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; 
cabozantinib 15%, placebo 18%), radiofrequency ablation (15% of subjects in each arm), and 
radioembolization (cabozantinib 6%, placebo 5%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis:  
Overall Survival (OS) 
Analysis of OS was based on a second planned interim analysis prespecified to be performed at 
approximately the 75% information fraction (i.e. ~ 466 deaths). By the data cut-off date for this 
event-driven analysis (01 June 2017), a total of 484 deaths (78% actual information fraction) were 
reported. Survival status was determined for 99% of the 707 randomized subjects as of the database 
cut-off date. A total of 13 subjects withdrew consent including for survival follow-up. In the OS 
analysis, 9 of these 13 subjects (5 cabozantinib, 4 placebo) were censored at their date of withdrawal 
of consent, the remaining 4 subjects (3 cabozantinib, 1 placebo) had death dates available from public

(and were censored) on this date. 
Median follow-up time to 01 June 2017 was 22.9 months. No values were imputed.

First Planned Interim Analysis 
A prespecified first interim OS analysis was performed at approximately the 50% information fraction 
(321 events; 52% actual information fraction) and was reviewed by the IDMC, who recommended the 
trial continue in a blinded fashion. Exelixis learned of the results of the first interim analysis only after 
the primary endpoint was met at the second planned interim analysis. The treatment effect observed 
at the two planned interim analyses was similar. The critical p-value per the Lan-DeMets O’ Brien

Objective Response Rate per Investigator per RECIST 1.1 
ORR was tested at the 2-sided α=0.01 level of significance by applying a modified Bonferroni 
procedure. Tumour assessments that occurred after the individual subject PFS-censoring dates were 
excluded from the analysis. In the cabozantinib arm, 18 subjects (4%) had a BOR of PR compared with 
1 subject (0.4%) in the placebo arm; no subjects had a CR.

Exploratory Endpoint Analyses 
Serum Alpha – Fetoprotein 
Serum AFP was assessed at baseline and every 8 weeks (W9D1, W17D1, etc), on the same schedule 
as tumour CT/MRI assessments. Among subjects with post-baseline data, 109/373 (29%) in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cabozantinib arm and 13/192 (7%) in the placebo arm had ≥50% post-baseline decreases in serum 
AFP. 
Change in Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein Compared with Baseline (ITT Population) 
a Best change is the largest decrease (or smallest increase if no decrease) from baseline; worst change from baseline is the largest 
increase (or smallest decrease if no increase) from baseline 
Serum Bone Biomarkers 
Serum bone biomarkers (BSAP, CTx and NTx) were collected. Among subjects with post-baseline data: 
•  6/410 (1%) in the cabozantinib arm and 0/219 (0%) in the placebo arm had a ≥  50% 
postbaseline decrease in serum BSAP 
•  123/412 (30%) in the cabozantinib arm and 3/218 (1%) in the placebo arm had a ≥  50% 
postbaseline decrease in serum NTx 
•  259/407 (64%) in the cabozantinib arm and 13/218 (6%) in the placebo arm had a ≥  50% 
post-baseline decrease in serum CTx 
Health Related Quality of Life: EQ-5D-5L  
EQ-5D-5L scores were summarized by five functional dimensions (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each split into five increasing severity levels from 1 (no problem) 
to 5 (extreme problem). An effect size for change from baseline ≥  0.3 was considered potentially 
clinically meaningful. The EQ-5D-5L was converted into a single index value normalized across 10 
countries in which the index has been validated. EQ-Index values range from 0 (dead) to 1 (full 
health). The minimal important differences (MID) for these questionnaires in cancer patients were 
previously established as 0.06 to 0.08 for EQ-Index, and 7 for EQ-VAS (Pickard et al, 2007). 
The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire completion rate (number of subjects who completed all questions/subjects 
still on study) remained above 85% in each treatment arm until Week 33. After W33D1, there were 
fewer than 20 subjects in the placebo arm.  
For post-baseline changes, the largest treatment difference occurred at the W5D1 time point for 
mobility and usual activities (effect size difference in favour of placebo of 0.51 and 0.55, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects in the cabozantinib and placebo arm with any problem (Levels 2-5) at W5D1 
was 61% vs 32% for mobility and 68% vs 43% for usual activities. 
At baseline, mean EQ-Index scores were 0.792 in the cabozantinib and 0.855 in the placebo arm. At 
W5D1, EQ-Index change from baseline in the cabozantinib arm was more negative compared with 
placebo (mean change from baseline: -0.117 vs -0.019) and thus favoured placebo. Subsequent 
treatment differences in mean change from baseline EQ-Index values were < 0.06 through W25D1. 
Beyond this time point there were fewer than 20 subjects in the placebo arm.  
 
EQ-Index is scored from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates better health-related quality of life status. Number of subjects at baseline 
with EQ-Index scores - 206 in the cabozantinib and 96 in the placebo arm 
Figure 15: Mean (±SE) Change from Baseline of EQ-Index Score (ITT Population; Countries in which EQ-
Index Is Validated) 
At baseline, mean EQ-VAS scores were 73.5 in the cabozantinib arm and 76.1 in the placebo arm. All 
treatment differences in mean change from baseline EQ-VAS values were < 7 through W33D1. Beyond 
this time point there were fewer than 20 subjects in the placebo arm. 
EQ-VAS is scored from 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine).  
Original number of subjects at baseline was 452 (cabozantinib) and 234 (placebo)

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses for OS and PFS 
Many subgroups were analysed and the size and number of events in each subgroup varied widely. 
Subgroup analyses were not powered to detect a treatment difference. 
 
 
Table 31: Subgroup Analyses for OS and PFS (ITT Population) 
a HR and 95% CI were estimates from the Cox proportional-hazard unstratified model.  
b One subject in the cabozantinib arm enrolled in the study with a baseline ECOG PS of 2. This subject was not included in the 
corresponding subgroup analysis table. 
c Visceral sites defined based upon review of the reported sites once data had been entered in the database. 
d Three subjects enrolled having received ≥  3 prior systemic anticancer regimens (SCE, Section 2.1.2.2). These subjects are not 
included in the corresponding subgroup analysis table. 
e For the exploratory analysis of MET, status of high or low/negative was based on cut-off of ≥  50% of tumour tissue stained with 
an intensity of 2+ or 3+. Cut-off based on historical HCC and non-small cell lung cancer data. 
 
 
For each of these subgroups there was a consistently higher use of systemic NPACT in the placebo 
arm. 
For subjects who received 1 prior regimen the OS HR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.59, 0.92) and PFS HR was 
0.43 (95% CI 0.35, 0.52). For subjects who received 2 prior regimens the unstratified OS HR was 0.90 
(95% CI 0.63, 1.29) and unstratified PFS HR was 0.58 (95% CI 0.41, 0.83).  
Concomitant medications 
Non-protocol anticancer therapy (NPACT) and OS 
At the date of first receipt of NPACT; per protocol, subjects had to discontinue study treatment. The 
incidence of systemic non-radiation and local liver-directed systemic NPACT was 26% in the 
cabozantinib arm and 33% in the placebo arm.

3.2% (15 subjects) in the cabozantinib arm and 5.5% (13 subjects) in the placebo arm. 
There is a minor difference in censoring due to the use of NPACTs in the two treatment arms. 
 
Table 33: Systemic NPACT used by ≥1% of subjects in either treatment arm (ITT 
Population) 
At each level of summarization, a subject was counted only once if the subject reported one or more therapies. 
a Subjects may be counted in more than one category. 
b Specific systemic cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents shown are those received by ≥1% of subjects in either arm. 
The median (range) time from randomization to first systemic non-radiation NPACT was 202 (26, 765) 
days in the cabozantinib arm and 99.5 (42, 590) days in the placebo arm.  
As an exploratory analysis, the OS analysis was repeated censoring survival times for subjects who 
received a systemic or a local liver-directed NPACT after randomization prior to their date of death, 
consent withdrawal or last known to be alive at the date of first receipt of such therapy; per protocol, 
subjects receiving these therapies had to discontinue study treatment. Results were consistent with 
those of the primary OS analysis.

Previous treatment with sorafenib only 
In an ad hoc subgroup analysis of subjects who received sorafenib as the only prior agent for HCC 
(70% of subjects), median OS was 11.3 months with cabozantinib versus 7.2 months with placebo 
(unstratified HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.92; stratified HR per IxRS 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.88). Median 
PFS in this subgroup was 5.5 months with cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo (unstratified 
HR 0.42: 95% CI: 0.34, 0.52; stratified HR per IxRS 0.40, 95% CI 0.32, 0.50).

Supportive study 
• 
Phase 2 Study XL184-203 RDT 
Study XL184-203 RDT was a randomized phase 2 discontinuation study of cabozantinib in subjects 
with advanced solid tumours. Subjects were enrolled into one of nine cohorts based on tumour type. 
One of these cohorts comprised advanced HCC subjects.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The RDT design consisted of two stages.  
Lead in stage: Eligible subjects with advanced solid tumours received open-label cabozantinib at a 
starting daily dose of 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks; all subjects underwent tumour assessment at 6 
and 12 weeks.  
Randomised stage or open-label extension: At the end of the 12-week open-label, single arm Lead-In 
Stage, subjects with demonstrated stable disease could enter the Randomized Stage and were 
randomised 1:1 to receive cabozantinib or matching placebo in a blinded manner. Subjects received 
blinded treatment until development of PD or an unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with an objective 
response (confirmed or unconfirmed CR or PR) at Week 12 could continue open-label cabozantinib and 
subjects with disease progression discontinued study treatment. 
Primary Endpoints: 
Lead-In Stage: Objective Response Rate (ORR) per mRECIST version 1.0, per investigator 
Randomized Stage: Progression Free Survival (PFS) per mRECIST version 1.0, per investigator. The 
comparison of PFS between the cabozantinib and placebo arms was performed using the log-rank test 
in the randomized population. 
Study population 
A total of 526 subjects were enrolled at 42 sites in the US, Belgium, Israel and Taiwan, including a 
cohort of 41 subjects with advanced, recurrent or metastatic HCC and Child-Pugh A. Diagnosis was by 
core biopsy or by CT/MRI including angiography and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 400 ng/mL in 
subjects with liver cirrhosis and/or chronic HBV or HCV. Subjects could have received no more than 
one prior standard regimen. 
The first subject was enrolled on 02 September 2009. The last subject last assessment across all 
cohorts was 30 May 2013 (the last assessment for the HCC cohort was 03 August 2012). A 
retrospective analysis of OS was conducted based on subjects’ available survival status on 26 June 
2013. 
Subjects were mainly White (54%) or Asian (37%); 76% of subjects were male. Their median age was 
60 years, and median weight was 71.5 kg. All subjects had ECOG PS of 0-1. The median time since 
diagnosis was 1.0 year. Subjects could have HCC based on multiple-recorded aetiologies: the most 
frequent reasons were cirrhosis (44%), unknown (29%), HBV (24%), HCV (24%) and alcohol-related 
(20%). A total of 20% of subjects had not received a prior treatment regimen. Prior sorafenib was 
received by 54% of subjects. 
Study results 
Two of 41 subjects with HCC (4.9%, 95% CI 0.9, 16.1) had a confirmed partial response (PR) on 
cabozantinib treatment during the 12-week Lead-in Stage and a further 31 subjects (76%) had stable 
disease. At Week 12, 27 subjects (66%, 95% CI 50.0, 79.5%) had disease stabilization (response or 
stable disease). Five subjects could not be evaluated or had missing assessments. Only three subjects 
(7.3%) showed evidence of primary refractory disease (PD as best response). 
A total of 22 HCC subjects were randomized to receive either cabozantinib or placebo. The median PFS 
per Investigator during the Randomized Stage was 2.5 months in the cabozantinib arm and 1.4 
months in the placebo arm (HR =0.815, 95% CI 0.313, 2.121; p=0.659).  
Median PFS for all HCC subjects from the initial cabozantinib dose was 5.2 months by Kaplan-Meier 
estimate (5.2 months for sorafenib pre-treated subjects [n=22] and 4.2 months for sorafenib-naïve 
subjects [n=19]). Survival was assessed retrospectively; median OS for all treated patients (n=41) 
from the initial cabozantinib dose as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 11.5 months (95% 
CI: 7.3, 15.6). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study was a Phase 3, randomised, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial and the design is 
considered adequate. There were no second line therapies authorised for treatment of advanced HCC 
post sorafenib at the time that the study was initiated, although regorafenib has since received a MA 
(CHMP opinion June 2017). Therefore, the placebo-control is appropriate. The 2:1 randomization 
allowed more subjects the chance to receive active treatment.  
The trial was worldwide, but recruitment was limited to 25% from Asian Geographic regions. This is 
appropriate given the differences in HCC aetiology between Asian and ‘Western’ populations, as well as 
variations in epidemiology, treatment approaches and treatment outcomes. Patients from Asian 
countries more typically have HBV associated HCC, which has been reported as having a worse 
outcome with TKIs compared with the more typical HCV -associated HCC in the West. Still, all patients 
with HBV were required to be treated with anti-viral therapy prior to enrolment.  
The patient population was adequately selected with appropriate inclusion/ exclusion criteria to define 
a target population whilst avoiding those potentially at increased risk of adverse events. Most subjects 
were Child Pugh A with relatively preserved liver function; only 1.3% in the cabozantinib arm had a 
Child-Pugh score of B. This means that efficacy/ safety in patients with more severe liver disease is 
unknown therefore cabozantinib is not recommended for use in these patients (SmPC section 5.2).   
Subjects who discontinued sorafenib due to intolerance could participate in the study, but it is not clear 
if any such subjects were recruited. 
Patients with HBV and HCV disease were included in the study. The applicant confirmed that all 
patients with active disease also had to be treated to be eligible for the study. No information was 
collected related to the time from resolution of the infection, or time from reaching a sustained off-
treatment virological response (SVR). 
Overall survival was the primary efficacy endpoint. This is an accepted regulatory endpoint and is the 
most appropriate for this patient population, given the relatively short expected median OS. To avoid 
confounding, cross -over from placebo to cabozantinib was not permitted during the blinded treatment 
phase, although was in a subsequent ‘open-label’ phase. It is not clear if an open-label phase was 
instigated. Details of non-protocol anti-cancer therapies (NPACT) were collected and their influence on 
OS investigated in an exploratory analysis.  
The secondary endpoints (PFS and ORR) were assessed only by Investigator with no independent 
radiology review. Although independent oversight is preferred, this is less important in a double-blind 
study and, also, they are secondary endpoints. However, bias in the readout might be introduced due 
to the toxicity profile being different between the two study arms.  
RECIST 1.1 was used for soft tissue tumour response assessment and is a widely accepted method. 
Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria have emerged as more sensitive than RECIST 1.1 to assess 
response of hepatic lesions in HCC. With mRECIST, non-enhanced tumour is not measurable, so 
response reflects tumour vascularisation more accurately and has been found to predict OS in 
multivariate analyses (Meyer, et al., 2017). Other recent applications have utilised mRECIST as the 
primary radiographic assessment (Stivarga SmPC), whilst the historical sorafenib studies used RECIST 
1.1. mRECIST may be technically challenging and difficult to implement with rigor in a multisite global 
clinical trial, without independent blinded centralised radiological review. Therefore, use of RECIST 1.1 
is accepted. Use of mRECIST tends to result in higher reported ORR than RECIST 1.1 but uniform PFS 
times.  
The analysis was changed from adjusting using the stratification factors per CRF to the IxRS, which is 
appropriate. The percentage discrepancies in reported aetiology (HBV/HCV) and presence of EHS/ MVI 
were similar in both arms between the CRF and the IxRS. The biggest discrepancy was in the 
determination of presence of EHS and/ or MVI with an extra ~6.5% of patients having EHS/MVI in the 
CRF vs. the IxRS. The CRF data is verified and corrected by study monitors. The IxRS data is based on 
(possibly limited) information available to investigators at the time of randomisation.   
CT/MRI scans were performed every 8 weeks regardless of whether study treatment was given, so 
treatment interruptions did not influence the timing/ detection of radiological progression events.  
There was no defined time scale from the end of previous therapy and recruitment to the cabozantinib 
trial. Median time from progression on the most recent systemic agent to randomisation was 1.61 
months in the cabozantinib arm (range 0-100.8). Therefore, most patients continued quickly to 
cabozantinib therapy on progression. Presumably, those with a longer interval underwent local liver-
directed therapy and could be surmised to have less active wide spread disease.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Important baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced between the 
treatment arms. Most subjects had extensive metastatic disease at enrolment. The most frequent sites 
of HCC disease at baseline per CRF were extrahepatic spread, with a similar distribution across both 
arms (79% in the cabozantinib arm vs 77% in the placebo arm). Approximately 41% of subjects had 
baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL.  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) status was not collected. It was 
assigned retrospectively using macrovascular invasion (MVI) as a surrogate for portal vein invasion. 
Whilst it is not clear that MVI is an appropriate surrogate, the treatment groups were well balanced in 
the BCLC stage B group (9% in cabozantinib arm versus 10% in placebo arm) and BCLC Stage C (91% 
in the cabozantinib arm versus 90% in placebo arm).  
Prior treatment with sorafenib was a prerequisite for the Phase 3 study population. This was to ensure 
a consistent study population and because sorafenib was the only therapy authorised for first line 
advanced HCC at the time that the study was conducted. All patients had received prior sorafenib (3 in 
the Cabometyx arm in the adjuvant setting only) and the proportion (~25%) who had received two 
prior systemic therapies was well balanced between the two treatment arms. The number of subjects 
who had received prior TKI therapies other than sorafenib were similar in the two groups (19 [4%] 
subjects in the cabozantinib group vs 12 [5.1%] in the placebo group). Specifically, in the cabozantinib 
arm, the additional TKIs received were regorafenib (n=6), axitinib (n=4) and investigational drug 
(n=5). No patients had received prior lenvatinib. Only 1 patient (placebo arm) had received prior 
lenvatinib; this is explained by the fact that lenvatinib has primarily been investigated first line against 
sorafenib and all trial subjects had to have received sorafenib.  
In view of the patient population treated in the pivotal trial, the indication was therefore restricted to 
treatment after prior sorafenib therapy. Cabozantinib is to be administered as monotherapy, which has 
also been reflected in the wording of the indication.  
Patients were Child Pugh A and ECOG PS 0 or 1 so efficacy in patients with poor performance status or 
more advanced liver disease has not been investigated.  
 
Results were analysed per the ITT population, which is acceptable; only 3 patients in the cabozantinib 
arm were randomised but not treated.  
At the second pre-planned interim analysis, the prespecified event-driven primary analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for subjects in the 
cabozantinib 60 mg qd arm compared with placebo: the HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per 
IxRS), was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.92; stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0049; critical p-value to reject 
the null hypothesis of equal OS = 0.021). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for median duration of OS were 
10.2 vs 8.0 months in the cabozantinib and placebo arms respectively, an estimated 2.2-month 
difference in the medians. The landmark estimate of the proportions of subjects that were event-free 
at 12 months was 46% compared with 34%. 
For the primary OS analysis, the stratified HRs (95% CIs) were the same using stratification factors 
per IxRS and CRF. 
The median duration of OS for the placebo arm was consistent with that seen in previous trials in a 
similar post-sorafenib setting in line with the target population with advanced disease [brivanib, 8.2 
months, Llovet et al 2013; everolimus, 7.3 months, Zhu et al 2014 and ramucucirumab, 7.6 months, 
Zhu et al 2015].  
The use of concomitant medications was similar between the two arms and is considered not to affect 
the OS outcome. 
Crossover from placebo to cabozantinib was not permitted up to the database cut-off date. Post 
progression, more subjects in the placebo than the cabozantinib arm received non-radiation systemic 
therapies (25% cabozantinib arm, 30% placebo arm). Only 3.2% and 5.5% respectively received 
subsequent local liver – directed therapy. The relatively infrequent use of NPACT reflects the lack of 
approved alternative therapies in this setting and possibly the poor performance status of patients. The 
median time from randomization to first systemic NPACT was longer in the cabozantinib arm (202 days 
vs 100 days). 
The incidence of systemic non-radiation and local liver-directed systemic non-protocol anticancer 
therapy (NPACT) was 26% in the cabozantinib arm and 33% in the placebo arm. Subjects receiving 
these therapies had to discontinue study treatment. An exploratory OS analysis censoring for the use 
of NPACT supported the primary analysis: the HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS), was 
0.66 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.84; stratified logrank p-value = 0.0005). The Kaplan- Meier estimates for 
median duration of OS were 11.1 months in the cabozantinib arm versus 6.9 months in the placebo 
arm, an estimated 4.2-month difference in the medians (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The treatment effect at the prespecified first interim OS analysis performed by the IDMC, although not 
statistically significant [stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0041; critical p-value to reject the null 
hypothesis = 0.0037] was consistent (stratified HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56, 0.90).   
The primary analysis of PFS (PFS1) as determined by the Investigator yielded a median duration of 
PFS of 5.2 months in the cabozantinib arm and 1.9 months in the placebo arm. The HR, adjusted for 
stratification factors (per IxRS), was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.52, stratified log-rank p-value < 0.0001). 
Both PFS curves, but particularly that for placebo showed a marked drop at 2 months, the time of the 
first follow-up assessment, and this accounts for more than 50% of patients in the placebo group, so 
actual PFS in the placebo arm was shorter than 1.9 months. Results of additional sensitivity analyses 
of PFS (PFS2 and PFS3) were consistent with the primary PFS1 analysis. 
There was a disparity between the median duration of cabozantinib exposure [3.8 months] (which 
includes time with dose interruptions) and PFS [5.2 months]. The explanation for the difference is 
likely to be that, while study treatment may end due to AEs or clinical progression, radiographic 
progression may not occur or be documented until later due to the half-life of cabozantinib, tumour 
growth dynamics and the 8-week scanning interval.  
The ORR rate was rather low; in the cabozantinib arm, 18 (4%) subjects had a BOR of PR compared 
with 1 (0.6%) subject in the placebo arm (unstratified Fisher exact test p-value per IxRS = 0.0059); 
there were no CRs in either arm. This was lower than seen with regorafenib (11% vs. 4%) but 
cabozantinib was assessed by RECIST v1.1 rather than mRECIST (regorafenib). The rate of stable 
disease in the cabozantinib arm relative to placebo was higher (60% vs 33%) and in line with 
regorafenib (65% vs. 36%). Conversely, more subjects in the placebo arm had PD as BOR (21% 
cabozantinib vs 55% placebo).  
A higher number of subjects experienced a decrease in AFP in the cabozantinib arm as compared to 
the placebo arm, overall supporting the primary efficacy data.  
Subgroup analyses showed a generally consistent effect on OS with HRs < 1 across most subgroups 
with ≥ 20 subjects in each treatment arm. No OS benefit was observed in subgroups with subjects 
from the Asian region (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.48), subjects with HCV (without HBV) per CRF (HR 
= 1.11, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.71) and subjects without extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion 
per CRF (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.65). However, median PFS with CABOMETYX treatment was 
shown in these subgroups. 
Benefit for cabozantinib was shown in the MET low/negative subgroup (cabozantinib n = 144, placebo 
n = 68) with an OS HR of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.92) and a PFS HR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.57). 
There were too few ‘MET high’ subjects in the placebo arm (cabozantinib n = 33, placebo n = 15) to 
determine relative benefit. 
Many subgroups were analysed and the size and number of events in each subgroup varied. Some 
findings may have arisen by chance alone or been driven by unbalanced known or unknown 
confounding factors. Subgroup analyses were not powered to detect a treatment difference.  
In an ad hoc subgroup analysis of subjects whose only prior therapy for HCC was sorafenib (70% of 
subjects), median OS was 11.3 months with cabozantinib versus 7.2 months with placebo (stratified 
HR [per IxRS] 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.88; unstratified HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.92).  
For subjects who received 1 prior regimen the OS HR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.59, 0.92), whilst for 
subjects who received 2 prior regimens the unstratified OS HR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.63, 1.29).  
Subjects could continue blinded study treatment after radiological disease progression, if, in the 
opinion of the investigator, they continued to receive benefit. A relatively high proportion of patients in 
both arms continued blinded treatment after radiological disease progression (32% in the cabozantinib 
and 49% in the placebo group), possibly until symptomatic progression as they were achieving clinical 
benefit or covering the time until new therapy was administered. The median number of days that 
treatment continued was short, but the full range was not presented: the median (Q1 to 3) was 13.50 
(5.00 to 64.50) days in the cabozantinib arm and 7.00 (4.00 to 29.00) days in the placebo group.  
Non-disease specific quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L. A negative effect 
of Cabometyx versus placebo on the EQ-5D utility index score was observed during the first weeks of 
treatment. Only limited QoL data are available after this period (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The phase 2 RDT is supportive of the outcome in the pivotal study. There are limited results from 
patients who have not received sorafenib at all (n= 17 HCC patients in Phase 2 XL 184-203). In this 
small cohort (a mixture of treatment naïve and patients who received other agents, mostly 
chemotherapy) the estimated median PFS was 4.2 months. This is 1 month shorter than the median 
PFS in the sorafenib pre-treated subgroup, although it is difficult to draw conclusions given the low 
patient numbers.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically significant benefit in overall survival for advanced HCC patients treated with cabozantinib 
as compared to placebo has been reported in the pivotal phase 3 study (CELESTIAL). This is further 
supported by a beneficial PFS outcome. Uncertainties remain with respect to extrapolation of the 
beneficial effect of cabozantinib over placebo to the population to be treated in the clinic, which is 
expected to be more heterogeneous and include more frail patients.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety summary mainly details the data from the HCC patients in the Phase 3 Study XL184-309,

Data were pooled from Studies XL184-309, XL184-308 and A031203 for exposure, demographics, and 
adverse events (all Grade, Grade 3/4, Grade 5, SAEs, related SAEs and events to monitor [ETMs]). 
Laboratory results, vital signs and AEs leading to reductions, interruptions or modifications were not 
collected for Study A031203; for these pooled data from Studies XL184-309 and XL184-308 were 
presented.  
A summary of safety results for 41 subjects in the HCC cohort of Study XL184-203 RDT (completion 
date 30 May 2013) who were assigned a higher dose of 100-mg cabozantinib (as development-stage 
capsules) was provided separately.  
Patient exposure 
In Study XL184-309, the median duration of cabozantinib exposure was 3.8 months [range 0.1, 37.3] 
compared with 2.0 months [range 0.0, 27.2] for placebo. At the data cut-off, 16% of subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm and 11% of subjects in the placebo arm remained on treatment. There was a higher 
rate in the cabozantinib arm of treatment discontinuation due to AEs (cabozantinib 21% vs placebo 
5%), including AEs related to study treatment (16% vs 3%). 
The assigned dose of study treatment was 60 mg with two dose reductions permitted (to 40 mg, then 
20 mg) to manage AEs. The median relative dose intensity was 60% for the cabozantinib arm 
compared with 98% for the matched placebo arm. The median average daily cabozantinib dose was 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mg. At the assigned dose, 62% of cabozantinib-treated subjects had a dose reduction due to an AE 
(13% in the placebo arm); 33% of cabozantinib-treated subjects had a second dose reduction (3.0% 
in the placebo arm). As allowed in the protocol, 9 subjects re-escalated study treatment from 40 mg to 
60 mg.  
The median time to first cabozantinib dose reduction was 38 days and the median time to second 
cabozantinib dose reduction was 83 days. The final dose of cabozantinib (excluding dose interruptions) 
was distributed between the 3 dose levels (60 mg: 39% of subjects, 40 mg: 28%, 20 mg: 33%). The 
last cabozantinib dose level received (including dose interruptions was): 60mg- 15% of subjects; 40mg 
– 12%; 20mg – 13%; 0mg – 59%.  
The median time on treatment (excluding dose interruptions) for the three respective dose levels was 
28, 33 and 73 days. The median time to the first dose interruption was 28.0 days in the cabozantinib 
arm, and to the second dose interruption was 70.0 days. The median duration of each dose 
interruption was 9.0 days in the cabozantinib arm, and the median total duration of dose interruptions 
was 25.0 days.

The median cabozantinib exposure in the pooled population (XL184-309, XL184-308 and A031203) 
was longer - 5.6 months - and the median daily dose was higher - 41mg. 
In the HCC cohort of the Phase 2 Study XL184-203 RDT, subjects received cabozantinib at a starting 
dose of 100 mg qd (freebase equivalent, development stage capsule formulation). The median 
treatment exposure for HCC subjects in the Continuous Cabozantinib Data Set was 89.0 days (range: 
23 to 463 days). Over half (58.5%) underwent at least one dose reduction to 60mg due to AEs and 
24.4% underwent at least a second level dose reduction to 40mg.  Only 7.3% of subjects underwent 
further dose reductions to 20 mg qd. The median average daily cabozantinib dose was 65.7 mg, 
corresponding to a median dose intensity of 65.7%. 
Adverse events 
The overall incidence of any grade AEs was 99% in the cabozantinib arm and 92% in the placebo arm; 
reflecting the burden of advanced HCC and underlying liver disease in this patient population.

Two AEs reported for subjects in the cabozantinib arm could not be coded in MedDRA: Grade 2 AE (verbatim term “hypofosfatomy”) 
and Grade 4 SAE (verbatim term “respiratory crisis”). Subjects are counted only once in each category but may be counted in 
multiple categories. 
a 12 additional subjects (8 cabozantinib, 4 placebo) had Grade 5 AEs that were reported outside of the safety observation period. 
The preferred terms for these events in the cabozantinib arm were pneumonia general physical health deterioration hepatocellular 
carcinoma pneumothorax, and oesophageal varices haemorrhage. The preferred terms for these events in the placebo arm were 
lymphangiosis carcinomatosa  and hepatic failure. 
b Grade 5 AEs were not necessarily reported for subject deaths due to PD. 
c Subjects could be assessed as having more than one AE that led to treatment discontinuation with differing causalities. The total 
proportion of subjects with an AE leading to treatment discontinuation may not equal the sum of the related and not related AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation for a given treatment arm. 
d In Table 4, 3 subjects (2 cabozantinib, 1 placebo) were summarized as discontinuing study treatment due to 
AE who were not summarized as having AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (not related to PD) in this 
table: Cabozantinib arm: Subject (blood bilirubin increased, Grade 2) and Subject (fatigue, 
Grade 3). Placebo arm: Subject (pulmonary haemorrhage, Grade 2). 
The most frequent AEs (≥20% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib arm were 
diarrhoea, decreased appetite, PPES, fatigue, nausea, hypertension, vomiting, increased AST and 
asthenia. For subjects in the placebo arm, the most frequent AEs were fatigue and abdominal pain.  
Adverse events that occurred at a ≥ 10% higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared with the 
placebo arm were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome [PPES] (cabozantinib arm 46%, 
placebo arm 5.1%), diarrhoea (54%, 19%), decreased appetite (48%, 18%), hypertension (29%, 
5.9%), dysphonia (19%, 2.1%), fatigue (45%, 30%), asthenia (22%, 7.6%), vomiting (26%, 12%), 
nausea (31%, 18%), mucosal inflammation (14%, 2.1%), ALT increased (17%, 5.5%), weight 
decreased (17%, 5.9%), AST increased (22%, 11%), stomatitis (13%, 2.1%), and thrombocytopenia 
(11%, 0.4%).

Incidence in the Cabozantinib Arm) (Safety Population) 
The incidence of frequent AEs of any grade in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-309 was generally 
consistent with that observed in the pooled population. Diarrhoea, fatigue, decreased appetite, and 
PPES were the most frequent any grade AEs in the pooled population and the cabozantinib arm of 
XL184-309.

At each level of subject summarization, a subject is counted once for the most severe event if the subject reported one or more 
events. Denominators for percentages are N, the total number of subjects in each treatment arm. 
Treatment related AEs (all grades) that had a ≥ 10% higher per-subject incidence in the cabozantinib 
arm compared with placebo were PPES (cabozantinib 46%, placebo 4.6%), diarrhoea (46%, 12%), 
decreased appetite (37%, 9.7%), hypertension (27%, 3.0%), fatigue (38%, 19%), nausea (25%, 
7.6%), dysphonia (16%, 1.3%), vomiting (17%, 3.0%), mucosal inflammation (13%, 1.7%), and 
stomatitis (13%, 1.7%). 
Severity of AEs 
More Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in the cabozantinib arm (68% cabozantinib vs 36% placebo), chiefly 
due to the higher incidence of PPES (17% vs 0%) and hypertension (16% vs 1.7%). The most 
frequent Grade 3/4 AEs (≥  5% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib arm in descending 
order of incidence were PPES, hypertension, increased AST, fatigue, diarrhoea, asthenia and decreased 
appetite. In the placebo arm, the most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs (≥  5% incidence) in descending order 
were increased AST and anaemia. 
The overall incidence of Grade 4 AEs was 9.9% in the cabozantinib arm and 2.5% in the placebo arm. 
Grade 4 AEs reported for ≥  1% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm were increased γ-
glutamyltransferase (GGT) (cabozantinib 1.3%, placebo 0.4%) and hypomagnesemia (1.1%, 0%).  
Table 41: Study XL184-309: Summary of Frequent Grade 3/4 Adverse Events (≥ 2% Incidence in the 
Cabozantinib Arm; Safety Population) 
a One reported Grade 4 AE for a subject in the cabozantinib arm could not be coded in MedDRA at the time of the database snapshot 
(verbatim term “respiratory crisis”). 
The incidence of frequent Grade 3/4 AEs in the cabozantinib arm of XL184-309 was generally 
consistent with that observed in the pooled population. However, certain Grade 3/4 AEs reported in ≥ 
2% of subjects in the pooled population are associated with advanced HCC and occurred primarily in 
subjects from Study XL184-309: increased AST, general physical health deterioration, increased GGT, 
ascites, increased blood bilirubin and decreased platelet count. Of these events, only AST increased 
(4.9%, 2.1%), general physical health deterioration (4.5%, 2.5%) and platelet count decreased 
(3.6%, 0.8%) had a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm vs placebo arm in Study XL184-
309. Thrombocytopaenia (3.4% vs. 0%) was reported separately from decreased platelet count. 
ADRs for inclusion in the SmPC 
 
The ADRs for inclusion in the SmPC were determined from review of the safety data for each pivotal 
study (2L RCC, 1L RCC and 2L HCC) and pooled data (across the RCC and HCC studies) as follows: 
An initial screen involved AE frequency ≥10% in the cabozantinib arm (regardless of severity), AE 
frequency ≥5% difference between study treatment arms (regardless of severity), AE frequency ≥2% 
difference between study treatment arms for AEs with CTC Grade ≥3, laboratory parameter shifts 
representing a shift ≥2 CTCAE Grades between study treatment arms and EMA-defined designated 
medical events, irrespective of observed AE frequency. 
This subset of identified adverse events was further evaluated using Bradford-Hill criteria, medical 
judgment and other information from pre-clinical, other clinical trials, post -marketing and literature 
sources.  Then, the ADR frequency was defined by the observed number and percentage of subjects 
who experienced the treatment-emergent adverse event irrespective of reported causality.

Deaths 
The incidence of all deaths in Study XL184-309 up to the 01 June 2017 cut-off date was 314 (67%) in 
the cabozantinib arm and 167 (70%) in the placebo arm. 
The incidence of deaths up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug was similar in each arm: 
57 (12%) subjects in the cabozantinib vs 28 (12%) in the placebo arm. Deaths were attributed to PD 
for 30 subjects (6.4%) and 21 subjects (8.9%) and to other reasons for 27 subjects (5.8%) and 7 
subjects (3.0%), respectively, in the cabozantinib and placebo arms.  
Table 43: Study XL184-309: Summary of Deaths through 30 Days after Last Dose of Study Treatment 
(Safety population) 
a Two of the deaths in the cabozantinib arm occurred outside of the AE observation period 
Associated all-causality non-PD-related Grade 5 AEs that occurred in more than one subject in the 
cabozantinib arm were hepatic failure (5 subjects), multi-organ failure (2 subjects), and oesophageal 
varices haemorrhage (2 subjects) [and, in 1 subject each, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, completed suicide, death, oesophagobronchial fistula, hepatorenal 
syndrome, intracranial tumour haemorrhage, ischaemic hepatitis, ischemic stroke, liver disorder, 
metastases to lung, portal vein thrombosis, prerenal failure, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, 
sepsis, tumour haemorrhage, and upper GI haemorrhage].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Grade 5 AE in the placebo arm was hepatic failure (2 subjects) [and, in 1 subject each, death, 
biliary sepsis, intestinal perforation, pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia]. 
A summary of pooled Grade 5 AEs up until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment for the 
cabozantinib arm of Studies XL184-309, XL184-308 and A031203 is presented below. These were 
generally associated with the disease under study and comprised HCC, RCC, hepatic failure (all events 
in HCC subjects), death, general physical health deterioration, metastases to lung, metastatic RCC and 
oesophageal varices haemorrhage (both events in HCC subjects). The remaining Grade 5 AE PTs up to 
30 days after the last dose occurred in 1 subject each.

There was an additional subject who died of jejunal perforation in Study A031202 (Grade 5 AE related 
to study treatment). He had a history of pancreatic metastases and a jejunal mass eroding adjacent 
bowel.  
A total of 396 deaths occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment: 257 
(55%) in the cabozantinib arm and 139 (59%) in the placebo arm. Most of these deaths were due to 
PD; 228 (49%) subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 119 (50%) subjects in the placebo arm. 
In the cabozantinib arm, 20 subjects (4.3%) had Grade 5 AEs that occurred more than 30 days after 
the last dose. Ten events were attributed to HCC and 10 Grade 5 non-PD AEs were reported per 
Investigator: general physical health deterioration (n=3), cerebrovascular accident, hepatic cirrhosis, 
hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic failure, lung infection, pneumonia and staphylococcal sepsis (1 each). 
In the placebo arm, 6 subjects (2.5%) had Grade 5 AEs that occurred more than 30 days after the last 
dose. Four events were attributed to HCC and 2 Grade 5 non-PD AEs were reported: chronic hepatic 
failure and hepatorenal syndrome.  
None of the Grade 5 AEs in either treatment arm was assessed as related to study treatment. 
Grade 5 events more than 30 days after the last dose that occurred in more than 1 subject in the 
pooled population were associated with the disease under study and comprised HCC, RCC and general 
physical health deterioration. The remaining Grade 5 AE PTs more than 30 days after the last dose 
occurred in 1 subject each. None of these events were assessed as related to study treatment.  
Serious Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of SAEs was 50% in the cabozantinib arm and 37% in the placebo arm. 
The most frequent SAEs (≥  2% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib arm were: HCC, 
general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites and dyspnoea.  
 
 
The most frequent SAEs (≥ 2% incidence) reported for subjects in the placebo arm were: HCC, 
abdominal pain, general physical health deterioration, hepatic failure, pneumonia and oesophageal 
varices haemorrhage. The nature of the most frequent SAEs was generally similar for both treatment 
arms.  
Hepatic encephalopathy was observed at higher incidence in the cabozantinib (3.2%) than in the 
placebo arm (0.4%). 
GI perforations were reported in 0.9% of cabozantinib-treated patients (4/467). All events were Grade 
3 or 4. Median time to onset was 5.9 weeks. 
Table 45: Study XL184-309: Summary of Frequent Serious Adverse Events (≥ 1% Incidence in the 
Either Treatment Arm; Safety Population) 
 a There was 1 un-coded serious adverse event reported in 1 subject in the cabozantinib arm: ‘respiratory crisis’. 
The overall incidence of related SAEs was 18% (n=82) in the cabozantinib arm and 5.9% (n=14) in 
the placebo arm. No related SAEs were reported for ≥2% of subjects in either arm.  
Related SAEs that had a ≥ 1% higher per-subject incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared with 
placebo (all 0%) were hepatic encephalopathy (cabozantinib n=7, 1.5%), PPES (n=6, 1.3%), asthenia 
(n=5, 1.1%) and diarrhoea (n=5, 1.1%). 
 
In the placebo arm, treatment-related SAEs of haemoptysis and vomiting were reported in 2 subjects 
(0.8%) each; all other reported SAEs occurred in 1 subject each.

The most frequent SAEs in the pooled population included events associated with the disease under 
study (HCC [4.5%] and general physical health deterioration [2.4%]). Pneumonia was a frequent SAE 
in the pooled population [2.5%], with most events occurring in Study XL184-309; although the 
incidence was similar in the cabozantinib and placebo arms of that study (3.4 vs 2.5%).  
Additionally, certain SAEs that are associated with advanced HCC were observed at ≥1% incidence in 
the pooled population and occurred primarily in subjects of Study XL184-309: hepatic encephalopathy 
and ascites. Diarrhoea (n=15, 1.7%), hypertension (10, 1.1%) and PPES (10, 1.1%) were the most 
frequent treatment-related SAEs in the pooled population.  
 
Table 47: Pooled Studies XL184-309, XL184-308, and A031203: Summary of Frequent Serious Adverse 
Events (≥ 1% Incidence; Safety Population) 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction 
In HCC Study XL184-309, there was a higher incidence of all-grade AEs leading to dose reduction in 
the cabozantinib arm relative to placebo (64% vs 13%). The most frequent AEs leading to dose 
reduction occurring in ≥5% of cabozantinib-treated subjects by decreasing frequency were PPES, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, hypertension and increased AST. 
  
Table 48: Study XL184-309: Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction (≥ 5% Incidence in 
the Cabozantinib Arm; Safety Population) 
Denominators for percentages are N, the total number of subjects in each treatment arm.  
Data from the AE CRF with respect to action taken with study drug differ slightly from the dose reduction summaries based upon the 
Study Treatment CRF, and these minor differences were not reconciled. 
In RCC Study XL184-308, the incidence of all-grade AEs leading to cabozantinib dose reduction was 
60%, most frequently diarrhoea, PPES and fatigue. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruption 
The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was 84% in the cabozantinib arm versus 38% in the 
placebo arm. Adverse events that led to interruptions, including those for which treatment never 
resumed, are included in this summary; these events are included in the summary of AEs that led to 
study treatment discontinuation if relevant.  
Table 49: Study XL184-309: Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruption (≥ 5% Incidence in 
the Cabozantinib Arm; Safety Population) 
Data from the AE CRF with respect to action taken with study drug differ slightly from the dose interruption summaries based upon 
the Study Treatment CRF, and these minor differences were not reconciled. 
The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption per AE CRF was higher in the cabozantinib arm of 
Study XL184-309 (84%) than Study XL184-308 (70%). This included AEs of PPES (25% vs. 14%) and 
 
 
 
increased AST (9.4% vs. 1.8%). Diarrhoea, PPES and fatigue were among the most frequent AEs 
leading to dose interruption in both studies.   
In HCC Study XL184-309, there was a higher incidence of all-grade AEs leading to dose modification 
(reduction or interruption) in the cabozantinib arm relative to placebo (89% vs 40%). In RCC Study 
XL184-308, the incidence of all-grade AEs leading to dose modification was 77% in the cabozantinib 
arm. The somewhat higher incidence of AEs leading to cabozantinib dose modification in Study XL184-
309 relative to Study XL184-308 may be explained by the higher incidence of events of PPES and AST 
increased. 
Other Clinically Significant Adverse Events and Events to Monitor (ETM) 
Hepatobiliary Disorders SOC  
Adverse events in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC were reported at a similar incidence in the 2 
treatment arms: 12% in the cabozantinib and 14% in the placebo arm. The most frequent AEs (≥ 1% 
incidence, any grade, either arm) were: hyperbilirubinemia (cabozantinib 2.4%, placebo 3.4%), 
hepatic failure (1.9%, 3.4%), jaundice (1.9%, 3.4%), portal vein thrombosis (1.3%, 0%) and hepatic 
pain (0%, 1.3%). 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC were reported for 6.2% of subjects in the 
cabozantinib and 8.4% of subjects in the placebo arm. The most frequent Grade 3 or 4 AEs (≥  1% 
incidence, either arm) were hyperbilirubinemia (cabozantinib 1.3%, placebo 2.1%), portal vein 
thrombosis (1.1%, 0%) and hepatic failure (0.4%, 2.5%). 
In the cabozantinib arm, 11 subjects (2.4%) experienced Grade 5 AEs from the hepatobiliary disorders 
SOC: hepatic failure (6 subjects), portal vein thrombosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis, 
ischemic hepatitis, and liver disorder (1 subject each). Three were considered related to study 
treatment (hepatic failure, hepatorenal syndrome and portal vein thrombosis, as described previously) 
and 8 were considered unrelated. These subjects had extrahepatic tumour spread and/ or 
macrovascular invasion (n=8), had been heavily pre-treated [multiple TACE (n=4); SIRT (n=1); RFA 
(n=1); hepatectomy/ lobectomy/ segmentectomy (n=3)] and/ or had an ECOG PS of 1 (n=3).  
In the placebo arm, 4 subjects (1.7%) experienced Grade 5 hepatobiliary events: hepatic failure (2 
subjects), hepatorenal syndrome and chronic hepatic failure (1 subject each). One hepatic failure AE 
was considered treatment related, as described previously.  
AEs of hepatic encephalopathy and oesophageal varices haemorrhage are associated with progression 
of liver disease but are not reported in the primary SOC of hepatobiliary disorders. 
Hepatic Encephalopathy 
Hepatic encephalopathy (any grade) was reported for 19 subjects (4.1%) in the cabozantinib and 3 
subjects (1.3%) in the placebo arm. Most events were not considered to be related to study treatment 
by the Investigator: related AEs of hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8 (1.7%) and 1 (0.4%) 
subjects, respectively.  
All-causality Grade 3 or 4 events were reported for 13 subjects (2.8%) and 2 subjects (0.8%), 
respectively. In addition, one subject in the cabozantinib arm had a Grade 5 event (4403-3510) 43 
days after last dose of study drug, which the Investigator considered was due to progressive disease.  
All 19 subjects in the cabozantinib arm with treatment-emergent hepatic encephalopathy had 
predisposing baseline and/or postbaseline factors that potentially contributed to the occurrence of 
hepatic encephalopathy: 
- 11 had a history of cirrhosis prior to enrolment (baseline cirrhosis status was not solicited per CRF) 
- 2 were Child-Pugh B at baseline 
- 2 had a prior history of hepatic encephalopathy 
- 3 had hepatic encephalopathy onset more than 30 days after their last dose of study treatment 
- 5 had hepatic encephalopathy onset before steady-state cabozantinib plasma concentrations were 
likely to have been reached (i.e. 15 days from first dose of study treatment) 
- 1 had hepatic encephalopathy onset the same day that the subject “abused alcohol” 
- 12 had AEs or laboratory abnormalities that could contribute to the development of hepatic 
encephalopathy per AASLD guidelines (constipation, electrolyte disorders, GI haemorrhage and 
infection) within 14 days before the first onset of hepatic encephalopathy  
- 10 had AEs that could contribute to the development of electrolyte imbalances or fluid shifts 
(vomiting, diarrhoea or decreased appetite) within 14 days before the first onset of hepatic 
encephalopathy 
Seven of the 19 subjects continued to receive cabozantinib at a reduced dose for at least 30 days after 
the initial onset of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Encephalopathy AEs of any grade were reported at a higher incidence in the cabozantinib compared 
with the placebo arm (8 subjects [1.7%] and 1 subject [0.4%], respectively). Encephalopathy was 
considered related in 4 (0.9%) and 0 subjects, respectively. All-causality Grade 3 events were reported 
for 3 (0.6%) and 1 subject (0.4%), respectively; no Grade 4 or 5 events were reported. 
Encephalopathy as an SAE was reported for 1 subject (0.2%) in the cabozantinib arm and no subjects 
in the placebo arm.  
All 8 subjects in the cabozantinib arm, who had treatment-emergent encephalopathy, had predisposing 
baseline and/or postbaseline factors that potentially contributed to the development of 
encephalopathy, including: a history of cirrhosis (n=3); a gastric ulcer bleed with a ligation procedure 
(n=1); concomitant CNS depressants, lorazepam and oxycodone (n=1); “massive” tumour progression 
(n=1); potentially contributory AEs or laboratory abnormalities within 14 days before the first onset of 
encephalopathy -  constipation, electrolyte disorders, GI haemorrhage and infection (n=7) or AEs 
possibly leading to electrolyte imbalances or fluid shifts within 14 days before the first onset of 
encephalopathy - vomiting, diarrhoea or decreased appetite (n=6).   
Three of the 8 cabozantinib subjects who experienced treatment- emergent encephalopathy continued 
to receive study treatment for at least 30 days after AE onset. 
Events to Monitor (ETMs) 
A series of ETMs were defined based on groupings of AE PTs known to be associated with VEGFR-TKIs 
Table 50:  XL184-309: Incidence of Events to Monitor (Safety Analysis Set) 
PPES, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome; RPLS, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (preferred term: 
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES]).  
At each level of summarization, a subject was counted once for the most severe event if the subject reported one or more events. 
a Only Haemorrhage ETM events with severity ≥  Grade 3 are summarized. 
b The following were not captured as arterial thrombotic events: ischaemic hepatitis (Grade 5), intestinal ischaemia (Grade 4) and 
peripheral ischaemia (Grade 4) in the cabozantinib arm (one subject each); ischaemic hepatitis (Grade 4) and myocardial ischaemia 
(Grade 3) in the placebo arm (one subject each). Including these subjects, the overall incidence of all-grade ATEs was 15 (3.2%) in 
the cabozantinib arm and 5 (2.1%) in the placebo arm; Grade ≥ 3 ATEs was 12 (2.6%) vs 3 (1.3%). 
c, d Per CTCAE v4, there are no events of PPES or proteinuria with severity > Grade 3. 
Most ETMs occurred at a higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared to the placebo arm, 
except osteonecrosis and RPLS, which did not occur in either treatment arm.  
In line with what is known about the safety profile of cabozantinib in approved indications, the 
incidences of grade 3/4 thromboembolic events, hypertension, PPES, and diarrhoea, were higher in the 
cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-309 compared to placebo. 
Grade ≥ 3 Haemorrhage: 
Clinically relevant haemorrhage events occurred at a similar frequency in both treatment arms (7.3% 
cabozantinib vs 7.2% placebo). The incidence of ≥Grade 3 AEs of oesophageal varices haemorrhage 
was also similar in each arm (1.5% vs 2.1%). However, five subjects in the cabozantinib arm had a 
Grade 5 haemorrhage event. One event (upper GI haemorrhage, as discussed in the section on 
deaths) was assessed as related to treatment by the Investigator. Median time to onset was 9.1 
weeks. 
 
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): 
VTE (all grades) occurred in 4.9% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with 2.5% in the 
placebo arm, including portal vein thrombosis (1.3% vs 0%), deep vein thrombosis (0.9% vs 0%) and 
pulmonary embolism (1.5% vs 2.1%).  
Two subjects in the cabozantinib arm had a Grade 5 VTE (pulmonary embolism and portal vein 
thrombosis); both events were deemed related to study treatment by the Investigator.  
The incidence of VTEs in the cabozantinib arm was higher in subjects that had extrahepatic spread 
and/or macrovascular invasion at baseline than in subjects that did not (5.6% vs 1.4%), which was 
mainly due to the incidence of portal vein thrombosis (3.2% vs 0.6%). Among the 6 cabozantinib 
subjects who experienced portal vein thrombosis, 4 had a history of portal vein tumour invasion prior 
to randomization. In the placebo arm, no notable difference in the incidence of VTEs was observed 
based on whether the subjects had extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion at baseline.  
Arterial Thromboembolism (ATE): 
If all events, including ischaemic events were captured, the incidence of ATE (all grades) in the 
cabozantinib and placebo arms was 3.2% vs 2.1%; the incidence of ≥  Grade 3 ATEs was 2.6% vs 
1.3%. Two subjects in the cabozantinib arm had Grade 5 ATEs, neither of which was deemed related 
to study treatment by the Investigator:  
ischemic stroke; 66-year-old male with a history of smoking, hypertension and sleep apnoea, 
cerebrovascular accident; 57-year-old male who was hospitalized in a confusional state following an 
overdose of zolpidem; the subject experienced “inhalation bronchopneumopathy” and, on Study Day 
43, developed secondary hepatic failure followed by the cerebrovascular accident on Study Day 68, 
approximately 38 days after last dose of study drug.  
In addition, one subject had Grade 5 ischaemic hepatitis deemed related to study treatment by the 
Investigator; 66-year-old male with a history of smoking, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, chronic gastritis, 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The subject had undergone prior segmentectomy and Cyberknife 
to liver; the subject was hospitalized due to gastric varices haemorrhage and ischaemic hepatitis, an 
increased risk for bleeding was evidenced by elevated PT and INR values; the subject died three days 
later. This was not captured in the section on deaths. The applicant confirmed that this was 
erroneously attributed to study therapy when the investigator assessed the haemorrhage and 
ischaemic hepatitis as due to underlying cirrhosis.   
QT Prolongation: 
A non-serious Grade 3 AE of QT prolongation occurred in one subject in the cabozantinib arm 
concurrent with Grade 2 hypokalaemia; the subject had Investigator-assessed triplicate average QTcF 
of > 500 ms, but, per independent central review, was determined to not exceed a triplicate average 
of 440 ms. 
In addition, one subject had a Grade 1 AE of QT prolongation and another subject had Grade 1 AE of 
QT abnormal.  
Events of Torsades de pointes have not been reported in any cabozantinib study, or in the post-
marketing setting. The potential risk of QT prolongation is unlikely to be clinically significant. 
Time to Event 
There was a relatively early median onset for the more frequent ETMs: hypertension (2.1 weeks), 
PPES (3.1 weeks) and diarrhoea (4.1 weeks). The median time to first occurrence was longer for 
clinically significant but less frequent events: approximately 6 weeks for intra-abdominal and pelvic 
abscesses and GI perforations; 7 weeks for wound complications; and 9 weeks for VTEs, ATEs and ≥ 
Grade 3 haemorrhages and 14 weeks for fistulas. 
Gastrointestinal perforation, fistulas, haemorrhage, thromboembolic events, wound complications, 
hypertension, PPES, proteinuria and RPLS are described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the 
Cabometyx SmPC.  
Table 51: Pooled Studies XL184-309, XL184-308, and A031203: Incidence of Events to Monitor (Safety 
Population) Study XL184-309  
a One subject in Study A031203 experienced a Grade 4 AE of jejunal perforation; follow-up information indicated that the 
Investigator later re-assessed the cause of death as jejunal perforation (Grade 5 AE). This subject is counted in the “Grade 5”and 
excluded from the “Grade 3/4” column.  
b For the Haemorrhage ETM, this cell summarizes subject-incidence of events of ≥  Grade 3 only. 
c Count includes 5 additional subjects who experienced the following events that were not captured as arterial thrombotic events in 
SCS, ISS Table 6.1: Study XL184-309 (1 subject each): ischemic hepatitis (Grade 5); intestinal ischemia (Grade 4); and peripheral 
ischemia (Grade 4).  Study A031203 (1 subject): stroke, thrombosis of axillary artery, and thrombosis of the left internal carotid 
artery (unknown grades; counted in “Any Grade” column). Study XL184-308 (1 subject): peripheral ischemia (Grade 3).  
d Count includes 10 additional subjects in Study A031203 who experienced events that were not captured as a VTE in 
SCS, ISS Table 6.1: 2 subjects had Grade 4 events, 5 subjects had Grade 3 events, and 3 subjects had Grade 2 events. 
e Per CTCAE v4, there are no events of PPES or proteinuria with severity > Grade 3. 
Laboratory findings 
Serum Chemistry 
The most frequent (≥40%) treatment-emergent serum chemistry laboratory abnormalities (all grades) 
reported in the cabozantinib arm by decreasing frequency were increased lactose dehydrogenase 
 
(LDH), increased ALT, increased AST, decreased albumin, increased glucose, increased alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) and decreased sodium. Abnormalities with a ≥5% higher per-subject incidence in 
the cabozantinib compared with the placebo arm were: LDH increased (84% vs 29%), ALT increased 
(73% vs 37%), AST increased (73% vs 46%), albumin decreased (51% vs. 32%), ALP increased (43% 
vs. 38%), phosphate decreased (25% vs. 8.4%), potassium decreased (23% vs. 6.3%), magnesium 
decreased (22% vs. 2.5%), amylase increased (16% vs. 8.9%), and corrected calcium decreased 
(7.7% vs. 0%).  
The incidence of all-grade increases in ALT and AST was higher in the cabozantinib arm relative to 
placebo; however, there was a similar incidence of increased bilirubin (38% vs 34%; Grade 3/4 6.9% 
vs 7.6%) and ALP (43% vs 38%) and a lower incidence of increased GGT (28% vs 40%). 
The incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, often associated with diarrhoea and vomiting, was higher in 
the cabozantinib arm relative to placebo including decreases in phosphate, potassium, magnesium and 
corrected calcium. The difference in the incidence of Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities was less 
marked: decreased phosphate (8.8% vs 3.8%), potassium (5.6% vs 1.3%), magnesium (3.2% vs 0%) 
and calcium (1.7% vs 0%). 
There was a similar incidence of all-grade creatinine elevations in either arm (8.6% vs 7.2%).  
Haematology 
The most frequent (≥  40%) treatment-emergent haematology abnormalities (all grades) reported in 
the cabozantinib arm by decreasing frequency were decreased platelets, white blood cell count (WBC) 
and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). 
Haematology abnormalities (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% higher per-subject incidence in the 
cabozantinib compared with the placebo arm were decreased platelets (54% vs 16%), decreased WBC 
(51% vs 13%), decreased ANC (43% vs 8.4%) and increased haemoglobin (7.7% vs 0.8%). The 
corresponding Grade 3 or 4 incidence was decreased platelets (cabozantinib 10% vs placebo 1.3%), 
decreased WBC (4.9% vs 0.8%), decreased ANC (6.9% vs 1.3%) and increased haemoglobin (0% in 
each arm). The incidence of decreased haemoglobin was similar in both arms (32% vs 29%) and 
Grade 3/4 (4.1% vs 4.2%).  
The incidence of all-grade haematology abnormalities in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-309 was 
generally consistent with that observed in the pooled population; however, the incidence of decreased 
platelets was somewhat higher in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-309 than the pooled population 
(54% vs 42%). 
Thyroid Function 
Of the subjects with normal baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) 
levels, 15% (52/350) in the cabozantinib arm and 3% (5/191) in the placebo arm had post-baseline 
increased TSH with normal FT4 (subclinical hypothyroidism). A further 1.4% (5/350) in the 
cabozantinib arm and 0% (0/191) in the placebo arm had post-baseline increased TSH with FT4 
decreased (clinical hypothyroidism).  
The effect of concomitant thyroid hormone replacement therapy has not been evaluated, so AE 
reporting may better reflect the incidence of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism as an AE was reported in 
8.1% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and in 0.4% in the placebo arm. In addition, two subjects in 
the cabozantinib arm had related AEs of thyroiditis (Grades 1 and 2); both had received prior 
sorafenib. 
The incidence of subclinical and clinical hypothyroidism was similar in the cabozantinib arm of Study 
XL184-309 and in the pooled population (11% and 1.4%). 
Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio (UPCR) 
Sponsor-defined UPCR grades were: Grade 1 (≥  0.15 to ≤  1.0 mg/mg), Grade 2 (> 1.0 to ≤  3.5 
mg/mg) and Grade 3 (> 3.5 mg/mg). 
Treatment-emergent UPCR laboratory abnormalities, mostly Grade 1 or 2, occurred in 45% of subjects 
in the cabozantinib arm and 30% in the placebo arm; Grade 3 abnormalities occurred in 2.6% of 
cabozantinib-treated subjects (1.7% placebo).  
A ≥ 2-grade postbaseline worsening from Grade 0 at baseline occurred in 26 (5.6%) of subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm and 2 (0.8%) in the placebo arm. A 2-grade postbaseline worsening from Grade 1 at 
baseline occurred in 7 (1.5%) of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 3 (1.5%) in the placebo arm. 
The most frequent corresponding AE was proteinuria (also documented via dipstick), which occurred in 
3.6% of cabozantinib-treated subjects (0.4% placebo); 1.5% of cabozantinib-treated subjects (0.4% 
placebo) had Grade 3 AEs. The incidence of proteinuria may have been affected by subjects’ prior 
treatment with sorafenib. Cases meeting screening criteria for potential drug-related renal dysfunction 
The incidence of UPCR abnormalities in the cabozantinib arm of XL184-309 was similar to that in the 
pooled population. 
Screening for Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) 
Blinded laboratory data listings were reviewed by the Sponsor quarterly for potential cases of DILI as 
identified by ALT, AST and bilirubin levels (Hy’s Law laboratory criteria). Elevated ALP levels were not 
used to rule out DILI in cases where the baseline ALP was high or confounding factors were present 
(e.g. bone metastases). The study IDMC reviewed unblinded safety data and was asked to assess for 
potential DILI in the context of baseline reduced liver function. 
Table 52: Summary of Treatment-Emergent Liver Function Test Abnormalities (Safety Population) 
Considers worst value after first dose for each abnormality per subject. Laboratory results from both central and 
local laboratories are included. 
In total, 79 subjects (49 in the cabozantinib arm, 30 in the placebo arm) met the laboratory screening 
criteria (concurrent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN, total bilirubin > 2 × ULN).  Of these, the proportion with 
ALP < 2 × ULN was similar in both treatment arms (cabozantinib, 20 subjects [4.3%]; placebo, 8 
subjects [3.4%]). No subjects identified through laboratory screening were deemed to be potentially 
indicative of DILI following medical review. 
There were no confirmed cases of DILI in Study XL184-308. 
Laboratory Screening Criteria for Potential Drug-Related Renal Dysfunction 
The proportion of subjects who met routine screening criteria for potential drug-related renal 
dysfunction was similar in both treatment arms of Study XL184-309. 
 
 
Table 53: Study XL184-309: Summary of Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Test Abnormalities 
(Safety Population) 
The following relevant SAEs occurred: 
- 
- 
cabozantinib arm: Grade 5 renal failure; Grade 5 prerenal failure; Grade 3 acute renal failure 
and Grade 1 acute renal failure 
placebo arm: Grade 3 renal failure; Grade 4 acute renal failure and Grade 2 acute renal failure  
There were no nephrotic syndrome events in either arm.  
Transfusions 
Fifty-two subjects (11%) in the cabozantinib arm and 20 subjects (8.4%) in the placebo arm had at 
least one transfusion, most frequently packed red blood cells (cabozantinib 8.4%, placebo 5.9%). 
Weight Loss 
In Study XL184-309, 28% of subjects in cabozantinib arm had ≥10% weight loss from baseline 
compared with 4.6% of subjects in the placebo arm. The incidence of the corresponding AE of weight 
decreased was 17% and 5.9%, respectively. The mechanism is unknown, but the higher incidence of 
GI events seen with cabozantinib treatment may contribute.  
Safety in special populations 
The incidence of AEs and ETMs in Study XL184-309 was summarized by subgroups based on intrinsic 
factors (sex, age group, race, weight, aetiology, extent of extrahepatic disease and baseline ECOG 
status) and extrinsic factors (number of prior systemic anticancer agents, geographic region).  
There were no marked treatment differences in safety noted for most subgroups. However, the small 
number of subjects in the Black/African American (1.7% cabozantinib, 4.6% placebo) and Other 
(8.4%, 5.9%) racial categories did not allow meaningful safety conclusions to be drawn for these 
subgroups. 
 
Table 54: XL184-309: ETMs by Age Group (Safety Population) 
a There were 5 subjects ≥  85 years old at baseline (cabozantinib arm). These subjects are not summarized in this 
table. 
Safety data were also summarized by age per EMA recommendations. No notable age-related 
differences in related AEs were observed for cabozantinib-treated subjects.

a These data represent an over-estimate of related AE episodes because a unique record is documented for every 
change in severity grade, up or down, even within a single AE episode. 
b Each subject is counted only once at each level of summarization. 
c Excludes AEs related to disease progression. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of study treatment discontinuation due to an AE regardless of causality 
(excluding AEs due to PD) was 98 subjects (21%) in the cabozantinib arm and 11 subjects (5%) in the 
placebo arm. 
The overall incidence of study treatment discontinuation due to a treatment-related AE (excluding AEs 
due to PD) was 76 subjects (16%) in the cabozantinib arm and 7 subjects (3%) in the placebo arm. 
Table 56: Adverse Events Not Related to Disease Progression that Led to Study Treatment 
Discontinuation in ≥ 1% of Subjects in Either Treatment Arm (Safety Population) 
At each level of subject summarization, a subject is counted once for the most severe event if the subject reported 
one or more events. 
a In the subject disposition table, three subjects (two cabozantinib and one placebo) were summarized as 
discontinuing study treatment due to AE who were not summarized as having AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation (not related to disease progression) in this table:  
Cabozantinib arm: Subject (blood bilirubin increased, Grade 2) and Subject (fatigue, Grade 3). 
Placebo arm: Subject (pulmonary haemorrhage, Grade 2). 
Adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation that were related to disease progression 
occurred in 17% and 16% of subjects in the cabozantinib and placebo arms, respectively (per 
Investigator as indicated on the AE CRF). Most frequently these were general physical health 
deterioration (cabozantinib 3.6%, placebo 1.7%), HCC (1.7%, 3.4%), ascites (1.3%, 1.7%) and 
fatigue (1.3%, 0.8%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety in the HCC Cohort of Study XL184-203 RDT 
Subjects received starting cabozantinib doses of 100 mg qd (freebase equivalent, development stage 
capsule formulation), and treatment-emergent toxicities were managed with dose interruptions and 
reductions. The permitted dose reduction levels were to 60 mg (first reduction) and 40 mg (second 
reduction).  
All subjects experienced at least one AE of any grade, and 78% of subjects experienced at least one ≥ 
Grade 3 AE. The most frequent ≥ Grade 3 AEs (≥10% incidence) were diarrhoea (22.0%), 
thrombocytopenia (17.1%), PPES (14.6%) and increased AST (12.2%). Grade 4 AEs were experienced 
by four subjects (9.8%): acute pancreatitis, hypoglycaemia, hyponatremia and back pain (1 subject 
each). One Grade 5 AE of hepatic failure (not related to study treatment) was reported. Two subjects 
met the screening criteria for Hy’s Law (including the subject that had the Grade 5 AE of hepatic 
failure), but medical review determined that neither case was clearly indicative of DILI. 
Table 57: XL184-203 RDT: Summary of Frequent Adverse Events (≥ 20%) for HCC Subjects (Continuous 
Cabozantinib Data Set, N=41) 
Three deaths were reported up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment for HCC subjects in the 
Continuous Cabozantinib Data Set; all were attributed to PD per Investigator, including a Grade 5 AE 
of hepatic failure.  
Fifteen subjects experienced 37 SAEs irrespective of causality; all the SAE PTs were reported for 1 or 2 
subjects and none led to study treatment discontinuation. The SAEs experienced by more than one 
subject were: asthenia, diarrhoea, hypoglycaemia and urinary tract infection. 
 
Overall, there were no additional safety signals observed in Phase 2 Study XL184-203 RDT compared 
with Phase 3 Study XL184-309. 
Post marketing experience 
The post-marketing population for cabozantinib (Cabometyx and Cometriq combined) up until 28 
November 2017 comprised a total of 10,565 patients exposed, including approximately 7507 in the US, 
2873 in the EU (946 marketed, 1927 named patient use [NPU] or managed access program [MAP]) 
and 167 from other countries (NPU/MAP and a global access program). 
Patients in the US received cabozantinib for treatment of RCC (n= 4232) and thyroid cancer (n= 878) 
as well as malignancies other than the approved indications, including HCC, prostate, lung, bone and 
brain. In the EU, information on treated indication is not available. 
Post-marketing serious adverse reactions (SARs) reported up to 28 November 2017: 
In 603 patients who received Cabometyx on-label for renal cancer 901 post-marketing SARs were 
received. The most frequent nonfatal SARs (excluding hospitalization) were diarrhoea (n=26), 
pneumonia (n=22), pulmonary embolism (n=21), thrombosis (n=19), nausea (n=15), dehydration, 
vomiting (each n=13), dyspnoea, hypertension, fatigue (each n=10), asthenia (n=9), malaise (n=8), 
decreased appetite, pain, cerebrovascular accident (each n=7), atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, 
and rash (each n=6).  
In the US 1739 patients received Cabometyx for a non-approved indication, including 20 for HCC; one 
of these HCC patients died due to an unknown cause of death. 
In 157 patients who received Cometriq on-label for the indication of thyroid cancer, 286 post-
marketing SARs were received. The most frequent non-fatal SARs included dehydration (n= 12), 
pneumonia (n=8), diarrhoea (n=7), dyspnoea (n=6), asthenia, pancreatitis, vomiting, hypotension 
and hypertension (each n=5).  
In the US 1283 patients have received Cometriq for a non-approved indication, including 25 for HCC; 4 
of these HCC patients experienced at least one SAR. The most frequent non-fatal SAR was chest pain 
(n=2). One patient reported SARs of portal vein thrombosis, sepsis, hypocalcaemia, pancytopenia, 
malnutrition and chest pain; one patient reported SARs of pulmonary embolism and decreased platelet 
count; one patient reported a single event of chest pain; and one patient reported an SAR of muscle 
spasms.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure  
Safety data were primarily from the placebo-controlled Phase 3 XL184-309 study in subjects with 
previously treated advanced HCC up to 01 June 2017, the data cut-off for the primary OS analysis.  
The median duration of exposure (including dose interruptions) was longer in the cabozantinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm (3.8 [1.1, 60.0] vs 2.0 [0.0, 27.2months], respectively), but shorter 
than the RCC population in trial XL184-308 (5.6 months). As discussed in the efficacy section, median 
cabozantinib exposure was shorter than the median PFS in the cabozantinib arm (5.2 months).  
The median dose intensity in HCC patients was 60%, corresponding to a median daily dose of 36 mg 
cabozantinib, lower than in the RCC trial population (45mg), and notably lower than the starting dose 
of 60mg. The recommended Cabometyx dose for patients with hepatic impairment prior to the current 
Phase 3 HCC study was 40mg. 
Dose modifications and Discontinuations 
Dose modifications were commonly required in conjunction with supportive care to manage AEs and 
occurred in 88% of cabozantinib – treated subjects (vs. 39% of placebo subjects), with dose 
reductions in 62% and dose interruptions in 84%. The median time to first cabozantinib dose 
modification was short – 38 days for dose reduction and 28 days to first dose interruption. The median 
time to the second dose reduction/ modification was longer (83 and 70 days, respectively), suggesting 
that AEs could be managed with dose modifications. The median number of dose interruptions per 
patient was 2 and the median duration was 9 days.  
The incidence of subjects with AEs leading to dose modification per AE CRF was higher and occurred 
earlier in the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-309 than the cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-308 
(76% with a median time to first dose modification of 36 days). 
The most frequent AEs leading to dose modification (PPES, diarrhoea, fatigue, hypertension, and AST 
increased), largely reflect the most frequently observed AEs for cabozantinib. Incidence of PPES and 
liver enzyme elevations (AST and ALT) leading to dose modification were higher in the cabozantinib 
arm of Study XL184-309 (28%, 10% and 6%, respectively) than in the cabozantinib arm of Study 
XL184-308 (16%, 3.0% and 3.9%, respectively).  
In the CELESTIAL study, thrombocytopenia and decreased platelets were reported. Platelet levels 
should be monitored during cabozantinib treatment and the dose modified according to the severity of 
the thrombocytopenia. 
Dose modification did allow most patients to continue treatment; 21% discontinued due to an AE 
(excluding disease progression) compared with 4.2% in the placebo arm. The AEs generally 
responsible for treatment discontinuation were PPES (2.4%), fatigue (1.5%), decreased appetite, 
diarrhoea and nausea (1.1% each). 
Therefore, the starting dose of 60mg, although it appears excessive from a safety viewpoint, does 
provide flexibility in terms of individual patient dosing.  
Adverse Events  
The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 20% incidence) were consistent with the known safety profile of 
cabozantinib and included diarrhoea, decreased appetite, PPES, fatigue, nausea, hypertension, 
vomiting, increased AST and asthenia. The most frequent AEs (≥ 20% incidence) in the placebo arm 
were fatigue and abdominal pain. 
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 25% of patients) in the 
HCC population included diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, fatigue, decreased 
appetite hypertension and nausea (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Similarly, the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 AEs were consistent with the known cabozantinib 
safety profile i.e. PPES, hypertension, increased AST, fatigue, diarrhoea, asthenia and decreased 
appetite. Of these Grade 3/4 events, PPES, AST increased, and decreased appetite occurred at a 
higher frequency in the HCC trial compared to the RCC trials XL184-308 and A031203, and more 
frequently in the cabozantinib arm compared to the placebo arm. 
In line with the patient population, there was a high overall incidence of SAEs; 50% in the cabozantinib 
arm and 37% in the placebo arm. The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the HCC 
 
population (≥1% incidence) are hepatic encephalopathy, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome, asthenia and diarrhea (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). For comparison, the most common 
serious adverse drug reactions in the RCC population (≥1% incidence) are diarrhoea, hypertension, 
dehydration, hyponatraemia, nausea, decreased appetite, embolism, fatigue, hypomagnesaemia, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES). 
Consistent with advanced HCC and underlying liver disease, Grade 3/4 liver – related AEs were 
reported frequently for both treatment arms; Grade 3/4 AEs in the primary SOC of hepatobiliary 
disorders were reported for 6.2% of cabozantinib and 8.4% of placebo subjects. The incidence of 
Grade 3/4 AEs of ascites (3.9% vs. 4.6%) and increased blood bilirubin (3.0% vs 1.7%) were 
generally similar for cabozantinib and placebo-treated subjects as were Grade ≥ 3 oesophageal varices 
haemorrhage (1.1% cabozantinib, 2.1% placebo). Grade 3/4 hepatic failure was reported with a higher 
incidence in the placebo arm (cabozantinib 0.4% vs placebo 2.5%). 
In the CELESTIAL study, hepatic encephalopathy was reported more frequently in the cabozantinib 
than the placebo arm. Cabozantinib has been associated directly or indirectly with diarrhoea, vomiting, 
decreased appetite and electrolyte abnormalities. In HCC patients with compromised livers, these non-
hepatic effects may be precipitating factors for the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC). A higher relative proportion of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) 
developed hepatic encephalopathy with cabozantinib treatment. 
The incidence of GI toxicity with cabozantinib was very high in comparison to placebo. Diarrhoea, 
nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most commonly 
reported GI adverse reactions. Prompt medical management, including supportive care with 
antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent dehydration, electrolyte 
imbalances and weight loss. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of 
cabozantinib should be considered in case of persistent or recurrent significant GI adverse reactions 
(see sections, 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
In addition, diarrhoea was a major cause of dose interruption (15%) and dose reduction (10%), 
second only to PPES. It also caused treatment discontinuations (1.1%), suggesting that diarrhoea was 
difficult to manage adequately with supportive care alone. It is noted that the risk of diarrhoea and 
PPES was concentration-dependent in the exposure-response analysis. 
Deaths and Events to monitor 
There was a high proportion of deaths up to the 01 June 2017 data cut-off: 314 (67%) in the 
cabozantinib arm and 167 (70%) in the placebo arm. Most deaths occurred more than 30 days after 
last dose of study (257 [55%] of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 139 [59%] in the placebo arm); 
these deaths were primarily attributed to PD (228 [49%] cabozantinib, 119 [50%] placebo).  
Deaths up to 30 days after the last dose occurred at a similar frequency in both arms; 57 (12%) 
subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 28 (12%) in the placebo arm. Over half of the deaths were 
attributed to PD, more in the placebo arm (cabozantinib 30 [6.4%] and placebo 21 [8.9%]); the most 
frequent Grade 5 AE was HCC (cabozantinib 5.1%, placebo 7.6%). More subjects died of other causes 
in the cabozantinib than the placebo arm (5.8 % vs 3.0%). 
A large proportion of the other Grade 5 events were hepatobiliary. In the cabozantinib arm, 11 
subjects (2.4%) experienced Grade 5 hepatobiliary events: hepatic failure (6 subjects), portal vein 
thrombosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis, ischemic hepatitis and liver disorder (1 subject 
each). In the placebo arm, 4 subjects (1.7%) experienced Grade 5 hepatobiliary events: hepatic failure 
(2 subjects), hepatorenal syndrome, and chronic hepatic failure (1 subject each). Six Grade 5 AEs up 
to 30 days after last dose were assessed as treatment-related in the cabozantinib arm (PTs of hepatic 
failure, hepatorenal syndrome, oesophagobronchial fistula, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, and upper GI haemorrhage), and one was assessed as treatment-related in the placebo arm 
(PT of hepatic failure). 
Events to monitor (ETMs) that are known to be associated with TKIs or VEGF pathway inhibition and 
have potentially serious consequences were defined.  These comprised GI perforation, fistula, abscess 
[all, intra-abdominal and pelvic], ≥  Grade 3 haemorrhage, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), 
arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), wound complications, hypertension, osteonecrosis, PPES, 
proteinuria, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), diarrhoea and QT 
prolongation.  
Diarrhoea was experienced by 54% of cabozantinib-treated subjects with 9.9% of patients having G3-
4 events. Most patients (82%) experienced 1 to 3 episodes of diarrhoea. Dose modification was 
required in 47/ 251 (18.7%) subjects with diarrhoea and dose interruption in 69/251 (27.4%). The 
toxicity grade post dose modification generally reflected the initial grade, although with no Grade 4 
events.  
PPES was experienced by 46% of cabozantinib-treated subjects with 17% of patients having G3 
events. Most patients (85%) experienced 1 to 4 episodes of PPES. Dose modification was required in 
119/ 217 (54.8%) subjects with PPES and dose interruption in 54.8%. The toxicity grade post dose 
modification generally reflected the initial grade. 
Over half of subjects were receiving 20mg cabozantinib daily prior to treatment discontinuation.  
Diarrhoea and PPES were generally manageable with dose adjustments. 
The incidence of Grade 3/4 fistula ETMs was similar between treatment arms. The single Grade 5 
oesophagobronchial fistula was reported for a cabozantinib-treated subject who had radiation induced 
esophagitis following recent prior radiotherapy to mediastinum and lung. 
In the CELESTIAL study, fatal haemorrhagic events were reported at a higher incidence with 
cabozantinib than placebo. Predisposing risk factors for severe haemorrhage in the advanced HCC 
population may include tumour invasion of major blood vessels and the presence of underlying liver 
cirrhosis resulting in oesophageal varices, portal hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. The CELESTIAL 
study excluded patients with concomitant anticoagulation treatment or antiplatelet agents. Subjects 
with untreated, or incompletely treated, varices with bleeding or high risk for bleeding were also 
excluded from this study (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC).  
The most frequently reported VTEs in the cabozantinib arm were pulmonary embolism and portal vein 
thrombosis; only portal vein thrombosis was reported in higher incidence in the cabozantinib compared 
with the placebo arm (1.3% vs 0), including one fatal event. Patients with a history of portal vein 
invasion appeared to be at higher risk of developing portal vein thrombosis.  Cabozantinib should be 
discontinued in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant 
thromboembolic complication (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Most patients (~80%) will have underlying cirrhosis. Cirrhosis increases the baseline risk for a patient 
entering the study, and there is potential for overlap between the cirrhosis-related risks and the 
toxicities of the agent under study. This is highlighted by the high level of SAEs (36%) in the placebo 
arm. Particularly, there is an increased risk of bleeding in this patient population, due to portal 
hypertension, varices and thrombocytopenia. The AEs were as seen with cabozantinib in other 
indications, exacerbated by the patient population, namely Grade 5 haemorrhage and episodes of 
portal vein (PV) thrombosis, including fatal events, particularly in patients with PV invasion at baseline. 
All fatal haemorrhagic (n=5) and thromboembolic events (n=2) occurred in the cabozantinib arm. The 
increased incidence of encephalopathy with cabozantinib, attributable to GI toxicity has been detailed 
in the SmPC. 
 Laboratory abnormalities 
There was higher post-baseline incidence of increased ALT (73% vs 37%) and AST (73% vs. 46%) in 
the cabozantinib arm relative to placebo; however, there was a similar incidence of increased bilirubin 
(38% vs 34%) and increased ALP (43% vs 38%) and a lower incidence of increased GGT (28% vs 
40%). Cases meeting Hy’s Law screening criteria were examined, and none were clearly indicative of 
DILI. 
It is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of 
cabozantinib treatment and to monitor closely during treatment. For patients with worsening of liver 
function tests considered related to cabozantinib treatment (i.e. where no alternative cause is evident), 
dose modification advices should be followed (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Cabozantinib has been associated with an increased incidence of electrolyte abnormalities (including 
hypo- and hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatremia). It is recommended to 
monitor biochemical parameters during cabozantinib treatment and to institute appropriate 
replacement therapy according to standard clinical practice if required. Cases of hepatic 
encephalopathy in HCC patients can be attributed to the development of electrolyte disturbances. Dose 
interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of cabozantinib should be considered in case of 
persistent or recurrent significant abnormalities (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC).   
There was a similar incidence of all-grade creatinine elevations in both arms (8.6% vs 7.2%). There 
was a higher incidence of all-grade haematology abnormalities, specifically decreased platelets, WBCs 
and ANCs with cabozantinib. Still, the incidence of the corresponding Grade 3-4 laboratory 
abnormalities was low; decreased platelets (cabozantinib 10%, placebo 1.3%), WBCs (4.9%, 0.8%) 
and ANCs (6.9%, 1.3%).  
Marked weight loss of ≥  10% from baseline at any post-baseline visit was recorded for 28% of 
subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with 4.6% in the placebo arm. The incidence of the 
corresponding AE of decreased weight was 17% vs 5.9% (Grade 3/4: 1.1% vs 0%). Weight loss could 
be attributed to gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity of cabozantinib. GI AEs were frequent with cabozantinib 
(≥ 20% incidence), particularly diarrhoea, but also decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting. 
Hypokalaemia and hypomagnesemia in the cabozantinib arm may be associated with the frequent 
occurrence of diarrhoea. GI toxicity and its effects have been included in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
Subgroups, post-marketing and pooled analysis 
Analyses of AEs and ETMs did not show a notable difference in safety between subgroups for intrinsic 
factors (sex, age group, race, weight group, ECOG PS, aetiology, extrahepatic spread and/or 
macrovascular invasion) or extrinsic factors (number of prior systemic anticancer therapy agents, 
region). 
There were no additional safety signals identified in the HCC cohort of Study XL184-203 RDT. Safety 
observations in the post-marketing setting through 28 November 2017 were also consistent with the 
known profile of cabozantinib. 
The safety profile of cabozantinib in HCC Study XL184-309 was generally in line with the pooled 
analysis of safety data incorporating XL184-309 and previously submitted RCC Studies XL184-308 and 
A031203 (AE data only); except certain events associated with HCC in the context of underlying liver 
disease originated only from study XL184-309. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of cabozantinib in advanced HCC reflects the known safety profile, however new ADRs have 
been identified such as hepatic encephalopathy. Grade 3/4 AEs associated with HCC occurred more 
frequently with cabozantinib, such as hepatic encephalopathy, increased liver enzymes and 
thrombocytopenia. The MAH should thoroughly review the ADRs included in the SmPC in the context of 
the next PSUR. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The important identified and potential risk should focus on the safety concerns that could potentially 
impact the risk- benefit balance of the product and would usually warrant further evaluation as part of 
the pharmacovigilance plan or additional risk minimisation activities. The MAH is requested to consider 
this issue in future updates of the Cabometyx and Cometriq RMPs.

Risk minimisation measures 
Routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures 
Routine  risk  minimisation  measures  are  proposed  for  all  the  safety  concerns.  This  is  sufficient  to 
minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
In the current variation, for the addition of the proposed indication in HCC, the design, layout and 
format of the leaflet are not impacted. The modifications relate to slight changes in the safety profile to 
include the safety profile in HCC and the current writing style has been respected. In the context of 
user testing, the updates are considered non-significant and the evidence from user testing previously 
performed on the Cabometyx leaflet is considered relevant and applicable to this application. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cabometyx is proposed as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who 
have previously been treated with sorafenib. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Surgical resection, liver transplantation, or percutaneous ablation are potentially curative in patients 
with early stage disease. However, these are not appropriate for most patients because of tumour size 
or location. Palliative TACE is a widely-used option for patients with unresectable disease without 
extrahepatic involvement. However, patients who present with advanced disease or those with 
recurrence after locoregional therapy have a very poor prognosis without further treatment: the 
expected median survival time is 6 months for patients with cancer-related symptoms, macrovascular 
invasion or extrahepatic spread. 
The standard treatment for patients with advanced HCC is sorafenib, a small molecule VEGF pathway 
inhibitor. Disease progression usually occurs due to acquired resistance to these therapies and more 
therapeutic options are needed in advanced HCC. 
Regorafenib received approval in the EU in 2017 for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been 
previously treated with sorafenib. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study was XL 184 309, a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of 
cabozantinib in previously treated subjects with advanced HCC who had received prior sorafenib and 
progressed on at least one prior systemic treatment for HCC.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Subjects in the cabozantinib 60mg qd arm had a statistically significant improvement in OS compared 
with placebo. There was a 2.2-month difference in the median OS, as estimated by KM analysis; 
median duration of OS were 10.2 vs 8.0 months in the cabozantinib and placebo arms respectively 
(stratified HR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.92; stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0049; critical p-value = 
0.021). The landmark estimate of the proportion of subjects that were event-free at 12 months was 
46% compared with 34%.  
The primary analysis of Investigator- determined PFS (PFS1) yielded a median duration of 5.2 months 
in the cabozantinib arm and 1.9 months in the placebo arm. The HR, adjusted for stratification factors 
(per IxRS), was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.52, stratified log-rank p-value < 0.0001). 
Results of additional sensitivity analyses of PFS (PFS2 and PFS3) were consistent with the primary 
PFS1 analysis. For PFS3 treatment discontinuation due to clinical deterioration was also an event. In 
addition, further systemic or local therapy or surgery were events for PFS2.  
PFS in the cabozantinib arm was similar in the full trial population and those who had received only 
prior sorafenib (5.2 vs. 5.5 months). 
Subgroup analyses of the primary OS showed consistent efficacy favouring cabozantinib across the 
majority of prespecified baseline and demographic subgroups, including subjects who had HBV 
aetiology and regardless of baseline AFP level (< or ≥  400ng/mL). In an ad hoc subgroup analysis, 
subjects whose only prior therapy for HCC was sorafenib also showed an OS benefit. For subjects who 
received 1 prior regimen the OS HR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.59, 0.92), whilst for subjects who received 2 
prior regimens the unstratified OS HR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.63, 1.29). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Recruited patients were a selected group with Child Pugh A and ECOG PS 0 or 1 so cabozantinib has 
not been investigated in patients with more advanced liver disease or poor performance status. This 
has been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 25% of patients) in the 
HCC population included diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, fatigue, decreased 
appetite hypertension and nausea. 
The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the HCC population (≥1% incidence) are hepatic 
encephalopathy, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, asthenia and diarrhoea. 
The incidence of SAEs was 50% in the cabozantinib arm and 37% in the placebo arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Due to the dose modifications for toxicity, the median daily dose in HCC patients was 36 mg 
cabozantinib, lower than in the pooled population (41mg) and notably lower than the starting dose of 
60mg.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Cabometyx has demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in overall survival compared to 
placebo in the proposed population of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have previously been 
treated with sorafenib. This is remarkable given the poor prognosis of these patients and the relatively 
few treatment options available. Secondary endpoints support the primary outcome. 
The safety profile appears similar to the known profile of cabozantinib except certain events associated 
with HCC in the context of underlying liver disease originated only from study XL184-309. These 
appear to be managed with appropriate monitoring and dose modifications. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance of cabozantinib as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma 
in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The prognosis of patients with advanced HCC is poor, as evidenced by the 8-month median OS in the 
placebo arm of the submitted Phase 3 study. There are relatively few treatment options for patients 
who progress on first line systemic therapy (currently sorafenib) – the median OS for regorafenib in 
this patient population post sorafenib in the RESORCE study was 10.6 months. 
The median improvement in OS with regorafenib compared to placebo (RESORCE study) was 2.8 
months. This was in a similarly restricted population (Child Pugh A 98%, ECOG PS 0 66% or 1 34%; 
BCLC stage B 13%, Stage C 87%). The additional 0.6 months with regorafenib over cabozantinib is 
likely not relevant in a cross-trial comparison.  Overall, the trial populations were similar. The main 
differences between the CELESTIAL and RESORCE studies concerned prior HCC therapy. In RESORCE 
patients had received only sorafenib as systemic therapy for advanced disease, whilst in CELESTIAL 
patients had received sorafenib but could also have received 1 other systemic therapy for advanced 
disease; 28% (n=130) patients in the cabozantinib arm had received 2 prior regimens, mainly 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (n=41), other TKIs (n=19) or antibodies (n=25), with the additional 
treatment in 45 patients not described.   
In RESORCE, patients had to have ‘tolerated’ sorafenib (at least 50% of the recommended daily dose 
for 20/28 days prior to discontinuation). There was no such stipulation for cabozantinib, but it is not 
known if patients intolerant of sorafenib were recruited; 69% patients (n=322) had progressed whilst 
receiving sorafenib as their most recent prior systemic agent and 96% (n=452) had progressed on 
sorafenib. Therefore, it seems unlikely that many sorafenib-intolerant patients were recruited. Median 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
duration of prior sorafenib treatment in RESORCE was 7.8 months and 5.3 months in the cabozantinib 
arm of CELESTIAL. 
Therefore, there are no important differences between the two trial populations that may have 
impacted efficacy or would allow a broader indication.  
However, most important in the benefit risk assessment will be the safety profile. Overall the safety 
profiles of regorafenib (from the EPAR) and cabozantinib were similar: including median duration of 
treatment, TEAEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, Grade 5 AEs and ETM/ AESI. There appeared to be marginally more 
SAEs (50 vs. 44.4%) and treatment related SAEs (18 vs 10.4%) with cabozantinib vs regorafenib. 
Most of the common AEs were reported at a similar frequency, although those with >10% difference 
were mainly GI and all occurred with cabozantinib (diarrhoea, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea and 
vomiting). Encephalopathy was more frequently reported with cabozantinib (5.6%) than regorafenib 
(1.9%) and at a higher incidence than placebo. LFT abnormalities (increased ALT/ AST) were similar 
for the 2 treatments.  
From the information available, cabozantinib appears to be more toxic than regorafenib.  
On the one-hand, cabozantinib efficacy may not vary according to the specific first line VEGF targeted 
therapy administered. However, the efficacy of cabozantinib after first-line treatment other than 
sorafenib cannot be extrapolated directly from that observed after sorafenib failure. This would require 
at least a further discussion on differences in targets and potencies and how these differences would 
contribute to anticancer activity in vivo in 2nd line treatment. It is questionable whether this can be 
based on in vitro data only. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cabometyx for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously 
been treated with sorafenib is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to add Cabometyx as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular 
carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated with safety and efficacy information. The package 
leaflet and the risk management plan (version 4.2) are updated accordingly.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication to add Cabometyx as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular 
carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated with safety and efficacy information. The package 
leaflet and the risk management plan (version 4.2) are updated accordingly.

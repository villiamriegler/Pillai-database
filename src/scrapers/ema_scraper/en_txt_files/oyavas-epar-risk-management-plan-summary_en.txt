Summary of risk management plan for Oyavas 
(bevacizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Oyavas. The RMP details important risks 
of  Oyavas,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Oyavas’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Oyavas’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Oyavas should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Oyavas should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Oyavas’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Oyavas  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer,  metastatic  breast  cancer, 
advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, advanced and/or metastatic renal cell 
cancer,  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  and  primary  peritoneal  cancer,  and  cervical  cancer  (see 
SmPC for the full indication). 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Oyavas’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Oyavas’s  EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/oyavas. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Oyavas, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Oyavas’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
−  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
− 
−  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
−  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Oyavas  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Oyavas. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term 
use of the medicine).

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
Since there are no safety concerns identified in summary of safety concerns, no summary of routine 
risk minimization measures is applicable.

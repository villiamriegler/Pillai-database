1.  Introduction 
On 26th October 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for larotrectinib (Vitrakvi), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
These data are also submitted as part of a post-authorisation measure. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the PIP02 report was prepared in accordance with the approved Pediatric 
Investigational Plan (EMEA-001971-PIP02-16-M04, decision date 03 DEC 2021).  
According to the MAH, this is the last report listed in the program (of PIP02). A line listing of all the 
concerned studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Larotrectinib was administrated as capsules or oral solution. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The PIP02 report evaluated treatment of pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with 
advanced solid tumors harboring an NTRK fusion, of all conditions included in the category of 
malignant neoplasms (except CNS tumors, hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms). 
The main components of the PIP02 report were the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and  
biomarker results in the PIP02 population based on Study 20290 (SCOUT) (N=105). Additional efficacy 
and safety results for a subset of patients who received the new age-appropriate oral solution (N=14) 
in Study 20290 (SCOUT), and palatability of the new age-appropriate oral solution were also described. 
Information on the new age-appropriate oral solution and an assessment of administration of this age-
appropriate oral solution via nasogastric tube were also provided.  
Sensitivity analyses for efficacy were presented for the pooled group of pediatric and adult patients 
across Studies 20288, 20289, and 20290 (N=244).  
The individual studies included in the PIP02 report: 
• Development of larotrectinib solution 2% 50 mL for oral use: The development of the new age-
appropriate larotrectinib solution 2 % 50 mL for oral use  
• NGT Study S21001492: Extractables study for nasogastric tubes  
• Study 20290 (SCOUT): The main analysis of efficacy, safety, PK and biomarkers in the PIP02 report 
is based on data from a subset of patients in Study 20290. 
• Study 20288, Study 20289, and Study 20290 data: A sensitivity analysis of efficacy of pediatric and 
adult patients is based on pooled data from these 3 studies. 
• Study 21767: A historical analysis evaluating results from Study 20290 and data from Institute Curie 
and CWS registries.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
20290, SCOUT 
Hereafter referred to as Study 20290. 
Description 
Study 20290 is an ongoing multicenter open-label Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients aged from birth 
to 21 years with advanced solid or primary CNS tumors. The study is divided into a Phase 1 dose 
escalation portion, a Phase 1 dose expansion portion, and a Phase 2 portion.  
Methods 
The primary study objectives of the Phase 1 portion (dose escalation and dose expansion) include the 
characterization of safety and DLT, PK, identification of the MTD or appropriate dose of larotrectinib for 
further study, description of antitumor activity (ORR and other efficacy parameters), and pain and 
health-related QoL.  
In the Phase 2 portion, enrollment is restricted to patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) 
fusion cancer with measurable disease.  
The primary study objective of the Phase 2 portion is to determine the ORR as determined by an 
independent radiology review committee following treatment with larotrectinib in pediatric patients 
with an advanced cancer harboring a gene fusion involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (collectively 
referred to as NTRK gene fusions) fusions. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) oversaw the safety 
aspects of the study and rendered dose escalation decisions in the Phase 1 portion of the study 
through ongoing review of serious AEs and other safety trends throughout the conduct of the study. 
The membership of the SRC consisted of the Sponsor’s representatives and clinically qualified 
individuals from each active clinical site. 
The study is ongoing and will continue beyond the above specified dataset for PIP02; the MAH states 
that such continuation is not considered to be part of the PIP02. 
Sample size 
N/A 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The study was not randomized nor blinded.  
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy results are based on independent review committee (IRC) assessments. The performed 
evaluations were exploratory. 
Results 
The latest results of the study as of the data cut-off date of 20 JUL 2021 are presented in detail  
in the fourth interim analysis in Report PH-42037, dated 21 JAN 2022. 
Study 20290 was conducted worldwide in a predominantly NTRK positive population, without ethnic 
6 
 
 
specifications. As of 20 JUL 2021, 135 patients in total had been treated in the study. Enrollment in the 
Phase 1 dose escalation (N=24) and the Phase 1 expansion (N=16) was completed, and enrollment for 
the Phase 2 portion was still ongoing (N=95).  
•  A total of 126 patients (93%) had an NTRK gene fusion. The median age across all dose groups 
was 4.9 years (range <1 month to 20.5 years). Overall enrollment was balanced by gender, 
and the most commonly represented race was white, followed by Asian. 
•  A confirmed ORR of 71% (95% CI: [62, 79]) and clinical benefit rate of 93% (95% CI: [87, 
97]) was obtained in the 115 evaluable NTRK gene fusion patients, based on investigator 
assessments. Patients with TRK fusion cancers treated with larotrectinib exhibited responses 
across NTRK isoforms, tumor types and patient ages.  
•  At a median follow-up time of 25.8 months, 26 of the responding patients had progressed. The 
median DOR had not been reached. The DOR was >6 months for 75% and was >12 months for 
63% of responder patients with TRK fusion cancer. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The median time to response of confirmed CR or PR was 57 days (range: 27, 276).  
The safety profile of larotrectinib was based on 135 dosed patients (126 patients with NTRK 
gene fusions). The patients were between less than 1 month and 20.5 years of age and had 
received study treatment for up to 63.5 months, at starting doses ranging from 17.5 to 120.1 
mg/m2 BID. An MTD was not reached.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) commonly consisted of gastrointestinal 
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation), pyrexia, upper respiratory tract 
infection, cough, headache, and nasopharyngitis, or related to investigations, i.e., ALT and AST 
increases, anemia, and neutrophil count decreased. In general, these TEAEs did not interfere 
with the successful delivery of larotrectinib at the intended dose and schedule.  
Three patients died on study due to an AE unrelated to study treatment, or disease  
progression and its complications. 
•  Selected TEAEs of special interest included AST/ALT increases, neurologic events, and 
neutropenia: 
o  Thirty-one patients experienced Grade 2 and/or Grade 3 ALT/AST increase in 
laboratory values. For 6 patients, dose modification was required; one of these patients 
had an AE of Grade 3 ALT elevation (DLT) that contributed to study drug 
discontinuation.  
o 
In the MAHs evaluation, clinical data indicated an overall mild effect of larotrectinib on 
CNS, resulting in neurologic events, and most reactions resolved under continued 
larotrectinib treatment, in the vast majority without any dose reduction. There was one 
Grade 5 neurologic event of cerebellar hemorrhage that was considered not related to 
treatment with larotrectinib. One Grade 3 neurologic event (preferred term: irritability) 
was considered related to larotrectinib.  
o  TEAEs due to neutrophil count decreased were noted in 39 (29%) patients across dose 
cohorts. Of these, Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 22 patients and Grade 4 TEAEs in 4 
patients. Of the 26 patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 17 patients had a dose 
interruption and dose reduction, 3 patients discontinued study drug, and for 6 patients 
the TEAE resolved without dose modification. Most patients with neutrophil count 
decreases had returned to their baseline grade or better by the time of the last post-
7 
 
baseline measurement. It is possible that this was associated with viral infections and 
the pre-study treatment regimens that are more common in pediatric populations. 
In summary, the interim results showed that larotrectinib demonstrated antitumor activity in pediatric 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK gene fusions that had little or no 
effective treatment alternatives. Larotrectinib had a safety profile characterized by recognizable 
toxicities which were mostly Grade 1 and 2 and were reversible, predictable, manageable, and could be 
monitored. 
2.3.3.  PIP02 Study  
Description 
To meet the reporting requirements of EMEA-001971-PIP02-16-M04, the patients presented in the 
main analyses in the PIP02 report are a subset of the patients presented in the Clinical Study Report 
for Study 20290. This subset of patients is referred to throughout the document as the “PIP02 
population” and is described below.  
Methods 
PIP02 population characteristics 
A total of 105 patients from Study 20290 were included in the analyses presented in the PIP02 report 
(i.e., PIP02 population). Patients included were from the Phase 1 part of the study who had received 1 
or more doses of larotrectinib, had documented NTRK gene fusion, and were <18 years of age. 
Patients who enrolled into the Phase 2 part were included if additionally they had a non-primary CNS 
solid tumor, were treated at a larotrectinib dose of 100 mg/m2 twice daily (BID), and had measurable 
disease at baseline. (Note: patients with primary CNS tumors from the Phase 1 dose expansion were 
included in the analysis to fulfil requirements related to sample size.) 
The study is ongoing and will continue beyond the above specified dataset for PIP02; the MAH states 
that such continuation is not considered to be part of the PIP02. 
Patients in Study 20290 receiving the new age-appropriate oral solution 
The subset of patients from Study 20290 presented in this PIP02 report who received the new oral 
solution were enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study and were in Cohort 3 (larotrectinib dose of 100 
mg/m2 BID). These patients started their first treatment and continued on treatment using the new 
oral solution. 
The Palatability analysis set is used for the assessment safety and efficacy of the new oral solution in 
the PIP02 report. Patients who met the following criteria were included: 
• 
Enrolled into phase 2 of Study 20290 
•  Started first treatment on the new oral solution and used it continually 
•  Were recruited up to 12 months before the data cut-off 08 APR 2022 (i.e., all patients should 
have had 12 or even more months of follow-up) 
• 
Therefore, patients with primary CNS cancer and/or no measurable disease at baseline were 
also eligible to be included in this analysis set. 
8 
 
 
Treatments 
Patients in the Phase 1 dose expansion and all patients in the Phase 2 part received the recommended 
dose for pediatric patients, i.e., 100 mg/m2 BID (with a maximum of 100 mg BID). 
The larotrectinib doses administered were grouped in dose cohorts for Study 20290:  
• Dose level 1 (Cohort 1) refers to the 9.6-55 mg/m2 BID cohort 
• Dose level 2 (Cohort 2) refers to the 17.3-120 mg/m2 BID cohort  
• Dose level 3 (Cohort 3) refers to the 100 mg/m2 BID cohort  
Patients in Study 20290 receiving the new age-appropriate oral solution 
Oral dosing was based on adult equivalent of 100 or 150 mg BID, then 100 mg/m2 BID (with a 
maximum of 100 mg BID). Actual doses administered ranged from 17.5 to 120.1 mg/m2 BID Capsules 
(25 mg and 100 mg) or oral solution (20 mg/mL) New oral solution: 20 mg/mL oral solution; 100 
mg/m2 BID.

2.3.4.  Efficacy results, PIP02 population 
Baseline data  
A total of 105 patients from Study 20290 were included in the analyses presented in the PIP02 report 
(i.e., PIP02 population). 
The median age of the 105 treated patients across all dose groups in the PIP02 population was 
3.33 years, ranging from less than 1 month to 17.8 years. The patient population was generally 
balanced by gender. Study 20290 is being conducted worldwide in North America, Europe and Asia 
Pacific. The most commonly represented race was white (61.9%), followed by Asian (17.1%). As the 
population of patients with an NTRK gene fusion is rare, the ratio between patients of certain ethnicity 
and/or race could not be influenced. 
Among patients receiving the new oral solution, the median age was 2.04 years (range 0.1 to 15.8 
years), and the group was also balanced by gender. Patients were predominantly Asian (57.1% of 
patients), followed by white (35.7%).  
Patients in the PIP02 population had locally advanced (59.0%) or metastatic disease (30.5%) or were 
primary CNS patients (10.5%) at the time of enrollment. The most common malignancies were IFS 
(46.7%), STS (35.2%), and primary CNS tumors (10.5%). Performance status (Karnofsky or Lansky 
depending upon age) was high, with a median across all patients of 100.00 (range: 50.00 to 100.00). 
Overall, 69.5% of the patients had received previous systemic anti-cancer therapy. 
Similarly, most patients receiving the new oral solution had locally advanced (64.3%) disease at the 
time of enrollment The most common malignancies were IFS (50.0% of patients), primary CNS tumors 
(28.6%), and STS (21.4%). Performance status (based on Lansky or Karnofsky performance status 
10 
 
 
scales) was also high, with a median of 90.00 (range: 50.0 to 100.0). Overall, 57.1% of the patients 
receiving the new oral solution had received previous systemic anti-cancer therapy. 
Of the 105 patients in the PIP02 safety analysis set (SAF), 98 patients were included in the efficacy 
evaluation i.e., in the PIP02 EAS. Primary diagnosis was IFS for 47 patients, STS for 34 patients, 
primary CNS for 11 patients, thyroid cancer for 3 patients, congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN) for 
2 patients, and melanoma for 1 patient. 
Of the 14 patients receiving the new oral solution, 12 were evaluated for efficacy of the new oral 
solution and were included in the palatability analysis set. Of note, the new oral solution was first 
administered in FEB 2020 in Study 20290, resulting in relatively short follow-up times for these 
patients compared with the PIP02 EAS population. 
Patients who completed a palatability questionnaire on C1D1 and C1D8 did not need to have a follow-
up time of at least 12 months to be included in the analysis of palatability of the new oral solution. 
Efficacy Results  
Overall response rate 
Tumor response was evaluated using RECIST 1.1 for solid tumors (excluding primary CNS tumors) and 
RANO for primary CNS cancers. 
The ORR based on 89 evaluable patients was 84.3% (95% CI: [75.0, 91.1]) in the PIP02 EAS.  
For the 12 efficacy evaluable patients in the palatability analysis set, the confirmed ORR was 66.7% 
(95% CI: [34.9, 90.1]).  
ORR by primary diagnosis or by NTRK gene fusion isoform for the PIP02 EAS is presented in table 3. As 
reflected in the ORR, responses were high in patients with IFS (95.5%, 95% CI: [84.5, 99.4]) and STS 
(82.4%, 95% CI: [65.5, 93.2]), the most common tumors in the PIP02 EAS population. The sample 
sizes of the other tumors were insufficient for any generalizations to be made.  
Patients with TRK fusion cancers treated with larotrectinib exhibited responses across NTRK isoforms.

Figure 2. Swimmer plot of time to response and overall treatment duration of patients receiving the 
new oral solution (IRC) (palatability analysis set)  
Duration of response 
There were 75 responding patients in the PIP02 EAS and 8 responding patients who received the new 
oral solution. Most responses were continuing at the time of the data cut-off. 
13 
 
 
 
For the PIP02 EAS, at the time of the data cut-off, and with a median duration of follow-up of 
19.1 months, the median duration of response was 31.4 months (range of 0.0 to 53.0 months). The 
corresponding Kaplan-Meier curve is presented in Figure 3.  
With a median duration of follow-up of 12.0 months, the median DOR was not estimable for patients in 
the palatability analysis set (range 3.0 to 21.1 months). 
Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier plot of duration of response (IRC) (PIP EAS)  
Progression-free survival 
In the PIP02 EAS, 94 patients (95.9%) were evaluated for progression by IRC. There were 34 patients 
(34.7%) with documented disease progression. At the time of the interim data cut-off, the median 
duration of follow-up for PFS was 20.7 months. The median PFS was 33.3 months, with minimum and 
maximum PFS ranging from 0.0 to 56.9 months. Based on the Kaplan-Meier method, the rate of PFS 
for at least 6 months of treatment was 91% (95% CI: [85, 97]), for at least 12 months was 80% 
(95% CI: [71, 89]), and for at least 48 months was 35% (95% CI: [19, 52]). The corresponding 
Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is presented in Figure 4.  
For the patients in the palatability analysis set, the median duration of follow-up was 13.8 months. As 
the new oral solution was introduced in 2020, the median duration of follow-up was shorter than in the 
PIP02 EAS. There were 4 patients (33.3%) with a PFS event, and the median PFS was not evaluable 
(range from 2.1 to 23.3 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimated rate of PFS for at least 6 months of 
treatment was 81% (95% CI: [57, 100]).

Overall survival 
In the PIP02 EAS, 6 of the 98 patients (6.1%) died on or before the cut-off date and the median OS 
was not reached. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS of at least 12 months was 97% (95% CI: [93, 
100]). The corresponding Kaplan-Meier curve is presented in Figure 5. 
One of the 12 patients (8.3%) in the palatability analysis set died on or before the cut-off date and the 
median OS was not reached.

Palatability of the new oral solution 
In Study 20290, 7 patients who were treated with the new oral solution completed the palatability 
questionnaire during Cycle 1, on Day 1 and Day 8 of treatment. The questionnaire was used for 
evaluation of the appearance, smell, taste, feeling in mouth/texture, and after taste of the new oral 
solution (possible ratings: very bad, bad, neutral, good, very good, not assessable) and whether it was 
difficult to swallow. 
The overall assessment at both time points (Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 8) varied among patients, with 
neutral reported in 3 patients (42.9%), and very good, good, and very bad reported in 2 patients 
(28.6%) each. The overall assessment was not assessable for 1 patient at Cycle 1 Day 1. Ratings of 
appearance, smell, taste, feeling in mouth/texture, and after taste also varied among patients. For 
nearly all patients (6 patients, 85.7%), the new oral solution was not difficult to swallow. 
2.3.5.  Pooled analysis in pediatric and adult patients: Efficacy results from 
patients in Studies 20290, 20289, and 20288 
For the sensitivity analysis of efficacy (by IRC), a total of 244 adult and pediatric patients were pooled 
from Studies 20290, 20289, and 20288 and included those who had received 1 or more doses of 
larotrectinib, had documented NTRK gene fusion, had a non-primary CNS solid tumor with 1 or more 
measurable lesions at baseline and had begun treatment up to 6 months before the data cut-off 20 JUL 
2021 (all patients had at least 5 months of follow-up).  
These 244 patients constituted the extended primary analysis set 6 (ePAS6).  
•  As of 20 JUL 2021, the ORR as assessed by IRC was 69% with an estimated median duration 
of response of 38.44 months. The response rate observed across patients with different tumor 
16 
 
 
types supports the use of larotrectinib in a histology-independent (i.e., tumor agnostic) 
population. 
•  Adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion cancers treated with larotrectinib exhibited 
responses across NTRK isoforms, tumor types and patient ages Overall, there were no major 
differences between the efficacy results of the pediatric patients  
from Study 20290 and the pooled adult and pediatric populations of Studies 20290, 20289, 
and 20288 of the ePAS6. The MAH also found the safety profile of larotrectinib comparable 
between the two analysis populations. 
Additionally, the results from the PIP02 efficacy population (patients <18 years of age,  
predominantly with IFS or STS) and the adult subgroup of patients in the ePAS6 (≥18 years of age) 
showed high overall response rates in both groups (84.3% for pediatric patients, 60% for adult 
patients). 
2.3.6.  Safety results, PIP02 population 
Analysis sets for safety evaluation 
The Safety analysis set (SAF) is the main analysis set used for the safety evaluation in the PIP02 
report. It includes patients from Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts of Study 20290. Patients who enrolled into 
the Phase 1 dose escalation or extension cohort of Study 20290 were included in the PIP02 SAF if they 
fulfilled the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
Received 1 or more doses of larotrectinib 
Had documented NTRK gene fusion as determined by local testing 
<18 years of age 
Patients who enrolled into Phase 2 of Study 20290 were included in the PIP02 SAF if they fulfilled the 
following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Received 1 or more doses of larotrectinib 
Had documented NTRK gene fusion as determined by local testing 
<18 years of age 
Had a non-primary CNS solid tumor 
Were treated with larotrectinib at dose level 3 (100 mg/m2 BID) 
Had measurable disease at baseline as assessed by the investigator and RECIST 1.1 
The Palatability analysis set is used for the assessment safety of the new oral solution in the PIP02 
report. 
Extent of exposure  
In the PIP02 SAF, a median of 16.0 cycles (of 28 days) of treatment had been initiated, with a median 
study treatment duration of 14.80 months (range: 1.0, 63.5). Median durations were longer in the 
earlier cohorts, reflecting the earlier initiation of these cohorts and the interim nature of the analysis. 
For patients receiving the new oral solution (palatability analysis set), a median of 13.5 cycles had 
been initiated, with a median study treatment duration of 13.35 months (range: 3.6, 27.0). The 
17 
 
 
relatively short duration of treatment is largely due to the late initiation of the new oral solution (first 
patients treated with the new oral solution in FEB 2020). 
Summary of adverse events 
In the PIP02 SAF, TEAEs were most commonly seen (i.e., in >50% of patients overall) in the 
Gastrointestinal disorders (81.9%), Infections and infestations (81.0%), General disorders and 
administration site conditions (68.6%), Investigations (67.6%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (58.1%), Blood and lymphatic system disorders (58.1%), and Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (54.3%).  
The most commonly reported TEAEs (occurring in >20% of patients) were vomiting, pyrexia, AST 
increased, cough, ALT increased, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, neutrophil count 
decreased, anemia, constipation, nasopharyngitis, headache, and nausea (Table 4). TEAEs that were 
considered related to larotrectinib occurring in >15% of patients were AST increased, ALT increased, 
neutrophil count decreased, and anemia. 
Table 4. Treatment-emergent adverse events (with overall incidence of more than 20% of patients in 
either analysis set) (PIP02 SAF and palatability analysis set)  
For most patients, the maximum severity of TEAEs were Grade 2 (30.5%) and Grade 3 (49.5%). There 
were 65 patients (61.9%) who experienced a TEAE of worst Grade 3 or 4, and these were considered 
related to larotrectinib in 30 patients (28.6%). Neutrophil count decreased was the only larotrectinib-
related Grade 3 or 4 TEAE occurring in more than one patient (16 patients, 15.2%). There were no 
patients in the PIP02 SAF with a Grade 5 TEAE. 
18 
 
 
Forty-six patients (43.8%) experienced at least 1 SAE; those events occurring in 2 or more patients 
each were pyrexia, pneumonia, influenza, seizure, viral infection, vomiting, device related infection, 
diarrhea, gastroenteritis viral, headache, hydrocephalus, malaise, urticaria, vascular device infection, 
and wound infection. 
Nine patients had 14 SAEs considered related to larotrectinib, including ejection fraction decreased and 
cardiac disorder (both events in 1 patient), abdominal pain, hematuria, hyponatremia, hypoventilation, 
malaise, pneumonia (in 1 patient each), hypernatremia (3 events in 1 patient), and vomiting (2 
events) and irritability (both in 1 patient). 
Six patients (5.7%) discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs; in two patients neutrophil count 
decreased led to discontinuation. Six patients died, all due to disease progression and none within 28 
days after the last dose of larotrectinib, and for 5 of the patients the deaths were not during treatment 
or within 28 days after the last dose of larotrectinib. The date of death of 1 patient is unknown; 
however, the death occurred after disease progression and treatment discontinuation. 
TEAEs are summarized by age group in Table 5. AE incidences were generally similar across the age 
groups. 
TEAEs occurring in ≥20% of patients in any age subgroup and their relationship to larotrectinib are 
summarized in Module 5.3.5.3, PIP02 Report, Table 9–10. Several of the most commonly occurring 
TEAEs regardless of causality were reported with a higher incidence in infants and toddlers (birth to < 
24 months age group) compared with patients in both of the other age groups (children 2 to <12 years 
and adolescents 12 to <18 years): pyrexia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, neutrophil count 
decreased, and constipation.

Adverse events of special interest 
ALT and AST elevation 
A total of 46 patients (44%) experienced treatment-emergent ALT/AST increase (based on PTs ALT 
increased, AST increased, and transaminases increased) of Grade 1 or higher. Grade ≥2 laboratory 
elevations were experienced by 11 patients; 1 patient had both Grade 2 and Grade 3 elevations, and 1 
patient had a Grade 3 elevation. 
For 5 patients, TEAEs of ALT increased and/or AST increased resulted in dose modifications (i.e., 
interruption or dose modification) in larotrectinib treatment. Most patients experiencing Grade 1 or 2 
AST and/or ALT elevations continued treatment with larotrectinib through this laboratory finding. 
Importantly, no patient met the Hy’s Law criteria for drug-induced liver injury. Fifteen patients 
displayed a 3-fold or greater elevation in ALT relative to the ULN and 16 patients had a 3-fold or 
greater elevation in AST relative to the ULN. However, none of these patients had an out-of-range total 
bilirubin value, required for Hy’s Law. 
Neutropenia 
The most commonly reported hematologic toxicity was neutrophil count decreased: shifts of 1, 2, 3 or 
4 grades were experienced by 26, 11, 21 and 5 patients, respectively. At the last post baseline 
measurement, values in most patients had returned to baseline.  
Neutropenia was reported as a TEAE in 35 patients (33.3%). The maximum severity was Grade 1 in 4 
patients (4%), Grade 2 in 6 patients (6%), Grade 3 in 21 patients (20%), and Grade 4 in 4 patients 
(4%). Neutropenia was considered related to larotrectinib by the investigator in 26 patients (24.8%), 
but none was judged serious. Febrile neutropenia was reported as a TEAE in 1 patient. Generally, the 
neutropenia events occurred in the first 6 months of study treatment (23 out of 35 patients, 65.7%). 
Of the 25 patients with treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 AEs of neutropenia, 19 patients had events 
that led to dose modification, including dose interrupted, modified, and discontinued. For the remaining 
6 patients, the neutropenia resolved without study drug modification. 
Neurologic events 
Neurologic symptoms are a possible on-target toxicity from TRK inhibition. Neurologic events occurring 
in more than 3 patients overall were headache (22 patients), insomnia (9 patients), agitation (8 
patients), dizziness (7 patients), irritability (6 patients), gait disturbance (5 patients), and presyncope, 
seizure, somnolence, anxiety, and restlessness (4 patients each). Assessment of these effects in 
children is complicated by its subjectivity and by difficulties with self-reporting. 
Overall, 36 patients (34.3%) had TEAEs in the SOC Nervous system disorders and 34 patients (32.4%) 
in the SOC Psychiatric disorders. The majority of neurologic events were Grade 1 or 2 and were 
considered not related to larotrectinib treatment by the investigator. 
A total of 10 (9.5%) patients had maximum Grade 3 or 4 neurologic events. Gait disturbance and 
headache were maximum Grade 3 in severity in 2 (2.1%) patients each. Other maximum Grade 3 
neurologic events included hydrocephalus, irritability, paresthesia, peripheral motor neuropathy and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy in 1 patient (1.1%) each. Maximum Grade 4 neurologic events were 
hydrocephalus and seizure in 1 patient (1.1%) each. 
The Grade 1 or 2 neurologic events that were considered related to larotrectinib included headache (5 
patients, 4.8%), dizziness, insomnia, and agitation (2 patients, 1.9% each), and paresthesia, 
irritability, anxiety, and restlessness (1 patient, 1.0% each). One Grade 3 event of irritability was 
considered related to larotrectinib treatment; this event led to study treatment interruption and was 
20 
 
resolved before the data cut-off date. None of the other Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were considered related to 
larotrectinib treatment.  
One Grade 2 TEAE of motor dysfunction (a patient with primary CNS cancer) led to discontinuation of 
larotrectinib. Most neurologic events resolved under continued larotrectinib treatment, in the vast 
majority of patients without any dose reduction. 
Palatability analysis set 
The most common TEAEs were AST increased, upper respiratory tract infection, ALT increased, 
neutrophil count decreased, pyrexia, diarrhea, and anemia. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic analysis was based on blood samples collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 4 Day 
1 at predose (only for Cycle 4 Day 1) and at 1 (±15 minutes) and 4 hours (±15 minutes) post-dose. 
Validated high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was used to 
quantify the plasma larotrectinib concentrations. 
A non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was used to analyse the PK data and included calculation of 
several pharmacokinetic parameters such as overall exposure (AUC0-4 and AUC0-12) and plasma 
larotrectinib peak exposure (Cmax). 
The PK analysis data set consisted of patients that received at least one dose of study drug and had 
sufficient plasma concentration data to assess at least one plasma PK parameter. The number of 
patients included in the PK analysis of Study 20290 in different age groups are shown in Table 6. The 
presented results are based on PK report BAYE-NCA-LARO-3697 dated 28 July 2022.

In summary,  
• Plasma larotrectinib overall exposure (AUC0-4 and AUC0-12) for the youngest pediatric age group of 
1 to 3 months was 4 to 6-fold higher in Cycle 1 Day 1 and 2- to 7-fold higher in Cycle 4 Day 1 
compared with other age groups, while the oldest age group of 12 to 18 years showed the lowest 
exposure for both visits. Dose normalized AUC parameters followed a similar trend. 
23 
 
 
 
• Plasma larotrectinib peak exposure (Cmax) for the youngest pediatric age group of 1 to 3 months 
was 2- to 4-fold higher in Cycle 1 Day 1 and 2- to 10-fold higher in Cycle 4 Day 1 compared with other 
age groups, while the oldest age group of 12 to 18 years showed the lowest peak of exposure in both 
visits. Dose normalized Cmax parameters followed a similar trend. 
• There was generally no plasma larotrectinib accumulation between Cycle 1 and Cycle 4, with the 
majority of pediatric age groups showing accumulation ratios for AUC0-4 (AR AUC0-4) between 0.68 
and 0.88, except for the 2 to 6 years age group with value AR AUC0-4 of 1.4. However, note that this 
age group has limited data availability (N=1); therefore this result should be interpreted with caution. 
• Geometric mean plasma larotrectinib CLss/F was the lowest for the youngest age group of 1 to 3 
months, while the oldest age group of 12 to 18 years showed the highest value. 
These data should be interpreted with caution, due to limited data availability per age group. The 
additional PK data was observed to be generally in the range observed for previous PK data in the 
respective age categories. 
2.3.7.  Extractables study for nasogastric tubes 
The submission of the extraction studies for nasogastric tubes (NGT Study S21001492) is 
acknowledged. The conclusion drawn that the three alternative nasogastric feeding tube types 
investigated (polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride and silicone) are safe for their intended use of 
administration is supported. 
2.3.8.  MAH Conclusion 
The results of the analyses of the patients evaluable for efficacy and safety in this PIP02 report were 
similar to the results of the full population in Study 20290. Larotrectinib demonstrated clinically 
meaningful antitumor activity in pediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors 
with NTRK gene fusions, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 84.3% and a median duration of 
response (DOR) of 31.4 months, as assessed by IRC. Larotrectinib demonstrated a favorable safety 
profile and was generally well tolerated. 
Fourteen patients, who received the new age-appropriate oral solution, were included in the analysis 
presented in this report, of whom 12 were evaluable for efficacy and safety. No notable differences in 
efficacy results for patients receiving the new oral solution compared with the PIP02 population were 
observed. No unexpected new adverse events were reported for patients receiving the new oral 
solution. 
With respect to PK, the youngest pediatric age group of 1 to 3 months had higher PK exposure 
compared with other age groups, while the oldest age group of 12 to 18 years showed the lowest PK 
exposure. 
2.3.9.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The PIP02 report evaluated treatment of pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with 
advanced solid tumors harboring an NTRK fusion, of all conditions included in the category of 
malignant neoplasms (except CNS tumors, hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms). 
The PIP02 was based on Study 20290 which is an ongoing multicenter open-label Phase 1/2 study in 
pediatric patients aged from birth to 21 years with advanced solid or primary CNS tumors. 
The main components of the PIP02 report were the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and  
biomarker results in the PIP02 population based on Study 20290 (SCOUT) (N=105). I addition, efficacy 
24 
 
and safety results for 14 patients who were treated with the new age-appropriate solution in Study 
20290 were described.  
The ORR based on 89 evaluable patients was 84.3% (95% CI: [75.0, 91.1]). For the 12 efficacy 
evaluable patients in the palatability analysis set, the confirmed ORR was 66.7% (95% CI: 
[34.9, 90.1]).  
The submitted efficacy, toxicity, tolerability and PK data is consistent with the known profile of Vitrakvi 
in paediatric patients. 
No changes to the SmPC are proposed based on results from the PIP02 report; this is accepted. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall, the data do not change the positive benefit-risk-assessment for the medicinal product. 
Currently, available information in the SmPC regarding pediatric patients remains unchanged.  
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
“Not fulfilled” refers to the PAM. The data submitted was not intended to fulfil a PAM.  
To get a compliance check of the PIP, the final data should be submitted to the PDCO in a compliance 
check procedure.    
In the current procedure, there is no request for supplementary information.

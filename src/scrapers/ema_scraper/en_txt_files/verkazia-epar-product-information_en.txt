CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indication 
Treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in children from 4 years of age and 
adolescents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Verkazia treatment should only be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional 
qualified in ophthalmology. 
Posology 
Children from 4 years of age and adolescents 
The recommended dose is one drop of Verkazia 4 times a day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening) 
to be applied to each affected eye during the VKC season. If signs and symptoms of VKC persist after 
the end of the season, the treatment can be maintained at the recommended dose or decreased to one 
drop twice daily once adequate control of signs and symptoms is achieved. Treatment should be 
discontinued after signs and symptoms are resolved, and reinitiated upon their recurrence. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, treatment should be continued on the next instillation as normal. Patients should be 
advised not to instill more than one drop for each instillation in the affected eye(s). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Verkazia in children below 4 years in the treatment of severe vernal 
keratoconjunctivitis.

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
The effect of Verkazia has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, no 
special dose adjustment is needed in these populations. 
Method of administration 
Ocular use 
Precautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product 
Patients should be instructed to first wash their hands. 
Prior to administration, the single-dose container should be gently shaken. 
For single use only. Each single-dose container is sufficient to treat both eyes. 
Patients should be instructed to use nasolacrimal occlusion and to close the eyelids for 2 minutes after 
instillation, to reduce the systemic absorption. This may result in a decrease in systemic undesirable 
effects and an increase in local activity (see section 4.4).  
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be 
administered at least 15 minutes apart. Verkazia should be administered last (see section 4.4). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Ocular or peri-ocular malignancies or premalignant conditions. 
Active or suspected ocular or peri-ocular infection. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Contact lenses 
Patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied. Therefore, the use of Verkazia with contact 
lenses is not recommended. 
Concomitant therapy 
Co-administration of Verkazia with eye drops containing corticosteroids may potentiate the effects of 
Verkazia on the immune system. However, in clinical studies, 18 patients received Verkazia (4 times 
daily) in co-administration with eye drops containing corticosteroids and no increase in the risk of 
adverse reactions related to the immune system was identified. Therefore, caution should be exercised 
when corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with Verkazia (see section 4.5). 
Effects on the immune system 
Ophthalmic medicinal products, which affect the immune system, including ciclosporin, may affect 
host defences against local infections and malignancies. Therefore, regular examination of the eye(s) is 
recommended, e.g. every 3 to 6 months, when Verkazia is used for more than 12 months. 
Verkazia has not been studied in patients with an active orofacial herpes simplex infection, a history of 
ocular herpes, varicella-zoster, or vaccinia virus infection and should therefore be used with caution in 
such patients. 
Excipient 
Verkazia contains cetalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with Verkazia. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females 
Verkazia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Verkazia in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration of ciclosporin 
at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little 
relevance to the clinical use of Verkazia. 
Verkazia is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
Following systemic absorption ciclosporin is excreted in breast milk. There is insufficient information 
on the effects of ciclosporin in newborns/infants. However, at therapeutic doses of ciclosporin in eye 
drops, it is unlikely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Verkazia therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of Verkazia on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Verkazia has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
This medicinal product may induce temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances which may 
affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or 
use machines until their vision has cleared. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions with Verkazia are eye pain (11%) and eye pruritus (9%) which 
are usually transitory and occurred during instillation.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Systemic exposure to Verkazia following topical ocular administration has been shown to be 
negligible. If overdose with Verkazia occurs, it may be flushed from the eye(s) with water and 
treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, other ophthalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA18. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Following ocular administration, ciclosporin is passively absorbed by T-lymphocytes where its 
binding to cyclophilin A inactivates calcineurin, and prevents nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-
AT) translocation into the nucleus, thus blocking the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-2 and hence T-lymphocyte activation. Blocking NF-AT also interferes in the allergy process. 
Ciclosporin inhibits histamine release from mast cells and basophils through a reduction in IL-5 
production, and may reduce eosinophil recruitment and effects on the conjunctiva and cornea. 
Ciclosporin is also known to up-regulate the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. All available 
evidence suggests that ciclosporin acts specifically and reversibly on lymphocytes and does not 
depress haematopoiesis or have any effect on the function of phagocytic cells. 
Clinical efficacy 
In a 12 month double-masked, vehicle controlled, pivotal clinical trial (VEKTIS study), 169 patients 
with severe VKC and severe keratitis (grade 4 or 5 on the modified Oxford scale) were randomised to 
4 drops of Verkazia (high dose) or 2 drops of Verkazia (low dose) and 2 drops of vehicle or 4 drops of 
vehicle for the first 4 months (Period 1). Patients randomised to the vehicle group were switched to 
Verkazia (four times or twice daily) from Month 4 to Month 12 (Period 2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
168 patients [127 children (75.6%) and 41 adolescents (24.4%)] were included in the efficacy 
analyses. Mean age was 9.2 years (SD: 3.3, age range: 4-17 years). There were more male 
[n=132 (78.6%)] than female patients [n=36 (21.4%)]. 
The primary efficacy endpoint which was the average penalties adjusted change of the Corneal 
Fluorescein Staining (CFS) score from baseline and over Period 1, considered all patients (n=168). 
Efficacy was assessed every month during the 4 month treatment period and compared with baseline 
using a composite criterion based on keratitis assessed by the modified Oxford scale, the need for 
rescue medicinal product (use of topical steroids) and the occurrence of corneal ulceration. 
The difference in the Least Square (LS) mean vs. vehicle was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.27) for the high 
dose group and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.16, 1.18) for the low dose group. Both differences were statistically 
significant with p=0.007 for the high dose and p=0.010 for the low dose group. 
Clinical relevance of the primary efficacy endpoint was however difficult to address. In that context, 
responder rate’s results were considered as more reliable endpoint. A responder was defined as a 
patient 1) with a mean CFS score over the 4 months of treatment ≤ 50% of baseline, 2) who did not 
withdraw from the study for a reason possibly due to treatment, 3) with no experience of corneal 
ulceration and 4) no use of rescue medicinal product in the last 4 months of treatment. There was a 
significantly higher number of CFS responders in both active groups as compared to vehicle (p=0.005 
for the high dose group, and p=0.010 for the low dose group) with 55.4%, 50.0% and 27.6% of 
responders in the high dose, low dose and vehicle groups respectively. The excess rate with respect to 
vehicle was 27.8% for the high dose regimen and 22.4% for the low dose one. 
Rescue medicinal product (topical steroids) was used more often in the vehicle than in the high dose 
regimen: 32.1% in the high dose group and 31.5% in the low dose group received at least one course 
of rescue medicinal product while they were 53.4% in the vehicle group. 
All four symptoms (photophobia, tearing, itching and mucous discharge) improved over time and the 
difference from baseline at Month 4 for each symptom largely exceeded 10 mm. 
For the average of VKC symptoms, the difference in the LS mean vs. vehicle in the high dose group 
was statistically significant at all time points compared to vehicle: -19.4 mm (p<0.05). 
Patient quality of life (Quick questionnaire) improved significantly better in the high dose group 
compared to vehicle. The improvement was clinically relevant as illustrated by the effect size over 
4 months (symptoms domain: 0.67 and daily activities domain: 0.44). 
In Period 2, analyses demonstrated stability of improvements achieved during Period 1 for both doses 
regimen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Formal pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in humans with Verkazia. 
Blood concentrations of Verkazia were measured using a specific high-pressure liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In 166 patients at baseline from one efficacy study 
(55 patients in the high dose group, 53 in the low dose group and 58 in the vehicle group), plasma 
concentrations of ciclosporin were measured before administration and after 2, 4 and 12 months of 
treatment. 
In the high dose group after 4 months of ocular instillation of Verkazia 4 times daily, the maximum 
quantifiable value detected in the 14 patients who had quantifiable levels of cyclosporine was 
0.670 ng/mL which is considered to be a negligible value. At Month 12, the maximum quantifiable 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value detected in the 12 patients who had quantifiable levels of cyclosporine was 0.291 ng/mL which 
is considered to be a negligible value. 
In the low dose group, after 4 months of ocular instillation of Verkazia 2 times daily, the maximum 
quantifiable value detected in the 5 patients who had quantifiable levels of cyclosporine was 
0.336 ng/mL which is considered to be a negligible value. At Month 12, the maximum quantifiable 
value detected in the 5 patients who had quantifiable levels of cyclosporine was 0.300 ng/mL which is 
considered to be a negligible value. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, phototoxicity and photoallergy, genotoxicity, carcinogenic 
potential, toxicity to reproduction and development.

168 patients [127 children (75.6%) and 41 adolescents (24.4%)] were included in the efficacy 
analyses. Mean age was 9.2 years (SD: 3.3, age range: 4-17 years). There were more male 
[n=132 (78.6%)] than female patients [n=36 (21.4%)].

The difference in the Least Square (LS) mean vs. vehicle was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.27) for the high 
dose group and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.16, 1.18) for the low dose group. Both differences were statistically

regimen: 32.1% in the high dose group and 31.5% in the low dose group received at least one course 
of rescue medicinal product while they were 53.4% in the vehicle group. 
All four symptoms (photophobia, tearing, itching and mucous discharge) improved over time and the 
difference from baseline at Month 4 for each symptom largely exceeded 10 mm. 
For the average of VKC symptoms, the difference in the LS mean vs. vehicle in the high dose group 
was statistically significant at all time points compared to vehicle: -19.4 mm (p<0.05). 
Patient quality of life (Quick questionnaire) improved significantly better in the high dose group

(55 patients in the high dose group, 53 in the low dose group and 58 in the vehicle group), plasma 
concentrations of ciclosporin were measured before administration and after 2, 4 and 12 months of 
treatment. 
In the high dose group after 4 months of ocular instillation of Verkazia 4 times daily, the maximum

2.  What you need to know before you use Verkazia 
3.  How to use Verkazia 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Verkazia 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Verkazia is and what it is used for 
Verkazia contains the active ingredient, ciclosporin. Ciclosporin reduces the activity of the body’s 
immune (defence) system and in this way it reduces inflammation (body response to harmful stimuli). 
Verkazia is used to treat children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years with severe vernal 
keratoconjunctivitis (an allergic condition of the eye that occurs more frequently in spring and affects 
the transparent layer in the front part of the eye and the thin membrane covering the front part of the 
eye). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Verkazia 
Do not use Verkazia 
- 
if you are allergic to ciclosporin or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have had or have a cancer in or around your eye. 
if you have an eye infection. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Only use Verkazia in your eye as described under section 3. Do not exceed the treatment period 
prescribed by your doctor. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Verkazia: 
- 
- 
- 
if you have had an eye infection or if you suspect you have an eye infection. 
if you have any other kind of eye disease. 
if you wear contact lenses (the use of Verkazia is not recommended with contact lenses). 
Children and adolescents 
Do not use Verkazia in children under the age of 4 years. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Verkazia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Talk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids administered in association with 
Verkazia as this association may increase the risk of local infections. 
If you are using Verkazia for more than 12 months, you should visit your doctor regularly, e.g. every 
3 to 6 months. 
If you are using other eye drops, use Verkazia at least 15 minutes after using the other eye drops. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Verkazia should not be used if you are pregnant. If you could become pregnant you must use 
contraception while using this medicine. 
Verkazia is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to 
your doctor before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be temporarily blurred after using Verkazia eye drops or you may get other 
disturbances with your vision. If this happens, wait until your vision clears before you drive or use 
machines. 
Verkazia contains cetalkonium chloride  
Cetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation. 
3. 
How to use Verkazia 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
A caregiver should help a child starting Verkazia treatment, particularly if the child is aged under 
10 years, and should continue to supervise the child until the child is able to use Verkazia properly 
without help. 
The recommended dose is 1 drop of Verkazia in each affected eye 4 times a day (morning, mid-day, 
afternoon and evening). You should continue Verkazia as prescribed by your doctor. 
Instructions for use 
Follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not 
understand. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Wash your hands. 
2.  Open the aluminium pouch, which contains 5 single-dose containers. 
3.  Take one single-dose container from the aluminium pouch, leaving the remaining 
containers in the pouch. 
4.  Gently shake the single-dose container. 
5.  Twist off the cap (picture 1). 
6.  Pull down your lower eyelid (picture 2). 
7.  Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling. 
8.  Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye. Make sure that the tip of the 
single-dose container does not touch your eye. 
9.  Blink a few times so that the medicine spreads across your eye. 
10.  After using Verkazia, press a finger lightly on the inner corner of your eyelid, next to your 
nose for 2 minutes (picture 3). A small duct that drains tears away from your eye and into 
your nose is located here. By pressing at this point, you close down the opening of this 
drainage duct. This helps to stop Verkazia getting into the rest of the body. 
11.  If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps 6 to 9 for your other eye. 
12.  Discard the single-dose container as soon as you have used it, even if there is still some 
medicine left in it. 
If a drop misses your eye, try again. 
If you put in more Verkazia than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more 
drops until it is time for your next regular dose. 
If you forget to use Verkazia, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not take a double dose 
to make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than 1 drop 4 times a day in the affected eye(s). 
If you stop using Verkazia without speaking to your doctor, your eye allergy will not be controlled 
and could lead to long-term problems with your sight. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

3. 
How to use Verkazia 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
A caregiver should help a child starting Verkazia treatment, particularly if the child is aged under 
10 years, and should continue to supervise the child until the child is able to use Verkazia properly 
without help. 
The recommended dose is 1 drop of Verkazia in each affected eye 4 times a day (morning, mid-day, 
afternoon and evening). You should continue Verkazia as prescribed by your doctor. 
Instructions for use 
Follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not 
understand. 
Before administration of the eye drops: 
•  Wash your hands before opening the bottle. 
• 
Do not use this medicine if you notice that the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken 
before you first use it. 
•  When using the bottle for the very first time, before delivering a drop to the eye, you should 
practise using the bottle by squeezing it slowly to deliver one drop away from the eye. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  When you are confident that you can deliver one drop at a time, choose the position that you 
find most comfortable for the instillation of the drops (you can sit down, lie on your back, or 
stand in front of a mirror).  
Every time when opening a new bottle, place one drop in the waste to activate the bottle. 
• 
Administration: 
1. 
Gently shake the bottle. Hold the bottle directly below the cap and turn the cap to open the 
bottle. Do not touch anything with the tip of the bottle to avoid contamination. 
2. 
3. 
Tilt your head backwards and hold the bottle above your eye. 
Pull the lower eyelid down and look up. Squeeze the bottle gently in the middle and let a drop 
fall into your eye. Please note that there might be a few seconds delay between squeezing and 
the drop coming out. Do not squeeze too hard. 
4. 
Close your eye and press the inner corner of the eye with your finger for about two minutes. 
This helps to stop the medicine from getting into the rest of the body. 
5. 
Repeat instructions 2 – 4 to deliver a drop into the other eye, if your doctor has instructed you 
to do this. Sometimes only one eye needs to be treated and your doctor will advise if this 
applies to you and which eye needs treatment.

6. 
After each use and prior to recapping, the bottle should be shaken once in a downwards 
direction, without touching the dropper tip, in order to remove any residual emulsion from the 
tip. This is necessary to ensure good delivery of the next drop. 
7. 
Wipe off any excess emulsion from the skin around the eye. 
At the end of the 4 weeks in-use shelf life of the medicine, there will be some emulsion left in the 
bottle. Do not attempt to use the excess medicine remaining in the bottle after you have completed the 
course of treatment. Do not use the eye drops for longer than 4 weeks after first opening the bottle. 
If a drop misses your eye, try again. 
If you put in more Verkazia than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more 
drops until it is time for your next regular dose. 
If you forget to use Verkazia, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not take a double dose 
to make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than 1 drop 4 times a day in the affected eye(s). 
If you stop using Verkazia without speaking to your doctor, your eye allergy will not be controlled 
and could lead to long-term problems with your sight. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Hetlioz in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

SmPC 
Data presented showed that the concomitant 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
administration of tasimelteon with inducers or inhibitors of 
CYP2C19 is not expected to alter plasma concentrations or 
exposure of tasimelteon or its metabolites in a clinically 
meaningful way. Therefore a healthy volunteer study to 
investigate the CYP2C19 Drug-Drug Interaction potential is 
not needed. 
Caution should be used when administering Hetlioz in 
combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 
inhibitors, particularly those which also inhibit other 
enzymes involved in the clearance of Hetlioz because of a 
potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and 
Page 5/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
greater risk of adverse reactions. 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are enzymes identified to play a role 
in the metabolism of tasimelteon, with a minor role for 
CYP2C9/C19. Medicinal products that inhibit CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 have been shown to alter the metabolism of 
tasimelteon in vivo. 
Caution should be used when administering tasimelteon in 
combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 
inhibitors such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin because of a 
potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and 
greater risk of adverse reactions: the AUC0-inf and Cmax 
of tasimelteon increased by 7-fold and 2-fold, respectively, 
when co-administered with fluvoxamine 50 mg (after 6 
days of fluvoxamine 50 mg per day). This is deemed even 
more important for strong CYP1A2 inhibitors also inhibiting 
other enzymes involved in the clearance of HETLIOZ (e.g. 
fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin). 
Tasimelteon is extensively metabolised. Metabolism of 
tasimelteon consists primarily of oxidation at multiple sites 
and oxidative dealkylation resulting in opening of the 
dihydrofuran ring followed by further oxidation to give a 
carboxylic acid. CYP1A2 (35.4%) and CYP3A4 (24.3%) are 
the major enzymes identified to play a role in the 
metabolism of tasimelteon.  CYP2C9 (18.8%) and CYP2C19 
(15.1%) also contribute to the metabolism of tasimelteon. 
Tasimelteon clearance does not appear to be affected by 
polymorphisms in these enzymes.

In order to address concerns regarding the phototoxicity 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
potential of tasimelteon and its main metabolites, the 
of studies to the competent authority 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has submitted three 
in vitro studies in fulfilment of post authorisation measure 
Page 6/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MEA 004. First, the MAH conducted a study to determine 
the molar extinction coefficient for tasimelteon and its main 
metabolites (Study VCR-TMI-121012). Molar extinction 
coefficient (MEC) values for metabolites M3, M12, and M13 
were above 1000 L/mol/cm. Therefore, further testing was 
undertaken with these metabolites in an in vitro 
phototoxicity test as recommended by the ICH Guideline 
S10. Subsequently two studies were conducted to assess 
the phototoxicity potential of tasimelteon’s metabolites 
M12, M14, and M3 (TAJ0044 and TAJ0045). The results of 
the in vitro tests indicated that metabolites M3, M12 and 
M14 do not show phototoxic potential in the UVA range of 
315 – 380 nm. However, the findings were limited to the 
UVA range as the metabolites absorb at approximately 290 
nm which is below the threshold of compounds that 
warrant phototoxicity testing, metabolites (in-line with ICH 
Guidance S10) generally do not warrant separate 
photosafety assessments, as metabolism does not typically 
result in chromophores that are substantially different from 
those in the parent molecule and there have been no 
phototoxic signals seen in patients in the post-marketing 
data collected so far. No further phototoxicity testing is 
required.

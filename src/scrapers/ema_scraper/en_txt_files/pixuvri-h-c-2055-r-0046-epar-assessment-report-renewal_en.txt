1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 10 May 2012, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for Pixuvri This 
implied that, pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation 
(EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct 
new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the 
basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A  conditional  MA  is  valid  for  one  year  and  may  be  renewed  annually  upon  request  by  the  MAH.  Therefore, 
pursuant to Article 14 (7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
507/2006, the MAH CTI Life Sciences Limited, submitted to the Agency on 30 November 2018 an application for 
renewal of the conditional MA for Pixuvri. The expiry date of the MA is 14 May 2019. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 1 September 2017 to 31 August 2018. 
The  application  contained  a  justification  in  support  of  the  possible  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  no 
longer subject to specific obligations. 
2.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
2.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During  the  period  covered  by  this  annual  renewal  data  on  the  SOBs  have  been  submitted  that overall  are 
compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines. 
Updated list of specific obligations (SOBs) 
None remaining. 
2.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have been reported from the trial conducted as part 
of the SOBs. These data are considered comprehensive in the sense of the CMA regulation, as well as supportive 
of the positive benefit-risk of Pixuvri in the approved indication. 
Treatment of patients with relapsed DLBCL is challenging. If treatment with the currently most effective regimen 
in the first line (R-CHOP) fails to provide cure, the probability of achieving long-term disease suppression or cure 
with second or further lines of treatment is low. A potentially curative second line treatment is salvage 
chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, significant associated 
toxicities preclude proceeding for a substantial fraction of patients, with comorbidities or advanced age, to this 
procedure. 
Recently, two CAR-T cell immunotherapies (Yescarta and Kymriah) were authorised in the EU for patients with 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy which are intended for patients with 
sufficient disease control to await the manufacturing times and who are able to tolerate the conditioning 
regimen. The use of these products is associated with life-threatening and in some cases even fatal toxicities, 
excluding the patient population for whom ASCT is not an option.

Pixuvri was approved in 2012 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or 
refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL) with palliative intent approach as a third or fourth 
line treatment. 
With the results from study PIX306 the benefit of pixantrone in patients who had received prior treatment with 
rituximab would be corroborated and the requirement to convert a conditional MA into a full MA (that is, without 
specific obligations) fulfilled. 
The MAH has now provided results from study PIX 306: “A Randomized Multicentre Study Comparing Pixantrone 
+ Rituximab with Gemcitabine + Rituximab in Patients with Aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Who 
Have Relapsed after Therapy with CHOP-R or an Equivalent Regimen and are Ineligible for Stem Cell 
Transplant”, and applies for the full marketing authorization of pixantrone for the approved indication. 
Study PIX306 background 
A conditional approval for pixantrone was granted in 2012 because additional efficacy data was needed to 
confirm the benefit of pixantrone in patients who had received prior treatment with rituximab. In Study PIX 301, 
pivotal for the conditional approval, only 54% (38 patients) in the pixantrone treatment group had received 
rituximab therapy prior to study entry. In Europe, rituximab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy has been 
a standard first line treatment in DLBCL after the EU approval of this DLBCL indication for rituximab in March 
2002. 
At that time, efficacy was based on the abovementioned single pivotal trial showing higher response rates at the 
end of treatment and also at the end of the follow up, with statistically significant improvement of PFS but not 
OS (both PFS and OS were secondary efficacy endpoints). 
PIX306 was already underway in 2012 at the time of conditional approval. Despite the different patient 
population compared to PIX 301 (1-3 prior regimens vs. 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy, and 
combination therapy with rituximab vs. pixantrone single agent), this phase III study was considered 
appropriate to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy of pixantrone in patients that had received prior 
rituximab treatment, because all patients had to have received rituximab (as part of R-CHOP) before study 
entry. 
Study plan 
Study PIX306 was designed, prior to the CMA, to show superiority of pixantrone + rituximab over gemcitabine 
+ rituximab in patients previously treated with at least 1 prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen and 
ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. 
Similar to PIX301, up to 6 cycles of 28 days of treatment were planned to be administered. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria of the study PIX306 seemed representative of a population of subjects with relapsed DLBCL. 
There were several differences in the inclusion and exclusion criteria when comparing studies 306 and 301, as 
highlighted below. 
The most significant difference is number of prior therapies allowed: 1-3 prior regimens for DLBCL in study 
PIX306 vs. relapse after 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy in study PIX301. Other important 
difference was the requirement that all patients in study PIX306 should have received a rituximab-containing 
multi-agent regimen, while in study PIX 301 patients must have received rituximab in prior regimens in those 
countries where it was the standard of care and available at the patient’s institution. 
Importantly, patients with prior treatment with a cumulative dose of doxorubicin or equivalent exceeding 
450 mg/m² were excluded from both studies. There was a minor difference in the LVEF-criteria by 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 6/107 
  
  
echocardiogram: in study 306 patients with LVEF < 45% were excluded, in study 301 the LVEF had to be ≥ 50%. 
The dose of pixantrone (in combination with rituximab) was identical compared to the dose administered in the 
pivotal study PIX301. The dose of rituximab was identical compared to dose used the in combination with CHOP 
chemotherapy in first line treatment. Basically all patients receive rituximab in first line and in case of relapse 
many patients develop disease that is refractory to rituximab. Combining pixantrone chemotherapy with the 
anti-CD20 agent rituximab was expected to produce synergistic effects. However, the role of rituximab in 
salvage treatment (like here in combination with either pixantrone or gemcitabine) in second or further line 
treatment is not clear. 
The choice of the comparator, gemcitabine, was acceptable at the time study PIX306 was initiated. At that time 
there were no approved second-line treatments in relapsed DLBCL and gemcitabine had been shown to have at 
least some effect in the treatment of patients with relapsed DLBCL. 
PFS is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint in this setting, with OS as a key secondary endpoint. PFS has 
been previously approved as a measure of the clinical efficacy of therapy in comparable oncological and 
haematological settings. 
The timetable and monitoring of the treatment efficacy with the disease assessments by CT, PET (at the end of 
study visit) and bone marrow biopsy (at the end of study visit, unless negative at baseline) are acceptable and 
follow the current guidelines for evaluating treatment response in DLBCL. 
Final sample size calculations, planning to show superiority of the pixantrone + rituximab treatment-arm, were 
acceptable for both PFS and OS. Selected randomization procedure with the proposed stratifications was 
appropriate. The sponsor was blinded during the study until the core database lock which is appropriate in this 
type of study.  
Based on subject selection, the study results (PIX306) can be generalised to the European DLBCL patients. This 
is important, because in the pivotal study PIX301, only 38/140 patients were recruited in “Western Europe”. This 
could possibly explain the lower than expected use of rituximab (already approved 3/2002 in EU) in the first line 
treatment of patients recruited into the study PIX301. 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 312 patients were randomized in this study: 155 patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group and 157 
in the gemcitabine + rituximab group 
Overall only 42.6% of patients completed the planned treatment (6 cycles of 28 days each) in study PIX306, 
with consent withdrawal being the reason for higher number of discontinuation in the gemcitabine + rituximab 
group (10.2% vs. 3.7%). In total 61.1% in the gemcitabine + rituximab group vs. 53.5% in the pixantrone + 
rituximab discontinued treatment, mostly due to progressive disease. 
Overall, the total number of protocol deviations was high. The MAH was asked to summarise the number of 
patients in each category of major protocol deviations (including dosing errors) per treatment arm. As a 
response to the questions regarding the protocol violations, the MAH has submitted a summary table of subjects 
with major protocol deviations from the ITT population. The majority of major deviations were related to study 
drug administration and protocol non-adherence. The numbers of these major deviations are equally distributed 
between the two treatment arms. Importantly, none of the protocol deviations led to patient withdrawal from 
the study. 
There were no discernible differences between the populations in the two treatment arms in the study PIX306 
concerning demographic and baseline characteristics as well as baseline disease characteristics. The overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 7/107 
  
  
population with median age of 73 years represents typical DLBCL patients. The baseline performance status 
(ECOG) was also comparable between the two treatment groups. 
The main difference between studies PIX301 and PIX306 was the number of previous chemotherapy regimens. 
Most of patients have had only 1 previous therapy is study PIX306 (54.8%) while all patients had had at least 2, 
and 55% of the patients 3 to 5 prior regimens in study PIX301. 
The listing of previous therapies and especially the use of previous cardiotoxic treatments was comprehensively 
presented (in Tables 5.12-5.14) from study PIX 301. Importantly, similar detailed presentation of prior NHL 
therapies in patients with DLBCL from study PIX306 and especially category of prior chemotherapies was initially 
missing. Almost all patients have received previous treatment with anthracyclines; 148 (95.5%) in the 
pixantrone + R-arm and 143 (91.1%) in the gemcitabine + R-arm. In addition, regarding all other previous 
treatments, the use of different prior DLBCL therapies are equally balanced between the two treatment arms. 
Surprisingly high numbers of patients were excluded from the histology-confirmed ITT (HITT) population. This 
highlights the importance of reliable pathological diagnosis of an aggressive disease like DLBCL. There is a slight 
imbalance between the treatment groups regarding this HITT population; 128 patients in the pixantrone + 
rituximab group vs. 140 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
28 patients (almost 10% of the total patient population) were excluded from the PP population for major 
protocol violations. The most important reasons for these exclusions were related to baseline tumour 
assessment/ tumour response assessment after randomization. All patients were adequately excluded from the 
PP population following the exclusion rules of the SAP. 
Efficacy 
The primary endpoint IRC-assessed PFS was not met; median PFS was 7.3 months in the pixantrone + rituximab 
group versus 6.3 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab group, p=0.2782 and HR 0.85 (0.64 - 1.14). In 
addition, all sensitivity analyses were in line with the primary analysis with no significant statistical differences 
between the two treatment groups. The results from the subgroup analysis of PFS per IRC assessment produced 
mixed results with hazard ratios favouring variably the pixantrone + R arm or the comparator arm. However, 
there were no clear differences in any subgroup analysis. 
The median of PFS in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy (like in the population in the pivotal study PIX301) 
was 3.9 months in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 4.4 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab group.  
Result from the first interim analysis showed a median OS of 13.3 months in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
versus 19.6 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. This difference was not statistically significant with 
HR of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.66-1.26), unstratified log-rank test p= 0.43). The final OS analysis was done using the 
final cut-off date of September, 14 2018. Six (6) additional OS events (3 in each arm) were included in this final 
OS analysis; 183 deaths had occurred with a median OS of 13.5 months in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
group versus 19.6 months in the gemcitabine + R group. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.13 (95%CI [0.84 - 
1.53]). 
The results from the subgroup analysis of OS were consistent across most of the subgroups and with the results 
of the overall population analysis 
The median of OS in patients with ≥2 prior lines of therapy (like in the population in the pivotal study PIX301) 
was 10.1 months in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 10.5 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab 
group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 8/107 
  
  
While the OS HR point estimate was on the wrong side of unity (HR 1.13), the confidence intervals are very wide. 
While information on post progression therapies is not available, there were no new safety concerns identified 
which would support a true detrimental effect on OS.  
The ORR and CR rate (key secondary endpoints) were both significantly higher in the pixantrone + rituximab 
group compared to the gemcitabine + rituximab group (61.9% vs. 43.9%, p=0.0007, and 35.5% vs. 21.7%, 
p=0.0047).  
In the pivotal study PIX301 for the initial marketing authorisation, the CR/CFu-rate was the primary efficacy 
endpoint, with CR/CFu-rate of 20% for single-agent pixantrone. In the corresponding subgroup of patients with 
≥2 lines of prior therapy in the current study PIX306, the CR-rate was 22.6% in the pixantrone + rituximab 
group compared to 7.8% in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
There were no significant differences in the duration of overall response or duration of complete response 
between the two treatment groups. 
Safety 
The pivotal study PIX301 for the CMA involved 68 subjects receiving pixantrone monotherapy. In Study PIX306 
pixantrone was combined with rituximab for 153 patients, which slightly complicates the comparison of the 
adverse event profiles of pixantrone between the two studies. 
In both studies, the pixantrone doses were reduced due to mainly tolerability issues. In PIX306 54.2% of 
patients received less than 70% of the protocol dose. Only 50.3% of the patients received 6 out of 6 study cycles 
as per protocol. For gemcitabine combined with rituximab, the dose reductions were even more frequently 
needed: 73.2% received less than 70% of the protocol dose and 43.6% of the patients went through 6 out of 6 
study cycles. 
The observed dose reductions of pixantrone in the clinical studies, and clinical use and the consequences to 
efficacy/safety of pixantrone, are being evaluated in the recently initiated legally binding procedure (LEG, see 
Section 6.5 of this AR). 
There were some notable differences in the TEAE profiles between the treatments. Neutropenia was more 
common in pixantrone +rituximab group, and anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia in gemcitabine + 
rituximab groups. These differences were also reflected to the number of transfusions the patients needed (any 
transfusion 8.5% vs 30.2%, platelets 0% vs 6.0%, RBCs 8.5% vs 28.9%, respectively) and to the use of growth 
factors (filgrastim was given to 66.0% and pegfilgrastim to 11.8% of pixantrone + rituximab patients, and to 
47.7% and 4.7% of the gemcitabine + rituximab patients respectively). 
Stomatitis, oral candidiasis, dysgeusia, and anorexia were more common in patients receiving pixantrone + 
rituximab. Skin discolouration affected 9.2% of pixantrone + rituximab patients and 0.7% of gemcitabine + 
rituximab patients. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in study PIX306 patients receiving pixantrone + rituximab was comparable to 
that of study PIX301 patients receiving pixantrone monotherapy, 91.5% vs. 97.1%. For grade 3 to 4 TEAEs the 
figures were 85.0% and 76.5% implying to a worse tolerability of the combination therapy. E.g., neutropenia 
63.4% vs. 41.2%, anaemia 17.0% vs. 5.9%, or lymphopenia, 5.9% vs. 2.9%, in PIX306 vs. PIX301, 
respectively. However, these trends were reversed when looking at the SAEs. 
The percentage of on-treatment deaths was lower in PIX306 patients receiving pixantrone + rituximab 
compared to PIX301 patients receiving pixantrone monotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 9/107 
  
  
The incidences of serious treatment emergent adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment 
groups in study PIX306, including cardiotoxicity. 
There were no significant differences in the blood chemistry abnormalities between the treatment groups in 
PIX306. No hepatorenal toxicity was reported. 
Close follow-up of haematology parameters (4 cases of myelodysplasia were reported from pixantrone patients) 
and LVEF seems necessary during pixantrone + rituximab therapy. 
The rate of discontinuations due to TEAEs was lower in study PIX306 patients receiving pixantrone + rituximab 
compared to study PIX301 patients receiving only pixantrone (42.6% vs. 21.6%), which also implies to not 
worse tolerability of the combination treatment compared to monotherapy. 
No new safety concerns for pixantrone were identified. 
Other relevant studies 
Study AZA302 
The population recruited into study AZA302 consisted of relapsed follicular lymphoma patients. The prognosis 
and estimated treatment efficacy in second line is much higher compared to patients with relapsed, more 
aggressive lymphoma, DLBCL. 
In this study, pixantrone + rituximab performed better than rituximab alone, but it is difficult to draw 
conclusions from this very small study (38 patients) with different patient population than in studies PIX301 and 
PIX306. 
Favourable effects 
Current indication: “Pixuvri is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of pixantrone treatment 
has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in patients who are 
refractory to last therapy.”

The advantage of pixantrone over comparator detected in the ITT population is lower in the group of patients 
pre-treated with rituximab and diminishes further with increasing number of prior regimens. Pixantrone showed 
to be more active than the comparator in the group of patients pretreated with up to 3 regimens, including 
rituximab. However, the benefit in this subset needs to be further confirmed in view of the low number of 
patients.  
PIX306 
The primary efficacy endpoint in PIX306 PFS did not show statistically significant superiority of pixantrone + 
rituximab over pixantrone + gemcitabine, nor did OS.

For the most part, pixantrone vs. comparator and pixantrone-rituximab vs. gemcitabine + rituximab had similar 
ADR-potential. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Consistent dose reductions in both clinical studies and in clinical use pose a question about optimal dose, efficacy 
and safety - a LEG-procedure has been initiated by PRAC. The assessment is currently under way. 
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The original positive opinion of pixantrone was based on the pivotal study PIX301 where an improvement was 
seen in CR/Cru, supported by the result of secondary endpoint, PFS. Two CAR-T cell immunotherapies were 
recently authorized in EU, targeting patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy, indication being partly comparable to pixantrone. However, these products are not an option 
for all patients due to tolerability and availability issues.  
In study PIX306, all patients were previously treated with rituximab. While the superiority of pixantrone + 
rituximab over comparator was not met, both PFS and OS results in patients with ≥ 2 prior treatment lines are 
roughly similar to that of the active comparator. 
There were no new toxicity concerns regarding pixantrone. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
The request to the MAH was to provide comprehensive data relevant to the approved indication, with particular 
respect to activity in patients pretreated with rituximab, which was specifically identified as non-comprehensive.  
The MAH has provided the requested data. The study included a broader patient population than covered by the 
authorisation (1-3 prior regimens vs. 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy) and a more intensive therapy 
(combination therapy of pixantrone + rituximab vs. pixantrone monotherapy). 
If the results from the same patient population (patients with ≥2 prior treatment lines) are compared indirectly, 
activity is roughly similar. Results are compatible with a conclusion that pixantrone is efficacious also in patients 
who had received prior rituximab; taking into account that prior rituximab was part of an intensive, standard 
regimen (R-CHOP). From the data provided, it is not possible to conclude, whether rituximab has an additive 
value in combination with pixantrone in the second or further line treatment in relapsed DLBCL, in patients who 
have experienced disease progression despite prior treatment with rituximab.  
The benefit-risk balance in the originally approved indication remains positive and is corroborated by the data 
from the study PIX306, a specific obligation to the initial conditional marketing authorisation. The MAH is 
considered to have provided comprehensive data through the designated specific obligation on which the CMA 
was contingent. B/R remains positive in the approved indication. The conversion of the CMA to FMA is therefore 
recommended. 
Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation 
not subject to specific obligations 
The result of study PIX306 support that pixantrone is efficacious in patients with multiply relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL  after  rituximab  treatment.  This  conclusion  meets  the  specific  obligation  of  the  conditional  marketing 
Assessment report

authorisation.  The  data  submitted  at  the  time  of  the  marketing  authorisation  were  not  comprehensive  with 
regards to patients previously treated with rituximab, which is part of standard of care in first line treatment of 
DLBCL.  
The result of study PIX306 corroborate the benefit of pixantrone in the authorised indication, including patients 
previously treated with rituximab, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or 
refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (NHL).  
Therefore, there are no further obligations in respect of using pixantrone in the authorised indication and the 
marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations can be granted.  
3.  Recommendations 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  available  information  on  the  status  of  the  fulfilment  of  Specific  Obligations,  the 
benefit-risk  balance  for  Pixuvri  in  its  approved  indication  (please  refer  to  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics) continues to be favourable and all specific obligations have been fulfilled, and therefore  the 
granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations is recommended, subject to the 
conditions and obligations as detailed in this assessment report. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of new data submitted as part of the renewal application, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to 
the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Please refer to the Attachment which includes comments to the proposed changes to the Product Information. 
Conditions of the marketing authorisation

Summary 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP considered 
that,  as  all  Specific  Obligations  have  been  fulfilled,  there  are  no  remaining  grounds  for  the  marketing 
authorisations to remain conditional and therefore recommends the granting of the MA no longer subject to 
Specific Obligations for Pixuvri.

Since the granting of the conditional MA, the MAH has submitted the following SOBs: 
•  SOB  001:  A  randomised  controlled  Phase  3  study  (PIX306)  of  pixantrone-  rituximab  vs 
gemcitabine-rituximab in patients with aggressive B-cell NHL, who failed front line CHOP-R who are not

study report has been submitted. 
5.2.  Outstanding Specific Obligations – status report for period covered 
SOB 01 Clinical Study PIX 306 
This was an international, phase III, multicentre, randomized (1:1 ratio), active-controlled study, blinded for the 
sponsor, evaluating the efficacy of pixantrone + rituximab versus gemcitabine + rituximab. The randomization 
was stratified by the number of prior therapies for DLBCL or FL grade 3 (0-2 versus ≥ 3), International Prognostic 
Index (IPI) score (0-2 versus ≥ 3), and length of time from initiation of first-line therapy for DLBCL or FL grade 
3 until first relapse (< 1 year versus ≥ 1 year). 
Adult patients with DLBCL (either de novo or transformed from indolent lymphoma), or FL grade 3 on the basis 
of a tissue biopsy who had relapsed after at least 1 prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen and who 
were currently ineligible for high-dose (myeloablative) chemotherapy and ASCT. 
Patients with de novo DLBCL or FL grade 3 should not have had a primary refractory disease, which was defined 
in the protocol as documented progression within 12 weeks of the last cycle of the first-line multi-agent regimen. 
Patients with DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma should have had a complete or partial response to a 
therapy for NHL lasting at least 12 weeks. The study plan is presented in Figure 5.1. 
Additionally,  PIX306  included  a  PK  substudy  to  compare  pixantrone  concentrations  in  PIX306  patients  who 
received rituximab to concentration predictions from an earlier developed population PK model of individuals 
who did not received routine rituximab therapy.

The underlying research hypothesis for this study was that the combination of pixantrone + rituximab would 
have a higher efficiency than treatment with gemcitabine + rituximab in patients with DLBCL (or FL grade 3) 
who  were  not  eligible  for  high-dose  myeloablative  chemotherapy  and  SCT.  Indeed,  no  therapy  has 
demonstrated a survival prolongation in this patient population, and thus there is no standard of care. 
The EMA granted a conditional approval for pixantrone with the specific obligation to conduct this phase III study 
(PIX306) to confirm the efficacy of pixantrone in patients previously treated with rituximab. Since PIX306 was 
originally designed as a request by the FDA for pixantrone new application with OS as primary endpoint and was 
already underway at the time of conditional approval, it was modified by amendment. 
The analysis plan was thus subject to various changes following authorities’ requests and enrolment issues. In 
the original protocol, the primary study endpoint was PFS, but this was changed before the start of recruitment 
(Amendment No. 2) to combined primary of PFS and OS (with a resulting modification of the size of the patient 
population). Amendment 4 changed the primary endpoint to OS only (as requested by the US Food and Drug 
Administration [FDA]) with PFS as a secondary endpoint. In agreement with the EMA, Amendment 8 changed 
the primary endpoint back to PFS (due to enrolment difficulties). The target population size was increased by 
Amendment 9 in order to reach the required 195 PFS events as assessed by the IRC. Following the analysis of 
the primary endpoint of this study, it was decided by the Sponsor not to continue the study until the target 
220 events for the OS analysis, analysis, but terminate it within six months of the data cut-off date (the actual 
date was 14 September 2018). For rest of the amendments, refer to section “Conduct of the study” below. 
A GCP-inspection of CTI Biopharma clinical trial PIX306 was conducted by the MHRA in December 2018 and the 
inspection report is expected by the end of January 2019. 
comment 
A  conditional  approval  for  pixantrone  was  granted  in  2012  because  additional  efficacy  data  was  needed  to 
confirm the benefit of pixantrone in patients that had received prior treatment with rituximab. In the pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 18/107 
  
  
 
study PIX301, only 54.3% (38 patients) in the pixantrone treatment group received rituximab therapy prior to 
study entry. 
In addition, efficacy was supported by a small single pivotal trial showing statistical significance in PFS but not 
in OS (both PFS and OS were secondary efficacy endpoints). 
In Europe, rituximab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy has been a standard first line treatment in DLBCL 
after the EC approval of this DLBCL indication for rituximab in March 2002. 
Clinical study PIX 306 was already underway in 2012 at the time of conditional approval and despite the different 
patient population compared to PIX301 (1-3 prior regimens vs. 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy, and 
combination  therapy  with  rituximab  vs.  pixantrone  single  agent),  this  phase  III  study  was  considered 
appropriate to support the efficacy of pixantrone in patients that had received prior rituximab treatment. 
Study  PIX  306  was  originally  planned  to  show  superiority  of  pixantrone  +  rituximab  versus  gemcitabine  + 
rituximab in patients previously treated with at least 1 prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen and 
ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. 
Methods 
Study periods 
Screening  period:  up  to  28  days  before  randomization.  No  specific  anti-lymphoma  treatment  or  any  other 
experimental treatments were allowed. 
Treatment  period:  up  to  6  cycles  of  28  days,  during  which  disease  response  was  assessed  by  computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 8 weeks. Treatment was to be initiated as soon as 
possible and within 14 days after randomization. The treatment period continued until the end-of-treatment 
(EOT) visit, which was foreseen 4 to 7 weeks (inclusive) after the last dose of study drug administration (or 
scheduled administration), or before subsequent systemic anticancer therapy was given, whichever occurred 
first. 
Follow-up periods (without study treatment): 
• 
• 
Early  Follow-up:  after  treatment  discontinuation  for  reason  other  than  progressive  disease  or 
completion, patients were to enter the 24-week Early Follow-up Period, during which they were followed 
every 8 weeks for safety and progression. 
Intermediate Follow-up: after completing the 24-week Early Follow-up period, patients were to enter an 
additional 72-week Follow-up period, during which they were followed every 12 weeks for safety and 
progression. 
•  Survival Follow-up: patients entered the Survival Follow-up period when one of the following occurred: 
o  Completed Intermediate Follow-up. 
o  Developed progressive disease per Modified IWG criteria. 
o  Received a subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, except for rituximab given as maintenance 
therapy. 
o  Withdrew consent for study procedures.

comment 
The design of this study was similar compared to the study PIX 301; up to 6 cycles of 28 days of treatment were 
planned to be administrated. 
Bioanalytical method for quantitation of pixantrone in plasma 
Plasma  concentrations  of  pixantrone  were  determined  with  a  validated  (ATL-15-1486)  LC-MS/MS  method 
(BAM513). Pixantrone dimaleate was used as a reference standard and pixantrone-D8 diformate as an internal 
standard. Samples were processed by protein precipitation. Lithium Heparin was used as anticoagulant. Initially, 
the sample storage condition was -80°C with the option that samples could also be stored at -20°C, if necessary. 
Later the optional storage condition at -20°C was removed. Long term stability results of samples at -20°C or 
-80°C have not been presented, and it is stated that the overall sample storage period of 576 days is not covered 
by stability data. 
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a liquid chromatography system equipped with a C18 reversed 
phase  column.  Detection  was  achieved  by  tandem  mass  spectrometry  with  a  triple  quadrupole  mass 
spectrometer working in the electrospray ionisation positive mode. 
Eight  calibration  standards  with  a  concentration  ranging  from  5  ng/ml  to  1000  ng/ml  were  used.  The  back 
calculated concentrations of the calibration standards are presented. QC samples at thee concentration levels 
15.0 ng/ml (QC low), 250 ng/ml (QC med) and 800 ng/ml (QC high) were included. 
A total of 98 human plasma samples were collected and each sample was stored as 2 aliquots, corresponding to 
196 aliquots. Originally, 78 analyses were done on 70 aliquots using the first analytical method and surprisingly 
low  pixantrone  concentrations  were  obtained.  Investigation  was  started  to  identify  the  cause  for  the  low 
concentrations. After investigations, it was identified that the reference material used to prepare calibration 
standard and QC samples was not pixantrone as administered to clinical subject. A new method validation was 
performed (ATL-17-1841) with the adequate reference material. All the 98 samples were then analysed with this 
new method. 
comment 
There were fourteen patients in this PK sub-study. For each patient, 7 samples were collected and each sample 
was  stored  as  2  aliquots.  The  total  number  of  samples  was  98  corresponding  to  196  aliquots.  Originally, 
78 analyses  were  done  on  70  aliquots  using  the  first  method.  Due  to  surprisingly  low  concentrations  of 
pixantrone measured in these samples, an investigation was started. After investigation, it was identified that 
the there was a problem with the reference material. A new updated method was developed and validated and 
all the 98 samples were analysed with this second method. 
Validation reports ATL-15-1486 and ATL-17-1841 have been provided corresponding to the original and updated 
bioanalytical method, respectively.

comment 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study PIX306 seemed representative of a population of subjects with 
relapsed DLBCL. There were several differences in the inclusion and exclusion criteria when comparing studies 
306 and 301, as highlighted below. 
The most significant difference is number of prior therapies allowed: 1-3 prior regimens for DLBCL in study 
PIX306 vs. relapse after 2 or more prior regimens of chemotherapy in study PIX301. Other important difference 
was the requirement that all patients in study PIX306 should have received a rituximab-containing multi-agent 
regimen, while in study PIX 301 patients must have received rituximab in prior regimens in those countries 
where it was the standard of care and available at the patient’s institution. 
Importantly,  patients  with  prior  treatment  with  a  cumulative  dose  of  doxorubicin  or  equivalent  exceeding 
450 mg/m²  were  excluded  from  both  studies.  There  was  a  minor  difference  in  the  LVEF-criteria  by 
echocardiogram: in study 306 patients with LVEF < 45% were excluded, in study 301 LVEF had to be ≥ 50%.

Treatments 
Investigational treatments 
The investigational treatment in this trial is pixantrone in combination with rituximab. The regimen was given in 
up to six 28-day cycles, consisting of pixantrone 50 mg/m2 (in its base form) IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 
cycle and rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle. Refer to Table 5.2. 
The investigational treatment in this trial is gemcitabine in combination with rituximab. The regimen was given 
in up to six 28-day cycles, consisting of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle and 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle. 
 Table 3: Treatment administration (Study PIX306) 
The choice of pixantrone dose (50 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles) was based on preclinical testing 
and  clinical  evaluation  in  phase  1  to 3  studies.  The  phase  1  and  2  studies  (in  which  pixantrone  doses were 
expressed  in  terms  of  the  salt,  pixantrone  dimaleate)  administered  dose-dense  monotherapy  to  heavily 
pre-treated patients with lymphoid neoplasia or solid tumours. These studies defined a pixantrone dimaleate 
dose range of ≥ 56 mg/m2 (with which no grade 3 toxicity was observed) and ≤ 112.5 mg/m2 (with which 50% 
of patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia). Although some responses were noted at lower dose levels, in patients 
with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, 84 mg/m² pixantrone dimaleate (dose intensity 60.5 mg/m2/week) was 
the lowest dose at which durable CRs were seen. This dose choice (equivalent to the present dose of 50 mg/m2 
of pixantrone) was confirmed in the phase 2 study AZA II-01, in patients with relapsed aggressive NHL, and in 
the phase III study PIX-301. 
Combining pixantrone chemotherapy with the anti-CD20 agent rituximab was expected to produce synergistic 
effects  with  minimal  overlapping  toxicity  and  minimal  drug  interactions.  This  combination  was  compared  to 
rituximab  alone in  a  small  randomized  trial  of  38 patients  with  relapsed  follicular  NHL  (study  AZA302).  The 
combination was well tolerated and associated with a significantly higher response rate (75% versus 33% on 
monotherapy, p = 0.038) and time to progression than rituximab alone (395 days versus 245 days, HR = 0.14, 
p < 0.001). Long term responses (> 1 year) were only observed in patients treated with pixantrone. 
The choice of comparator was based on the NCCN guidelines published at that time, for patients with relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL who are not candidates for SCT, recommending entry to a clinical study, or single-agent, 
doublet,  or  multiagent  regimens,  some  containing  gemcitabine  and/or  rituximab.  The  ESMO  guidelines  also 
propose  a  gemcitabine-based  regimen  including  rituximab  as  salvage  treatment,  or  clinical  trials  with  novel

drugs,  in  patients  non-eligible  for  transplant.  Small  studies  have  shown  promising  results  in  patients  with 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL (Wenger et al., 2005; Corazzeli et al., 2009). The combination of gemcitabine and 
rituximab therefore appeared to be a reasonable therapeutic option in patients with relapsed NHL if ineligible for 
SCT. 
comment 
The dose of pixantrone (in combination with rituximab) was identical compared to the dose administered in the 
pivotal study PIX301 and to the dose recommended in the marketing authorisation. 
The dose of rituximab was identical compared to dose used the in combination with CHOP chemotherapy in first 
line treatment. Basically all patients receive rituximab in first line and in case of relapse many patients develop 
disease that is refractory to rituximab. Combining pixantrone chemotherapy with the anti-CD20 agent rituximab 
was expected to produce synergistic effects. However, the role of rituximab in salvage treatment (like here in 
combination with either pixantrone or gemcitabine) in second or further line treatment is not clear. 
The choice of the comparator, gemcitabine, seems to be acceptable at the time study PIX306 was initiated. At 
that time there were no approved second-line treatments in relapsed DLBCL and gemcitabine was shown to 
have at least some effect in the treatment of patients with relapsed DLBCL. 
There is still an unmet medical need for effective second-line therapies for relapsed DLBCL because even today 
there  are  no  approved  or  universally  used  second-line  regimens  especially  in  patients  with  comorbidities  or 
advanced age. 
Concomitant treatments 
Patients  could  receive  all  concomitant  therapy  deemed  necessary  to  provide  adequate  support  (only 
study-prescribed  investigational  agents),  including  antiemetics,  medications  to  prevent  or  treat  rituximab 
hypersensitivity and medications to prevent tumor lysis syndrome (allopurinol or rasburicase). Patients could 
not receive any other systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy while receiving treatment in this study. Low 
dose  corticosteroids  were  allowed  for  the  treatment  of  non-cancer-related  illness  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator. 
Colony-stimulating  factors  could  be  used  at  the  investigator’s  discretion  and  according  to  the  institutional 
guidelines,  but  were  discontinued  at  least  2  days  prior  to  the  next  scheduled  study  drug  administration.  If 
pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) was to be used, it was to be given only after the Day 15 dose of each cycle. 
Routine  prophylaxis  with  antiemetics  was  recommended  per  institutional  guidelines.  In  addition,  routine 
premedication and additional treatments to help prevent or treat hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis to rituximab 
were  recommended  (see  rituximab  package  insert),  or  per  institutional  guidelines.  Routine  prophylaxis  to 
prevent tumor lysis syndrome by administration with either allopurinol or rasburicase was also allowed, per the 
investigator’s clinical judgment. 
Patients who received pixantrone and were concomitantly taking medications that are CYP1A2 substrates, such 
as tricyclic antidepressants or theophylline, were to be closely monitored, as pixantrone has the potential to 
impair metabolism of these agents. 
Patients receiving pixantrone were encouraged to avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and use effective sun 
blocker agents. Topical sun blocking agents were not reported as concomitant medications. 
In vitro -studies with the most common human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (including CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) have shown a possible mixed-type inhibition of CYP1A2and CYP2C8 that may be of 
Assessment report

clinical relevance. No other significant clinically relevant interactions with CYPP450 isozymes were observed. 
Theophylline  is  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP1A2.  When  co-administering  the  narrow  therapeutic  index 
medicinal product theophylline with pixantrone, there is a theoretical concern that this substrate may increase 
in concentration, resulting in theophylline toxicity. Theophylline levels were carefully monitored in the weeks 
immediately following initiation of pixantrone concurrent therapy. Warfarin is partially metabolized by CYP1A2, 
and  a  theoretical  concern  exists  with  regard  to  co-administration  of  this  medicinal  product  and  the  effect 
inhibition of its metabolism might have on its intended action. Coagulation parameters, specifically international 
normalized ratio (INR), were monitored in the days immediately following the initiation of pixantrone concurrent 
therapy. Amitriptyline, haloperidol, clozapine, ondansetron and propranolol are metabolized by CYP1A2, and 
therefore a theoretical concern exists that co-administration of pixantrone may increase blood levels of this 
medicinal product. 
Based  on  in  vitro  studies,  pixantrone  was  found  to  be  a  substrate  for  the  membrane  transport  proteins 
P-gp/BRCP and OCT1. Agents that inhibit these transporters have the potential to decrease hepatic uptake and 
excretion efficiency of pixantrone. Blood counts were closely monitored when co-administered with agents that 
inhibit  such  transporters,  such  as  cyclosporine  A  or  tacrolimus,  commonly  used  to  control  chronic 
graft-versus-host disease, and the anti-HIV agents, ritonavir, saquinavir, or nelfinavir. In addition, caution was 
taken  when  pixantrone  was  continuously  co-administered  with  efflux  transport  inducers,  such  as  rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, and glucocorticoids, as pixantrone excretion maybe increased with a consequent decrease of 
systemic exposure. 
comment 
Follow-up of patients receiving concomitant treatments with interaction potential with the study drugs has been 
appropriate. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  is  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  pixantrone  +  rituximab  compared  with  gemcitabine  + 
rituximab  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  de  novo  DLBCL,  DLBCL  transformed  from  indolent  lymphoma,  or 
follicular grade 3 lymphoma who have relapsed after at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and who are not 
currently eligible for high-dose (myeloablative)chemotherapy and SCT. 
The objective of the PK substudy was to compare the PK of pixantrone in patients who receive rituximab therapy 
versus patients who do not receive routine rituximab therapy. 
Primary objective 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  (as  measured  by  progression-free  survival 
[PFS])  of  pixantrone  +  rituximab  (pixantrone  +  rituximab)  compared  with  gemcitabine  +  rituximab 
(gemcitabine + rituximab) in patients with a diagnosis of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), DLBCL 
transformed from indolent lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FL grade 3) who had relapsed after at 
least  1  prior  chemotherapy  regimen  and  who  were  currently  ineligible  for  high-dose  (myeloablative) 
chemotherapy and stem cell transplant (SCT). 
• 
• 
Patients with de novo DLBCL must have received 1-3 prior regimens for DLBCL. 
Patients with FL grade 3 must have received 1-3 prior regimens for follicular lymphoma (any grade). 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 29/107 
  
  
 
• 
Patients with DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma must have received 1-4 prior regimens for 
NHL (any type). 
Patients must have received at least one rituximab-containing multi-agent regimen and should have had no 
progression for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of a treatment regimen. Patients ineligible for SCT included 
those who relapsed after previous SCT; did not respond to a standard salvage regimen; did not mobilize an 
adequate number of stem cells for SCT; were unsuitable for SCT due to other medical conditions or age; did not 
wish to undergo SCT; had financial issues precluding SCT; were considered by the investigator as unsuitable for 
SCT for any other reason. 
Secondary Objectives 
To compare the two treatment arms with regards to the following secondary endpoints: 
•  Overall survival (OS). 
•  Overall response rate (ORR). 
•  Complete response (CR) rate. 
•  Safety  
Exploratory Objectives 
•  Assess the duration of overall response between treatments. 
•  Assess the duration of complete response (CR) between treatments. 
•  Determine the proportion of randomized patients who received a SCT after study treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics sub-study objective 
• 
To characterize the PK profile of pixantrone when co-administered with rituximab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Disease assessment included neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis via CT scan with IV contrast, if possible, or else 
MRI  of  the  neck,  abdomen  and  pelvis  with  non-contrast  chest  CT  scan.  The  imaging  method  used  for  each 
participant at baseline was used throughout the study. Disease assessment was carried out at baseline and 
every 8 weeks ± 1 week from Day 1 of Cycle 1 (see Table 5.3) 1) during the treatment and early follow-up 
periods and then every 12 weeks ± 2 weeks during intermediate follow-up period. 
PET was not required, even at baseline, except at the end of study visit (EOT, 4 to 7 weeks following the last 
study  drug  dose  administration)  unless  geographically  unavailable  or  the  patient  had  PD  per  Modified  IWG 
criteria,  or  the  patient  had  received  subsequent  systemic  anticancer  therapy,  except  for  rituximab  given  as 
maintenance therapy. PET scans obtained alone or in combination with CT scan (PET/CT) were acquired from the 
skull base to the upper thighs following standard imaging protocols. A bone marrow biopsy (with core) was also 
required at EOT to confirm a CR, unless a bone marrow biopsy was obtained at baseline and was negative. 
At each evaluation time point, every target and non-target lesion were evaluated. Once a patient was assessed 
by the investigator as having PD as defined by the modified IWG 2007 Revised Response Criteria no further CT 
or PET scans or disease response assessments were required by the study.

The study committees were involved in the confirmation of diagnosis (CPRC), the assessment of radiological 
images (IRC) and in the evaluation of treatment toxicity and appropriateness of treatment doses (IDMC). The 
interim OS analysis for this report was performed by the IDMC. 
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints include overall surviva (OS), 
overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), and safety. 
PFS as assessed by the IRC. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of PD or 
death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). 
The outcome of the PK substudy is the time-concentration data of pixantrone, measured before the start of 
pixantrone  infusion  and  approximately  at  1h,  1.5h,  2h,  4h,  6h,  and  24  to  48h  after  the  start  of  pixantrone 
infusion. 
comment 
The optimal primary efficacy endpoint in this kind of study population would have been OS. 
In  the  original  protocol,  the  primary  study  endpoint  was  PFS,  but  this  was  changed  before  the  start  of 
recruitment (Amendment No. 2) to combined primary of PFS and OS (with a resulting modification of the size of 
the patient population). Amendment 4 changed the primary endpoint to OS only (as requested by the FDA) with 
PFS  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  Amendment  8  changed  the  primary  endpoint  back  to  PFS  (due  to  enrolment 
difficulties). 
Regardless  of  the  above  mentioned  slightly  confusing  changes  to  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  PFS  is  an 
acceptable primary efficacy endpoint with OS as a key secondary endpoint. PFS has been previously approved 
as a measure of the clinical efficacy of therapy in comparable oncological and haematological settings. 
The timetable and monitoring of the treatment efficacy with the disease assessments by CT, PET (at the end of 
study visit) and bone marrow biopsy (at the end of study visit, unless negative at baseline) are acceptable and 
follow the current guidelines for evaluating treatment response in DLBCL. 
One hundred ninety-five (195) PFS events confirmed by an independent review are required for the analysis of 
the primary endpoint to detect at least a 35% improvement (i.e., HR = 0.65) in PFS with 85% power and a 
2-sided alpha of 0.05. Based on results from the study by Pettengell et al., it was assumed that the median PFS 
for the control group is 2.8 months. It was estimated that approximately 320 patients were needed to reach the 
required 195 PFS events  within approximately 80 months after randomization of the  first patient. However, 
further to an increase of the enrolment rate in the last 2 months, the recruitment was stopped in August 2017 
with 312 randomized patients. 
For  the  secondary  endpoint  of  OS,  220  deaths  are  planned  to  have  75%  power  to  detect  at  least  a  30% 
improvement in OS allowing for 5% drop-offs, or 68% power to detect at least a 28% improvement in OS. Based 
on  results  from  the  study  by  Pettengell  et  al.,  it  was  assumed  that  the  median  OS  for  the  control  group  is 
7 months. 
For the PK substudy, the objective was to enrol approximately 20 patients. 
comment 
Final sample size calculations, planning to show superiority in the pixantrone + rituximab treatment-arm, were 
acceptable for both PFS and OS.

Randomisation 
Approximately  320  patients  are  planned  to  be  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  one  of  the  two  treatment  arms 
stratified by number of prior therapies (0 to 2 vs. ≥ 3), IPI score (0 to 2, ≥ 3), and length of time from initiation 
of first-line therapy until first relapse (< 1 year vs ≥ 1 year). 
comment 
Selected randomization procedure with the proposed stratifications was appropriate. 
Blinding (masking) 
Treatment  assignment  was  known  by  investigators,  site  personnel  and  patients,  but  the  sponsor  (with  the 
exception of certain CTI personnel responsible for pharmacovigilance activities, regulatory submissions and GCP 
Compliance) remained blinded during the study until the core database lock. 
At the time of the core database lock, the sponsor was unblinded to all data except the OS datasets. Indeed, the 
OS interim results were produced by the IDMC and the sponsor had only access to those unblinded OS interim 
results  (no  patient  data).  At  that  time,  all  patients  had  completed  their  treatment.  However,  the  deaths 
contributing to the PFS events in the core locked database were part of the unblinded data. The sponsor remains 
blinded to OS datasets until the final OS analysis. 
This study was conducted using sponsor’s blinding procedures. The official clinical database stayed blinded for 
the primary endpoint analysis until data review had been completed, protocol violations identified, data declared 
clean, and a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was written and approved. 
Members of the IRC, who were to determine the disease response for all randomized patients, remained blinded 
to site identifiers, patient treatment arm and investigator’s target lesions. 
comment 
The sponsor was blinded during the study until the core database lock which is appropriate in this type of study. 
Statistical methods 
The  statistical  plans  were  changed  frequently;  the  changes  were  documents  as  protocol  amendments.  It  is 
assumed that the sponsor remained blinded throughout the process. The primary endpoint was initially PFS, was 
changed PFS and OS as co-primary, OS as primary, and finally back to initial plan with PFS as primary. 
Through  all  the  changes  the  primary  aim  was  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  pixantrone  +  rituximab  over 
gemcitabine + rituximab in terms of efficacy measured with tumour response and/or overall survival. 
Analysis populations 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population (i.e., Full Analysis Set) is defined as all randomized patients regardless of 
whether subjects received any study treatment, or received a different treatment from the treatment they were 
randomized to. Following the ITT principle, patients were analysed according to the treatment to which they 
were assigned at randomization. 
This set is the primary population used for all efficacy analyses. 
In addition histologically confirmed, per-protocol and safety populations were defined. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 34/107 
  
  
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the 
date of PD or death of any cause), whichever occurred first, for patients in the ITT population. The primary 
analysis of PFS was based on disease progression as determined by the IRC. Censoring rules are presented 
below. 
 Table 6: Event and censoring rules for PFS primary analysis (Study PIX306) 
For the primary efficacy analysis, PFS between the two treatment arms was compared in the ITT population 
using a stratified log-rank test, on the randomization stratification factors as reported in the eCRF. Summary 
statistics, including median PFS time and the corresponding 95% confidence interval based on KM estimates, 
were presented by treatment group. The KM curves by treatment group were plotted. 
A Cox regression model with a term for treatment arm, adjusted for the randomization stratification factors 
(actual  strata),  was  used  to  quantify  the  treatment  difference  in  PFS.  HRs  and  corresponding  95%  CIs  as 
estimated from the Cox regression model are also presented. 
To assess the robustness of the primary PFS results, exploratory sensitivity analyses using different rules for 
censoring/defining the PD event, or relating to the stratification factor variable, or using different sets of patients 
were performed. 
Secondary endpoints 
Overall Survival (OS) 
OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient 
was alive or the survival status was unknown by the data cut-off date for analysis, survival was censored at the 
date that patient was last known to be alive. This primary OS analysis was performed in the ITT population using 
stratified log-rank test and adjusted Cox-regression model, stratified by the actual strata values as documented 
in the eCRF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 35/107 
  
  
 
Overall response rate (ORR) 
The  ORR  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  a  CR  or  PR  without  additional  anticancer 
therapy.  Patients  who  discontinued  before  any  response  was  observed,  or  received  additional  anticancer 
therapy before a response was observed were considered non-responders. 
The primary analysis of ORR was based on the IRC response assessments in the ITT population. Comparison of 
the  ORRs  between  the  2  treatment  arms  was  performed  using  the  exact  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test, 
controlling for the stratification factors used for randomization with actual strata values as documented in the 
eCRF (if a mis-stratification occurred). 
Complete Response (CR) Rate 
CR rate was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a CR without additional therapy. Patients who 
discontinued  before  any  response  has  been  observed  or  received  additional  anticancer  therapy  before  a 
response has been observed were considered non-responders. CR was analysed in the same manner as for ORR. 
Multiplicity 
For the efficacy analysis, treatment arms were compared all primary and secondary endpoints. The multiplicity 
arising from the testing of multiple endpoints was addressed using a closed hierarchical testing procedure that 
required  establishing  significance  in  the  primary  endpoint  prior  to  assessing  the  significance  of  secondary 
endpoints to ensure the overall type I error at 0.05. 
The order of secondary endpoints in the hierarchical testing was: OS, ORR, CR. 
The multiplicity of OS analyses was to be addressed using group sequential methods. 
Study analyses 
The study analyses are planned as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The core analysis will be performed after 195 PFS events have occurred to evaluate the primary and 
secondary objectives of the study, with the exception of OS. Projections suggest that 195 PFS events will 
be observed by February 2018. 
The first interim analysis (IA) of OS will be performed after approximately 165 OS events (75%) have 
occurred and confirmation of 195 PFS events and it is projected to be observed by January 2018. 
The second IA of OS will be performed when 190 OS events (86%) have occurred and it is projected to 
be observed by January 2019. 
The final analysis will be performed at the end of the study, when the 220 OS events have occurred and 
it is projected to be observed by January 2022. 
PK analyses were performed using data from all randomized patients who received any dose of study treatment 
and provided at least one appropriate sample for plasma PK analysis. The PK analysis consisted of creating a 
Visual Predictive Check (VPC) for the new patients, based on a previously developed population PK model. No 
new  PK modelling was conducted; the goal was to  compare the predictions from the existing population PK 
model to the new data (external validation).

comment 
The statistical analyses followed the standards in this type of trial for definition of analysis population, endpoints, 
censoring  rules,  multiplicity,  and  analysis  methods  including  sensitivity  analysis.  The  main  issue  with  the 
analysis  plans  was  the  frequent  change  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  a  trial  where  MAH’s  blinding  cannot  be 
ensured; however the primary endpoint has been PFS or OS or both, which both are well-accepted endpoints in 
this indication, and the MAH have ensured that the blinding was retained. Furthermore as the trial outcome was 
negative, this is not an issue with regards to the type I error rate. 
The MAH decided to conduct a visual inspection of whether the PK of pixantrone is different in patients receiving 
rituximab, versus the patient population that was studied earlier. This approach is rational. Nevertheless, the 
MAH  was  asked  to  present  additional  evidence  to  show  that  there  are  no  trends  in  the  PK  of  pixantrone  in 
rituximab-treated patients, when compared to the rest of the patient population. Two RSI’s were requested. 
First, the MAH was asked to demonstrate via descriptive statistics and t-test that the CWRES residuals of the PK 
samples of the current study are not significantly different from zero. The aim of this request was to verify that 
the overall pixantrone concentrations are not significantly different in the currently studied patient population, 
when compared to the patient population studied earlier. Second, the MAH was requested to incorporate the 
newly generated data into the existing population pharmacokinetic dataset, and to test rituximab co-treatment 
separately as a covariate of pixantrone clearance and volume of distribution. The aim of this request was to 
specifically  verify  that  pixantrone  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  are  not  significantly  different  in  the 
currently studied patient population, when compared to the patient population studied earlier. 
The MAH was able to convincingly demonstrate that the PK of pixantrone in patients receiving rituximab is not 
significantly different from the PK of pixantrone in patients not receiving rituximab, in these data. For details, 
please see Section 10.2 Q7-Q8. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 312 patients were randomized in this study: 155 patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group and 157 
in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. The disposition of patients and their follow-up is presented below

Disposition of randomised patients by group (Study PIX306) 
A total of 133 patients (42.6%) completed the treatment: 72 patients (46.5%) in the pixantrone + rituximab 
group and 61 patients (38.9%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group.

Patients were withdrawn from treatment mostly because of progressive disease: 47 patients (30.3%) in the 
pixantrone + rituximab group versus 50 patients (31.8%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group, or AE (13.5% 
versus 9.6%, respectively). There was a slight imbalance in the proportion of patients who withdrew consent for 
treatment (3.9% versus 10.2%); no information is available on follow-on therapies. 
As of the data cut-off date (31 May 2018), a total of 197 patients (63.1%) were withdrawn from the study (103 
[66.5%] patients in the pixantrone + rituximab arm and 94 [59.9%] patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab 
arm).  Main  reasons  for  withdrawal  from  the  study  were  death  (178  patients  overall,  57.1%)  and  consent 
withdrawal (14 patients overall, 4.5%).

comment 
Based on subject selection, the study results (PIX306) can be generalised to the European DLBCL patients. This 
is important, because in the pivotal study PIX301, only 38/140 patients were recruited in “Western Europe”. This 
could possibly explain the lower than expected use of rituximab (already approved 3/2002 in EU) in the first line 
treatment of patients recruited into the study PIX301. 
Overall only 42.6% of patients completed the planned treatment in study PIX306, with consent withdrawal being 
the reason for higher number of discontinuation in the gemcitabine + rituximab group (10.2 vs. 3.7). In total 
61.1% in the gemcitabine + rituximab group vs. 53.5% in the pixantrone + rituximab discontinued treatment.

The  number  of  patients  withdrawn  from  treatment  because  of  progressive  disease,  the  main  reason,  was 
comparable:  47  patients  (30.3%)  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  versus  50  patients  (31.8%)  in  the 
gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments: 
Nine protocol amendments were issued for this study. The significant changes consisted of: 
Amendment No. 1, dated 9 December 2010 concerned the clarification of PFS definition and the modification of 
censoring  rules.  For  patients  “who  received  any  new  lymphoma-directed  therapy  (other  than  rituximab  as 
maintenance)  before  progression  of  disease”,  the  date  of  censoring  was  defined  as  the  date  of  the  “last 
radiologic  assessment  prior  to  the  start  of  the  new  therapy”,  instead  of  the  “date  of  first  administration  of 
additional treatment”. 
Amendment No. 2, dated 10 March 2011, concerned mainly: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The change in the study primary objective: OS, initially a secondary objective, was added to PFS as a 
combined  primary  objective.  Statistical  methods  including  sample  size  determination  were  updated 
taking into account this modification. 
The increase in the number of patients to be randomized (from 300 to 350). 
The replacement of the stratification factor “prior SCT” by “length of time from initiation of first-line 
therapy for aggressive NHL until first relapse”. 
The addition of safety criteria (study-related AEs and some cardiac events and assessments) during the 
Follow-up periods. 
•  As regards to the reporting of AEs, it was also specified that cardiac AEs ≥ grade 3 were to be collected 
until the end of the study and followed until resolution or no further improvement was expected. 
•  Specifications on clinical examination were added. 
• 
The  modification  of  inclusion  criteria  (bone  core  biopsy  was  to  be  obtained  within  8  weeks  prior  to 
randomization, addition of the necessity to confirm the response to CHOP-R by a second radiographic 
assessment;  removal  of  the  24-week  delay  between  day  1  of  last  cycle  of  CHOP-R  or  equivalent 
treatment and subsequent relapse, and update of the laboratory requirements for platelets and absolute 
neutrophil count). 
• 
The addition of primary refractory aggressive NHL as an exclusion criterion. 
•  An update of pixantrone and gemcitabine dose adjustments and delays for hematologic toxicity. 
Amendment No. 3, dated 3 August 2011, included: 
•  An update of Safety information in the background section. 
• 
• 
The clarification of the use of the terms “NHL” and “DLBCL”. 
The  modification  of  inclusion  criteria:  bone  marrow  biopsy  criteria  were  clarified,  prior  CHOP-R  was 
allowed for any type of NHL, patients with transformed follicular lymphoma who may not have received 
CHOP-R  as  first-line  therapy  for  aggressive  NHL  could  also  be  included  in  the  study,  definition  of 
Assessment report

measurable  disease  was  adjusted  to  be  consistent  with  other  Sections  in  the  protocol,  and  it  was 
specified that DLBCL diagnosis was to be confirmed by pathologic review. 
• 
The modification of exclusion criteria: definitions of measurable disease and primary refractory disease 
were updated and clarified, CNS involvement was further detailed, and enrolment of patients who had 
had certain low-risk cancers commonly found in this population was finally allowed. 
•  Disease Assessment Criteria were extensively clarified. 
• 
• 
• 
PET scan requirements were modified. 
The prior requirement for central evaluation of echocardiograms was removed, since implementing the 
central read processes negatively impacted timely site initiation and accrual of patients. There was no 
clear  need  for  a  retrospective  central  read,  but  there  was  considerable  negative  impact;  therefore, 
central read was deleted. Local echo evaluations were used for safety and treatment decisions. 
Procedures for dose adjustments and delays were detailed. 
Amendment No. 4, dated 5 January 2012, aimed to: 
•  Change the primary endpoint of the study to “overall survival” only, following FDA recommendations. 
PFS was therefore a secondary objective. All the protocol (primary and secondary endpoints, statistical 
analyses, etc) was modified accordingly. 
•  An interim analysis of OS, to be done when 150 deaths (50%) had occurred, was planned. The final OS 
analysis was to be performed when 300 deaths had occurred. 
•  Stratification factors were adjusted. 
•  Criteria for eligible patients were modified and clarified to ensure safety and enrolment of the target 
population. 
Amendment No. 5, dated 9 April 2012 for North America (NA), concerned: 
• 
• 
For  the  primary  objective,  eligibility  of  patients  was  further  detailed:  patients  were  to  “have  no 
progression for at least 12 weeks after last dose of a treatment regimen” instead of “were to have had 
a response to prior therapy”. 
In  response  to  a  recommendation  from  the  EMA,  pixantrone  dose  was  expressed  in  its  base  form 
(instead of its salt form) in the whole document. 
Amendment No. 5 NNA, dated 18 June 2012 for Non-North America (NNA), included: 
• 
• 
The rationale for rituximab-pixantrone combination was further detailed (NA + NNA). 
It  was  specified  that  the  study  would  be  conducted  in  NA,  Western  Europe  and  potentially  Eastern 
Europe (NNA). 
Amendment No. 6 NNA, dated 17 October 2012 for NNA, concerned mainly: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In response to EMA, the pixantrone dose was expressed in its base form (instead of its salt 
form) in the whole document. 
It was specified that the study would be conducted in NA, Eastern and Western Europe. 
Procedures for reporting AEs updated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 41/107 
  
  
Amendment No. 7 NNA, dated 16 September 2013, was applicable in NNA, and aimed to: 
Change in EOT window: The EOT visit was to occur at 4 to 7 weeks after last study drug dose, inclusive, or before 
non-protocol NHL therapy was given, whichever occurred first instead of “the EOT visit occurs at 5 weeks ± 
1 week after the last study drug administration or before non-protocol NHL therapy is given”. 
Gemcitabine dose modifications for hematologic toxicity were completed. 
Gemcitabine and pixantrone dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicity were completed. 
Amendment No. 8, dated 25 July 2014 for NA and NNA, unified the previous NA and NAA versions. Changes 
included those from Amendment No. 6 NA and Amendment No. 7 NNA. Major changes (Amendment No. 8 NA) 
were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The primary endpoint (previously OS) was replaced by PFS, as it reflects the effect of therapy on tumour 
growth and can be assessed as a surrogate for OS. Unlike the survival endpoint, PFS is not confounded 
by subsequent systemic anticancer therapy and has been used as a measure of the clinical efficacy of 
therapy  in  similar  settings.  OS  was  a  secondary  endpoint,  as  a  standard  endpoint  used  to  measure 
clinical  benefit.  All  the  protocol  (primary  and  secondary  endpoints,  statistical  analyses  […])  was 
modified accordingly. 
The number of subjects to be randomized was decreased from 350 to 260 patients. It was specified that 
enrolment  was  to  be  continued  until  195  PFS  events  occurred,  or  approximately  260  patients  were 
enrolled, whichever occurred first. Enrolment period was planned approximately 60 months from study 
initiation. 
It was specified that no interim analysis of PFS was planned. 
Exploratory objectives (assessment of duration of overall response between treatments, assessment of 
duration of CR between treatments, proportion of patients who received a SCT after study treatment) 
were added. 
•  Rituximab given as maintenance therapy was not allowed prior to the EOT visit per protocol window. 
•  A PK study was added 
Amendment No. 9, dated 10 July 2017, aimed to: 
•  Update the total number of patients to be enrolled, after simulation performed by the sponsor, from 260 
to 320 patients, to reach the 195 PFS events (per IRC) within a reasonable timeline to meet the study 
report due date. 
• 
Increase  enrolment  period  from  60  to  80  months,  to  accommodate  the  increase  in  the  number  of 
planned patients’ enrolment. 
•  Add one additional interim analysis for secondary efficacy endpoint OS, i.e. when 190 OS events (86% 
of the required number of OS events) have occurred, due to much slower occurrence of OS events than 
expected. Indeed, based on the updated projection, the time to achieve 220 OS events is year 2022, 
more than 3 years from the first interim analysis. Adding the 2nd OS interim analysis would provide a 
chance to stop the trial earlier if the treatment demonstrated superior survival benefit. 
• 
The hierarchy order for testing the secondary efficacy endpoints was updated. In view of the importance 
of OS in these patients and in order to better match the study objectives, there was reorganization of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 42/107 
  
  
order  of  endpoints  testing,  to  put  OS  ahead  of  overall  response  and  CR,  in  the  hypothesis  testing 
hierarchy of secondary endpoints. 
•  Clarify treatment blinding. 
•  Add a sub-group analysis. As the current indication is in 3rd and 4th line, a subgroup analysis defined by 
0-1 line versus more than 2 lines was added to confirm the efficacy and safety of pixantrone in the 
current indication and to evaluate them in 2nd line. 
comment 
The primary efficacy endpoint was changed several times in the above described amendments. 
Briefly, in the original protocol, the primary study endpoint was PFS, but this was changed before the start of 
recruitment (Amendment No. 2) to combined primary of PFS and OS (with a resulting modification of the size of 
the patient population). Amendment 4 changed the primary endpoint to OS only (as requested by the FDA) with 
PFS as a secondary endpoint. In agreement with the EMA, Amendment 8 changed the primary endpoint back to 
PFS (due to enrolment difficulties). This change of primary efficacy endpoint could be agreed on. 
The other above listed amendments are all well justifiable. 
Protocol deviations: 
Overall, 115 patients (36.9%) had at least one protocol deviation: 56 patients (36.1%) in the pixantrone + 
rituximab group and 59 patients (37.6%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. The most frequent deviations 
in both groups were related to study drug administration (20.0% of patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
versus  24.8%  in  the  gemcitabine  +  rituximab  group)  and  protocol  non-adherence  (11.0%  versus  13.4%, 
respectively). 
The deviations were thoroughly documented and reported. The major deviations included: 
•  Single cases of less than 28 days from previous NHL treatment prior to study dose. 
•  Single errors in doses based on incorrect BSA calculations or otherwise not following the protocol. 
•  Single errors in dose modifications to be performed according to blood counts 
•  Some cases of missing CT-scans or out of time window CT-scans. 
•  Some missing bone marrow biopsies at EOS visit (also after CR). 
Assessor’s comment 
Overall, the total number of protocol deviations was high. As a response to the questions regarding the protocol 
violations, the MAH has submitted a summary table of subjects with major protocol deviations from the ITT 
population.  The  majority  of  major  deviations  were  related  to  study  drug  administration  and  protocol 
non-adherence.  The  numbers  of  these  major  deviations  are  equally  distributed  between  the  two  treatment 
arms. 
Importantly, none of the protocol deviations led to patient withdrawal from the study. 
For intentional dose reductions refer to section “Safety - Safety exposure”, below.

Baseline data 
At baseline, the median age was 73.0 years ranging from 26 to 91 years. Most patients were 65 years old or 
older (78.8% overall). Just over half of the patients were women (56.4%) and the large majority (96.8%) were 
white. Two thirds of patients (66.7%) were enrolled in Europe and one third (33.3%) in North America.   
 Table 10: Main baseline characteristics in the ITT population (Study PIX306) 
The most common histological subtype assessed by local investigators was DLBCL (77.6% of patients), 13.8% 
of patients had DLBCL transformed from indolent, and 8.7% had FL Grade 3 lymphoma. According to CPRC, 
78.5% of patients had DLBCL, 4.8% had DLBCL with follicular components and 2.6% had FL Grade 3. Other 
patients were not diagnosed for lymphoma (4.8%), had other lymphoma (3.8%), were not assessed (3.5%) or 
assessment was missing (1.9%). The initial diagnosis was made at a median of 1.9 years (i.e., 22.8 months; 
ranging from 0 to 15 years) prior to study entry. 
Most patients had received 1 prior therapy (61.9%) for DLBCL or FL Grade 3 lymphoma; 21.8% had received 2 
prior therapies and 11.5% received 3 prior therapies. Most patients (53.2%) had a baseline IPI score ≥ 3. Time 
from initiation of first-line therapy for DLBCL or FL grade 3 until first relapse was a median of 1.4 years (i.e. 16.8 
months). Main reason for non-eligibility for HDC and SCT was “patient is not adequately fit” (39.4%).

Baseline disease characteristics - ITT population (Study PIX306) continued 
While every patient should have had at least 1 line of prior treatment, the patients with FL Grade 3 or DLBCL 
transformed from indolent lymphoma could have 0 prior lines of treatment for DLBCL or FL Grade 3 (which was 
a stratification criterion). For example, an FL Grade 3 patient could have had one prior line of treatment for FL 
Grade 2 and thus meet the inclusion criteria (while his number of prior lines for FL Grade 3 would be 0).

comment  
There were no discernible differences between the populations in the two treatment arms in the study PIX306 
concerning  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  as  well  as  baseline  disease  characteristics.  The  overall 
population with median age of 73 years represents typical DLBCL patients. 
The baseline performance status (ECOG) was also comparable between the two treatment groups. 
Overall, more than half of the patients (54.8%) received one prior systemic therapy, 24.7% received 2 prior 
systemic therapies and 17.6% received 3 prior systemic therapies. For the majority of patients (87.2%) the 
most  recent  systemic  therapies  for  NHL  prior  to  inclusion  in  the  study  pursued  a  curative  intent.  The  best 
response to the most recent systemic therapy was CR or CRu in 55.4% of patients and PR in 30.1%.

comment 
The main difference between studies PIX301 and PIX306 was the number of previous chemotherapy regimens. 
Most of patients have had only 1 previous therapy is study PIX306 (54.8%) while all patients had had at least 
two and 55% of patients’ 3-5 prior regimens in study PIX301. 
The listing of previous therapies and especially the use of previous cardiotoxic treatments was comprehensively 
presented (in Tables 5.12-5.14) from study PIX 301. Importantly, similar detailed presentation of prior NHL 
therapies  in  patients  with  DLBCL  from  study  PIX306  and  especially  category  of  prior  chemotherapies  was 
missing. The MAH has updated the information with the data regarding the missing information of the previous 
potentially cardiotoxic treatments (anthracyclines) and other DLBCL therapies. Almost all patients have received 
previous  treatment  with  anthracyclines;  148  (95.5%)  in  the  pixantrone  +  R-arm  and  143  (91.1%)  in  the 
gemcitabine+R-arm.  In  addition,  regarding  all  other  previous  treatments,  the  use  of  different  prior  DLBCL 
therapies are equally balanced between the two treatment arms. 
Most patients presented with a cardiac history at baseline: 63.9% in the pixantrone + rituximab group  and 
66.2% in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. There was on-going baseline history of coronary artery disease 
(CAD) in 10.3% of patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group and 17.2% in the gemcitabine + rituximab 
group;  all  cases  were  currently  stable.    A  history  of  myocardial  infarction  was  reported  by  2.6%  of  the 
pixantrone + rituximab group compared to 5.1% of the gemcitabine + rituximab; all were resolved. CHF was 
reported in 5.2% versus 5.7%, respectively. Among them, 2 (both in the pixantrone group) were resolved at 
baseline  and  15  were  on-going  and  currently  stable  (6  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  and  9  in  the 
gemcitabine + rituximab group).

The provided history of cardiac co-morbidity is comparable between the two treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
The ITT population consisted of all 312 patients randomized, refer to Table 5.16. A total of 44 patients were 
excluded from the HITT after the histological diagnosis by the Central Pathology Review Committee (27 patients 
in the pixantrone + rituximab group and 17 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group). Thus, in these 
patients, de novo DLBCL, DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma, or FL grade 3 could not be confirmed. 
A total of 28 patients were excluded from the PP for major protocol violations (10 patients in the pixantrone + 
rituximab group and 18 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group).  
The  Safety  Population  consisted  of  302  patients  (153  patients  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  and 
149 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group) who were randomized and received at least one dose of the 
study drug. Ten patients were excluded (2 in the pixantrone + rituximab group and 8 in the gemcitabine + 
rituximab group) for not having taken any study drug.

comment 
Surprisingly high number of patients were excluded from the HITT population. This highlights the importance of 
reliable pathological diagnosis of an aggressive disease like DLBCL. There is a slight imbalance between the 
treatment  groups  regarding  this  HITT  population;  128  patients  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  vs. 
140 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
28  patients  (almost  10%  of  the  total  patient  population)  were  excluded  from  the  PP  population  for  major 
protocol violations. The MAH has provided in detail information of the patient population excluded from the PP 
population. The most important reasons for these exclusions were related to baseline tumor assessment/ tumor 
response  assessment  after  randomization.  All  patients  were  adequately  excluded  from  the  PP  population 
following the exclusion rules of the SAP.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy criterion 
Progression free survival 
PFS per IRC assessment is presented in Table 5.17 and Figure 5.2 in the ITT Population. The median PFS was 
7.3 months  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  versus  6.3  months  in  the  gemcitabine  +  rituximab  group. 
Compared  with  the  gemcitabine  +  rituximab  group,  the  adjusted  HR  (95%  CI)  of  PFS  in  the  pixantrone  + 
rituximab  group  was  0.85  (95%  CI  [0.64,  1.14]).  No  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two 
treatment groups was demonstrated in terms of PFS (p = 0.2782 on log-rank test). All sensitivity analyses were 
consistent with the primary analysis – there was no significant statistical difference between the two groups.

Analysis in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy for DLBCL or FL Grade 3 
Main  demographic  characteristics  of  this  subgroup  were  consistent  with  the  overall  study  population.  Their 
median age was 69.0 years, 51.0% were female, 82.7% of patients had DLBCL, with an initial diagnosis was 
made at median of 2.6 years (i.e., 22.8 months). 
PFS per IRC assessment is presented in Table 5.18 in the subgroup of patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. 
The median of PFS in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy was 3.9 months [2.5, 7.4] in the pixantrone + 
rituximab group versus 4.4 months [3.2, 7.8] in the gemcitabine + rituximab group, HR = 1.03 [0.64, 1.65].

comment 
The  primary  endpoint  IRC-assessed  PFS  was  not  fulfilled;  median  PFS  was  7.3  months  in  the  pixantrone  + 
rituximab group versus 6.3 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab group, p=0.2782 and HR 0.85 (0.64, 1.14). 
Thus the superiority claim of pixantrone + rituximab was not met and with this regard this study failed to show 
PFS benefit over the comparator arm. 
In  addition,  all  sensitivity  analyses  were  in  line  with  the  primary  analysis  with  no  significant  statistical 
differences  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  The  results  from  the  subgroup  analysis  of  PFS  per  IRC 
assessment produced mixed results with hazard ratios favouring the pixantrone + R arm on the other hand and 
the comparator arm on the other. However, there were no clear differences in any subgroup analysis. 
The median of PFS in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy (like in the population in the pivotal study PIX301) 
was 3.9 months in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 4.4 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
In comparison, in study PIX301 the median PFS in the pixantrone alone group was 5.0 months. 
Secondary efficacy criteria 
Overall survival 
The following analysis of OS is the first interim analysis planned by the protocol, which was carried out at the 
time of the core database lock. At the time of the first interim analysis, 177 deaths had occurred: 94 (60.6%) in 
the pixantrone + rituximab group and 83 (52.9%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
The median (95% CI) OS was 13.3 (10.1, 19.8) months in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 19.6 (12.4, 
31.9)  months  in  the  gemcitabine  +  rituximab  group.  The  adjusted  HR  (95%  CI)  of  OS  in  the  pixantrone  + 
rituximab group compared to the gemcitabine + rituximab group was 1.13 (0.83, 1.53).

comment 
Result from the first interim analysis showed a median OS of 13.3 months in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
versus 19.6 months in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. This difference was not statistically significant with 
HR  of  1.13  (95%  CI:  0.655-1.260),  unstratified  log-rank  test  p=  0.4326).  The  results  from  the  subgroup 
analysis  of  OS  were  consistent  across  most  of  the  subgroups  and  with  the  results  of  the  overall  population 
analysis. 
Basically, when PFS is chosen as the primary endpoint, a clear positive trend in OS is considered essential. 
However, currently this is not the case. In this study both the primary efficacy endpoint PFS and key secondary 
endpoint OS, both failed to show superiority of the pixantrone + rituximab over gemcitabine + rituximab. In this 
respect, this is a failed study. 
The median of OS in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy (like in the population in the pivotal study PIX301) 
was  10.1  months  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  versus  10.5  months  in  the  gemcitabine  +  rituximab 
group. This OS result, while taking into account of the indirect nature of the comparison, is in line with  the 
median OS in the pixantrone alone group of 10.2 months in the study PIX301. 
According to the MAH, following the analysis of the primary endpoint of this study, it was decided by the sponsor 
not to continue the study until the target 220 events for the OS analysis, but terminate it within 6 months of the 
data cut-off date (the actual date was 14 September 2018). The final OS analysis was done using the final 
cut-off date of September, 14 2018. Six (6) additional OS events (3 in each arm) are included in this final OS 
analysis; 183 deaths had occurred. 
The OS trending in the wrong direction (HR 1.13) was initially a matter of concern. However, while the OS HR 
point  estimate  was  on  the  wrong  side  of  unity  (HR  1.13),  the  confidence  intervals  are  very  wide.  While 
information on post progression therapies is not available, there were no new safety concerns identified which 
would support a true detrimental effect on OS.  
The  ORR  and  CR  rate  were  both  significantly  higher  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  compared  to  the 
gemcitabine + rituximab group (61.9% vs. 43.9%, p=0.0007, and 35.5% vs. 21.7%, p=0.0047). However, 
these differences in ORR and CR rate did not lead to improvement of PFS or OS over gemcitabine + rituximab 
group.  The  MAH  has  not  been  able  to  clarify  the  possible  reasons  behind  the  discrepancy  and  the  clinical 
significance of the finding, that no correlation between ORR, CR, and OS were found. 
Overall response rate  
ORR per IRC assessment in the ITT population is presented in Table 5.22. A complete or partial response was 
reported  by  61.9%  [53.8,  69.6]  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  versus  43.9%  [36.0,  52.1]  in  the 
gemcitabine + rituximab group. The estimate of the difference between the two groups was 18.0% [6.9, 28.6]. 
Similar results were observed in the sensitivity analyses.

Analysis in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy for DLBCL or FL Grade 3 
The analysis of ORR in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy, per IRC assessment, showed a positive trend for 
pixantrone + rituximab in the subgroup of patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. 
Table 25 ORR (CR/PR) per IRC in patients with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy ITT population (Study PIX306) 
The ORR was significantly higher in the pixantrone group at the EOT time-point, and this finding became more 
robust  by  EOS.  During  the  follow-up  period,  two  additional  patients  achieved  a  complete  response,  both  of 
whom had been treated with pixantrone.

results were observed in the sensitivity analyses.

For comparison, the CR/Complete Response unconfirmed (Cru)-findings from study PIX301 are presented in 
Table 5.27. Of the 17 pixantrone patients who achieved a CR/CRu, 6 had stable or progressive disease as a 
response to their last regimen, 8 had a PR, and 3 had a CR/Cru. 
Table 29: CR/Cru rate by IAP-review (Study PIX301) 
comment 
The  ORR  and  CR  rate  were  both  significantly  higher  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  compared  to  the 
gemcitabine + rituximab group (61.9% vs. 43.9%, p=0.0007, and 35.5% vs. 21.7%, p=0.0047). However, 
these differences in ORR and CR rate did not lead to improvement of PFS or OS over gemcitabine + rituximab 
group. 
In the pivotal study PIX301, the CR/CFu-rate was the primary efficacy endpoint, with CR/CFu-rate of 20%. In 
the subgroup of patients with ≥ 2 lines of prior therapy (study PIX306), the CR-rate was 22.6% in the pixantrone 
+ rituximab group compared to 7.8% in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
Reaching a CR is an important step before possibly curative treatment like intensive chemotherapy + ASCT. In 
patients with basically a palliative approach like treatment with pixantrone with no curative intention, reaching 
a CR does not seem have a long term benefit.  
Exploratory endpoints 
Duration of overall response 
The median DOR (on KM analysis) was 10.0 months (95% CI [6.6, 17.3]) in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
versus 9.1 months (95% CI [6.5, 18.5]) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. The estimated HR for DOR in the 
pixantrone + rituximab group was 0.96 (95% CI [0.63, 1.47]). 
Duration of complete response 
The median DCR (on KM analysis) was 13.0 months (95% CI [7.1, 30.7]) in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
versus 15.4 months (95% CI [7.5, not evaluable]) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. The estimated HR for 
DCR in the pixantrone + rituximab group was 1.02 (95% CI [0.56, 1.88]). 
Patients receiving SCT after start of study treatment 
Four patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group (2.6%) and 2 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group

PK-modeling 
The aim of the PK substudy was to compare the pixantrone plasma concentrations measured during the current 
study (PIX306) in 14 patients, with the expected plasma concentrations predicted with the population PK model 
previously  developed  (Jumbe,  Quantitative  Solution  Modeling  and  Simulation  Report  2011).  The  measured 
concentrations are in agreement with the expected variability, and the median of the measured concentrations 
is in agreement with the simulated median profile.

comment 
The agreement between the simulated data from a previously developed population PK model and the newly 
observed concentrations is summarized in Figure 5.7. Within the figure, red points indicate newly observed data 
from the PIX306 study and the pink area represents the 90% interval for the simulated values. The black line 
indicates the median of observed data and the blue line indicates the median of simulated data. Overall, there

is no  visible difference between the concentrations observed in PIX306 study,  and the simulations from  the 
earlier  developed  population  PK  model;  this  indicates  that  pixantrone  time-concentration  data  in  patients 
receiving rituximab is not substantially different from the overall patient population characterised earlier and 
represented here by the population PK model.

pixantrone  was  combined  with  rituximab  for  153  patients,  which  slightly  complicates  the  comparison  of  the 
adverse event profiles of pixantrone between the two studies. 
In  both  studies,  the  pixantrone  doses  were  reduced  due  to  mainly  tolerability  issues.  In  PIX306  54.2%  of 
patients received less than 70% of the protocol dose. Only 50.3% of the patients received 6 out of 6 study cycles 
as  per  protocol.  For  gemcitabine  combined  with  rituximab,  the  dose  reductions  were  even  more  frequently 
needed: 73.2 received less than 70% of the protocol dose and 43.6% of the patients went through 6 out of 6 
study cycles. 
The  observed  dose  reductions  of  pixantrone  in  the  clinical  studies  and  clinical use  and  the  consequences  to 
efficacy/safety  of  pixantrone  is  being  evaluated  in  the  recently  initiated legally  binding  procedure  (LEG,  see 
Section 6.5 of this AR). 
Adverse events 
Overall, the frequency of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between groups except for 
the following (refer to Table 5.32): 
• 
• 
TEAEs leading to study drug reduction: reported in 23.5% in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 
65.1% of patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
TEAEs leading to rituximab dose interruption: reported in 41.2% of patients versus 28.9%, respectively.

Table 35 
TEAEs by SOC - safety population (Study PIX306) 
The most commonly (≥ 20%) reported TEAEs in the treatment groups were: 
In  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group:  neutropenia  (69.3%),  fatigue  (29.4%),  anaemia  (27.5%),  nausea 
(24.8%) and constipation (23.5%). 
In the gemcitabine + rituximab group: thrombocytopenia (65.8%), neutropenia (59.1%), anaemia (50.3%), 
pyrexia (25.5%), fatigue (23.5%) and oedema peripheral (20.8%). 
The incidence of the following TEAEs was numerically higher in the pixantrone + rituximab group than in the 
gemcitabine + rituximab group: neutropenia (69.3% versus 59.1%), constipation (23.5% versus 13.4%) and 
alopecia (19.0% versus 1.3%). Besides, the incidence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia was numerically lower 
in the pixantrone + R group than in the gemcitabine + R group (27.5% versus 50.3% and 16.3% versus 65.8%, 
respectively). 
In addition, myelodysplastic syndrome was reported in 4 patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 
none in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. Three of these events were reported as serious, and 2 had a fatal 
outcome. 
The percentage of patients with at least one related TEAE was similar in both groups: 
140 patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group (91.5%).

140 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group (94.0%). 
A summary of the TEAEs that were considered as related to the study treatment (pixantrone or gemcitabine), in 
2% or more patients in either group, is presented in Table 5.34. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs considered to be related to rituximab were (in at least 10% of patients in 
any group): neutropenia (37.9% in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 23.5% in the gemcitabine + R 
group),  anaemia  (11.1%  versus  19.5%,  respectively),  thrombocytopenia  (7.8%  versus  24.2%)  and  fatigue 
(12.4% versus 9.4%). 
comment 
It is to be noted that myelodysplastic syndromes were reported only from patients receiving pixantrone.

comment 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in study PIX306 patients receiving pixantrone + rituximab was comparable to 
that of study PIX301 patients receiving pixantrone monotherapy, 91.5% vs. 97.1%. For grade 3 to 4 TEAEs the 
figures were 85.0% and 76.5% implying to a worse tolerability of the combination therapy. E.g., neutropenia 
63.4%  vs.  41.2%,  anaemia  17.0%  vs.  5.9%,  or  lymphopenia,  5.9%  vs.  2.9%,  in  PIX306  vs.  PIX301, 
respectively. However, these trends were reversed when looking at the SAEs, refer below to section “Serious 
adverse events”. 
There  were  some  notable  differences  in  the  TEAE  profiles  between  the  treatments.  Neutropenia  was  more 
common in pixantrone +rituximab group, and anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia in gemcitabine + 
rituximab groups. These differences were also reflected to the number of transfusions the patients needed (any 
transfusion 8.5% vs 30.2%, platelets 0% vs 6.0%, RBCs 8.5% vs 28.9%, respectively) and to the use of growth 
factors (filgrastim was given to 66.0% and pegfilgrastim to 11.8% of pixantrone + rituximab patients, and to 
47.7% and 4.7% of the gemcitabine + rituximab patients respectively). 
Stomatitis, oral candidiasis, dysgeusia, and anorexia were more common in patients receiving pixantrone + 
rituximab. Skin discolouration affected 9.2% of pixantrone + rituximab patients and 0.7% of gemcitabine + 
rituximab patients. For the cardiovascular safety findings, refer to section “Other significant events” below.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
An overall summary of on-treatment deaths (i.e., deaths occurring on treatment and within 30 days of last dose 
of pixantrone or gemcitabine therapy), is presented in Table 5.36. Twelve patients in the pixantrone + rituximab 
group (7.8%) and 16 patients in the gemcitabine + rituximab group (10.7%) died within this timeframe. 
Table 38 Overall summary of deaths during the treatment period - Safety Population (Study PIX306) 
TEAEs  leading  to  death  were  reported  in  14  patients  (9.2%)  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  versus 
8 patients (5.4%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group.   
TEAEs leading to death that were reported by at least 2 patients in either group were (pixantrone + rituximab 
group versus gemcitabine + rituximab group): 
•  Myelodysplastic syndrome and pneumonia (each reported in 2 patients versus none). 
•  Cardiac failure (none versus 2 patients). 
•  Cardiac failure acute (none versus 3 patients).

comment 
The study groups were well balanced for the cardiac medical history and risk factors as well as for previous 
cardiotoxic treatments. 
Deaths due to cardiovascular events were slightly more common in the gemcitabine arm. Cardiac arrhythmias 
were observed in similar extent in both study groups. Cardiac failure was reported more from the gemcitabine 
group. The cardiovascular adverse event potential of pixantrone does not raise concerns. 
Assessment report

There were no other significant differences regarding deaths between the treatment groups, apart from 2 deaths 
due to myelodysplastic syndrome (and two further  cases of myelodysplastic syndrome) in the pixantrone + 
rituximab group. 
The  percentage  of  on-treatment  deaths  was  lower  in  PIX306  patients  receiving  pixantrone  +  rituximab 
compared to PIX301 patients receiving pixantrone monotherapy. 
Serious adverse events 
At least one treatment-emergent SAE was reported by 59 patients (38.6%) in the pixantrone + rituximab group 
versus 57 patients (38.3%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
The most frequently reported events were (pixantrone + rituximab versus gemcitabine + rituximab) 
• 
Pneumonia: 8 patients (5.2%) versus 4 patients (2.7%), respectively. 
•  Anaemia: 5 patients (3.3%) versus 8 patients (5.4%), respectively. 
• 
• 
Febrile neutropenia: 5 patients (3.3%) versus 1 patient (0.7%), respectively. 
Pyrexia: 4 patients (2.6%) versus 8 patients (5.4%) respectively. 
At least one treatment-emergent SAEs considered as treatment-related was reported in 30 patients (19.6%) in 
the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 22 patients (14.8%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group.

comment 
The incidences of serious treatment emergent adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment 
groups in study PIX306, including cardiotoxicity. 
In  study  PIX301  51.5%  of  the  patients  receiving  pixantrone  monotherapy  experienced  SAEs  vs.  38.6%  in 
PIX306: Blood and lymphatic system 22.1% vs. 7.8%, Infections and infestations 20.6% vs. 11.8%, Cardiac 
disorders  8.8%  vs.  6.5%,  etc.  From  this  point  of  view,  pixantrone  +  rituximab  appears  not  less  tolerable 
treatment than plain pixantrone. 
Other significant events 
Cardiovascular safety 
Overall, cardiac events were reported with similar frequencies in each treatment group: 60 patients (39.2%) in 
the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 55 patients (36.9%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group, refer to 
Tables 5.39 and 5.40. 
The most frequently reported events were (pixantrone + rituximab group versus gemcitabine + rituximab): 
• 
Edema peripheral: 12.4% versus 20.8%, respectively. 
•  Atrial fibrillation: 4.6% versus 4.7%, respectively. 
•  Cardiac failure: 3.3% versus 4.0%, respectively. 
• 
Ejection fraction decreased: 5.2% versus 0.7%, respectively. 
•  Syncope: 3.9% versus 1.3%, respectively. 
• 
Tachycardia: 2.0% versus 3.4%, respectively. 
Heart failure (congestive or not, acute or not) was reported by 6 patients (3.9%) in the pixantrone + rituximab 
group versus 11 patients (7.4%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. There was no emergent cardiac failure 
or cardiac failure acute leading to death in the pixantrone + rituximab group, while it was reported in 2 patients 
and 3 patients, respectively, in the gemcitabine + rituximab group. 
Cytotoxic cardiomyopathy was reported in 3 patients in the pixantrone + rituximab group (versus none) and 
cardiomegaly  in  2  patients  in  the  pixantrone  +  rituximab  group  (versus  none).  One  patient  recovered  from 
cytotoxic cardiomyopathy.

comment 
As already stated above, the study groups were well balanced for the cardiac medical history and risk factors as 
well as for previous cardiotoxic treatments. Deaths due to cardiovascular events were slightly more common in 
the gemcitabine arm. Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in similar extent in both study groups. Cardiac failure 
was reported more from the gemcitabine group. The cardiovascular adverse event potential of pixantrone does 
not raise concerns. 
Conversely, there seems to be no advantage of pixantrone over the comparator treatments (in both studies 
PIX301 and PIX306) regarding the cardiovascular safety or tolerability. 
Laboratory findings 
The most frequent emergent biochemical abnormalities of grade 3 or 4 (in at least 2% of patients in any group) 
were hyperglycaemia (8.5% in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 4.0% in the gemcitabine + rituximab 
group), hyponatremia (2.0% versus 0.7%, respectively), hypophosphatemia and AST increased (each in 2.0% 
versus 1.3%, respectively). 
Grade ≥ 3 abnormal laboratory values were sparse in both groups and for each parameter, see Table 5.42. 
Hy’s law criteria was defined as AST or ALT > 3  x ULN, total bilirubin > 2 x ULN, and alkaline phosphatase 
< 2 x ULN at the same visit. No patient met the Hy’s Law criteria.

comment 
There were no significant differences in the blood chemistry abnormalities between the treatment groups in 
PIX306. No Hepato-renal toxicity was reported. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of patients who withdrew due to TEAE was similar between groups: 33 patients (21.6%) in the 
pixantrone + rituximab group and 36 patients (24.2%) in the gemcitabine + rituximab group, refer to Table 5.X. 
Overall, the most frequent TEAEs that led to study drug withdrawal in the pixantrone + rituximab group versus 
gemcitabine + rituximab group were neutropenia in 8 patients (5.2%) versus 2 patients (1.3%), respectively, 
ejection fraction decreased in 5 patients (3.3%) versus none, respectively, and thrombocytopenia in 4 patients 
in each group (2.6% versus 2.7%, respectively).

Table 46 Analysis of TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation - safety population (Study PIX306) 
In  the  Safety  Population  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  that  led  to  study  drug  dose  reductions  was  lower  in  the 
pixantrone + rituximab group (23.5%) than in the gemcitabine + rituximab group (65.1%). 
Dose reductions were mainly due to neutropenia (18.3% versus 33.6%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia 
(1.3% versus 43.6%, respectively). Except for febrile neutropenia, reported in 2 patients in the pixantrone + 
rituximab  group  (versus  none  in  the  gemcitabine  group),  no  other  events  leading  to  dose  reduction  in  the 
pixantrone + rituximab group were reported in more than 1 patient. 
In the Safety Population, the incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug dose interruptions was similar in the 
pixantrone + rituximab group (75.8%) and the gemcitabine + rituximab group (74.5%). 
In the pixantrone + rituximab group, drug interruptions were mostly due to neutropenia (56.2% versus 34.2% 
in the gemcitabine + rituximab group). In the gemcitabine + rituximab group, drug interruptions were mostly 
due to thrombocytopenia (40.9% versus 9.8% in the pixantrone + rituximab group), neutropenia (see above), 
and anaemia (12.8% versus 2.0%, respectively).

comment 
The rate of discontinuations due to TEAEs was lower in study PIX306 patients receiving pixantrone + rituximab 
compared to study PIX301 patients receiving only pixantrone (42.6% vs. 21.6%), which implies to not worse 
tolerability of the combination treatment compared to monotherapy.

PIX203  Cyclophoshpamiede,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  prednisone  plus  rituximab  (CHOP-R)  and 
cyclophosphamide,  pixantrone,  vincristine,  prednisone  plus  rituximab  (CPOP-R)  in  patients  with 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A phase II, randomised, multicentre, comparative trial 
This study took place between 28 November 2005 and 20 August 2008. The study report was finalised on 15 
April 2011. The primary objective of this study was to compare the response rate of the cyclophosphamide, 
pixantrone, vincristine, and prednisone + rituximab (CPOP-R) regimen with the standard cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone + rituximab (CHOP-R) regimen and to show that the response rate for 
CPOP-R was not inferior to that of CHOP-R. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  the  OS,  PFS,  and  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  two  treatment 
regimens, including cardiac function. Other comparisons included duration of response (DOR), ORR, and time to 
treatment failure (TTF). 
Patients who discontinued treatment for disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity 
continued  in  the  follow-up  period  and  were  monitored  for  up  to  36  months  after  EOT.  AEs  were  monitored 
throughout  treatment.  Follow-up  therapies  and  cardiac  history  were  monitored  during  follow-up.  Cardiac 
function was assessed by multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) at baseline, after 
cycles 2, 4, and 6, at EOT, and 6, 12, and 24 months after EOT. 
Study  enrolment  was  terminated  for  business  reasons,  not  safety  concerns,  on  31  January  2008  with 
124 patients enrolled in the study. 61 patients in the CPOP-R arm and 63 patients in CHOP-R arm. 
The main inclusion criteria: Patients aged ≥18 years with untreated, histologically confirmed, CD20-positive, 
DLBCL  NHL  according  to  Revised  European-American  Lymphoid  Neoplasm/World  Health  Organization 
(REAL/WHO) classification were included. Additional requirements for inclusion were stage II, III, or IV disease; 
adequate organ function and ECOG performance status (PS) ≤2. 
Experimental group: On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, patients received pixantrone (active ingredient: pixantrone 
dimaleate)  150mg/m2  IV,  cyclophosphamide  (750  mg/m2  IV),  vincristine  (1.4  mg/m2  IV),  and  rituximab 
(375 mg/m2 IV). Prednisone (100 mg) was administered orally once daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. 
Comparator  group:  On  Day  1  of  each  21-day  cycle,  patients  received  doxorubicin  (50  mg/m2  IV), 
cyclophosphamide  (750mg/m2  IV),  vincristine  (1.4  mg/m2  IV),  and  rituximab  (375  mg/m2  IV).  Prednisone 
(100 mg) was administered orally once daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  CR/CRu  rate,  defined  as  the  total  proportion  of  patients  in  the  intent-to-treat 
population  with  a  CR  or  complete  response  unconfirmed  (CRu)  as  assessed  by  the  IAP  according  to  the 
International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria. Secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, ORR, duration of 
response, and TTF. 
Safety parameters included AEs and their severity, duration, and relationship to treatment. AE severity was 
defined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)

version 3.0. AEs of particular interest were grade 3 and 4 cardiac events, whether considered related to study 
drug or not, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreases. 
As of the final Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the required total sample size for at least 80% power, assuming a 
15%  non-inferiority  margin,  was  138  patients  per  arm,  assuming  a  5%  dropout  rate.  Given  a  total  of 
124 patients as the final sample size, this study was not sufficiently powered to detect statistical significance. OS 
and  other  time  to  event  endpoints  were  analysed  K-M  methods.  The  unstratified  log-rank  test  was  used  to 
compare the K-M curves across the two arms. Descriptive statistics were provided for baseline and demographic 
characteristics,  efficacy  endpoints,  and  safety.  Where  appropriate,  95%  CIs  were  calculated  under  the 
assumption. The primary analysis was based on the IAP assessment of the ITT population; supportive analyses 
were performed in the histologically confirmed intent-to-treat (HITT) and the per-protocol (PP) populations. 
Demographic characteristics were generally well-balanced between treatment groups for mean age, age group, 
gender, distribution of race, mean weight, smoking status, and ECOG PS. No statistically significant differences 
were observed between treatment groups for any demographic variable. Baseline disease characteristics were 
well balanced between the two treatment groups for type of biopsy, current Ann Arbor stage of NHL, current 
International Prognostic Index (IPI) and distribution, and number of extranodal sites. All patients had DLBCL 
according to the investigator’s assessment. 
The ORR for the CPOP-R arm was 82% compared to 87% for the CHOP-R arm. The PFS analysis demonstrated 
a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.03 (95% CI = 0.55, 1.91). Median PFS was not reached for the CPOP-R arm. 
OS  was  significantly  better  for  patients  treated  with  CHOP-R  compared  to  those  treated  with  CPOP-R  (p  = 
0.032). The HR was 2.34 (95% CI = 1.05, 5.22). Median OS was not reached for either arm.

CPOP-R produced a CR/CRu rate of 72% and an ORR of 82% compared to 79% and 87% for CHOP-R. The PFS 
analysis demonstrated a HR of 1.03 (95% CI = 0.55, 1.91). OS for CHOP-R patients was better (for unknown 
reasons) than for CPOP-R patients and was also higher than that reported in recent large randomized studies. 
Similar  proportions  of  patients  experienced  SAEs,  treatment  related  AEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation or interruption. The incidence of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis, including grade 
3/4 events, was comparable between arms. More CHOP-R than CPOP-R patients had congestive heart failure 
(CHF), >20% declines in LVEF, and increases in troponin T levels. 
There were more deaths in the CPOP-R group; three occurred during the treatment period, one of which was 
related to study drug. There were no deaths in the CHOP-R arm during the treatment period. Of 14 deaths on the 
CPOP-R arm and 9 deaths on the CHOP-R that occurred more than 30 days after study treatment, most were in 
the context of progressive disease and in elderly patients with IPI scores ≥3. 
comment 
In study PIX203, the non-inferiority assumption of R-CPOP treatment compared to R-CHOP (the established, 
standard  first-line  treatment)  was  not  met.  OS  was  significantly  higher  in  the  CHOP-R  treatment  group 
compared to CPOP-R treatment group. 
In the first-line treatment of DLBCL, like in this study, the efficacy of the treatment is of foremost interest. Today 
most of the DLBCL patients can be cured with CHOP-R treatment. However, despite of this effective treatment 
option, at least 30% will eventually relapse. If the  long-term efficacy of the  proposed alternative treatment 
(replacing doxorubicin with pixantrone) is not at least at the same level, then there is no possibility or need to 
change the established first line treatment. 
The result from this study imposes some question marks also on the potential efficacy of pixantrone after the use 
of CHOP-R therapy, like in the approved indication. However, the dose of pixantrone was not the same (it was 
much higher than in studies PIX301 or PIX306) and the patient population was different (first line vs. second or 
later lines). 
AZA302  An  open-label,  randomized,  phase  III  comparative  trial  of  BBR  2778  +  rituximab  versus 
rituximab  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  indolent  non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) 
This study took place between 11 August 2004 and 19 January 2005. The study report was finalised on 05 
September 2007. 
The primary objective was to compare the time to tumour progression (TTP) of the combination of BBR 2778 
(pixantrone) + rituximab with that of rituximab alone. 
Secondary objectives were to compare between the objective overall response rate (ORR; CR + PR), objective 
complete  response  rate  (CRR),  rate  of  molecular  remission,  time  to  response,  time  to  complete  response, 
duration  of  response,  time  to  tumour  progression  requiring  treatment,  quality-adjusted  time  to  progression 
(QATTP),  overall  survival,  disease-specific  survival,  and  safety/tolerability  with  a  particular  focus  on  cardiac 
safety. 
This was a multinational, controlled, randomized, multi-centre, open-label study in patients with indolent NHL 
who had experienced up to 5 episodes of progressive disease after prior treatments. Patients were randomly 
assigned  to  receive  pixantrone  +  rituximab  (experimental  group)  or  rituximab  alone  (control  group). 
Chemotherapy was administered in cycles repeated every 21 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 93/107 
  
  
Patients  in  the  experimental  arm  received  rituximab  on  day  1,  pixantrone  on  day  2,  and  rituximab  and 
pixantrone  on  day  8  of  cycle  1;  rituximab  and  pixantrone  on  day  1 and  day  8  of  cycle  2;  and  single  agent 
pixantrone on day 1 and day 8 of cycles 3 through 6. 
Patients in the control arm received rituximab as directed by the rituximab label for indolent NHL, administered 
as  4  once-weekly  infusions  on  days  1,  8,  and  15  of  cycle  1  and  day  1  of  cycle  2  (day  22).  Patients  could 
discontinue treatment for progressive disease, toxicity, protocol noncompliance, patient request, physician’s 
decision, or administrative reasons. 
Patients were treated for up to six 21-day cycles or until treatment was discontinued due to progressive disease, 
toxicity, protocol noncompliance, patient request, physician’s decision, or administrative reasons. 
A total of 800 patients (including drop-outs) were planned to be enrolled in this study. The study was closed 
early due to poor enrolment. All 38 patients who were enrolled were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. 
Eligible patients had histologically-confirmed relapsed or refractory CD20+ indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL), were ECOG PS 0 or 1, ≥18 years of age, and had measurable disease. Patients had to have adequate 
hematologic, cardiac, renal, and hepatic function at baseline. Patients were not eligible if they were resistant to 
rituximab or anthracycline during previous treatment cycles, had previous bone marrow or stem cell transplant, 
had prior treatment with a cumulative dose of doxorubicin equivalent exceeding 450 mg/m2, or had clinically 
significant cardiac abnormalities. 
Efficacy: Objective tumour assessments were to be made every other cycle and disease response was defined 
according  to  International  Workshop  to  Standardize  Response  Criteria  for  non-Hodgkin’s  Lymphomas.  The 
objective tumour response (CR or PR) was to be confirmed in 2 consecutive instances performed not less than 
1 month apart. Time to tumour progression was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first 
objective  disease  progression  or  the  last  date  the  patient  was  assessed  and  found  to  be  progression  free. 
Objective tumour assessments were evaluated by the reporting investigator. Post hoc sponsor medical monitor 
review  of  the  investigator  reported  efficacy  was  also  performed  to  ensure  uniform  application  of  protocol 
definitions of confirmed response between investigative sites. No blind independent panel assessments were 
performed. 
Safety: Adverse events were assessed throughout the study and graded according to NCICTC,  v. 2 criteria. 
Safety  parameters  included  laboratory  evaluations  including  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  urinalysis,  and 
LVEF measured by MUGA. In addition, patients were followed for toxicity for 30 days following the off-treatment 
visit (approximately 127 days from the first infusion of study medication) or until recovery of abnormal results 
to baseline values. Toxicity assessment included clinically relevant laboratory and LVEF abnormalities. Cardiac 
safety was assessed with particular attention as all cardiac adverse events even those felt to be unrelated to 
study drug were reported in a similar time frame of a serious adverse event. 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  pixantrone  +  rituximab  or  rituximab  alone.  Randomization  was 
stratified at baseline by: 
International Prognostic Index (IPI) Score 
• 
•  Number of prior episodes of disease progression 
• 
Prior anti CD20 regimen 
The efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population. TTP was the primary efficacy endpoint. The comparison 
of TTP between treatment groups was made using K-M survival curves and the log-rank test statistic. 
ORR  and  CR  were  computed  for  both  treatment  groups.  Safety  variables  (including  toxicity  assessments, 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 94/107 
  
  
adverse events, laboratory values, and physical examination results) were summarized by descriptive statistics 
for patients who received any study treatments. 
All 38 patients who were enrolled received study treatment, 20 in the experimental arm and 18 in the control 
arm.  The  treatment  groups  were  generally  well  balanced  in  terms  of  baseline  characteristics.  The  patients 
receiving pixantrone + rituximab were somewhat older (this is also reflected in the IPI scores, where age is one 
factor). The median age of the subjects in the experimental arm was 67.0 years (range 52.0-77.0), while in the 
control arm it was 58.5 (45.0-74.0). The comparator arm was predominately male (72%), whereas there was an 
equal number of males and females in the pixantrone arm. There were slightly more patients with high baseline 
IPI scores (>2) in the pixantrone arm (30%) than in the comparator arm (11%). 
Estimated  median  TTP  was  150  days  longer  in  the  experimental  arm  (395  vs.  245  days,  p  <0.001). 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis predicted that 100% of patients treated with rituximab alone would have 
progressed within one year of treatment. By contrast, patients in the experimental arm had an estimated 32% 
probability of disease progression after 1 year (p < 0.001) and 55% at 2 years (p = 0.002). 
Table 47: Efficacy results in AZA302 
The overall response rate assessed by the primary investigator was 75% in the experimental arm vs. 33% in the 
control arm (CR, CRu and PR; p = 0.038). Post hoc sponsor medical review of efficacy recorded similar results: 
experimental group ORR (65%) vs. control group ORR (33%) [p = 0.1013]. Four of 6 patients with a baseline IPI 
score of 3 or 4 achieved PR in the experimental arm. The two patients with IPI score 3 or 4 in the control arm 
failed to respond to treatment. 
The only severe toxicity was neutropenia (12 grade 3/4 adverse events of neutropenia were reported in the 
experimental arm vs. 0 in the control arm). Cytopenias, GI symptoms, fatigue, alopecia, and LVEF declines of 
≥ 10% were reported more commonly in the pixantrone and rituximab treatment group. Five patients in the 
experimental arm reported a decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% from baseline, compared to one patient treated with 
single agent rituximab. All reports of decreased LVEF were grades 1 or 2, were generally asymptomatic and 
most  often  returned  toward  baseline  with  continued  dosing.  Transient  subacute  congestive  heart  failure 
developed in a 70 year old male 5 days after receiving his first dose of pixantrone. The CHF resolved and the 
investigator attributed the CHF to underlying NHL. Following resolution of the CHF no additional cardiovascular 
adverse events were reported with continued dosing of pixantrone (six cycles) in this patient. Adverse events 
leading to premature discontinuation of study medication were seen only in the experimental arm (6 patients).

Two  patients  discontinued  for  severe  neutropenia,  1  for  febrile  neutropenia,  1  for  nausea  (grade  2,  with 
simultaneous grade 1 headache and dyspnoea), 1 for decreased LVEF (grade 2), and 1 for hepatitis (grade 2). 
The patient with decreased LVEF was asymptomatic and discontinuation was required per protocol (decline in 
LVEF  ≥  grade  2).  The  patient  with  discontinuation  attributed  to  hepatitis  recorded  no  clinically  significant 
abnormal liver function tests in available routine study chemistries. Four patients in the pixantrone group and 
5 patients in the rituximab only group experienced 
Serious Adverse Events; one of these (febrile neutropenia) in the experimental arm led to discontinuation. SAEs 
in  the  experimental  arm  were  febrile  neutropenia,  thrombosis,  abdominal  distension,  exertional  dyspnea, 
peripheral oedema, neutropenia, and subacute cardiac failure (discussed above). In the control group, SAEs 
included headache, pyrexia/leukopenia, limb and neck pain,  rigors with hypotension following initial dose of 
rituximab,  infection  following  dog  bite,  LVEF  decrease,  and  incidental  anaplastic  carcinoma  (primary  site 
unknown). 
comment 
The population recruited into study AZA302 consisted of relapsed follicular lymphoma patients. The prognosis 
and  estimated  treatment  efficacy  in  second  line  is  much  higher  compared  to  patients  with  relapsed,  more 
aggressive lymphoma, DLBCL. 
In this study, pixantrone + rituximab performed better than rituximab alone, which is hardly surprising. 
It  is  difficult  to  draw  any  other  conclusions  from  this  very  small  study  (38  patients)  with  different  patient 
population than in studies PIX301 and PIX306. 
5.4.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
During  the  period  covered  by  this  annual  renewal,  new  data  regarding  SOBs  have  emerged.  The  new  data 
emerged data are compliant in terms of acceptability of data submitted. 
6.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the assessment 
of the benefit/risk balance 
6.1.  Quality 
From the last renewal to date, the following changes have been approved: change of specification for the Drug 
Product,  and  change  in  the  specification  parameters  of  the  immediate  packaging  of  the  finished  product 
(Deletion of the statement “treated with sulfate or equivalent”). 
These quality changes do not impact the benefit/risk ratio of the product. 
6.2.  Non-clinical 
No new data or updates have been submitted since the previous annual renewal. 
6.3.  Clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  analysis  in  the  sub-study  of  PIX306  is  acceptable  if  the  sponsor  is  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  PK 
samples are stable over the storage period of 576 days. Overall, the probability of an interaction potential is low 
because according to in vitro investigations, pixantrone is primarily metabolised by N-acetyltransferase. Thus, 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 96/107 
  
  
the potential of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to affect pixantrone PK is considered low. 
The agreement between the simulated data from a previously developed population PK model and the newly 
observed concentrations was summarized. Overall, there was no visible difference between the concentrations 
observed in PIX306 study, and the simulations from the earlier developed population PK model; this indicated 
that pixantrone time-concentration data in patients receiving rituximab was not substantially different from the 
overall  patient  population  characterised  earlier  and  represented  here  by  the  population  PK  model.  The 
comparison was visual, and the MAH was requested to provide more rigorous statistical tests to assess the lack 
of  rituximab  effect  on  PK  of  pixantrone.  The  MAH  provided  the  requested  statistical  tests  and  no  effect  of 
rituximab on PK of pixantrone could be seen.   
6.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No additional data have been made available/submitted since the previous annual renewal. 
6.5.  Clinical safety 
Pixantrone  is  marketed in  25  countries  during  the  review  period,  including  Austria,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, 
Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and Israel. 
The PDCO discussed the PIP modification request on 28 May 2018. Based on the high cure rate of disease with 
first  line  treatment,  the  modest  activity  of  pixantrone  in  paediatric  preclinical  models,  the  high  competitive 
environment with novel innovative drugs leading to feasibility challenges and the long-term cardiotoxicity of 
pixantrone, PDCO was on favour of granting a waiver for pixantrone for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In 
second discussion, based on the review of the rationale submitted by the application for modifying the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan, the PDCO considered that the proposed changes could be accepted. The PDCO 
therefore  adopted  a  favourable  Opinion  on  the  modification  of  the  agreed  PIP  as  set  in  the  Agency’s  latest 
decision (P/0310/2016 of 4 November 2016) and on the granting of a product-specific waiver. The new PDCO 
Opinion on the modified agreed PIP supersedes the previous PDCO Opinion. 
There have been no actions taken for safety reasons in this renewal period. 
The SmPC dated 23 August 2018 is the RSI. The list of adverse events in the SmPc (section 4.8) was amended 
to identify ‘Sepsis” as a commonly occurring event and “Hepatotoxicity” as uncommon occurring event. The RSI 
in the IB already notes Sepsis and Hepatotoxicity, hence no updates to the IB were warranted at this time. 
The  Investigational  Brochure  (IB)  Version  18  and  19  were  approved  on  23  Feb  2018  and  13  Apr  2018, 
respectively. Administrative changes were made to the RSI per requests from Belgium (FAMHPS) regarding their 
recently issued guidance, Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) Question and Answer Document – Reference 
Safety Information. 
The MAH states that surveillance of adverse event data across commercial, medical information, product quality 
complaints, clinical and literature sources warrants no modification to the pixantrone risk assessment.

Marketing exposure 
Cumulative and interval exposure is difficult to ascertain as the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) has little 
visibility  into  product  utilization  from  the  wholesaler  or  customer  (e.g.  Hospital  or  Pharmacy)  given  the 
indication for use and prescribed dosing regimen. CTI is informed indirectly of patient utilization only as a result 
of requests to refill orders; however, this data does not represent a direct correlation to single patient use. 
Commercial  exposure  has  been  estimated  based  on  1)  historical  data  that  describes  the  average  patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 98/107 
  
  
 
 
 
 
receiving 2 cycles of pixantrone; 2) Body Surface Area (BSA) calculations outlined in the SmPC for an average 
weight patient which estimate the number of vials/units used per infusion as 3; and 3) the assumption that one 
cycle (with 3 recommended infusions) requires between 9 and 12 units/vials per patient as a total of 59507 units 
of product. 
Safety data 
There  was  a  total  of  4  cases  reported  during  the  review  period  associated  with  cardiotoxicity  which  were 
assessed as serious and related to pixantrone across all sources; one report of tachycardia (grade 3); one report 
of cardiotoxicity (grade unknown), one report of cardiac failure (grade unknown) and one report of cytotoxic 
cardiomyopathy  (grade  2).  None  of  these  cases  represent  an  unforeseen  risk  nor  occurred  at  an  increased 
frequency or severity observed for this identified risk during the review period. 
During the review period, 67 serious myelotoxic events considered related to pixantrone originating from across 
all sources and included events of anaemia, bicytopenia, febrile neutropenia, granulocytopenia, pancytopenia 
and  haematoxicity  originating  from  clinical  and  post  marketing  environment.  The  patients  for  whom  these 
events were reported often times had myelosuppressive risk factors which might have played a key role in the 
events.  Myelotoxicity  is  an  expected  side-effect  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  The  key  toxicities  with  pixantrone  are 
associated with falls in white cell counts, particularly neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as falls in platelet 
counts and the reported cases during this review period are consistent with very commonly occurring events as 
per the SmPC. 
Two unrelated SAEs of disease progression were reported which led to a fatal outcome. Given that Pixuvri is 
indicated for patients with relapsed, refractory NHL who have failed multiple lines of treatment, expected clinical 
outcomes include progressive disease and death. These types of events will still be monitored for increased 
frequency or change in pattern. Precluding increased frequency of this event type, progressive disease will be 
described only within the aggregated reports. 
No reports of tumour lysis syndrome were received during the review period. One new case of acute myeloid 
leukaemia (grade 5) was received and a follow-up for cases and was also received adding information on prior 
NHL therapy and disease course and update to the verbatim term from leukaemia monocytic (grade 4) to acute 
myelomonocytic leukaemia (grade 4). 
Sixteen cases were reported where in pixantrone was used in an off- label condition. Of these cases, events 
associate with off label usage included neutropenia (grade 4), pyrexia (grade unknown), febrile neutropenia 
(grade  unknown),  sepsis  (grade  unknown),  thrombocytopenia  (grade  unknown),  febrile  neutropenia  (grade 
unknown), diarrhoea (grade unknown); drug ineffective (grade unknown) was reported in two patients. Given 
the limited information available from the cases, notably related to current disease status, prior medical history 
and  concomitant  conditions,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  whether  or  not  pixantrone  was  causally  related to  these 
events. 
Other  reported  toxicities,  including  infections  (pneumonia,  bronchitis,  cytomegalovirus  infection  and  urinary 
tract  infection),  gastrointestinal  events  (rectal  haemorrhage,  stomatitis),  respiratory  events  (atelectasis, 
pulmonary  thrombosis  and  pneumonia  aspiration)  and  general  physical  health  deterioration  (grade  4)  while 
often serious varied in nature and were without any pattern or trend. 
Safety continues to be monitored in elderly patients exposed to pixantrone. As of the data cut off, approximately 
407 patients aged 65 years and above have been treated with pixantrone since the DIBD. Of these 407 patients, 
160 originated from completed studies, approximately 247 from the PIX306 study. After further review of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250839/2019 
Page 99/107 
  
  
events experienced by the patients there is no pattern or trend in the cases suggesting any greater risks for any 
adverse event in this population. 
In all, as of 31 August 2018, at least 724 patients have received Pixuvri alone or in combination with other 
agents in clinical trials, and 2479 patients are estimated to have been treated, mainly in Europe, since the first 
marketing  authorisation  in  May  2012.  A  review  of  the  adverse  event  profile  for  the  compound,  from  data 
originating from the PIX306 clinical trial, post marketing sources, named patient programs, non-interventional 
studies and market research programs and donation programs has identified no new and/or unforeseen risks 
associated with pixantrone exposure. 
Since  the  last  annual  reassessment,  safety  data  from  ongoing  trials  and  post-marketing  sources  has  been 
assessed in PSUR procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009261/201805 (PSUR #12). Much of the data presented in 
this annual reassessment overlaps with that in the recent PSUR procedure(s). 
PRAC is aware of more than anticipated cases of dose skipping due to adverse reactions associated to pixantrone 
treatment in the PIX Real study, which was terminated early in Feb 2016. It remains currently unknown whether 
the  dose  skipping  due  to  adverse  effects  has  influence  on  the  efficacy  of  the  product,  and  thus  indicates 
dissimilar B/R profile compared to one expected based on the original pivotal clinical trial. The issue has been 
further elaborated in the PSUSA procedure, but at the time of finalisation of the PSUSA procedure in Dec 2018 
PRAC meeting, there were still open questions. PRAC therefore considers that it is necessary to further explore 
this issue within a LEG procedure. In the LEG procedure initiated, the MAH should provide: 
• 
• 
• 
For all phase III trials (including PIX306): number and proportion of patients with a) dose lowering (i.e., 
dose  given  on  schedule  at  a  lower  amount),  b)  dose  omission/skipping.  Reason  for  dose 
lowering/omission for each one of these patients (i.e., toxicity/ADR or any other reason). Provide all 
relevant  CIOMS  forms,  and  provide  an  explanation  for  any  instances  where  the  reason  for  dose 
reduction is not known. 
For  PIXreal:  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  a)  dose  lowering,  b)  dose  omission/skipping. 
Reason for dose lowering/omission for each one of these patients.  The MAH is asked to provide CIOMS 
forms for all patients within the PIXreal study regardless of whether doses were skipped or not), and 
provide an explanation for any instances where the reason for dose reduction is not known. 
For PIX306, please also provide a discussion of the rate of dose omission and reasons for it. Please also 
provide a rationale for the differences in dose modification criteria in this study compared to that in the 
pivotal studies and the SmPC guidance. 
•  A discussion of any impact of dose lowering, delay, or omission, on the safety or efficacy of pixantrone, 
in view of the totality of the data. The MAH should discuss whether changes to the product information 
or any other risk minimisation measures are warranted. 
The search criteria and mechanisms used by the MAH to identify all relevant cases should be detailed in the 
responses. 
comment:  
It is notified that the above mentioned ongoing LEG procedure concerning more frequent than anticipated dose 
skipping due to adverse reactions associated to pixantrone treatment in the PIX Real study, and the possible 
influence on the efficacy of the product, may be seen remotely relevant also for this procedure in which B/R is 
scrutinized.  However,  as  it  is  separate  parallel  ongoing  procedure,  it  is  not  possible  to  incorporate  any 
conclusions into this AR yet.

6.6.  Pharmacovigilance inspections 
A MHRA statutory inspection of the CTI pharmacovigilance system was conducted from October 23-26, 2017 
which identified 5 major findings. A follow-up statutory inspection by the ANSM of the CTI pharmacovigilance 
system was conducted from June 12 – 15, 2018 to  confirm CAPA implementation arising from the previous 
MHRA inspection. It allows further inspection of areas not reviewed during the previous inspection. One major 
finding specific to CTI practices and procedures in updating the PSMF was identified. The MAH stated that while 
these  observations  contributed  to  improve  management  of  the  pharmacovigilance  system,  neither  the  root 
cause analyses nor impact assessments for these findings identified gaps that adversely affected the risk/benefit 
profile of the compound, nor adversely affected the rights, safety or well-being of patients. 
6.7.  Discussion 
A  review  of  adverse  events  and  other  safety  information  from  the  ongoing  PIX-306  clinical  trial  and 
post-marketing sources does not warrant modification to the risk assessment of pixantrone. No major issues 
have been identified during this review period. 
7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH has submitted an updated RMP within the annual renewal procedure (RMP version 10.1, data lock point 
31 August 2018). 
Summary of significant changes in the RMP: 
• 
Implementation of the new template (EMA GVP Module V, rev. 2, RMP template) 
•  Update with post marketing data (DLP 31 August 2018)

The MAH has revised safety specifications according to the guidance of new EMA GVP Module V rev. 2 (28 March 
2017, EMA/838713/2011). In RMP revision from version 10 to version 10.1 the MAH suggests shortening of the 
safety specification to include above mentioned important identified risks. Deletion of all other risks is suggested 
(See Table 2 below). 
Summary  of  the  safety  concerns  as  presented  in  the  RMP  version  10.0.  Proposed  deletions  marked  with 
strikethrough and red font.

In general the deletions can be accepted since the safety concerns proposed to be removed are not critical for 
B/R; are not considered requiring additional RMMs beyond the routine RMMs (mainly SmPC text) and/or no 
additional PhV activities are indicated. 
MAH has provided characterisation of the data and description of routine risk minimisation measures concerning 
three identified risks in the RMP. Based on the existing data the MAH has not specified any need for additional 
pharmacovigilance actions or additional risk minimisation measures to further characterise and/or minimise the 
risks in addition to routine pharmacovigilance.

Important Identified Risks Cardiotoxicity and Myelotoxicity are key risks with potentially critical impact on the 
benefit/risk. Therefore, they should remain as Important Identified Risks in the RMP at the moment, even if no 
additional PhV activities or additional RMMs are specified for them. 
The MAH was asked to further justify the critical impact of suggested important identified risk Tumour lysis 
syndrome on risk benefit balance of the product and discuss the potential need of further additional 
pharmacovigilance activities and/or risk minimisation measures to address uncertainties related to this risk, or 
alternatively remove Tumour lysis syndrome from the list of important safety concerns. 
The MAH responded that Tumour lysis syndrome should be removed from safety specifications, since no 
additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures are considered needed to 
further characterise or minimise this risk. The MAH will submit an updated RMP at the end of this renewal 
procedure. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
The MAH states that important identified risks are well characterised and therefore, routine pharmacovigilance 
activities are deemed sufficient. There are no additional pharmacovigilance activities suggested. 
In  RMP  v.  10  four  studies  were  listed  in  PhV  Plan.  Three  of  these  studies  were  paediatric  studies  that  are 
considered to be part of paediatric investigation plan and may be deleted from the RMP in the update of RMP 
according to the guidance of new EMA GVP Module V rev. 2 (28 March 2017, EMA/838713/2011). 
In more details, in the previous RMP version (version 10.0) the following on-going and planned additional PhV 
studies/activities in the Pharmacovigilance Plan were listed; proposed deletions marked with strikethrough and 
red font:

Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product. 
Category 2 are Specific Obligations in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances under Article 
14(8) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 or in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation under Article 14(7) of Regulation 
(EC) 726/2004. 
Category  3  are  required  additional  PhV  activity  (to  address  specific  safety  concerns  or  to  measure  effectiveness  of  risk

PIX306 study was included in the post-authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan in the previous 
version of RMP (v. 10). PIX306 study is specific obligation in context of a conditional marketing authorisation and 
the study has been recently completed. The final study report has been submitted as part of the annual renewal 
application. The MAH has replaced the PIX306 study into the post-authorisation efficacy development plan, 
including planned and ongoing post-authorisation efficacy studies in the revised RMP, since primary objective of 
this study is to evaluate the efficacy. 
The following table has been included in the RMP under part IV Plans for Post-Authorisation Efficacy Studies 
In conclusion:

•  Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
•  Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation activities are considered sufficient to manage the safety concerns of the medicinal 
product. No additional risk minimisation measures have been proposed. 
Summary table of Risk Minimisation Measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indications.

Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP require revision following the removal of Tumour lysis syndrome 
from safety specification. The MAH will submit updated RMP at the end of this renewal procedure. 
Annexes 
The RMP annexes have been updated appropriately. 
7.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The RMP version 11, submitted in conclusion of this renewal procedure, is acceptable. 
8.  Changes to the Product Information 
Changes to the Product Information (PI), based on the submitted data within the scope of this procedure, are 
introduced during the assessment of this renewal. 
The final PI proposal is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Pixuvri (pixantrone) is removed from the additional 
monitoring list as the condition(s) to the marketing authorisation have been fulfilled. 
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow 
quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed 
from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

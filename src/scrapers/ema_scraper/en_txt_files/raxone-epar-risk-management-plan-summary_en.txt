Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan  
Summary of risk management plan for Raxone 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Raxone®. The RMP details important risks 
of Raxone®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Raxone®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Raxone®'s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Raxone® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Raxone® should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all  which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current  ones will be included in updates of  Raxone®'s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Raxone® is authorised for the treatment of LHON (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
idebenone as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Raxone®’s benefits can be found in Raxone®’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/raxone. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Raxone®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Raxone®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Raxone® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
 
 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Raxone®  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Raxone®. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term 
use of the medicine);

reactive depression and may present behavioural traits of alcohol abuse 
and dependence which will predispose them to liver toxicity.

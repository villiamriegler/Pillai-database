1. 
Introduction 
Renagel  (sevelamer),  a  non-absorbed,  calcium  and  metal-free  phosphate  binder,  was  authorised  in 
Europe under centralised procedure on 28 January 2000 for the indication of  
“control  of  hyperphosphatemia  in  adult  patients  on  haemodialysis  (HD)  Renagel  should  be  used 
within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25 
– dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease” 
and  is  currently  marketed  in  most  EU  countries  and  worldwide.  Renagel  was  authorised  under 
exceptional circumstances but this was lifted recently (Commission Decision 26 June 2006) following 
fulfilment of all specific obligations by the MAH. 
The MAH applied for this Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/254/II/56) to extend the indication to patients 
on  peritoneal  dialysis  (PD).  The  application  is  supported  by  a  clinical  study  in  patients  receiving 
peritoneal dialysis (study REN00304) and relevant literature. 
2 
Clinical aspects 
The data presented by the MAH reviews the benefit/risk profile of Renagel in patients on peritoneal 
dialysis (PD) taking into account protocol REN00304 PD study and relevant efficacy and safety data 
available since the marketing authorisation. 
The study REN00304 compared the effects of  dosed three times daily with meals and calcium acetate 
on serum phosphorus control in peritoneal dialysis patients, and evaluated the safety and tolerability of  
in this population. The results demonstrated non inferiority of  compared to calcium acetate in terms of 
reduction  from  baseline  in  serum  phosphorus  level.  The  study  also  confirmed  the  safety  profile  that 
was similar to that already established in the haemodialysis population. 
The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP, as stated by the MAH.  
As patients with late chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 have minimal or no residual renal function, 
the excretory function of the kidney must be substituted via dialysis, ether haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis. The approach to treatment of hyperphosphataemia for both dialysis modalities is essentially 
the same. As renal failure progresses, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls and renal excretion of 
phosphorus  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  maintain  normal  serum  phosphorus  levels  in  the  face  of 
continuing  absorption  of  phosphorus  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and  mobilization  of  phosphorus 
from  bone.  Consequently,  hyperphosphataemia  develops,  usually  in  association  with  low  levels  of 
calcitriol and worsening hyperparathyroidism. Hyperphosphataemia is associated also with increased 
renal bone disease (renal osteodystrophy), increased cardiovascular and other soft tissue calcification 
and increased mortality. 
Dietary  phosphate  restriction  and/or  dialysis  are  usually  insufficient  to  adequately  control  serum 
phosphorus. Therefore, phosphate binders are used by almost all dialysis patients to decrease intestinal 
absorption  of  phosphate  to  the  point  that  dialytic  clearance  can  maintain  an  acceptable  serum 
phosphorus concentration ideally between 1.13 - 1.77 mmol/l for stage 5 adult patients. 
Peritoneal dialysis is one of two dialysis modalities to treat chronic uraemic patients. Haemodialysis is 
used more extensively than peritoneal dialysis, but there is a wide variation in practice across different 
countries. Coagulation abnormalities, lipid abnormalities and fluid overload are commonly felt to be 
more common in peritoneal dialysis patients although new onset cardiovascular disease is seen similar 
rate in both modalities. Comparable outcomes have been reported over the last 10 years. 
The phosphate binders currently available contain mainly calcium or sometimes aluminium, which are 
associated  with  a  variety  of  undesirable  effects.  Sevelamer  hydrochloride,  a  non-absorbable 
phosphate-binding  polymer,  was  synthesised  to  enhance  phosphorus  excretion  while  minimising

systemic effects observed with other phosphorus binders. There are also some evidence that  may have 
beneficial effect on a number of plasma biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid, bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase, random blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin). 
2.1  Clinical efficacy 
Main study (REN00304) 
The  MAH  presented  one  clinical  study,  protocol  REN00304.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to 
evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  compared  with  calcium  acetate  in 
peritoneal dialysis patients. 
The study was a phase 3, multicentre, open label, and randomised, parallel group study. A total of 15 
investigators from 17 investigative sites in Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, 
and United Kingdom participated in this study. The first patient was enrolled in December 2004 and 
the last patient completed in March 2006. Calcium acetate was used as the control group.  
Study population 
A  total  of  150  patients  were  planned  for  randomisation.  Main  criteria  for  inclusion  were  chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and peritoneal dialysis (Continuous Ambulatory (CAPD), Ambulatory (APD), 
or Continuous cyclical (CCPD)) for 8 weeks or longer and serum phosphorus level > 5.50 mg/dL (1.77 
mmol/L) after two weeks washout from patient’s usual phosphate binder. 
Methods 
i. Study objectives 
Primary objectives in peritoneal dialysis patients were to compare the effects of sevelamer dosed three 
times per day (TID) and calcium acetate dosed TID on serum phosphorus, and to investigate the safety 
and tolerability of sevelamer.  
Secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  the  effects  of  sevelamer  TID  and  calcium  acetate  on  serum 
calcium-phosphorous  product  (CaxPO4),  serum  lipids  (total  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol,  non-HDL 
cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol  and  triglycerides)  and  a  number  of  plasma  biomarkers  (random  blood 
glucose, HbA1C, BSAP, uric acid and CRP). 
ii. Study endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was serum phosphorus level – a target of non-inferiority in comparison 
with calcium acetate was used as the criterion for power calculations. Non-inferiority was defined as a 
difference in the serum phosphorus change between treatment groups of statistically significantly less 
than 0.3 mmol/L. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  change  in  serum  calcium-phosphorus  product  (CaxPO4)  level, 
change in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, 
and  change  in  random  blood  glucose,  glycosylated  haemoglobin  (HbA1C),  bone  specific  alkaline 
phosphatase (BSAP), uric acid, and C-reactive protein (CRP).  
Safety  endpoints  included  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs), 
changes  in  vital  signs,  number  of  hypercalcaemic  episodes  and  changes  in  clinical  laboratory 
evaluations  (serum  phosphorous,  serum  calcium  (albumin-adjusted),  calcium  phosphorous  product, 
intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), lipids, CRP, uric acid, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), 
glucose, HbA1C, FBC, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate).

iii Statistical analysis 
The  primary  endpoint  efficacy  analysis  was  an  assessment  of  non-inferiority  with  respect  to  change 
from  baseline  in  serum  phosphorus  levels  at  Week  12/Final  among  the  Per-Protocol  Set.  A  Full 
Analysis Set (FAS) analysis was performed as a confirmatory analysis.  
The  secondary  endpoint  efficacy  analysis  was  an  assessment  of  the  change  from  baseline  at  Week 
12/Final  in  the  following  parameters  was  analysed:  total  cholesterol,  non-HDL  cholesterol,  LDL 
cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  triglycerides,  calcium  phosphorus  product,  and  plasma  biomarkers 
(CRP, uric acid, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), HbA1C, random blood glucose).  
Comparisons between treatment groups were assessed using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test and 
changes  within  treatment  groups  was  assessed  using  Wilcoxon  Signed  Rank  test.  All  these  analyses 
were  tested  at  the  alpha  =  0.05  (2-tailed)  level  of  significance  unless  otherwise  specified.  p-values 
<0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
All treatment emergent AEs (TAEs)/SAEs and those related to study treatment were summarised and 
tabulated by treatment group for each system organ class and preferred term.  
iv. Study Population 
A  total  of  253  patients  were  screened  for  this  study,  143  of  whom  were  randomised  to  sevelamer 
(n=97) or calcium (n=46) in a 2:1 ratio following the washout period (safety set). The full analysis set 
(FAS)  consisted  of  139  patients  who  received  study  medication  and  had  at  least  one  post-baseline 
serum  phosphorus  assessment  (sevelamer,  n=95;  calcium,  n=44).  Thirty-six  patients  were  excluded 
from the Per Protocol set, which consisted of 103 patients (sevelamer, n=72; calcium, n=31). The main 
reasons for exclusion were poor compliance (<70%) (sevelamer, n=15, calcium, n=10) and less than 3 
weeks on treatment (sevelamer, n=7, calcium, n=3). The study was completed by 76% of patients in 
the  sevelamer  group  (n=74)  and  65%  of  patients  in  the  calcium  group  (n=30).  AEs  were  the  main 
reason  for  premature  withdrawal  from  the  study  (18%  of  sevelamer-treated  patients  and  28%  of 
calcium-treated patients).

failed 
Of the 143 patients in the Safety Set (93 male, 50 female) the mean age was 54.4 years (range 19 to  
91 years). Most patients were Caucasian (90%), with Blacks (2%), and Asians (5%) and Others (3%) 
comprising  the  remainder.  10%  were  smokers,  22%  had  diabetes  and  84%  reported  hypertension  at 
baseline. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups. All patients were on a phosphate-
binder before study entry. Concomitant medication was similar in both groups. 
The  study  was  completed  by  104  patients,  while  39  patients  discontinued  the  study  because  of 
following reasons: adverse event (30), non-compliance (1), withdrew consent (1), other reasons (7). 
Efficacy 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  analysed  in  the  Per  Protocol  Set.    The  mean  serum  phosphorus 
content  at  baseline  was  7.48  mg/dL  (2.40  mmol/L)  in  the  sevelamer  group  and  7.29  mg/dL  
(2.34 mmol/L) in the calcium group. At week 12/final the values were 5.86 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L) in 
the  sevelamer  group  and  5.48  mg/dL  (1.76  mmol/L)  in  the  calcium  group,  which  represented 
statistically  significant  change  (p<0.001)  from  baseline  of  -1.61  mg/dL  (-0.52  mmol/L)  and  - 
1.81  mg/dL  (-0.58  mmol/L),  respectively.  The  difference  in  mean  change  (difference=sevelamer-

calcium)  was 0.197 mg/dL (0.061 mmol/L) with an upper 97.5% confidence bound of 0.741 mg/dL 
(0.237  mmol/L)  thus  establishing  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.929  mg/dL  (0.3  mmol/L).  The  Full 
Analysis Set results were comparable. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  (p<0.001)  from  baseline  to  week  12/final  in  both 
treatment  groups  for  Calcium-Phosphorous  product.  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between the sevelamer and calcium treatment groups at any time point for this variable. 
A statistically significant decrease (p<0.001) from baseline to week 12/final for total-, LDL-, and non-
HDL cholesterol was observed in the sevelamer group, but not in the calcium group (full analysis set). 
These changes were statistically significant between treatment groups (p<0.001).  
For  tryglycerides  there  was  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  terms  of  percentage  change  from 
baseline to week 12/final in both the sevelamer and calcium groups. 
The CHMP concluded that treatment for 12 weeks with sevelamer hydrochloride was non-inferior to 
12 weeks treatment with calcium acetate (calcium) in reducing serum phosphorus levels. The serum 
phosphorus  concentrations  in  both  groups  reached  the  K/DOQI  (Kidney  Disease  Outcomes  Quality 
Initiative guidelines, 2003) target concentration in approximately half the patients. The magnitudes of 
reduction in serum phosphorus were similar to studies conducted in the HD population. 
The mean changes in serum parameters are given in Table 1 below.

Lipid  abnormalities  are  common  in  peritoneal  dialysis  patients.  A  statistically  significant  decrease  
(p<  0.001)  from  baseline  for  total-,  LDL-,  and  non-HDL  cholesterol  was  observed  in  the  sevelamer 
group and may favour additional benefit in these patients. The changes in lipids were not seen in the 
calcium group. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
A  sub-group  analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  performed  separately  within  the  anuric 
and non-anuric patients. 
These results were similar to those seen in total patient sample. Both treatments resulted in statistically 
significant decrease in serum calcium-phosphorus product from baseline to week-12/final.

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Patients received sevelamer for an average of 10.0 weeks (SG 10.3 weeks; CG 9.4 weeks; p=0.236).  
The median percentage compliance in the Safety Set was similar in both groups, 91.3% in the SG and 
88.5% in the CG. In the Safety Set the number of patients evaluated was 97 in the SG and 46 in the 
CG, a 2:1 ratio giving an exposure of approximately 7000 patient days for sevelamer and 3000 patient 
days for calcium.   
Adverse events (AEs) 
A total of 317 treatment–emergent AEs (TAEs) occurred in 108 patients during randomised treatment 
period.  A  similar  percentage  of  patients  experienced  TAEs  in  the  two  treatment  groups:  75  patients 
(77.3%) in the sevelamer group (n=97) experienced 240 adverse events, and 33 patients (71.7%) in the 
calcium  group  (n=46  experienced  77  adverse  events.  The  highest  frequency  of  TAEs  for  both 
treatment  groups  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  with  statistically  significant  higher  number  in  the 
sevelamer group (p = 0.003). Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.

There were 15 episodes of peritonitis reported in patients randomised to the study. Four (4) peritonitis 
episodes were reported as AEs and 11 as SAEs. The sevelamer hydrochloride group experienced 11

episodes  (8  SAEs  and  3AEs).  The  calcium  acetate  group  experienced  2  cases  (2  SAEs).  Two  (2) 
peritonitis episodes occurred during the washout period (1 SAE, 1 AE).  
The  higher  number  of  peritonitis  episodes  in  the  Renagel  treated  group  compared  with  the  calcium 
acetate treated group remains a matter for further surveillance. At present there is no evidence of an 
association  between  Renagel  use  and  peritonitis  or  any  related  factor  in  this  small  group  of  patients 
with peritonitis to fully explain a difference in number of cases between the two arms of the study. For 
that reason the MAH agree in providing prospective data on the occurrence of peritonitis. 
Taking  also  into  account  that  one  of  the  peritonitis  infected  patient,  was  taking  immunosuppressive 
drugs (tacrolimus) and also that 17 % of the patients included in the REN00304 study had previous 
renal transplantation, with at least two patients still on immunosuppressive drugs, the interaction with 
immunosuppressive  medicinal  products  should  be  highlighted.  In  addition  during  the  assessment  no 
final  conclusion  could  be  drawn  to  the  drug-drug  interactions  between  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and 
anti-arrhythmics/anti-epileptics from the results of the REN00304 study. The MAH therefore proposed 
that instructions for intake of these drugs should be given in the SPC and in the Package Leaflet. 
Serious adverse events(SAEs) and deaths 
During the study 31 SAEs occurred in 24 patients; 26 SAEs for 19 patients (19.6%) in the sevelamer 
group  and  5  SAEs  for  5  patients  (10.9%)  in  the  calcium  group.  The  most  frequently  occurring 
treatment-emergent SAE was peritonitis (8 events in 8 patients in the sevelamer group and 2 events in 
2 patients in the calcium group). Six AEs of severe intensity occurred in 2 patients in the sevelamer 
group and 6 events occurring in 3 patients in the calcium group were considered related to study drug. 
Two  patients  died  during  the  study.  Both  deaths  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
investigator.  One  patient  in  the  calcium  group  died  in  a  road  traffic  accident  11  days  after  starting 
study drug. One patient in the sevelamer group died of unknown reason 6 weeks after starting study 
drug.  An autopsy was not performed and the cause of death remained unknown. Cardiac arrest was 
suspected. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  number  of  adverse  events  and  the  number  of  patients  who  had  AEs 
differ  between  the  study  groups.  AEs  which  were  considered  treatment  related  differ  between  the 
groups.  A  higher  percentage  of  patients  on  sevelamer  experienced  gastrointestinal  treatment-related 
events, which is consistent with results from previous studies with sevelamer. However, in this study 
the difference did not reach statistical significance.  
Laboratory findings 
There was a significant decrease from baseline in bicarbonate level with sevelamer (from 22.1 mmol/L 
at baseline to 21.3 mmol/L at 12 weeks; p=0.003) and a significant difference in mean change between 
treatment  groups  (p=0.008).  However,  the  change  in  bicarbonate  in  the  sevelamer  group  was  not 
considered  to  be  clinically  significant  and  metabolic  acidosis  was  reported  in  just  one  sevelamer 
treated patient. The worsening of metabolic acidosis is already mentioned in the SPC section 4.4 for 
haemodialysis  patients.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  if  there  was  a  need  for  additional  risk 
minimisation measures for the peritoneal dialysis patients. 
Hypercalcaemia (i.e. albumin-adjusted serum calcium ≥ 11.0 mg/dL) was experienced by significant 
more patients in the calcium group compared with the sevelamer group (p=0.001). Patients on calcium 
had  a  higher  frequency  of  hypercalcaemia,  increased  blood  calcium,  and  increased  calcium 
phosphorus product .These events may be risk factors for development of tissue calcifications.  
Safety in special populations 
A  sub-group  analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  performed  separately  within  the  anuric  
(N 27) and non-anuric (N 112) patients. The safety results were similar to those seen in total patient 
sample.

There  were  not  data  in  this  clinical  trial  in  pregnant  or  lactating  women,  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment  or  cardiac  impairment,  immunocompromised  patients  and  populations  with  genetic 
polymorphism will be provided if applicable. The MAH is committing to provide a safety summary of 
the  complete  clinical  trials  and  post  authorisation  data  for  Renagel  to  date  in  the  haemodialysis  and 
peritoneal dialysis indications.

Pharmacovigilance

Risk Management Plan 
A  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  was  not  submitted  with  the  initial  variation  application  but  it  was 
requested  with  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  in  November  2006.  The  MAH  has  then 
provided a Risk Management Plan which was assessed. 
The  current  Renagel  SPC  reflects  this  established  safety  profile  and  covers  all  important  risks 
identified until now. The important unidentified potential risks captured as adverse effects which will 
be additionally observed in patients treated with Renagel can be evaluated in the context of established 
Pharmacovigilance  practice.  The  main  new  issues  identified  are  relevant  to  reported  cases  of 
peritonitis and as well as the functioning of the current surveillance systems. 
In the revised RMP the MAH should provide a summary table of planned pharmacovigilance actions 
for each safety concern. Where no action beyond routine pharmacovigilance is planned, it should be 
fully justified. The evaluation of the need for risk minimisation activities should list all safety concerns 
with discussions whether routine (i.e. changes to the Product Information) risk minimisation activities 
activities  
will 
(e.g. educational material or training programmes for prescribers, pharmacists and patients, restricted 
access programmes) will be required.

Identified and potential risks including gastrointestinal ADRs such as intestinal obstruction, and ileus, 
vitamin deficiency, increased serum chloride levels, worsening of acidosis, hypothyroidism should be 
discussed in the revised RMP.  Whether these risks are similar in HD and PD patients should also be 
discussed. 
In  the  updated  RMP  requested  by  the  CHMP  the  MAH  has  agreed  to  revise  the  Pharmacovigilance 
Plan and re-evaluate the Need for Risk Minimisation Activities. 
More  specifically  there  will  be  increased  monitoring  of  peritonitis  and  provision  of  additional 
information material for patients and health care professionals including risk factors and precautions 
against infection. The MAH will review the collected data from the prospective registry and they will 
update  the  RMP  based  on  the  review.  In  addition  there  will  be  evaluation  of  the  need  for  risk 
minimisation activities and any planned pharmacovigilance actions for any safety concerns.  
The  details  of  important  identified  and  potential  risks  including  gastrointestinal  ADRs  such  as 
intestinal  obstruction,  and  ileus,  vitamin  deficiency,  increased  serum  chloride  levels,  worsening  of 
acidosis, hypothyroidism will be discussed including clarification on whether these risks are similar in 
HD and PD patients which will also be submitted. 
The  discussion  on  co-morbidities  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  heart  failure,  and 
chronic lung diseases will be added and as well as the epidemiology of identified or potential risks in 
the target population will be studied.  
The  ongoing  safety  concerns  will  be  closely  monitored  and  information  on  special  patient  groups, 
important  missing  information,  and  the  impact  of  identified  and  potential  risk  of  Renagel  will  be 
added. In addition the present off-label use will be estimated and provided.

Overall Scientific Discussion and Benefit/Risk Assessment 
In  kidney  failure  patients,  when  GFR  drops  below  25%  of  normal,  compensatory  increases  in  renal 
excretion  are  no  longer  sufficient  to  maintain  normal  serum  phosphorus  level.  Control  of  serum 
phosphorus  is  critical  to  prevent  metastatic  calcification,  a  condition  where  calcium  and  phosphate 
precipitate  into  soft  tissues,  often  in  association  with  a  high  calcium  phosphorus  product.  Elevated 
serum  phosphorus  and  calcium  phosphorus  product  are  associated  with  increased  risk  of  death  in 
dialysis patients. 
Patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis are  usually placed on phosphorus-restricted diets in 
attempt  to  control  serum  phosphorus  levels.  Dietary  phosphorus  restriction  is  usually  insufficient  to 
control serum phosphorus levels, and phosphate binders are also used to decrease absorption of dietary 
phosphorus.  Sevelamer  (Renagel)  is  a  non  absorbable  phosphate-binding  polymer,  approved  for  the 
control of serum phosphorus in adult patients on haemodialysis. 
The MAH has now conducted one clinical study, protocol REN00304 in peritoneal dialysis patients. 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride 
compared with calcium acetate in peritoneal dialysis patients. 
Regarding the efficacy, it is concluded that treatment for 12 weeks with sevelamer hydrochloride was 
non-inferior  to  the  12-week  treatment  with  calcium  acetate  (calcium)  in  reducing  serum  phosphorus 
levels.  The  serum  phosphorus  concentrations  in  both  groups  reached  the  K/DOQI  guideline  target 
concentration  in  approximately  half  the  patients.  The  magnitudes  of  reduction  in  serum  phosphorus 
were similar to studies conducted in the HD population. 
Regarding  the  safety  of  the  product,  the  clinical  trial  REN00304  conducted  with  Renagel  in  the  PD 
population has shown that the product is well tolerated in general in this population. The safety profile 
of  Renagel  in  this  new  population  is  consistent  with  patients’  underlying  renal  disease  and  with  the 
known safety profile for Renagel. No newly important and potential risks have been identified in this 
population. Although a higher percentage of patients on sevelamer experienced gastrointestinal events, 
that  is  consistent  with  results  from  previous  studies  with  the  product.  The  higher  prevalence  of 
peritonitis  in  the  Renagel  treated  group  compared  with  the  calcium-acetate  treated  group  and 
compared with reported prevalence of peritonitis episodes in the literature remains a matter for further 
surveillance.  At  present  there  is  no  evidence  of  an  association  between  Renagel  use  and  peritonitis. 
Therefore, the MAH has proposed modifications to the original risk minimization strategy to follow 
up the reported cases by the collection of additional information at sites and provide it in the PSURs 
every six months for the period of two years after approval of this variation. 
Because failure of a transplant kidney is an increasing reason for end-stage renal disease necessitating 
dialysis,  the  CHMP  proposed  that  the  interactions  with  tacrolimus  should  also  be  indicated  in  the 
Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC).  In  addition,  cyclosporine  A, 
tacrolimus  and 
mycophenolate  mofetil  should  be  mentioned  also  in  the  Package  Leaflet  because  up  to  50  %  of 
patients still  continue to take immunosuppressive drugs to  maintain residual renal function when on 
dialysis. 
The  CHMP  suggested  that  drug-drug  interactions  between  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  anti-
arrhythmics/anti-epileptics  could  not  be  accurately  judged  from  the  results  of  the  REN00304  study. 
Therefore instructions for intake of these drugs should be given in the SPC and in the Package Leaflet. 
The Risk Management Plan will be revised and re-submitted to the CHMP for evaluation. The MAH 
has accepted this commitment. 
The CHMP concluded that the overall benefit-risk is favourable for the control of hyperphosphatemia 
in adult patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and agreed to the extension of the indication of Renagel 
as applied by the MAH

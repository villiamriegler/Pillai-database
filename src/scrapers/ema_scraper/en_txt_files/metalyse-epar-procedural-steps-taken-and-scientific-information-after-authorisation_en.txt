SmPC, Annex 
To update section 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC to introduce 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
II, Labelling 
changes in the handling instruction; PL is updated 
and PL 
accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement changes in the QRD template implemented; PI 
for both strengths in the SmPC and PL combined. Minor 
changes through the PI. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In this variation the MAH proposed the update of the 
the SmPC in order to include: a recommendation to 
administer Metalyse with caution in elderly patients 
(> 75 years); an amendment of the existing 
contraindication on concomitant use of Metalyse in 
patients on oral anticoagulants; a warning regarding 
transfer to a coronary intervention capable facility for 
adjunctive PCI and consequent clarification of 
existing warning on primary PCI; formatting/editorial 
changes in section "Fertility, Pregnancy and 
Lactation" and "Clinical Pharmacokinetics"; and 
results from the STREAM study. The MAH took also 
Metalyse product information to include a recommendation 
to administer Metalyse with caution in elderly patients (> 
75 years); an amendment of the existing contraindication 
on concomitant use of Metalyse in patients on blood 
thinning drugs; a warning regarding need to transfer 
patients to a facility capable of ensuring appropriate 
treatment and diagnosis if they have received Metalyse as 
coronary intervention. The MAH included also results from 
the STREAM study which evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of a pharmaco-invasive strategy versus a strategy of 
standard primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

gentamycin for SPC and PL is endorsed by the CHMP. The 
CHMP view is that the new wording will increase the safe 
use of Metalyse.  
As to the adoption of several changes according to the SPC 
Guideline, the process of formal changing of former terms 
to MedDRA terms (Clinical Overview, 2.5.5.2.1) the criteria 
for redefinition of frequency categories for all labelled 
adverse reactions described in the Clinical Overview 
summarised different low level terms under one preferred 
term, e.g. conjunctival and ocularr haemorrhage under eye 
haemorrhage, described under section 2.5.5.2.3 are also 
endorsed.  
In addition to the changes resulting from the above 
mentioned measures, all adverse reactions have been 
shifted into a table, in accordance with the SPC Guideline. 
All proposed changes to the SPC are endorsed. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) has also been amended.

The MAH has updated sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC in 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
II, Labelling 
order to include information on the outcome and design of 
and PL 
the ASSENT-4 PCI study. The outcome of ASSENT-4 PCI 
was unfavorable with regards to primary endpoint (death, 
cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure) for the 
facilitated (+Tenecteplase) PCI treatment in comparison to 
standard PCI treatment. 
The following text was added to Section 4.4: 
"Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
If primary PCI is scheduled according to the current 
relevant treatment guidelines, Metalyse as administered in 
the ASSENT-4 PCI study (see section 5.1) should not be 
given."

and to Section 5.5: 
The ASSENT-4 PCI study was designed to show if in 4000 
patients with large myocardial infarctions pre-treatment 
with full dose tenecteplase and concomitant single bolus of 
up to 4,000 IU unfractionated heparin administered prior to 
primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) to be 
performed within 60 to 180 minutes leads to better 
outcomes than primary PCI alone. The trial was 
prematurely terminated with 1667 randomised patients due 
to a numerically higher mortality in the facilitated PCI 
group receiving tenecteplase. The occurrence of the 
primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic 
shock or congestive heart failure within 90 days, was 
significantly higher in the group receiving the exploratory 
regimen of tenecteplase followed by routine immediate PCI: 
18.6% (151/810) compared to 13.4% (110/819) in the PCI 
only group, p=0.0045. This significant difference between 
the groups for the primary endpoint at 90 days was already 
present in-hospital and at 30 days.  
Numerically all of the components of the clinical composite 
endpoint were in favour of the PCI only regimen: death: 
6.7% vs. 4.9% p=0.14; cardiogenic shock: 6.3% vs. 4.8% 
p=0.19; congestive heart failure: 12.0% vs. 9.2% p=0.06 
respectively. The secondary endpoints re-infarction and 
repeat target vessel revascularisation were significantly 
increased in the

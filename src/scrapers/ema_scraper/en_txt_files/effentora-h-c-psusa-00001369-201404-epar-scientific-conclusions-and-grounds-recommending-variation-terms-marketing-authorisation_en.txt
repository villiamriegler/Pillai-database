- Withdrawal syndrome: 
For Effentora/Actiq there have been 54 cases of chills, including 36 withdrawal syndrome reported 
simultaneously; 26 reports of pyrexia (20 for Actiq) and in some of them (number unspecified) 
withdrawal syndrome reported simultaneously; 93 cases of tremor and 54 withdrawal reported 
simultaneously; 83 cases of insomnia and 37 withdrawal reported simultaneously and 46 cases of 
agitation and 20 withdrawal syndrome reported simultaneously. For Instanyl there have been 12 cases 
of withdrawal symptom. For Pecfent there have been 2 cases and for Abstral 3 cases reported. 
For those products where it is not yet listed, withdrawal symptom should be added as an adverse 
reaction in section 4.8 of the product information with a frequency unknown. In addition 
recommendations should be added in section 4.2 of the SmPC to discontinue treatment if the patient 
no longer experiences breakthrough pain episodes and to closely monitor patients if discontinuation of 
all opioid therapy is required in order to manage the risk of abrupt withdrawal effects. A warning 
should also be included in section 4.5 of the SmPC regarding the concomitant use of partial opioid 
agonist/antagonist (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine) that may induce withdrawal 
symptoms in opioid-dependent patients. 
- Pyrexia: 
Pyrexia is already listed for Instanyl, Pecfent and Breakyl. For Effentora/Actiq there have been 65 
reports  of pyrexia. 
For those products where it is not yet listed, pyrexia should be added as an adverse reaction in section 
4.8 of the product information with a frequency unknown 
- Insomnia: 
Insomnia is already listed for Effentora, Instanyl, Breakyl and Abstral. There have been 83 cases and 
37 cases of withdrawal symptoms reported simultaneously for Effentora/Actiq.  
Insomnia should be added as an adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency 
unknown for those products where it is not yet listed. 
- Breast-feeding: 
Data regarding the use of fentanyl in breastfeeding women is limited. Fentanyl is present in the breast 
milk (6.4 µg/l) after transcutaneous administration (transdermal patch, 100 µg/h); and after iv 
administration; however the concentration of fentanyl in breast milk is not known more than 24 hours 
after administration.No pharmacokinetic data regarding breast milk is available after transmucosal 
fentanyl exposure. Therefore, without data on pharmacokinetic of fentanyl transfer to human breast 
milk after transmucosal fentanyl exposure, the washout period required to abstain from breastfeeding 
following administration of these products cannot be determined accurately. 
Taking into account the pharmacological profile of fentanyl with risk of sedation and respiratory 
depression in case of exposure through breast milk for the neonate, it was agreed to increase the 
duration of the recommended washout period currently 48 hours, based on an effective plasma half-life 
of 3-7h, to 5 days in section 4.6 of the SmPC, based on a terminal elimination half-life of 22 hours and 
the fact that fentanyl would be expected to have cleared from the plasma within 5 days. 
- Miosis: 
Based on the available evidence in literature, miosis is a well-established and well-known effect of all 
μ-opioids. Cumulatively, there have been 16 cases of miosis reported with Effentora, 2 cases with 
Pecfent and one case with Abstral. Based on this evidence it is recommended that miosis is listed in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC as a secondary pharmacological effect. The MAHs should continue to monitor 
this signal. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding fentanyl (transmucosal route of administration), the

PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for fentanyl (transmucosal route of administration) the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fentanyl 
(transmucosal route of administration) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

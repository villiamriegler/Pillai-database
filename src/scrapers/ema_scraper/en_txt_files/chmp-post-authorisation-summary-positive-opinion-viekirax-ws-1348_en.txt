The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG. 
The CHMP adopted a change to an existing contraindication as follows:2 
“Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 5.2).” 
For information, the full contraindications for Viekirax will be as follows:

Use of ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined 
oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see section 4.4 and 4.5). 
Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated 
plasma levels are associated with serious events must not be co-administered with Viekirax (see 
section 4.5). Examples are provided below. 
CYP3A4 substrates: 
• 
• 
•

inhibitors are provided below.

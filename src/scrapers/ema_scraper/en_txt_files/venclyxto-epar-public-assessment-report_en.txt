2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a progressive haematologic disease characterized by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs, 
and diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood for the 
duration of at least 3 months. It is the most common form of adult leukaemia in the Western world, 
representing about 30% of leukaemias, with higher incidences in North America and Europe than in 
Asia, with an incidence of 4 per 100,000 persons per year. In Europe, the age-standardised CLL 
incidence rate from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink was 6.2/100,000 person 
years. The median age of diagnosis in the EU is 72 years and only 10% of patients are less than 55 
years old. The current WHO classification system recognizes and groups CLL and small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL) as the same biological entity, with CLL clinically manifesting primarily in bone marrow 
and peripheral blood, and SLL primarily manifesting in the lymph nodes.  
Current treatments for CLL are not curative. Fewer patients obtain responses with each subsequent 
regimen, and subjects become increasingly resistant to available therapy. Patients who relapse after a 
disease-free period of over 1 year (2-3 years for chemoimmunotherapy) are considered treatment 
sensitive and may be candidates for treatment reinitiation. Patients who relapse after a shorter 
interval, or are refractory to first-line treatment, present a more challenging group, particularly those 
who are older, have comorbid conditions, and/or harbor high-risk cytogenic abnormalities. A 
retrospective analysis of patients in the German CLL8 trial found that overall survival after the start of 
salvage treatment among patients whose disease had progressed within 2 years after the end of 
chemoimmunotherapy was about 2 years, comparable to that of truly refractory patients. In the 
EUROCARE-5 registry, the survival rate for patients with CLL at 5 years post diagnosis was 69.0%. 
Patients with a genetic mutation with 17p del or a mutation of the tumour suppressor gene TP53 have 
a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS) of 2 to 5 years. Approximately 5% to 10% of 
patients with early stage CLL have a 17p del and/or TP53 mutation; this rate increases with treatment 
lines up to 40% in advanced refractory CLL. Approximately 80% of CLL patients with a 17p del also 
have a mutation in TP53; sole TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p del have been reported to occur 
in approximately 4% to 5% of patients. 
The monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, is currently approved in the EU in the treatment of CLL in the 
relapsed or refractory setting as a single agent. The combination of the monoclonal antibody rituximab 
with chemotherapy (eg, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) (FCR regimen) is approved in the EU for 
use in this setting. Marketing authorization for alemtuzumab, which had been indicated for the 
treatment of CLL in patients for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate, was 
withdrawn in the EU in August 2012. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 8/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment option with the 
potential to cure CLL; however most patients are not fit for HSCT and the benefits must be weighed 
against the risks for each patient. Historically, the prognosis for 17p del CLL patients has been poor 
due to the limited efficacy of immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy-based regimens.  A median 
progression free survival (PFS) of 14 months has been reported in first-line 17p deletion patients and 6 
to 7 months in relapsed/refractory (R/R) 17p del patients; median OS was approximately 24 months. 
Recent introduction of targeted therapy, such as BCR inhibitors (BCRi), has improved the treatment 
options for CLL patients with the 17p del or TP53 mutation.  Ibrutinib was associated with independent 
review committee (IRC) assessed objective remission rate (ORR) of 48% to 65% (investigator 
assessed ORR of 83% to 86%) and idelalisib/rituximab was associated with IRC assessed ORR of 85%. 
In 2014, Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and Zydelig (idelalisib) in combination with rituximab were approved for 
treatment of CLL patients that have received at least one prior therapy and first-line treatment in the 
presence of 17p del or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.  
The recently updated European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidance reflects these approvals 
and recommends that patients with 17p del or TP53 mutation are treated with B-cell receptor inhibitors  
(BCRi), i.e. ibrutinib; idelalisib + rituximab) in front-line and R/R settings.   
Venclyxto (INN: Venetoclax also referred to as ABT-199 and GDC-0199) is a novel, orally bioavailable, 
small-molecule B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family inhibitor in the biarylacylsulfonamide chemical class.  
Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are associated with tumour initiation, disease progression, and 
chemotherapy resistance.  Overexpression of Bcl-2 is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of some 
lymphoid malignancies; antagonism of the action of these proteins may enhance response to therapy 
and overcome resistance, and thus, these proteins are compelling targets for anti-tumour therapy. 
Aberrant expression of Bcl-2 is common in CLL and CLL cells typically have a fundamental reliance on 
Bcl-2 for survival.  Moreover, in CLL and other tumour types or subpopulations, Bcl-2 is highly 
associated with or pre-bound to pro-death proteins such as Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell 
death), a status described as "primed for death." In this state, the cells may be driven into apoptosis 
by treatment with a Bcl-2 inhibitor. 
Venetoclax acts downstream in the B-cell receptor signaling cascade, and is also expected to maintain 
activity in the presence of identified mutations (see figure below).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of venetoclax is 4-(4-{[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-
yl]methyl}piperazin-1-yl)-N-({3-nitro-4-[(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylmethyl)amino]phenyl}sulfonyl)-2-
(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-5-yloxy)benzamide corresponding to the molecular formula C45H50ClN7O7S. 
It has a relative molecular mass of 868.44 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 2): 
Figure 2: Structure of venetoclax 
Venetoclax is a light yellow to yellow to dark yellow non-hygroscopic powder with a melting point of 
about 138 ºC onset. Its solubility in aqueous media is very low and it is very slightly soluble in 1% 
polysorbate 80 (w/v aq.). The apparent permeability is in the low to moderate range. The pKa values 
are 3.4 and 10.3 for the sulfonamide and piperazine groups respectively and the partition coefficient is 
5.5. Venetoclax has a non-chiral molecular structure.   
Polymorphism has been observed for venetoclax. Multiple crystal forms have been discovered in solid 
form screening studies.  The thermodynamically stable form is consistently manufactured and does not 
change upon storage. 
The Applicant has performed comparative structural analysis to show that venetoclax is to be regarded 
as a new active substance (NAS) in itself and that it is not a salt, complex, derivative or isomer (nor 
mixture of isomers) of a previously authorised substance. Venetoclax has not been previously 
authorised in any medicinal product in the EU. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Venetoclax is synthesized in four main stages, using four well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. Each manufacturing stage is divided into unit operations and each unit 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 11/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
operation may have one or more process steps to produce the crystalline form selected for 
manufacture.   Several manufacturing sites are involved in the manufacture of the active substance. 
Where common intermediates are manufactured by different sites, identical synthetic route and 
materials (catalyst, reagents and solvents) are used.  
A process step or a sequence of process steps may be repeated and it is confirmed that the 
reprocessed material must meet the specification. The proposed reprocessing is considered acceptable. 
A  systematic approach to manufacturing process development and control strategy has been taken 
and the following key elements were addressed throughout development: identification of the potential 
venetoclax critical quality attributes that are linked to the finished product quality target product 
profile; identification through prior knowledge, experimentation and risk assessment of the material 
attributes, process parameters, and critical unit operations that can impact the venetoclax active 
substance CQAs; use of process understanding in combination with quality risk management to 
establish the active substance control strategy. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DoE) studies and kinetic 
modelling, but no design space has been claimed. Critical and non-critical process parameters have 
been described. A thorough understanding of the formation and fate of impurities in venetoclax 
process was obtained by a combination of spiking and purging studies and process stress studies. The 
obtained knowledge was used to establish impurity acceptance criteria for the starting materials and 
isolated intermediates, which in combination with in process controls and the established processing 
ranges ensure the quality of venetoclax active substance. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents are considered acceptable.  A detailed control strategy, which identifies the 
primary control points (i.e. starting material and API intermediate controls, in-process controls, and 
process parameters) throughout the manufacturing, has been established and justified. The control 
strategy is considered satisfactory. 
Detailed information on the development of the commercial manufacturing process has been provided. 
Venetoclax is currently manufactured by the four-stage process. The proposed commercial process has 
been used for stability and validation batches and most clinical studies. Earlier processes have been 
used in non-clinical, first-in-human studies, and early clinical batches.  The differences of these earlier 
processes compared to the commercial process have been described. Changes introduced have been 
presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
Process validation has been completed and shows that the manufacturing process can perform 
effectively and reproducibly to obtain venetoclax meeting its predetermined specifications and quality 
attributes. 
The Venetoclax crystalline form selected for manufacture has been characterised by MS,  FT-IR, 1H 
NMR, 13C NMR, XRPD, DSC, TGA, laser diffraction for particle size distribution, optical microscopy, 
dynamic vapour sorption  (DVS)  and UV/VIS. The characterisation of the active substance and its 
impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential 
and actual impurities were well discussed, with regards to their origin, and characterised. The potential 
presence of genotoxic and carcinogenic impurities has been satisfactorily addressed and where 
relevant adequate limits for these impurities have been included in the control strategy. 
The active substance is packaged in bags placed in light protective drums used for storage/shipping of 
the active substance. The primary packaging complies with Ph. Eur. requirements and EC 10/2011 as 
amended.

(Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), crystal form (XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC, GC MS), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph. 
Eur.). The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes 
(CQA). 
Impurities present at higher level than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
 The omission in the specification of certain tests has been adequately justified. Solvents used in the 
process prior to stage 4 and certain reagents have been shown to be acceptably cleared in venetoclax. 
The catalyst has not been detected in batch analysis data and, at a daily dose of 400 mg, does not 
exceed the permissible daily exposure considered acceptable by ICH Q3D. Therefore, it is considered 
justified that these parameters are not included in the specification.  
The genotoxic or potentially genotoxic impurities, including genotoxic impurity precursors and 
carcinogenic impurities that could be formed or introduced during the venetoclax manufacturing 
process are controlled through material attributes and/or by controls in compliance with the options 
defined in the ICH M7.  
Moreover, a number of active substance quality attributes considered as non-critical are not included in 
the specification and it is considered acceptable.   
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The stability indicating nature of the 
methods for assay and impurities was demonstrated by means of forced degradation studies. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data are provided for twenty eight venetoclax batches manufactured by the commercial 
process at production scale and above. Eight of the batches were manufactured at the commercial 
manufacturing site. Most of the batches have been used for clinical purposes.  In addition, batch 
results from batches manufactured by earlier processes have been provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided for five production scale or greater than production scale batches of active 
substance in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions at 30 
ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH. Photostability 
testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one primary batch. Stability results at 
refrigerated conditions (5 ºC) and at elevated temperatures (50 ºC / 75% RH and 60 ºC / 75% RH) 
were also provided for the three primary batches. In addition, process validation batches manufactured 
at the proposed manufacturing site have been placed on stability but results are not available yet. 
Although the formal stability studies have not been performed according to the storage conditions 
proposed by ICH Q1A (R2), as higher humidity of 75% is used instead of 65%, this is acceptable as no 
decomposition is observed due to humidity. 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, water content, impurities and crystal form 
(XRPD). At some storage conditions microbiological quality and water activity are also monitored.    
Some changes were made to the analytical methods during stability studies. The changes to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 13/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analytical test methods did not affect the interpretation of the stability results. Changes have been 
described and the validation summaries for the old methods have been provided. 
No significant change in any of the parameters tested has been observed during the formal stability 
studies and no trends are seen. All tested parameters were within the specifications. No difference in 
trends is seen between the results of the primary stability batches and the stability batches 
manufactured at the proposed commercial site.  
Venetoclax exhibits sensitivity to light.  Changes were not seen in the long term and accelerated 
stability studies where venetoclax was packaged in plastic bags and placed in the stability chamber.  
The substance in the plastic bags will however be stored in outer plastic drums to ensure protection 
from light. 
From stress studies it was found that venetoclax is sensitive to oxidation and slightly sensitive to UV 
radiation, heat, heat and moisture and acid treatment. Although stress studies under basic conditions 
were not performed, early physicochemical properties studies on venetoclax demonstrated that the 
active substance is stable under alkaline conditions.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months at the proposed 
storage conditions of NMT 30 ºC in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product comes in three strengths of venetoclax (10 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) as immediate 
release film-coated tablets.  The 10 mg tablet is round (6.0 mm in diameter), biconvex and pale yellow 
and bears the markings “V” on one side and “10” on the other. The 50 mg tablet is oblong (14.0 x 8.0 
mm), biconvex, beige and bears the markings “V” on one side and “50” on the other. The 100 mg 
tablet is oblong (17.2 x 9.5 mm), biconvex, pale yellow and bears the markings “V” on one side and 
“100” on the other.  
The three strengths are dose proportional  The composition of the venetoclax tablets includes 
venetoclax, copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, polysorbate 80, sodium stearyl fumarate, and calcium 
phosphate dibasic.  The composition of the venetoclax film coating includes polyethylene glycol, talc, 
polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide and either iron oxide yellow (for the 10 mg and 100 rng tablet) or 
iron oxide yellow, red and black (for the 50 mg tablet). 
Venetoclax active substance is an ionisable compound with two pKa values of physiological importance 
(3.4, acidic sulfonamide and 10.3, basic piperazine). The active substance has very poor aqueous 
solubility. Because of the very low solubility characteristics, a solid dispersion approach in copovidone 
(manufacturing an intermediate), is employed to increase the apparent aqueous solubility and 
bioavailability of venetoclax. The good solubility and compatibility of venetoclax in copovidone was 
confirmed by DSC studies. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards except for the film coatings, although they are both composed of a mixture of compendial 
components. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 14/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients is inferred from the stability studies of 
venetoclax tablets in blisters. 
During formulation development, focus was set on three key requirements for the intermediate the 
finished tablets: bioavailability, storage stability and manufacturability.  
The formulation used in most clinical studies or bioavailability studies is the commercial formulation 
and has not changed throughout the clinical development except for a small number of batches used in 
early clinical studies which were not coated (50 mg and 100 mg). Bioequivalence was shown between 
the coated and uncoated tablets.  
A dissolution method has been developed for quality control (QC) during release and stability testing of 
the finished product. The pH of the dissolution method was fixed at a biorelevant pH 6.8 based on the 
expectation of substantial drug absorption occurring in the small intestine and the low pH-independent 
solubility observed at pH 4 and above. The anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was chosen for use in 
the dissolution medium as it solubilised venetoclax at intestinal pH without affecting its release 
mechanism. An antifoaming agent was necessary to add immediately before testing. The proposed 
routine dissolution method operates under sink conditions. The discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method has been demonstrated. The three strengths of tablets have different dissolution profiles as 
the release is governed by erosion however available clinical bioavailability data did not indicate a 
relevant difference in bioavailability between the different tablet strengths.  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. A systematic approach 
has been taken to develop the tablet formulation, manufacturing process and control strategy. 
Finished product CQAs were identified based on the quality target product profile (QTPP). Taking into 
account the physicochemical characteristics of the active substance, the formulation and 
manufacturing process were developed to achieve desired finished product quality attributes (CQAs). 
The development was based on prior knowledge and experience of similar products, published 
literature, design of experiments (DoE) and material characterisation. 
An initial risk assessment was performed when the commercial formulation was identified. Critical 
process parameters (CPP) were identified. The initial risks were assigned based on process 
understanding gained from approved and marketed products and early development activities. Based 
on the risks identified, a development plan was devised to systematically generate appropriate data 
and to identify the manufacturing operating ranges and in-process controls (IPCs).  The justification of 
the critical process parameters (CPP), manufacturing operating ranges and IPCs for the tablets 
manufacturing processes have been adequately discussed. As the development proceeded, the risk 
assessment was re-evaluated and updated.  In the final risk assessment low residual risks were rated 
for all parameters. The rationales for the assigned risks have been justified. No design space was 
proposed. The control strategy is considered satisfactory. 
The development and commercial finished product manufacturing sites are described. Dissolution data 
showed that the quality of the tablets manufactured at different sites is comparable. 
The bulk package for venetoclax tablets is  described. Bulk stability data have been submitted for two 
batches  of  the  respective  strengths,  manufactured  at  the  commercial  site,  placed  in  the  mentioned 
package. Results supported the approved bulk holding time. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PCTFE aluminium foil blisters. The material complies with EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for venetoclax, includes manufacture of the intermediate, milling, blending, 
tableting, coating and packaging.  Different manufacturing sites are involved. The process is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process as the Applicant has significant prior knowledge of 
the manufacture of this type of product and has gained significant knowledge of the product during 
development. 
A  control  strategy  for  the  intermediate  venetoclax  tablets  has  been  provided.  Critical  process 
parameters  and  in-process  controls  for  the  venetoclax  intermediate  and  tablets  are  described.  CPPs 
and IPCs for the intermediate were established during manufacturing process development to ensure a 
homogeneous  blend  and  to  warrant  suitable  dissolution  of  the  product.  Also,  an  acceptable  level  of 
degradation products is aimed at. For the film coated tablets, CPPs and IPCs have been established to 
ensure the CQAs assay, uniformity of dosage units and appearance. The target and proven acceptable 
ranges  (PAR)  are  specified  for  each  CPP.  The  CPPs  and  IPCs  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process. 
The analytical methods used in the control of the intermediate have been described and validated. 
Justification of the specification is based on development data, batch release data, stability data, 
compendial requirements, and active substance testing. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. Formal validation will be performed post-approval. The process validation 
scheme has been provided and includes three consecutive production scale batches of the intermediate 
and three consecutive production scale batches per strength of the tablets and is considered 
acceptable. 
Product specification 
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description 
(visual), identification (HPLC-RT and HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and degradation products (HPLC-UV).  
For dissolution, different criteria are proposed for the three strengths (due to the differences in 
geometry and total mass) and comprise three-point limits which are justified by the dissolution 
mechanism (erosion). The limits are based on the batch analysis and stability data obtained on several 
batches. Impurities present at higher level than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were 
qualified by toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Omission of microbiological limits, elemental impurities, crystallinity, residual solvents and genotoxic 
impurities has been sufficiently justified.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches per strength manufactured at 
the proposed commercial site according to the proposed manufacturing process confirming its 
consistency and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Sufficient production scale stability data were provided for batches manufactured at the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site for all three strengths. Stability data were provided for three pilot scale 
primary batches of the finished product per strength manufactured at the development site. The 
batches manufactured at the development site and at the proposed commercial manufacturer were 
respectively stored under long term conditions for up to 24 or 12 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH. The batches are representative to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, crystal form and water 
content. Additionally, microbiological quality and water activity were tested initially, after 6 months of 
accelerated storage and annually in the long term studies.  Some changes were made to the analytical 
methods during stability studies. The changes to the analytical test methods did not affect the 
interpretation of the stability results. Changes have been described and the validation summaries for 
the old methods have been provided. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
A few out of specification results in the primary stability batches have been described and acceptably 
explained. These out of specification results are not considered relevant for the assignment of the shelf 
life and storage condition as the packaging process was improved throughout development. All stability 
results for the batches manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site met the proposed 
acceptance criteria.  
In addition, one primary batch per strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.  No significant changes were observed 
and therefore, the tablets are not considered to be light sensitive. 
Moreover, various stressed studies have also been performed on tablets including temperature 
excursions (5 ºC, 50 ºC/ 75% RH, 60 ºC / 75% RH), thermal cycling (-20 ºC for 72 hours and then 
50ºC/75% RH for 72 hours, cycled three times) and open dish studies. From the results it can be 
concluded that the product is sensitive to high humidity and temperature conditions when outside its 
packaging. 
Additionally, stability data were provided for two production scale batches of the intermediate stored 
under long term conditions. The batches are representative of those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. All results are within the specifications.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed holding time of 12 months for venetoclax intermediate 
under the specified storage conditions is acceptable. The applicant’s proposal to define the start of 
shelf life for the finished product as the date when venetoclax intermediate is combined with excipients 
was accepted as well.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Venetoclax active substance, which is synthesized as a crystalline material, has very low solubility in 
aqueous media at physiologically relevant pH. To obtain satisfactory bioavailability of the finished 
product, the substance is formulated as an intermediate. The dissolution of venetoclax is also

considered critical and it is important that the water content of the tablets is adequately controlled and 
that the package satisfactorily protects the product in this respect.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development 
of the active substance and finished product and their manufacturing process. However, no design 
spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance, or for the finished product.  
The results of tests carried out, indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A series of in vitro and in vivo investigations have been conducted in order to characterise the primary 
pharmacology of Venetoclax. In vitro tests aimed at biochemical and cellular pharmacological 
characterisation of venetoclax.   In vivo, proof-of-concept of venetoclax monotherapy administered at 
a single dose or at repetitive doses was evaluated. Subcutaneous as well as systemic xenograft models 
were subjected to venetoclax single-agent therapy.  
The set of toxicology studies was designed to support the development of venetoclax for the target 
indication based on ICH S9 and for future oncology indications outside of the scope of advanced cancer 
and falling under the ICH M3 (R2).  Conduct of an in vivo micronucleus study, fertility and early 
embryonic development studies, and a phototoxicity study, all outside the scope of ICH S9, were 
endorsed in scientific advice provided in 2013 by the CHMP. The performed studies include repeat-dose 
studies ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months in mice and 1 week to 9 months in dogs, in vitro and in vivo 
genetic toxicology, dose range-finding studies in mice and rats to support dose selection for possible 
carcinogenicity assessments, embryo-foetal development in female mice and rabbits, fertility and early 
embryonic development in male and female mice, dose range-finding in juvenile mice, and 
phototoxicity in hairless mice.  Other studies were in vitro genetic toxicity testing of the major human 
metabolite (M27) and in vitro and in vivo impurity qualification.

In Study R&D/10/905 venetoclax was tested against murine FL5.12 cells engineered to be dependent 
on either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL for survival upon interleukin-3 (IL-3) withdrawal and in a cellular mammalian 
two-hybrid assays to determine its effectiveness at disrupting complexes between anti-apoptotic family 
members (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1) and BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins (Bim, Bcl-XS, or Noxa, 
respectively,Table 2 and Table 3).

In studies R&D/10/1025, R&D/13/316 and R&D/12/538 Venetoclax exhibited activity against patient-
derived CLL cells treated ex vivo, killing these cells with an average EC50 of 6 nM (n = 35). Venetoclax 
was equally potent against CLL samples bearing the 17p deletion, with an average EC50 of 8 nM (n = 
5), indicating that it may have utility in treating patients with this high-risk lesion. Venetoclax induced 
killing of primary patient-derived AML cells with a median IC50 of 10-20 nM (n = 57). Quantitative 
immunoblotting of Bcl-2 family members revealed that venetoclax was particularly potent against cell 
lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2.  
In most cases these cell lines were positive for the t(14;18) translocation that drives high level 
expression of Bcl-2 from the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer. Bcl-2 protein levels and the 
t(14;18) translocation thus represent potential predictive biomarkers for sensitivity to venetoclax. 
Venetoclax inhibited the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples bearing 
the t(11;14) translocation. Venetoclax combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib 
demonstrated synergistic inhibition in certain multiple myeloma cell lines. These data indicate that 
venetoclax may have clinical utility as a single agent in patients with t(11;14)-positive multiple 
myeloma and in additional patients when combined with bortezomib. Data not shown.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of some lymphoid malignancies; 
antagonism of the action of this protein may enhance response to therapy and overcome resistance. 
Aberrant expression of Bcl-2 is common in CLL and CLL cells typically have a fundamental reliance on 
Bcl-2 for survival. Venetoclax has been developed as a selective inhibitor to Bcl-2.  
In vitro 
Biochemical characterization 
Venetoclax exhibits sub-nanomolar affinity for Bcl-2 (Ki <0.010 nM), it binds >4,800-fold and 
>20,000-fold less avidly to Bcl-XL and Bcl-w, respectively. The M27 metabolite (A-1621332) binds to 
Bcl-2 with a Ki of 2.2 nM (>220-fold lower than venetoclax) and shows lower affinity to Bcl-XL and Mcl-
1 (Ki >560 nM, >330 nM, respectively). M27 is not effective in killing either the Bcl-2-dependent or 
Bcl-XLdependent tumour cell lines (concentration required for 50% effect [EC50] >10,000 nM). 
Cellular assays 
Venetoclax potently killed FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells (EC50 4 nM), it showed much weaker activity against 
FL5.12-Bcl-XL cells (EC50 261 nM), indicating that this compound is functionally selective for Bcl-2. 
Venetoclax disrupted Bcl-2-Bim complexes further demonstrating the selectivity of the compound.  
Venetoclax was ineffective against murine embryonic fibroblasts from transgenic mice lacking Bax and 
Bak, indicating that this compound does not kill cells through some other off-target mechanism.  
Venetoclax induces key hallmarks of apoptosis, including cytochrome C release, caspase activation and 
the externalization of phosphatidylserine as measured by Annexin V staining. 
Venetoclax exhibited activity against patient-derived tumour cells treated ex vivo, killing CLL cells 
(including cells bearing the high-risk 17p deletion). Venetoclax also demonstrated killing of MM cell 
lines and primary tumour samples bearing the t(11;14) translocation (such cells tends to express high 
levels of Bcl-2 relative to Mcl-1). M27 is not effective in killing either the Bcl-2-dependent or Bcl-
XLdependent tumour cell lines. 
In vivo 
To evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy administered at a single dose or at 
doses in vivo, murine models with xenografted human tumour cells were developed in 
immunocompromised (severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] or SCID-beige) mice. (

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax in mouse, rat, dog and monkey was characterized by low 
plasma clearance values in monkey (0.27 L/hr*kg), rat (0.22 L/hr*kg), and mouse (0.14 L/hr*kg), 
with much lower values in dog (0.02 L/hr*kg). The compound was characterized by moderate to low 
volumes of distribution (Vss) in all species, with values ranging from 0.30 to 0.87 L/kg for mouse, dog, 
monkey and rat. The apparent elimination half-life ranged from 2.2 hr in monkey to approximately 12 
hr in dog. Oral bioavailability from a PEG-400 solution formulation was low and ranged from 8.6% in 
monkey to 27.8% in dog.  
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 24/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
Following intravenous administration to male CD-1 mice, radioactivity was well distributed into liver, 
kidneys, lungs, mesenteric lymph nodes and mandibular lymph nodes, while poor distribution was 
observed in adipose tissue. At 0.5 hr post dose, the highest radioactivity was found in liver, followed 
by lungs, mesenteric lymph nodes, mandibular lymph nodes, kidneys and adipose tissue. The 
maximum radioactivity was observed at 2 hr post dose for liver, kidneys and mesenteric lymph nodes, 
while at 1 hr post dose for lungs and 6 hr post dose for mandibular lymph nodes and adipose tissue. 
No tissue-specific retention of radioactivity was observed and radioactivity decreased after reaching 
maximal concentrations.  
In pigmented Long-Evans rats radioactivity was absorbed from an oral dose and distributed into 
tissues, with peak concentrations occurring at 4 hr post dose in most tissues. The rapid decline and 
elimination of radioactivity from the uveal tract and pigmented skin observed for both male and female 
rats illustrated that there was no evidence of selective association with the melanin-containing tissues 
of the pigmented rat. Concentrations of radioactivity in eye lens and the non-circumventricular central 
nervous system tissues were below measurable levels throughout the course of this study.  
Venetoclax is very highly protein bound, independent of concentration, with unbound fraction values 
<0.01. M27 is also highly protein bound in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human. Venetoclax and M27 
do not partition preferentially into the blood cellular compartment. 
Metabolism 
Biotransformation of venetoclax in nonclinical species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog) and human involves 
enzymatic oxidation on the dimethyl cyclohexenyl moiety to form M2, M3, M4 and M5. Also 
downstream metabolites are formed by further oxidation. In general, all human metabolites were also 
identified in at least one non-clinical toxicity species.  
In humans, M27 is the major metabolite in plasma, representing 12.0% of total radioactivity after a 
single oral dose. M27 represents up to 29.4% and 30.6% of venetoclax + M27 exposure at steady 
state in CLL or NHL patients who received a final dose of 400 and 600 mg/day of venetoclax treatment, 
respectively. M27 is present in plasma of non-clinical toxicology species in vivo at maximal tolerated 
doses (MTD) but at lower exposure than in human. M27 is not considered a human unique metabolite 
but is disproportionate. M27 was proposed to be formed via mono-oxidation of venetoclax on the 6-
position of the cyclohexenyl moiety to give M5, followed by enzyme-mediated cyclization at the α-
carbon of piperazine. 
Excretion 
Following oral administration of venetoclax to nonclinical species and humans, parent compound and 
metabolites were mainly cleared via biliary excretion and fecal elimination, with minimal renal 
clearance. In mice, 93.6% of an oral dose was eliminated in feces, with 0.6% of the dose recovered in 
the urine. In bile cannulated rats, 92.8% of an intravenous dose was recovered in the bile, with 0.4% 
of the dose recovered in the urine. In dog, 87.4% of the dose was recovered in the feces, with minimal 
renal elimination (0.1% of the dose). In the human radiolabeled mass balance study, a mean of 100% 
of the dose was recovered in feces, with <0.1% recovered in urine (216 hr collection period).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single-dose toxicity 
A single dose study in dogs was performed primarily to assess the effect and recovery of peripheral 
blood lymphocytes following a single dose. Generally dose-related decreases in lymphocyte counts 
were observed.  B-cells were the most sensitive lymphocyte subtype based on the magnitude of 
decrease and the length of time required for recovery. At ≥30 mg/kg, B-cell decreases of more than 
90% was observed, and recovery at 18 weeks post treatment. The effect on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells 
was slightly less pronounced. A generally dose-responsive decrease was observed at 30 and 
100 mg/kg; maximum decreases at 100 mg/kg (were -54% for CD4+ T-cells and -58% for 
CD8+ T-cells.  Recovery for both T-cell types was reached in less than a month, except for CD4+ T-
cells in one animal at 100 mg/kg, which required 15 weeks, and in another animal that exhibited 
partial recovery.  Overall, the time needed for recovery of peripheral blood lymphocyte decreases after 
a single dose was similar to that after 2 weeks of once daily dosing in dogs.

dosages of ≥5 mg/kg).  There was evidence of reversibility within 14 to 18 weeks post dose for total and 
lymphocyte subsets.

Repeat-dose toxicity 
The repeat-dose toxicity of venetoclax after oral administration was investigated in studies up to 6 
months in mice, and up to 9 months in dogs. The primary toxicities were effects on the haematologic 
system (decreased lymphocytes and red blood cell mass) in mice and dogs and on the male 
reproductive system (testicular germ cell depletion) in dogs.  Other noteworthy findings in dogs were 
epithelial single cell necrosis in multiple tissues and hair coat colour change.   
Mortality/clinical signs 
In mice, there were no remarkable venetoclax-related effects on clinical signs or body weights in any 
of the performed studies. However, there were a few mouse mortalities of unknown relation to 
venetoclax treatment. In the 4-week study, 1 male mouse was found dead at 600 mg/kg/day and in 
the 6-month study, two male mice were found dead, one each at 15 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
No significant clinical observations were present in these animals prior to demise and the cause of the 
death could not be ascertained following macroscopic and microscopic evaluation. Therefore, the 
relation to venetoclax-treatment is unclear. However, based on the absence of any significant findings 
apart from those of the on the haematologic system, the deaths are considered as likely incidental. 
In dogs, venetoclax administration in the 4-week study was associated with dose-related, transient 
post-dose emesis, increased salivation and fecal alterations at dosages of ≥5 mg/kg/day.  At the 
highest dose in the 4-week study, mild to moderate signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head 
(cranial area) and forepaws and/or hindpaws were observed in 8 of 10 dogs. In three dogs, the 
swelling reaction was observed after the first dose.  The clinical signs were transient and sporadic in 
occurrence, and were absent during the recovery period.  A mechanistic basis for the swelling reactions 
was not established, but there were no signs of anaphylaxis. In the 9-month dog study, non-adverse 
decreases in mean body weight and body weight gain, associated with decreases in food consumption, 
were observed at ≥2 mg/kg/day. 
Effects on lymphocytes (mice and dogs) 
Venetoclax produced mild to marked, generally dose-related decreases in leukocytes (primarily, 
lymphocytes) in peripheral blood and in lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues at all dose levels 
administered to mice from 2 weeks to 6 months and to dogs from 1 week to 9 months.  Decreases in 
peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were similar across dosing periods, with maximum decreases 
ranging from -69% to -75% in mice, to -64% in rats and to -81% in dogs.  Decreased peripheral blood 
lymphocytes (assessed in dogs) in repeat-dose studies were observed by approximately 24 hours after 
the first dose and reached a maximum after approximately 2 weeks of dosing.  Correlating with 
decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were minimal to moderate lymphocyte decreases in 
lymphoid tissues, including the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches/gut-associated 
lymphoid tissue (GALT).  Decreases in peripheral blood lymphocytes exhibited evidence of reversibility 
in mice and dogs, but the time required for reversibility was considerably longer in dogs (18 weeks) 
than in mice (4 weeks).  Lymphocyte subsets (mature T-cells, helper [CD4+] T-cells, cytotoxic [CD8+] 
T-cells, and [CD21+] mature B-cells) were assessed in dogs.  All lymphocyte subtypes were 
decreased, with the greatest decreases observed in B-cell counts (>-90%).  Similar to total 
lymphocyte counts, both B-cells and T-cells required up to 18 weeks for reversibility after completion 
of a 2-week dosing period in dogs.  Following 4 weeks of dosing in dogs, reversibility did not occur 
after a 4-week recovery period.

Effects on red blood cells (mice and dogs) 
Dose-related decreases in indicators of red blood cell mass were similar in mice and dogs.  
Haemoglobin decreases reached -21% in mice at 600 mg/kg/day (AUCss 91 µghr/mL) and -23% in 
dogs at 150 mg/kg/day (AUCss 572 µghr/mL) following 4 weeks of dosing.  Based on magnitude 
(>20%), these decreases in haemoglobin were considered to be adverse.  The corresponding NOAELs 
were 200 mg/kg/day in mice and 50 mg/kg/day in dogs, corresponding to 1.9- and 14.8-fold the 
clinical AUC exposure, respectively.  In the 4-week studies, decreased red cell mass reversed at the 
end of the 4-week recovery periods.  With increased duration of dosing and lower dosages, dose-
related decreases in RBC mass (haemoglobin) were observed in mice (up to -13%) in the 6-month 
study at ≥50 mg/kg/day (AUCss ≥9.6 µghr/mL); in the 9-month dog study, there were no decreases in 
haemoglobin, but dose-related reductions were observed in mean corpuscular volume (up to -17%) 
and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (up to -18%) at ≥6 mg/kg/day (AUCss ≥52.1 µghr/mL).   The 
NOAELs for these effects in the longer duration studies in mice and dogs correspond to exposures of 
0.9- and 2.7-fold the clinical AUC, respectively.  
Effects on male reproductive organs (dogs) 
In dogs, venetoclax caused adverse, non-dose-related microscopic findings in testes at all dose levels 
administered for 4 weeks (≥5 mg/kg/day) and 9 months (≥2 mg/kg/day).  In the 4-week study, these 
findings consisted of severe decreases in the numbers of spermatogonia, with progression to severe 
decreases in the numbers of all germ cells in testes during the 4-week recovery period.  In the 
9-month study, the findings were characterized as moderate to severe bilateral degeneration/atrophy 
of the seminiferous tubules.  In both studies, testes weights were decreased, and in the 9-month 
study, prostate weights were decreased.  The corresponding plasma exposures (mean AUCss) at 5 and 
2 mg/kg/day were 59.3 µghr/mL and 15.1 µghr/mL, respectively, corresponding to ~1.9- and 0.4-fold 
the clinical AUC. Mice did not have testicular changes associated with venetoclax administration.   
Effects on epithelial tissues (single cell necrosis, dogs) 
Single cell necrosis was observed in multiple epithelial tissues of the dog following daily administration 
of venetoclax from 1 week to 9 months; the lowest AUC values at which these changes were observed 
were 61 µghr/mL, ~2-fold clinical AUC (5 mg/kg/day, 4-week study) and 17 µghr/mL, ~0.5-fold the 
clinical AUC (2 mg/kg/day, 9-month study).  Affected tissues were gallbladder epithelium, exocrine 
pancreas, prostate, epididymides and stomach.  These changes were minimal to mild.  Reversibility 
was evaluated in the 4-week study, and was observed in gallbladder and exocrine pancreas, but not in 
the prostate and epididymides (potentially associated with testicular germ cell loss) or in the stomach.  
Single-cell necrosis was considered not to be adverse due to its minimal to mild magnitude and 
because no loss of mucosal integrity was observed microscopically.  There were no venetoclax-related 
findings of single cell necrosis in mice; the maximum achieved AUCss in mice was 91 µghr/mL, 
corresponding to ~2.9-fold the clinical AUC.  
Effects on hair coat colour (dogs) 
In the 9-month dog study, a change in colour of the hair coat to white was observed at ≥6 mg/kg/day 
after approximately 3 months of dosing.  The affected hair was initially on the muzzle.  From 3 to 9 
months of dosing, loss of hair pigmentation progressed from the muzzle to affect the majority of 
normally darkly pigmented hair and correlated microscopically with decreased pigment in hair follicle 
bulbs.  Physical examinations of the skin (epidermis) and ophthalmic examinations determined that 
pigmentation of the skin and in the eye (particularly in the pigmented iris and fundus) appeared 
unaffected.  This was confirmed by the absence of associated histopathologic findings in skin (other 
than in hair follicle bulbs) and in the eye. Hair coat colour change could not be assessed in CD-1 mice

or Sprague-Dawley rats due to the white hair coat in these strains, but a change to gray coat colour 
was also observed in NZBWF1 mice (lupus model) treated daily with 100 or 33 mg/kg of venetoclax, 
but not at lower dosages.   
Other effects (dogs) 
In dogs, non-adverse, minimally increased pigment was observed in Kupffer cells or macrophages in 
the liver and gallbladder, respectively, at ≥5 mg/kg/day in the four-week study and at ≥2 mg/kg/day 
in the nine-month study.  No corresponding increases in pigment in these or other tissues were 
observed in mice or rats. 
Interspecies comparison 
In the 4-week repeat-dose studies, the AUC exposure multiples at the highest dose levels compared to 
the clinical AUC were ~2.9-fold in mice and ~18-fold in dogs. In the longer duration studies, the AUC 
exposures were around the clinical exposure in mice and ~2.7-fold dogs.  
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of venetoclax was evaluated in a series of non-GLP and GLP in vitro and in vivo 
studies as summarised below. Venetoclax was tested negative in a complete package of genotoxicity 
studies including test for gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in vitro and chromosomal 
aberrations in vivo.

+S9, 3 hrs: Cytotoxicity at 50 µg/mL (51% 
reduction in MI). A small increase in the 
number of chromatid exchanges (triradials 
and quadriradials) at 50 µg/mL. The increase 
was statistically insignificant and within the 
historical control value. Therefore, the low 
level of chromatid exchanges observed are 
not considered to have any biological 
relevance. 
Negative  
Adequate positive and negative controls 
produced expected effects. 
TK: Mean AUC was 106/159, 127/184 and 
179/278 µgh/mL in M/F at 208.8, 417.5, 
and 835 mg/kg, respectively. 
Mortality: None. 
Micronucleus assay: Venetoclax did not 
induce statistically significant increases in 
micronucleated PCEs at any dose except in F 
at 835 mg/kg. However, this increase was 
not considered to be biologically significant 
since the % micronucleated PCEs from the 
high dose females (0.14%) were within 
historical control values (0.00 to 0.15%). 
Venetoclax was cytotoxic to the bone 
marrow at 417.5 and 835 mg/kg in males 
and at 835 mg/kg in females. The 
micronucleated PCEs observed in the vehicle 
control group were within the historical 
control range for males (0.02± 0.03% and 
0.07±0.06% for the 24- and 48-hour time 
points, respectively) and females 
(0.03±0.03% and 0.03±0.04% for the 24- 
and 48-hour time points, respectively).

Carcinogenicity  
No carcinogenicity studies were performed which in view of the applied indication is acceptable and in 
agreement with recommendations in ICH S9. To support future indications outside the scope of S9, 
dose range-finding studies in wild type littermates of Tg.rasH2 mice (up to 4 weeks) and in Sprague 
Dawley rats (up to 13 weeks) were performed to enable dose selection for possible carcinogenicity 
assessments. The primary toxicity in rats was similar to that previously observed in mice and dogs, i.e. 
effects on the haematological system (decreased lymphocytes and red blood cell mass).  
Fertility, early embryonic development and reprotoxicity  
In fertility and early embryonic development studies conducted in male and female mice there were no 
effects on fertility, pregnancy (implantation), ovarian and uterine parameters, male or female 
reproductive organs, or on female estrus cycling.  The NOAEL for males and for females was 600 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to 2.7- and 3.1-fold the clinical AUC, respectively. However, in repeat-dose 
toxicology studies, venetoclax caused irreversible testicular germ cell depletions in dogs at exposures 
below the clinical AUC exposure, suggesting a risk for irreversible infertility in male patients treated 
with venetoclax.  
Embryo-fetal development toxicology studies were conducted in pregnant mice and rabbits.   
In the mouse DRF study a pronounced embryo-foetal toxicity was observed, i.e. a dose-related 
increased post-implantation loss up to about 90% at the highest dose corresponding to about 2 times 
clinical exposure and in the absence of overt maternal toxicity. In the pivotal mouse study, findings 
were limited to the top dosage of 150 mg/kg/day, and consisted of (1) increased post-implantation 
loss (associated with an increase in early resorptions and corresponding decreases in litter size and 
numbers of live foetuses per litter) and (2) decreased foetal body weight.  There were no 
venetoclax-related fetal external, soft-tissue, or skeletal malformations or variations.  The NOAEL for 
mouse maternal toxicity was 150 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 1.1-fold the clinical AUC, and the 
NOAEL for mouse embryo-foetal toxicity was 50 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.8-fold the clinical AUC.   
In the rabbit study, 4 dams were found dead or euthanized at the highest dose tested, 300 mg/kg/day. 
These early deaths were preceded by adverse clinical signs, maternal body weight losses and severely 
reduced food consumption and necropsy revealed gross abnormalities in the GI tract in three out of the 
four dams. The mean AUC at 300 mg/kg/day on GD19 was 4900 ngh/mL corresponding to ~0.1 fold 
the clinical AUC. Despite the maternal toxicity, there were no effects on reproductive parameters (e.g., 
post-implantation loss) or foetal parameters (e.g., external, visceral, or skeletal development).  The 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 100 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.07-fold the clinical AUC, and 
NOAEL for embryo-foetal development was 300 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.2-fold the clinical AUC. 
Local tolerance 
No dedicated local tolerance studies were performed. The local tolerance after oral administration is 
considered adequately assessed in performed oral repeat-dose toxicology studies.  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Venetoclax absorbs ultraviolet light between 200 and 390 nm and in the visible spectrum from 400 to 
<500 nm with MEC values above the threshold value.  Poor distribution of [14C]-venetoclax to the eyes 
and to both pigmented and non-pigmented skin was observed following a single oral dose to Long 
Evans rats. Based on the light absorbance, the phototoxic potential of venetoclax was evaluated in a 3-
day in vivo phototoxicity study using hairless female mice. In this study, no indications of phototoxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016

in skin were evident at doses ≤825 mg/kg/day. Therefore, venetoclax is considered to have a low 
phototoxic potential. 
Metabolites 
Metabolite M27 was identified as a major metabolite of venetoclax in humans representing ~12% of 
the total plasma radioactivity in the human mass balance study. M27 was not mutagenic in the Ames 
test and nor was micronucleus induction observed in the in vitro micronucleus test in peripheral 
lymphycytes. M27 was present in both mice and dogs at the maximum tolerated dose, but at much 
lower exposure than in humans.  The mean gender combined AUC exposure to M27 in 5-days repeat-
dose studies in mice and dogs was 0.76 and 1.27 µg·h/mL, respectively, which represent 
approximately 5 and 9%, respectively, of the exposure observed in humans (geometric mean 
AUCss,24 = 14.1 µg·h/mL) at 400 mg venetoclax.  
Impurities 
The drug substance impurities A-1470045.0, A-1258315.0, A-1550366.0 and A-1550367.0, and the 
drug product degradants A-1548065.0 and A-1548068.0 are all considered adequately qualified at the 
proposed specification levels.  The control strategy for the genotoxic or potentially genotoxic and 
carcinogenic impurities are considered as adequate.

Venetoclax is considered not to be persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), nor very persistent, 
very bioaccumulative (vPvB). A risk to the sewage treatment plant (STP) is not anticipated based on 
the prescribed use of venetoclax. It is noted that the methodology used to calculate the PECsediment and 
PECsoil in the ERA  as in accordance to the Q&A document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) q6 and 
section 5.3.3 of the ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) where reference is made to the 
proper methodology for PECsediment and PECsoil calculations using Koc, sludge. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the

CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
 
To correct the PEC calculation in the environmental risk assessment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The binding and inhibition data show that Venetoclax is a selective inhibitor of Bcl-2. The data also 
show that Venetoclax increases the percentage of apoptotic cells and induces cell death of patient 
derived cancer cells. This increase in apoptosis was shown to be dependent on functional Blc-2. In 
murine proof-of-concept models venetoclax showed inhibition of subcutaneous xenograft growth of 
human tumour cell lines.  
The major human metabolite, M27, was assessed for Bcl-2 binding and effect on cell viability. The data 
show that M27 was able to bind to Bcl-2 with about 220-fold lower affinity than venetoclax. In 
addition, M27 was unable to induce apoptosis in treated cells.  
At plasma concentrations of ≥16 μg/mL in anesthetized dogs Venetoclax produced mild reductions in 
myocardial contractility. This effect was not observed in conscious dogs. The therapeutic dosage of 
venetoclax is 400 mg/day for the target indication and is associated with average steady state plasma 
exposures of 2.1 μg/mL (Cmax). The exposures reached in the safety pharmacology studies are 
considered to be sufficient. In general, the non-clinical data show a negligible risk for QT/ECG effects 
at clinical exposures, effect on QT was also addressed in the clinical study M12-175 (see clinical 
safety).   
The PK profile of venetoclax show low plasma clearance and moderate to low volume of distribution in 
all species tested. Venetoclax elimination half-life ranged from 2.2 hours in monkey to 12 hours in dog 
with a bioavailability ranging from 8.6% to 27.8%. Venetoclax showed distribution into tissues with 
peak concentration after 4 hours. No tissue-specific retention was observed, including pigmented 
tissues. Venetoclax did not distribute to the CNS.  
Biotransformation of venetoclax in nonclinical species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog) and human involves 
enzymatic oxidation on the dimethyl cyclohexenyl moiety. In humans, M27 is the major metabolite in 
plasma, representing 14.0% of total radioactivity after a single oral dose. M27 is present in plasma of 
non-clinical toxicology species in vivo at MTD but at considerably lower exposure than in human. M27 
is not considered a human unique metabolite but is disproportionate. 
Following oral administration of venetoclax to nonclinical species and humans, parent compound and 
metabolites were mainly cleared via biliary excretion and fecal elimination, with minimal renal 
clearance. 
Venetoclax produced mild to marked, generally dose-related decreases in leukocytes (primarily, 
lymphocytes) in peripheral blood and in lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, with maximum decreases in 
peripheral blood ranging from -69% to -75% in mice, to -64% in rats and to -81% in dogs. The 
observed lymphocyte decreases are an expected effect of Bcl-2 inhibition.  The lymphocyte decreases 
in lymphoid tissues were not as pronounced as in peripheral blood. In the 39-week dog study, minimal 
to mild decreases in lymphocytes were observed in Peyer's patch, mesenteric and mandibular lymph 
nodes, whereas no effects were noted in thymus, spleen, and popliteal and tracheobronchial lymph 
nodes. In the 26-week mouse study, lymphocyte decreases among lymphoid tissues were minimal to 
moderate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 34/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Despite the substantial decrease of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and to lesser extent in lymphoid 
tissues, venetoclax did not cause an apparent impaired immune function at the level of challenge 
encountered in laboratory housing (see also clinical safety).   
Dose-related decreases in indicators of red blood cell mass were similar in mice and dogs and the 
NOAELs for these effects in the longer duration studies correspond to exposures 0.9- and 2.7-fold the 
clinical AUC, in mice and dogs, respectively. Decreased haemoglobin and/or anaemia have also been 
observed in patients. Decreases in red cell mass are readily monitored by routine haematology analysis 
in patients and the non-clinical data suggest that the effects are reversible. Both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are 
speculated to be involved in the decreased RBC mass. Although venetoclax is highly selective for Bcl-2 
(Ki <0.010 nM), it could exert a slight effect on Bcl-XL (Ki 48 nM). Bcl-XL is essential for maturation 
and survival of erythroid cells, particularly at the later stages. However, studies have also indicated 
that erythropoietin control of Bcl-2 during proliferation and differentiation contributes to the viability of 
erythroid progenitor cells.  Therefore, on-target pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-2 by venetoclax could 
play a role in the observed decreases in red cell mass.  Bcl-XL is also important for haeme synthesis 
and silencing of Bcl-XL expression in experimental models greatly decreased haemoglobin synthesis.  
Minimal to mild single cell necrosis was observed in multiple epithelial tissues (gallbladder epithelium, 
exocrine pancreas, prostate, epididymides and stomach) of the dog following daily administration of 
venetoclax from 1 week to 9 months.  Reversibility was observed in gallbladder and exocrine pancreas, 
but not in the prostate and epididymides (potentially associated with testicular germ cell loss) or in the 
stomach. The epithelial single cell necrosis was not associated with other signs of organ toxicity such 
as inflammation or disrupted tissue architecture. The nature of the finding seems consistent with 
apoptosis although this was not confirmed by dedicated staining techniques. As bcl-2 is known to be 
expressed in various epithelia, the finding is considered likely due to the pharmacological action of 
venetoclax. Although the clinical significance of the epithelial single cell necrosis in unclear, based on 
the magnitude of effect and lack of associated toxicity, no serious or adverse effects on epithelial 
tissues are expected in the clinical situation. 
In the 9-month dog study, a change in colour of the hair coat to white was observed after 
approximately 3 months of dosing.  The effect on hair coat colour is considered a likely effect of Bcl-2 
inhibition. Evidence from Bcl-2 knock-out mouse (Bcl-2 -/-) studies indicates that hair 
hypopigmentation occurs due to loss of hair follicle melanocytes dependent on Bcl-2 for survival; 
therefore a risk for hair colour change in CLL patients cannot be excluded (see also discussion on 
clinical safety).  
Venetoclax was tested negative in a complete package of genotoxicity studies including test for gene 
mutations and chromosomal aberrations in vitro and chromosomal aberrations in vivo. No 
carcinogenicity studies were performed which in view of the applied indication is acceptable according 
to ICH S9.  
In fertility and early embryonic development studies conducted in male and female mice there were no 
treatment-related effects on any of the investigated parameters. However, in dogs, venetoclax caused 
irreversible testicular germ cell depletions at exposures below the clinical exposure, suggesting a risk 
for irreversible infertility in male patients treated with venetoclax. The testicular germ cell depletions in 
dogs may be related to venetoclax pharmacology, as one or more members of the Bcl-2 family of 
proteins play a role in spermatogenesis.  However, no testicular changes were evident in mice, and the 
basis for the greater sensitivity of dogs as compared with that of mice to testicular germ cell decreases 
is unclear. Based on the severe testicular toxicity in dogs, section 4.6 of the SmPC includes a 
recommendation that counselling on sperm storage may be considered in male patients prior to 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 35/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initiation of treatment. Testicular toxicity is considered a potential risk for the human situation, and is 
also included as such in the RMP.  
Embryo-foetal development toxicology studies were conducted in pregnant mice and rabbits. In the 
rabbit study, 4 dams were found dead or euthanized at the highest dose tested, 300 mg/kg/day. These 
early deaths were preceded by adverse clinical signs, maternal body weight losses and severely 
reduced food consumption and necropsy revealed gross abnormalities in the GI tract in three out of the 
four dams. The mean AUC at 300 mg/kg/day on GD19 was 4900 ngh/mL corresponding to ~0.2 fold 
the clinical AUC. Therefore, the rabbit seems more sensitive to venetoclax-related effects than the 
other investigated species.  
Regarding embryo-foetal effects, no venetoclax-related malformations indicative of a teratogenic 
potential were observed in the performed mouse and rabbit EFD studies. However, the results of the 
preliminary mouse study show serious embryo-foetal toxicity, i.e. a dose-related increased post-
implantation loss up to about 90% at the highest dose corresponding to about 2 times clinical exposure 
and in the absence of overt maternal toxicity. No embryo-foetal toxicity was observed in the rabbit 
studies, but as the exposures were about 0.1-fold the clinical exposure, the lack of embryo-foetal 
toxicity is not considered reassuring for the human situation. Nevertheless, the limited data available 
from the mouse EFD studies indicate serious concern for use during pregnancy. In addition, as 
venetoclax is first-in-class, clinical experience is lacking. Therefore, embryo-foetal toxicity is included 
as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
The results of an in vivo phototoxicity study in mice suggest that venetoclax has a low phototoxic 
potential. 
Metabolite 27, a major human metabolite, was tested negative in in vitro genotoxicity studies. M27 
was present in both mice and dogs at the maximum tolerated dose, but at much lower exposures than 
in humans. Although M27 cannot be considered as qualified from a non-clinical perspective, further 
non-clinical testing is not warranted based on the intended target population with advanced cancer. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Venetoclax is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB. A risk to the STP is not anticipated based on the 
prescribed use of venetoclax. Correction of the PEC calculation in the environmental risk assessment 
should be provided in accordance with the ERA guideline. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology programs are considered 
sufficient. 
All relevant information has been included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. The risk of embryo-
foetal toxicity is included as a potential important risk in the RMP.  
Correction of the PEC calculation in the environmental risk assessment should be provided. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed 
 
To correct the PEC calculation in the environmental risk assessment in accordance with EMA 
guidance.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data are available from six efficacy and/or safety studies in patients with CLL/SLL or 
NHL and from six dedicated biopharmaceutic/pharmacokinetic studies in NHL patients or in healthy 
female volunteers of non-childbearing potential, including drug-drug interaction studies.  
Biopharmaceutics and absorption  
Venetoclax is considered practically insoluble or insoluble ( 10,000 parts of solvent to dissolve 1 part 
of solute) in aqueous solutions across a pH range of 1 to 12.9. The solubility in aqueous buffer is pH-
dependent.  
The commercial formulation is an immediate-release film-coated tablet, available in the strengths 
10 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg.  Comparable bioavailability has been shown between clinical trial 
formulations and the market formulation. There is no bioavailability comparison between different 
strengths.  
A study in Caco-2 cells indicated that venetoclax may have moderate permeability, and would 
therefore be classified as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class IV compound. 
However, the Caco-2 cell study was inconclusive. In the mass-balance study, the degree of absorption 
from an oral solution appeared to be high (>85%) at administration with food. The absolute 
bioavailability is not known. Based on a clinical interaction study, there is likely some first-pass 
metabolism via CYP3A4.

EMA/725631/2016

Figure 4: Forest plot of the food effect in the population pharmacokinetic model 
After administration of the film-coated tablet with food (generally within 30 minutes after breakfast), 
Tmax values of about 4-8 hr have been observed in different studies. The Tmax in the mass-balance 
study (oral solution with food) was in the same range.  
No effect of gastric acid-reducing agents on venetoclax exposure was seen in a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, but the results should be interpreted with caution as short- and long-acting 
agents were grouped together and the exact dosing information for the short-acting agents was not 
known/reported.  
The effect of alcohol on the disintegration, dissolution and solubility of venetoclax 10 and 100 mg 
tablets was investigated. The effects of ethanol appeared to be dose dependent with more pronounced 
effects for the 100 mg tablet. Ethanol accelerated the disintegration of venetoclax 100 mg tablets but 
data suggest that in presence of 20% and 40% ethanol, the solubility of venetoclax in the dissolution 
medium is lower and drug release is incomplete. 
Distribution 
The mean estimated V2/F in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was 118 L. 
Venetoclax and M27 are highly protein bind in human plasma. The mean unbound fraction (fu) of 
venetoclax was 0.000013. There was no concentration dependence (1-30 μM). For M27, the unbound 
concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (1 nM) of the HPLC-MS/MS analytical method in 
most samples. The calculated unbound fraction of M27 was <0.0028 in human plasma. The mean 
unbound fraction of venetoclax in human liver microsomes (0.25 mg/mL) was around 0.0012 µM. The 
unbound fraction of venetoclax in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) could not be determined because it 
was below the limit of detection.  
Blood-plasma ratios of venetoclax and M27 in human blood were 0.57 and 0.47, respectively.  
Elimination 
All studies on elimination and drug-drug interactions have been performed in the fed state.  
Mass-balance data indicate that absorption of venetoclax is complete or almost complete after 
administration of an oral solution with a moderate-fat breakfast, as most of the recovered drug-related

material was found in late faecal samples. Excretion of venetoclax and metabolites was almost 
exclusively in faeces. Urinary excretion was minimal (<0.1% of the dose). About 80% of the dose was 
recovered as metabolites in faeces, and 20% as venetoclax. Metabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway, but there is some uncertainty whether the major metabolites in faeces were 
formed locally in the intestine from venetoclax that had been excreted unchanged. If this is the case, 
excretion of unchanged parent may represent up to about 50% of the elimination.  
Over 30 different metabolites have been identified. The only major metabolite in plasma, M27, has an 
AUC0- that is 40-50% of parent AUC0- after repeated doses. M27 is considered minimally active 
against Bcl-2 and is not expected to contribute to the overall pharmacological activity. No other 
metabolites accounted for more than 10% of the radioactivity in plasma. 
In vitro, venetoclax and M27 were metabolised primarily via CYP3A4. There was no involvement of 
UGTs or FMO3. The importance of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism was confirmed by an in vivo 
interaction study with the CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor ketoconazole.  
Both venetoclax and M27 are substrates of Pgp and BCRP, and these transporters may therefore be 
involved in the absorption and first-pass metabolism as well as the excretion of unchanged venetoclax. 
Venetoclax is likely not an OATP1B1/1B3 substrate.  
Apparent clearance (CL/F) estimated in the population analysis was 447 L/Day (18 L/hr). The 
population estimate for the terminal elimination half-life of venetoclax was approximately 26 hours. 
This is in line with the half-life determined in the single dose mass-balance study, which was 23 hr. 
Metabolite M27 had a half-life of approximately 59 hr in the mass-balance study.  
Dose linearity and time dependency 
In a dose-escalation study and in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was a slight tendency 
to decreased dose-normalised AUC with increasing doses over the dose range 20-1200 mg. There was 
no sign of altered pharmacokinetics over time at multiple dosing. Based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, the accumulation of venetoclax with daily dosing in male and female cancer 
patients was 1.44 and 1.30, respectively. 
Variability 
As often seen for CYP3A4 substrates, venetoclax pharmacokinetic inter-individual variability is high 
with a total variability coefficient of variation (%CV) in Cmax and AUC of approximately 50% at the 
400 mg dose at steady-state.  In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the %CV of the inter-
individual variability for CL/F, V2/F, and F1 were 47.7%, 58.0%, and 31.3%, respectively. 
Target population 
Pharmacokinetics of venetoclax was described by a two-compartment PK model with first-order 
absorption and elimination. The population pharmacokinetic analysis predicted no difference in 
venetoclax CL/F between healthy subjects and patients with CLL/SLL or NHL, respectively. 
CLL/SLL/NHL subjects were estimated to have V2/F that is 1.71-fold higher than healthy subjects. This 
difference was likely caused by the more frequent sampling in studies in healthy subjects and better 
capturing Cmax. The difference in V/F does not affect exposure (AUC).  
Special populations 
The effects of different intrinsic factors on venetoclax pharmacokinetics have been evaluated by 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse and/or rich data from eight phase 1/1b/2 clinical 
studies.

There was no effect of mild to moderate renal impairment on venetoclax clearance, which was 
expected based on the minimal renal excretion of venetoclax observed in the mass-balance study. 
Data for severe renal impairment and ESRD is missing.  
There was no effect of mild hepatic impairment on venetoclax CL/F. The population pharmacokinetic 
analysis included only 7 and one patient with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, 
and no conclusions can be drawn for these populations. A study in severe hepatic impairment is 
planned. 
CLL is primarily a disease of adults, particularly the elderly. Venetoclax exposure was not different in 
elderly patients compared to younger patients. The population pharmacokinetic analysis also indicated 
no relevant effects of sex, age or weight on venetoclax CL/F. The evaluation of potential effects of race 
is hampered by the very limited number of patients of other races than Caucasian and Black that were 
included in the analysis. 
There is no pharmacokinetic data in children, which is acceptable given the indication applied for.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Venetoclax as victim 
In vitro data showed that venetoclax is a substrate for CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP. Accordingly, in vivo 
interaction studies have been performed with a CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor (ketoconazole) a PXR inducer 
(multiple dose rifampicin) and a Pgp inhibitor (single dose rifampicin). 
Ketoconazole increased venetoclax AUC by on average 6.4-fold, with large inter-individual variability in 
the effect. Also Cmax and half-life increased, indicating an effect on first-pass metabolism as well as 
on elimination. AUC for the metabolite M27 decreased upon ketoconazole co-treatment, in line with 
decreased formation. Multiple-dose rifampicin decreased venetoclax AUC by 70%. These data confirm 
the contribution of CYP3A4/Pgp to the elimination of venetoclax.   
Single-dose rifampicin led to about 80% increase in the AUC of venetoclax, which may be due to 
inhibition of Pgp.  
Venetoclax and M27 as perpetrators 
The potential of venetoclax and M27 to inhibit or induce CYPs and to inhibit UGTs or transporters has 
been primarily investigated in vitro. There is one in vivo interaction study with warfarin (CYP2C9 
substrate).  
Based on the IC50s determined in the in vitro studies and comparison with the clinical exposure data, 
venetoclax and, in some cases, M27 may be clinically relevant competitive inhibitors of CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, UGT1A1, Pgp, BCRP and OATP1B1. There were no signs of time-dependent inhibition in vitro. 
No potential to inhibit systemic CYP3A4 was seen, while the concentrations in the in vitro studies were 
too low to determine the risk for inhibition (competitive or time-dependent) of intestinal CYP3A4 by 
venetoclax.  
In vitro induction data were inconclusive due to cell toxicity at higher concentrations. There was a 
small signal of induction of CYP1A2 and 2B6 (i.e. induction via Ah receptor and CAR) for venetoclax. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 41/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no sign of induction of CYP3A4 (i.e. induction via PXR) at relevant systemic or attainable gut 
concentrations, taking the low solubility of venetoclax in intestinal fluid into account.   
The most sensitive CYP for in vitro inhibition by venetoclax was CYP2C9. An in vivo interaction study 
with the narrow-therapeutic index substrate warfarin was performed in healthy female volunteers of 
non-childbearing potential. Only a single dose of venetoclax was administered, and the effect is likely 
underestimated. The AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) increased about 28% and AUC of R-
warfarin (CYP3A4 substrate) increased about 20%. As an effect was seen on both R-warfarin, which is 
not a CYP2C9 substrate, and S-warfarin it was suggested that the effect was not a result of CYP2C9 
inhibition.  
PBPK modelling 
A PBPK model was used to simulate effect of different moderate and severe CYP3A4 inhibitors on 
venetoclax exposure, in order to support proposed dosing recommendations for venetoclax if CYP3A4 
inhibitors need to be concomitantly administered.  
The effects of different moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors were evaluated, in order to take into 
account differences of potency. The moderate CYP3A inhibitors were estimated to increase the 
venetoclax Cmax by 1.40- to 2.00-fold and increase the venetoclax AUC∞ by 1.98- to 4.85-fold.  Thus, 
for all the evaluated moderate inhibitors the venetoclax AUC∞ increased by at least 2-fold, which is the 
recommended minimal venetoclax dose reduction with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The strong CYP3A 
inhibitors were estimated to increase the venetoclax Cmax by 2.02- to 2.50-fold and increase the 
venetoclax AUC∞ by 5.82- to 7.83-fold.  In all cases, the recommend 4-fold reduction in venetoclax 
dose with strong CYP3A inhibitors maintains the AUC∞ above the equivalent AUC∞ that would be 
achieved in the absence of a strong CYP3A inhibitor at 400 mg. 
Inter-individual variability in venetoclax exposure was similar with and without CYP3A4 inhibition. 
Simulations of individual venetoclax exposures obtained when using the proposed dose reductions with 
different CYP3A4 inhibitors was performed. These simulations indicated that the recommended dose 
reductions with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors generally maintains the venetoclax AUC24 
exposures within the range achieved at 400 mg QD and 1200 mg QD.  With erythromycin, the 
simulated median venetoclax AUC24 achieved with 200 mg venetoclax was above that achieved 
1200 mg QD alone, but there was considerable overlap between the individual exposures.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In study M12-175 116 subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL were treated with venetoclax: 
56 subjects across 8 dose escalation cohorts (150 mg to 1200 mg)  and in 60 subjects in the 400 mg 
safety expansion cohort. For CLL/SLL subjects, the initial dose was 200 mg per the original protocol 
and then was decreased to ≤ 50 mg and finally to 20 mg for TLS prophylaxis. 
Mean and median time to 50% reduction in lymphocyte count among subjects with  baseline 
lymphocyte count > 5 × 109/L was 1.9 and 2.0 weeks, respectively, for subjects in the dose escalation 
cohorts and 1.6 and 1.3 weeks, respectively, for subjects in the safety expansion cohort. Among 
subjects with lymphocytosis (ALC > 5 × 109/L) at baseline, ALC decreased in a dose-dependent 
manner after the first dose by a median of 15%, 33% and 97% for 20 mg, 50 mg, and 100/200 mg 
first doses, respectively (see Figure 6). There was a more gradual reduction in ALC following the initial 
cohort and implementation of the extended titration period.

High response rates were observed across the dose cohorts and subpopulations (see Table 12). Initial 
responses were observed early with median time to PR of 1.4 months. Deeper responses were 
observed with longer time on treatment; median time to CR/CRi in the dose escalation cohorts was 5.6 
months with a range of 2.8 to 19.4 months. More favourable findings were observed in dose cohorts 
treated with venetoclax 400 mg daily or higher, as compared with cohorts treated with a daily dose 
less than 400 mg. Durable response at 12 months was estimated for the majority of subjects.

Analysis of preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and overall safety in Study M12 -175 at doses from 
150 to 1200 mg venetoclax for CLL/SLL subjects led to the selection of 400 mg as the dose to explore 
further in the CLL/SLL safety expansion cohort of this study. At the time of the dose selection, time on 
study was limited to the first 6 to 12 months, with shorter follow-up for the higher dose cohorts. ORR 
was not different when comparing results for subjects treated at 400 mg versus those treated at 
higher doses. No maximum tolerated dose was established, but adverse events were slightly higher at 
doses higher than 400 mg. The 400 mg QD dose was selected to obtain additional safety information 
at that dose level. 
Dose response was also evaluated for venetoclax when administered in combination with rituximab. 
Study M13-365 was a Phase 1b, open-label, non-fasting, multicenter study designed to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of venetoclax in combination with rituximab in subjects with relapsed CLL/SLL. 
After the lead-in period (Weeks 1 through 5), subjects within each cohort received venetoclax 200, 
300, 400, 500 or 600 mg QD in combination with rituximab. The study is ongoing. Preliminary activity 
of venetoclax in combination with rituximab demonstrated that the majority of subjects (40 [81.6%]) 
across all cohorts achieved objective response (13 CR, 5 CRi, 2 nPR, and 20 PR). Efficacy was observed 
at all doses (see Clinical efficacy) 
Exposure response relationship 
The exposure-effect and exposure-safety relationship for venetoclax have been evaluated by a 
population PKPD analysis and by repeated measures logistic regression analysis.  
Efficacy data (i.e., lymphocytes, tumour size, and OR/CRi/CR) from three Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical 
trials of venetoclax monotherapy or combination therapy (with rituximab) in R/R CLL/SLL subjects 
were included in the exposure-efficacy analysis. The final lymphocyte and tumour size models 
indicated that a dosage regimen of 400 mg QD in patients with CLL/SLL maximises the probability of a 
typical subject achieving ORR at > 80%. The model also indicated that decreasing the dose to 200 mg 
would not relevantly affect response rate.

Figure 7: Probability of achieving OR and CR/Cri versus average venetoclax concentration: 
orginal versus updated 
A repeated measures logistic regression analysis between exposure and objective response in CLL/SLL 
was conducted at the time of Phase 2 dose selection. This analysis predicted a difference in ORR 
between the 400 mg and 600 mg doses at early time points; however, the difference was negligible 
after 24 weeks of treatment. Contrary to the exposure-effect model, the regression analysis led to the 
conclusion that a dose of 200 mg may be somewhat less effective than 400 mg. 
The exposure-safety relationship was evaluated for infection and neutropenia. Logistic regression 
analyses of the adverse events (Grade  3) of neutropenia and infection indicated that higher average 
venetoclax concentrations were associated with a decreased probability of the adverse event. It is 
hypothesised that the effect is driven by improving disease treatment. Therefore, the safety endpoints 
of  Grade 3 neutropenia and infection are not dose limiting. 
In dose-response studies, a MTD was not defined (doses up to 1200 mg), but data suggested an 
increase in adverse events at doses higher than 400 mg, although it was not dose-limiting. The risk for 
tumour lysis syndrome during the titration phase has been observed to be increased at increased 
doses/exposure. 
Exposure QT Response Analyses 
The central tendency, categorical and exposure-response analyses components of this QT/QTc 
assessment were determined in Study M12-175 (R&D/15/0254) where electrocardiogram (ECG) 
measurements were collected in triplicate at multiple time-matched points (2, 4, 6 and 8 hours) at 
baseline (prior to the first dose administration) and at steady state (at 3, 6 or 7 weeks of dose 
administration) in subjects with R/R CLL and NHL. Steady-state doses of venetoclax in this study 
ranged from 100 to 1200 mg QD. Blood samples for plasma venetoclax assay were collected after each 
steady-state time-matched triplicate ECG collection. 
A total of 176 subjects had at least one QTcF measurement at baseline or steady state, while 147 
subjects had at least one steady-state QTcF measurement. Of the 518 steady-state QTcF

measurements from 147 subjects, 84.3% (437 out of 518), 9.7% (50 out of 518), and 6.0% (31 out of 
518) of the QTcF measurements were from the average of triplicate, duplicate, and single readings, 
respectively. 
Plotting of the QTcF versus venetoclax concentrations indicated no relationship over the range of 
concentrations observed up to the 1200 mg QD dose. 
Figure 8: QTcF Versus Venetoclax Plasma Concentrations (Observed) 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Venetoclax is very lipophilic and practically insoluble in aqueous solutions. Venetoclax tablets are 
formulated to enable adequate in vivo absorption. Although absolute bioavailability has not been 
determined, the absorption of venetoclax under normal conditions is considered sufficiently well-
established through biopharmaceutic and mass-balance studies.  
Absorption of venetoclax under fasting conditions is low. Food increased bioavailability by 3- to 5-fold 
depending on fat content. Venetoclax has been administered with food in all clinical efficacy/safety 
studies. Administration with a low-fat meal may be considered the standard condition based on the 
recommendation given in the efficacy and safety studies to take venetoclax with breakfast. The 40-
50% higher exposure with a high-fat meal as compared with a low-fat meal is likely not clinically 
relevant, and it is therefore acceptable not to define the fat content of the concomitant meal in the 
SmPC.   
Venetoclax has pH dependent solubility, with somewhat higher solubility at pH 1 and 12, and lower 
solubility at pH 4 and 7. However, the solubility is still extremely low over the whole pH range. Given 
that venetoclax is to be administered with food, i.e. at a state with somewhat increased gastric pH and 
where solubilising agents in the food and gastric fluids likely increases bioavailability, acid-reducing 
agents are not expected to affect venetoclax bioavailability. 
The elimination of venetoclax is sufficiently well characterised. Venetoclax is almost exclusively 
hepatically eliminated. Based on the elimination mechanisms (CYP3A4 metabolism, transport via Pgp 
and BCRP), the relevant in vivo interaction studies have been performed, i.e. with ketoconazole 
(CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor) and rifampicin (PXR inducer and Pgp inhibitor).   
Venetoclax is a Pgp and a BCRP substrate. Venetoclax is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. 
Co-administration of a 600 mg single dose of rifampin, a P-gp inhibitor, in 11 healthy subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 47/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased venetoclax Cmax by 106% and AUC∞ by 78%. A Pgp inhibitor increased venetoclax AUC by 
about 80%. It is therefore recommended to avoid Pgp and BCRP inhibitors during the titration phase. 
During the maintenance phase, patients should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicity. 
A single, major plasma metabolite, M27 was identified. As M27 does not contribute to the 
pharmacological activity of venetoclax, its elimination or its potential to be affected by drug-drug 
interactions as a victim do not need to be thoroughly investigated.  
Co-administration of 400 mg once daily ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, for 
7 days in 11 patients increased venetoclax Cmax by 2.3-fold and AUC∞ by 6.4-fold. Co-administration of 
venetoclax with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase venetoclax AUC by on average 
5.8- to 7.8-fold. (see SmPC section 4.5). As venetoclax has a long half-life, administration of 
ketoconazole on a BID schedule is predicted to give a larger effect.  
The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, posaconazole) during the titration phase is contraindicated in the SmPC, (see 
section SmPC 4.3 and 4.5) due to the risk for TLS. When titration is completed, an at least 4-fold dose 
reduction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and a 2-fold reduction with moderate inhibitors is possible. In 
order to demonstrate that the proposed dose recommendations will maintain adequate venetoclax 
exposure for CYP3A4 inhibitors of different potency, PBPK simulations were performed. The results of 
these simulations indicate that the proposed 2-fold dose reduction at concomitant administration of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and 4-fold reduction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors will not lead to under-
exposure of venetoclax in comparison with the exposure at 400 mg without inhibition, and will not lead 
to higher exposure than with the 1200 mg dose administered in the multiple-dose ascending dose 
study. The PBPK model appeared to adequately describe venetoclax pharmacokinetics, and the 
observed effect of ketoconazole 400 mg daily was well predicted. The effect of a 200 mg BID dosing of 
ketoconazole was estimated to be a 7.8-fold increase in venetoclax AUC, in line BID ketoconazole this 
being a worst case for a victim with a long half-life.  
Grapefruit products, Seville oranges, and starfruit (carambola) should be avoided during treatment 
with venetoclax as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A (see SmPC section 4.5). 
The potential of venetoclax and its major metabolite M27 to act as perpetrators in drug-drug 
interactions was thoroughly investigated in vitro in accordance with the EMA interaction guideline. The 
in vitro evaluation was in general sufficient, except that in vitro induction data for CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 
are considered inconclusive, and new in vitro studies will be performed as PAMs (see RMP).  
Venetoclax was identified as an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and UGT1A1. M27 inhibited 
CYP2C9 and UGT1A1. An in vivo interaction study with warfarin, however, demonstrated a very small 
effect on S- and R-warfarin, and the effect is considered unlikely to be mediated by CYP2C9 inhibition 
as also R-warfarin was affected, which suggests it may be an effect on Pgp. For most substrates, the 
observed increase in AUC would not be considered clinically relevant but it is agreed that a warning of 
INR monitoring should be given if warfarin is co-administered with venetoclax. Overall it is accepted 
that venetoclax is unlikely to cause clinically relevant increases in the exposure of CYP2C9 substrates. 
As IC50 values for CYP2C8 and UGT1A1 were in the same range as for CYP2C9, relevant in vivo 
inhibition of these enzymes would also not be expected.    
Venetoclax was identified as an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Both venetoclax and M27 inhibited 
OATP1B1. Caution is recommended at concomitant treatment with substrates of these transporters 
e.g. anti-coagulants. For narrow-therapeutic index substrates of P-gp or BCRP that are sensitive to 
inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract (dabigatran is presently the most well-known example), dosing 
should be staggered in relation to venetoclax administration (see SmPC section 4.5.). Several anti-
Assessment report

coagulants used such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban are substrates for P-glycoprotein and, thus, 
venetoclax may increase their exposure (see discussion on clinical safety). If a statin (OATP substrate) 
is used concomitantly with venetoclax, close monitoring of statin-related toxicity is recommended. 
Co-administration of 600 mg once daily rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, for 13 days in 10 healthy 
subjects decreased venetoclax Cmax by 42% and AUC∞ by 71%. Concomitant use of Venetoclax with 
strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., 
bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided. Alternative treatments with less 
CYP3A induction should be considered. Preparations containing St John's wort are contraindicated 
during treatment with venetoclax, as efficacy may be reduced (see section 4.3).  
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, gastric acid reducing agents (e.g., proton pump 
inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) do not affect venetoclax bioavailability (see SmPC 
section 4.5). Co-administration of bile acid sequestrants with venetoclax is not recommended as this 
may reduce the absorption of venetoclax. If a bile acid sequestrant is to be co-administered with 
venetoclax, the SmPC for the bile acid sequestrant should be followed to reduce the risk for an 
interaction, and venetoclax should be administered at least 4-6 hours after the sequestrant. 
In a drug-drug interaction study in three healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of 400 mg 
venetoclax with 5 mg warfarin resulted in an 18% to 28% increase in Cmax and AUC∞ of R-warfarin and 
S-warfarin. Because venetoclax was not dosed to steady state, it is recommended that the 
international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored closely in patients receiving warfarin (see SmPC 
section 4.5). 
The effect of different intrinsic and some extrinsic factors on venetoclax pharmacokinetics was 
evaluated by population pharmacokinetic analysis. The population pharmacokinetic model appeared to 
perform adequately, although the evaluation of some co-variate effects was hampered by limitations in 
the dataset, as further discussed below. There was no effect of mild to moderate renal impairment on 
venetoclax clearance, as expected based on the minimal renal excretion of venetoclax. As severe renal 
impairment might impact elimination of hepatically eliminated drugs and given the increased TLS risk 
at renal impairment, the SmPC advices that venetoclax should be administered to patients with severe 
renal impairment only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk, and that patients should be more 
closely monitored for toxicity. 
There was no effect of mild hepatic impairment on venetoclax CL/F. The population pharmacokinetic 
analysis included only 7 and one patient with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, 
and no conclusions can be drawn for these populations. As Venetoclax is hepatically eliminated an 
increased exposure could be expected in patients with metabolic impairment of the liver. A study in 
hepatic impairment is planned; the SmPC recommends close monitoring of patients with moderate 
impairment, while venetoclax treatment is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment, given the risk of significantly increased exposure and thereby increased risk of TLS.  
Based on non-clinical data in mice, venetoclax is not classified as a teratogen, but showed clear 
embryo-foetal toxicity. Due to maternal toxicity there were no exposure margins to clinical exposure in 
these studies and it cannot be completely excluded that venetoclax is a human teratogen at higher 
exposures. The SmPC (section 4.6.) recommends that female patients of childbearing potential should 
avoid pregnancy and further advices that as it is currently unknown whether venetoclax may reduce 
the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, women using hormonal contraceptives should add a 
barrier method. Furthermore, an in vivo interaction study with an oral contraceptive will be performed 
post-authorisation (see RMP).

Additional in vitro and in vivo interaction data including in vitro induction data on CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 
and a drug-interaction study on the effect of venetoclax on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives 
will be provided as part of post-approval measures (see RMP).

Treatments 
Throughout the course of the study, substantial revisions were made to the dosing plan and study 
conduct of both the dose-escalation cohorts and the expanded safety cohorts of Arm A (CLL/SLL) and 
Arm B (NHL) in response to the observed risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS).  
After the initial 3 CLL subjects in this study experienced laboratory TLS per Cairo Bishop definition 
laboratory following the first venetoclax dose of 100 or 200 mg. Amendment 3 reduced the initial dose 
of venetoclax for CLL SLL to 50 mg, established a 2-3 week ramp up period with weekly dose 
escalation to the designated cohort dose set the maximum daily dose at 1200 mg and implemented 
hydration and uric acid control for all subjects.  
In December 2012, 2 fatal events occurred in the setting of TLS in CLL subjects who had failed multiple 
prior therapies and had a high tumour burden. This resulted in a Sponsor-initiated partial clinical hold 
for the venetoclax program. 
In May 2013, the venetoclax clinical program was restarted under Amendment 8 (i.e., post-May 2013) 
with more gradual ramp-up over 5 weeks, starting at 20 mg with final dose of 400 mg in CLL/SLL 
subjects, enhanced monitoring, and TLS prophylaxis measures, and additional guidance for 
investigators. Amendment 9 implemented a 20 mg initial dose for CLL/SLL subjects for 1 full week. 
The actual doses administered during dose-escalation in Study M12-175 Arm A are shown in the Table 
below. (Additional modifications due to TLS were made starting with Amendment 8 [post-May 2013]; 
however, these modifications affected only the safety expansion cohort.) 
Table 13:  Venetoclax Dose Escalation in Study M12-175, Arm A (Subjects with CLL/SLL) 
A minimum of 3 subjects were enrolled per cohort. Escalation of venetoclax to the next designated 
cohort dose level in each arm was to proceed if all assigned subjects at a dose level completed the 
ramp-up period plus 3 weeks at the designated cohort dose without experiencing a DLT.  
Safety Expansion Cohorts 
Once the MTD/RPTD was declared, a cohort of approximately 60 additional CLL/SLL subjects in Arm A 
were to be enrolled in expanded safety portion. The dosing schedule for the expanded safety portion of 
the study (based on Amendment 10; post-May 2013) is depicted in the Figure below.

Results 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The CLL/SLL study subjects were heavily pre-treated with a mean of 3.5 prior therapies (range 1-10). 
Mean age was 64.8 years (range 25-86 y) and 97% had ECOG 0-1. A substantial proportion of 
subjects had CLL with risk factors for poor outcome (eg bulky disease ≥5 cm, fludarabine refractory, 
unmutated IGHV). Subjects were classified in 3 categories based on the risk for developing TLS as 
defined by tumour burden and ALC. TLS risk category was medium for or high for ~75%. 
Certain CLL/SLL subjects in this study dose reduced based on events occurring in other subjects in the 
venetoclax program. Following 2 fatal events in the setting of TLS, all doses were reduced to 600 mg 
or less. Seven subjects in the 800 mg cohort were reduced to 600 mg and 2 subjects in the 1200 mg 
cohort received the cohort dose for 10 and 17 days only.

Data Sets Analyzed 
All 116 CLL/SLL subjects enrolled in the study received at least 1 dose of venetoclax and are included 
in the efficacy and safety analyses.  
Efficacy results 
Table 15: Summary of Response – CLL/SLL Subjects (per Investigator assessment) 
Data cut-off 10 Feb 2015 
Per investigator assessment, ORR was somewhat less in dose cohorts <400 mg than in cohorts ≥400 
mg, whereas only a very small difference was seen between cohorts on 400 mg and >400 mg. Note 
the reported high CR/Cri rate in the >400 mg cohort. 
Time to response 
Figure 10: Cumulative Response Over Time – CLL/SLL Subjects 
The time to first response was usually <2 months whereas time to CR varies between ~4 and ~16 
months.

IRC Assessment of Efficacy Endpoints 
Overall Response Rate 
A total of 59 subjects with CLL and 8 subjects with SLL received 400 mg venetoclax.  Fifty-seven 
subjects with R/R CLL who had received 400 mg of venetoclax were reviewed by the IRC.  Two 
subjects with CLL did not have complete baseline computed tomography (CT) assessments and were 
not reviewed by the IRC.  The 8 subjects with SLL were not included in the IRC review to maintain a 
more homogenous population. These exclusions seem acceptable.

Duration of ORR and PFS (10 Feb 2015) 
For the 57-subject sample of R/R CLL subjects, the median DOR and PFS per investigator assessment 
are 40.1 months (95% CI:  24.0, NA) and 40.4 months (95% CI:  17.1, NA), respectively.  Current 
estimates for DOR and PFS at 12 months are 95.1% and 80.2%. 
Examination of Subgroups based on Investigator Assessments 
Response was observed across all subgroups in analyses of ORR, CR, and PR among CLL/SLL subjects. 
Notably, responses were seen in patients with poor prognostic features, including 17p deletion, 
fludarabine-refractory, and IGVH unmutated. Exploratory analysis of TP53 gene status also suggests a 
response in subjects with the mutated gene.

In addition, five study subjects had failed treatment with B-cell receptor inhibitors (i.e., ibrutinib and 
idelalisib for 2 subject each duvelisib for 1 subject) at study enrollment. All 5 had discontinued the 
study at the time of the data cutoff for this interim CSR. Best response, as assessed by their 
investigator, was PR for 2 subjects who had been treated with venetoclax for 184 and 421 days and 
stable disease for 2 subjects who had been treated with venetoclax for 56 and 170 days. 
Results for subjects who previously failed therapy with BCR inhibitors should be compared (or 
combined) with those of study Study M14-032. 
Efficacy correlation to dose level (Data cut-off 10 Feb 2015) 
A greater proportion of subjects treated in cohorts assigned daily doses of 400 mg (82.1%) or higher 
(85.2%) achieved ORR, as compared to subjects assigned to treatment with a dose below 400 mg/day 
(63.6%). The estimated proportion of subjects with PFS at 12 months was 72.5% (95% CI: 58.0, 
82.8) in the dose escalation cohorts. Subjects in dose cohorts less than 400 mg had lower estimated 
12 month PFS (58.4%) than those in 400 mg (81.8%) or higher dose cohorts (77.1%).  
Please also refer to the apparent exposure activity relationship discussed in the PD section above.  
Safety 
Adverse events were slightly higher at doses higher than 400 mg but no clear pattern was seen. 
The 3 most common adverse events of all grades reported for CLL/SLL subjects, irrespective of 
severity or relationship to study drug, were diarrhoea (49.1%), nausea (47.4%), and neutropenia 
(44.8%). Diarrhea was reported in 48.3% (29/60) of subjects in the 400 mg safety expansion cohort 
and 46.7% to 60.0% of subjects at doses of 600 mg to 1200 mg. The incidence of nausea was 40.0% 
(24/60) in the 400 mg safety expansion cohort and 53.3% to 71.4% in the dose cohorts of 600 mg or 
higher. Neutropenia was observed in 41.7% (25/60) of subjects in 400 mg safety expansion cohort 
and ≥ 57.1% of subjects in dose cohorts of 600 mg or higher. 
Dose-Limiting Toxicity – CLL/SLL 
Of 116 CLL/SLL subjects enrolled in 7 dose-escalation cohorts and 1 safety expansion cohort, 6 
experienced DLTs within the evaluable period for dose escalation purposes and 3 subjects had dose 
limiting events beyond that time frame. 
Three subjects enrolled in cohort 1, at starting doses of both 100 and 200 mg, all had a DLT event of 
grade 3 TLS, and 2 of the events were considered serious. The events resolved in all 3 subjects. Two 
additional subjects experienced DLTs of TLS during dose escalation: one subject in cohort 4 (300 mg) 
who experienced a serious grade 4 TLS event accompanied by acute renal failure on Day 2 ( 50 mg 
starting dose); and, one subject in cohort 8 who experienced sudden death in the setting of TLS at the 
maximum designated cohort dose (1200 mg). Additionally, 1 subject (Subject 155, cohort 6 at 50 mg) 
experienced a DLT of nonserious, grade 4 neutropenia during dose escalation. 
Since < 33% of subjects enrolled at each dose level after cohort 1 experienced a DLT dose escalation 
of the designated cohort dose in CLL/SLL subjects was continued in this study. 
Three subjects had dose limiting events after the dose escalation period. One subject 120 (cohort 5 at 
400 mg) had grade 2 thrombocytopenia which progressed to grade 4 and led to discontinuation of 
venetoclax, one subject in the same cohort experienced grade 2 vomiting and grade 3 muscle spasms 
that led to venetoclax dose interruption and reduction, and one subject in the safety expansion cohort 
experienced grade 3 neutropenia at 300 mg that did not result in any change to venetoclax dosing.

MTD was not determined for either arm A or B based on criteria prospectively defined in the protocol. 
The RPTD for CLL/SLL subjects was determined to be 400 mg based on data from all CLL/SLL subjects 
in the dose escalation cohorts.

Treatments 
There were 2 treatment groups: the main cohort and the safety expansion cohort. All subjects were to 
be dosed at the final dose of 400 mg following a Lead-In Period to evaluate a stepwise dose escalation.  
Venetoclax was administered orally once daily (QD), continuously. To mitigate the risk for TLS, a Lead-
In Period (up to 5 weeks) was employed to evaluate a step-wise dose escalation. All subjects were 
admitted to the hospital and began the Lead-In Period with an initial test dose of 20 mg venetoclax on 
Week 1 Day 1. If no significant findings occurred within 24 hours, then a test dose of 50 mg was 
administered on Week 1 Day 2 followed by 50 mg venetoclax QD for 5 days (Week 1 Day 3 through 
Day 7). If significant findings occurred within 24 hours of the initial test dose of 20 mg venetoclax on 
Week 1 Day 1, the 20 mg dose was maintained for 1 week prior to dose escalation to 50 mg on Week 
2 Days 1 to 7. After a week at 50 mg, the following dose escalation proceeded with weekly increases in 
dose: → 100 mg → 200 mg → 400 mg, as tolerated. Subjects may continue to receive venetoclax for 
up to 2 years following the date of the last subject enrolled, provided they continue to tolerate drug 
and have no evidence of disease progression.

Figure 13: Dosing schematic-Main cohort.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the main cohort was to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL harbouring the 17p deletion. Efficacy was measured by ORR, 
the proportion of subjects with an overall response (CR + CRi + nPR + PR) per the NCI-WG guidelines 
as assessed by the IRC in the first 70 subjects enrolled treated in the main cohort. 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the CR rate, PR rate, DOR, PFS, EFS, time to progression 
(TTP), time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, OS, and percent of subjects who moved 
on to stem cell transplant. The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or 
refractory CLL harbouring 17p deletion was also evaluated. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy analysis: 
The assessment of ORR by IRC was performed once after 107 subjects had completed the 36 week 
disease assessment, had progressed prior to the 36-week disease assessment, discontinued study 
drug for any reason, or after all treated subjects had discontinued venetoclax, whichever was earlier.  
Non-responders: Among these 70 subjects, those who had not achieved a CR, CRi, nPR, or confirmed 
PR prior to the data cut-off date.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include all 107 subjects for ORR [NB. regarded as primary endpoint 
in this overview], complete remission rate (CR + CRi), partial remission rate (nPR + PR), duration of 
overall response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS), time to progression 
(TTP), time to 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), overall survival (OS), and percent of 
subjects who move on to stem cell transplant. 
Duration of overall response DoR will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response 
(CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) by either CT scan or physical exam determination to the earliest recurrence PD 
or death per the IRC assessment. For subjects who have a PR before CR, CRi, or nPR in subsequent 
visits the DoR is computed from the earliest PR. For subjects who never experience response the

subject’s data will not be included in the analysis. Duration of overall response will be analysed by 
Kaplan Meier methodology.  
Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
The additional exploratory efficacy analyses will be performed on the All Treated Subjects in the Main 
Cohort analysis set and All Treated Subjects in the Main Cohort with 17p Deletion CLL analysis set. 
Descriptions of the additional efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
Time to next anti-leukaemia treatment will be defined as the number of days from the date of the first 
dose to the date of first dose of new non protocol anti-leukaemia therapy (NPT) or death from any 
cause.  
The rate of MRD response in subjects will be defined as the proportion of subjects who had MRD 
negative status. Only subjects with an MRD assessment negative or positive as required per protocol 
will be used in calculation of MRD response rate, indeterminate samples will not be included in the 
denominator for the calculation.  
Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome measures will include the MD Anderson Symptom 
Inventory (MDASI) measure of patient reported symptoms   the EORTC QLQ C30 and QLQ CLL16 and 
the EQ-5D-5L, and EQ 5D VAS. 
Sample Size 
Approximately 100 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the main cohort to assess the safety and 
efficacy of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL harbouring the 17p deletion. With this 
sample size, if an adverse event occurs at a rate of 2%, then the probability of observing at least 1 
event in a trial with 100 subjects is 86%. 
Performing the efficacy analyses at 70 subjects provides at least 90% power (at two-sided alpha of 
5%) to reject the null hypothesis of 40% ORR in favor of an alternative hypothesis of 60% ORR. 
Concerning safety signals detection with this sample size, if an AE occurred at a rate of 2%, then the 
probability of observing at least 1 event in a trial with 100 subjects was 86%. Assuming a peak 
enrolment rate of 0.11 subjects/site/month, it was anticipated that approximately 100 subjects would 
be enrolled during the 14-month enrolment phase. For the safety expansion cohort, an additional 50 
subjects will be enrolled to assess the modifications made to the initial dosing of venetoclax for the 
management of TLS. With this sample size, if a TLS event occurs at a rate of 2%, then the probability 
of observing at least 1 event in this cohort of 50 subjects is 64%. 
The primary assessment of the efficacy of venetoclax was to occur around Month 19, at which time 70 
subjects would have had their 36-week disease assessment. Performing the efficacy analyses at 70 
subjects provided at least 90% power (at 2-sided alpha of 5%) to reject the null hypothesis of 40% 
ORR in favour of an alternative hypothesis of 60% ORR. 
Randomisation

Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics were planned. For binary endpoints (e.g. ORR), 95%-CI were calculated 
according to the Pearson-Clopper method. Kaplan-Meier methods were used for time-to-event 
endpoints (such as PFS, OS). 
All disease progression was included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was 
taking the study drug or had previously discontinued the study drug. If the subject did not experience 
disease progression or death, then the data were censored at the date of last disease assessment. 
Data for subjects who received non-protocol anti-CLL therapy prior to disease progression were 
censored at the last disease assessment prior to receiving non-protocol therapy. Data for subjects 
without any disease assessments performed after the Baseline Visit were censored at the time of 
enrollment plus 1 day. 
Only one test Multiplicity (primary analysis for ORR in the main cohort efficacy) was planned. 
Descriptive statistics and 95%-CI for all other endpoints were included. As interim analysis one safety 
review by independent data monitoring committee when 20 patients had completed at least 12 week of 
treatment.

Recruitment 
A total of 151 subjects were enrolled in the study as of the data cut-off date for this interim report (30 
April 2015). Of the 151 subjects enrolled in the study, 145 subjects started treatment prior to (or on) 
26 March 2015 and therefore had the opportunity to complete the 5 week lead-in period and were 
evaluable for the purposes of this report, including all 107 subjects in the main cohort and 38/50 
subjects in the safety expansion cohort. In the main cohort, 104 subjects achieved the target dose of 
400 mg, and 3 subjects discontinued venetoclax prior to completing the lead-in period.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations were defined in accordance with ICH guidelines. In addition, TLS prophylaxis and 
management deviations were assessed. All deviations were assessed for impact on analyses and data 
integrity.  
There was a total of 114 protocol deviations (PDs), of which 50 were classified as medically significant, 
noted in the main cohort. None of the PDs were considered to have affected the study outcome or 
interpretation of the study results or conclusions.  
Protocol Changes 
Three protocol amendments were issued during the conduct of this study as of the study cut-off date.  
No subjects were enrolled under the original protocol. Protocol Amendment 1 was dated 10 May 2013. 
A total of 107 subjects (comprising the main cohort) were enrolled under this Amendment. The main 
purpose of the amendment was to implement more stringent measures (referred to as "Post May 
2013" measures) for prophylaxis and management of TLS. 
Protocol Amendment 2 was dated 25 July 2014. A total of 36 subjects (all in the safety expansion 
cohort) were enrolled under this Amendment. The revised measures included a starting dose of 20 mg 
and 5 step ramp-up to 400 mg, less stringent TLS prophylaxis and monitoring (referred to as "Current" 
measures) depending on the risk category, and the addition of a safety expansion cohort to evaluate 
these measures. 
Protocol Amendment 3 was dated 19 December 2014. The main purpose of the amendment was to 
include subjects in the study with previously untreated CLL harboring 17p deletion in the Safety 
Expansion Cohort. As of the data cutoff date for this interim report, total of 2 subjects (in the safety 
expansion cohort) were enrolled under this Amendment [and are not included in the efficacy analysis]. 
Baseline data 
The mean age was 66y and male patients constituted ~63 %. The vast majority of the study 
population (~97%) were white, and approx. 65% were from the EU. Mean/median number of prior 
therapies was 2.8/2.

Table 16: Disease Stage at Diagnosis and Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Score – All 
Treated Subjects 
At diagnosis, most subjects had limited (Rai/Binet-) disease stage (meaning enlarged lymph nodes 
and/or enlargement of spleen and/or liver, but near normal RBC and platelet counts) and ~92% had 
ECOG ≤1. Considering the mean time since diagnosis of ~7.5 years (see below), the respective stage 
at baseline would have been more relevant.  
Although Rai and Binet staging has not been presented at study initiation, the assessment of the 
tumour burden indicates that patients with a variety of disease staging and progressive disease are 
included. The TLS risk categories, as defined by tumour burden and total lymphocytes, classified 
23.4% subjects in low, 38% subjects in intermediate and 38.7% of the subjects of the main cohort in 
the high risk category.

Chromosomal Aberrations  
All subjects enrolled in the study were to harbour the 17p deletion. Due to an error at the study site, 1 
subject was enrolled who did not meet the 17p deletion assay cut-off of > 7%. The subject's data are 
included in all analyses.

Baseline Prognostic Factors – All Treated Subjects 
Among other negative prognostic factors, it is noted that 28.3% were reported as being fludarabine 
refractory per investigator assessment (37% in the main cohort) and 49% had one or more nodes ≥5 
cm. Mean and median time since diagnosis >7years and >6 years, respectively, perhaps illustrating 
that del17p often is a manifestation of advanced and late stage disease in CLL. 
The significance of these additional risk factors in CLL with 17pdel is not known. 
Baseline Assessment of Tumour Lysis Syndrome Risk 
Subjects were classified in 3 protocol-defined risk categories based on the risk for developing TLS as 
defined by tumour burden and total lymphocytes.

Numbers analysed 
For this interim report, the efficacy analyses were performed for subjects in the main cohort only (total 
efficacy population, n=107). Efficacy analyses for all subjects, including the safety expansion cohort, 
will be included in the final report for this study. 
Further updates of study results will provide data from up to approx. 50 additional patients (from the 
safety expansion cohort) and will increase data maturity.

After prolonged follow-up, CR/CRi rates was increased whilst ORR remained stable. 
Among the subjects achieving PR by IRC, 16 subjects showed absence of leukemic infiltrate in their 
bone marrow based on morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (30 April 2015 cut-off).  
Differences in ORR between the IRC and Investigator (30 April 2015 cut-off) 
The ORR rate by IRC assessment was higher than that by investigator assessment. Primarily, this was 
a result of differences in interpretation of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, which may have been 
affected by subjectivity in the assessment of the CT scans. 
Deep responses (subjects with CR/CRi and nPR) by IRC assessment were lower than those by 
investigator assessment. Primarily, this was a result of differences in radiologic assessments (PR 
versus CR) based mainly on target lesion measurements. Of note, there were 10 subjects who were 
assessed as having complete remission by the study investigator, who were not considered CR by IRC 
assessment. In these 10 subjects, the PR assessments by the IRC were mainly based on node size > 
15 mm. Of note, 2 of the 10 subjects were found to be MRD negative. 
Differences in response assessments between the IRC and investigator were observed in 31 subjects. 
These differences showed no clear tendency of being more or less positive in either category but went 
in both directions, i.e. sometimes the IRC assessed PR where the investigator assessed SD, and 
sometimes the investigator assessed CR where IC assessed PR.

Time to First Response 
First response (CR or PR) was observed at the first visit for most subjects in the main cohort with a 
median of 0.8 months (range: 0.1 to 8.1). A notable increase in the CR/CRi rate was observed at the 
disease assessment at 36 weeks (8.3 months) consistently with the protocol-required radiologic 
assessment as well as with bone marrow assessment, in eligible subjects. 
Figure 14: Cumulative Response Rate Over Time – IRC Assessment (Data cut-off 30 April 
2015) 
Time to 50% Reduction in Absolute Lymphocyte Count 
Eighty-seven (81.3%) subjects had lymphocytosis at baseline, defined as the presence of absolute 
lymphocyte count of > 5 × 109/L and only these subjects were assessed for this secondary objective. 
A total of 85 of 87 subjects had a 50% reduction in ALC, occurring on average within the first week of 
treatment (median 0.3 months [range: 0.1 to 0.9 months]). Notably, 53 subjects had their lymphocyte 
count normalized to < 4 × 109/L by Week 4. Of the 2 subjects not having a reduction in ALC of 50%, 1 
subject withdrew consent after 1 day of treatment with venetoclax, and 1 subject, with a stable 
disease, progressed after Week 20. 
Hence, the vast majority of patients had a 50% reduction in ALC, usually within the first couple of 
weeks. This is different from the pattern generally seen with BCRi in CLL, where many patients 
respond with an increase in ALC (or with a sustained elevation of ALC in spite of response in lymph 
nodes and other manifestations).

Figure 15: Kaplan-Meier plot of Overall survival (main cohort) 
A total of 17 (15.9%) subjects in the main cohort died. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion of 
subjects surviving at 12 months was 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%, 91.9%). 
Subjects Who Received a Stem Cell Transplant 
Three (3; 2.8%, all responders) of subjects in the main cohort subsequently received a stem cell 
transplant. At the time of the data cut of the interim report, all 3 subjects remained disease free after 
approximately 2 months, 1 month and 11 months from the transplant, respectively.

The TTNT was defined as the number of days from the date of the first dose of venetoclax to the date 
of first dose of a new anti-CLL treatment or death from any cause. A total of 25 (23.4%) subjects in 
the main cohort were identified as receiving a new anti-CLL treatment. 
Patient-reported health related QoL measures 
Patient-reported health related QoL measures were identified as exploratory efficacy endpoints for this 
study, including MDASI, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, EQ-5D-5L, and EQ VAS.  
Subjects seemed to do better in symptoms and QoL on venetoclax during the course of the study 
compared to their baseline value. No net negative and significant changes were noted.

Study M14-032 (data cut off 10 February 2016) 
Study M14-032 is an open-label, 2-arm, multi-centre study evaluating 400 mg of venetoclax in 
subjects with CLL who relapsed after or were refractory to treatment with either ibrutinib or idelalisib.   
Arm A was targeted to enrol 40 subjects after receiving ibrutinib and Arm B was to enrol 20 subjects 
after receiving idelalisib treatment.   
In Arm A, 26/43 (60.4%) subjects had refractory disease and 13 (30.2%) had progression after 
discontinuation of ibrutinib for toxicity.   
In Arm B, 6/21 (28.6%) had refractory disease and 11 (52.3%) had progression after discontinuation 
of idelalisib for toxicity.

Discontinuation of previous ibrutinib or idelalisib treatment due to toxicity was predominantly for 
diarrhoea and pulmonary events in both arms.  Median time on ibrutinib was 17 months (range:  1 – 
56) and the median time on idelalisib was 8 months (range:  1 – 27).   
Median age for subjects in Arm A is 66 (range:  48 – 80) with 26 (60.5%) subjects being ≥ 65 years of 
age.  In Arm B the median age is 68 (range:  56 – 85) while 15 (71.4%) subjects are ≥ 65 years of 
age.  Nine of the 64 subjects have received both ibrutinib and idelalisib; 4 of these subjects were 
enrolled into Arm A and 5 into Arm B based on their most recent treatment.

Venetoclax in combination with rituximab Study M13-365 
Study M13-365 is an ongoing dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of venetoclax 
in combination with rituximab in subjects with relapsed CLL or SLL.  The primary objectives were to 
assess the safety profile and to determine the MTD, RPTD, tolerability, and optimal lead-in period of 
venetoclax when administered in combination with rituximab.  The secondary objectives were to assess 
the pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of the combination.  MRD in the bone marrow and blood were 
exploratory endpoints. 
ORR for venetoclax in combination with rituximab was ~80%, which seems more or less the same as 
for venetoclax monotherapy, however, CR+CRi in ~35%, seems to indicate a higher proportion of deep 
responses.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Four uncontrolled studies provide the basis to support efficacy of venetoclax in adult patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutations.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the pivotal M13-982, 106 patients (of a total 107) with del17p-CLL were enrolled in the main cohort. 
The median duration of treatment was 13 months (main cohort). In addition there is a safety 
expansion cohort (n=51). Study M14-032 is of major interest as the target population, subjects with 
CLL who have failed therapy with BCRi, constitutes a population with unmet medical need. Altogether 
64 subjects were enrolled for a median study duration of 8 months. Study M12-175, is the key 
supportive study comprising 116 patients with R/R CLL. In this study, 36/116 had known high-risk 
criterion of del17p/TP53-mutation and 67/116 were treated with the [target] dose 400 mg. In addition, 
5 of the enrolled subjects had failed previous therapy with BCR-inhibitors. Median duration of exposure 
was 19 months in the 400 mg cohort (n=67). Finally, study M13-365 is an ongoing Phase 1b study 
evaluating venetoclax in combination with rituximab in subjects with relapsed CLL or SLL. As of the 
data cut-off, a total of 49 subjects were enrolled and the median time on study was 10.3 months. 
All the included studies in this MAA are single-arm which represents a weakness. In accordance with 
the CHMP scientific advice (January 2014) based on preliminary results from study M12-175 and lack 
of approved therapeutic alternatives at the time of the study design/scientific advice, the single arm 
study M13-982 would be sufficient on the assumption of a substantial increase in CR or of the rate of 
patients achieving MRD negativity would support the application, durability of responses and an 
acceptable safety profile. 
The selection of response rate (ORR) as a primary endpoint seems acceptable in high-risk R/R CLL 
patients, provided responses are of reasonable durability and an acceptable safety profile. Prior to the 
introduction of BCRi, the prognosis for 17p del CLL patients has been poor due to the limited efficacy of 
immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy-based regimens. In the pivotal study M13-982, a subject 
was considered compliant if 80% of the assigned dose was taken over the course of the study, unless 
otherwise directed by the principal investigator. No subject was less than 80% compliant over the 
course of the study. Of the 107 subjects in the main cohort, 104 subjects achieved the target dose of 
400 mg (3 subjects discontinued venetoclax prior to completing the lead-in period). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and overall safety in Study M12 -175 at doses from 150 to 
1200 mg venetoclax for CLL/SLL subjects led to the selection of 400 mg as the dose to explore further  
in the CLL/SLL safety expansion cohort of this study. No MTD was reached or defined.  
In the main cohort (107) subjects of the pivotal study M13-982, the majority were male (65.4%), 
white (97.2%) and ≥ 65 years of age (57.0%, median 67 years, range 37 to 85).  The median number 
of prior therapies was 2 (range 1 – 10).  All but one of the subjects had 17p deletion and the majority 
of subjects had additional high risk features of disease:  18.7% of subjects were ≥ 75 years of age; 
81.1% (30 of 37) were IGVH unmutated; 37.4% (34 of 91) were refractory to fludarabine; 53.3% (57 
of 107) had a lymph node > 5 cm; and 50.5% (54 of 107) had an ALC ≥ 25 × 109/L.   
This study met its primary endpoint of ORR demonstrating that treatment of subjects with R/R CLL in 
the presence of 17p deletion with venetoclax 400 mg once daily resulted in a significantly higher ORR 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 81/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than the null hypothesis of 40% (P value < 0.001).  In original submission, the IRC assessed ORR was 
79.4% in the total main cohort (n=107; investigator assessed ORR was 73.8%).  The IRC assessed CR 
rate was 7.5% and the investigator assessed CR rate was 15.9%.  There were 9 subjects assessed as 
CR by the investigator but assessed as PR by the IRC (7 due to residual target lymph node size 
> 1.5 cm, ranging from 1.6 to 3.4 cm).  
Overall, differences in response assessments between the IRC and investigator were observed in 31 
subjects. These differences showed no clear tendency of being more or less positive in either category 
but went in both directions and considering the rather complex procedure of response assessment, this 
seems expected and acceptable. Updated results with data cut-off 29 January 2016 show essentially 
similar results including confirmation of ORR in the SE cohort (n=51).  
First response was observed at the first visit for most subjects in the main cohort with a median of 0.8 
months, whereas achievement of CR/CRi took considerably longer with a median of ~8-10 months.  
Progression-free survival at 12 months per investigator assessment was 75% in the main cohort and 
80% in the SE cohort. Three subjects received a stem cell transplant after achieving best responses of 
CR, PR, and PR, respectively, by IRC assessment. 
Survival data are still very immature with a total of 17 (15.9%) subjects who died in the main cohort. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion of subjects surviving at 12 months was 86.7% (30 April 
2015).  
MRD was an exploratory endpoint in study M13-982. No detectable MRD (sensitivity < 10–4) was 
reported in the peripheral blood of 28 of 63 tested subjects. In the main cohort, MRD negativity in 
peripheral blood and on therapy was about 26%, i.e. higher than the complete remission rates. In 
most cases this is explained by residual lymph nodes slightly larger than accepted according to CR 
criteria. No obvious subgroup-related differences were reported.    
With respect to subgroup analyses there are no conspicuous findings in reasonably large subgroups. 
Patient-reported health related QoL measures were identified as exploratory efficacy endpoints for this 
study, including MDASI, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, EQ-5D-5L, and EQ VAS. The different 
measures of patient reported QoL generally indicated a mild to moderate improvement in the various 
dimensions and no net negative and significant changes were noted. However, results need to be 
interpreted with caution as they are observed exploratory endpoints in this single arm study.  
Therefore, the above results from pivotal study M13-982 support efficacy of venetoclax in the first part 
of the indication: 
 “Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or 
have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor”.  
The totality of data, including non-clinical data, shows that the activity of venetoclax is not influenced 
by del 17p/TP53 status. Prior failure on BCRi or CIT seems not to influence the efficacy of venetoclax 
to any major degree, however the number of patients in different subgroups is small. The reported 
results of study M14-032, in subjects who failed previous treatment with BCR-inhibitors the IRC 
assessed ORR was 30/43 after ibrutinib and 10/21 after idelalisib failure and corresponding PFS data at 
6 months were 81% and 88%. In the update (10 June 2016) similar response rates (60-70%) were 
shown irrespective of del17p/TP53 status and prior therapy idelalisib or ibrutinib.  Since the majority of 
patients without p17/TP53 mutation have received both prior chemoimmunotherapy and a BCRi this 
should be reflected in the indication as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 82/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell 
receptor pathway inhibitor as the proportion of progression-free at 12 months was about 80% 
and median PFS was more than 2 years.   
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Data on post-BCRi therapy are limited, therefore confirmation of efficacy is needed. This patient 
population is expected to increase as more CLL patients will (eventually) progress after BCRi 
treatment. A comparative clinical study in this setting is likely not to be feasible within an acceptable 
time frame considering that the BCRis have only been rather recently approved relative to the long 
PFS/DoR of these products as this is a requirement for a conditional approval. Sixty more patients are 
planned for enrolment in study M14-032; the extension of this supportive study will form the basis of 
additional efficacy data needed.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In overall submitted studies showed a consistent efficacy in terms of ORR in both patient populations 
(with or without 17p del/ TP53 mutation) and demonstrate the activity of venetoclax.  With a median 
exposure of around one year, efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in the studied populations of R/R and 
high-risk (del17p) CLL seems unequivocal with ORR and PFS at 1 year of 75-80 %. Responses included 
CR in approximately 18%, overall efficacy appears consistent in relevant subgroups.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA:  
In order to further confirm the efficacy of venetoclax  in CLL patients who progressed on or after 
idelalisib or ibrutinib where patient numbers were low and because of the short follow up time the MAH 
should provide further data on safety and data on efficacy for study M14-032 of venetoclax in chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia patients relapsed after or refractory to treatment with B-cell receptor signalling 
pathway inhibitor therapy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The overall clinical safety evaluation of venetoclax for the treatment of CLL included a total of 553 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of venetoclax.  This safety population includes 289 subjects with 
CLL treated with venetoclax monotherapy, 88 subjects with CLL treated with venetoclax combination 
therapy, 106 subjects with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with venetoclax monotherapy, and 
70 subjects from relevant pharmacology studies (12 NHL subjects and 58 healthy subjects), as 
summarized below. 
The venetoclax monotherapy studies in CLL include 1 pivotal and 2 key supportive ongoing clinical 
studies: 
 
Pivotal Study M13-982 in subjects with R/R or previously untreated CLL harboring the 17p del; 
N = 145 (400 mg dose) 
  Key supportive Study M12-175 evaluated multiple dose levels of venetoclax in subjects with 
R/R CLL (Arm A); N = 116 (67 subjects at 400 mg dose) 
  Supportive Study M14-032 in subjects with CLL that was R/R to ibrutinib or idelalisib 
treatment; N = 28 (400 mg dose) 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 83/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety results from pivotal Study M13-982 in 17p del CLL subjects were largely similar to the 
safety results in Study M12-175 in R/R CLL (Arm A) and in Study M14 032 in BCRi failures, described 
further in individual clinical study reports (CSRs).  Also, the safety results in the pooled dataset of all 
subjects who received 400 mg venetoclax in these 3 studies were largely similar to the individual study 
results.  Thus, the safety evaluation of 400 mg QD venetoclax monotherapy is based on the pooled 
dataset of all subjects who received 400 mg venetoclax in the 3 monotherapy studies listed above (N 
= 289 subjects for all doses; N = 240 for the 400 mg dose). 
The 3 ongoing venetoclax combination therapy studies listed below provide supportive safety data. 
  Study M13-365 evaluated venetoclax + rituximab in subjects with relapsed CLL (N = 49) (Data 
cutoff date:  15 December 2014). 
  Study GO28440 evaluated venetoclax + bendamustine/rituximab (BR) in subjects with R/R or 
previously untreated CLL (N = 19) (Data cutoff date:  28 November 2014). 
  Study GP28331 evaluated venetoclax + obinutuzumab in subjects with R/R or previously 
untreated CLL (N = 20) (Data cutoff date:  28 November 2014). 
One monotherapy substudy in subjects with NHL (Arm B of Study M12-175; N = 106) provides 
comparative data to help differentiate CLL-related AEs and risk factors from those attributable to 
venetoclax.  It also provides supportive safety data with higher dose levels of venetoclax, as well as a 
food effect substudy. 
A total of 6 completed clinical pharmacology studies, listed below, provide additional supportive safety 
data (N = 75 [includes 5 who did not receive venetoclax]): 
The data from studies with combination therapy, monotherapy in NHL, and pharmacology studies are 
summarized separately and are not pooled.  
All studies were conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines, and the ethical concepts of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
In the response to the D120 LoI, a general safety update was provided for all subjects receiving 400 
mg venetoclax (All 400 mg Analysis Set, N = 296).  In addition, updated safety data for 17p del 
subjects receiving 400 mg venetoclax (N = 188) and subjects with previous BCRi failures receiving 400 
mg venetoclax (N = 94) was also provided.

Note:  Duration of exposure includes the dose ramp-up period during which subjects received venetoclax at 
dosages less than the target dose. 
With the updated data cut the median follow-up for venetoclax increased by 1 month to 11.4 months 
(previously 10.3 months), with approximately 100 subjects who have received venetoclax for over 1 
year. Longer exposure (up to 2 years) is available for at least 28 subjects. 
In the 17p del group, close to 100 patients have been treated for 1 year. The safety profile is likely to 
be similar in the BCRi failure population and as the safety profiles are clearly different comparing 
BCRi:s and venetoclax making cross-intolerance a likely non-issue.

Adverse Events Over Time 
Adverse events were evaluated by the first onset and by prevalence over time. In general, TEAEs had 
the highest incidence and prevalence during initiation of therapy (Days 1-90).  
A graphical illustration of the incidence and prevalence of the most frequent TEAEs was provided. Apart 
from second primary tumour, the incidence of all other AE.s was highest the first month (similar first 
and second month for “autoimmune events”). Note that there were no new hepatic events after month 
2, whilst the prevalence appears to stay stable at 1.2% after month 3. The prevalence of grade 1-2 
infections is rather stable over time whilst grade 3-4 events gradually decreases as does the incidence. 
All this is essentially as expected.

Other Significant Adverse Events and AESI 
Tumour lysis syndrome (updated cut-off) 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), resulting from the on target pharmacologic effect of venetoclax, was 
identified as a risk early in the first-in-human Study M12-175 based on significant reductions in 
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and responses in lymph nodes within the first 4 to 24 hours of 
dosing. Significant findings and adjustments to the clinical program regarding prevention of TLS is 
extensively described in module 2.7.4 (Section 2.1.5.1) and include ramp-up dosing and TLS 
prevention. 
Since May 2014, a total of 122 subjects have received venetoclax following the Current Amendment, 
which aligns the prophylactic measures with the patients' relative risk.  Adverse events of TLS were 
reported in 4 (3.3%) subjects (table below).

Hypocalcemia:  preferred terms of hypocalcaemia and blood calcium decreased 
The risk for TLS is considerably reduced by the installed prophylactic measures, but TLS grade 3 does 
occur at an incidence of about 3%.  
Neutropenia (updated cut-off) 
Neutropenia is a common toxicity in patients with R/R CLL who have received multiple prior 
chemotherapy/immunotherapies, reported in 40% to 60% of patients. 
All neutropenia AESIs reported in the All 400 mg Analysis Set are summarized in the table below; 
neutropenia AESIs were reported in 148/296 (50.0%) of subjects, and the reported preferred terms 
were neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, and febrile neutropenia. Several subjects had pre-
existing neutropenia prior to entering the study.

d. 
Includes preferred terms of neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, febrile neutropenia, agranulocytosis, 
neutropenic infection, and neutropenic sepsis. 
[In 106 NHL patients included in study M12-175 Arm B, grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in ~10%]. 
Neutropenia was found not to be dose-limiting based on exposure-safety analysis. Still, among the 
dose escalation cohorts of study M12-175, neutropenia was observed in 41.7% (25/60) of subjects in 
400 mg safety expansion cohort and ≥ 57.1% of subjects in dose cohorts of 600 mg or higher. 
Laboratory data combined with the exposure-response analyses suggest that if venetoclax contributes 
to neutropenia clinically, it is not dose-dependent across the range of doses that demonstrate clinical 
efficacy (i.e., 150 to 1200 mg).

c.  Subjects with R/R CLL who previously failed BCRi therapy; Studies M13-982, M12-175 Arm A, and M14-

In the original submission, the most common preferred terms among infection SAEs were pneumonia 
(5.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1.3%). 
For comparison, infection AESIs in the NHL population were reported in only 36% (38/106) of subjects, 
with grade ≥ 3 events in 10% (11/106) of subjects, and serious events in 10% (11/106) of subjects. 
Serious infection is included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
The search for opportunistic infections was comprehensive and 5 serious events were identified in 4 
individuals. All subjects were previously treated with fludarabine. One subject had grade3 neutropenia, 
but this was a case of disseminated herpes (with a history of zoster). There were three cases of 
pneumocystis and one of pulmonary aspergillosis, thereof one with grade 1-2 neutropenia. Events 
were diagnosed (TTO) day 67 to 672. Event rates and distribution of opportunistic infections are 
inconspicuous, but obviously it cannot be excluded that treatment with venetoclax contributed, but the 
signal is considered weak and prior fludarabine therapy and the underlying condition are more likely to 
be causative. 
Second Primary Malignancy 
Due to underlying immune impairment, patients with CLL are at an increased risk of second 
malignancies, defined as a new primary cancer in a subject with a history of cancer (Dasanu 2007, 
Streu 2014). 
No signal related to second primary malignancies was identified at the time of the MAA submission, 
Additional data, including data on a total of 296 subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set, which included 
188 subjects with 17p deletion, were submitted; long-term data for up to 43.7 months (median 
exposure 11.4 months), with 100 subjects with at least 1 year of follow-up and 28 subjects with at 
least 2 years of follow-up.

Autoimmune events 
Autoimmunity is of common occurrence in the CLL population.  In the All Doses Analysis Set, 
autoimmune hemolytic anaemia (AIHA) occurred in 4.5% (13/289) of subjects and immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) occurred in 3.5% (10/289) of subjects, whereas the incidence in NHL 
subjects (Arm B of Study M12-175) was 0.9% (1/106) for AIHA and 0% (0/106) for ITP. 
Autoimmune hemolytic anaemia was reported in 5.4% (13/240) of subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis 
Set, and the events were grade 3 (n = 7) or 4 (n = 3) for the majority of these subjects; 2.9% 
(7/240) of subjects experienced serious events. The events of AIHA led to venetoclax dose interruption 
in 3 subjects, venetoclax dose reduction in 1 subject, and venetoclax discontinuation in 2 subjects. 
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura was reported in 2.9% (7/240) of subjects in the All 400 mg 
Analysis Set, and the events were grade 3 (n = 1) or 4 (n = 5) for the majority of these subjects 
(6/7); 0.8% (2/240) of subjects experienced serious events. The events of ITP led to venetoclax dose 
interruption in 4 subjects and venetoclax dose reduction in 1 subject. No events led to venetoclax 
discontinuation. 
Autoimmune events encountered in CLL comprise a wide spectrum of diagnoses, some of which may 
also precede the CLL diagnosis. A broad search for autoimmune events and co-morbidities (including 
non-haematological events and pre-existing conditions) was performed. Reported events are those 
expected in CLL and there were, e.g. no reported events of thyroid disorders, events typically seen in 
cases of autoimmunity related to therapy. 
Transformation/Richter's Syndrome 
Of the 289 subjects in the R/R CLL All Doses Analysis Set, 29 subjects were discontinued because of 
progression of disease that included Richter's syndrome: 15 in Study M12-175, 13 in Study M13-982, 
and 1 in Study M14-032.  
The possibility of ongoing transformation to Richter's syndrome prior to initiating venetoclax cannot be 
ruled out in 13 of the 29 subjects where Richter's syndrome was reported within 6 months of initiating 
venetoclax therapy.  In general, the majority of the subjects had multiple risk factors (e.g., R/R 
disease, 17p del, multiple prior cytotoxic therapies, prior fludarabine-based therapy). Updated data on 
Richter’s transformation further reveal that among the 345 subjects with CLL treated with any dose of 
venetoclax monotherapy and included in the updated safety analyses, 37 cases were identified to have 
RT in course of CLL disease progression.  The current incidence of RT in studies with venetoclax 
monotherapy is 10.7%; the incidence of RT among non-responders (20.7%) was higher than among 
subjects with documented clinical response by investigator (6.9%).  The mean onset of RT from 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 95/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
venetoclax initiation was 290.5 (range:  9 – 700) days, with 14 subjects diagnosed with RT within 6 
months after first dose of venetoclax.  
Gastrointestinal Disorders (SOC) 
Diarrhea occurred in 35.4% (85/240) of subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set (however, grade 3 AEs 
occurred in only 2 subjects and no grade 4 events were reported.  The majority of diarrhoea AEs were 
manageable with no treatment or with standard medical care.  Few subjects required a dose reduction 
(n = 2) or dose interruption (n = 3) of venetoclax.  Diarrhoea was serious in 1 subject. Only 1 subject 
discontinued venetoclax because of diarrhoea (Subject 134 due to grade 2 diarrhoea and vomiting). 
Nausea occurred in 33.3% (80/240) of subjects and vomiting occurred in 14.6% (35/240) subjects in 
the All 400 mg Analysis Set, however, grade 3 AEs occurred in only 2 subjects each and no grade 4 
events were reported.  The majority of nausea and vomiting AEs were manageable with no treatment 
or standard medical care.  Serious AEs were reported in 1 subject for vomiting. Only 1 subject 
discontinued venetoclax because of these events (Subject 134 due to grade 2 diarrhoea and vomiting). 
The prevalence of diarrhoea decreased from 25.4% (61/240) during the first 90 days of venetoclax 
treatment to approximately 10% – 14% during subsequent 90-day intervals. For nausea, the 
prevalence decreased from 26.3% during the first 90 days of treatment to approximately 14% – 17% 
during subsequent 90-day intervals.  For vomiting, the prevalence decreased from 10.0% during the 
first 90 days of treatment to approximately 2% to 5% during subsequent 90-day intervals. 
Two subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set had SAEs of small intestinal obstruction that was fatal for 
one subject, and resolved within 4 days for the other subject. The investigator indicated alternative 
etiologies of umbilical hernia for the fatal case and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) for the 
resolved case. 
Hence, gastrointestinal events were largely of grade ≤2 and gradually became less frequent during 
treatment. Tolerance may be different in individuals with pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions eg 
IBD. 
Cardiac Disorders (SOC) 
Consistent with the age of the study population (median of 66 years), 60.8% of subjects in the All 400 
mg Analysis Set had medical histories of diseases or conditions reported in the cardiovascular system 
prior to starting venetoclax. A total of 8 subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set experienced SAEs in 
the cardiac disorders SOC, including cardiopulmonary failure for 1 subject. The cardiopulmonary failure 
occurred 7 days after the last dose of venetoclax and was fatal.  The SAEs for the remaining 7 subjects 
were assessed by the investigator as grade 2 or 3 and none resulted in venetoclax discontinuation or 
dose reduction.  All SAEs were assessed by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of 
being related to venetoclax.  
In the All 400 mg Analysis Set, TEAEs of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter were reported in a total of 10 
subjects:  9/240 for atrial fibrillation and 1/240 for atrial flutter. Nine of the 10 subjects were ≥ 65 
years of age (range:  64 to 78 years). Three of the 4 atrial fibrillation SAEs were transient and 
resolved. For the remaining SAE of atrial fibrillation, the investigator attributed this event to the 
subject having to stop taking amiodarone to participate in the study. The SAE of atrial flutter was 
ongoing as of the data cutoff date.  
No cases of torsade de pointes were identified.  A total of 7 subjects had TEAEs reported in the SMQ of 
torsade de pointes/QTc prolongation:  sudden death in 1 subject and syncope in 6 subjects. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 96/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sudden death was in the setting of tumour lysis syndrome. All 6 subjects with syncope had other 
plausible reasons for syncope unrelated to prolonged QT interval. 
Overall, the number and scope of cardiac events (including atrial fibrillation) recorded in the venetoclax 
studies appear to be within the expected range for the study population. Further it was clarified that 
there were eight cardiac events in in 111 subjects without known history of cardiac disorders and the 
events were diverse; 1 case of tachycardia and 1 case of palpitation in subjects below 60 years of age. 
Bleeding Adverse Events (Haemorrhages SMQ) 
Adverse events in the haemorrhages SMQ (narrow search) were reported in 13.8% (33/240) of 
subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set and the events were grade 3 (n = 5) or 4 (n = 4) for 9 
subjects.  These events were serious in 6 subjects, all considered to have no reasonable possible 
relationship to venetoclax by the investigator.  The events in the haemorrhages SMQ led to venetoclax 
dose interruption in 4 subjects, venetoclax dose reduction in 1 subject, and venetoclax discontinuation 
in 1 subject. 
A total of 42% (101/240) subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set were receiving anticoagulant and/or 
antiplatelet medications (except warfarin which was exclusionary). 
Of the 9 subjects with grade ≥ 3 events, 6 subjects had ITP. Of the 6 subjects with ITP, only 1 subject 
with grade 4 ITP had a concurrent grade 2 AE of bleeding diathesis; both events were assessed by 
investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to venetoclax. The grade ≥3 events for 
the remaining 3 subjects (3/240) were all considered to have no reasonable possible relationship to 
venetoclax by the investigator (1 event of fatal haemorrhagic stroke concurrent with serious deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), 1 gastric ulcer haemorrhage attributed to massive infiltration of gastric mucosa by 
aggressive lymphoma (Richter's transformation), and 1 upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in setting 
of reflex esophagitis). 
The incidence of AEs in the hemorrhage SMQ (narrow search) in the All 400 mg Analysis Set was 
comparable among subjects on concurrent anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications (16.8% 
[17/101]) compared with subjects not on concurrent anticoagulants (11.5% [16/139]). 
Overall, the incidence of haemorrhage appears to be within the expected range for a similar 
population. A somewhat higher incidence in subjects with ITP and concomitant anticoagulant therapy 
would also be expected. 
Hepatobiliary Disorders (SOC) and DILI 
Adverse events in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC occurred in 4.2% (10/240) of subjects  in the All 
400 mg Analysis Set, and the events were grade 1 or 2 for the majority of these subjects (6/10).  
There was one SAE of hepatic function abnormal in one Study M13-982.  This SAE was fatal and 
occurred in an 85-year-old male subject with history of prostate cancer and pre-existing elevations in 
LFT parameters. This event was considered to have no reasonable possibility of being related to 
venetoclax.  
A medical review of all subjects with events retrieved using the drug-related hepatic disorders SMQ 
(narrow) in the All 400 mg Analysis Set did not identify any subject meeting Hy's law. 
One case reported under the preferred term of DILI was reported in Study GO27878.  This study is a 
study in B-cell NHL and DLBCL (ongoing and not included in this Summary of Clinical Safety). The 
subject was taking concomitant duloxetine for depression. The subject had a negative response to 
dechallenge and other possible etiological factors were present according to the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 97/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reported cases of hepatobiliary disorders or suspected DILI were either mild or observed in 
contexts with other possible aetiological factors present (progressive disease, multiorgan failure with or 
without TLS, or other therapeutic agents). It was further clarified that there were altogether 2 cases of 
possible DILI in the full studies program (in about 1500), one case each in DLBC and AML. Due to 
concomitant treatment causality in relation to venetoclax can hardly be properly assessed. 
Deaths (original cut-off) and other Serious adverse events (updated cut-off) 
A total of 7 deaths, out of the 18 deaths in the All 400 mg Analysis Set (N = 240), had causes other 
than disease progression, as assessed by the investigator. Upon medical review, they were consistent 
with the elderly patient population with multiple risk factors including advanced CLL, and were all 
considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related or probably not 
related to study drug (see table above). 
Three additional deaths were reported in other dose groups, and 1 of these deaths had a cause other 
than disease progression.  Therefore, across all 289 subjects included in the R/R CLL pooled analysis 
sets, there were 8 deaths (out of the 21 total deaths reported from TEAEs) that had causes other than 
disease progression. 
Deaths in Other Supportive Studies 
In the venetoclax combination therapy studies in R/R CLL (Studies M13-365, GO28440, and GP28331), 
a total of 2 fatal TEAEs were reported, both in Study M13-365 (one subject due to malignant neoplasm 
progression and one subject due to hyperkalaemia in the setting of TLS). 
A total of 8 fatal TEAEs were reported in subjects with NHL who received venetoclax monotherapy in 
Study M12-175 (Arm B):  malignant neoplasm progression for 7 subjects and respiratory failure (with 
alternative etiology of mantle cell lymphoma) for 1 subject. 
No deaths were reported in the Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies.

and febrile neutropenia (5.1%).  All malignant neoplasm progression events were related to 
progression of the primary disease of CLL/SLL. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Shifts of haematology parameters to grade 3/4 were frequently seen but generally seem to have 
abated at last/final visit. 
Neutropenia Decreases Over Time 
The risk of neutropenia with venetoclax treatment decreases over time, as observed in the All 400 mg 
Analysis set.  Clinical laboratory results for mean neutrophil counts over time showed a decrease from 
3.9 × 109/L at baseline to 2.2 × 109/L at Week 4, and then partially recovered, stabilizing between 2.6 
and 2.9 × 109/L from Week 28 throughout the study as shown in Figure 16 here below.

Mean ANC-values appear more or less stationary following an initial decrease at week 4. This is despite 
the use of G-CSF in a significant proportion of subjects (eg 21.2% for Days 91 – 180).  
Anaemia and haemoglobin decreased 
The first onset of anaemia (or haemoglobin decreased) AEs was greatest during the first 90 days of 
venetoclax treatment (26.7% of subjects, which represents 64 of the 70 subjects with events), and 
decreased to 1.4% during the next 90 days and was no more than 3% for each 90-day interval 
thereafter. Similarly, the prevalence of anaemia (or related preferred terms) was greatest during the 
first 90 days of treatment and decreased during each 90-day interval thereafter.

The mean haemoglobin values in the All 400 mg Analysis Set that show a decrease of approximately 8 
g/L at Week 4 that recovered to baseline levels by Week 8, and then subsequently increased to levels 
that were approximately  10 – 15 g/L above the baseline mean from Week 16 throughout the study. 
While anaemia was seen during treatment with venetoclax, it was considered not study drug-related 
rather due to background disease and/or multiple prior therapies, as the incidences decrease over 
time.  
Thrombocytopenia or Platelet Count Decreased  
The first onset of thrombocytopenia (or platelet count decreased) was greatest (17.9% of subjects, 
which represents 43 of the 52 subjects with events) during the first 90 days of venetoclax treatment, 
and decreased to 1.8% during the next 90 days and to no more than 2.7% for each 90-day interval 
thereafter. Similarly, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia (or related preferred terms) was greatest 
during the first 90 days of treatment and decreased during each 90-day interval thereafter.

Analysis Set)

As for anaemia, while thrombocytopenia was seen during treatment with venetoclax, this was not 
study drug-related rather due to background disease and/or multiple prior therapies and the incidences 
of these AEs decrease over time.  
Lymphopenia or Lymphocyte Count Decreased 
A decrease in lymphocyte count is the desired on-target effect of venetoclax.  Lymphopenia occurs due 
to the on-target effect of venetoclax.  Lymphopenia (or lymphocyte count decreased) occurred in 4.6% 
(11/240) of subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set, and the events were grade 3 (n = 4) or grade 4 (n 
= 3) for the majority of subjects (7/11).  No event was serious, and no event led to venetoclax 
discontinuation, dose interruption, or dose reduction.  Additionally, no trend for opportunistic infection 
was observed. Lymphocyte depletion was seen in non-clinical studies with venetoclax. Changes in 
subpopulations were addressed and there was an apparent early decrease in T-cells reaching a new set 
point not later than at 12 weeks and on.

Clinical Chemistry 
In the All 400 mg Analysis Set (N = 240), the clinical chemistry results for subjects with grade 0 – 2 
baseline values shifted to grade 3/4 for one or more assessment in ≥ 5% of subjects for low sodium 
(6.3%), low potassium (8.4%), high potassium (5.1%), low calcium (13.8%), low inorganic phosphate 
(11.3%), and high glucose (6.4%).  At the Final assessment, clinical chemistry variables with shifts to 
grade 3/4 for > 2% of subjects were low calcium (2.1%) and high glucose (3.0%).  Of the 7 subjects 
with high glucose at the final assessment, 5 subjects had a history of diabetes. The occurrence of 
hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia was explained as more likely to be related to TLS or the 
measures to prevent TLS rather than a pharmacological effect of venetoclax treatment.

According to the MAA, the overall incidence of TEAEs, grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, and SAEs was similar across 
age groups.  Among subjects in the All 400 mg analysis set, TEAEs that were reported in at least 10% 
of subjects < 65 years of age and ≥ 2-fold the rate in subjects ≥ 65 years or vice versa were 
constipation (7.8% < 65 years, 18.1% > 65 years), hyperphosphatemia (20.6% < 65 years, 10.1% ≥ 
65 years), hypophosphatemia (10.8% < 65 years, 3.6% ≥ 65 years), and pruritus (10.8% < 65 years, 
5.1% ≥ 65 years).  Treatment-emergent AEs that were reported in at least 10% of subjects < 75 
years of age and ≥ 2-fold the rate in subjects ≥ 75 years of age or vice versa were vertigo (3.5% < 75 
years, 10.0% ≥ 75 years), fall (3.0% < 75 years, 10.0% ≥ 75 years), fluid overload (2.0% < 75 
years, 10.0% ≥ 75 years), squamous cell carcinoma of skin (3.5% < 75 years, 17.5% ≥ 75 years), 
and insomnia (2.0% < 75 years, 10.0% ≥ 75 years).

Renal function: In the All 400 mg Analysis Set, the incidence of these events was lower in subjects 
with normal renal function, with a rate of 77.8% for any AE compared with ≥ 98% for subjects with 
mild or moderate impairment; 57.8% for grade ≥ 3 AEs compared with > 71% for mild or moderate 
impairment; and 28.9% for SAEs compared with 40.2% for mild impairment and 52.9% for moderate 
impairment. TEAEs that were more frequent in subjects with mild/moderate renal impairment included 
thrombocytopenia (8.9% normal, 21.6% mild, 17.6% moderate), vomiting (6.7% normal, 11.8% mild, 
20.0% moderate), oedema peripheral (6.7% normal, 13.7% mild, 7.1% moderate), neutrophil count 
decreased (0% normal, 13.7% mild, 3.5% moderate), back pain (4.4% normal, 13.7% mild, 
9.4% moderate), urinary tract infection (2.2% normal, 4.9% mild, 10.6% moderate), squamous cell 
carcinoma of skin (2.2% normal, 3.9% mild, 10.6% moderate). Further, the statistical tables included 
in the original MAA were updated to include all subjects with normal renal function in the numerators in 
the analyses of subjects with normal renal function in the 400 mg dose groups, changing the adverse 
event rates.

After correction of the numerator there is no longer a “signal” related to renal impairment. The SPC 
and the RMP have been updated as regards renal and hepatic impairment. 
Hepatic impairment: No subject had severe hepatic impairment.  The overall incidence of TEAEs, 
grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, and SAEs was similar between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects 
with mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Conclusions are limited as only 5 subjects in the All 400 mg 
Analysis Set had moderate hepatic impairment.

Events of malignant neoplasm progression were related to progression of the primary disease of CLL and are 
excluded. 
Adverse event preferred terms that led to discontinuation in ≥ 2 subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis 
Set were autoimmune hemolytic anaemia (n = 2) and thrombocytopenia (n = 2).   
The cumulative risk for discontinuation not related to PD is about 12% after about 600 days, 
relatedness not taken into account. This is compatible with a well-tolerated compound in the treatment 
of R/R CLL. In none of the cases, discontinuation was preceded by dose reduction and dose reduction 
was preceded by interruption in 17 of 35 cases. 
Adverse Events Leading to Venetoclax Interruption 
Interruptions in venetoclax dosing due to TEAEs occurred in 32.9% of subjects in the All 400 mg 
Analysis Set, and AEs that led to an interruption in ≥ 2% of subjects were neutropenia (3.8%), febrile 
neutropenia (2.5%), hyperphosphatemia (2.9%), TLS (2.5%), thrombocytopenia (2.1%), nausea 
(2.1%), vomiting (2.1%), pyrexia (2.1%), and blood creatinine increased (2.1%). 
Dose interruptions were rather frequent at ~30%.  
Adverse Events Leading to Venetoclax Dose Reduction 
Any TEAE leading to venetoclax dose reduction was seen in ~10%. The AEs that led to a venetoclax 
dose reduction in ≥ 2 subjects were neutropenia (n = 7), febrile neutropenia (n = 3), 
thrombocytopenia (n = 3), diarrhea (n = 2), vomiting (n = 2), and pneumonia (n = 2). 
The dosing status for the 23 subjects who had their venetoclax dose reduced due to AEs in the All 400 
mg Analysis Set is summarized as follows: 
  8 subjects subsequently had their dose increased to 400 mg. 
  7 subjects continued dosing at a reduced dose as of the data cutoff date (at 50 – 400 mg). 
  7 subjects continued at a reduced dose until they discontinued venetoclax. 
  1 subject had no dose reduction as of the data cutoff date, but an AE with an onset prior to the 
data cutoff date led to a dose reduction, and is therefore counted in ISS:  Subject 12452 in 
Study M13-982 dose reduced to 300 mg after the data cutoff date. 
Dose interruptions due to AEs occurred in approximately 1/3rd of the study population. In the pivotal 
study, 11/107 (10.2%) subjects experienced events that lead to dose interruption of > 28 days (range 
29 to 141 days). Despite prolonged dose interruptions in these 11 subjects, ORR remained 79.4%, by 
IRC (see clinical efficacy part). This suggests that dose interruptions, even prolonged to >28 days, do 
not seem to have a major impact on outcome.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall clinical safety evaluation of venetoclax included a total of 553 subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of venetoclax.  This safety population includes 289 subjects with CLL treated with 
venetoclax monotherapy, 88 subjects with CLL treated with venetoclax combination therapy, 106 
subjects with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with venetoclax monotherapy, and 70 subjects 
from relevant pharmacology studies (12 NHL subjects and 58 healthy subjects).  
The safety results from the 3 monotherapy CLL studies (pivotal Study M13-982 and supportive studies 
M12-175 and M14-032) were largely similar. The safety evaluation of 400 mg QD venetoclax 
monotherapy is based on the pooled dataset of all subjects who received 400 mg venetoclax in the 3 
monotherapy studies listed above (N = 289 subjects for all doses; N = 240 for the 400 mg dose). The 
monotherapy substudy in subjects with NHL (Arm B of Study M12-175; N = 106) provides comparative 
data to help differentiate CLL-related AEs and risk factors from those attributable to venetoclax. 
In the venetoclax All 400 mg Analysis Set, TEAEs were reported in 98.3% of subjects, which included 
TEAEs coded to the preferred term of malignant neoplasm progression (13 subjects).  A medical review 
confirmed that all cases were related to progression of the primary disease, CLL.  When the preferred 
term of malignant neoplasm progression was excluded, the incidence of TEAEs was 72.9% for grade 
3/4 events, 43.8% for SAEs, 8.8% for TEAEs that led to venetoclax discontinuation, 32.9% for TEAEs 
that led to venetoclax dose interruption, 9.6% for AEs that led to venetoclax dose reduction, and 4.2% 
for fatal TEAEs. 
In the All 400 mg Analysis Set (n=240), TEAEs of any grade reported in ≥ 10% of subjects were 
neutropenia (39.2%), diarrhoea (35.4%), nausea (33.3%), anaemia (28.3%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (21.7%), fatigue (21.3%), thrombocytopenia (18.8%), pyrexia (15.8%), headache (15.0%), 
vomiting (14.6%), hyperphosphatemia (14.6%), constipation (13.8%), cough (13.3%), hypokalaemia 
(12.1%), oedema peripheral (10.8%), and back pain (10.0%). 
Adverse events with a reasonable possibility of being related to venetoclax that occurred in ≥ 10% of 
subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set were neutropenia (31.3%), nausea (23.3%), diarrhoea 
(18.8%), fatigue (12.9%), hyperphosphatemia (11.3%), thrombocytopenia (10.4%), and anaemia 
(10.4%). 
Adverse events grade 3/4 and reported in ≥ 5% of subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set were 
neutropenia (36.3%), anaemia (17.5%), thrombocytopenia (13.3%), neutrophil count decreased

(6.7%), febrile neutropenia (5.4%), and pneumonia (5.0%). Grade 3/4 infectious events (SOC) 
occurred in 17.5 % and Neoplasms (benign, malignant or unspecified) in 9.2%.  
Serious TEAEs were reported in 44.2% of subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set, and SAEs reported in 
at least 2% of subjects were malignant neoplasm progression (5.0%), pneumonia (5.0%), febrile 
neutropenia (4.6%), pyrexia (3.3%), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (2.9%), anaemia (2.1%), and 
TLS (2.1%). Serious infectious events (SOC) occurred in 17.9% and SOC Neoplasms (benign, 
malignant and unspecified) in 9.6%. 
Safety findings were broadly those expected in this study population and were generally consistent 
across subpopulations including All doses (n=289), All del17p (n=177), and BCRi-failures (n=46). 
In general, TEAEs had the highest incidence at initiation of therapy (Day 1-90) and abated thereafter.  
A total of 7 deaths, out of the 18 fatal TEAEs in the All 400 mg Analysis Set (N = 240), had causes 
other than disease progression, as assessed by the investigator.  The causes of death were variable 
and consistent with the patient population with multiple risk factors including advanced CLL, and were 
all considered by the investigator to be not related or probably not related to study drug. Three 
additional deaths were reported in other dose groups (venetoclax monotherapy), and 1 of these deaths 
was considered possibly related to study drug. This event was a sudden death that occurred in the 
setting of TLS at the highest dose (1200 mg) in the clinical development program prior to the 
implementation of the current dosing regimen and prophylactic measures.  
An additional 18 deaths from non-TEAEs (e.g., AE that was fatal had an onset > 30 days post 
venetoclax dosing) were reported in the monotherapy analysis sets in R/R CLL.  These deaths included 
14 due to disease progression and 4 subjects (all in Study M12-175) with additional causes and 
occurred between Post-Treatment Day 43 and 486. In the venetoclax combination therapy studies in 
R/R CLL (Studies M13-365, GO28440, and GP28331), a total of 2 fatal TEAEs were reported, both in 
Study M13-365. One of these was due to hyperkalaemia in the setting of TLS. 
A total of 8 fatal TEAEs were reported in subjects with NHL who received venetoclax monotherapy in 
Study M12-175 (Arm B) and were deemed secondary to malignant neoplasm progression for 7 
subjects. No deaths were reported in the Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies. 
Discontinuation of venetoclax due to TEAEs not related to disease progression occurred in 21/240 
(8.8%) of subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set and included 6 deaths. Dose interruptions due to 
TEAE were rather frequent at ~30% and dose reductions were performed in ~10%. About a third of 
the subjects who had a dose reduction due to AEs could subsequently increase the dose to 400 mg. In 
the main cohort of the pivotal study, 104/107 subjects achieved the target dose of 400 mg.  
Non-clinical studies had identified a maximum recommended starting dose of 200 mg dose. Following 
laboratory TLS in all 3 first subjects dosed with venetoclax 100 or 200 mg in the dose finding study 
M12-175, successive amendments have been implemented to minimize the risk for TLS. These 
measures include ramp-up dosing over 5 weeks, starting at 20 mg with final dose of 400 mg in 
CLL/SLL subjects, enhanced monitoring, TLS prophylaxis measures, and additional guidance for 
investigators and are adequately described in the SmPC (see section 4.8) and RMP. 
Of a total of 66 subjects enrolled following the Current Amendment, including 59 subjects who have 
completed the initial ramp-up period, TEAEs of TLS were reported in 6.1% (4/66) of subjects, with no 
events of Clinical TLS (significant impairment of kidney function, cardiac arrhythmia/sudden death, 
and/or seizure; please see above). It appears, then, that the current scheme for ramp-up dosing has 
been successful in mitigating the risk for TLS upon treatment of R/R CLL with venetoclax. TLS is an 
important identified risk in the proposed venetoclax RMP. Tumour lysis syndrome, including fatal

events, has occurred in patients with previously treated CLL with high tumour burden when treated 
with Venclyxto.  
The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including comorbidities. Patients with high 
tumour burden (e.g., any lymph node with a diameter ≥5 cm or high ALC ≥25 x 109/L) are at greater 
risk of TLS when initiating venetoclax. Reduced renal function (CrCl <80 mL/min) further increases the 
risk. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including 
hydration and anti-hyperuricaemics. Blood chemistries should be monitored and abnormalities 
managed promptly. Dosing should be interrupted if needed (see section 4.2). More intensive measures 
(intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalisation) should be employed as overall risk 
increases. The instructions for “Prevention of tumour lysis syndrome” should be followed (see 
section 4.2). Concomitant use of Venclyxto with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases 
venetoclax exposure and may increase the risk for TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.3). Also inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase venetoclax exposure (see 
section 4.5). 
In the All 400 mg Analysis Set, neutropenia AESIs were reported in 46.7% (112/240) of subjects. 
While neutropenia AESIs were grade ≥ 3 in 42.1% (101/240) of subjects, serious events occurred at a 
lower incidence of 5.8% (14/240).  In the monotherapy studies, mean ANC-values appear more or less 
stationary following an initial decrease at week 4. This is despite the use of G-CSF in a significant 
proportion of subjects. Neutropenia AESIs led to venetoclax dose interruption in 5.8% (14/240) of 
subjects, and venetoclax dose reduction in 4.2% (10/240) of subjects.  No subject discontinued 
venetoclax because of neutropenia AESIs. Neutropenia is an important identified risk with venetoclax 
administration (see RMP) and has been labelled as a common AE in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In the All 400 mg Analysis Set, infections were reported in 65.4% (157/240) of subjects and the 
events were grade 1 or 2 for the majority of these subjects (114/157; 72%). The most common (≥ 
5%) infection preferred terms were upper respiratory tract infection (21.7%), nasopharyngitis (9.2%), 
pneumonia (7.5%), and urinary tract infection (6.3%).  The most common preferred terms among 
grade 3/4 infections were pneumonia (5.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.3%), and cellulitis 
(1.3%). The infection AESIs were serious in 17.9% (43/240) of subjects, and led to venetoclax 
discontinuation in 0.8% (2/240) of subjects, interruption in 8.8% (21/240) of subjects, and dose 
reduction in 2.1% (5/240). Overall, the pattern of infectious AE recorded in the monotherapy studies 
seem to be expected in a study population of advanced CLL. Serious infection is included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
In the All 400 mg Analysis Set, second primary malignancy events were reported in 11.7% (28/240) of 
subjects.  Of these 28 subjects, 18 had non-melanoma skin cancers, and 10 had other second primary 
malignancies with no pattern to the specific malignancy type. In the RMP, carcinogenicity is included as 
missing information. A causal association of venetoclax to second primary malignancy cannot be 
established with the limited number of subjects exposed to venetoclax, and the relatively short follow-
up time.  
Autoimmunity is of common occurrence in the CLL population.  In the All Doses Analysis Set, 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) occurred in 4.5% (13/289) of subjects and immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) occurred in 3.5% (10/289) of subjects, whereas the incidence in NHL 
subjects (Arm B of Study M12-175) was 0.9% (1/106) for AIHA and 0% (0/106) for ITP. 
The events of AIHA led to venetoclax dose interruption in 3 subjects, venetoclax dose reduction in 1 
subject, and venetoclax discontinuation in 2 subjects. The events of ITP led to venetoclax dose

interruption in 4 subjects and venetoclax dose reduction in 1 subject. No events led to venetoclax 
discontinuation. 
According to the literature, disease progression due to Richter's syndrome, a clinical-pathologic 
transformation of CLL to an aggressive lymphoma, occurs over time in approximately 15% (5% – 
20%) of cases of CLL with the risk being higher among subjects with R/R CLL.  Per protocol, all 
subjects who showed clinical signs of progression due to Richter's syndrome were to be discontinued. 
Of the 289 subjects in the R/R CLL All Doses Analysis Set, 29 subjects were discontinued because of 
progression of disease that included Richter's syndrome: 15 in Study M12-175, 13 in Study M13-982, 
and 1 in Study M14-032. The possibility of ongoing transformation to Richter's syndrome prior to 
initiating venetoclax cannot be ruled out in 13 of the 29 subjects where Richter's syndrome was 
reported within 6 months of initiating venetoclax therapy. The possibility of ongoing transformation to 
Richter's syndrome prior to initiating venetoclax cannot be ruled out in 13 of the 29 subjects where 
Richter's syndrome was reported within 6 months of initiating venetoclax therapy.  Updated data on 
Richter’s transformation further reveal that among the 345 subjects with CLL treated with any dose of 
venetoclax monotherapy and included in the updated safety analyses, 37 cases were identified to have 
RT in course of CLL disease progression.  The current incidence of RT in studies with venetoclax 
monotherapy is 10.7%; the incidence of RT among non-responders (20.7%) was higher than among 
subjects with documented clinical response by investigator (6.9%).  The mean onset of RT from 
venetoclax initiation was 290.5 (range:  9 – 700) days, with 14 subjects diagnosed with RT within 6 
months after first dose of venetoclax. The majority of the subjects had multiple risk factors (e.g., R/R 
disease, 17p del, multiple prior cytotoxic therapies, prior fludarabine-based therapy). Considering the 
limited number of patient years in the venetoclax development program, the incidence of Richter’s 
syndrome appears high.  
Risk factors (number of prior lines, del17/TP53, fludarabine resistance etc.) associated with the risk of 
RT were enriched in the venetoclax studies and proactive diagnostics was made part of the study 
design. This makes historical comparisons hard to evaluate, but the transformation rate was clearly on 
the high side. In the majority of cases, RT is part of clonal evolution, but may also occur as a de novo 
DLBC lymphoma histologically indistinguishable from clonally evolved DLBCL, but with genetic 
characteristics dissimilar to the CLL clone, and uncommon transformations to Hodgkin. Whether risk 
factors for clonally related and unrelated are the same appears less well understood. Ongoing and 
projected studies in less advanced stages may shed further light onto this issue (see RMP). Although 
comparison of the incidence of Richter's syndrome among patients in the venetoclax program to 
available data in the literature are challenging, Richter’s transformation is considered as an important 
potential risk of treatment with venetoclax. 
Diarrhoea occurred in 35% of subjects in the All 400 mg subpopulation, nausea occurred in 33% of 
subjects and vomiting occurred in 14.6%. The majority of gastrointestinal AEs were grade ≤2 and 
manageable with no treatment or with standard medical care. Only 1 subject discontinued venetoclax 
because of diarrhoea (due to grade 2 diarrhoea and vomiting). A review of AEs over time indicates that 
the first onset occurred within the first 90 days of treatment for the majority of subjects who 
experienced gastrointestinal AEs. Tolerance may be different in individuals with pre-existing 
gastrointestinal conditions eg IBD. 
Consistent with the age of the study population (median of 66 years), 60.8% of subjects in the All 400 
mg Analysis Set had medical histories of diseases or conditions reported in the cardiovascular system 
prior to starting venetoclax. A total of 8 subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set experienced SAEs in 
the cardiac disorders SOC including 4 cases with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Overall, the number 
and scope of cardiac events appear to be within the expected range for the study population.

Adverse events in the haemorrhages SMQ (narrow search) were reported in 13.8% (33/240) of 
subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set and the events were grade 3 (n = 5) or 4 (n = 4) for 9 subjects 
(4%).  These events were serious in 6 subjects, all considered to have no reasonable possible 
relationship to venetoclax by the investigator. Of the 9 subjects with grade ≥ 3 events, 6 subjects had 
ITP. The incidence of AEs in the haemorrhage SMQ in the All 400 mg Analysis Set in subjects on 
concurrent anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications 16.8% compared with 11.5% in subjects not 
on concurrent anticoagulants. The reported cases of haemorrhage do not seem to indicate an 
increased bleeding risk associated with venetoclax therapy in CLL. 
There were few events of severe or serious adverse events with hepatobiliary disorders. One fatal case 
was in an 85 y old subject with preexisting elevations of LFT and prostate cancer, and 3 cases with 
elevations of ALT or AST >10 x ULN had concomitant multiorgan failure or TLS. A medical review did 
not identify any subject meeting Hy's law in the All 400 mg Analysis Set.  
Lymphopenia (or lymphocyte count decreased) occurred in 4.6% (11/240) of subjects in the All 400 
mg Analysis Set, and the events were grade ≥3 for the majority of subjects (7/11).  
In non-clinical studies, the key findings observed following venetoclax administration were decreased 
lymphocyte count, decreased red blood cell mass (at higher doses), testicular germ cell depletion in 
dogs, and embryo-fetal toxicity in mice, which were consistent with venetoclax's Bcl-2 inhibition. 
Discolouration (white) of fur was seen in some animals. 
Although only a few events of white hair discolouration have been reported in clinical trial subjects, the 
data are confounded by large as the majority of subjects in clinical trials being elderly.  
A general safety update (10 February 2016 data cut) has been provided for all subjects receiving 400 
mg venetoclax (All 400 mg Analysis Set, N = 296). The median follow-up for venetoclax increased by 1 
month to 11.4 months (previously 10.3 months), with approximately 100 subjects who have received 
venetoclax for over 1 year.  Longer exposure (up to 2 years) is available for at least 28 subjects. 
Excluding disease progression, about 10% of patients discontinued venetoclax after median about 1 
year of therapy indicating good tolerability in pre-treated CLL patients. A safety update with a 10 
February 2016 data cut off has been provided for all subjects receiving 400 mg venetoclax (All 400 mg 
Analysis Set, N = 296). The median follow-up for venetoclax increased by 1 month to 11.4 months 
(previously 10.3 months), with approximately 100 subjects who have received venetoclax for over 1 
year.  Longer exposure (up to 2 years) is available for at least 28 subjects. Excluding disease 
progression, about 10% of patients discontinued venetoclax after median about 1 year of therapy 
indicating good tolerability in pre-treated CLL patients. 
Confirmation of overall safety with a specific focus on Richter’s transformation will be derived from 
Study GO28667 (MURANO), this is a multicenter, phase III, open-label, randomised study in 
elapsed/refractory CLL patients to evaluate the benefit of venetoclax in combination with rituximab 
compared with bendamustine plus rituximab.  
The safety and efficacy of immunisation with live attenuated vaccines during or following venetoclax 
therapy have not been studied. Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment and 
thereafter until B-cell recovery. 
As discussed under clinical pharmacology co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased 
venetoclax exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. Concomitant use of venetoclax with 
strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The main safety finding in the venetoclax monotherapy studies in CLL was the risk of TLS, especially at 
the initiation of treatment and most pronounced in subjects with a high tumour burden. A slow ramp-
up dosing during the first 5 weeks combined with close patient monitoring seems largely to have 
overcome this risk, but there may still be a concern in select patients. Other safety events were those 
encountered in advanced CLL eg infections, cytopenias and transformation. Incidences were mostly 
within the expected range for the study population and no clear causal link between transformation 
events and venetoclax therapy has been established, also due to the lack of comparative data.  
Discontinuations for TEAEs unrelated to disease progression were <10%, which seems acceptable in 
this group of patients.  
In conclusion, albeit further analyses are still requested, the safety profile of venetoclax in subjects 
with del17p-CLL, and in those with R/R CLL, seems to be clinically manageable. 
Generally, the evaluation of the safety profile of venetoclax is hampered by the fact the underlying 
disease may be the major contributor to, e.g. infectious events, ITP and squamous carcinoma of the 
skin. High age is an obvious risk factor for vascular events. Therefore safety data from a comparative, 
randomised study would be necessary.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
 
PASS Study GO28667 (MURANO) in relapsed/refractory patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia to evaluate the safety of venetoclax plus rituximab compared with bendamustine 
plus rituximab. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
 
The applicant should provide further data on safety for study M14-032 of venetoclax in chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia patients relapsed after or refractory to treatment with B-cell receptor 
signaling pathway inhibitor therapy.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Venclyxto (venetoclax) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Beneficial effects 
Updated results from Study M13-982 - an ongoing single-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of venetoclax monotherapy 400 mg daily in subjects with R/R CLL with 17p del that includes the TP53 
locus- showed an ORR of 82.4 % in the safety expansion (SE) cohort 74.8 % in the main cohort; 
77.2% in both cohorts with CR of 15.7; 19.6% 18.4% respectively. Radiologic response was observed 
at the first visit for most subjects in the main cohort, whilst CR evolved after prolonged treatment, up 
to several months. 
Durability of response was long, resulting in PFS at 24 months 69% (95% CI 60; 77%) in the main 
cohort and PFS at 12 months in the SE cohort being 80% (95% CI 66; 89%). In the main cohort, 
documented minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in peripheral blood and on therapy was about 
26%, i.e. higher than the complete remission rates. No obvious subgroup-related differences were 
reported.    
In open-label, multi-centre study Study M14-032 evaluating 400 mg of venetoclax in subjects with CLL 
who were refractory or intolerant to treatment with either ibrutinib or idelalisib, updated ORR results 
(10 June 2016) were at 69.8 % (IRC) and 67.4% (Inv) in ibrutinib failed cohort and 61.9% / 57.1% in 
the idelalisib failed cohort. CR at 2.3 % (IRC); 7% (Inv) was seen at the ibrutinib-failed group whereas 
in the idelalisib – failed group the IRC has seen no CR, the investigators have assessed as 14.3% of

patients achieved CR. The updated analyses ORR results of 10 June 2016, appear similar after 
idelalisib and ibrutinib failure.  
Subjects who had relapse while on therapy or had lack of response within 6 months of treatment with 
a BCRi were determined as having refractory disease. The majority of subjects in both arms were 
previously refractory to BCRi therapy, although proportionally more subjects who entered Arm B 
discontinued idelalisib due to intolerance. In refractory disease the ORR was about 67% after ibrutinib 
failure and about 71% after idelalisib failure. Status with respect to del17p/TP53 apparently did not 
affect response rates. Altogether 40 patients had failed both chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and BCRi and 
in this group the ORR was 25/40 (95% CI 46; 77%).  
Updated data from the supportive, dose escalation and safety expansion Phase 1 study M12-175 show 
an ORR of 82% in the broader relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL population. Current estimate for PFS at 
24 months is 62% (10 June, 2016).  
Median durations of exposure in the studies M13-982 and M12-175 are considered sufficiently long for 
a reasonably precise estimate of benefit.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
As approvals of ibrutinib and idelalisib were relatively recent, the data on patient outcome after failure 
on a BCRi is rather limited. Although the anti-tumour activity of venetoclax in BCRi refractory patients 
independent of 17p deletion/TP53 mutation was acknowledged, the non-comparative and  limited data 
due to low number of subjects and limited follow-up time in this population represents an uncertainty. 
Moreover, the patient population in this study is more heterogeneous, e.g. in terms of the number of 
prior therapies, but it is agreed that prior failure on idelalisib, ibrutinib or CIT has no major influence 
on reported response rates and that del17p/TP53 status seems not to be of importance. The latter has 
also replicated in M12-175 and ex vivo.  Very few patients have been treated >2y and PFS and OS 
data are still immature. 
Therefore, additional efficacy data would be needed as confirmatory and will be provided from the 
expanded study M14-032 (first cohort PFS at 48 weeks and second cohort ORR and PFS at 36 weeks) 
are expected in the context of a conditional MA in order to expand the  (See Annex II and RMP). Study 
M14-032 was recently amended to include a second cohort comprising an additional 60 BCRi failure 
patients to further assess the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in patients with prior BCRi failure and 
this will also provide additional efficacy and safety data in post-BCRi 17p/TP53 mutation negative CLL 
patients. Currently 55 patients are enrolled (23 subjects with del 17p/TP53mut; 30 patients without 
del 17p/TP53mut). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
A general safety update was submitted for all subjects receiving 400 mg venetoclax (All 400 mg 
Analysis Set, N = 296).  In addition, updated safety data for 17p del subjects receiving 400 mg 
venetoclax (N = 188) and subjects with previous BCRi failures receiving 400 mg venetoclax (N = 94). 
The main safety concern in the venetoclax monotherapy studies in CLL was the risk of tumour lysis 
syndrome (TLS), especially at the initiation of treatment and most pronounced in subjects with a high 
tumour burden. Following protocol amendments that included a slow ramp-up dosing during the first 5 
weeks, close monitoring and other measures, the risk for clinical TLS seems largely contained at an 
reported incidence of about 3%. 
Assessment report

Dose reductions were undertaken in a total of about 10% mainly for neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia, but also, e.g. for diarrhoea. Dose interruptions were more common; close to one in 
three subjects reported interruption for adverse events. The cumulative discontinuation rate after 
about 600 days was about 13%, which is considered low.  
As expected in the treatment of CLL, infectious events were very common and altogether there were 
about 20% of infectious events classified as SAEs, mainly pneumonia.   
Adverse events with a reasonable possibility of being related to venetoclax that occurred in ≥ 10% of 
subjects in the All 400 mg Analysis Set were neutropenia (≈30%), nausea (≈20%), diarrhoea (≈20%), 
fatigue (≈10%), thrombocytopenia (≈10%), and anaemia (≈10%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Assessment of the safety profile of venetoclax is compromised by the lack of controlled data as 
manifestations of CLL include cytopenias, infectious events, immune deficiencies, second primary 
malignancies, etc.  
Tumour progression is inherent in CLL, including transformation/Richter's syndrome. The incidence 
[~10%] of Richter’s syndrome appears somewhat high compared with historical data, but the studies 
enrolled patients at high risk and specific measures were undertaken to identify cases of 
transformation. Even though no potential underlying mechanistic explanation has been identified, 
Richter’s transformation should be considered an important potential risk. Ongoing and projected 
studies in less advanced CLL may shed further light onto this issue.  
The data on long term safety effects put in relation to the durability of response are limited, as is the 
clinical experience on the development of resistance for venetoclax.  
There was an apparent about 50% reduction in numbers of circulating T-cells. This may at least partly 
be explained by “contamination” of the FACS analyses by apparently CD3/CD19 co-expressing cells, 
i.e. cells with B and T-cell markers. Re-analyses are ongoing and will be provided as recommended by 
the CHMP. 
Safety data from the MURANO study are expected to confirm the safety profile of venetoclax in 
comparison with bendamustin, the data should be discussed in the light of studies M12-075, M13-982, 
and M14-032.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In early stage CLL, approximately 5% to 10% of patients have a 17p del and/or TP53 mutation; this 
rate increases with treatment lines up to 40% in advanced refractory CLL and is associated with low 
activity/resistance to chemo- and chemo-immuno therapy. 
No randomised comparative studies have been submitted in support of this MAA, but durable objective 
responses lead to improvement in the symptomatology, including haematological parameters and is 
considered an informative outcome measure in patients with CLL evaluable also in single arm studies.  
At the start of the clinical development of CLL for venetoclax, there were no satisfactory therapeutic 
options for CLL with 17p del/TP53-mutations, apart from allogeneic SCT suitable for very few, younger 
patients in good general health after achieving a good response to toxic regimen. Available chemo-
immuno therapies (ICT), are associated with short lived partial responses and were the only alternative 
for the great majority of patients. In fact, and probably as a result of the poor response seen 
retrospectively in 17p del CLL to known treatments, no dedicated prospective studies were undertaken 
in this subgroup.  
In the last few years, novel therapies have emerged showing durable responses in a significant 
proportion in this high-risk subgroup of CLL leading to the licensure of idelalisib and ibrutinib. Study 
M14-032 was undertaken in an heterogeneous late-line population of patients failing BCRi:s (n=63), 
resistance and intolerant, del 17p positive and negative) and ICT (n=40) .  As these BCRis (idelalisib 
and ibrutinib) have only recently entered clinical practice, data on BCRi failed/discontinuing patients 
are limited.  
In patients failing BCRis without the 17pdel/TP53mut there are might be more therapeutic options 
available, such as CIT. These patients can also be treated with the alternate kinase inhibitor, and 
based on retrospective data this latter has recently been reported to provide response rates of 6/12 to 
idelalisib-based therapy after ibrutinib failure and 10/13 to ibrutinib-based therapy after idelalisib 
failure (Mato, ASH 2015), but patient numbers are low and follow up is brief.  
As for the unfavourable effects, TLS was identified early on as an important and serious risk with 
venetoclax, especially at the initiation of therapy. This risk now seems largely to have been contained 
through preventive measures including ramp-up dosing and involving risk-staging and close 
monitoring. 
The risk of infections is inherent in advanced CLL and is to be a remaining concern during venetoclax 
therapy. The pattern of infections reported in the present studies, however, seems to agree with that 
observed in many previous studies in R/R CLL and the rate of opportunistic infections is inconspicuous.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
On the basis of the totality of the data including those in BCRi experienced patients the applied 
indication was revised to “Venclyxto is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutations, or who are unsuitable 
for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.”  
As there are differences in the safety profiles comparing venetoclax with idelalisib and ibrutinib, and 
possible anticipated differences in tolerance, the defined use of venetoclax in this population is 
clinically meaningful.  
Assessment report  
EMA/725631/2016 
Page 129/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The presence of deletion 17p and TP53 mutations do not affect the activity of venetoclax. In addition 
prior therapy with available BCRIs and CIT appears not to affect the activity of venetoclax to a major 
degree. It is acknowledged that data are sparse (n=40), but based on submitted data showing PFS at 
12 months being about 80% (95% CI 60; 90%), benefit – risk is considered favourable, especially 
when put in the context of the totality of data. Altogether the following indication is supported: 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway 
inhibitor. 
Additional 60 patients will be enrolled in M14-032. This will enable confirmation of benefit – risk in the 
target population for the second part of the indication (specific obligation).      
Safety data are non-comprehensive, especially as comparative safety data are missing. From this 
perspective the ongoing MURANO study where venetoclax is compared with bendamustine is 
considered key information to the benefit – risk (category 1). 
The CHMP considered that Venclyxto falls under the scope of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 507/2006 as eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as it belongs to: 
a) Medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products in accordance with Article 3 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000; 
b) Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously 
debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases. 
Furthermore, the requirements listed in Article 4 of Commission Regulation No 507/2006 apply to 
venetoclax on the basis of the following reasons: 
a) The risk-benefit balance of the product is positive:  
In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutations (Study 
M13-982) the overall response rate was 82.4 % in the safety expansion (SE) cohort, 74.8 % in the 
main cohort, and 77.2% in both cohorts; with CR of 15.7; 19.6% 18.4% respectively. Durability of 
response was long, resulting in PFS at 24 months of 69% (95% CI 60%; 77%) in the main cohort and 
PFS at 12 months in the SE cohort of 80% (95% CI 66%; 89%). 
In subjects with CLL who were refractory or intolerant to treatment with either ibrutinib or idelalisib 
(study M14-032) responses were 69.8 % (IRC) and 67.4% (Inv) in ibrutinib failed cohort and 61.9% / 
57.1% in the idelalisib failed cohort.  Together with an acceptable safety-profile in patients in the 
proposed indications, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
b) It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data: 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of 
venetoclax in the proposed indications. The updated M14-032 CSR will be submitted in 2018 (n=124) 
providing longer term efficacy and safety follow up for original cohort (n=64) and a second, 60 patient 
cohort has been added to the M14-032 protocol; of which 55 patients are currently enrolled. A 
complete 36 week response assessment for the second cohort is foreseen. 
c) Fulfilment of unmet medical needs in the proposed indications: 
There is no satisfactory treatment in post-BCRi CLL and there is no evidence-based standard of care in 
post-BCRi CLL, irrespective of mutation status. Further chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) in this population 
would be expected to have limited efficacy (Median PFS of 7 months to non-kinase inhibitor (Mato, 
2015); Median PFS of 11 to 15 months for Bendamustine/Rituximab (BR); e.g. HELIOS).

d) The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required: 
In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile, the high response rate including MRD responses, and 
acceptable safety profile, the immediate availability of Venclyxto on the market outweighs the risk 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus, is of the opinion that Venclyxto is not similar to Arzerra, Gazyvaro or 
Imbruvica within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 
1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Venclyxto in the following indications: 
• 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or 
have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.  
• 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell 
receptor pathway inhibitor. 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures 
 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
PASS: In order to further confirm the overall safety profile and investigate the risk of 
Richter’s syndrome/secondary primary malignancies, the MAH should submit the 
results of the MURANO study comparing venetoclax plus rituximab to bendamustine 
plus rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL  
Due date 
March 2018 
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of venetoclax, the MAH should 
submit the clinical study report of study M14-032 investigating venetoclax in patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia relapsed after or refractory to treatment with B-
cell receptor signalling pathway inhibitors.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Within the remit of the current type II variation, the MAH is seeking extension of indication for 
Keytruda in the adjuvant setting of stage IIB and IIC melanoma for both adolescents aged 12 years 
and older and adults, and is pursuing a paediatric indication encompassing adolescents aged 12 years 
and older for the already licensed use of Keytruda as adjuvant therapy in stage III melanoma and as 
treatment of advanced melanoma.   
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The current application pertains to the treatment of melanoma in both adults (stage IIB and IIC) and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older (stage IIB, IIC, III and advanced stage): 
- KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 
12 years and older with Stage IIB, Stage IIC or with Stage III melanoma and lymph node 
involvement who have undergone complete resection. 
- KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.

Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The worldwide incidence of melanoma has increased rapidly over last decades among white 
populations, especially in people older than 60 years of age. In Europe, the incidence rate is < 10-25 
new cases over 100,000 habitants. In the paediatric population melanoma occurs with rare frequency 
especially in youngest children but the incidence of disease increases by age with an estimated rate of 
10.4 per million in the 15-19 year olds. While cases are expected to substantially augment in the older 
population, the most recent epidemiology data indicate a stabilisation of melanoma incidence in the 
youngest, possibly due to the favourable influence of public campaigns to promote healthy sun 
exposure behaviours.  Indeed, the main exogenous risk factor for melanoma is UV exposure, while 
inherited conditions including melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variants or phenotypes characterised by 
high numbers of common naevi or presence of congenital naevi are recognised predisposing factors. 
Similar considerations apply to the majority of paediatric melanoma that are sporadic and mostly 
related to UV-mediated DNA damage.  
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Melanoma is a malignant tumour that arises from melanocytes and primarily involves the skin. It is 
classified as melanoma in situ when confined within the epidermis, or invasive when atypical 
melanocytes progressively invade into the dermis.  
The 4th edition, 2018 of the WHO classification of skin tumours distinguishes melanoma subtypes based 
on  the  pathway  concept  of  melanoma  pathogenesis  and  its  association  with  sun-exposed  skin  that 
consequently determines the genetic hallmark of lesions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 8/128 
 
 
 
Four histology-based melanoma subtypes are also described, including superficial spreading melanoma 
(SSM, 41%), nodular melanoma (NM, 16%), lentigo malignant melanoma (LMM, 2.7-14%) and acral 
lentiginous melanoma (ALM, 1-5%). Of note, distinction of different subtypes, either based on UV-
exposure relationship or pure histology features does not provide prognostic indications and is not 
considered in the current tumour staging system. Indeed, the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging 
Manual offers a clinical and pathological classification of lesions based on thickness, ulceration, and 
level of metastization as these features have been identified as major prognostic factors. 
Paediatric melanoma is conventionally distinguished into three main categories, including conventional 
melanoma (CM), melanoma arising in congenital nevi (CNM), and spitzoid melanoma.  
CMs show a high rate of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) that are characteristic of UV damage and 
displays a high rate of genetic similarities with adult melanoma. On the contrarily, there is evidence 
that melanoma arising in CNMs shows a lower frequency of UV-related mutations, possibly due to a 
higher baseline risk. Spitzoid melanoma refers to malignant nature of spitz tumours, as defined by 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 9/128 
 
 
 
 
 
large epithelioid melanocytes resembling those found in Spitz nevi. They may be challenging to classify 
since the histopathologic features that are commonly taken as indicators of malignancy, such as 
nuclear atypia, scatter of melanocytes in the upper epidermis, poor maturation within the dermis, deep 
extension, and deep dermal mitoses, are not uncommonly seen in Spitz tumours with benign biologic 
behavior [4]. The 2018 WHO classification of skin tumours introduced the concept of Spitz melanoma 
(malignant Spitz tumour) as a melanoma subtype that not only has the morphologic features of Spitz 
tumours, but also has their genetic hallmarks. The 8th Edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual also applies 
to paediatric melanoma. 
The comparison between adult and paediatric melanoma is challenging given the poorly investigated 
biology and pathogenesis of disease in the paediatric setting. Controversial findings have been 
reported in terms of prognostic values in the young age categories for histopathological hallmarks such 
as ulceration and thickness (see below section), differences in primary site of lesions between adults 
and adolescents have been described, as well as stage at diagnosis and tumour subtypes. Overall, a 
distinct biological behaviour of melanoma in adults and young has been described that need to be 
accounted for. Nevertheless, it should be considered that clinical features associated to the youngest 
age including the different reactivity of the immune system and consequent cancer surveillance are 
considered to favourably impact on clinical prognosis and survival. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis <and stage/prognosis 
About 90% of melanomas are diagnosed as primary tumours without metastasis, with a 10-year-survival 
rate of 75-95%. Site of lesions in adults more often involves the head and neck. 
Stratification of patients into classes of risks as based on the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging 
guides melanoma clinical management. Stage IIB and IIC, which the current application refers to for 
the adult indication, identifies high-risk primary tumours (N0, M0) with lesions >2-4 mm of thickness 
and ulcerated (T3b), or > 4 mm thickness either with or without ulceration (T4a and T4b). Stage IIC is 
considered more aggressive than IIB and displays a prognosis similar to Stage IIIB. Their prognosis is 
illustrated in the figures below:  
Similar to adults, primary lesions are the most frequent clinical presentation of melanoma in 
adolescent patients aged 12 years and older; however, sites of lesions are different since they more 
often involve the trunk, especially in males, and extremity in females.  
The prognostic role of age, gender, tumour thickness, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node status is less 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 10/128 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
characterised  than  in  adult  disease.  Specifically,  the  association  between  thickness  and  survival  is 
controversial. Tumour thickness and ulceration are strong predictors of sentinel lymph node metastases 
among children. Similar to adults, a positive sentinel lymph node is associated with poorer prognosis. A 
diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma confers a better prognosis than conventional melanoma due to a lower 
frequency of recurrence and metastatization with lethal outcomes than adult-like lesions.  
In addition to the melanoma-specific differences in terms of cancer behaviour, it should be considered 
that the immune system reactivity diminishes with age, thus accounting for an immune system 
surveillance that is reduced in older populations compared to youngest individuals. The immunological 
response represents a biological factor that is believed to contribute to a better prognosis of melanoma 
in paediatric ages. This is an important aspect to consider in the context of a treatment that aims at 
boosting immune-mediated responses against tumour progression.   
Management 
Systemic therapies licensed for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma are summarised in the following 
table: 
With particular reference to the treatment of primary melanoma Stage IIB and IIC, surgical resection 
with a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) represents the first-line approach. In the event of a negative 
SNB, follow-up with active surveillance for recurrence is the solely recommended action to be 
undertaken accordingly with the most recent guidelines. It is estimated that 90% of relapse occurs 
during the first 5 years post-surgery, which is therefore considered the most critical period for 
monitoring.  Adjuvant systemic therapy is contemplated at relapse. 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 11/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment in adolescents relies upon surgical strategies. Adjuvant systemic therapies are currently not 
licensed in Europe. For the treatment of the advanced (unresectable or metastatic) stage, the only 
approved drug concerns ipilimumab as monotherapy. It is however noted that this treatment in the 
respective adult disease has been replaced by the available PD-1 inhibitors owning a better efficacy 
and safety profile.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype with a PD-1 blocking activity. The 
resulting prevention of interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2, leads to a stimulation of the 
immune-mediated anti-tumour activity mediated by T cell lymphocytes. Pembrolizumab also modulates 
the level of IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines. The antibody potentiates existing immune 
responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not non-specifically activate T cells. 
Pembrolizumab is currently approved in EU as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for 
the treatment of different cancer types (i.e. melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, urothelial cancer, cHL 
and MSI-H mCRC). With particular reference to the management of melanoma, the granted license 
reads as follows: 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma in adults.  
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage III melanoma 
and lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection (see SmPC section 5.1). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice (SA) was received pertaining to the clinical development of Keytruda as adjuvant 
treatment in Stage II melanoma, including the paediatric indication. 
The CHMP recommended an application based on IA2 of Study Keynote-716 to allow for sufficient data 
maturity. RFS was noted to be an acceptable endpoint in the adjuvant setting. However, in order to 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 12/128 
 
 
 
 
support sound conclusions on efficacy and to address the strategic aspect of early therapy (adjuvant) 
versus late treatment (at recurrence), inclusion of PRFS2 data was also advised. 
Regarding the paediatric indication, the CHMP emphasised the concern on long-term safety sequaelae 
related to pembrolizumab toxicity profile, and the limited data on efficacy available in adolescents with 
advanced melanoma at the time of SA application. In the current submission, the numerosity of the 
paediatric sample size remains limited to 2 patients in the pivotal KEYNOTE-716 (one patient in each 
treatment arm) and 8 subjects enrolled in study KEYNOTE-051, which is described in the agreed PIP 
for which a positive compliant report has been issued (PIP decision number: P/0043/2018). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH stated that all studies were conducted according to current standard research approaches 
and following appropriate GCP standards and considerations for the ethical treatment of human 
participants that were in place at the time the studies were performed 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Keytruda is a protein and is therefore exempt from the ERA requirements. This is compliant to the 
current Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
KEYNOTE-716 is an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of pembrolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of adult and paediatric (12 years and older) 
patients with completely resected Stage IIB and IIC melanoma, and a negative SLN biopsy. 
A total of 976 participants, 12 years and older (including 2 paediatric participants, one in the placebo 
arm), were randomized to pembrolizumab or placebo q3w in a 1:1 ratio. 
This application is supported by the results of KEYNOTE-054 to provide context for understanding the 
efficacy and safety of adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy and by extrapolation from adult to paediatric 
(>12 years of age) melanoma based on similar biology and treatment paradigm to adult melanoma as 
well as PK and safety data from KEYNOTE-051 for paediatric participants with advanced melanoma.  
KEYNOTE-051 is a nonrandomized, open-label, single-arm, combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Part I and 
Part II) study to evaluate the PK, PD, toxicity, safety, and antitumour activity of pembrolizumab in 
paediatric participants aged 6 months to less than 18 years with advanced melanoma or a PD-L1 
positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumour or lymphoma. 
Part I (dose finding and dose confirmation) has been completed. Part I also evaluated the safety, PK, 
PD, toxicity, and preliminary efficacy of pembrolizumab. Part II (tumour cohort expansion at the RP2D) 
is ongoing and further evaluates the safety and efficacy at the established RP2D. The study has been 
conducted at 51 centres in 12 countries for approximately 6 years. 
In  KEYNOTE-716  participants  with  resected,  Stage  IIB  and  IIC  melanoma  received  adjuvant 
pembrolizumab 200 mg q3w (adult dose) or 2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg q3w (paediatric dose).  
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 16/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pembrolizumab PK in adults has been characterised within the previous applications, therefore in the 
present variation only the extrapolation to paediatric patients (>12 years old) has been discussed. 
Paediatric populations 
As novel therapies for adults with melanoma have led to dramatically improved outcomes, treatment 
options for paediatric patients with high-risk and advanced melanoma are still limited. Due to the rarity 
of melanoma in younger age groups, recruitment into clinical trials is often hampered and relevant 
data are scarce. KEYNOTE-716 was open to recruitment of patients aged 12 years and older and 2 
adolescent participants were enrolled. 
This  application  is  supported  by  the  extrapolation  from  adult  to  adolescent  melanoma  based  on  the 
following: 
(a) similarity of melanoma disease biology between adults and paediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years, 
and (b) similar pharmacology of drug effect and similar exposure-response for efficacy and safety.  
The paediatric dose of pembrolizumab is well-established and is approved in the EU for treatment of 
paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory cHL. 
Based on available PK data in KEYNOTE-051, the paediatric clinical study of pembrolizumab, and 
extrapolation of adult PK data, it was determined that 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) q3w 
dosing provides appropriate exposure in paediatric patients. KEYNOTE-051 has resulted in the first 
approval for KEYTRUDA in the EU for paediatric patients with cHL. Apart from a cohort of 22 patients 
aged 11 years to 17 years with cHL, this approval was also based on extrapolation of pharmacology 
and PK data. 
a) Similarity of Melanoma Disease Biology Between Adults and Paediatric Patients Aged 12 to 17 Years 
The continuity of melanoma disease across patients ~12 to 17 years of age and >18 years of age 
confirms that it is essentially the same disease in adolescents and adults. This is underscored by 
shared predisposing factors such as exposure to UV sunlight, red hair, blue eyes, poor tanning ability, 
freckling, dysplastic nevi, and a family history. Many genetic abnormalities are shared between adult 
and paediatric melanoma, and germline variants in several genes (eg, MC1R, CDKN2A) have been 
associated with the development of familial melanoma in children and adults. Melanoma in adolescents 
has many genomic similarities to adult melanoma, including an enrichment of UV-induced mutations, a 
high prevalence of TERT-promoter mutations, and involvement of similar oncogenes (such as BRAF) 
and tumour suppressor genes. The clinical presentation of melanoma in adolescence is similar to that 
of adults; most tumours arise in previously healthy skin. The most common subtype of melanoma in 
both adolescents and adults is superficial spreading melanoma. 
Treatment of melanoma in childhood and adults generally uses a similar strategy. Surgery is the 
mainstay of treatment for localized disease. For adult patients with clinically node negative disease and 
a primary tumour with Breslow depth ≥1 mm, examination of regional lymph nodes using SLN biopsy 
is the standard of care and has become routine as well in many paediatric centres. Surgical resection 
of cutaneous melanoma in paediatric patients includes full-thickness biopsy for diagnosis, WLE with 
margins based on lesion depth, and selective use of SLN biopsy and CLND. The use of CLND in 
paediatric patients should weigh the risk of morbidity against the risk of recurrence over their longer 
life span compared with adults, as well as taking into account evolving standards of care for SLN 
biopsy and CLND. 
KEYNOTE-716 is the first Phase 3 study to report results for the adjuvant treatment of Stage IIB and 
IIC melanoma in participants aged 12 years and older. Given the rarity of the disease, only 2 
adolescent participants were enrolled in approximately 2 years, although many sites were open to 
enrollment in this age group.  
Assessment report

b) Similar Pharmacology of Drug Effect and Similar Exposure-Response for Efficacy and Safety 
As part of procedure EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090 for pembrolizumab for cHL, which obtained approval for 
an extension of the indication in adults to an earlier line of therapy and resulted in an approval for 
paediatric patients aged 3 years and older on 09-MAR-2021, it was shown that a similar exposure-
response relation for pembrolizumab exists across indications. It is expected that these data obtained 
in cHL are also relevant for melanoma. 
Data presented in the cHL submission showed that the exposure-response relationship and PK profile 
are similar in adult and paediatric patients (6 years of age and older). No information can be provided 
on the exposure-response relationship between adult and paediatric patients in melanoma. However, 
since consistent flat exposure-response relationships are seen for pembrolizumab in multiple tumour 
types and since clearance is not meaningfully different across tumour types, this suggests that 
saturation of the target in circulation is achieved at the clinical dose across all tumour types. This 
further supports that PK/exposures and exposure-response relationships are consistent across 
indications. 
During KEYNOTE-716 only 2 female adolescents of 16 and 17 years of age were enrolled, of these just 
one adolescent received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV q3w. Considering that, no conclusion can be 
drawn on PK and immunogenicity in adolescents with data from KEYNOTE-716.  
An extrapolation from adult to adolescent melanoma was made based on the following: 
(1) similarity of melanoma disease biology between adults and paediatric patients aged 12 to17 years, 
and  
(2) similar pharmacology of drug effect and similar exposure-response for efficacy and safety. The 
paediatric dose of pembrolizumab is well-established and is approved in the EU for treatment of 
paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory cHL. 
The similarity of the disease between adolescent and adults is evaluated and commented in the efficacy 
section, please refer to the relative one. 
Regarding the pharmacology similarity, the MAH states that the PK profile and exposure-response 
relationship in paediatric patients with advanced cancers are similar to those in adults, supporting 
these conclusions with the data from KEYNOTE-051 (EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090). During that procedure, 
figures at Cycle 1 and steady state are generated for KEYNOTE-051 paediatric participants and 
KEYNOTE-204 adult cHL participants, based on the updated popPK model including adult cHL 
participants and paediatric participants with solid tumours and cHL. 
The PK model parameter estimates (CL and Vc) are lower for paediatric patients compared to adults. 
This was expected, since the parameters have been shown to be correlated to body weight. Exposure 
parameters following the weight-based regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W are largely similar between the 
paediatric age groups and between paediatrics and adults.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
A description of the immunogenicity of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant melanoma setting was included 
in the KEYNOTE-054 application to support approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant 
setting for Stage III melanoma participants [variation II/47]. The immunogenicity evaluation 
confirmed that pembrolizumab has a limited potential to elicit the information of ADA in the adjuvant 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 18/128 
 
 
 
 
monotherapy setting, which is consistent with the results of prior immunogenicity evaluations of 
pembrolizumab in the non-adjuvant monotherapy setting 
No updated analysis was performed on immunogenicity in paediatrics within the variation II/90 
(KEYNOTE-051); details of the immunogenicity analysis are available in the prior version of the CSR of 
study KN051 in which out of the 133 paediatric subjects included in the immunogenicity assessment, 
125 subjects were evaluable. The evaluable subject group contains 2 subjects with non-treatment 
emergent positive status (1.6%), and 123 with negative immunogenicity status (98.4%). There were 
no subjects with a treatment emergent positive status observed. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new PK/PD modelling was included in this application. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
An extrapolation from adult to adolescent melanoma (>12 years of age) was made by the MAH 
assuming the similarity of melanoma disease biology between adults and paediatric patients aged 12 
to 17 years, and similar pharmacology of drug effect and similar exposure-response for efficacy and 
safety. 
The proposed paediatric dose of pembrolizumab is the one already approved in the EU for treatment of 
paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory cHL (2 mg/kg Q3W). 
Regarding the pharmacology similarity, the MAH states that the PK profile and exposure-response 
relationship in paediatric patients with advanced cancers are similar to those in adults, supporting 
these conclusions with the data from KEYNOTE-051 (EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090). Exposure parameters 
following the weight-based regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W are largely similar between the paediatric age 
groups and between paediatrics and adults.  
As of the data cutoff date for the II/90 variation submitted report (10-JAN-2020), 162 participants 
(N=22 rrcHL patients) were enrolled out of a total of up to 310 participants that were planned to be 
enrolled, in total, there were 151 participants in KEYNOTE-051 with evaluable PK samples. Since the 
last DCO (10-JAN-2020), only 5 new subjects, most with r/r cHL, and no new subject with melanoma, 
were enrolled; therefore additional analyses were not considered meaningful and not expected to alter 
any conclusions on dosing recommendations. 
No additional analysis has been conducted, neither for PK or exposure-response relationship. 
A discussion on exposure/response in melanoma in order to better substantiate and complete the 
bridging strategy was requested, however the MAH stated that due to limited number of paediatric 
melanoma patients, no information have been provided on the exposure-response relationship 
between adult and paediatric patients in melanoma. 
Therefore the conclusion on similar pharmacology between adults and adolescents in melanoma relies 
only on data data from KEYNOTE-051 (EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090). In which, observed plasma 
concentrations were consistent with predicted plasma concentrations derived from the reference popPK 
model, further supporting a flat exposure-response relationships across multiple tumour types, 
suggesting that saturation of the target in circulation is achieved at the clinical dose across all tumour 
types. 
IL-2 biomarker data in paediatric participants are limited, observed IL-2 simulation ratio data were 
collected and analysed for KEYNOTE-051. During EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090 variation assessment the IL-2 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 19/128 
 
 
 
stimulation ratio curves in paediatric participants were found to be consistent with those in adults; 
even if only 8 melanoma patients were enrolled in the study and it is not possible to establish if the HL 
paediatric data are well captured by the model. 
As reported by the MAH, the EU Reflection Paper on extrapolation for paediatrics foresees similar 
exposure-response for efficacy and safety in the extrapolation approach, however, no specific 
conclusion can be drawn on similar exposure-response for efficacy and safety in adolescent melanoma.   
An indirect conclusion on E-R is drawn: data in cHL presented in the submission for KEYNOTE-051 
showed that the E-R relationship and PK profile are similar in adult and paediatric patients. Since in 
adults consistent flat exposure-response relationships are seen for pembrolizumab in multiple tumour 
types and PK is not meaningfully different among tumour types, the exposure of pembrolizumab is also 
expected to be similar across all indications in paediatrics (similar to adults). 
Overall, the conclusions on similar pharmacology of drug effect are based only on data from KEYNOTE-
051 (EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090) and no specific conclusion can be drawn on similar exposure-response in 
adolescent melanoma. PK data supporting the bridging can be considered only as supportive. 
No updated analysis was performed on immunogenicity in paediatrics within the variation II/90 
(KEYNOTE-051); considering the small number of new subjects enrolled, it is not considered as 
meaningful additional analysis. 
As reported in the EPAR of variation II/47 (Extension of Indication to include as monotherapy the 
adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage III melanoma and lymph node involvement who have 
undergone complete resection, based on study KEYNOTE-054) the incidence for treatment-emergent 
ADA in evaluable subjects with melanoma treated in the adjuvant setting was 3.4% (17 of 495; 473 
negative, 5 non-treatment-emergent positive and 17 treatment-emergent positive). None of the 17 
treatment emergent positive subjects, had antibodies with neutralizing capacity, yielding an incidence 
of emergent neutralizing positive subjects of 0% (0 out of 495). These findings are slightly higher than 
the overall incidence in the non-adjuvant setting (1.8%). However, there was no incidence of 
treatment-emergent neutralizing positive subjects in the adjuvant treatment setting (0 out of 17), 
which is consistent with the low incidence seen in the non-adjuvant setting (0.4%). 
As immunogenicity has not been characterized in the adjuvant setting, the MAH was recommended in 
2017 to assess the immunogenicity of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting in studies KN054 and 
KN091 (comprising more than 1000 subjects). Immunogenicity data for KEYNOTE 054 were submitted 
in 2018 with 495 evaluable subjects. The current projection for the availability of data from KEYNOTE-
091 based on IA2 is late 1Q2022 with the target completion for the comprehensive immunogenicity 
assessment in 2Q2022. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the conclusions on similar pharmacology of drug effect are based on data from KEYNOTE-051 
(EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090). An indirect conclusion on E-R can be drawn based on the demonstrated 
similarity in E-R relationship and PK profile between adult and paediatric patients in cHL, and the 
assumption that the flat exposure-response relationship seen in adults across multiple tumour types is 
preserved in paediatric patients across indications. PK data supporting the bridging can be considered 
only as supportive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 20/128 
 
 
 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The current application relies upon a single pivotal trial, study KEYNOTE-716. KEYNOTE-716 is a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, crossover/rechallenge, multicentre, Phase 3 study of 
adjuvant pembrolizumab in participants 12 years of age and older with resected Stage IIB or IIC 
cutaneous melanoma. Participants must have had newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed, and 
completely resected melanoma with negative margins, and could not have received prior systemic 
therapy for Stage II melanoma. 
The MAH also refers to the already submitted and reviewed study KEYNOTE-054 as supportive data for 
the efficacy of pembrolizumab after complete resection of high-risk Stage III melanoma. A claim for 
extrapolation of data from adult to paediatric melanoma is made, based on similar biology and 
treatment. The PK and safety profile of pembrolizumab as derived in study KEYNOTE-051 for paediatric 
participants with advanced melanoma is also presented in support of the claimed indication. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Pembrolizumab is approved at the 2 mg/kg or 200 mg q3w dosing regimen for multiple indications 
across the globe. Currently, the 200 mg q3w dose is being evaluated in multiple clinical studies. An 
additional dosing regimen of 400 mg q6w has been approved in the EU on 28-MAR-2019 for all 
monotherapy indications approved at the time. This approval was supported by a modelling and 
simulation-based approach, bridging PK and E-R data between the 200 mg q3w and 400 mg q6w 
dosing regimens for approved indications in the monotherapy setting. Pediatric participants in 
KEYNOTE-716 with resected stage IIB and IIC melanoma received adjuvant pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg 
q3w up to a maximum of 200 mg q3w (paediatric dose). The 200 mg q3w dose is recommended as the 
appropriate adult dose based on prior indications. The 400 mg q6w regimen is considered a suitable 
dosing option for pembrolizumab based on the expected similarity of PK exposures, target saturation, 
and efficacy and safety profile with those for the approved dosing regimens of 200 mg q3w or 2 mg/kg 
q3w. For the paediatric indication, KEYNOTE-051, the paediatric clinical study of pembrolizumab, 
together with extrapolation of adult PK data, it was determined that 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 
mg) q3w dosing provides appropriate exposure in paediatric patients. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
Adjuvant Therapy with Pembrolizumab versus Placebo in Resected High-
risk Stage II Melanoma: A Randomized, Double-blind Phase 3 Study 
(KEYNOTE 716) 
Methods 
KEYNOTE-716 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, crossover/rechallenge, multicentre, 
Phase 3 study of adjuvant pembrolizumab in participants 12 years of age and older with resected 
Stage IIB or IIC cutaneous melanoma. Stage IIB and IIC cutaneous melanoma are defined as T 
category T3b, T4a, or T4b, with no regional nodal metastases (N0) confirmed by a negative SLN biopsy 
and no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) per AJCC eighth edition guidelines. Stage IIB is T3b or, M0 
T4a, N0; Stage IIC is T4a, N0, M0. Participants must have had newly diagnosed, pathologically

confirmed, and completely resected melanoma with negative margins, and could not have received 
prior systemic therapy for Stage II melanoma. 
Participants  in  Part  1  were  stratified  into  3  strata  for  adults  based  on  T-stage  tumour  thickness  and 
ulceration and there was a separate stratum for paediatric participants (≥12 years of age and <18 years

Participants under 18 years of age who were randomized to receive pembrolizumab at the beginning of 
Part 1 remained on the paediatric dose of pembrolizumab throughout Part 1. 
Participants who begin Part 2 as an adult will receive the fixed adult dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg 
Q3W) regardless of their Part 1 dosing regimen. 
In In the current application, only data from Part 1 are presented.

Treatments 
The treatment phase of the study consists of 2 parts: 
• Part 1 (Adjuvant Treatment): Pembrolizumab or placebo administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 17 
cycles. 
• Part 2 (Crossover/Rechallenge after First Recurrence): Pembrolizumab administered Q3W for 17 
cycles after resection of recurrent disease if feasible (local recurrence, including local metastatic lymph 
nodes, or distant metastasis) or up to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab Q3W for unresectable disease 
recurrence (unresectable local [regional metastatic lymph nodes, in-transit, satellite, and/or 
microsatellite metastases] or unresectable distant recurrence). 
This report includes efficacy and safety results from Part 1 only.

Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Of  note,  new  cases  of  melanoma  were  not  counted  as  events  for  recurrence-free-survival.  Disease 
recurrence was confirmed by investigator radiographically and/or by exam/biopsy and, when clinically 
appropriate, pathologically confirmed by the site. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Time to Subsequent Therapy (TTST) 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022

Time to subsequent therapy is defined as time from randomization to the date of first subsequent 
therapy (eg, surgery, radiation therapy, antineoplastic therapy) or death (whatever the cause) 
whichever occurs first. 
Progression/recurrence-free Survival 2 (PRFS2) 
Progression/recurrence-free Survival 2 is defined as the time between the date of randomization and 
the earliest of the following: 
- date of 1st disease progression per RECIST1.1 beyond the initial unresectable disease recurrence 
(unresectable local-regional disease recurrence or unresectable distant metastatic disease recurrence); 
- date of 2nd recurrence in patients without evidence of disease after surgery of a resectable 1st 
recurrence (resectable local regional recurrences or resectable distant metastatic disease recurrence); 
- date of death. 
Sample size 
In this study, approximately 954 participants were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the 
pembrolizumab and placebo adjuvant treatment arms. RFS is the primary endpoint for the study, with 
DMFS and OS as the key secondary endpoints. 
For RFS endpoint, the final analysis is event-driven and will be conducted after approximately 179 
events have been observed, unless the study is terminated early. It may occur at ~ 48 months after 
the first participant is randomized (depending on enrolment rate and event accumulation rate). Based 
on a target number of 179 events at the final analysis and 1 interim analysis at approximately 71% of 
the target number of events, the study has ~92% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.6 at 2.5% 
(1-sided) significance level. 
The above sample size and power calculations are based on the following assumptions: RFS follows a 
“cure” model with a long-term RFS of 50%; the 60-month RFS estimated to be 68% for the control 
group; an annual drop-out rate of 4.7%; enrollment period of 16 months; a follow-up period of 32 
months after the last participant is randomized. 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization was centrally determined using an interactive response technology 
(IRT) system. There are 2 study treatment arms. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to 
pembrolizumab study treatment or saline placebo study treatment in Part 1. 
Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
1. Melanoma T Stage (Table 3) for adults only 
2. A separate stratum for paediatric (age 12-17) participants

Blinding (masking) 
In Part 1 of this study a double-blinding technique was used.  
Statistical methods 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was used for the analysis of efficacy data.  
The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the RFS curve in each treatment group. 
The treatment comparison in RFS was evaluated using a stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox 
proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference (ie, HR and its 95% CI) between the treatment arms. Kaplan-Meier estimates and 
the corresponding 95% CIs at specific follow-up time-points were provided for RFS. The stratification 
factors used for randomization were applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox 
model. 
In the event that there are small strata, for the purpose of analysis, strata were combined to ensure 
sufficient number of participants, responses and events in each stratum.  
Due to the small number of paediatric participants enrolled (2 participants), stratum 1 (paediatric 
participants) was combined with other strata according to the T-stage level.  
Since disease assessment was performed periodically, events such as disease recurrence and 
metastatic disease recurrence can occur any time in the time interval between the last assessment 
where the event was not documented and the assessment when the event is documented. For the 
primary analysis, the true date of the event was approximated by the date of the first assessment at 
which event is objectively documented. Participants who do not experience a first recurrence event 
were censored at the last disease assessment date. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the RFS endpoint, a sensitivity analysis with a different set of 
censoring rules was performed. For the sensitivity analysis, the true date of the event was 
approximated by the date of the first assessment at which event is objectively documented, after ≤1 
missed disease assessment and before new anti-cancer therapy is initiated, if any. Participants who 
experience a first recurrence immediately after ≥2 consecutive missed disease assessments or after 
new anti-cancer therapy is initiated were censored at the last disease assessment prior to the earlier 
date of the ≥2 consecutive missed disease assessment or date the new anti-cancer therapy is initiated. 
Participants who do not experience a first recurrence event were censored at the last disease

assessment before new anti-cancer therapy is initiated, if any. The censoring rules for primary and 
sensitivity analyses of RFS are summarized in Table 8. 
The proportional hazards assumption on RFS were examined using both graphical and analytical 
methods if warranted. The log[-log] of the survival function vs. time for RFS may be plotted for the 
comparison between the pembrolizumab and placebo arms. If the curves are not parallel, indicating 
that hazards are not proportional, supportive analyses may be conducted to account for the possible 
non-proportional hazards effect associated with immunotherapies using, for example, the Restricted 
Mean Survival Time method [Uno, H., et al 2014] or a parametric method [Odell, P. M., et al 1994]. 
One assumption for the stratified Cox proportional hazard model is that the treatment HR is constant 
across the strata. If strong departures from this assumption are observed (which can result in a 
notably biased and/or less powerful analysis), a sensitivity analysis may be performed based on a two-
step weighted Cox model approach, in which the treatment effect is first estimated for each stratum, 
and then the stratum specific estimates are combined for overall inference using sample size weights 
[Mehrotra, D. V., et al 2012].  
New primary melanomas were not counted as RFS events for the primary RFS analysis. A sensitivity 
analysis to include new primary melanomas as RFS events were performed to assess the robustness of 
the RFS endpoint.

Multiplicity 
The multiplicity strategy specified in this section will be applied to the primary hypothesis and 2 
secondary hypotheses. The primary hypothesis tests the superiority of pembrolizumab to placebo with 
respect to RFS. The 2 secondary hypotheses test the superiority of pembrolizumab to placebo with 
respect to DMFS and OS. The overall Type-I error among the 3 hypotheses is strongly controlled at 
2.5% (one-sided), with 2.5% initially allocated to the RFS hypothesis. The study was considered a 
success if RFS is demonstrated to be statistically significant at either an interim analysis or the final 
analysis under multiplicity control. 
The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz [Maurer, W. 2013] to control multiplicity for 
multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. According to this approach, when a particular null 
hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to other hypothesis 
tests. 
Figure 4 shows that the initial one-sided α allocation is assigned to the RFS hypothesis. Should the RFS 
comparison be statistically significant, the 2.5% alpha will be reallocated to the DMFS comparison. 
Should the DMFS comparison be statistically significant, the 2.5% alpha will be reallocated to the OS 
comparison. 
The trial initially allocates α = 2.5%, one-sided to test RFS. Table 12 shows the boundary properties 
for the interim analyses, which were derived using a Lan-DeMets O'Brien- Fleming approximation 
spending function. Note that the final row indicates the total power to reject the null hypothesis for

RFS. 
Subgroup Analyses 
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the estimate of the 
between-group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for the primary endpoints were estimated 
and plotted within each category of the following classification variables: 
• T-Stage (T3b versus T4a versus T4b) 
• Age (<65 years versus ≥65 years) 
• Sex (male versus female) 
• Race (white versus nonwhite) 
• ECOG performance status (0 versus 1) or equivalent KPS or LPS status 
• Region (US vs. Ex-US) 
The consistency of the treatment effect was assessed descriptively via summary statistics by category 
for the classification variables listed above. If the number of participants in a category of a subgroup 
variable is less than 10% of the ITT population, the subgroup analysis was not to be performed for this 
category of the subgroup variable, and this subgroup variable may not be displayed in the forest plot. 
The subgroup analyses were conducted using an unstratified Cox model.

Patient-reported Outcomes 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
Based on completion and compliance rates, Week 12 was selected as the time point for analysing 
changes from baseline for the EORTC QLQ-C30. At Week 12 the completion rates in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups were 84.6% and 90.5%, respectively; the compliance rates were 
84.8% and 90.5%, respectively. 
Adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment resulted in a difference in LS means of -2.18 [95% CI: -4.19, -
0.17] in global health status QoL at Week 12 compared with placebo. The change from baseline to 
Week 12 in physical functioning was similar in the treatment groups. 
The proportions of participants for whom the change from baseline in the global health status score 
and physical functioning score had improved, remained stable, or deteriorated were similar in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups (data not shown).

The mean changes from baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 QoL and physical functioning scores over time 
are presented below.  
EQ-5D-5L 
Based on completion and compliance rates, Week 36 was selected as the time point for analyzing 
change from baseline for the EQ-5D-5L. At Week 36 the completion rates in the pembrolizumab and 
placebo groups were 61.0% and 64.4%, respectively; the compliance rates were 78.4% and 82.8%, 
respectively. Analysis of the EQ-5D-5L score at Week 36 showed no difference between the treatment 
groups.

Sensitivity Analyses 
A sensitivity analysis that included new primary melanomas as part of the RFS analysis was performed 
to evaluate the robustness of the RFS endpoint. The results were consistent with the primary analysis, 
with an improvement in RFS in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group (HR=0.64 
[95% CI: 0.46, 0.88; nominal p=0.00274]).

A  second  sensitivity  analysis,  in  which  a  different  censoring  rule  was  applied,  was  also  performed  to 
evaluate the robustness of the RFS endpoint. The results were consistent with the primary analysis.

Notes 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The MAH submitted an efficacy analysis by age (<65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84) based on IA1 DCO. 
The analysis for age >85-year category was not provided due to a very limited size in this subgroup (2 
participants, both in the placebo group). The trend observed is generally comparable across different 
age sub-categories and consistent with the primary analysis in the ITT population.

Supportive study(ies) 
KEYNOTE-054 is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study investigating adjuvant therapy 
with pembrolizumab versus placebo after complete resection of high-risk Stage III melanoma. 
The results of KEYNOTE-054 showed that adjuvant pembrolizumab provided a significant and clinically 
meaningful benefit in RFS and DMFS compared with placebo and established PD-1 inhibition as an 
active adjuvant therapy for patients with resected, high-risk, Stage III melanoma regardless of PD-L1 
status, cancer substage, and BRAF mutation status. 
Key results include the following:

- Adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a significantly longer RFS compared with placebo in the 
ITT population (HR=0.57 [98.4% CI: 0.43, 0.74]; p<0.0001). The 1-year RFS rate was 75.4% (95% 
CI: 71.3, 78.9) in the pembrolizumab group versus 61.0% (95% CI: 56.5, 65.1) in the placebo group. 
• With a median duration of follow-up of 45.5 months: 
- Adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a sustained RFS benefit in the ITT population compared 
with placebo (descriptive analyses, 203 vs 288 RFS events, respectively; HR=0.59 [95% CI: 0.49, 
0.70]) [Sec. 2.7.3-melanoma9: 3.1]. The 3-year RFS rate was 63.7% and 43.5% in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups, respectively. Pembrolizumab also provided a sustained RFS 
benefit in the PD-L1-positive tumour subgroup (HR=0.59 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.73]).

(ITT Population) 
As of the DCO date (03-APR-2020) of the PRFS2 analysis for KEYNOTE-054, there were 146 second 
progression/recurrence events (including deaths) in the pembrolizumab group and 198 in the placebo 
group. Treatment with pembrolizumab resulted in longer PRFS2 than placebo (HR=0.66 [95% CI: 
0.53, 0.82]). Median PRFS2 was not yet reached in the pembrolizumab group and was 51.8 months in 
the placebo group. Although the superiority of pembrolizumab compared with placebo cannot be 
formally declared, the point estimate for the HR and the shape of the KM curve show that 
pembrolizumab provided an apparent improvement in PRFS2.

Pembrolizumab for Adjuvant Therapy in Paediatric Participants With Melanoma 
Efficacy in paediatric patients with melanoma is supported by extrapolation of efficacy data from adults 
(KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-054, KEYNOTE-716), by using specific arguments from the EU ‘Reflection 
paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for paediatrics’ October 2018. In 
addition, KEYNOTE-051 provides supportive efficacy data in cHL paediatric patients and safety data in 
paediatric patients with different tumour types.  
The MAH claims that due to a high medical need and lack of relevant efficacy data currently available 
for melanoma, an extrapolation from adult to adolescent melanoma can be made based on the 
following: (1) similarity of melanoma disease biology between adults and paediatric patients aged 12 
to 17 years, and (2) similar pharmacology of drug effect and similar exposure-response for efficacy 
and safety. Based on available PK data in KEYNOTE-051, the paediatric clinical study of 
pembrolizumab, and extrapolation of adult PK data, it was determined that 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum 
of 200 mg) q3w dosing provides appropriate exposure in paediatric patients. KEYNOTE-051 has 
resulted in the first approval for KEYTRUDA in the EU for paediatric patients with cHL. Apart from a 
cohort of 22 patients aged 11 years to 17 years with cHL, this approval was also based on 
extrapolation of pharmacology and PK data. Similar extrapolation approaches have resulted in 
approvals in other regions such as the US not only for cHL but also for PMBCL, MCC, MSI-H or dMMR 
cancer, and TMB-H cancers in the paediatric population. 
Adolescent Participants in KEYNOTE-716 
A summary of information about the 2 adolescent participants enrolled in KEYNOTE-716 is provided in 
the table below. Both participants were alive at the last contact before the DCO. 
Pembrolizumab  for  the  Treatment  of  Paediatric  Participants  With  Advanced  Cancers  in 
KEYNOTE-051 
KEYNOTE-051 is an ongoing, combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Part I and Part II), non-randomized, 
open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the PK, PD, toxicity, safety, and antitumour 
activity of pembrolizumab in paediatric participants (aged 6 months to less than 18 years) with 
advanced cancers, including melanoma. Part I has been completed and established pembrolizumab 2 
mg/kg q3w as the paediatric RP2D for Part II of the study. 
Assessment report

Page 66/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The currently available results of KEYNOTE-051 show that the safety profile of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in paediatric patients with advanced cancers is similar to that in adults. The presence or 
absence of efficacy in the small cohort of participants with advanced melanoma could not be 
definitively assessed as of the DCO date of 10-JAN-2020 for IA9, and as the cohort was open for 
additional enrolment. 
Safety Results from IA9 for Parts I and II of KEYNOTE-051 for the APaT Population 
The results of the safety analysis for KEYNOTE-051 at IA9 show that the safety profile of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in paediatric participants with advanced cancers is consistent with the 
known safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in adults for the different indications currently 
approved for adult patients in the EU. Although 57.8% of the 161 participants in the APaT population 
had one or more treatment-related AEs, pembrolizumab was well tolerated as shown by the small 
percentages of participants with Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related AEs (8.7%), treatment-related SAEs 
(9.9%), and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment (3.7%). The most 
frequently reported treatment-related AEs (fatigue, anemia, pyrexia, AST increased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, diarrhea, ALT increased, and hypothyroidism, each in >5% of participants) were consistent 
with a heavily pretreated paediatric population with advanced cancers and with the established safety 
profile of pembrolizumab in adults. 
Efficacy Results from IA9 for Parts I and II of KEYNOTE-051 for the Melanoma Cohort 
By the time of the DCO for IA9, the median duration of follow-up in the APaT population was 8.3 
months for 139 participants with advanced cancers other than Hodgkin lymphoma. Nine (5.6%) of the 
161 participants in the APaT population had advanced melanoma. Of these, 4 participants were <12 
years of age, and 5 participants were ≥12 years of age. All participants had histologically confirmed 
melanoma. There were no responders per RECIST 1.1 in the melanoma cohort. One participant had a 
best overall response of stable disease. 
The number of adolescent melanoma patients in KEYNOTE-051 was low, reflective of its rarity, and the 
disease in the patients studied was highly aggressive and rapidly progressive. Therefore KEYNOTE-051 
does not allow efficacy assessment of pembrolizumab in adolescent melanoma. The purpose of 
including KEYNOTE-051 in the current submission is to provide safety data in paediatric patients. 
Additionally, this study has shown efficacy in a cohort of cHL paediatric patients, which has resulted in 
approval for the paediatric age group of 3 years and older for patients with relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed ASCT or after at least 2 prior therapies when ASCT is not 
a treatment option. Due to similarity in disease between adults and adolescents, efficacy in patients 12 
years and older with melanoma is supported by extrapolation of efficacy data in adults (KEYNOTE- 
006, KEYNOTE-054, KEYNOTE-716).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting of Stage II 
melanoma for both adults and adolescents aged >12 years, and is proposing a paediatric indication as 
adjuvant therapy of Stage III and treatment of Stage IV melanoma, for which pembrolizumab is 
currently licensed to adults only.  
The application is based on the pivotal study KEYNOTE-716 for the Stage II melanoma indication. In 
support of the paediatric indication the MAH presents a discussion on the efficacy data of study 
KEYNOTE-054 (i.e. the registrative study for the Stage III adjuvant therapy, recently reviewed as part 
of procedure EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0100) and a claim of similarity between the adult and paediatric 
disease in terms of biology and pharmacology of drug effect. Study KEYNOTE-051, which supported 
the recently approved indication of pembrolizumab in paediatric cHL, is referred to as ground for the 
paediatric dose. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study KEYNOTE-716 is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
crossover/rechallenge, multicentre study of adjuvant pembrolizumab in participants 12 years of age 
and older with resected Stage IIB or IIC cutaneous melanoma. The study consists of Part 1 where 
patients were assigned to either pembrolizumab or placebo for a 17-cycle length of treatment, followed 
by Part 2 in which participants who completed Part 1 and experienced a recurrence were started on 
pembrolizumab regardless of the treatment received in Part 1. In the current application, only data 
from Part 1 are presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 68/128 
 
 
 
 
Study KEYNOTE-716 was the subject of a Scientific Advice pertaining clinical aspects of the trial 
including the strategy adopted to support the paediatric indication (procedure n. 
EMEA/H/SA/2437/26/2018/II). 
The study enrolled subjects with Stage IIB and IIC cutaneous melanoma based on the AJCC eighth 
edition guidelines, to include T category T3b, T4a, or T4b, with no regional nodal metastases (N0) 
confirmed by a negative SLN biopsy and no evidence of distant metastasis (M0). Participants must 
have had newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed, and completely resected melanoma with negative 
margins, and could not have received prior systemic therapy for Stage II melanoma.  
Adult participants were stratified based on T cancer staging (T3b, T4a, or T4b); this was deemed 
adequate by the CHMP in the provided Scientific Advice. It is however noted that centre effect was not 
considered, contrary to the directives of ICH E3 and ICH E9 guidelines for multicentre trials. The MAH 
argued that enrolment size in each centre was small; because of this, the 140 centres were classified 
into 3 world regions: Europe, North America and Rest of the World. 
It is noted that PD-1 expression as well as BRAF mutation status were not contemplated among 
stratification factors. Although measurement of these markers is not routinary performed in clinical 
practice for Stage II melanoma due to the current lack of licensed adjuvant therapies in this clinical 
setting (either immunological or targeted), collecting information on these biomarkers would have 
provided a characterisation of effect of treatment in the target population across relevant patient 
subgroups. Unfortunately, due to the limited availability of tissue samples in study KEYNOTE-716, the 
MAH did not consider it valuable collecting data on this aspect on the basis of the prior experience with 
KEYNOTE-054, which reported comparable responses to treatment in terms of RFS and DMFS across 
participants regardless of the BRAF mutations and PD-L1 expression status. 
The choice of the comparator (placebo) is in line with current standard-of-care considering that active 
surveillance is generally adopted in the post-surgery. Indeed, adjuvant IFN that is the only licensed 
treatment for Stage II melanoma, has been proven to reduce RFS but is not universally recommended 
owning the marginal benefit on OS despite significant toxicity. 
The administrated dose of study medication was 200 mg Q3W as licensed in other indications. For 
paediatric participants, it was determined that 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) q3w dosing 
provides appropriate exposure based on study KEYNOTE-051 together with extrapolation of adult PK 
data. Follow-up of patients recruited in the study included imaging every 6 months until year 4 and 
annually thereafter. A central revision of imaging was not contemplated by the study protocol; 
however, the double blinding nature of the trial mitigates the risk of bias. 
Treatment allocation/randomization was centrally determined using an interactive response technology 
(IRT) system and the participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to pembrolizumab or placebo. 
Details regarding the randomization method (e.g. type of randomization method, if appropriate block 
length, etc.) were provided and deemed adequate. 
The primary objective of the study was the evaluation of recurrence-free-survival (RFS) assessed by 
the investigator, which can be considered appropriate for the adjuvant setting. This was also confirmed 
by the CHMP in the prior Scientific Advice. It has been emphasized, however, that sufficient maturity of 
data and additional endpoints enabling a sound conclusion on efficacy and a proper evaluation of the 
benefit of early intervention (adjuvant) versus late treatment (at recurrence), were expected at the 
time of type II variation submission. The MAH initially submitted IA1 of the RFS that only provides a 
very early overview of inference of treatment. Indeed, this was an event driven trial where the IA1 
should have required 128 RFS events (~71% information fraction). Amount of information fraction 
required to trigger IA1 has been fully respected because the IA1 included 136 observed RFS events 
(~76% information fraction). Based on a target number of 179 events at the final analysis and 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 69/128 
 
 
 
interim analysis at approximately 71% of the target number of events, the study was estimated to 
provide a ~92% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.6 at 2.5% (1-sided) significance level. 
Progression/recurrence-free Survival 2 (PRFS2) and distant-metastasis free survival (DMFS) were 
included later in the submission. Overall survival (OS) data are not yet available. 
The sample size was calculated based on the following assumptions: i) RFS follows a “cure” model with 
a long-term RFS of 50%; ii) the 60-month RFS is estimated to be 68% for the control group; iii) 4.7% 
annual drop-out rate; enrolment period of 16 months; a follow-up period of 32 months after the last 
participant is randomized. Definition of the first two assumptions was based upon discussion with 
KOLs. The observed data revealed a higher rate of recurrences relatively to the protocol assumption. 
The poisson Mixture model was run to analyse long-term survivors. 
The initial efficacy data were based on results from IA1 and included 136 observed RFS events (~76% 
information fraction). The IA1 was triggered by prespecified protocol criteria of 128 RFS events 
observed (~71% information fraction). A sensitivity analysis excluding these overrunning patients was 
provided and confirmed IA1.   
Overall, the statistical methods are considered adequate. In particular, multiplicity strategy, censoring 
rules and sensitivity analyses are correctly specified.  However, concerns arise around the validity of 
the proposed Cox model of RFS data: considering the underlying hypothesis of the sample size 
calculation, a “cure model” was expected to be used. Moreover, the Cox model relies upon a 
proportional hazard assumption that does not seem to have been satisfied, judging by a visual 
inspection of the RFS curves. Further analyses were conducted that confirmed proportionality, 
including the Grambsch and Therneau test.  
Regarding the paediatric indication, the CHMP emphasised the concern on long-term safety sequaelae 
related to pembrolizumab toxicity profile, and the limited data on efficacy available in adolescents with 
advanced melanoma at the time of Scientific Advice application. In the current submission, the 
numerosity of the paediatric sample size remains limited to 2 patients in the pivotal KEYNOTE-716 
(one patient in each treatment arm). With Amendment 03 the originally planned separate stratum 
analysis for paediatric (age 12-17) participants was combined with the remaining population, which is 
reasonable. The only implication is that results for the paediatric population are not available. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
KEYNOTE-716 
The MAH initially presented results from IA1 (date cut-off 04 DEC 2020) on a total of 976 participants 
(487 vs 489 allocated to pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively) with 14 month length of follow-up 
in median, equally achieved between treatment arms. While 42.7% and 47.1% of subjects completed 
treatment in the pembrolizumab and control group, respectively, 27.5% and 31.3% of patients were 
still receiving study medication at the time of analysis. More discontinuations due to AE (15.5% vs 
4.1%), as expected, occurred in the pembrolizumab compared to the placebo arm, as well as more 
withdrawal by subjects (7.9% vs 5.1%). Protocol violations occurred equally in the groups with a 
low incidence, and do not appear to have compromised study conduct and analyses. 
The study population is representative of the target indication and comprises participants with Stage 
IIB and IIC cutaneous melanoma as defined by the AJCC eighth edition guidelines on cancer staging 
(i.e. T category T3b, T4a, or T4b, with no regional nodal metastases (N0) confirmed by a negative SLN 
biopsy and no evidence of distant metastasis (M0)). Participants were recruited within 12 weeks from 
complete cancer surgical removal and were treatment naïve for prior systemic therapies. Only two

Page 70/128 
 
 
 
subjects aged between 12-17 years were included, thus restricting the availability of efficacy data to 
the adult setting.   
Baseline demographic characteristics were balanced between groups. The majority of patients were 
males (60.3%), aged 61 years in median, white (89.5%) with ECOG score 0 (92.8%). The different T 
stages were well represented in the study population (T3b 41.1%; T4a 23.5%; T4b 35.2%) although 
there was a predominance of Stage IIB (64% vs 34.8% for Stage IIC). This, however, counterbalanced 
the distribution of events between the two groups so that similar contribution to the disease recurrence 
rate was observable regardless of prognosis.  Levels of PD-L1 expression as well as BRAF mutation 
status were not characterised in the study population. This is an important limiting aspect of the 
current trial in verifying homogeneity of treatment effect in the target population, especially 
considering the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape of the adjuvant setting where targeted 
therapies are currently under scrutiny and might become available. On the other side, it is 
acknowledged that response to treatment is expected to be independent from these markers 
considering that results of study KEYNOTE-054 showed similar effect regardless of PD-L1 phenotype or 
BRAF hallmark. 
Within the limit of a highly immature RFS analysis due to the low number of events (16.8% in the 
control vs 11.1% in active treatment) and elevated censoring rate from month 3 ongoing, a 
statistically significant advantage of pembrolizumab relative to placebo emerged from IA1s (HR=0.65; 
95% CI: 0.46, 0.92; p=0.00658). A sensitivity analysis that included new primary melanomas as part 
of the RFS analysis confirmed this. Despite statistical significance was reached, results were difficult to 
interpret in order to establish benefit of treatment, since 95% CI of RFS rate overlapped at all time 
points and at 24 months the rate of events turned even unfavourable in the pembrolizumab group 
compared to placebo (69.4% vs 73.8% in RFS). Moreover, one third of total patients were still 
receiving study medication, thus implying a lack of sufficient observation time in the study population 
to disentangle the cure effect from a delayed effect.  
The analysis of disease status revealed a slightly high incidence of events for all recurrence 
categories in the placebo arm (local: 4.9% vs 4.1%, lymph node: 3.5% vs 2.3%, distant: 7.8% vs 
4.7% and death:0.6% vs 0% in the control and pembrolizumab arm, respectively). However, in those 
experiencing recurrent events who were previously exposed to pembrolizumab, the use of surgical 
procedures (50% vs 43.9%), radiations (14.8% vs 4.9%) and subsequent systemic therapy (48.1% vs 
36.6%) including combined immunological treatments (18.5% vs 9.8%) and BRAF/MEK targeted 
therapies (14.8% vs 8.5%) was more frequent than in the placebo group. Results indicate that a more 
aggressive immunological approach is adopted following pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy and the 
effect by BRAF mutation status may vary. The MAH provided an updated IA2 with final RFS results, for 
an additional 6-month follow-up and a total length of observation of 20.5 months in median. With a 
recurrence rate of 23.5% in the placebo group (previously registered event rate was 16.8%), which 
was reduced to 14.8% in the pembrolizumab arm (HR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.82; p=0.00046), the 
updated results confirmed IA1; moreover, reduction in recurrence was observed for both the local-
regional (7.80% vs 10.22%) and distant (6.37% vs 12.27%) relapse of disease confirming the 
originally submitted data. A subsequent IA3 was performed with 26.9 months of follow-up, in median. 
Although immature, results from the first DMFS analysis were provided and showed a significant 
reduction of events in the pembrolizumab arm relative to placebo (HR=0.64; 95% CI 0.47, 0.88; 
p=0.00292). An updated RFS analysis was also submitted, further consolidating the initial available 
data HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.84).  
The OS was not available at the time of this procedure and this were proposed to be included in Annex 
II to obtain the analysis of other clinically relevant outcomes as soon as available.

The MAH will provide the per-protocol specified final analysis for DMFS and interim analysis for OS as 
follows: 
- 
- 
 IA4 – Q2 2023 (DMFS) 
 IA5 – Q4 2028 (OS)  
IA5 – Q4 2028 (OS) is the first IA for OS, and the results would only be provided if OS reaches 
statistical significance. If not statistically significant, the team will remain blinded until the FA currently 
planned for Q4 2033. Therefore, the IA5 is included in Annex IID, recognising that if OS is not 
statistical significance, the Annex II will be updated to reflect the FA. In general, the IAs are event-
driven and the current projected timings listed above are subject to change. 
PROs were comparable between groups. The proportions of participants for whom the change from 
baseline in the global health status score and physical functioning score had improved, remained 
stable, or deteriorated were similar in the pembrolizumab and placebo groups. Analysis of the EQ-5D-
5L score at Week 36 showed no difference between the treatment groups. As part of IA2, the MAH also 
reassessed PRO at week 48, demonstrating consistency with IA1 results (data not shown).  
Subgroup analyses showed similar effects across prespecified strata that are consistent with the ITT 
population. However, there is a trend for more attenuated treatment effect by increasing T stage (T3b 
HR:0.5; T4a HR:0.69; T4b HR:0.77) that more clearly emerges in the efficacy results by cancer stage 
(Stage IIB HR:0.44; 95% CI 0.27, 0.72; Stage IIC HR:0.94; 95% CI 0.56,1.59), demonstrating no 
benefit for patients expected to have a worse prognosis. The lower numerosity of the Stage IIC group 
(340 vs 625 patients in Stage IIB) might have limited detection of inference of treatment, bearing in 
mind that all subgroups lack statical power and ultimately a similar rate of events occurred in the two 
groups (around 16% in both placebo arms of Stage IIB and IIC at IA1). Results from IA2 showed a 
more numerous rate of events registered during the follow-up that brought the HR of RFS in Stage IIC 
toward a slight reduction (from HR=0.94, 95% CI 0.56,1.59 to HR=0.82; 95% CI 0.54, 1.26). There 
remained a divergence of effect compared to Stage IIB, for which RFS estimation is more convincingly 
in favour of pembrolizumab (HR=0.43;95% CI 0.28, 0.67). It is likely that additional updated analyses 
in RFS would consolidate the data, rather than abolishing the lack of consistency, due to the limitations 
related to the small sample size, and very few at-risk patients particularly in the final tail of the KM 
curves of stage IIC. 
Supportive studies 
KEYNOTE-054 concerns Stage III melanoma and the presented data have been the subject of a 
recently assessed procedure confirming the benefit of treatment for pembrolizumab at this stage of 
disease. Although the indication supported by the trial falls within the adjuvant setting, study 
KEYNOTE-054 does not provide efficacy data applicable to more early stages of disease and it is 
therefore of limited value. It provides, however, a comparative evaluation of clinical outcomes 
available at the time of approval of pembrolizumab as adjuvant for Stage III melanoma that further 
underlines the immaturity of Study KEYNOTE-716 in the current application. Indeed, although a similar 
length of follow-up was achieved by the two studies (15 months in KEYNOTE-054 and 14 months in 
KEYNOTE-716) at the time of first submission, study KEYNOTE-054 has registered a higher number of 
events that reflects the worse prognosis of the specific disease stage (42.8% in the placebo arm vs 
16% in the placebo arm of KN716) and results of PRFS2 were available, thus supporting the surrogate 
endpoint. It should be considered that also for study KEYNOTE-054 an updated analysis was requested 
at the time of initial submission, and those initial data found correspondence in the recently submitted 
variation (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0100) pertaining to an update of the trial with additional 30 months of 
follow-up obtained since the first interim analysis for RFS. Of particular relevance to the current 
Assessment report

Page 72/128 
 
 
 
 
application is the evidence deriving from study KEYNOTE-054 demonstrating lack of a “rebound” effect 
for pembrolizumab in the post-treatment phase of the adjuvant setting. 
Study KEYNOTE-051 provides support for the paediatric dose. Although the MAH underlines that 
efficacy data are not retrievable from this study, it should be considered that 9 paediatric cases of 
advanced melanoma were recruited (see section below). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
There are no efficacy data in the paediatric setting since only 2 subjects aged between 12-17 years 
were enrolled in the pivotal study KEYNOTE-716. The MAH claims similarity on the biological aspects of 
disease and pharmacokinetic of pembrolizumab between adults and children as a ground to a bridging 
strategy that aims at extending the use of pembrolizumab to adolescents aged >12 years in both the 
adjuvant setting of Stage II and Stage III and as treatment for advanced melanoma (Stage IV).  
The MAH discussed the scientific basis in support of disease similarity, by making references to the 
histology (the majority of adolescent cases are superficially spreading melanoma) and genetic 
alterations that are common in the two age groups. Regarding prognostic factors in the adjuvant 
setting, for completely resected melanoma in adolescent patients, it has been underlined by the MAH 
that prognostic factors are shared with adult melanoma. Similarity in therapeutic response to 
treatments was also mentioned to support the extrapolation concept, on the basis of a demonstrated 
poor performance of chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced disease in both age groups, as well 
as the use of ipilimumab that has provided proof for immunotherapy in adolescent melanoma.  
The MAH also considered Stage II and III melanoma in adults and adolescents to be the same disease, 
sharing the same prognostic factors and the high risk of recurrence and death, despite locoregional 
recurrence may occur more frequently for Stage IIB disease and systemic recurrence manifests more 
frequently for Stage IIC disease. It is acknowledged that similarity based upon biological factors 
applies to melanoma regardless of stages. There are, however, suggestions that tumour-unrelated 
clinical characteristics and the obvious better clinical conditions of the youngest patients, including 
their more active immunosurveillance status, might influence clinical outcomes. In the setting of a 
metastatic disease, these differences are not relevant due to the advanced status of melanoma but for 
earliest stages of disease, they should be factored into the equation to better define prognosis and the 
consequent weight of benefit against risks associated to treatment. Clinical observations on efficacy 
are currently very limited and inconclusive (9 participants, only 5 in the adolescent age range), and 
actually show a negative trend in terms of response. However, the biological similarity of disease is 
recognised and provides support to the proposed extrapolation.  
Due to limited number of paediatric melanoma patients, the MAH did not provide information on the 
exposure-response relationship between adult and paediatric patients in melanoma. No additional 
analysis has been conducted, neither for PK or exposure-response relationship. Therefore, the 
conclusion on similar pharmacology of drug effect is based on data from KEYNOTE-051 
(EMEA/H/C/3820/II/090) and during the II/90 variation assessment it was concluded that “since 
consistent flat exposure-response relationships are seen for pembrolizumab in multiple tumour types 
and since clearance is not meaningfully different across tumour types, this can suggest that saturation 
of the target in circulation is achieved at the clinical dose across all tumour types”. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Pembrolizumab-induced reduction of disease recurrence (including both loco-regional and distant 
patterns) during the limited and initial period of follow-up as demonstrated in study KEYNOTE-716 can 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 73/128 
 
 
 
be regarded as clinically relevant. It remains to be excluded that anticipation of pembrolizumab as 
adjuvant therapy merely produces a delaying effect on disease relapse with no benefit on the overall 
survival compared to a delayed treatment at recurrence. The behaviour of disease cannot be predicted 
in the post-treatment phase on the basis of the current K-M curves, not only because of the immature 
analysis but also in consideration of the fact that immunosurveillance might be influenced by cessation 
of therapy, thus concurring to delineate a different progression of disease. In this context, the prior 
experience with KEYNOYE-054 can be considered supportive, and show lack of a “rebound” effect upon 
therapy cessation, thus providing reassurance on the maintenance of treatment benefit at later time 
points in the adjuvant setting. Although efficacy can be considered substantiated in this new indication, 
results require confirmation through a longer follow-up and additional clinically relevant outcomes. 
The MAH will provide the per-protocol specified final analysis for DMFS and IA for OS as follows: 
- 
- 
 IA4 – Q2 2023 (DMFS) [included in Annex IID] 
 IA5 – Q4 2028 (OS) [included in Annex IID] 
The proposed bridging strategy in support of a paediatric indication currently lacks direct evidence of 
exposure-response relationships in adolescent melanoma. Clinical observations on efficacy are also 
very limited. The biological similarity of disease, however, is recognised and provides support to the 
proposed extrapolation. As regards pharmacology, only an indirect conclusion on E-R can be drawn 
based on the demonstrated similarity in E-R relationship and PK profile between adult and paediatric 
patients in cHL, and the assumption that the flat exposure-response relationship seen in adults across 
multiple tumour types is preserved in paediatric patients across indications. Even though carrying all 
these limitations, the bridging strategy adopted by the MAH could be deemed acceptable within the 
specific tumour-type, considering the historically recognised immunoresponsive nature of melanoma, 
and taking into account that extrapolation is limited to adolescents. Indeed, in this clinical setting, no 
factors potentially affecting response to therapy are foreseen. A commitment, however, is requested to 
the MAH for prospectively collecting as much post-authorisation data as possible (on efficacy and 
safety outcomes) on paediatric/adolescent treated patients in the approved indication(s), e.g., in a 
study (or registry) post marketing authorisation and, regarding the melanoma indications, making the 
distinction between adjuvant and advanced setting. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of 
pembrolizumab as adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with Stage 
IIB or IIC melanoma, the MAH should submit the per-protocol specified final analysis of DMFS and the 
interim analysis of OS for study KN716: A Phase III Clinical Trial of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in 
Subjects with complete resection of high-risk Stage II melanoma. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety results of pembrolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 
12 years and older with Stage IIB and IIC melanoma who have undergone complete resection, are 
presented for the following 3 datasets: 
•  KEYNOTE-716 Safety Dataset (N= 969), including pembrolizumab-treated participants 
(n=483) and participants who received placebo (n=486) with resected Stage IIB and IIC 
melanoma in KEYNOTE-716 (DCO date 04 DEC 2020); 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 74/128 
 
 
 
•  KEYNOTE-054 Safety Dataset (N=509), including pembrolizumab-treated participants with 
resected, lymph node -positive, Stage III melanoma who participated in KEYNOTE-054 (DCO 
date 03-APR-2020); 
•  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD (N=6185), including 6185 pembrolizumab-treated 
participants with advanced melanoma from studies KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, and 
KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-054 and participants with NSCLC from studies KEYNOTE-001, 
KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE-024, and KEYNOTE-042. In addition, this dataset includes 
participants from KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 3, KEYNOTE-087, and KEYNOTE-204 (cHL), KEYNOTE-
012, KEYNOTE-040, KEYNOTE-048, and KEYNOTE-055 (HNSCC), KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-
052 (urothelial cancer), and KEYNOTE-177 (CRC). This dataset represents the established 
safety profile for pembrolizumab. 
Patient exposure 
KEYNOTE-716 is the first study of adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab in participants with resected 
Stage IIB and IIC melanoma. The treatment phase of the study consists of 2 parts: 
Part 1: Adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab or placebo administered IV Q3W (200 mg for 
participants ≥18 years of age or 2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg for participants ≥12 years and 
<18 years of age) for a total of 17 administrations (~1 year) or until disease recurrence or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Part 2: For participants who developed disease recurrence during Part 1, optional crossover or 
rechallenge treatment with pembrolizumab administered IV Q3W for 17 administrations (~1 year) 
after resection of recurrent disease or up to 35 administrations (~2 years) for unresectable disease 
recurrence or unresectable distant recurrence, or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. 
The safety analyses were conducted using the APaT population, which included all participants who 
were enrolled in Part 1 of KEYNOTE-716 and who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab or placebo 
as of the DCO date of 04-DEC-2020. The median duration of follow-up as of the DCO was 14.3 months 
(range: 1.0 to 26.4 months). The median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-716 was 
similar to KEYNOTE-054 and was more than twice as long as the duration of exposure in the RSD 
(9.9 months, 11.8 months, and 4.9 months, respectively) (Table 1).

Adverse events 
Summary of adverse events 
A comparison of safety parameters between the pembrolizumab and placebo groups of KEYNOTE-716 
Safety Dataset, the RSD, and the consistency with KEYNOTE-054 are the focus of this summary. AEs 
were coded using MedDRA (Version 23.1) and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0. In Table 4 the summary of adverse event 
is reported.

As provided, the exposure-adjusted incidence of AE category was either consistent or lower in the 
pembrolizumab group of KEYNOTE-716 compared with the RSD, except for drug-related AEs and AEs 
resulting in treatment discontinuation (Table 5).

Events) (APaT Population) 
Common adverse events 
The overall incidences of AEs in KEYNOTE-716 were similar in the pembrolizumab and placebo groups. 
AEs that occurred at a higher incidence in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group, and 
with the greatest difference in incidence (≥8 percentage points) between the treatment groups, were 
diarrhoea, pruritus, rash, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism (Fig. 1). The most frequently reported 
AEs (incidence >20%) in KEYNOTE-716, fatigue, diarrhoea, pruritus, and arthralgia, were similar to 
the most frequently reported AEs in KEYNOTE-054 and were generally consistent with the RSD (Table 
6).

Drug-related Adverse Events 
The treatment-related AEs of pruritus, rash, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism were reported at 
higher incidences in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group. The incidence and types of 
drug-related AEs in the different datasets are reported in Table 5. The most frequently reported drug-
related AEs (incidence >10%) in KEYNOTE-716, pruritus, fatigue, diarrhoea, rash, hypothyroidism, and 
arthralgia, were consistent with the most frequently reported drug-related AEs in KEYNOTE-054 (Table 
7).

Grade 3 to 5 Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of Grade 3 to 5 AEs was higher in the pembrolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group. The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs (in ≥1.0% of participants in either

treatment group) were hypertension, diarrhoea, rash, autoimmune hepatitis, ALT increased, colitis, 
and lipase increased but no clinically meaningful difference was observed between the pembrolizumab 
and placebo groups in the incidences of these Grade 3 to 5 AEs (Fig. 2) 
Table  8  displays  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  (incidence  ≥1%)  in

Deaths Due to Adverse Events 
No participants in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group and 4 participants in the placebo group had 
an AE that resulted in death during the study or follow-up period. None of the deaths were reported as 
drug related.

The overall incidence of SAEs was similar in the pembrolizumab and placebo groups (18.8% and 
17.5%, respectively). Basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma in situ, and squamous cell carcinoma 
were the most frequently reported SAEs (in >1.0% of participants in either treatment group) (Fig. 3).

Drug-related Serious Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of treatment-related SAEs was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the 
placebo group (9.1% vs. 1.9%). The most frequently reported treatment-related SAEs in the 
pembrolizumab group were adrenal insufficiency and colitis, each reported for 4 participants (0.8%) 
(Table 11). Overall, the incidences and types of drug-related SAEs in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab 
group were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 (12.2%) and generally consistent with the RSD (11.3%)

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
Summary of Adverse Event of Special Interest 
In KEYNOTE-716, the overall incidence of AEOSI was higher in the pembrolizumab group (36.2%) 
compared with the placebo group (8.4%). Fewer than 10% of participants in the pembrolizumab group 
discontinued study treatment due to an AEOSI (Table 13). In the pembrolizumab group, the median 
time to onset of participants’ first AEOSI episode was 64.0 days and the median duration of AEOSI 
episodes in the pembrolizumab group was 193.0 days, with an average of 1.5 AEOSI episodes per 
participant. The most frequently reported AEOSI in the pembrolizumab group were hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism, similar to those reported in KEYNOTE-054 and generally consistent with the RSD 
(Table 142). Most AEOSI were Grade 1 or Grade 2 and the use of systemic corticosteroids was 
reported for management of some or all episodes of AEOSI, with the following exceptions: 
hyperthyroidism, infusion reactions, pancreatitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and uveitis. In addition, the 
exposure-adjusted incidences of AEOSI were generally similar between KEYNOTE-716, KEYNOTE-054 
and the RSD (Table 15).

Laboratory findings 
Changes over time from baseline laboratory measurements were generally representative of the pre-
existing, underlying disease state. In KEYNOTE-716 most changes in toxicity grade from baseline to 
the worst post-baseline value were changes to toxicity Grades ≤2 (Table 16). The proportions of 
participants in KEYNOTE-716 who had at least 1 postbaseline abnormality in ALT or AST (i.e., toxicity 
Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4) were 28.9% and 24.2%, respectively in the pembrolizumab group, compared with 
14.6% and 12.3%, respectively in the placebo group. Shifts to a highest postbaseline value of Grades 
3 and 4 were reported for the following laboratory test results in >1% of participants in the 
pembrolizumab arm (vs. placebo group): lymphocytes decreased (2.9% vs. 3.3%), GGT increased 
(2.2% vs. 1.5%), ALT increased (2.5% vs. 0.4%), cholesterol increased (2.7% vs. 0%), and AST 
increased (1.5% vs. 0.8).

VITAL SIGNS, PHYSICAL FINDINGS, AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO SAFETY 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in vital signs over time between the pembrolizumab 
and placebo groups in KEYNOTE-716. No new safety concerns based on vital signs changes or other 
observations were reported in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses in KEYNOTE-716 based on intrinsic (age, sex, ECOG performance status) and 
extrinsic factors (region) are reported below.  
Intrinsic Factors

Higher incidences of some AE categories were reported for participants in the pembrolizumab group 
compared with those in the placebo group when compared by age, sex, and ECOG performance status. 
Age 
The AE profile across age groups (<65 years, 65-74 years, and 75-84 years) in the KEYNOTE-716 
pembrolizumab group was similar to what was observed across the age groups in KEYNOTE-054 and 
generally consistent with the RSD (Table 17). A summary of AEs by age and categories of interest 
analysed (central nervous system-confusion/extrapyramidal, AE related to falling, cardiovascular 
events, cerebrovascular events, and infections) has been also presented (Table 18).

ECOG Performance Status 
The AE profile was generally similar between participants with an ECOG status of 0 and 1 in the 
KEYNOTE 716 pembrolizumab group, which was similar to the pattern observed in KEYNOTE 054 and 
was generally consistent with the RSD (Table 2018).

Region 
The overall incidence of AEs in EU and non-EU participants was similar in the pembrolizumab and

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies have been performed. However, as pembrolizumab is 
an IgG antibody administrated parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and DDI are not able to 
influence exposure, and drugs that affect cytochrome P450 enzymes are not expected to interfere with 
the metabolism of pembrolizumab. Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with 
pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, the use of systemic corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided because of their potential interference with the 
pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of pembrolizumab, although these drugs can be used to treat 
immune-related adverse reactions during the pembrolizumab treatment. Corticosteroids can also be 
used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, as antiemetic 
prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy related adverse reactions. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
As of the DCO, no pregnancies were reported in the KEYNOTE-716 Safety Dataset. Pembrolizumab 
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. It 
is not known whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs and IgG 
antibodies are secreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue the drug, considering the importance of the drug to the mother. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No withdrawal or rebound effects are expected with an anti-PD-1 mAb, and none has been observed in 
pembrolizumab clinical studies to date. 
Effect on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
Assessment report

Impairment of cognitive ability is not expected from an anti-PD-1 mAb. No additional studies have 
been conducted to determine the effect of pembrolizumab on the impairment of mental function or the 
ability to drive or operate machinery.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The overall incidence of AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment in KEYNOTE-716 was higher 
in the pembrolizumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group (4.5%). However, it was 
similar to KEYNOTE-054 (13.9%) and the RSD (13.5%) (Table 22). Most AEs leading to discontinuation 
of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE 716 occurred in <1% of participants, except for colitis and autoimmune 
hepatitis (1.0% each). These AEs were similar to the most frequently reported AEs leading to 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-054. 
Table 22. Participants With Adverse Events Resulting in Treatment Discontinuation  
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The overall incidence of treatment-related AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment in 
KEYNOTE-716 was higher in the pembrolizumab group (15.3%) than in the placebo group (2.5%), and 
was similar to KEYNOTE-054 (12.2%) but higher than the RSD (7.2%) (Table 23). Each PT for an AE 
that led to discontinuation of study treatment was reported for ≤1.0% of participants in each treatment 
group. The most frequently reported of these AEs were colitis and autoimmune hepatitis (1%, each) in 
the pembrolizumab group, diarrhoea and autoimmune hepatitis (0.4%, each) in the placebo group. 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-716 were similar to the 
most frequently reported drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-
054.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The overall incidence of AEs that led to interruption of study treatment in KEYNOTE-716 was similar in 
the pembrolizumab group (20.3%) and KEYNOTE-054 (19.3%) but was slightly lower than the RSD 
(25.8%) (Table 242). The most frequently reported AEs resulting in study treatment interruption in the 
pembrolizumab group (in >1.0% of participants) were diarrhoea (2.3%); arthralgia (1.7%); 
hyperthyroidism, cough, and pyrexia (each in 1.2% of participants). In the placebo group, the most 
frequently reported AEs resulting in study treatment interruption were diarrhoea and pyrexia (each in 
1.2% of participants). These AEs were similar to the most frequently reported AEs leading to 
pembrolizumab interruption in KEYNOTE 054.

Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs that led to interruption of study treatment in KEYNOTE 716 
was higher in the pembrolizumab group (14.1%) compared with the placebo group (5.3%), similar to 
KEYNOTE-054 (14.5%) and the RSD (14.6%) (Table 253). The most frequently reported drug-related 
AEs leading to pembrolizumab interruption (incidence >1%) in KEYNOTE 716 were arthralgia (1.7%), 
diarrhoea (1.7%), and hyperthyroidism (1.2%); diarrhoea (1%) in the placebo group.

Post marketing experience 
No further data besides those included in the last PSUR have been submitted, covering the period 04-
Sep-2019 through 03-Sep-2020. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The first patient, was diagnosed with melanoma approximately 3 months and 28 days prior to the first 
dose of pembrolizumab. The patient was newly diagnosed with Stage IIB cutaneous melanoma 
confirmed by histology, which was completely resected, and had negative SLN biopsy prior to 
enrolment. At screening, KPS score was 100 and T4aN0M0. Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV Q3W was 
started on Day 1 (Cycle 1) for the treatment of resected high-risk Stage II melanoma and the patient 
received 17 cycles during the study. The participant entered the study with a history of acne, cystic 
acne, and hidradenitis, treated with oral clindamycin, which was stopped on Day -14. On Day 41 the 
dose of pembrolizumab was given (Cycle 3), and on Day 58, the patient experienced hidradenitis 
(Grade 1) in the left axilla. Treatment with topical fusidic acid was started on Day 62 and hidradenitis 
resolved on Day 69 (while fusidic acid was stopped on Day 70). On Day 104, the dose of 
pembrolizumab was given (Cycle 6), and on Day 124, the participant had a second episode of 
worsening of left axilla hidradenitis (Grade 1). No treatment was reported, and no further information 
was available. On Day 293 increased WBCs was observed (Table 27). On Day 314 the dose of 
pembrolizumab was given (Cycle 15), and on Day 335, the participant was diagnosed with increased 
lymphocyte count (Grade 2, Table 27). No treatment was reported, and increased lymphocyte count 
resolved on Day 356. On Day 356 the participant completed pembrolizumab; as of Day 425, last 
contact before data cut-off, the participant was alive. The investigator considered the non-serious AEs 
of hidradenitis (2 episodes) and increased lymphocyte count as not related to pembrolizumab.

The second patient, was diagnosed with melanoma approximately 4 months and 5 days prior to the 
first dose of study medication. The patient was newly diagnosed with Stage IIB cutaneous melanoma 
confirmed by histology, which was completely resected, and had negative SLN biopsy prior to 
enrolment. At screening, KPS score was 100 and T3bN0M0. Placebo (saline solution) IV Q3W was 
started on Day 1 (Cycle 1) after being randomized in the study due to high-risk Stage II melanoma. 
The patient had received 14 cycles at the time of data cut-off, and at the time of data cut-off, no

alive. 
Comparative analysis of paediatric/adult safety data post RSI 
The safety of pembrolizumab has been assessed in the paediatric participants in the ongoing study 
KEYNOTE-051, with 161 participants, aged 9 months to 17 years old, in the ASaT population. Safety 
results from the analysis of KEYNOTE-051 in a paediatric population with advanced cancers support 
that the safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy is consistent with the known safety profile of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in adults from the different indications approved so far for adults in the 
EU. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was generally well tolerated in paediatric participants who have solid 
tumours and lymphoma. No new safety signals were observed. Additionally, in KEYNOTE-051 there 
were no treatment-emergent positive ADA found in 125 paediatric participants with evaluable 
immunogenicity samples and these results were comparable to the ADA data in adults reported in the 
pembrolizumab development program. 
As requested, a comparative analysis of the safety data from paediatric participants in KEYNOTE-051 
and adult melanoma participants in the adjuvant setting (KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054) and adults 
with advanced melanoma was conducted using 4 safety datasets as presented: 
1.  Safety data from the paediatric melanoma patients in KEYNOTE-051 (N=9).  
2.  The cumulative safety data from KEYNOTE-051 (N=161). 
3.  Pooled safety data from the 2 adjuvant melanoma studies (KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054) 
(N=992).  
4.  Pooled safety dataset for adults with advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, 
KEYNOTE-006) (N=1567). 
Overall Extent of Exposure. The median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab for the paediatric 
melanoma participants in KEYNOTE-051 is 1.4 months. Overall, the median duration of exposure in 
KEYNOTE-051 is 2.1 months. The median duration of exposure in the pooled adjuvant population 
(KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054) dataset is 11.1 months, which is twice the duration of exposure of 
that in the advanced adult melanoma safety dataset (5.1 months) (Table 28).

Analysis of Adverse Events. The incidences of drug-related AEs, drug-related SAEs and drug-related 
Grade 3 to 5 AEs were generally consistent across all the datasets (Table 29). 
Table 29. Adverse Event Summary (APaT Population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 110/128 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of AEOSI (immune-related AEs and infusion reactions) in KEYNOTE-051, 
(18.6%), is comparable with the adult advanced melanoma dataset (22.9%) as well as for Grade ≥ 3 
AEOSI, serious AEOSI, and discontinuations due to an AEOSI (Table 30). The nature and severity of 
AEOSI in the paediatric melanoma participants and in KEYNOTE-051 paediatric participants were 
comparable to that of the adult adjuvant and advanced melanoma participants. The majority of 
participants across the datasets reported AEOSI severity of Grade 1 or Grade 2. One participant in 
KEYNOTE-051 reported Grade 5 pneumonitis. The fatal AEOSI of pneumonitis was in a participant with 
extensive right chest involvement of the underlying epithelioid sarcoma.

The sample size of participants in the paediatric melanoma safety datasets (n=9) and KEYNOTE-051 
(n=161) are relatively small, when compared to the pooled adjuvant melanoma safety dataset 
(n=992) and the adult advanced melanoma safety dataset (n=1567). There are differences in the 
duration of exposure across the datasets. After adjusting for duration of exposure in the datasets, the 
incidence of AEs or AEOSI in the paediatric melanoma dataset and KEYNOTE-051 remains generally 
consistent with the adult advanced melanoma safety dataset. The exposure-adjusted incidence of 
AEOSI in the paediatric melanoma and KEYNOTE-051 safety datasets were generally similar to the 
exposure-adjusted incidence in the adult advanced melanoma safety dataset and lower than in the 
pooled adjuvant melanoma safety dataset (Table 31).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To support the proposed use of pembrolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of adult and paediatric (12 
years and older) patients with Stage IIB and IIC melanoma following complete resection, safety results 
have been presented from study KEYNOTE-716, a randomized, placebo controlled, multicentre study 
with a total population of 483 Stage IIB and IIC melanoma treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 113/128 
 
 
 
 
as adjuvant therapy (or 2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg for participants ≥12 years of age and 
<18 years of age) (APaT population), in comparison with a control arm (placebo) of 486 patients (1:1 
randomisation scheme) (Part 1 of the study; DCO date 04-DEC-2020). Additional safety comparative 
data are provided based on the prior clinical experience of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the 
adjuvant treatment setting (KEYNOTE-054) in 509 patients with resected, lymph node-positive, Stage 
III melanoma (DCO date 03-APR-2020) as well as the totality of clinical trials conducted so far 
(Reference Safety Dataset; N=6185). 
In KEYNOTE-716, the demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups. Most participants were male, white, not Hispanic or Latino, and 
were from EU regions (in the RSD, more participants were enrolled at sites outside the EU). 
Participants in the KEYNOTE-716 Safety Dataset were generally younger, had better ECOG 
performance status at study entry, and did not have evidence of metastatic disease compared with 
those in the RSD (most [93.2%] participants in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group had an ECOG 
performance status of 0). The age of participants ranged from 16 to 87 years, with a median age of 61 
years. Of note, only one adolescent patient in the pembrolizumab arm, and one adolescent patient in 
the placebo group were enrolled in KEYNOTE-716. The median duration of exposure to 
pembrolizumab was similar to that in KEYNOTE-054 (9.9 months and 11.8 months, respectively), but 
twice as long as the median duration of exposure in the RSD (4.9 months). In the pembrolizumab and 
placebo groups, 69.8% and 78.6% of participants had at least 6 months of exposure respectively, 
similar to KEYNOTE-054 (76%) but higher than the RSD (45.4%). 
As expected, the comparison with the placebo showed an unfavourable safety profile of pembrolizumab 
in the adjuvant setting of resectable melanoma: the drug-related AEs (79.9% vs. 60.9% in the placebo 
group), the incidence of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (16.1 % vs. 4.3%), drug-related SAEs (9.1% vs. 
1.9%), drug discontinuations due to either drug-related AEs (15.3% vs. 2.5%) or drug-related SAEs 
(6.8% vs. 2.5%) were all more frequent in the experimental group compared to control.  
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was consistent with prior experience, although it must be 
acknowledged that a lower incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs and drug-related AEs leading to death 
were reported in KEYNOTE-716 compared to KEYNOTE-054 and the reference datasets (SAEs: 18.8% 
vs. 25% in KN-054 vs. 38.3% in RSD; Grade 3-5 AEs 25.9% vs. 31.8% in KN-054 vs. 48.8% in RSD). 
This is likely to be explained by the younger age and better clinical performance as well as the nature 
of cancer disease in the KEYNOTE-716 study population, without evidence of metastatic disease and 
with better ECOG performance status at study entry. The incidences of drug-related SAEs and drug-
related grade 3 to 5 AEs were generally consistent with the RSD, whereas the incidence of drug-related 
AEs leading to discontinuation and of AEOSIs were higher in KEYNOTE-716 than the RSD, similarly to 
the KN-054 (discontinuation due to drug-related AEs: 15.3% in KN-716; 12.2% in KN-054; 7.2% in 
RSD; AEOSI: 36.2% vs. 35.2% vs. 25.5%, respectively). The longer duration of exposure to 
pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-716 may have contributed to the higher incidence of drug-related AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation compared with the RSD. After adjusting for exposure, the 
incidence of AEOSI and AEOSI leading to treatment discontinuation were partially corrected for 
KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054. As requested, the summary of adverse events after adjusting for 
duration of exposure in the different safety datasets has been provided. The incidences by AE category 
were consistent or lower in the pembrolizumab group of KEYNOTE-716 compared with the RSD and no 
new safety concerns have been identified. 
In KEYNOTE-716, the most frequently reported AEs were generally similar between the 
pembrolizumab and the placebo groups, despite the higher incidences for diarrhoea, pruritus, rash, 
hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism, which are known ADRs for pembrolizumab. Overall, the 
incidences, types, and severity of AEs in KEYNOTE-716 were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 114/128 
 
 
 
generally consistent with the RSD, despite some differences (≥5 percentage points difference) 
compared with the RSD, including diarrhoea (26.7% vs. 20.9%), hyperthyroidism (10.4% vs. 4.2%), 
and pruritus (25.9 vs. 18%). 
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs in KEYNOTE-716 was higher in the pembrolizumab group 
compared with the placebo group. Pruritus, rash, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism were reported 
at higher incidences in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group (most of these of 
toxicity Grade 1 or 2). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (incidence >10%) in KEYNOTE 
716, pruritus, fatigue, diarrhoea, rash, hypothyroidism, and arthralgia, were consistent with the most 
frequently reported drug-related AEs in KEYNOTE-054, but higher than the RSD. In particular, a 
prevalence of endocrine disturbances has been observed in the experimental group, being higher than 
previously reported (hypothyroidism 14.5% vs. 9.8% in the RSD; hyperthyroidism 9.9% vs. 3.7%, 
respectively). More details have been provided on thyroid abnormalities observed in the adjuvant 
setting. In the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group, 70 (14.5%) patients reported drug-related 
hypothyroidism and 48 (9.9%) patients reported drug-related hyperthyroidism. Of the 70 patients with 
hypothyroidism and of 48 patients with hyperthyroidism, 4 patients each had preexisting thyroid 
disorders. Based on this evaluation, the number of participants with preexisting thyroid disorders was 
low and may not have affected the incidence of drug-related hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in 
KEYNOTE-716. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (listed, respectively, as a very common and a 
common ADR for pembrolizumab monotherapy) are known ADRs for pembrolizumab and are listed 
under section 4.4 (Special Warnings and Precautions), and in section 4.8 (Undesirable Effect) of the 
SmPC.  
Recently, the incidence of immune-related adverse events in the adjuvant setting has been a topic for 
review in the procedure EMEA/H/C/3820/II/0108 for adjuvant treatment of RCC. The wording in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the incidences of AEOSI in the adjuvant vs. the 
metastatic setting. Therefore, the proposed wording under “Pembrolizumab in monotherapy” and 
“Immune-related endocrinopathies” reflects the safety data of patients with RCC and melanoma 
treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant setting (n=1,480), confirming the higher 
incidences of AEOSI in this setting. The overall incidence of Grade 3 to 5 AEs in KEYNOTE-716 was 
higher in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group (25.9% vs. 17.1%) and lower 
than KEYNOTE-054 and the RSD (31.8% and 48.2%, respectively). The only grade 3 to 5 AEs reported 
more frequently in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab arm than KEYNOTE-054 and the RSD were rash 
(1.4% vs. 0.4% vs. 0.5%) and autoimmune hepatitis (1.2% vs. 0.6% vs. 0.3%, respectively), for 
which the contribution of the immune dysregulation induced by pembrolizumab cannot be excluded. No 
Grade 5 AEs occurred in the pembrolizumab arm. The overall incidence of Grade 3 to 5 drug-
related AEs in KEYNOTE-716 was higher in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo 
group (16.1% vs. 4.3%, respectively). The incidences and types of Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs in 
the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 and generally 
consistent with the RSD (16.1% vs. 14.5% vs. 15.8%). The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 
drug-related AEs (incidence ≥1%) in the pembrolizumab group were rash (1.4%), autoimmune 
hepatitis (1.2%), colitis (1%) and diarrhoea (1%), slightly higher than those reported in KEYNOTE-054 
and the RSD (except for colitis 1.4% in KN-054). As requested, details on the treatment and on the 
clinical outcomes on autoimmune hepatitis have been provided. In particular, the majority (80%) of 
participants in the pembrolizumab group of KEYNOTE-716 (and the RSD) that reported drug-related 
autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis had outcomes reported as resolved or resolving at the time of the 
DCO. Regarding the gastrointestinal toxicities that may lead to dehydration, the incidence of diarrhoea 
and vomiting was comparable between KEYNOTE-716 and the RSD and was as expected also in the 
paediatric setting.

The incidence of SAEs in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group was lower than in the KEYNOTE 054 
and the RSD (18.8% vs. 25% vs. 38.3%). However, the types of SAEs in the KEYNOTE 716 
pembrolizumab group were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 and generally consistent with the RSD. 
SAEs reported more frequently in KEYNOTE-716 than in the RSD included basal cell carcinoma, 
malignant melanoma in situ and squamous cell carcinoma. The similar incidences of basal cell 
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054 are consistent with the 
incidences observed in patients with melanoma (similar incidences were also observed in placebo arm 
in KEYNOTE-716). 
The overall incidence of treatment-related SAEs was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the 
placebo group (9.1% vs. 1.9%). Overall, the incidences and types of drug-related SAEs in the 
KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 (12.2%) and generally 
consistent with the RSD (11.3%). In KEYNOTE-716, the most frequently reported treatment-related 
SAEs in the pembrolizumab group were adrenal insufficiency and colitis (each reported for 4 
participants). Adrenal insufficiency and colitis are known ADRs for pembrolizumab. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitor (ICI)-associated primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare adverse event that is important to 
recognize because it may be severe and life-threatening, requiring emergent and often lifelong 
hormonal replacement therapy. The risk of injury of other organ systems and endocrine disease has 
been noted (i.e., with severe acute kidney injury, occasional cases of cardiotoxicity, including 
myocarditis). Awareness regarding this ICI-related endocrinopathy is strongly encouraged among 
clinicians in addition to patient education about common primary adrenal insufficiency symptoms that 
should prompt urgent medical evaluation. In clinical practice, close monitoring and investigation for 
adrenal insufficiency is crucial to allow for early management and to further define the pathophysiology 
and prognosis of ICI-adrenal insufficiency (Grouthier V et al. Oncologist 2020) Corticotrophin 
(adrenocorticotrophic hormone) circulating level evaluation may be often lacking but should be 
considered as part of the diagnostic workup to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from 
secondary (central) adrenal insufficiency. The MAH has summarized the data and the outcomes of the 
cases with adrenal insufficiency related to pembrolizumab. In KEYNOTE-716, drug-related adrenal 
insufficiency was reported in 11 (2.3%) participants that received pembrolizumab, in 7 participants 
with maximum toxicity of ≤ Grade 2, and in 4 participants as Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency. All 
patients, with one exception, required systemic corticosteroid therapy and events were reported as 
resolved or resolving in 6 out of 11 patients. Adrenal insufficiency is reported in the SmPC, described 
in section 4.4 (Warnings and Precautions) and listed as uncommon ADR in section 4.8 (Undesirable 
effects) of the SmPC. Based on this evaluation, no additional warning is necessary in the SmPC. 
The nature and severity of AEOSIs in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group were consistent with 
the established safety profile of pembrolizumab. No new immune-related AEs for pembrolizumab were 
identified. Overall, incidences, types and severity of AEOSIs in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab arm 
were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054, but higher than those reported in the RSD (36.2% vs. 35.2% 
vs. 25.5%, respectively), probably mainly driven by increased incidences of hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism (15.7% and 10.4% in KEYNOTE-716 vs. 11.3% and 4.2% in RSD, respectively). 
AEOSIs were manageable with treatment interruption, discontinuation and/or corticosteroid therapy 
and none were fatal. Among participants in the pembrolizumab group, most (54.9%) had AEOSIs that 
were resolved or resolving at the time of the DCO. AEOSIs that were unresolved included 
endocrinopathies (i.e., hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and type 1 
diabetes mellitus) requiring long-term hormone replacement therapy. In particular, the incidence of 
adrenal insufficiency in KEYNOTE-716 (2.3%) was higher than in the RSD (0.8%), likewise, the 
incidence of hypophysitis in KEYNOTE-716 (2.1%) was higher than in the RSD (0.6%). However, the 
incidence of immune-related hypothyroidism, thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus were comparable 
across the datasets. Overall, the proportion of participants in KEYNOTE-716 with immune-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 116/128 
 
 
 
endocrinopathies that were unresolved and required hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was 
consistent with that previously observed in the adjuvant treatment of resected Stage III melanoma 
with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-054. In detail, a total of 18.6% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm 
of KEYNOTE-716 received HRT for endocrinopathies (compared with 12.6% of patients in 
pembrolizumab arm of KEYNOTE-054), and hypothyroidism was the most frequently occurring 
endocrinopathy requiring HRT. In conclusion, the findings from KEYNOTE-716 for endocrinopathies 
were consistent with the known safety profile of pembrolizumab and no additional warning is necessary 
in the SmPC. 
No new safety concerns based on laboratory abnormalities were reported in the KEYNOTE-716 
pembrolizumab group. The most frequently reported post baseline laboratory abnormalities in the 
KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group were generally consistent with KEYNOTE-054 and the RSD. 
No participants in the pembrolizumab group died due to an AE; 4 participants in the placebo group had 
an AE that resulted in death during the study or follow-up period and none of the deaths were reported 
as related to study treatment. 
The incidences and types of AEs leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-716 
Safety Dataset were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 and were generally consistent with the RSD 
(15.9% vs. 13.9% vs. 13.5%, respectively). Conversely, incidences of drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054 were higher than in the RSD 
(15.3% vs. 12.2% vs. 7.2%, respectively) (of note, participants in KEYNOTE-716 had 2 times longer 
median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab than participants in the RSD). Most drug-related AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-716 occurred in <1% of the 
participants, except for colitis and autoimmune hepatitis (1.0% each), with a similar frequency 
reported in KEYNOTE-054 but higher than those reported in the RSD (colitis: 1.2% and 0.5%, 
respectively; autoimmune hepatitis: 0.4% and 0.2%). Colitis and autoimmune hepatitis are AEOSIs for 
which treatment interruption or discontinuation is recommended, depending on the severity of the AE. 
The types of drug-related AEs leading to pembrolizumab interruption in the KEYNOTE-716 
Safety Dataset were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 and the RSD, but with a slightly higher 
frequency in KEYNOTE-716 for some drug-related AEs (arthralgia: 1.7% vs. 1.4% vs. 0.6%; 
hyperthyroidism: 1.2% vs. 0.4% vs. 0.2%, respectively). These findings suggest that the overall 
tolerability of pembrolizumab among participants in KEYNOTE-716 was generally consistent with what 
was previously observed in the adjuvant melanoma KEYNOTE-054 Safety Dataset, but the higher 
incidences of endocrinopathies in this population could represent a concern. 
Subgroup analyses in KEYNOTE-716 based on intrinsic (age, sex, ECOG performance status) and 
extrinsic factors (region) were also performed. 
There was an age-dependent increase in Grade 3-5 AEs, Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs and SAEs in the 
pembrolizumab arm. Tolerability to pembrolizumab was particularly reduced in patients aged ≥75 
years compared to younger subgroups (23.1% vs. 12.7% in patients <65 years old for drug-related 
grade 3-5 AEs; 38.5% vs. 15.8% in patients <65 years old for SAEs), in parallel to higher incidence of 
discontinuation due to an adverse event (23.1% vs. 14% in patients <65 years old for discontinuation 
due to an AE; 23.1% vs. 13% in patients <65 years old for discontinuation due to a drug-related AE). 
Additionally, a summary of AEs by age and categories of interest analysed (central nervous system-
confusion/extrapyramidal, AE related to falling, cardiovascular events-CV, cerebrovascular events, and 
infections) showed higher incidence of CV events in subgroups aged 65-74 and 75-84, in both the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups. Overall, the safety data of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant 
melanoma setting in patients ≥ 75 years are limited and no definitive conclusion can be drawn. 
With regard to gender subgroup analyses, the safety profile of male and female participants in 
KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054 was consistent with the established safety profile of pembrolizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 117/128 
 
 
 
monotherapy in the RSD. Based on evaluable data, there were no significant differences in the various 
AE categories by gender for pembrolizumab. In particular, the 95% CI of the risk difference between 
male and female participants in KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054 (including AE categories Grade 3 - 5 
AEs, SAEs, Grade 3 - 5 drug -related AEs, and discontinuation due to an AE or drug-related AE) 
showed no clinically significant differences in the AE profile by gender for the two studies. In 
conclusion, there are no clinically significant differences in the observed AE profile by gender for 
pembrolizumab. 
For ECOG performance status and region, the AE profile in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group 
remained generally consistent with the established safety profile of pembrolizumab. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
For the proposed indication of pembrolizumab as adjuvant treatment of paediatric (12 years and older) 
patients with Stage IIB and IIC melanoma following complete resection, safety results have been 
presented from study KEYNOTE-716, including only two adolescent patients (one enrolled in the 
pembrolizumab arm, one in the placebo group). The first patient, was diagnosed with melanoma 
approximately 3 months and 28 days prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. At screening, a KPS 
score was 100 and T4aN0M0. Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV Q3W was started on Day 1 (Cycle 1) for the 
treatment of resected high-risk Stage II melanoma and the patient received 17 cycles during the 
study. The participant entered the study with a history of acne, cystic acne, and hidradenitis, treated 
with oral clindamycin, which was stopped on Day -14. The patients experienced two episodes of 
hidradenitis (Grade 1) in the left axilla (on Day 58 and Day 124), for which no treatment was reported, 
and no further information was available. Additionally, on day 293 increased WBCs were observed, 
followed by increased lymphocyte count on day 335 (resolved on day 356). On day 356 the participant 
completed pembrolizumab; as of day 425, last contact before data cut-off, the participant was alive. 
The investigator considered the non-serious AEs of hidradenitis (2 episodes) and increased lymphocyte 
count as not related to pembrolizumab. The second patient, was diagnosed with melanoma 
approximately 4 months and 5 days prior to first dose of study medication. The patient was newly 
diagnosed with Stage IIB cutaneous melanoma confirmed by histology, which was completely 
resected, and had negative SLN biopsy prior to enrolment. At screening, a KPS score was 100 and 
T3bN0M0. No adverse events were reported. As of day 293, last contact before data cut-off, the 
participant was alive. 
The MAH provided a comparative analysis of the safety data of paediatric melanoma patients in 
KEYNOTE-051 (n=9), the cumulative safety data of KEYNOTE-051 (n=161), the pooled safety data 
from the 2 adjuvant melanoma studies (KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054) (n=992) and the pooled 
safety dataset for adults with advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006) 
(n=1567). The safety profile of pembrolizumab for paediatric participants in KEYNOTE-051 was 
generally consistent with the established safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in adults with 
advanced melanoma. The incidence of AEOSI was higher in the pooled adjuvant melanoma dataset 
(35.7%) compared to the adult advanced melanoma dataset (22.9%) and KEYNOTE-051 (18.6%), but 
the nature and severity of AEOSI were similar when compared across all the datasets, mostly mild to 
moderate in severity. They were manageable with treatment interruption, discontinuation, 
corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement therapy. Overall, the AEOSIs in the paediatric 
melanoma participants and in KEYNOTE-051 patients were comparable to that of the adult adjuvant 
and advanced melanoma participants. The most frequently reported endocrinopathy in KEYNOTE-051 
was hypothyroidism and there were no reported cases of immune-related hepatitis, nephritis, type 1 
diabetes mellitus or hypophysitis. After adjusting for duration of exposure in the datasets, the 
incidence of AEs or AEOSI in the paediatric melanoma dataset and KEYNOTE-051 remained generally 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 118/128 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with the adult advanced melanoma safety dataset and lower than in the pooled adjuvant 
melanoma safety dataset. No new safety signals were observed when the paediatric safety datasets 
were compared with the adult safety datasets. In conclusion, the safety results presented are limited 
due to the low number of included adolescent patients precluding any firm conclusions and unknown 
are the long-term toxicities associated to treatment with check point inhibitors (like autoimmune 
endocrine, hepatic and renal toxicity) in the adolescent population. However, the overall safety profile 
appears to be as expected from the known safety profile of pembrolizumab and the safety data from 
the KEYNOTE-716 and KEYNOTE-054 studies does not give raise to new safety concerns. There are, 
however, uncertainties related to the long-term safety of pembrolizumab, especially in the adjuvant 
adolescent setting, with endocrine related ADRs that may affect hormonal development in these 
patients. In order to address this issue, the MAH plans to open a new cohort in KEYNOTE-051 to collect 
long-term safety data for the treatment of adolescent melanoma in the adjuvant setting (resected 
Stage IIB, IIC and Stage III) for a total duration of 4 years including follow-up. The expected number 
of patients to be enrolled in the new cohort is difficult to predict at this point, but it is anticipated to be 
in the order of 1 patient/year for a total duration of 4 years. Considering the limited number of 
additional cases deriving from study KEYNOTE-051, a suggestion was made to explore additional 
options able to gather as more data as possible in this age category (e.g., with the collection of post-
marketing adolescent safety data facilitated through joining the existing Dutch Melanoma Treatment 
Registry (DMTR). Taking into account that DMTR has only registered 3 patients between years 2013-
2018, the MAH was recommended to continue to explore other means to gather more adolescent 
melanoma patients safety data in the post-marketing setting, but the plan to further expand the 
numerosity of clinical cases was not specifically mentioned. Relying on routine pharmacovigilance 
activities as well as exploring other means to gather more data is supported. However, in the absence 
of a clear program to collect long term safety data in the post-marketing that go beyond the limited 
timeline of the Study KN-051, the MAH was recommended to prolong the follow-up for each participant 
for as long as the KEYNOTE-051 study is open (until 2028). This request is based on the observed time 
to onset of AEOSI (median 64 days; range 1 to 371) and episode duration (median 193 days; range 1 
to 684+) from KN-716. The lack of data on the safety of pembrolizumab on the very long term in 
adolescents with Stage IIB, IIC and III melanoma treated in the adjuvant setting was reflected in 
section 4.8 Paediatric population of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There were no new safety signals observed in study KEYNOTE-716 in the pembrolizumab treatment 
arm in the adjuvant setting of completely resected Stage IIB and IIC melanoma. The ADRs observed 
were generally manageable as the severity was mainly of Grade 1-2. Drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs, 
drug-related SAEs and drug-related discontinuations occurred more often in the experimental arm than 
placebo, which is expected, and frequencies were generally comparable to what has been observed in 
KEYNOTE-054 with pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant setting and generally consistent with 
the RSD. However, an increased rate of AEOSIs mainly related to endocrine disturbances (i.e., 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) and of discontinuations due to drug-related AEs were observed 
in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group and the RSD, to which the longer 
exposure of patients in KEYNOTE-716 than in prior trials contributed. No new safety signals were 
observed when the paediatric safety datasets were compared with the adult safety datasets. However, 
the safety results presented are limited due to the low number of included adolescent patients 
precluding any firm conclusions and unknown are the long-term toxicities associated to treatment with 
check point inhibitors (like autoimmune endocrine, hepatic and renal toxicity) in the adolescent 
population. The MAH is recommended to add a new cohort to KEYNOTE-051 to collect long-term safety 
data for the treatment of adolescent melanoma in the adjuvant setting for as long as the KEYNOTE-
Assessment report

051 study is open (until 2028). The safety of adolescent melanoma patients will be also monitored 
through routine pharmacovigilance activities. Taking into account that DMTR has only registered 3 
patients between years 2013-2018, the MAH will continue to explore other means to gather more 
adolescent melanoma patients safety data in the post-marketing setting, but the plan to further 
expand the numerosity of clinical cases was not specifically mentioned. Relying on routine 
pharmacovigilance activities as well as exploring other means to gather more data is supported.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes to the package leaflet are limited; in particular, the key messages for the safe use of the 
medicinal product are not impacted. Furthermore, the design, layout and format of the package leaflet 
will not be affected by the proposed revisions. Therefore, these proposed revisions do not constitute 
significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new user consultation or a bridged focus 
testing. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Extension of indication to include the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older with Stage IIB or Stage IIC melanoma and to include adolescents aged 12 years and older in the 
adjuvant treatment of Stage III melanoma and treatment of advanced melanoma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
With particular reference to the treatment of primary melanoma Stage IIB and IIC, surgical resection 
with a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) represents the first-line approach. In the event of a negative 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 122/128 
 
 
 
 
SNB, follow-up with active surveillance for recurrence is the solely recommended action to be 
undertaken accordingly with the most recent guidelines. It is estimated that 90% of relapse occurs 
during the first 5 years post-surgery, which is therefore considered the most critical period for 
monitoring. Adjuvant systemic therapy is contemplated at relapse. It is acknowledged that the 
prognosis in terms of probability of survival in Stage IIC is similar to Stage IIIB, for which adjuvant 
therapies are currently available.  
There is therefore the need to improve the clinical management within the setting of Stage II to 
ameliorate clinical outcomes. Treatment in adolescents relies upon surgical strategies. Adjuvant 
systemic therapies are currently not licensed in Europe. There is, therefore, an unmet medical need to 
be satisfied within the paediatric setting. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The proposed adult and paediatric indication in Stage II melanoma relies upon data from Study 
KEYNOTE-716, a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, crossover/rechallenge, 
multicenter study of adjuvant pembrolizumab in participants 12 years of age and older with resected 
Stage IIB or IIC cutaneous melanoma. The study consists of Part 1 where patients were assigned to 
either pembrolizumab or placebo for a 17 cycles length of treatment, followed by Part 2 in which 
participants who completed Part 1 and experienced a recurrence were started on pembrolizumab 
regardless of the treatment received in Part 1. In the current application, only data from Part 1 are 
presented.   
In support of the paediatric indication (also including Stage III and advanced) the MAH claims 
similarity between the adult and paediatric disease in terms of biology and pharmacology of drug 
effect. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant advantage of pembrolizumab relative to placebo on RFS (HR=0.65; 95% CI: 
0.46,0.92; p=0.00658 at IA1; HR=0.6195% CI: 0.45, 0.82; p=0.00046 at IA2; IA2 represents the 
final RFS analysis prespecified according to SAP). Further support derives from the statistically 
significant effect of pembrolizumab relative to placebo on DMFS at the first interim analysis.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Confirmation is required for longer follow-up and additional clinical endpoints. The MAH will submit 
results from the planned future analyses of clinical endpoints; DMFS and OS (Annex II condition). 
Limited paediatric data are available, however the extrapolation based on the similarity between the 
adult and paediatric disease in terms of biology and pharmacology of drug effect is supported. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of drug-related AEs (79.9% vs. 60.9%), drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (16.1 % vs. 4.3%), 
drug-related SAEs (9.1% vs. 1.9%), drug discontinuations due to either drug-related AEs (15.3% vs. 
2.5%) or drug-related SAEs (6.8% vs. 2.5%) were all more frequent in the pembrolizumab group 
compared to control.

The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (incidence >10%) in KEYNOTE-716, pruritus, fatigue, 
diarrhoea, rash, hypothyroidism, and arthralgia, were consistent with the most frequently reported 
drug-related AEs in KEYNOTE-054, but higher than the RSD. In particular, the frequencies of 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in KEYNOTE-716 (14.5% and 9.9%, respectively), similar to 
those observed in KEYNOTE-054 (14.5% and 9.6%, respectively), were higher than in the RSD (9.8% 
and 3.7%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs (in ≥1.0% of participants in either treatment group) 
were hypertension, diarrhoea, rash, autoimmune hepatitis, ALT increased, colitis, and lipase increased 
but no clinically meaningful difference was observed between the pembrolizumab and placebo groups 
in the incidences of these Grade 3 to 5 AEs. 
The incidences and types of Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs in the KEYNOTE-716 pembrolizumab group 
were similar to those in KEYNOTE-054 and generally consistent with the RSD (16.1% vs. 14.5% vs. 
15.8%). The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs (incidence ≥1%) in the 
pembrolizumab group were rash (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (1.2%), colitis (1%) and diarrhoea 
(1%), slightly higher than those reported in KEYNOTE-054 and the RSD (except for colitis 1.4% in 
KEYNOTE-054). 
Colitis and adrenal insufficiency were also the main pembrolizumab-related SAEs in KEYNOTE-716 
(each reported for 4 participants 0,8%). Neither colitis nor adrenal insufficiency were observed in the 
placebo group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No data on the safety in the paediatric/adolescent adjuvant melanoma setting were available, since the 
majority of patients has already been cured by surgery. Unknown are the long-term toxicities 
associated to treatment with check point inhibitors (like autoimmune endocrine, hepatic and renal 
toxicity) in the adolescent population. The MAH was recommended to collect long-term data for each 
participant as long as the KEYNOTE-051 study is open (until 2028).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Within the setting of an adjuvant therapy, RFS can be considered a valid surrogate endpoint to infer 
treatment effects. Study KEYNOTE-716 provides evidence for a statistically significant advantage of 
pembrolizumab over placebo as adjuvant therapy in Stage II melanoma over a median follow-up of 
26.9 months. However, the submitted analysis is limited by the high degree of immaturity and 
censoring rate and insufficient length of follow-up considering that only 23.5% of events was 
registered in the control arm and the estimate of treatment mainly relies upon a comparison of cases 
occurred during the first 12 months of observation, which correspond to the on-treatment phase. 
Although immature, the initial DMFS evaluation at IA3 provided evidence of a statistically significant 
reduction of events in the pembrolizumab arm relative to placebo. In any case, the benefit of 
treatment based on RFS results in study KEYNOTE-716 requires confirmation by longer duration of 
follow-up and support by additional clinically relevant endpoints to positively conclude on the benefit of 
such an early intervention vs delayed therapies (at recurrence). The MAH has committed to submit 
final DMFS and interim OS results as part of an Annex II condition.  
Lack of characterisation of effect of treatment by PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation status is an 
important limiting factor to verify consistency across relevant patient subgroups especially in the 
context of a rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape, where the potential availability of targeted 
therapies might question the place in therapy of immunomodulation. It should be considered, however, 
that study KEYNOTE-054 showed independence of response to treatment from PD-L1 and BRAF 
hallmarks in the adjuvant setting of Stage III melanoma, and this information can be regarded as 
pertinent to the current pursued indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/574905/2022  
Page 125/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As regards the paediatric indication, efficacy data in adolescents aged >12 years are numerically 
limited to 5 of the total 9 paediatric cases of advanced melanoma recruited in study KEYNOTE-051, 
(none of them showing response to therapy), and only 1 patient in each arm in study KEYNOTE-716. 
Due to the small sample size, results are inconclusive. The MAH proposed a bridging strategy on the 
basis of biological similarity between adult and adolescent melanoma and similar pharmacology of 
pembrolizumab in the two age categories. Although disease similarity can be recognised based upon 
biological considerations and evidence of response to treatments, including immunotherapy, thus 
overcoming the unavailability of clinical data, evidence of exposure-response relationships are indirect 
and derived from the cHL disease setting. Based on the assumption that the flat exposure-response 
relationship seen in adults across multiple tumour types is preserved in paediatric patients across 
indications, the MAH concludes for a similar exposure-response profile in adult and adolescent 
melanoma. Despite the limitations of an indirect exposure-response determination, the bridging 
strategy adopted by the MAH could be deemed acceptable within the specific tumour-type, considering 
the historically recognised immunoresponsive nature of melanoma, and taking into account that 
extrapolation of pembrolizumab pharmacology from adults is limited to adolescents. However, since 
currently available clinical observations trend toward lack of response, commitment is requested to the 
MAH for prospectively collecting meaningful data in the post-marketing as regards efficacy and safety 
aspects in both the adjuvant and advanced disease treatment settings of adolescent melanoma (see 
also below). 
In terms of safety, no new signals have emerged from study KEYNOTE-716. However, it has been 
observed a higher incidence of AEOSIs than previously reported in the RSD, similarly to KEYNOTE-054. 
No new safety signals were observed when the paediatric safety datasets were compared with the 
adult safety datasets. However, the safety results presented are limited due to the low number of 
included adolescent patients precluding any firm conclusions and unknown are the long-term toxicities 
associated to treatment with check point inhibitors (like autoimmune endocrine, hepatic and renal 
toxicity) in the adolescent population. Therefore, it is considered important to collect as much post-
authorisation data as possible (on efficacy and safety outcomes) on paediatric/adolescent treated 
patients in the approved indication(s). The MAH was recommended to open a new cohort in Study 
KEYNOTE-051 to recruit paediatric patients in the adjuvant melanoma setting. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based upon a statistically significant effect on RFS and considering the supportive data derived from 
study KEYNOTE-054, benefit of treatment can be considered sufficiently demonstrated. Further support 
derives from the statistically significant effect of pembrolizumab relative to placebo on DMFS at the 
first interim analysis. Taking in to account the acceptable safety profile, it can be concluded that the 
benefit/risk is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The paediatric indication can be considered adequately supported by the proposed bridging strategy. 
For the adjuvant setting, only 2 paediatric patients were included in the pivotal study KEYNOTE-716, 
while data available in the paediatric advanced disease stage as derived from study KEYNOTE-051 
were scarce. Conclusions are supported by the extrapolation of the benefit/risk profile from adults. 
However, uncertainties remain on the long-term safety of pembrolizumab in adolescents, especially in 
the adjuvant adolescent setting, with endocrine related ADRs that may affect hormonal development in 
these patients. A recommendation has been made to address this issue in the post-marketing (PAM-
REC). A new cohort to KEYNOTE-051 to collect long-term safety data for the treatment of adolescent

melanoma in the adjuvant setting as long as the KEYNOTE-051 study is open (until 2028) will be 
added and the safety of adolescent melanoma patients will be also monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. Taking into account that DMTR has only registered 3 patients between 
years 2013-2018, the MAH will continue to explore other means to gather more adolescent melanoma 
patient safety data in the post-marketing setting, but the plan to further expand the numerosity of 
clinical cases has not been specifically mentioned. Relying on routine pharmacovigilance activities as 
well as exploring other means to gather more data is supported. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda as adjuvant therapy in adult and paediatric Stage II melanoma is positive. 
The paediatric indication of Keytruda as adjuvant in Stage III and treatment in advanced disease in the 
paediatric setting can be considered approvable. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of 
pembrolizumab as adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with Stage 
IIB or IIC melanoma, the MAH should submit the per-protocol specified final analysis of DMFS and 
interim analysis of OS for study KN716: A Phase III Clinical Trial of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in 
Subjects with complete resection of high-risk Stage II melanoma

affected 
I, II and IIIB 
Extension of indication to include the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older with Stage IIB, Stage IIC or stage III melanoma and to inlcude the treatment of adolescents 
aged 12 years and older with advanced melanoma for Keytruda; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 37 of the 
RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to introduce editorial improvements in the wording of the indication for MSI-H or dMMR 
cancers in section 4.1 of the SmPC and update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended.

Summary of Risk Management Plan for Tegsedi (inotersen) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TEGSEDI. The RMP details important 
risks  of  TEGSEDI,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be 
obtained about TEGSEDI 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
TEGSEDI 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how TEGSEDI should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for TEGSEDI should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
TEGSEDI's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
TEGSEDI  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  hereditary  transthyretin 
amyloidosis with symptoms of polyneuropathy, Stage 1 or Stage 2 (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  It  contains  inotersen  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by  subcutaneous 
(SC) injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of TEGSEDI’s benefits can be found in TEGSEDI’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tegsedi. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of TEGSEDI, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about TEGSEDI's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of TEGSEDI, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. In addition to these measures, 
information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and  regularly  analysed, 
including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These 
measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use  of TEGSEDI is  not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
   
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of TEGSEDI are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks  can be  regarded as identified  or potential. Identified  risks are  concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of TEGSEDI. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long- term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important Identified Risk – Thrombocytopenia including a serious bleeding episode 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Decrease in platelet counts was observed in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in monkeys. Severe reductions in platelet count (i.e., 
<25×109/L), in the 39-week study, were sporadic and occurred 
between 11 to 13 weeks for two monkeys. 
Clinical Studies CS2 and CS3. 
CS2 was a randomised controlled trial. 
Reduction in platelet count was observed within CS2 and 
thrombocytopenia, including a serious bleeding episode was 
therefore identified as an important identified risk of treatment 
with TEGSEDI.

Important Potential Risk - Ocular Toxicity due to vitamin A Deficiency 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
One of the main functions of TTR is to bind to the RBP4-retinol 
complex and thereby prevent renal clearance of this complex. 
Therefore, reductions of plasma TTR levels are predicted to cause a 
subsequent decrease in plasma RBP4 levels. As expected, 
treatment with TEGSEDI in monkeys caused a time-dependent 
reduction in circulating RBP4 levels similar to the kinetics observed 
for TTR levels. There was about 60% reduction in plasma RBP4 
levels in several independent monkey studies, but no sign of retinal 
toxicity through 9 months of treatment at doses up to 20 
mg/kg/wk.

CS2 was a randomised controlled trial.

Study TEG4002 
Study short name and title: 
TEG4002  -  A  Retrospective,  Non-interventional,  Multi-centre  Study  of  TEGSEDI-treated 
Patients to Evaluate Real-world Adherence to, and Effectiveness of, the Recommendations for 
Platelet  Monitoring,  Dose  Adjustment,  and  Steroid  Initiation  to  Manage  Risk  of 
Thrombocytopenia  
Purpose of the study:  
One of the important identified risks for TEGSEDI is thrombocytopenia, including a serious 
bleeding episode. In the post-authorisation setting, to mitigate the risk of thrombocytopenia 
through early detection, the SmPC recommends platelet monitoring every two weeks if the 
platelet count is greater than 100 x 109/L, and every week if the platelet count is 75 x 109/L 
to <100 x 109/L. The recommended frequency of platelet monitoring increases as the 
platelet count falls, to daily counts when the count is <25 x 109/L, with recommendations 
for dosing adjustment and, if applicable, treatment with steroids. Additionally, a patient 
alert card has been included as an additional risk minimisation measure in the post-
authorisation setting. Top-line messages included in the patient alert card identify that the 
patient has been treated with TEGSEDI, which may result in thrombocytopenia including risk 
of a serious bleeding episode and includes information to help patients recognise warning 
signs and symptoms of low platelet count and serious bleeding. 
The primary objective of the study is: 
•  To  evaluate  real-world  adherence  to,  and  effectiveness  of,  the  recommended 
schedule  for  platelet  monitoring,  dose  adjustment,  and  initiation  of  steroids  for 
platelet recovery. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
•  To evaluate real-world thrombocytopenia-related outcomes (e.g., incidence rates of 
thrombocytopenia and serious bleeding events associated with thrombocytopenia) 
in  patients  who  receive  TEGSEDI  based  on 
level(s)  of  adherence  with 
recommendations  for  platelet  monitoring  and  TEGSEDI  dose  adjustment  per  the 
SmPC  
•  To  evaluate  potential  predictors  of  adherence  with  recommendations  for  platelet 
monitoring,  TEGSEDI  dose  adjustment,  and  initiation  of  steroids  for  platelet 
recovery per the SmPC in patients who receive TEGSEDI 
Study TEG4005 
Study short name and title: 
 
 
 
 
 
TEG4005:  Pregnancy  Surveillance  Program  of  Women  and  Infants  Exposed  to  TEGSEDI 
During Pregnancy 
Purpose of the study: 
Due to the lack of data reported on TEGSEDI exposure in human pregnancy, the background 
risk  of  major  congenital  malformations  and  miscarriage  for  the  indicated  population  is 
unknown.  As  such,  there  are  no  data  to  assess  drug-associated  risks  of  birth  defects, 
miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In order to better describe the safety 
profile  of  TEGSEDI  when  used  during  pregnancy,  Akcea  is  conducting  a  pregnancy 
surveillance programme to collect and evaluate the effect of TEGSEDI on maternal pregnancy 
complications and outcomes, and on the health of infants exposed during pregnancy. The 
lack of data on human pregnancy exposures to TEGSEDI makes such a study an essential 
component of the ongoing programme of pharmacoepidemiological studies on the safety of 
this product. 
The objectives of this pregnancy surveillance programme are to: 
•  Estimate the frequency of selected pregnancy and fetal/neonatal outcomes through 
1 year of age in women who were exposed to at least 1 dose of TEGSEDI (Cohort 1) 
within 25 weeks prior to conception or during pregnancy, with the exposure window 
of interest for  major congenital malformations  being the  first trimester, and in the 
unexposed cohort of pregnant women (Cohort 2) who have a diagnosis of hereditary 
transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN)  
o  pregnancy  outcomes  include  live  births,  spontaneous  abortions,  stillbirths, 
elective abortions, preterm birth  
o  fetal/neonatal  outcomes  include  major  and  minor  congenital  malformations, 
small for gestational age, failure to thrive, and postnatal development 
•  Estimate  the  frequency  of  selected  pregnancy  complications  in  women  who  were 
exposed  to  TEGSEDI  (Cohort  1)  within  25  weeks  prior  to  conception  or  during 
pregnancy and in the unexposed cohort of pregnant women (Cohort 2) who have a 
diagnosis of hATTR-PN.

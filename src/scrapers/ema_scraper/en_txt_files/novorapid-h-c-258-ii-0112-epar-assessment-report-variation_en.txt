2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
T1DM is among the most common chronic diseases in children and adolescents, and accounts for between 
70−90% of all diabetic cases in the paediatric population. T1DM is characterised by autoimmune destruction 
of the pancreatic beta-cells resulting in absolute insulin deficiency. Subjects with T1DM need complete 
exogenous insulin replacement to cover basal as well as meal-related (bolus) insulin requirements. 
A recent publication in JAMA estimated the prevalence of T1DM in children aged 0 to ≤4 years, in the US in 
2009, to be 0.29 cases per 1000 subjects (241 cases in 832.791 subjects). This shows that even if the 
prevalence of T1DM is low in the very young children compared to older age groups, the disease does exist 
in this age group, and there is a need for treatment in children down to 1 year. 
A number of landmark studies have demonstrated the importance of maintaining tight glycaemic control to 
reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with diabetes. The DCCT study confirmed that 
intensified long-term glucose control reduces both the incidence and the progression of complications 
occurring in relation to T1DM in adults and adolescents ≥13 years of age. 
NovoRapid is a rapid acting insulin analogue with a profile that resembles the physiological action profile of 
endogenous insulin. NovoRapid has been on the market worldwide for more than a decade for the treatment 
of diabetes mellitus, and has a well-established efficacy and safety profile based on extensive clinical 
experience and clinical trial data. It is approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents 
and children aged 2 years and above. 
The efficacy and safety of NovoRapid in paediatric subjects have been further studied in two recently 
completed long-term therapeutic confirmatory trials (NN1250-3561 and NN5401-3816, referred to as trial 
3561 and trial 3816). Both trials were conducted in children and adolescents aged 1 to less than 18 years 
and provide information about the use of NovoRapid in this population including children down to 1 year of 
age.

The use of Tresiba and Levemir in children and adolescents from the age of 1 year was approved for 
treatment of diabetes mellitus in the EU in January 2015 (EMEA/H/C/2498/II/11) and July 2015 
(EMEA/H/C/0528/II/70), respectively. These approvals were based on data from trial 3561. 
The use of Ryzodeg in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents from the age of 2 year 
was approved in the EU in July 2016 (EMEA/H/C/2499/II/17) based on the results from trial 3816. 
In both trials, randomisation was stratified by age groups (1−5 years; 6−11 years and 12−17 years) 
according to European regulatory authority; the results for the age group 1−5 years are used to support the 
extension of use down to 1 year of age.

2.4.1.  Main studies 
 Two long-term therapeutic confirmatory phase 3b trials (NN1250-3561 and NN5401-3816, referred to as 
trial 3561 and trial 3816) have been conducted which included paediatric subjects treated with NovoRapid. 
The primary objective of the two studies was to investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec (IDeg) 
and insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDeg/Asp), respectively. In both studies the comparator was insulin 
detemir (IDet).

Trial ID NN1250-3561: A trial investigating the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec (IDeg) plus meal 
time insulin aspart (IAsp) versus insulin detemir (IDet) once or twice daily plus meal time insulin aspart 
(IAsp) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
Trial ID NN5401-3816: A trial investigating the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart 
(IDeg/Asp) once daily plus insulin aspart (IAsp)for the remaining meals versus insulin detemir (IDet) once 
or twice daily plus meal time insulin aspart (IAsp) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Both trials were conducted in children and adolescents aged 1 to less than 18 years and provide information 
about the use of NovoRapid in this population including children down to 1 year of age. In both trials, 
randomisation was stratified by age groups (1−5 years; 6−11 years and 12−17 years); the results for the 
age group 1−5 years are used to support the extension of use down to 1 year of age. 
Methods 
Trial 3561 
This was a 26-week, open labelled, randomised (1:1), multinational, multi-centre, two arm parallel group, 
treat to target (TTT), safety and efficacy trial comparing insulin degludec with insulin detemir as basal insulin 
in combination with insulin aspart as bolus insulin in type 1 diabetes subjects between 1 and less than 18 
years of age, followed by a 26-week extension investigating long term safety and immunogenicity. 
The trial design was agreed in collaboration with PDCO as an integrated part of the PIP for IDeg and was 
further to provide some supporting efficacy and safety data for the age group 1-2 years, in accordance with 
the PIP for IDet. 
Figure 1 Study design 3561 
Following screening, eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 manner into one of the treatment groups. 
Randomisation was stratified according to age group (1 to less than 6 years, 6 to less than 12 years and 12 
to less than 18 years of age). During the trial treatment period, all subjects were titrated according to the 
Insulin Titration Guideline. For subjects who only completed the main period (26 weeks of treatment) the 
duration was approximately 29 weeks. The trial included a screening visit (Visit 1), a randomisation visit 
(Visit 2), followed by 8 site visits (including one follow-up visit), and 18 phone contacts. 
Trial 3816 
This was a 16-week multi-national, multi-centre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, randomised, 
treat-to-target (T-T-T), efficacy and safety trial comparing treatment with IDegAsp OD, with a main meal +

IAsp for the remaining meals vs. IDet + meal-time IAsp in children and adolescents with T1DM between 1 
and less than 18 years of age. 
The trial design was agreed upon with PDCO as a binding element of the PIP for IDegAsp. 
Figure 2 Study design 3816 
Following screening, the subjects were randomised 1:1 to the treatment groups and stratified by the age 
groups: 1 year to < 6 years; 6 years to <12 years; and 12 years <18 years. During the trial treatment 
period, all subjects were titrated according to the Insulin Titration Guideline Protocol. The total trial duration 
for the individual subjects was approximately 18 weeks. The trial included a screening visit (Visit 1) followed 
by a 16-week randomised treatment period and a follow-up visit (Visit 19) 7−12 days after the actual date 
of the last treatment visit (Visit 18). 
Study participants 
In both trials, eligible subjects were aged 1 to less than 18 years with T1DM, treated for at least 3 months 
on any insulin regimen (no oral antidiabetic drugs allowed), with a total daily insulin dose ≤2 units/kg and 
with an HbA1c value at screening ≤11%. Subjects with known hypoglycaemic unawareness or recurrent 
episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, as well as subjects with more than 1 event of diabetic ketoacidosis 
requiring hospitalisation within the last 3 months prior to the screening visit, were excluded from 
participation in the trials. 
Treatments 
At randomisation, subjects were to switch to either IDeg or IDet (trial 3561) or IDegAsp or IDet (trial 3816) 
from their previous insulin treatment in accordance with the titration guideline included as part of the 
protocol for trial 3561 and trial 3816. 
In both trials, IAsp was administered as bolus insulin in both treatment groups. 
A treat-to-target approach with weekly contacts (visits or phone contacts) was implemented in order to 
ensure optimal glycaemic control for each individual subject. The titration algorithms for basal and bolus 
insulin specified the plasma glucose target and the recommended insulin dose adjustments at different 
plasma glucose levels. All subjects were to be individually titrated on a continuous basis according to a 
pre-specified plasma glucose target range adopted from the ISPAD 2009 guidelines. The fasting, pre-meal 
and bedtime plasma glucose target was 5.0−8.0 mmol/L. 
All adjustments of insulin doses were made at the discretion of the investigator.

Titration of insulin aspart 
In both trial 3561 and trial 3816, IAsp was titration either by use of a sliding scale (Table 2) or according 
to the principles of flexible dosing (carbohydrate counting).

Objectives 
Trial 3516  
The primary objective was to confirm the efficacy of insulin degludec administered once daily plus mealtime 
insulin aspart in controlling glycaemia with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of 
treatment by comparing the difference in change in HbA1c between insulin degludec + insulin aspart and 
insulin detemir + insulin aspart to a non-inferiority limit of 0.4%, and if non-inferiority is confirmed, to a 
superiority limit of 0%.  
Secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety between the two treatment arms in terms of 
parameters of glycaemic control and safety.  
Trial 3816 
The primary objective was to confirm the efficacy of IDegAsp administered once daily plus meal-time IAsp 
for the remaining meals in controlling glycaemia with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 
weeks of treatment. This is done by comparing the difference in change from baseline in HbA1c between 
IDegAsp + meal-time IAsp for the remaining meals and IDet + meal-time IAsp to a non-inferiority limit of 
0.4%, and if non-inferiority is confirmed, to a superiority limit of 0%. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety between the two treatment groups.

•  Change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 16 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Change from baseline in FPG after 16 weeks of treatment 
•  SMPG measurements (4-point profiles) obtained throughout the trial for dose adjustments 
o Mean PG before meals and before bedtime after 16 weeks of treatment

o Mean of the 8-point profiles after 16 weeks of treatment 
o Fluctuation in the 8-point profiles after 16 weeks of treatment 
o Prandial PG increment from 8-point profiles after 16 weeks of treatment 
Sample size 
In both studies the sample size was based on the primary endpoint using the similar assumptions; a 
one-sided significance level of 0.025, a mean treatment difference of 0 and a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% 
(in accordance with FDA guidance and for study 3816, also in agreement with PDCO as an integrated part 
of the PIP for IDegAsp.). Based on experience from previous phase 3 trials in children and adolescents with 
T1DM treated with insulin a conservative estimate for the SD of 1.25% for HbA1c was used in the sample 
size calculation. The minimum sample size required to meet the primary objective with at least 80% power 
was 310 subjects. 
Taking into account the estimated number of subjects excluded in the PP analysis set the total number of 
randomised subjects in each study was to be at least 346. 
Randomisation 
At the randomisation visit (Visit 2) eligible subjects (complying with all exclusion/inclusion criteria) were 
randomised 1:1using IV/WRS to either IDeg 100 U/mL or IDet 100 U/mL, both in combination with IAsp 
(trial 3561) and to either IDegAsp or IDet, both in combination with meal-time IAsp (trial 3816).  
In both studies randomisation was stratified according to 3 age groups: 1 to less than 6 years; 6 to less than 
12 years; 12 to less than 18 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 11/45 
 
  
  
 
For study 3561 to be in line with the approved PIP, the age-group distribution should be at least 80 children 
aged 1-5 years (both inclusive) and 250-260 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years (both inclusive). At 
least 30% and not more than 70% should be girls. 
For study 3816 to be in accordance with the approved PIP, at least 60 randomised subjects had to be 
younger than 6 years at inclusion. Additionally at least 30% and not more than 70% were to be girls. 
Blinding (masking) 
The treatment in both studies was open-labelled due to the complexities involved with double blinded 
studies when using pen systems (3561) and since the treatment regimens required different number of 
daily injections (3816). 
The internal Novo Nordisk safety committee and the external data monitoring committee (DMC) reviewed 
safety data on an ongoing basis. The internal safety committee was blinded and the DMC was unblinded. 
External classification of severe hypoglycaemia was performed blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 26 weeks of treatment (3561) or 16 
weeks of treatment (3816), respectively. Non-inferiority was considered confirmed if the upper bound of the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval was below or equal to 0.4%. Analyses of all endpoints were to be based 
on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) including all randomised subjects with the primary efficacy analysis to be 
repeated on the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set. 
The PP analysis set in the two studies was similarly defined. In study 3561 the PP included subjects without 
any major protocol violations that may have affected the primary endpoint, subjects were to have been 
exposed for more than 12 weeks and to have a valid assessment necessary for deriving the primary 
endpoint. In study 3816, the PP set consisted of all subjects in the FAS who complied with all 
exclusion/inclusion criteria, had a non-missing HbA1c at screening or randomisation, had at least one 
non-missing HbA1c after 12 weeks of exposure and had at least 12 weeks of exposure. 
In study 3561 the primary analysis was performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with 
treatment, sex, region and age group as fixed factors and baseline HbA1c as covariate. Region was a factor 
with four levels (Europe (including Russia), United States (US), Japan and South Africa). 
In study 3816 the primary analysis was initially to be based on an ANOVA but was changed to a MMRM 
model with Amendment no.1 (25 Feb 2014, upon request from FDA).  All observed HbA1c measurements 
available post-randomisation at scheduled measurement times was analysed with a mixed model for 
repeated measurements (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance matrix. The model included treatment, 
sex, region, age-group and visit as factors and baseline HbA1c as covariate. Interactions between visit and 
all factors and covariates were also included in the model. Region was a factor with three levels (EU 
(including Russian Federation and Israel), North America and Other). 
In study 3561 an analysis using MMRM and in study 3816 an analysis based on an ANOVA was performed 
as sensitivity analyses.  
Statistical methods for the analyses of secondary endpoints were pre-defined and mainly in accordance with 
the primary analysis method used in the primary analysis in each of the study (ANOVA 3561, MMRM 3816). 
For study 3561 it was stated that selected tables and figures were to be presented also by age group to get 
a description of key endpoints and parameters per age group.  
In study 3816 it was stated that relevant endpoints (as a minimum demographics, Hba1c, FPG, SMPG, 
hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and body weight) should also be presented descriptively by the 3 age 
groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 12/45 
 
  
  
In both studies, the Safety analysis set included all subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication. 
Safety data were mainly to be summarised descriptively. In both studies the number of treatment emergent 
hypoglycaemic episodes was to be analysed separately using a negative binomial regression model with a 
log-link function and the logarithm of the time period for which a hypoglycaemic episode is considered 
treatment emergent as offset. The model was to include treatment, sex, region and age group as fixed 
factors. In study 3816 it was further stated that the number of treatment emergent hyperglycaemic 
episodes and the number of treatment emergent hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis were to be analysed 
separately using the same approach as above.  
No interim analyses were performed during any of the studies. 
A few (minor) changes were made in the SAP compared to the content in the study protocol for study 3561 
and 3816 respectively. In study 3561 two additional/exploratory analyses were added post-hoc and in 
study 3816 one additional/exploratory analysis was added post-hoc.

Study 3561 
Table 3 Subject disposition – summary – trial 3561 
A total of 363 subjects were screened and a total of 350 subjects were randomised to IDeg or IDet 
treatment. Of the subjects who were screening failures, 5 failed to meet inclusion criteria 6 (HbA1c ≤11%), 
2 subjects failed inclusion criteria 7 (ability to perform 4 and 8 point profiles), 1 subject did not fulfil inclusion 
criteria 4 (minimum 3 months insulin use) and 5 subjects withdrew consent. Of the randomised subjects, 1 
subject in IDet arm was withdrawn before being exposed to trial product, as the subject was newly 
diagnosed and therefore did not fulfil inclusion criteria 4.  
A total of 335 (95.7%) subjects completed the trial. Of the 15 subjects who withdrew during the trial, 2

subjects (both IDet) withdrew due to adverse events. The most common reason for withdrawal (4 subjects 
in each arm) was fulfilment of withdrawal criteria 1 (subject withdrew consent). 
For subject disposition for the age group 1-5 years old, see below under “Numbers analysed”. 
Study 3816 
Table 4 Subject disposition – summary – trial 3816 
A total of 387 subjects were screened, of which 25 were screening failures and a total of 362 subjects were 
randomised to IDegAsp or IDet treatment. Of the subjects who were screening failures, 17 subjects did not 
meet inclusion criterion 6 (HbA1c ≤11%), 1 subject met exclusion criterion 2 (use of oral antidiabetic 
agents), 1 subject met exclusion criterion 9 (mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers, 
precluding adequate understanding or cooperation) and 6 subjects withdrew consent. Of the randomised 
subjects, 1 subject in the IDegAsp group was withdrawn before being exposed due to having withdrawn 
consent and 1 subject in the IDet group was withdrawn before being exposed due to having been 
randomised in error due to that the subject was randomised before receiving the results of Visit 1. 
A total of 342 subjects (94.5%) completed the trial with a similar proportion of subjects completing 
in both treatment groups. Of the 20 subjects who withdrew during the trial, 1 subject in the IDegAsp group 
withdrew due to an adverse event. The most common reason for withdrawal was fulfilment of withdrawal 
criterion 1 (withdrew consent). 1 subject in the IDegAsp treatment group withdrew due to non-compliance 
with the protocol and 2 subjects in the IDet treatment group withdrew due to other reasons. 
For subject disposition for the age group 1-5 years old, see below under “Numbers analysed”.

Conduct of the study 
Study 3561 was initiated 16 January 2012 and was completed 08 February 2013. The data cut-off date was 
13 March 2013. There were 6 substantial amendments to the protocol with amendments 1 and 2 
implemented prior to trial initiation. Substantial amendment 3 (06 Mar 2012) was a global amendment to 
clarify the endpoints to be measured in the extension period. An additional secondary endpoint, 
measurement of insulin antibodies (IDeg specific, IDet specific, IAsp specific and antibodies cross-reacting 
to human insulin) after 26 weeks and 52 weeks of treatment was added. Amendment 4, 6 and 8 were 
non-global.  
Study 3816 was initiated 17 October 2013 and was completed 07 November 2014. The data cut-off date 
(and database lock) was 26 November 2014. There were 2 global amendments to the protocol (both 
concerned changes within the Statistical Analysis Plan). 
Baseline data 
Study 3561 
Demographic characteristics - all subjects 
The trial population consisted of children and adolescents with T1DM aged between 1 to less than 18 years 
at randomisation. Males comprised 55.4% of the trial population. Approximately 29% of the subjects were 
from the US, 16% were from Japan and 52% were from Europe including the Russian Federation. The 
majority of subjects (75%) were ‘White’ and the second most common race was ‘Asian non-Indian’ (16%). 
Almost all subjects (97.1%) were ‘not Hispanic or Latino’. 
There were only minor differences between the treatment groups with regards to demographics and baseline 
characteristics. 
Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics were similar for the full analysis set and the 
extension trial set. 
Age group demographics based on the extension trial set were similar to those based on the full analysis set. 
Demographic characteristics - age groups 
Overall, the baseline demographics for the three age groups in the IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp treatment 
groups were in line with that of all subjects, except for the male/female ratio in children aged 1−5 years in 
the IDet+IAsp group, where more females than males were included. 
Four (4) subjects aged 1 year were included; 2 to IDeg+IAsp (the youngest being 1.5 years) and 2 to 
IDet+IAsp (the youngest being 1.8 years).

Table 5 Descriptive statistics - age - children (1-5 years) - full analysis set 
Age group demographics based on the extension trial set were similar to those based on the full analysis set.  
Diabetes characteristics - all subjects 
At baseline, the mean baseline HbA1c was slightly higher in the IDeg+IAsp group (8.2%) as compared to the 
IDet+IAsp group (8.0%). The mean baseline FPG was higher in the IDeg+IAsp group (9.0 mmol/L [162.1 
mg/dL]) than in the IDet+IAsp group (8.4 mmol/L [151.0 mg/dL]). Other baseline characteristics were 
similar in the two treatment groups. The baseline diabetes characteristics were similar based on the full 
analysis set and the extension trial set. 
Diabetes characteristics - age groups 
As would be expected, the mean baseline height, weight, BMI and duration of diabetes were lowest in 
children 1−5 years and highest in adolescents 12−17 years in both treatment groups. Only minor variations 
were observed in the diabetes characteristics across the age groups in the two treatment groups. In the 
IDeg+IAsp treatment group, the mean HbA1c was slightly higher in adolescents 12−17 years compared to 
the two younger age groups, whereas the mean FPG was lower. In the IDet+IAsp treatment group, the 
mean HbA1c was similar across the three age groups, while the mean FPG was lower in children aged 1−5 
years than in the two other age groups. The diabetes characteristics based on the extension trial set were 
overall in line with those based on the full analysis set for both treatment groups, although mean HbA1c 
(7.8−8.2%) and FPG (7.7–9.6 mmol/L [137.9−172.4 mg/dL]) varied slightly more across the age groups. 
Diabetes complications 
A total of 4 subjects reported diabetes complications at screening (IDeg+IAsp: 1 subject with diabetic 
ketoacidosis; IDet+IAsp: 3 subjects with diabetic neuropathy).  
Anti-diabetic regimen at screening 
At screening, the vast majority of subjects (335; 95.7% of randomised subjects) were using basal/bolus 
therapy, of which 5 (1.4%) were using basal/bolus + premix. The remaining 15 (4.3%) were using “other” 
regimens (i.e., basal, bolus, premix alone or premix in combination with basal or bolus); “other” could also 
include a pump regimen. 
In both treatment groups, IDet and IGlar were the most widely used basal insulin products at screening and 
IAsp was the most commonly used bolus insulin. IDet was used by 85 (48.8%) subjects randomised to 
IDeg+IAsp and 83 (47.2%) subjects randomised to IDet+IAsp. It was not recorded whether IDet was used 
OD or BID at trial entry. IGlar was used by 71 (40.8%) subjects in the IDeg+IAsp group and by 76 (43.2%) 
subjects in the IDet+IAsp group. IAsp was used by 115 (66.1%) subjects in the IDeg+IAsp group and by 
123 (69.9%) subjects in the IDet+IAsp group. IDet and IGlar were also the most widely used basal insulin 
products at screening based on the extension trial set.

extension trial period 
Assessment report

Overall, the subjects (IDeg+IAsp: 18 [10.3%] subjects and IDet+IAsp: 37 [21.0%] subjects), who 
completed the main trial period without continuing in the extension trial period, were distributed evenly 
across the three age groups with both treatments (IDeg+IAsp: 9.8%−11.6%; IDet+IAsp: 19.7%−22.1%). 
The majority of subjects not continuing in the extension trial period came from the US, South Africa (these 
12 subjects could not continue for administrative reasons, Japan, Finland and France. Compared to the 
subjects continuing in the extension period (mean age: 10.1 years, and mean duration of diabetes: 4.0−4.1 
years), they were slightly younger (mean age: 9.0 and 9.5 years with IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp, 
respectively) with a shorter duration of diabetes (mean duration: 3.3 and 3.9 years with IDeg+IAsp and 
IDet+IAsp, respectively). 
The most commonly used basal insulin at screening in the subjects not continuing in the extension trial 
period was IDet, which was used by 8 (44.4%) subjects randomised to IDeg+IAsp and 21 (56.8%) subjects 
randomised to IDet+IAsp. The most commonly used bolus insulin was IAsp (used by 10 [55.6%] and 30 
[81.1%] subjects randomised to IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp, respectively). 
Study 3816 
Baseline and demographic characteristics - all subjects 
The trial population consisted of children and adolescents with T1DM aged 1 to less than 18 years at 
randomisation. Females comprised 51.7% of the trial population. The trial was multinational with 60.2% of 
subjects from sites in Europe (including Israel and Russia), 34.5% from North America, 3.3% from South 
Africa and 1.9% from South America. The majority of subjects were ‘White’ (93.1%) and not Hispanic or 
Latino (92.3%). There were no major differences between the treatment groups with regards to 
demographics and baseline characteristics. 
Baseline and demographic characteristics - age groups 
Within each age group, the demographics and baseline characteristics were well matched between the 
treatment groups. 
One (1) child included in the trial was 1 year old; this child was randomised to the IDet+IAsp group and was 
1.9 years old. The youngest child in the IDegAsp+IAsp group was 2.2 years old. 
Table 6 Descriptive statistics – age - children (1-5 years) - full analysis set 
Baseline diabetes characteristics – all subjects 
The baseline diabetes characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups apart from slight 
differences in mean FPG and mean duration of diabetes. For the overall trial population, the mean FPG at 
baseline was slightly higher in the IDegAsp+IAsp group than in the IDet+IAsp group: 8.6 mmol/L (155.6 
mg/dL) versus 8.1 mmol/L (146.5 mg/dL), respectively. The mean duration of diabetes was also slightly 
higher in the IDegAsp+IAsp group than in the IDet+IAsp group: 4.4 years versus 3.8 years, respectively.

Baseline diabetes characteristics – age groups 
In children 1−5 years and 6−11 years, the baseline and diabetic characteristics were comparable in the 
treatment groups. 
In adolescents 12−17 years, mean FPG was slightly higher in the IDegAsp+IAsp group: 9.0 mmol/L (162.4 
mg/dL) compared to the IDet+IAsp group: 8.1 mmol/L (146.1 mg/dL). Otherwise the treatment groups 
were comparable. 
Diabetic complications 
Fewer diabetic complications were reported in the IDegAsp+IAsp group (reported by 5 subjects) than in the 
IDet+IAsp group (reported by 9 subjects). 
Antidiabetic regimen at screening 
Antidiabetic regimens at screening were overall similar in the treatment groups. At screening, the majority 
of subjects (333 subjects [92.0%]) were using basal-bolus insulin therapy, 5 (1.4%) were using basal-bolus 
+ premix while 24 (6.6%) were using ‘other’ regimens (i.e., basal, bolus, premix alone or premix in 
combination with bolus); ‘other’ could also include an insulin pump regimen. 
IDet was the most widely used basal insulin at screening followed by IGlar. IAsp was the most commonly 
used bolus insulin. 
Approximately half the subjects had used IDet at screening/before randomisation: 75 (41.2%) in the 
IDegAsp+IAsp group and 95 (52.8%) in the IDet+IAsp group. IGlar was used by 77 (42.3%) and 70 
(38.9%) of subjects, respectively. IAsp was used by 107 (58.7%) subjects in the IDegAsp+IAsp group and 
by 113 (62.8%) subjects in the IDet+IAsp group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Results are presented for all subjects first, in line with the objectives of the trials, followed by results for the 
age groups. Comparisons between treatment groups as well as comparisons between the age groups 1−5 
years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years are described where the focus is on the age group 1−5 years. Notice 
that none of the trials were powered to compare endpoints between treatments within the three age groups. 
Therefore, no statistical analyses were performed between age groups and any trend within a given age 
group should be interpreted with caution considering the limited number of subjects within each age group. 
•  Primary endpoint 
Study 3561 
Overall, IDeg effectively improved glycaemic control as measured by change in HbA1c and non-inferiority to 
IDet in terms of lowering HbA1c was confirmed, as the upper limit of the 95% CI for the estimated mean 
treatment difference was ≤ 0.4 %.

Table 9 HbA1c (%) after 26 weeks of treatment - primary statistical analysis – FAS – trial 3561 
The PP analysis showed an estimated treatment difference in line with the main analysis, treatment 
difference IDeg OD- IDet 0.19 [95% CI; 0.01; 0.37]. The conclusion of the PP analysis is that it supports the 
primary analysis (non-inferiority) since the upper limit of the CI is below 0.4%.  
HbA1c after 52 weeks - all subjects 
After 52 weeks of treatment, the observed reduction in HbA1c was maintained in both treatment groups. The 
change from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment was similar with IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp with 
an estimated treatment difference (IDeg+IAsp – IDet+IAsp) of -0.01%-points [-0.20; 0.19]95%CI). This 
result was supported by the sensitivity analyses. 
The observed mean HbA1c was 7.9% and 7.8% after 52 weeks of treatment with IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp, 
respectively (Table 10). The observed mean change from baseline was -0.27%-points with IDeg+IAsp and 
-0.22%-points with IDet+IAsp. 
The change over time in HbA1c during the trial was similar with both treatments. 
HbA1c after 52 weeks - age groups 
For children 1-5 years treated with IDeg a gradual decline in HbA1c over time was observed and with IDet 
mean HbA1c declined from baseline to week 12.

Study 3816 
The primary objective of this trial was to confirm the efficacy of IDegAsp administered OD + meal-time IAsp 
for the remaining meals in controlling glycaemia with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 
weeks of treatment. IDegAsp OD + IAsp maintained glycaemic control as measured by change in HbA1c and 
non-inferiority to IDet + IAsp in terms of changing HbA1c was confirmed, as the upper limit of the 95% CI 
for the mean treatment difference was ≤ 0.4%.

All sensitivity analysis showed an estimated mean treatment difference in line with the main analysis and 
supported the conclusion of non-inferiority, as the upper limit of the 95% CI ≤ 0.4% and the estimated mean 
treatment differences were close to that for the primary analysis (–0.04%-points).

•  Secondary endpoints 
Fasting plasma glucose 
In trial 3561, there was an overall observed reduction in mean FPG in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group, and 
an overall observed increase in the IDet+IAsp treatment group during the trial. Due to the sustained 
reduction in FPG in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group, the difference between the two treatments was more 
pronounced, and statistically significant at 52 weeks of treatment. 
With IDeg+IAsp, a reduction in mean FPG was observed from baseline to 52 weeks in all three age groups; 
the reduction was most pronounced in children aged 1−5 years and 6−11 years. With IDet+IAsp, the mean 
FPG increased from baseline to 52 weeks in all three age groups where the increase was most pronounced 
in children aged 1−5 years. 
In trial 3816, the overall observed changes in mean FPG were minor in both treatment groups; a small 
reduction was seen in IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group and a minor increase was seen in the IDet+IAsp 
treatment group during the trial. No statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups. 
No pattern in changes in mean FPG was observed from baseline to 16 weeks in the age groups. In the 
IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group, a reduction was observed in the age groups 1−5 years and 12−17 years 
whereas in the IDet+IAsp treatment group, a reduction was observed in the age group 6−11 years. An 
increase in FPG was observed for the other age groups. 
Self-measured plasma glucose profile 
Trial 3561 
8-point SMPG profiles 
Throughout the trial in both treatment arms the 8 point SMPG profiles did not show the typical peak and 
trough profiles seen in adults with T1DM. In the IDeg arm there was a reduction in mean SMPG for the 
post-meal time points from baseline to 12 and 26 weeks.  
In some cases there were differences in the shape of the 8 point SMPG profiles across age groups and 
treatment arms, but no firm conclusions could be drawn based on age group due to variability of the data 
and low sample size. Profiles of 8 point SMPG for the all subjects and children (1-5 years) at 26 are presented 
by treatment in Figure 5. 
Figure 5 8-point self measured plasma glucose profile at 26 Weeks - mean plot – all subjects 
(left) and children 1-5 years (right) - full analysis set – trial 3561 
After 52 weeks of treatment, SMPG values were statistically significantly lower with IDeg+IAsp than with 
IDet+IAsp at post-breakfast, post-dinner and pre-breakfast on the second day. The mean of the 8-point 
profile was also statistically significantly lower after 52 weeks of treatment with IDeg+IAsp than with

IDet+IAsp. There were no statistically significant treatment differences in prandial plasma glucose 
increments or in the fluctuation in SMPG at week 52. 
Within the age groups, the observed results based on the 8-point SMPG profiles after 52 weeks of treatment 
were generally in line with those observed for all subjects. No obvious differences between age groups were 
observed for 8-point SMPG profiles, mean of the 8-point profiles, prandial increments or fluctuation with 
either treatment. 
Trial 3816 
8-point SMPG profiles 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences in the mean of the 8-point profile, in prandial 
plasma glucose increments (mean of all meals, breakfast, lunch and main evening meal) or in the SMPG 
fluctuation at week 16. 
Within the age groups, the shape of the 8-point SMPG profiles (Figure 5), fluctuation in plasma glucose and 
prandial increments followed the overall trend as seen for all subjects from baseline to week 16.

mean plot – by age group - full analysis set – trial 3816 
Insulin dose over time 
In both treatment groups in both trials, the mean total daily insulin dose increased gradually during the trial. 
At end of trial, the basal insulin requirement was higher in the IDet+IAsp treatment groups compared to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 24/45 
 
  
  
 
IDeg+IAsp and IDegAsp+IAsp treatment groups. In trial 3561, 64.0% of subjects were using IDet BID and 
in trial 3816, 54.2% of subjects were using IDet BID at the end of the trial. 
The difference between the treatment groups (IDeg+IAsp vs. IDet+IAsp and IDegAsp+IAsp vs. IDet+IAsp) 
was mainly due to the basal component, since bolus insulin doses were comparable for the treatment groups 
throughout the trials; the mean daily bolus insulin dose at end of trial was 0.55 and 0.58 units/kg for 
IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp (trial 3561) and 0.52 units/kg for both IDegAsp+IAsp and IDet+IAsp (trial 
3816). 
In both treatment groups in both trials, the mean daily dose of both basal and bolus insulin was lowest in 
children aged 1−5 years and highest in adolescents aged 12−17 years. Also, the basal:bolus split indicated 
that children aged 1−5 years used less basal and more bolus insulin compared to older children and 
adolescents as exemplified by the data from trial 3561 (Table 13). 
Table 13 Basal-bolus split of total daily insulin dose (units/kg) - summary – children (1−5 
years), children (6−11 years) and adolescents (12−17 years) – safety analysis set – trial 3561 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Insulin aspart was administered as bolus insulin in both treatment groups in both trials but different basal 
insulin products were administered in trial 3561 (IDeg and IDet) and in trial 3816 (IDegAsp and IDet); the 
data for these two trials have therefore not been pooled. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The data provided to support NovoRapid for use in paediatric patients down to 1 year of age comes from two 
3b studies; study 3561 with the extension study 3561 Ext and study 3816. Both studies were 
multi-national, multi-centre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, randomised, treat-to-target, efficacy and 
safety studies. Both studies were conducted in children and adolescents aged 1 to less than 18 years. At the 
time-point for initiation of Study 3816, Study 3561 had been completed. None of the studies (3561, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 25/45 
 
  
  
 
3816), were explicitly designed to assess the treatment efficacy of insulin aspart/NovoRapid in terms of 
HbA1c reduction among younger children. 
Study 3561 comprised a 26-week treatment period followed by a 26-week extension investigating long 
term safety (3561 Ext) and compared IDeg (test drug; marketed under the trade name Tresiba) with IDet 
(active comparator; marketed under the trade name Levemir). Study 3816 comprised a 16-week treatment 
period and compared IDegAsp (test drug; marketed under the trade name Ryzodeg) with IDet (active 
comparator). In both trials, Insulin Aspart was given as bolus insulin in combination with IDeg, IDegAsp and 
IDet as basal insulin. 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c (%) at week 26, study 3561 and week 16, study 
3816, respectively. The primary objective was to show non-inferiority using a non-inferiority margin of 
0.4%. The same assumptions were used in both studies for the calculation of the sample size. In both 
studies randomisation was 1:1 stratified by age groups (1−5 years; 6−11 years and 12−17 years). The 
statistical analysis approach was similar in the two studies although differed with regard to the primary 
analysis method. Overall, the analysis approach in each of the study is acceptable.  
Both studies were seemingly adequately designed and conducted according to their primary and secondary 
objectives, respectively. 
In each of the study, insulin aspart was given as bolus insulin in combination with different basal insulins in 
all treatment groups, hence, no assessments are available where the efficacy of insulin aspart has been 
compared to alternative bolus insulin keeping the basal insulin unchanged. Further, while it is an advantage 
that both studies were stratified by age none of the studies were powered to allow for statistical comparisons 
between the age groups. Therefore no statistical analyses were performed between age groups. Separate 
results for the age groups have however been presented to facilitate descriptive comparisons between 
treatment groups as well as between the age groups 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years within 
treatment group. To support the proposed extension of indication focus has been on the subgroup of 
subjects 1-5 years of age. Although the target number of subjects (to comply with approved PIPs) in this 
subgroup in each of the study was reached; at least 80 subjects in study 3561 and at least 60 subjects in 
study 3816 respectively, they comprise however the smallest subgroups and hence provides only limited 
data. 
In study 3561 a total of 350 children/adolescents were randomised, all but one in the IDet treatment group 
received study treatment. Of the randomised subjects, 24.3% (85/350) was in the age group 1-5 years, 
39.4% (138/350) in the age group 6-11 years and 36.3% (127/350) in the age group 12-17 years. Overall, 
a high proportion of the subjects completed the 26-week treatment period (95.7%) with, however, the 
lowest proportion among the youngest children; 92.9% (79/85) in the age group 1-5 years, 98.6% 
(136/138) in the age group 6-11 and 94.5% (120/127) in the age group 12-17. Across subgroups, there was 
slightly more completers in the IDeg OD than in the IDet treatment arm.  
In study 3816 a total of 362 children/adolescents were randomised, all but one in each treatment arm 
received study treatment. In study 3816 the age distribution was similar as seen in study 3561 with 22.7% 
(82/362), 33.7% (122/362) and 43.6% (158/362) in the age group 1-5 years, 6-11 years and 12-17 years 
of age respectively. Also in this study, a high proportion of the subjects completed the 16-week treatment 
period (94.5%) with most non-completers in the age group 1-5 years 90.2% (74/82) to be compared with 
97.5% (119/122) in the age group 6-11 and 94.3% (149/158) in the age group 12-17. Across subgroups, 
there was slightly more completers in the IDegAsp OD than in the IDet treatment arm. 
In total five (5) subjects aged 1-2 years were included. Four (4) subjects aged 1 year were included in trial 
3561; 2 to IDeg+IAsp (minimum age 1.5 years) and 2 to IDet+IAsp (minimum age 1.8 years). One (1) child 
included in trial 3816 was 1 year old; this child was randomised to the IDet+IAsp group and was 1.9 years 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 26/45 
 
  
  
old. The youngest child in the IDegAsp+IAsp group was 2.2 years old. Thus the number of patients in the age 
group 1-2 years is very limited. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Based on the primary and secondary objectives in each of the study focus was on the analyses of the primary 
and secondary endpoints based on all subjects. 
In study 3561 IDeg improved glycaemic control as measured by change in HbA1c and non-inferiority to IDet 
in terms of lowering HbA1c was confirmed, as the upper limit of the 95% CI for the estimated mean 
treatment difference was ≤ 0.4 %. 
In study 3816, IDegAsp OD + IAsp maintained glycaemic control as measured by change in HbA1c and 
non-inferiority to IDet + IAsp in terms of changing HbA1c was confirmed, as the upper limit of the 95% CI 
for the mean treatment difference was ≤ 0.4%. 
With regards to secondary endpoints, FPG decreased in the groups treated with IDeg (trial 3561) or 
IDegAsp (trial 3816) whereas FPG increased slightly with IDet in both trials. No relevant differences were 
observed between age groups. Thus the differences observed were most probably related to the basal 
insulin. 
There were no differences in the 8-point SMPG profiles, mean of the 8-point profiles, prandial increments or 
fluctuation between age groups in either of the trials. As these measures provide some information on the 
action of the bolus insulin, i.e. on the control of post-prandial glucose increments, the data provide some 
reassurance that the effect of insulin aspart is not different in the age group 1-5 years compared to older 
children/adolescents. 
The bolus insulin dose did not change much in any of the groups in either of the trials; instead the increase 
in total insulin dose was mainly due to an increase in basal insulin dose. It is noted that in the youngest age 
group, a somewhat higher proportion of the total insulin dose is given as bolus insulin compared to the older 
age groups. This may reflect a greater need to make dose adjustments due to changes in activity and food 
intake in this group. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Since none of the studies (3561, 3816) were designed to evaluate treatment with insulin aspart with 
regards to the effect on HbA1c, no assessments of the efficacy of insulin aspart per se can be made. 
Outcomes per age groups are presented descriptively, the number of subjects within age groups however 
being limited with the lowest number of children in the age group 1-5 years of age. Hence, no firm 
conclusions on the efficacy of insulin aspart per se or in the subgroup of small children (less than 2 years, in 
total 5 children) can be drawn. The data, however, does not indicate any differences in post-prandial glucose 
control either between treatment groups or between age groups. Furthermore, the efficacy with regards to 
HbA1c did not differ between age groups.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
NovoRapid has been on the market worldwide for more than a decade for the treatment of diabetes mellitus 
and is approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and 
above. The safety profile is well known, with the major safety issue being hypoglycaemia.

Patient exposure 
In trial 3561, the total exposure was 161.5 years in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group and 147.4 years in the 
IDet+IAsp treatment group. The mean exposure was comparable between the two treatment groups during 
the main part of the trial (first 26 weeks), but higher in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group than in the 
IDet+IAsp treatment group during the last 26 weeks, reflecting the higher proportion of subjects continuing 
on IDeg+IAsp compared to IDet+IAsp in the extension period of the trial. Approximately 87% of subjects in 
the IDeg+IAsp treatment group and 70% of subjects in the IDet+IAsp treatment group were exposed to the 
trial products for at least 49 weeks. Overall, the exposure between treatment groups was similar across all 
three age groups as expected due to the stratification. In total, 23.6%, 40.4% and 36.0% of children aged 
1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years were exposed. Four (4) subjects aged 1 year were exposed; 2 to 
IDeg+IAsp (both exposed for 1 year) and 2 to IDet+IAsp (1 exposed for 26 weeks and 1 for 1 year). 
Table 14 Exposure – descriptive statistics – safety analysis set – trial 3561  
In trial 3816, the total exposure was 54.8 years in the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group and 53.9 years in the 
IDet+IAsp treatment group. Approximately 96% of subjects were exposed for ≥16 weeks of treatment. The 
exposure between treatment groups was similar across all three age groups as expected due to the 
stratification. In total, 22.3%, 40.4% and 43.6% of children aged 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years 
were exposed. One (1) subject aged 1 year was exposed; the subject was treated with IDet+IAsp and 
exposed for 0.3 years.

Adverse events  
Common adverse events 
Trial 3561 
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs and the rate of AEs were similar in the IDeg+IAsp and the 
IDet+IAsp treatment groups (92.5% vs. 89.7% and 906 vs. 859 events per 100 PYE, respectively) (Table 
16). The majority of AEs in both treatment groups were non-serious, mild or moderate in severity and 
considered unlikely related to basal insulin and bolus insulin. Approximately 97% of all AEs in either 
treatment group had an outcome of recovered or recovering at end of trial. 
Table 16 Adverse events –safety analysis set – trial 3561 
The most frequently reported AEs across treatments were ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘headache’, ‘blood ketone body 
increased’, ‘upper respiratory tract infections’, ‘pyrexia’, ‘hypoglycaemia’, ‘oropharyngeal pain’ and ‘cough’. 
The percentage of subjects reporting AEs was similar across treatment groups in all three age groups. The 
rate of AEs was also similar across treatment groups and age groups, except for a higher rate of AEs reported 
for children aged 1−5 years in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group compared to the IDet+IAsp treatment group 
(1310 vs. 868 events per 100 PYE) (Table 16). The higher rates of AEs in the IDeg+IAsp 1−5 year age group 
were scattered across several SOCs, with the highest rates observed in relation to ‘infections and 
infestations’, ‘respiratory disorders’ and ‘gastrointestinal disorders’. Further, higher rates of ‘blood ketone 
increased’ were reported in the 1−5 year age group compared to the other age groups.

Trial 3816 
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs and the rate of AEs were similar in the IDegAsp+IAsp and 
IDet+IAsp treatment groups (77.9% vs. 74.9% and 915 vs. 853 events per 100 PYE) (Table 18). The 
majority of the AEs in both treatment groups were non-serious, mild in severity and considered unlikely 
related to basal insulin and bolus insulin. Approximately 75% of all subjects in both treatment groups had an 
outcome of recovered at end of trial. 
Table 18 Adverse events – safety analysis set – trial 3816 
The most frequently reported AEs in both treatment groups were “headache”, “nasopharyngitis”, “abdominal 
pain upper”, “pyrexia” and “vomiting”.

No unexpected differences among the three age groups were observed with respect to type of AEs. In the 
IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group, a higher rate of AEs was observed for children 1–5 years compared to the 
other age groups whereas a lower rate of AEs for children 1−5 years compared to the other age groups was 
observed in the IDet+IAsp treatment group (Table 18). The higher rate of AEs in the 1−5 year age group in 
the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group were scattered across several SOCs, with the highest rates observed in 
relation to “infections and infestations”, “general disorders and administration site condition (pyrexia)” and 
“gastrointestinal disorders”. 
Table 19 Frequent adverse events (≥10%), children 1–5 years – trial 3816 
Adverse events by relation to trial products 
Please note that an AE assessed as possibly or probably related to basal insulin (IDeg, IDegAsp or IDet) may 
also have been assessed as related to bolus insulin (IAsp). Further, an AE may also have been assessed as 
related to basal insulin only or to bolus insulin only. The number of AEs assessed as related to basal insulin 
and bolus insulin can therefore not be added to give the total number of AEs assessed as related to 
treatment. 
Trial 3561 
The vast majority of AEs were considered unlikely related to basal and bolus insulin as judged by the 
investigator. 
The rate of AEs considered as having a probable relation to basal insulin was comparable between 
treatments; 20 vs. 19 events per 100 PYE with IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp, respectively. The rate of AEs 
considered to have a possible relation to basal insulin was 50 vs. 39 events per 100 PYE. 
The rate of AEs considered as having a probable relation to bolus insulin was comparable between 
treatments with IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp; 26 vs. 19 events per 100 PYE, respectively. The rate of AEs 
considered to have a possible relation to bolus insulin was 53 vs. 45 events per 100 PYE. 
The most notable differences in AEs judged related to IDeg and/or IAsp and IDet and/or IAsp were related 
to ‘hypoglycaemia’, ‘blood ketone body increased’, and ‘administration site conditions’. 
Assessment report

Trial 3816 
The vast majority of AEs were considered unlikely related to IDegAsp, IDet and IAsp. 
The overall rates of AEs considered possibly or probably related to IDegAsp vs. IDet were 47 vs. 37 per 100 
PYE (26 vs. 20 events, respectively) and the overall rates of AEs considered possibly or probably related to 
IAsp, were 37 vs. 32 per 100 PYE (20 vs. 17 events, respectively). The most notable differences between the 
IDegAsp+IAsp and IDet+IAsp groups were hypoglycaemia-related AEs considered possibly or probably 
related to treatment, followed by events related to gastrointestinal disorders. 
Within the SOC ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, more events were reported as related to IDet compared to 
IDegAsp (5 vs. 0 events, respectively). All events were single occurrences under different preferred terms 
except for 2 events of ‘vomiting’. Further, more events were reported as related to IAsp in the IDet+IAsp 
group compared to the IDegAsp+IAsp group (5 vs. 1 events, respectively). All events were single 
occurrences under different preferred terms. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Trial 3561 
No deaths were reported. 
The rates of SAEs were generally low and similar for IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp, both overall, across severity 
and causality categories, and with respect to recovery. The majority of SAEs were considered unlikely 
related to IDeg, IDet and IAsp and with an outcome of ‘recovered’ at end of trial. The low number of subjects 
with SAEs as well as the low number of SAEs should be taken into consideration when evaluating rates 
between treatment groups as these comparisons are based on a low number of subjects with few events 
(Table 20). 
Table 20 Serious adverse events – safety analysis set – trial 3561 
The most frequently reported SAEs in both treatment groups were related to infections, hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia (“ketosis”, “diabetic ketoacidosis” and “blood ketone body increased”); however, no SAEs 
were reported by ≥5% of subjects. 
Five (5) hypoglycaemia-related SAEs in each treatment group were considered possibly or probably related 
to basal insulin. In each treatment group, 4 of the 5 hypoglycaemia-related SAEs considered related to IDeg 
and IDet were also considered related to IAsp and 1 event in each treatment group was considered related 
to IDeg or IDet only. No hypoglycaemia-related SAEs were related to IAsp only. 
Within each of the age groups, the number of subjects reporting SAEs was low (Table 20) and hence a 
comparison of SAEs across treatment groups within age groups is not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
In both treatment groups, most of the events were single episodes in a single subject. Hypoglycaemia 
related SAEs were seen in all age groups whereas hyperglycaemia (“ketosis”, “diabetic ketoacidosis” and 
“blood ketone body increased”) was only reported in the youngest age group. 
Assessment report

Trial 3816 
No deaths were reported. 
The rates of SAEs were generally low, however, higher with IDegAsp+IAsp than with IDet+IAsp (Table 21). 
No differences were seen between treatment groups with respect to severity and causality categories, and 
with respect to recovery. The low number of SAEs should be taken into consideration when evaluating rates 
between treatment groups as these comparisons are based on a low number of subjects with few events. 
Table 21 Serious adverse events – safety analysis set – trial 3816  
For IDegAsp+IAsp, the most frequently reported SAEs were hypoglycaemia-related AEs (6 events compared 
to 1 event in the IDet+IAsp treatment group). All other SAEs were single occurrences in both treatment 
groups and no SAEs were reported by ≥5% of subjects. 
All but 1 of the hypoglycaemia related SAEs events in the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group were considered 
possibly or probably related to IDegAsp and 4 of these events were also considered related to IAsp. The 
event in the IDet+IAsp treatment group was considered unlikely related to IDet but possibly related to IAsp. 
Within each of the age groups, the number of subjects reporting SAEs was low and hence no clinically 
meaningful conclusions can be drawn for SAE trends at age group level (Table 21). The majority of the SAEs 
were single events. Hypoglycaemia related SAEs were seen in all age groups and hyperglycaemia related 
SAEs were seen in the age groups 1−5 years (‘hyperglycaemia’) and 12−17 years (‘diabetic ketoacidosis’). 
Laboratory findings 
Hypoglycaemia 
Definitions of hypoglycaemia 
In both trials, classification of hypoglycaemia was performed in accordance with the ISPAD 2009 
classification18, which are in line with the principles underlying the ADA classification. Furthermore, 
hypoglycaemia was classified according to a Novo Nordisk definition of ‘confirmed hypoglycaemia’. In 
normal physiology, hypoglycaemia symptoms occur at a plasma glucose level of approximately <3.1 
mmol/L. Therefore, Novo Nordisk used this cut-off value to define ‘confirmed hypoglycaemia’. 
In addition, classification of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia was performed by an independent, 
external paediatric endocrinologist in both trials. Assessing whether a hypoglycaemic episode fulfils this 
broad definition of severe hypoglycaemia is challenging, particularly when considering the more subjective 
criteria of 'altered mental status and cannot assist in his own care' for episodes involving young children. 
Due to this challenge, an independent, external paediatric endocrinologist conducted a blinded pre-specified 
classification of all reported episodes of severe hypoglycaemia to ensure a centralised expert assessment of 
severe hypoglycaemia. The assessment was based on case narratives and laboratory values. The statistical 
comparison of rates of severe hypoglycaemia was based on the investigator’s classification.

Confirmed hypoglycaemia 
Trial 3561 
The rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was similar for the IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp treatment groups (5771 
vs. 5405 episodes per 100 PYE; Table 22) and no statistically significant difference was seen. The majority 
of the confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during daytime (diurnal) in both treatment groups. 
In both treatment groups, the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was either lower or similar for children aged 
1−5 years compared to the overall rate (Table 22). The majority of the confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
occurred during the daytime (diurnal) across all age groups. 
Table 22 Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – safety analysis set – trial 3561 
Trial 3816 
Similar rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia were observed in the IDegAsp+IAsp and IDet+IAsp treatment 
groups (4623 vs. 4955 episodes per 100 PYE; Table 23) with no statistically significant difference between 
the groups. The majority of the confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during daytime (diurnal) in both 
treatment groups. 
In both treatment groups, the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was lower for children aged 1−5 years 
compared to the overall rate (Table 23). As seen in trial 3561, a higher rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was 
seen in children aged 6–11 years. The majority of the confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during 
the daytime (diurnal) across all age groups.

Severe hypoglycaemia 
Trial 3561 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had no episodes of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia 
(82% and 86% of subjects with IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp, respectively) and the percentage of days without 
ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia was similar (99.9%) for the two treatment groups. The overall number 
and rate of ISPAD defined severe episodes of hypoglycaemia were higher in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group 
than the IDet+IAsp treatment group (Table 24), but no statistically significant difference between treatment 
groups was seen. 
When evaluating severe hypoglycaemia it is important to note that these were distributed unevenly between 
subjects. In all, 11 subjects (3.2%) reported 4 or more episodes of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia: 8 
subjects in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group (3 in the age group 1−5 years, 4 in the age group 6−11 years 
and 1 in the age group 12−17 years) and 3 subjects in the IDet+IAsp treatment group (2 in the age group 
6−11 years and 1 in the age group 12−17 years. In the IDeg+IAsp treatment group, these 8 subjects 
(4.6%) accounted for more than half of all reported episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (42 events). In the 
IDet+IAsp treatment group, these 3 subjects (1.7%) accounted for 17 events (35%). 
The majority of the ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemic episodes (close to 80%) occurred during daytime 
(diurnal) in both treatment groups. In the majority of cases, bolus insulin was the last insulin administered 
prior to the event. 
Table 24 Severe hypoglycaemic episodes – safety analysis set – trial 3561 
The evaluation of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia was based on few subjects in each age group (6 to 
14 subjects across age groups) with relatively few episodes and the data should be interpreted with caution. 
In both treatment groups, the rate of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia was similar for children aged 1−5 
years compared to the overall rate (Table 24). The higher rate in the 6−11 year age group in the IDeg+IAsp 
treatment group was driven by 5 subjects reporting 22 of the 28 episodes reported during the extension 
period. 
An independent, external paediatric endocrinologist conducted a blinded pre-specified classification (‘altered 
mental status and cannot assist in his care’, ‘semiconscious or unconscious’ and ‘coma ± convulsion’) of all 
reported episodes of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia to ensure a centralised expert assessment of 
severe hypoglycaemia. In the age groups 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years, ‘altered mental status 
and cannot assist in his care’ was seen in 9 subjects (14 episodes), 15 subjects (35 episodes) and 8 subjects 
(15 episodes), respectively. ‘Semiconscious or unconscious’ was seen in 1 subject (1 episode), 8 subjects (8 
episodes) and 4 subjects (8 episodes) in the age groups 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years, 
respectively. ‘Coma ± convulsion’ was seen in 6 subjects (10 episodes), 4 subjects (5 episodes) and 3 
subjects (3 episodes) in the age groups 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 35/45 
 
  
  
 
The rate of severe hypoglycaemic episodes assessed by the independent, external paediatric endocrinologist 
was lower in both treatment groups and for all age groups compared to the rate of severe ISPAD defined 
hypoglycaemic episodes. 
Trial 3816 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had no severe hypoglycaemic episodes (93.9% and 
98.3% in the IDegAsp+IAsp and IDet+IAsp treatment groups, respectively). The majority of the severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during daytime (diurnal) in both treatment groups. The overall number 
and rate of ISPAD defined severe episodes of hypoglycaemia were higher in the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment 
group than the IDet+IAsp treatment group (Table 25), but no statistically significant difference between 
treatment groups was seen. 
Table 25 Severe hypoglycaemic episodes – safety analysis set – trial 3816 
The evaluation of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia was based on few subjects in each age group (0 to 
4 subjects across age groups) with few episodes. Consequently, comparisons within age groups should be 
interpreted with caution. In both treatment groups, the rate of ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemia was 
higher for children aged 1−5 years compared to the overall rate (Table 25). 
As in trial 3561, a blinded pre-specified classification of all reported episodes of ISPAD defined severe 
hypoglycaemia was conducted by an independent, external paediatric endocrinologist. “Altered mental 
status and cannot assist in his care” was seen in 2 subjects in each age group (with 3, 2 and 2 episodes in 
the age groups 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years, respectively). “Semiconscious or unconscious” was 
seen in 3 subjects (3 episodes) and 2 subjects (3 episodes) in the age groups 1−5 years and 12−17 years, 
respectively. “Coma ± convulsion” was seen in 1 subject in each age group (with 1, 2 and 1 episodes in the 
age groups 1−5 years, 6−11 years and 12−17 years, respectively). 
Except for 1 event in the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group, all the ISPAD defined severe hypoglycaemic 
episodes was also assessed as severe by the external paediatric endocrinologist.  
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
Trial 3561 
Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
The proportions of subjects with nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia were similar for the two treatment 
groups, while the observed rate of nocturnal confirmed episodes was lower with IDeg+IAsp compared to 
IDet+IAsp, (603 and 760 episodes per 100 PYE, respectively) (Table 26), but no statistically significant 
difference between treatment groups was seen. 
The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes increased with increasing age in both treatment 
groups (Table 26). The higher rate in adolescents compared to the younger age groups may be attributed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 36/45 
 
  
  
 
adolescent lifestyle as they are expected to be more active during the period defined as “nocturnal” in this 
trial. 
Table 26 Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – safety analysis set – trial 3561 
Nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
The number of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes was low in both treatment groups; 18 episodes in 
10 subjects in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group and 10 episodes in 9 subjects in the IDet+IAsp treatment 
group corresponding to a rate of 11 and 7 episodes per 100 PYE, respectively, which precluded meaningful 
statistical comparison between treatments. 
In children aged 1−5 years and adolescents aged 12−17 years, 3 nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
were reported in each treatment group. In the age group 6−11 years, 12 episodes in 7 subjects were 
reported in the IDeg+IAsp treatment group and 4 episodes in 4 subjects in the IDet+IAsp treatment group. 
Trial 3816 
Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
The observed rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were similar with IDegAsp+IAsp and 
IDet+IAsp (577 and 540 episodes per 100 PYE) and there was no statistically significant difference between 
treatment groups. 
As seen in trial 3561, the rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes increased with increasing age 
in both treatment groups (Table 27). 
Table 27 Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – safety analysis set – trial 3816 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/605453/2016 
Page 37/45 
 
  
  
 
 
Nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
The number of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes was low in both treatment groups (2 episodes in 
each group), which precluded meaningful statistical comparison between treatments. In the IDegAsp+IAsp 
treatment group, both nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in 1 subject (age group 6–
11 years) and the episodes in the IDet+IAsp treatment group were reported by 1 subject in the age group 
1–5 years and 1 subject in the age group 12–17 years. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Trial 3561 
In trial 3561, the threshold for defining hyperglycaemia was 11.1 mmol/L, which is considered relatively low 
especially for a paediatric T1DM population. Thus, the high number of hyperglycaemic episodes is not 
surprising. In both treatment groups, all subjects experienced hyperglycaemic episodes and with similar 
observed rates (Table 28); no statistically significant difference between treatment groups was seen. 
A statistically significantly lower rate of hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis (blood ketones >1.5 mmol/L) 
was observed with IDeg+IAsp compared to IDet+IAsp. The lower rate of ketosis with IDeg+IAsp was 
observed across all age groups (Table 28) which is consistent with the lower rate of “blood ketone bodies 
increased” reported as AEs with IDeg+IAsp compared to IDet+IAsp. 
In both treatment groups, children aged 1−5 years had a higher rate of hyperglycaemic episodes with 
ketosis compared to the two older age groups, albeit these differences were based on a relatively low 
number of subjects with ketosis (Table 28).  
Table 28 Hyperglycaemic episodes and episodes of ketosis – safety analysis set – trial 3561 
Trial 3816 
In trial 3816, the threshold for defining hyperglycaemia was higher than the threshold in trial 3561 (14.0 
mmol/L compared to 11.1 mmol/L). A similar proportion of subjects experienced hyperglycaemic episodes; 
39.8% with IDegAsp+IAsp and 40.8% with IDet+IAsp (Table 29) and no statistically significant difference 
between treatment groups was seen in rates of hyperglycaemic episodes. 
Further, no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the rates of hyperglycaemic 
episodes with ketosis were seen (blood ketones >1.5 mmol/L). In the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group 6

events were reported for 4 subjects compared to 12 events reported for 8 subjects in the IDet+IAsp 
treatment group (Table 29). 
Across the three age groups, children aged 6–11 years in the IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group had a higher 
rate of hyperglycaemic episodes compared to the other age groups in both treatment groups. Within each of 
the age groups, the number of subjects reporting hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis was low (Table 29). 
Table 29 Hyperglycaemic episodes and episodes of ketosis – safety analysis set – trial 3816 
Antibodies 
Antibodies to trial products were only measured in trial 3561. 
There was no indication of a differential development of tolerance to insulin with IDeg and IDet, nor was 
there any indication of antibody development against IAsp. The observed mean levels of insulin antibodies 
cross-reacting to human insulin decreased slightly with IDeg and increased slightly with IDet. The same 
patterns were observed for the three age groups, though the mean levels at baseline varied slightly with age 
being highest in children aged 1−5 years in both treatment groups. 
The levels of IDeg-, IDet- and IAsp-specific antibodies remained low throughout the treatment period and 
the same pattern was observed for the three age groups. No apparent correlation between antibodies and 
HbA1c or between antibodies and total daily insulin dose was seen. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Mean biochemistry, haematology and lipid laboratory values remained stable during trials 3561 and 3816, 
and there were no apparent differences between the two treatment groups in the mean level of the specific 
laboratory parameters assessed. The majority of subjects’ values remained within the reference ranges at 
baseline and at the end of trial. Few clinically relevant changes from baseline in individual laboratory 
parameters were reported as AEs. None of the AEs were severe or serious and none were considered as 
having a possible or probable relation to IDeg, IDegAsp, IDet or IAsp. 
Other safety assessments 
No clinically relevant differences from baseline to end of treatment were observed for vital signs and physical 
examination between IDeg+IAsp and IDet+IAsp (trial 3561) or between IDegAsp+IAsp and IDet+IAsp 
(trial 3816).

An increase in weight SD score was seen in the IDeg+IAsp and IDegAsp+IAsp treatment groups and a 
decrease was seen in both IDet+IAsp treatment groups during the treatment periods (52 weeks for trial 
3561 and 16 weeks for trial 3816). The changes from baseline were statistically significantly different 
between treatment groups indicating less weight gain with IDet+IAsp compared with IDeg+IAsp and 
IDegAsp+IAsp. This is in accordance with the results from previous studies showing that adult and paediatric 
subjects with T1DM and adults with T2DM typically gain less weight with IDet than with other basal insulin 
products.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In trial 3561, 3 subjects (1 from each age group, all in the IDet+IAsp treatment group) withdrew from the 
trial due to an AEs: 1 due to “wrong dose administered” (non-serious), 1 due to “anxiety disorder”(serious) 
and 1 due to “hypoglycaemia seizure” (serious). The anxiety disorder was considered unlikely related to IDet 
and IAsp while the two other events were considered probably or possibly related to IDet and IAsp. 
In trial 3816, 1 subject (age group 6−11 years, IDegAsp+IAsp treatment group) was withdrawn from the 
trial due to a non-serious AE of “hypoglycaemic seizure”. The event was considered probably related to 
IDegAsp and unlikely related to IAsp. Additionally, 1 subject (age group 12−17 years, IDet+IAsp treatment 
group) withdrew due to “intermittent but recurrent hypoglycaemia attributed to trial product” reported 
under “other” reasons for withdrawal. 
Post marketing experience 
Review of the cumulative post-marketing safety data received for children aged above 1 year and below 2 
years in the period from 1 January 2002 to 27 February 2016 has not identified any safety concerns in 
connection with the use of NovoRapid in this age group. The evaluation is based on more than 45 case 
reports. Further, no unexpected or medically significant patterns have been observed in the cumulative 
post-marketing experience of NovoRapid in type, distribution or seriousness of post-marketing adverse drug 
reactions reported for children aged 1 year, as compared to children aged 2 to 18 years. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The focus of this safety discussion will be on the data generated in the age group 1-5 years. In total the two 
trials have generated 97 years of exposure in this age group. Five children aged 1-2 years were included in 
the two trials. From the exposure data it may be concluded that all these children completed the main 
studies and three out of four children included in trial 3561 also completed the extension phase of the study. 
Thus, albeit limited, these data indicate that the treatment with insulin aspart in children aged 1-2 years old 
is tolerated.  
Although the percentage of patients reporting AEs was lowest in the youngest age group in trial 3561, the 
reporting rate per 100 exposure years was highest in this group. The most common events were related to 
infections and GI disorders as may be expected in this age group. “Blood ketone body increased” was 
reported at a higher rate in the youngest age group compared to the safety analysis set (114 events per 100 
PYE vs 70 events per 100 PYE). In trial 3816, a comparable pattern was observed. The highest rates were 
observed for infections and GI disorders, again which are common SOCs for AEs for this paediatric age 
group.

In both trials, only a small proportion of events were considered probably or possibly related to insulin 
treatment (in the range of 10%, many events assessed related to both basal and bolus insulin). The rate of 
events considered related was numerically similar for basal and bolus insulin. 
In both trials, the number of SAEs were few and in most cases not considered related to treatment. Ten 
hypoglycaemia events were recorded in trial 3561, none of which was considered related to IAsp only. 
Hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia related events were only reported in the youngest age group. In trial 
3816, seven hypoglycaemia events were recorded, one of which was considered related to IAsp only. 
Hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia related events were reported in the youngest and oldest age groups. 
Hypoglycaemia, being the major safety issue with insulin treatment, was analysed in detail. Acceptable 
definitions of hypoglycaemia were applied and severe hypoglycaemia events were also assessed by an 
independent external paediatric endocrinologist. 
In trial 3561, compared to the overall rate of confirmed hypoglycaemias, the event rates were similar or 
lower in the age group 1-5 years. In trial 3816, the event rates were lower in the age group 1-5 years in both 
treatment arms. The highest rate was observed in children aged 6–11 years in both trials, which may be due 
to challenges in controlling glycaemia during school hours. Most hypoglycaemias occurred during daytime, 
thus may be potentially be attributable to bolus insulin. 
The majority of patients never experienced any severe hypoglycaemia (82-86% in trial 3561 and 94-98% 
in trial 3816). The rate of severe hypoglycaemias did not differ in the youngest age group compared to the 
overall population in trial 3561 but was higher in the youngest age group compared to the overall population 
in trial 3816. This is possibly related to the basal insulin therapy as mixed insulin (IDegAsp) offers less 
flexibility in dosing. It is noted that bolus insulin was often the latest insulin dose given before the event at 
least in trial 3561. 
The rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias was lower in the youngest age group compared to the overall 
population in both trials. Very few severe nocturnal events were recorded (28 events, trial 3561; 4 events, 
trial 3816). In the youngest age group, in total 6 episodes occurred in in trial 3561 and 1 in trial 3816. 
Hyperglycaemia, being a marker for inadequate insulin dosing, was also analysed in more detail. In trial 
3561 a low cut-off for hyperglycaemia was applied which in part explains the high rates observed in this 
trial. No relevant differences between age groups were observed. Events of ketosis were more frequent in 
the youngest age group. This may possibly be related to the higher rates of “infections and infestations” 
observed in the youngest age group, but also that fluctuations in blood glucose levels are usual. It may also 
be that insulin is sometimes given at too low doses in this age group due to fear of hypoglycaemia which may 
be more difficult to diagnose and handle in young children. In trial 3816, a higher cut-off was applied which 
is reflected in lower rates of hyperglycaemia in this trial. Apart from a higher reporting in children 6-11 years 
treated with IDegAsp, the rates were comparable across age groups. Again the rate of ketosis was 
somewhat higher in the age group 1-5 years. 
There was no difference in the levels of IDeg-, IDet- and IAsp-specific antibodies across age groups and the 
levels remained low. 
As expected, clinical laboratory evaluations did not show any relevant changes. 
Some differences in weight were observed between treatment groups, with less weight gain in the IDet 
treated groups. This is in line with previous data for IDet. 
No subjects in the age group 1-5 years of age withdrew due to AEs. 
During the period from 1 January 2002 to 27 February 2016 for which NovoRapid has been on the market, 
the MAH claims that no safety concerns have arisen for the age group 1-2 years. This is based on 45 case 
reports.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
With trials 3561 and 3816, additional safety data on insulin aspart has been provided for children and 
adolescents. In particular, data in 165 younger children 1-5 years of age is available, including five children 
1-2 years of age. The data give no indication of a different safety profile in younger children compared to 
older children and no new safety concerns arise. Notably, the rate of hypoglycaemias was numerically lower 
in the youngest age group compared to the older age groups. A higher occurrence of hyperglycaemia related 
events in the youngest age group possibly reflects the difficulties in calculating the optimal dose in these 
children while avoiding hypoglycaemia.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
No RMP was submitted with this variation, and this was accepted. The information in the RMP can be aligned 
at the occasion of the next RMP update. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The following changes to the SmPC were accepted in the 
context of this variation. 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
NovoRapid is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 2 years 
and above.  
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Paediatric population 
NovoRapid can be used in children and adolescents and children aged 1 2 years and above in preference to 
soluble human insulin when a rapid onset of action might be beneficial (see sections 5.1 and 5.2)., fFor 
example, in the timing of the injections in relation to meals (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  
The safety and efficacy of NovoRapid in children below 1 2 years of age have not been established. No data 
are available.  
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Especially in 
children, care should be taken to match insulin doses (especially in basal-bolus regimens) with food intake, 
physical activities and current blood glucose level in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of NovoRapid given as bolus insulin in combination with either insulin detemir or 
insulin degludec as basal insulin has been studied for up to 12 months, in two randomised controlled clinical 
Assessment report

trials in adolescents and children aged 1 to less than 18 years (n=712). The trials included 167 children aged 
1-5 years, 260 aged 6-11 and 285 aged 12-17. The observed improvements in HbA1c and the safety profiles 
were comparable between all age groups. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Both studies (3561, 3816) were designed to evaluate the efficacy in terms of glycaemic control, i.e. HbA1c, 
of the basal insulin regimens. Therefore no firm conclusions on the effect of insulin aspart on HbA1c per se 
or in the subgroup of small children (less than 2 years, in total 5 children) can be drawn. There is no 
indication of a difference in the effect on HbA1c across age groups. The 8-point SMPG profiles, which reflect 
the effect of the bolus insulin on postprandial glucose levels, were comparable between treatments and 
across age groups.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No comparisons between insulin aspart and other bolus insulins have been provided.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety data from trials 3561 and 3816 is based on a total of 709 children and adolescent out of which 
165 patients were aged 1-5 years. In total the two trials have generated 97 years of exposure in the 
youngest age group. Five children aged 1-2 years were included in the two trials. From the exposure data it 
may be concluded that all these children completed the main studies and three out of four children included 
in trial 3561 also completed the extension phase of the study. Thus, albeit limited, these data indicate that 
the treatment with insulin aspart in children aged 1-2 years old is well tolerated.  
The reporting rate of adverse events per 100 exposure years was highest in the age group 1-5 years in both 
trials. The most common events were related to infections and GI disorders as may be expected in this age 
group. “Blood ketone body increased” was reported at a higher rate in the youngest age group compared to 
the safety analysis set in trial 3561 (114 events per 100 PYE vs 70 events per 100 PYE). In both trials, only 
a small proportion of events were considered probably or possibly related to insulin treatment (in the range 
of 10%, many events assessed related to both basal and bolus insulin therefore no exact figure is given).  
In both trials, SAEs were few and in most cases not considered related to treatment. Ten (10) 
hypoglycaemia events classified as SAEs were recorded in trial 3561, none of which was considered related 
to IAsp only. Hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia related events, classified as SAEs, were only reported in 
the youngest age group. In trial 3816, seven (7) hypoglycaemia events classified as SAEs were recorded, 
one (1) of which was considered related to IAsp only. Hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia related events 
were reported in the youngest and oldest age groups. 
In trial 3561, compared to the overall rate of confirmed hypoglycaemias, the event rates were similar or 
lower in the age group 1-5 years. In trial 3816, the event rates were lower in the age group 1-5 years in both 
treatment arms. The highest rate was observed in children aged 6–11 years in both trials, which may be due

to challenges in controlling glycaemia during school hours. Most hypoglycaemias occurred during daytime, 
thus may be potentially be attributable to bolus insulin. 
The majority of patients never experienced any severe hypoglycaemia (82-86% in trial 3561 and 94-98% 
in trial 3816). The rate of severe hypoglycaemias did not differ in the youngest age group compared to the 
overall population in trial 3561 but was higher in the youngest age group compared to the overall population 
in trial 3816. This is possibly related to the basal insulin therapy as mixed insulin (IDegAsp) offers less 
flexibility in dosing. It is noted that bolus insulin was often the latest insulin dose given before the event at 
least in trial 3561. The rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias was lower in the youngest age group compared to 
the overall population in both trials. Very few severe nocturnal events were recorded (28 events, trial 3561; 
4 events, trial 3816). In the youngest age group, in total 6 episodes occurred in in trial 3561 and 1 in trial 
3816. 
Hyperglycaemia, being a marker for inadequate insulin dosing, was also analysed in more detail. In trial 
3561, no relevant differences between age groups were observed. Events of ketosis were more frequent in 
the youngest age group. This may possibly be related to the higher rates of “infections and infestations” 
observed in the youngest age group, but also that fluctuations in blood glucose levels are usual. It may also 
be that insulin is sometimes given at too low doses in this age group due to fear of hypoglycaemia which may

children 6-11 years treated with IDegAsp, the rates were comparable across age groups. Again the rate of 
ketosis was somewhat higher in the age group 1-5 years. 
There was no difference in the levels of IDeg-, IDet- and IAsp-specific antibodies across age groups and the 
levels remained low, and as expected, clinical laboratory evaluations did not show any relevant changes. 
Some differences in weight were observed between treatment groups, with less weight gain in the IDet 
treated groups. This is in line with previous data for IDet. 
Notably, no subjects in the age group 1-5 years of age withdrew due to AEs. 
No safety concerns have arisen for the age group 1-2 years from post-marketing experience. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No comparative data have been provided, however, the two trials submitted have provided an substantially 
expanded safety data base in the youngest age group, 1-5 years. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
T1DM is rare in very young children but insulin treatment is mandatory to prevent death, irrespective of age. 
With the current submission, further data to support the use of NovoRapid in children aged 1-2 year has 
been provided. Although the studies were not designed to investigate the efficacy of the bolus treatment, but 
the basal insulin, the data is considered sufficient to support that NovoRapid is efficient also in the age group 
1-2 years of age since no differences in efficacy was observed between age groups.  
In this context it should be noted that the use of insulin aspart in children aged 2 years and older was 
approved in procedure EMEA/H/C/258/II/34 in March 2005, based on one open label, cross-over trial 
conducted in 26 children, aged 2-6 years, with type I diabetes in which 12 weeks treatment with IAsp and 
human insulin was compared. In this trial, six children were between 6-7 years old, while only four children 
were younger than four years. The CHMP considered, however, that on scientific grounds it would be 
possible to extrapolate experience from older children to provide sufficient reassurance regarding efficacy 
and safety within the claimed age range. With the data submitted with trials 3561 and 3816, the clinical 
experience within the trial context is expanded with a relatively large number of subjects in the age 1-5 
years (165 patients) without any indication of a different effect when compared to older children and

adolescents. Although the number of patients in the age group 1-2 years is low (5 subjects), there is no 
reason to believe that the effect is different in this age group compared to patients aged 2 years and above. 
With trials 3561 and 3816, additional safety data on insulin aspart has been provided for children and 
adolescents. In particular, data in younger children 1-5 years of age is available, including data in five 
children 1-2 years of age. The data give no indication of a different safety profile in younger children 
compared to older children and no new safety concerns arise. Hypoglycaemia occurred, with one exception 
(IDeg/Asp treated children), at similar or lower rates than in other age groups. A higher occurrence of 
hyperglycaemia related events in the youngest age group possibly reflects the difficulties in calculating the 
optimal dose in these children while avoiding hypoglycaemia. Taking into account that children aged 1-2 
year possibly are under closer monitoring by their caregivers than older children, hypo- and hyperglycaemic 
events can be handled. Furthermore, all children in the age group 1-2 years completed the studies, 
indicating that the treatment was well tolerated. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance for NovoRapid in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in children aged 1-2 year of age 
is considered positive.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This Article 46 procedure reflects a non-controlled, open-label study of rFVIIIFc for immune tolerance 
induction (ITI) in 16 severe hemophilia A subjects with inhibitors undergoing their first ITI treatment. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
Study No. LPS16473/997HA402/verITI-8 
Title: A non-controlled, open-label, multicenter study of efficacy of rFVIIIFc for immune tolerance 
induction (ITI) in severe hemophilia A subjects with inhibitors undergoing the first ITI treatment. 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: To describe the time to tolerization (ITI success, i.e. inhibitor titer <0.6 Bethesda 
Units (BU)/mL, rFVIIIFc incremental recovery [IR] ≥66% within a maximum of 12 months (48 weeks) 
of ITI treatment with rFVIIIFc. 
Study design 
This was a prospective, global, open-label, single-arm study of up to 17 patients. The maximum 
individual study duration was expected to be up to 12 months of ITI with a total study duration of 
approximately 2 years. Males of all ages with severe hemophilia A and high-titer inhibitors (historical

peak ≥5 BU/mL) received recombinant coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) for first-time 
ITI therapy, in order to eradicate anti-coagulation factor VIII inhibitors. 
The study consisted of 4 periods: 
1) a 4-week Screening Period 
2) a maximum of a 48-week ITI Period 
3) a minimum of a 16-week Tapering Period for patients that achieved ITI success 
4) a 32-week Follow-Up Period 
During the Tapering Period, the patient’s dose was adjusted with the aim of tapering the dose to reach 
a dosing regimen suitable for effective prophylaxis. Length and dosing schedules were left to the 
discretion of the treating physician. 
Patients not achieving ITI success did not enter the Tapering or Follow-up Periods and were to proceed 
to the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit. 
Throughout the study, patients could receive bypassing agents (BPA) as needed for control of active 
bleeding. All treatments were to be collected in a study-specific electronic patient diary.

Statistical Methods 
Primary endpoint: Number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25th and 75th 
quartiles, minimum, and maximum (descriptive statistics); Kaplan-Meier estimates for median, 25th 
and 75th quartiles; Kaplan-Meier plot showing the percentage of patients who were tolerized against 
time from the first ITI infusion. 
Patients not achieving ITI success during the ITI Period of 48 weeks were censored at the latest date 
with a positive inhibitor titer data. 
ITI Full Analysis Set was used for these analyses. 
Secondary endpoints: Descriptive statistics. 
[An interim analysis was originally planned when at least 10 patients had completed at least 24 weeks 
(6 months) of ITI treatment. Interim data were analyzed (data cut off 23 Jan 2019) and published for 
presentation at the 27th Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 6–10 
July 2019. 
The same statistical analyses were used for the interim and final analyses, with the final data 
presented in this study report. Additions to the final analyses are a summary table of protocol 
deviations, 2 listings (ITI treatment outcomes, time to tolerization, and Periods) and 1 figure (Kaplan-
Meier plot of time to tolerization).] 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Population characteristics: 
16 Patients were enrolled into the study, all of whom completed the trial. No patients were 
permanently discontinued from treatment and/or the study due to a TEAE. 
The majority of patients (75.0%) were White with a non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity (87.5%). 
Patients had been previously treated with FVIII products and had a historical peak FVIII inhibitor titer 
≥5 BU/mL. The mean (SD) historical inhibitor titer at study entry was 67.1 (Min 6.2, Max 256) BU/mL.  
Baseline data 
Mean (SD) age at the time of study entry was 3.8 (4.06) years, with a range of 0.8 to 16 years. Mean 
inhibitor titer at rFVIIIFc initiation was 24.0 (Min 0.7, Max 144) BU/mL. Number of exposure days at 
first confirmed inhibitor development was <25 ED for 8 subjects, 25-50 ED for 5 subjects, 51-100 ED 
for 2 subjects and >100 ED for 1 subject. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint: 
10 patients (62.5%) met all 3 prespecified criteria and achieved ITI success/tolerization. Of the 10 
patients who reached tolerization, the median time to tolerization was 11.7 weeks with a range of 8.1 
to 49.8 weeks. There were no early withdrawals from ITI during the ITI Period. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Of the patients not having achieved ITI success, 1 patient (6.3%) achieved only partial success and 5 
patients (31.3%) were considered treatment failures. Of the 10 patients achieving ITI success, all

entered and completed the Tapering and Follow-up Periods per the protocol. None relapsed to a 
positive inhibitor titer for FVIII during the Tapering and Follow-up Periods. The duration of follow-up for 
relapse was a minimum of 4 months for the Tapering Period with a subsequent 8-month Follow-Up 
Period. 
The overall median ABR in 10 successfully tolerized patients was highest during the ITI Period (3.8, 
range 0;31.6). In comparison, the overall median ABR was lower in the Tapering Period (0, range 
0;2.7). The overall median ABR remained low in the Follow-up Period (0; 0;9.3). 
ITI success was accompanied by an increased percentage of patients without reported bleeding 
episodes. The percentage of patients without reported bleeding episodes was lowest during the ITI 
Period: 7 patients (43.8%). There were 6 patients (60%) without bleeding episodes during the 
Tapering Period and 7 patients (70.0%) without bleeding episodes during the Follow-up Period. 
Median annualized consumption of rFVIIIFc during the ITI-period was 70677 (range 37179;75527), in 
the tapering period 22342 (range 15651;40465), and in the fup-period 9210 (range 6311;32572). 
Safety results 
Overall (all 3 study periods combined), 220 TEAEs were reported in 16 patients (100%). Of these, 28 
TESAEs were reported in 9 patients (56.3%). Most TEAEs were reported during the ITI Period: 165 
TEAEs were reported in 14 patients (87.5). During the ITI Period, most TESAEs were reported in only 1 
patient by PT; the most frequently reported events by PT were vascular device infection, contusion, 
and hemarthrosis, reported in 2 patients (12.5%) each. The types and incidence of TESAEs observed in 
this study were consistent with what is expected for the severe hemophilia A population and none were 
considered to be related to study drug. Of note, there were no TESAEs associated with a bleeding 
episode. 
No thrombotic events were reported over the duration of the trial. No Grade 2 or greater allergic 
reactions in association with administration of rFVIIIFc were reported. No relapses to a positive 
inhibitor titer were reported in patients who had achieved ITI success. There were no deaths reported 
during the study. No patients were permanently discontinued from treatment and/or the study due to a 
TEAE or TESAE.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Results of the presented ITI-study in 16 severe haemophilia patients regard an ITI-success-rate of 10 
out of 16 patients, and an uneventful safety-profile in the expected frame. 
Although this overall result seems to be highly encouraging, the following points should be taken into 
account: 
Screening-data of the included patients reflect an overall patient-collective of good prognosis. Only 5 of 
16 patients were of high risk (historical inhibitor titers of >100 BU/ml). Of note, all of them failed ITI 
or reached only partial success. On the other hand, 6 subjects show baseline-inhibitor-titers <5 BU/ml 
(low risk). Out of these, 4 subjects had titers of ≤3 BU/ml, and even 2 subjects had titers of <1 BU/ml. 
The outcome of all of these was successful.

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/623021/2021

Of note, there is still ongoing discussion regarding spontaneous disappearance of inhibitors in low-risk 
patients and the need of any tolerization-therapy at all1. Further, for low-risk patients the adequate 
dosage of factor-concentrates for tolerization is still subject to debate2 – taking into account the high 
burden of twice daily infusion of – in this study chosen - very-high doses (200 IU/kg/d). Even the 
widely accepted gap between inhibitor detection and therapy for awaiting dropping titers is not 
generally agreed any more. Finally, upcoming non-factor-therapies have reached established places in 
treating inhibitor-patients3 4. 
Regarding study design, the following issues are challenging with respect to the outcome of the study: 
Elocta is described as an “extended half-life” FVIII-product, with a half-life of 20.9 hours (chromogenic 
assay) according to the SmPC. Definition of “ITI-success” for the primary endpoint is a half-life of 7 
hours. This value reflects 33% of 20.9 h - being far away from a “normal” – in the sense of a 
recovered - PK-behaviour. The uncontrolled study-design hampers the overall validity of the results, in 
addition.  
Regarding safety, the overall safety-profile is considered to be in-line with similar products and 
therapy. 
Of note, presentation of safety might be much more valuable if focused on the presentation of 
individual subjects and on the respective medicinal entity of safety concern – as the population covers 
16 subjects overall, only. Reflection of fragmented AEs shows an artificially “diluting” effect and does 
not help to understand the overall medicinal context. For example, for device- or access-related 
complications diverse codes are reflected (1 administration site extravasation, 1 catheter site 
extravasation, 1 catheter site hematoma, 1 catheter site swelling, 1 complication associated with 
device, 1 injection site hematoma, 1 injection site pain, 1 vascular access site infection, 4 vascular 
device infections, 1 device breakage, 1 device occlusion), likely to distract from the risks evolving from 
difficult venous access in the respective small-age patient-population in correlation to the used 
therapeutic regimen. At least 6 patients are affected by namely severe and threatening events e.g. 
infections (Serratia marcescens, Staph. Epid.) certainly not related with Elocta itself but eased by the 
regimen. 
However, no clear guidance on factor-tolerization-regimens is available with respect to certain risk-
factors or including non-factor-therapies, yet – precluding comparison of outcome-data.

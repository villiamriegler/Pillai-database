1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novo Nordisk A/S submitted on 4 December 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Fiasp, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) 
and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that insulin 
aspart was considered to be a known active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
As Fiasp shares the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substance and the same 
pharmaceutical form as NovoRapid authorised to the same MAH on 7 September 1999, the assessment of the 
current application includes an assessment of the applicant’s claim of significant differences in safety or efficacy 
versus NovoRapid due to difference in excipients. This is in line with the provision in the EC note on Handling of 
Duplicate Marketing Authorisation Applications Ares(2011)1044649, that  a medicinal product containing 
different excipients resulting in significant differences regarding safety or efficacy would fall outside the scope of 
Article 82(1) of Reg 726/2004. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Not applicable. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 22 September 2011, 14 May 2013 and 17 October 
2013. The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic hyperglycaemia defines diabetes, and glycaemic control is fundamental to diabetes management. 
Improvement in long-term glucose control has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence and progression of 
complications in people with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both fasting glycaemia and 
glycaemic excursions occurring after meals contribute to overall glycaemic burden, a major contributor to the 
microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. According to the 2011 International Diabetes 
Federation (IDF) guideline for management of post-meal glucose in diabetes, hyperglycaemia after meals is 
associated with an increased risk of micro- and macrovascular complications and should be addressed as part of 
the diabetes treatment regimen.  
2.1.2.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Control of glycaemic excursions after meals contributes to lowering the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level. 
As HbA1c decreases, the relative contribution of post-meal glucose control on HbA1c levels increases. Thus, in 
order to achieve recommended HbA1c targets (<7%), it is important to address post-meal hyperglycaemia in 
addition to fasting hyperglycaemia, and control of post-meal glucose excursions has received recognition as a 
therapeutic target for optimising glycaemic control in people with diabetes. 
2.1.3.  Management 
A variety of pharmacological therapies can be considered to target post-meal glycaemic control, including many 
novel agents such as incretin-based therapies and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Still, for individuals with T1DM and for 
many with T2DM, rapid-acting insulin before meals is the only, or the most appropriate, means of achieving 
post-meal and overall glucose control.  
Insulin, including mealtime insulin (i.e., short acting insulins and rapid-acting insulin analogues), is the most 
potent of all available therapies for diabetes. However, insulin is also one of the more challenging treatment 
options to utilise appropriately in clinical practice as it requires significant individualisation. Despite major 
advances in the development of rapid-acting insulin analogues that are absorbed more quickly than 
regular/soluble human insulin, currently available mealtime insulins are not able to completely control the rapid 
rise in glucose levels following a meal. An insulin product with a faster onset of action could potentially be of 
benefit via faster lowering of post-meal glucose concentrations, thereby improving postprandial glucose (PPG) 
control.  
Dosing before the meal in order to maximise the efficacy of the currently available rapid-acting insulin analogues 
is not always the most optimal time of dosing as seen from the patient’s perspective. Many patients with 
diabetes fear insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and since a delay in actual meal consumption or an unexpected 
change in meal size or composition may result in hypoglycaemia if insulin has already been injected pre-meal, 
patients might wait until they have eaten before injecting so they know exactly what and how much they have 
eaten. A more rapidly absorbed insulin would be likely to offer increased convenience and less concern about 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 8/132 
  
  
 
 
hypoglycaemia for individuals with diabetes by allowing injection at the start of a meal and with the possibility 
to inject post-meal if necessary, without jeopardising overall glycaemic control. Importantly, mealtime insulin 
with an earlier glucose-lowering effect, may also offer particular advantages to patients treated with continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by external pump, as reduced lag-time between the s.c. insulin infusion 
and the glucose-lowering effect should enable better adjustment of bolus and basal rates according to individual 
need and lead to improved glycaemic control. 
About the product 
Fiasp is insulin aspart in a new formulation. Insulin aspart, with the global trade name NovoRapid, has been on 
the market worldwide for more than a decade for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Compared to NovoRapid, 
Fiasp contains two additional excipients: nicotinamide (also known as niacinamide or vitamin B3) and L-arginine 
hydrochloride (an amino acid). The addition of nicotinamide is intended to result in a faster initial absorption of 
insulin aspart following subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The addition of L-arginine hydrochloride should support 
stabilisation of the Fiasp formulation. The insulin aspart molecule in Fiasp and NovoRapid is identical and 
therefore, once systemically absorbed, it has the same biological action at the insulin receptor as that of 
NovoRapid.  
Fiasp is intended to be used for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) both for 
basal-bolus therapy in combination with intermediate- or long-acting basal insulin (± oral antidiabetic drugs; 
OADs), and for CSII by external pump, where both basal and bolus requirements can be covered by Fiasp. Fiasp 
can be injected at the start of a meal or postmeal (within 20 minutes after starting a meal). Moreover, Fiasp can 
also be delivered intravenously by health care professionals when the clinical situation requires this route of 
administration. 
The indication sought is: “Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults”. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a centralised procedure application submitted under Article 8(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, known active substance. 
The clinical development programme includes three therapeutic confirmatory trials evaluating efficacy and 
safety of Fiasp in subjects with T1DM and T2DM and two CSII (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) trials. 
In addition, nine clinical pharmacology trials evaluating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties 
of Fiasp in various settings have been performed. 
More than 2500 subjects with T1DM or T2DM were included in the clinical development programme overall, 
including 2068 randomised subjects in the 3 therapeutic confirmatory trials, 80 randomised subjects in the CSII 
trials as well as 395 randomised subjects in the clinical pharmacology trials.

PDCO were involved. 
The key topics of the 2011 SA concerned: 
• 
• 
• 
adequacy of non-clinical data to support safety of new excipients (L-arginine hydrochloride, 
nicotinamide and trometamol) 
adequacy of clinical pharmacology investigations and  phase 3 non inferiority (NI) studies 
clinical endpoints to support post-prandial dosing regimen 
•  Antibody measurements and immunogenicity data   
• 
• 
Inclusion of  elderly (age ≥ 65 years) AND very elderly (age≥ 75 years) in the therapeutic confirmatory 
studies 
compatibility of Fiasp dosage administration to different insulin infusion pumps  
The 2013 SA focused mainly on the paediatric development; non-clinical data for L-arginine and nicotinamide as 
excipients and monitoring of formation of the arginine-insulin impurity. 
The advices given have in all essential parts been followed. 
The development program is in general well in line with current guidelines, including the EMA guidance 
(“Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes 
mellitus”, CHMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1).

The insulin aspart drug substance manufacturing process includes fermentation of yeast cells and recovery of 
insulin aspart precursor. The purification consists of the conversion of insulin aspart precursor followed by 
several purification steps to reach insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is stored at long term storage conditions. 
Overall the control of source and starting materials is considered adequate. The construction of the expression 
plasmid, the source and history of S. cerevisiae strain and the generation of the S. cerevisiae strain producing 
insulin aspart precursor is described in sufficient detail. Description of preparation and testing of Master Cell 
Bank, Working Cell Bank and end of production cells are provided. 
In general the fermentation, recovery, purification and storage have been described in sufficient details and are 
controlled by appropriate in-process controls and acceptance criteria of intermediate products. 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been submitted. 
Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications 
(including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials have been presented. No human or animal derived 
materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process. No animal derived starting materials are used 
in the manufacture of Insulin Aspart, however, one raw material is used, for which animal derived raw materials 
were used for manufacture. Acceptable documents have been provided. 
Control of critical steps 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout the 
insulin aspart active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been provided on 
the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with regards to 
critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process controls.  
Process validation 
Process validation of the manufacturing process for the fermentation, recovery and purification of insulin aspart 
was successfully carried out. 
Consistency in production has been shown on full scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the 
operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process controls are fulfilled demonstrating 
that the purification process consistently produces insulin aspart active substance of reproducible quality that 
complies with the predetermined specifications and in-process acceptance criteria.  
Characterisation 
Insulin aspart active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physico-chemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of insulin aspart. The 
analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure.  
The insulin aspart active substance is tested by a range of physicochemical tests (identity, purity, assay and 
microbial content) to assure consistency in the production of the active substance. 
All tests listed in the specification are specified in the Ph.Eur monograph for insulin aspart except for one 
method, which has been sufficiently described and validated. 
The results from the all insulin aspart active substance batches  used in the production of Fiasp finished product 
batches have been presented and meet the acceptance criteria according to the active substance specification.  
This shows that the insulin aspart manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing insulin aspart to 
the required quality.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Fiasp at a 100U/ml is produced at Novo Nordisk A/S, Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsværd, Denmark  
Fiasp finished product is a clear solution of insulin aspart and is prepared by mixing an acidic insulin solution with 
a slightly alkaline excipients solution. The pH of the finished product is approx. 7.1 
Fiasp is intended for subcutaneous injections and must be sterile.  
The finished product formulation of Fiasp tested in phase 3 clinical trials is identical to the formulation of the 
product to be marketed. The manufacturing process of Fiasp of products for the clinical trials is identical to the 
manufacturing process for the product to be marketed. 
The robustness of the final manufacturing process has been verified during process justification and the 
reproducibility has been demonstrated by manufacture of consecutive process performance qualification 
batches in 3 ml cartridges and 10 ml vials. The available data confirms the comparability between the process 
used to manufacture clinical phase material and the commercial process . 
the proposed specifications are considered clinically qualified, and therefore accepted. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference material 
The same reference material as described under active substance is used.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for vials, cartridges and pen-injectors is 30 months at 2°C - 8°C (in a refrigerator). The 
proposed in-use shelf life for vials, cartridges and pen-injectors is 28 days below 30°C. The cap on the pen 
should be kept on to protect from light. 
Stability studies were performed in 3 mL cartridges and 10 mL vials. The containers used in the stability studies 
were identical to the ones intended for the market active substance manufactured at production scale. 
All results comply with the proposed finished product shelf life specifications. Minor changes are observed for 
some well known impurities however these are not considered to impact the quality, safety and efficacy of the 
final product. 
In-use stability studies have been performed for primary stability batches of both cartridges and vials at 30°C ± 
2°C for 28 days.  
In-use stability studies have been performed for primary stability batches, at 37°C ± 2°C for 9 days for pump 
in-use  
The preservative efficacy of the finished product in the pump reservoir was evaluated using a modified Ph. Eur. 
Preservative Efficacy Test at conditions relevant for pump in-use. Finished product with levels of phenol and 
metacresol corresponding to the levels observed in the reservoir during the pump in-use studies was challenged 
with relevant microorganisms. The count of colony forming units of microbial test organisms fulfilled the 
acceptance criteria given in the Ph. Eur. (criteria B). 
The compositions of Fiasp in 10 ml vial and 3 ml cartridge are identical. The available real-time stability data for 
finished product in 10 ml vial support a comparable stability profile with similar trends and similar levels as the 
available real-time stability data for 3 ml cartridge. The stability results from cartridges are comparable to the 
results for the vials. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf life and storage conditions are acceptable as stated in the SmPC. 
The shelf-life for vials, cartridges and pen-injectors is 30 months at 2°C - 8°C (in a refrigerator). The in-use shelf 
life for vials, cartridges and pen-injectors is 28 days below 30°C. The cap on the pen should be kept on to protect 
from light. 
The applicant is requested to submit any new data from the ongoing stability studies and report any data on 
out-of-specification or out-of-trend to the EMA.

During the manufacturing process no primary animal derived raw material and only two secondary animal 
derived raw materials are used . The animal derived raw materials have been evaluated with regard to TSE and 
virus safety based on the source of the materials as well as on their production processes. 
Insulin aspart is concluded to be safe with regard to both virus and TSE agents. 
Bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma 
Insulin aspart is tested for bacteria and fungi during fermentation when infection control is performed as 
in-process test at each step (fernbach flask, seed fermenter and main fermenter). No growth of foreign 
organisms is accepted. 
The active substance is tested at release for total viable count by plate count (USP, Ph. Eur.) and bacterial 
endotoxins by Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (Ph. Eur. method D).  
GMO 
The finished product Fiasp does not contain a genetically modified organism, therefore this section is not 
applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
No major objections have been identified during the procedure. A limited number of other concerns on finished 
product have been identified which could be satisfactorily resolved by the Applicant during the procedure. No 
recommendations for future quality development have been identified.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The nonclinical pharmacology studies conducted for insulin aspart as part of development of NovoRapid 
demonstrated, in both in vivo and in vitro studies, that insulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely 
resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrated that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of 
insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin. No separate pharmacology studies have been conducted with 
Fiasp, but plasma glucose was measured as part of a PK/PD study in pigs and compared to NovoRapid. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with Fiaspor NovoRapid/NovoLog; this was 
accepted by the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A comprehensive set of safety pharmacology studies have been conducted for insulin aspart as part of 
development of NovoRapid/NovoLog including assessment of the nervous system, the cardiovascular and 
respiratory system as well as the gastrointestinal and urinary system. Effects were comparable to those 
produced by the same dose of human insulin. No safety pharmacology studies have been performed with Fiasp 
since it is insulin aspart in a new formulation. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were investigated for insulin aspart with hexobarbital and ethanol in 
the development of NovoRapid/NovoLog. No important interaction was seen with with hexobarbital and ethanol. 
No studies have been performed with Fiasp since it is insulin aspart in a new formulation; this was acceptable to 
the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
After absorption, the active substance insulin aspart behaves in the same way as with NovoRapid, and the 
pharmacokinetics program provided with this product covers most important aspects.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles after subcutaneous (s.c.) dosing of insulin aspart 
were studied in pigs using faster-acting insulin aspart (Fiasp) compared to NovoRapid.  
Early absorption of insulin aspart was statistically significantly increased for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. 
Consistent with the faster absorption of insulin aspart, a more rapid decrease in plasma glucose was observed. 
The time difference is in the span of 5-10 minutes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 17/132 
  
  
 
The mechanism by which the increased early absorption is achieved for Fiasp has been investigated in vitro and 
in vivo. In vitro data demonstrated that nicotinamide impacts the self-association of insulin aspart, promoting a 
greater proportion of a more highly permeable monomeric form of insulin aspart. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A full nonclinical safety programme was conducted for insulin aspart and has been assessed for registration of 
NovoRapid. Findings were predominantly related to the pharmacological action of insulin or exaggerated 
pharmacology of insulin and no findings of toxicological concern were observed.  
For this application the following additional toxicology evaluation has been performed: 
• 
• 
• 
local tolerance studies in rats, rabbits and pigs 
safety assessment of L-arginine and nicotinamide by literature review 
safety assessment of impurities 
Local tolerance studies are discussed below.  
No safety issues have been identified for nicotinamide or L-arginine. The daily exposure after dosing in highly 
insulin-resistant patient is >10-fold / 100-fold lower than what is acceptable for normal intake from food and 
dietary supplements. 
A number of drug product impurities and leachables were identified. They were shown to be of no toxicological 
concern, either by demonstrating a high margin to a calculated PDE-value or by showing that levels are below 
the TTC of 1.5 μg/day. 
Single dose toxicity 
No specific studies have been conducted with Fiasp, as studies have been conducted with NovoRapid/NovoLog.  
Single subcutaneous and intravenous injections of insulin aspart were well tolerated by rodents (mice and rats) 
and dogs. Only few animals showed signs of hypoglycaemia even at very high doses given systemically. Acute 
deaths in mice were considered to be due to hypoglycaemia. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No specific studies have been conducted with Fiasp, as studies have been conducted with NovoRapid/NovoLog.  
Repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs with subcutaneous 
administration of up to 52 weeks duration. In the pivotal 52-week study in dogs, daily dose levels of 0.5, 1, and 
2 U/kg were given bid; another group of dogs was given 2 U/kg/day of HI. Despite careful management between 
food intake and treatment hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in high dose animals and the dose level was 
therefore reduced to 1 U/kg/day from week 29 onwards. No significant antibody titres were detected and the 
only toxicity findings observed were those related to hypoglycaemia.  
In the two 52-week studies performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (T12 and T13), deaths occurred especially in high 
dose animals in both HI and IAsp treated animals. The cause of deaths was considered to be the result from 
hypoglycaemia despite food access ad libitum. The primary pharmacological effect of IAsp, i.e. p-glucose 
depression, appeared to be maintained throughout the treatment periods of up to 52 weeks. Fasted p-glucose 
appeared to increase over time in a dose-related manner. Antibody determination revealed significant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 18/132 
  
  
immunological response against insulin aspart as well as HI (only in the 52-week studies). The antibodies 
detected did not appear to neutralise the primary effect of insulin aspart or HI. Other findings in the study T12 
were elevated p-triglyceride levels, increased incidence of focal seminiferous epithelial atrophy in high dose 
males, and increased incidence of subcutaneous masses in the mammary gland region.  
A statistical analysis (time-to-tumour method according to Peto et al.; incidental/non-incidental classification) of 
the data coming from both non-survivals and survivals revealed statistically significant increase in the incidence 
of all mammary gland tumours combined (fibroadenoma, adenoma and adenocarcinoma) and benign mammary 
tumours alone in insulin aspart female rats dosed 200 U/kg/day (~ 100-200 times maximum clinical dose) in 
comparison with that of the control group. There were no statistically significant differences when the incidence 
of mammary tumours in the 200 U/kg/day group was compared with that in the HI reference group (p=0.062). 
In the T13 study (non-GLP) in female Spraque-Dawley rats, no significant differences in incidence of mammary 
tumours were reported between the controls and rats treated with 200 U/kg/day of insulin aspart. There were 
no statistically significant differences when the incidence of mammary tumours in the high dose group was 
compared with that in the HI reference group (p=0.52). A Peto analysis on the combined incidence of mammary 
tumours in high dose animals of the two 52- week studies in Sprague-Dawley (T-12 and T-13) indicated that the 
tumourigenicity of insulin aspart was not different from human insulin (p=0.29).  
It was concluded that both HI and IAsp have the capability to produce mammary tumours in the 
Sprague-Dawley rat upon prolonged exposure at supraphysiological doses (approximately 100 times the human 
exposure). The relevance of results generated at such high doses/exposures as well as the ethics of conducting 
long-term studies at doses, which produce 50% mortality within one year, was questioned. Although the design 
of the 52-week studies with IAsp can be criticised, it was concluded that the results obtained in studies with a 
similar background incidence of benign and malignant mammary tumours did not indicate any significant or 
relevant difference in tumourigenic potential between insulin aspart and HI. The overall evidence from in vitro 
and in vivo data thus suggests that the mammary tumours observed are not relevant for the proposed 
therapeutic use of insulin aspart. 
Genotoxicity 
Studies have been conducted with NovoRapid/NovoLog. No specific studies have been conducted with Fiasp. The 
ability of insulin aspart to induce gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells and chromosomal aberrations 
in vitro and in vivo was investigated. Tests of primary DNA damage in vitro were also conducted. Insulin aspart 
showed no potential for mutagenicity or clastogenicity in the standard battery of genotoxicity tests in the 
presence and absence of rat liver S9 fraction. 
Carcinogenicity 
As stated in the ICH guideline S6, standard 2-year carcinogenicity bioassays are generally considered 
inappropriate for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals such as insulin aspart. The carcinogenic potential of 
insulin aspart (NovoRapid/NovoLog) was assessed based on two 52-week studies in rats. No specific studies 
have been performed with Fiasp. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No specific studies have been conducted with Fiasp. This is acceptable as studies have been conducted with 
NovoRapid/NovoLog, where toxicity to reproduction was investigated with conventional designs in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 19/132 
  
  
 
Sprague-Dawley rats and rabbits following subcutaneous administration. Reference groups of animals treated 
with HI were included in all the three separate studies. In rats, insulin aspart had no direct effect on fertility or 
embryo-foetal development. Findings observed were secondary to treatment-induced hypoglycaemia and were 
similar to those observed with HI. 
Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetic study was performed in the nonclinical development programme of Fiasp, and none were 
required by the CHMP. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies in rats, rabbit and minipigs demonstrated no concern for local effects. Of most 
importance, the comparative study in rats showed that no difference in local tolerance was seen when 
comparing insulin aspart with NovoRapid.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Insulin aspart is a protein consisting of amino acids derived from a biological system and therefore expected to 
be readily biodegradable. 
The use of faster-acting insulin aspart for treatment of diabetes is unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The active substance, insulin aspart, is the active substance of the approved product NovoRapid. It is agreed 
that the nonclinical assessment of the current application for FIASP can be supported by the studies performed 
with Novorapid to a major extent.  
For the current application, the Applicant has provided in addition data on PK-PD in pigs, demonstrating a more 
rapid absorption and glucose-lowering effect of faster-acting insulin aspart when compared to NovoRapid. The 
importance of this difference is discussed in the clinical section of the assessment report. 
Local tolerance studies in rats, rabbits and minipigs showed no concern for local tolerability with this product. 
Drug product related impurities and leachables have been addressed and shown to be of no toxicological 
concern. 
No safety issues have been identified for the excipients nicotinamide or L-arginine. The daily exposure after 
dosing in highly insulin-resistant patient is >10-fold / 100-fold lower than what is acceptable for normal intake 
from food and dietary supplements. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non clinical aspects have been sufficiently addressed.

Table 3 Summary of clinical pharmacology trials 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Faster-acting insulin aspart (Fiasp /Fiasp) is insulin aspart in a new formulation which contains two additional 
excipients compared to NovoRapid: addition of nicotinamide results in a faster initial absorption of insulin aspart 
following subcutaneous injection and addition of L-arginine hydrochloride supports the stabilisation in the Fiasp 
formulation. 
The insulin aspart molecule in Fiasp and NovoRapid is identical and therefore, once systemically absorbed, the 
pharmacokinetic characteristics are assumed to be similar as that of NovoRapid. The characterisation of 
absorption and bioavailability of Fiasp comparing different administration routes and administration sites are

expected to be studied. The absorption rate and serum exposure of Fiasp in comparison with NovoRapid is also 
expected to be studied.  
The clinical pharmacology programme included eight trials in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 
one trial in healthy subjects, all conducted with the final Fiasp formulation intended for the market .  
Free insulin aspart was quantified by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 
human serum sampled over a period of 12 hours following administration of a single dose of Fiasp or NovoRapid. 
Blood sampling time, sampling frequency and sampling method were standardised across the clinical 
pharmacology trials.  
In order to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of Fiasp and NovoRapid, the insulin aspart 
concentration-time profiles were characterised according to selected temporal components which describe the 
onset of exposure, early exposure, the late (tail) exposure and the total exposure and maximum concentration 
of insulin aspart (Table 9). 
In addition to the reported pharmacokinetic results of all individual studies a pooled pharmacokinetic analyses 
was performed aimed at estimating one set of PK parameters corresponding to the dose (0.2 U/kg) administered 
to all subjects across trials and included all trials (3887, 3888, 3889, 3891, 3921, 3978) where white adult T1DM 
patients (18 to 64 years) were included and received a dose of 0.2 U/kg of Fiasp or NovoRapid administered in 
the abdomen. 
Table 4 Overview of endpoints used to describe pharmacokinetic properties 
In the therapeutic confirmatory trial 3852, pharmacokinetic samples were taken at 1 and 2 hours after the start 
of a standardised meal. A linear regression model was used for prediction of AUC0-12. 
Absorption  
Study 3949 was conducted to evaluate the systemic extent of exposure of insulin aspart after administration of 
Fiasp in different injection regions and via different routes of administration. Fiasp was administered as a single 
dose subcutaneously (0.2 U/kg) in the abdomen, deltoid and thigh region, intramuscularly (0.2 U/kg) in the 
thigh, and intravenously (0.02 U/kg), on five different dosing visits in healthy subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 24/132 
  
  
 
The absolute bioavailability of insulin aspart was approximately 80% after subcutaneous administration of Fiasp 
in the abdomen, deltoid and thigh and approximately 60 % after intramuscular injection. 
Total exposure (AUCIAsp, 0-12h) was comparable for Fiasp administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, the 
deltoid and the thigh (Figure 4). Maximum insulin aspart concentration (Cmax,IAsp) was approximately 30 % lower 
following subcutaneous injection in the thigh compared to the abdomen. 
Also the early insulin exposure (AUC IAsp,0-1h and AUCIAsp,0-2h) was lower following subcutaneous injection in the 
thigh compared to the abdomen and the deltoid region. 
Onset of exposure was assessed using the endpoints: onset of appearance, time to 50% Cmax,IAsp and t max,IAsp. 
Median onset of appearance was around 3 minutes and median t max,IAsp was 50.0-57.5 minutes for Fiasp across 
the abdomen, deltoid and the thigh regions.

Pooled pharmacokinetic analysis and individual trial results of Studies 3887, 3888, 3889, 3891, 
3921 and 3978.  
The pooled pharmacokinetic analysis included all six trials in which White adult subjects (18 to 64 years) with 
T1DM were included and received a single-dose of 0.2 U/kg of Fiasp or NovoRapid administered in the abdomen.  
The total insulin exposure (AUCIAsp, 0-12hours) and the maximum insulin concentration (Cmax,IAsp) were comparable 
between Fiasp and NovoRapid, both in the individual trials and in the pooled analysis (Figure 5).

(0.2 U/kg, trials 3887, 3888, 3889, 3891, 3921 and 3978) 
A consistent pattern was seen across all trials, with Fiasp resulting in a faster onset of appearance and earlier 
time to 50% Cmax,IAsp  and t max,IAsp  than NovoRapid (Figure 6). In the PK pool (trials 3887, 3888, 3889, 3891, 
3921 and 3978), the mean onset of appearance was twice as fast with Fiasp (4.1 minutes) as with NovoRapid 
(8.9 minutes) and the time to 50% Cmax,IAsp was approximately 9.5 minutes earlier with Fiasp compared to 
NovoRapid. 
Time to maximum insulin concentration (t max) was between 54.2 and 67.9 minutes in the individual trials with 
Fiasp and between 59.1 and 75.0 in the individual trials with NovoRapid. In the PK pool, tmax,IAsp was 62.4 
minutes with Fiasp and 69.8 minutes with NovoRapid and the difference of 7.3 minutes was statistically 
significant.

3978). 
Early insulin exposure has also been evaluated and the partial AUCs covering the first 90 minutes were 
consistently statistically significantly larger with Fiasp than NovoRapid in the individual trials (Figure 7). The 
largest differences were seen during the first 15 minutes, where the ratio ranged from 2.51 to 5.66. A similar 
pattern was seen in the PK pool where the difference was also statistically significant for the first two hours 
(AUCIAsp, 0-2hour). The estimated treatment ratio for AUCIAsp, 0-30min was between 1.67 and 2.47 in the individual 
trials, and was 2.01 in the PK pool, showing that twice as much insulin was available during the first 30 minutes

Figure 5 Mean treatment ratios and 95%CI for insulin aspart exposure (AUCIAsp) in adults with 
T1DM in individual trials and in the pooled analysis (0.2 U/kg, trials 3887, 3888, 3889, 3891, 3921 
and 3978) 
Late insulin exposure and the duration of exposure was assessed using the estimated time taken for the serum 
insulin aspart concentration to fall to 50% of the maximum in the later part of the concentration-time curve 
(time to late 50% Cmax,IAsp) and the area under the later part of the insulin aspart concentration-time curve 
(AUCIAsp, 2-12 hours). The pooled analyses supported the left shift of the whole pharmacokinetic profile of Fiasp 
compared to that of NovoRapid, including the tail. The estimated time to late 50% Cmax,IAsp was approximately 
12 minutes shorter with Fiasp than with NovoRapid. Exposure during the later part of the pharmacokinetic 
profile (AUCIAsp, 2-12 hours) of Fiasp was approximately 11% lower than with NovoRapid. Thus, Fiasp has ~10%

more insulin exposure in the first two hours and ~10% less in the late part, leading to similar overall total 
exposure as NovoRapid. 
Study 3890 investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of Fiasp and NovoRapid when given as a bolus on top 
of a basal CSII by external pump in subjects with T1DM. The mean profiles for insulin aspart concentration after 
bolus administration of Fiasp and NovoRapid are shown in Figure 8. 
The total insulin aspart exposure (AUCIAsp, Total) was similar for faster-acting insulin aspart and NovoRapid and 
the maximum serum concentration was 11 % higher with Fiasp than NovoRapid. 
Early insulin exposure: All of the bolus-related partial AUCs measured during the first 2 hours after 
administration of the bolus dose were statistically significantly greater with faster-acting insulin aspart than with 
NovoRapid (Table 10). AUCIAsp, 0-30min with faster-acting insulin aspart treatment was approximately 3 times as 
great as AUCIAsp, 0-30min with NovoRapid treatment. 
Onset of insulin exposure: tmax was estimated to occur 31% earlier with faster-acting insulin aspart (56.6 
minutes after administration) than with NovoRapid (82.3 minutes after administration). The difference in time to 
maximum concentration was 26 minutes between Fiasp and NovoRapid in the CSII setting compared to 7 
minutes after subcutaneous injection in the pooled analysis.

In zinc-containing formulations of insulin aspart, the presence of nicotinamide gives rise to a slight increase in 
the trans-endothelial transport of insulin aspart. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of insulin aspart was 0.22 L/kg following an intravenous dose of 0.02 U/kg Fiasp.  
The in vitro plasma protein binding of insulin aspart was 2-10% in human plasma (n=4) determined at 
concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 10 nM. 
Elimination 
Clearance of insulin aspart was 1.0 L/h/kg and elimination half-life was 10 minutes following an intravenous 
dose of 0.02 U/kg Fiasp. The terminal half-life of insulin aspart was 57 minutes following subcutaneous 
administration of Fiasp. 
Insulin aspart is similar to human insulin and is rapidly and extensively degraded to smaller peptides and all 
metabolites formed are inactive 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Total exposure (AUCIAsp,0-12h) and maximum serum insulin aspart concentration (Cmax,IAsp) increased nearly dose 
proportional with increasing dose after single dose administration of 0.1 U/kg, 0.2 U/kg and 0.4 U/kg. 
The pharmacokinetic within subject variability was low for both Fiasp and NovoRapid. The between-subject 
(interindividual) variability was larger than the within-subject variability in study 3887. No statistically 
significant differences in between-subject variability were observed between Fiasp and NovoRapid.

Special populations 
The effect of renal and hepatic impairment is expected to be similar to what has been observed for NovoRapid 
earlier. The pharmacokinetic properties of IAsp have previously been shown not to be affected by renal 
impairment or hepatic impairment. The lack of new data with Fiasp is acceptable. 
The effect of gender, race/ethnicity and body weight was estimated using a linear mixed effects model using 
data from study 3852. For Fiasp, no differences in exposure was found between gender or between the racial 
and ethnic groups investigated. A lower early exposure was observed with larger BMI for both Fiasp and 
NovoRapid. The influence of BMI on the absorption was less pronounced for Fiasp leading to relatively higher 
initial exposure compared to NovoRapid. 
When comparing elderly and younger adults, the AUC0-12 and Cmax was higher in geriatric subjects compared to 
younger adult subjects (30 % and 28 %, respectively). 
When comparing children with adults, the AUC0-12 and Cmax was lower in children compared to adult subjects (41 
% and 9 %, respectively). When comparing adolescents with adults, the AUC0-12 was 22 % lower in adolescents 
compared to adult subjects and Cmax was similar between adolescents and adults. 
In general, any observed differences in the pharmacokinetic exposure between different special populations are 
not believed to have any clinical implications considering the product is individually titrated. 
The number of patients in the elderly age groups across the Fiasp clinical programme is shown in table 11 below.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Insulin is a large protein and no classic drug-drug interactions have been encountered between insulins and 
other marketed medications. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that co-administration with other drugs will interact 
with the principal enzymes of insulin aspart catabolism and thus cause a change in its elimination. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fiasp is insulin aspart in a new formulation with two additional excipients. The addition of nicotinamide results 
in a faster initial absorption of insulin aspart following subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The addition of L-arginine 
hydrochloride supports stabilisation of the Fiasp formulation.  
The active substance in Fiasp is insulin aspart, which is a rapid-acting analogue of human insulin where the 
amino acid proline has been replaced with aspartic acid in position B28. The insulin aspart molecule in Fiasp and 
NovoRapid is identical and therefore, once systemically absorbed, it has the same biological action at the insulin 
receptor as that of NovoRapid.  
The primary activity of Fiasp is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin aspart, the 
active ingredient in Fiasp, regulate glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose by 
stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose 
production. Insulin also inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, insulin aspart 
behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of 
binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme included eight trials in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 
one trial in healthy subjects (Table 8). In addition to the nine clinical pharmacology trials, the therapeutic 
exploratory CSII trial 3930 included pharmacodynamic analyses during a standardised meal test. 
Pharmacodynamic analyses were also included in the therapeutic confirmatory trial 3852. These data are 
discussed in the efficacy part of this report. 
Pharmacodynamic endpoints 
In order to describe the pharmacodynamic properties of single dosing with Fiasp during the euglycaemic clamp, 
the pharmacodynamic profiles were characterised according to selected temporal components which describe 
the onset, early, late and total and maximum glucose-lowering effect (Table 12).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 32/132 
  
  
 
 
For the CSII trial 3890 all endpoints were based on the glucose infusion rate (GIR) adjusted for baseline. For this 
trial the endpoint AUCGIR,2-12h was not analysed due to the confounding of effects from the underlying basal 
insulin infusions. 
Table 7 Overview of endpoints used to described pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacodynamic pooled analysis 
The overall design of the trials in the Fiasp clinical pharmacology programme was standardised in order to allow 
for comparison across studies and to allow for a pooled analysis of the results. 
The pooled pharmacodynamic analyses aimed at estimating one set of PD parameters corresponding to the dose 
(0.2 U/kg) administered to all subjects across trials and included all trials where White adult T1DM patients (18 
to 64 years) were included and received a dose of 0.2 U/kg of Fiasp or NovoRapid administered in the abdomen 
(Figure 9).

Pharmacodynamic profiles 
In each of the three individual trials where the glucose infusion rate (GIR) was collected, and in the pooled 
analysis, the GIR profile of Fiasp shows a similar left shift compared to that of NovoRapid (Figure 10).

3887, 3891 and 3978) 
Onset of glucose-lowering effect 
The onset of the glucose-lowering effect was assessed using three endpoints (see Table 12). 
A consistent pattern was seen across the trials, with Fiasp resulting in a faster onset of glucose-lowering effect 
and an earlier time to 50% GIRmax and tGIRmax than NovoRapid. The onset of action was between 2.6 and 8.7 
minutes earlier with Fiasp and time to 50%GIRmax was between 7.8 and 10.3 minutes shorter with Fiasp than 
with NovoRapid (Figure 11). 
In the pooled analysis, the estimated onset of action was approximately 5 minutes faster for Fiasp than for 
NovoRapid. Time to 50% Cmax was approximately 9.5 minutes earlier and tGIRmax was approximately 10.5 
minutes earlier, with Fiasp than with NovoRapid (Figure 11).

T1DM in individual trials and in the pooled analysis (0.2 U/kg, trials 3887, 3891 and 3978) 
Early glucose-lowering effect 
Analysis of the early part of the area under the GIR profile shows that there is a consistent left shift of the 
glucose-lowering effect with Fiasp both in the individual trials and in the pooled analysis (Figure 12) with the 
largest difference seen during the first 30 minutes. Estimates of AUCGIR, 0-30 min were between 48% and 109% 
larger with Fiasp than with NovoRapid. 
In the pooled analysis, all partial AUCs covering the first 2 hours were statistically significantly larger with Fiasp. 
The area under the GIR curve was 74% larger during the first 30 minutes (AUC GIR, 0-30 min) with Fiasp than with 
NovoRapid (Figure 12).

Duration of glucose-lowering effect and late glucose-lowering effect 
The duration of the glucose-lowering effect and late glucose-lowering effect was assessed using two endpoints 
(see Table 12). The estimated time to late 50%GIR max and AUCGIR, 2-12 h were both consistently smaller with 
Fiasp compared to NovoRapid in each of the individual trials (Table 13). 
In the pooled analysis, the estimated time to late 50% GIRmax occurred approximately 14 minutes earlier with 
Fiasp than with NovoRapid (Table 13). The area under the later part of the GIR curve (AUCGIR, 2-12 h) was 10% 
smaller with Fiasp. Thus duration of action was shorter and the late glucose-lowering effect was smaller with 
Fiasp compared to NovoRapid.

Number of subjects: For trial 3887 and the pooled analysis, the number of subjects should be read as the 
number of profiles contributing to the analysis as subjects in trial 3887 received more than one dose at 0.2 U/kg 
Total glucose-lowering effect and maximum glucose-lowering effect 
The total (AUCGIR, 0-12h) and maximum (GIRmax) glucose-lowering effect were comparable between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid, both in the individual trials and in the pooled analysis, supporting that 1 unit of Fiasp results in 
equivalent glucose-lowering effect as 1 unit of NovoRapid. 
Across dose levels 
In trial 3887, the estimated onset of action was 5.0−5.8 minutes faster, and time to 50% of GIRmax was 
8.8−11.8 minutes earlier, with Fiasp than NovoRapid across the 3 dose levels (0.1, 0. 2 and 0.4 U/kg). Time to 
GIRmax was 8−22% shorter with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid across the 3 dose levels. The estimated mean 
time to GIRmax was 10.0 to 29.7 minutes shorter compared to NovoRapid across the 3 dose levels. 
The early glucose-lowering effect was statistically significantly larger with Fiasp than with NovoRapid across all 
three dose levels, except for AUCGIR,0-30min and AUCGIR,0-2h for the 0.1 U/kg dose level.  
The left shift of the later part glucose infusion rate profile of Fiasp seen in the individual trials and pooled analysis 
was maintained across the three dose levels. There was a trend for a shorter time to late 50%GIRmax across dose 
levels which was statistically significant at the 0.2 U/kg and 0.4 U/kg dose. AUCGIR, 2-12 hours was between 10% 
and 13 % smaller with Fiasp than with NovoRapid across dose levels. 
The total (AUCGIR, 0-12h) and maximum (GIRmax) glucose-lowering effect were comparable between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid across the three dose levels as was also seen in the individual trials and pooled analysis. 
Pharmacodynamic treatment differences during a meal test 
During a standardised meal test in the clinical pharmacology trials and in the therapeutic exploratory CSII trial 
3930, the average postprandial plasma glucose increment during time 0-t (t=1, 2 or 6 hours) and the plasma 
glucose concentrations at 1 and 2 hours after the start of meal were used to describe the early and total effect 
of Fiasp. The therapeutic trial 3852 did also include pharmacodynamic data during a meal test. These data are 
presented in the efficacy section of this report.

Mealtime dosing 
Clinical pharmacology trials 
Trials 3889 and 3888 compared the pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp and NovoRapid administered as a 
single subcutaneous injection (0.2 U/kg) immediately before a standardised meal in adult subjects with T1DM.   
In trial 3889, plasma glucose parameters were not statistically significantly different between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid. The estimated mean PPG increment over 2 hours following administration (ΔPG av,0-2h) was 3.55 
mmol/L for Fiasp and 3.74 mmol/L for NovoRapid and the estimated treatment ratio was 0.95 [0.81; 1.11]95% 
CI ]. ΔPGav,0-6h was not statistically significantly different (treatment ratio 0.98 [0.77; 1.26]95% CI).  
In trial 3888, the estimated mean PPG increment over 2 hours (ΔPGav,0-2h) with Fiasp in adults was 2.36 mmol/L 
with Fiasp and 2.93 mmol/L with NovoRapid . The estimated treatment difference between Fiasp and NovoRapid 
for ΔPGav,0-2h was not statistically significantly different (-0.57 mmol/L [-1.83;0.69]95% CI). The treatment 
difference (Fiasp – NovoRapid) in mean PPG increment over 1 hour (ΔPGav,0-1h) (-0.31mmol/L [-1.48;0.86]95% 
CI) was smaller than at 2 hours.  
Therapeutic exploratory trial 
Similar improvement with respect to glycaemic control was observed for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid during a 
meal test in the therapeutic exploratory CSII trial 3930. A statistically significantly greater glucose-lowering 
effect was demonstrated in post prandial glucose with Fiasp as compared to NovoRapid during the first 2 hours 
of a standardised meal test. The estimated mean PPG increment over the first 2 hours after the meal (ΔPGav,0-2h) 
was -0.99 mmol/L [-1.95; -0.03] 95%CI smaller with Fiasp (3.03 mmol/L) than with NovoRapid (4.02 mmol/L). 
Similarly, the mean PPG increment over the first hour after the meal (ΔPGav,0-1h) was -0.50 [-1.07; 0.07]95%CI 
lower with Fiasp than with NovoRapid. 
Post-meal dosing 
In trial 3921, Fiasp (0.2 U/kg) administered 20 minutes post-meal resulted in a smaller glucose-lowering effect 
(PGav,0-6h was 13% higher; treatment ratio 1.13 [1.06; 1.21]90% CI) compared to NovoRapid administered 
immediately before the meal.

Onset of glucose-lowering effect and early glucose-lowering effect 
In a CSII setting, Fiasp resulted in a faster onset of glucose-lowering effect (Table 14) and a greater early 
glucose-lowering effect ) than NovoRapid. The difference in time to maximum glucose-lowering effect was 18.7 
minutes between Fiasp and NovoRapid  in the CSII setting compared to 10.5 minutes after subcutaneous 
injection (pooled analysis) (Table 14).

Duration of glucose-lowering effect and late glucose-lowering effect 
The larger left shift in onset of action and early glucose-lowering effect with Fiasp seen in a CSII setting was 
reflected in a time to late 50% GIRmax that was 24 minutes earlier with Fiasp than with NovoRapid in a CSII 
setting, compared to a treatment difference 14 minutes for single dose subcutaneous injection (Table 16). 
AUCGIR, 2-12 h was similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid in a CSII setting.

Total glucose-lowering effect and maximum glucose-lowering effect 
Total (AUCGIR, 0-12h) and maximum (GIRmax) glucose-lowering effect were both comparable between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid in a CSII setting. 
Injection regions and routes of administration 
In trial 3949, the glucose-lowering effect was assessed after administration of Fiasp using different injection 
regions and routes of administration. Fiasp was administered as a single dose (0.2 U/kg) subcutaneously in the 
abdomen, deltoid and thigh and intramuscularly in the thigh in healthy subjects. 
The mean glucose infusion rate profiles showed that the glucose-lowering effect was within the same range 
following Fiasp administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, the deltoid and the thigh (Figure 14). Descriptive 
statistics for AUCGIR,0-12h and GIRmax supported these findings even though GIR max was higher after abdominal 
dosing.

Intramuscular versus subcutaneous administration 
The mean glucose infusion rate in trial 3949 showed that the glucose-lowering effect of Fiasp was similar 
following intramuscular administration of Fiasp compared to subcutaneous administration in the thigh. 
Descriptive statistics for AUCGIR,0-12h, GIRmax and tGIRmax supported these finding. 
Intrinsic factors 
Body mass index 
A greater early glucose-lowering effect was observed during the first 2 hours after administration with Fiasp 
compared to NovoRapid across the range of BMI. Total (AUCGIR, 0-12 hours) and maximum (GIRmax) 
glucose-lowering effect were comparable between Fiasp and NovoRapid at all three BMI levels. As expected, the 
early, total and maximum glucose-lowering effect decreased with increasing BMI for both Fiasp and NovoRapid 
in accordance with the well-known higher insulin resistance with increasing BMI. 
Age 
Children and adolescents 
In trial 3888, Fiasp had a larger glucose-lowering effect than NovoRapid during a meal test in children. In 
adolescents, a larger glucose-lowering effect for Fiasp was not demonstrated during a meal test, despite a 
greater early insulin exposure. In adults, the glucose-lowering effect tended to be larger for Fiasp than for 
NovoRapid during a meal test. The treatment effect did not differ significantly between age groups.  
For Fiasp, the mean PPG increment and the mean PG levels 1 and 2 hours post dosing during the meal test were 
similar between children and adults, and between adolescents and adults. A test for interaction between age 
group and treatment showed that the age group effect did not differ significantly between the treatments for the 
pharmacodynamic endpoints.

Elderly subjects with T1DM 
The onset of action in elderly subjects was approximately 10 minutes faster (estimated difference Fiasp - 
NovoRapid: -10.17 [-15.29;-5.06]95% CI) with Fiasp than with NovoRapid, and time to 50% GIRmax was 
approximately 6 minutes faster (-5.58 [-8.99;-2.17]95% CI) with Fiasp than for NovoRapid (Trial 3891). The early 
glucose-lowering effect was also larger with Fiasp than NovoRapid. The total (AUCGIR,0−12h) and maximum 
(GIRmax) glucose-lowering effect were both similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid  in elderly subjects. 
The total and maximum glucose-lowering effect of Fiasp was similar for elderly and younger adult subjects. The 
same was observed for NovoRapid and no statistically significant age-by-treatment interaction was observed 
(Trial 3891). 
Sex 
Both female and male adult subjects with T1DM had a greater early glucose-lowering effect with Fiasp compared 
to NovoRapid during the first 2 hours following administration and the treatment differences appeared 
comparable for males and females. Furthermore, the total and maximum glucose-lowering effects were both 
similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid for both sexes. Early, maximum and total glucose-lowering effect appeared 
overall to be similar in females and males for both Fiasp and NovoRapid. 
Anti-insulin aspart antibodies 
Across all quartiles of total anti-insulin aspart antibodies a greater early glucose-lowering effect was observed 
with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid during the first hour following administration. The size of the greater early 
glucose-lowering effect appeared to be comparable across the three total anti-insulin aspart antibody quartiles. 
Both total and maximum glucose-lowering effects were comparable for Fiasp and NovoRapid across all total 
anti-insulin aspart antibody quartiles. 
Total glucose-lowering effect did not appear to be affected by the level of total anti-insulin aspart antibodies for 
either Fiasp or NovoRapid. However, GIRmax was slightly lower for the high total anti-insulin aspart antibody 
percentiles compared to the 25th percentile and this difference was significant for NovoRapid. 
Pharmacodynamic within-subject variability 
In trial 3887, the pharmacodynamic within-subject day-to-day variability of a single dose of Fiasp was 
investigated. The pharmacodynamic within-subject variability was determined by the coefficient of variation 
(CV%) calculated based on 3 single doses (0.2 U/kg) of Fiasp or NovoRapid. 
The within-subject day-to-day variability in glucose-lowering-effect was low for Fiasp for early (AUCGIR, 0-1h, 
CV~26 %), total (AUCGIR, 0-12h, CV~18 %) and maximum glucose-lowering effect (GIRmax, CV ~19 %). The 
within-subject day-to-day variability in glucose-lowering effect for NovoRapid was similarly low. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Dose-response relationship 
In trial 3887, the pharmacodynamic dose-response relationship of Fiasp was investigated after single-dose 
administration of three clinically relevant doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg). The mean glucose-lowering effect 
increased with increasing dose (Figure 15).

Figure 13 Mean GIR profiles (0-8 hours) at three Fiasp dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg) in adults 
with T1DM in trial 3887 
The total glucose-lowering effect (AUCGIR, 0-12 hours) of the 0.2 U/kg dose was approximately twice as high 
(~110%) than that of the 0.1 U/kg dose. The glucose-lowering effect of the 0.4 U/kg dose was only ~70% larger 
than that of the 0.2 U/kg dose level. This indicates that some subjects were no longer on the linear part of the 
s-shaped dose-response curve and had approached the plateau of insulin action expected at the higher insulin 
dose of 0.4 U/kg. This is supported by the estimates of GIRmax for Fiasp which were 4.18, 7.12 and 9.98 
mg/(kg*min) for 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg, respectively. Analysis of dose-linearity, where a second order coefficient 
equal to 0 corresponds to dose linearity, indicated that the increases in AUCGIR,0-12h and GIRmax after 
administration of Fiasp were slightly less than linear. Similar results were observed for NovoRapid.  
Relationship between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp were characterised in a therapeutically relevant 
dose range (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg) in trial 3887. The added excipients of Fiasp resulted in a left shift in the 
pharmacokinetic properties of Fiasp compared to NovoRapid which translated into a faster onset of 
glucose-lowering effect. As expected, there was a correlation between total exposure (AUCIAsp,0-12h) and total 
glucose-lowering effect (AUCGIR,0-12h) within the investigated dose range of Fiasp in subjects with T1DM 
(R2=0.51). Correspondingly, GIRmax correlated with Cmax,IAsp (R2=0.46). This was supported by the observation 
that both AUCIAsp,0-12h and AUCGIR,0-12h increased approximately proportionally with increasing dose. 
The correlation between total exposure (AUCIAsp,0-12h) and total glucose-lowering effect (AUCGIR,0-12h) for Fiasp 
was comparable to that seen with NovoRapid. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
Japanese subjects with T1DM (trial 3918) 
The design of trial 3918 replicated that of trial 3978 which compared the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp and NovoRapid in White subjects. In general, the design and methodology 
used was comparable across the studies, including the clamp methodology.  
Assessment report

A faster onset of action (assessed using time to 50%GIRmax and tGIRmax) was seen with Fiasp than with 
NovoRapid in Japanese subjects, as was also observed in White subjects. The estimated time to 50% GIRmax for 
Fiasp in Japanese subjects was significantly earlier (by 10 minutes) than for NovoRapid. Moreover, tGIRmax in 
Japanese subjects was also significantly earlier for Fiasp than for NovoRapid. Early glucose-lowering effect was 
significantly greater for Fiasp than for NovoRapid in Japanese subjects with the largest difference occurring in 
the first 30 minutes, as was also seen in White subjects. 
The total glucose lowering effect (AUCGIR,0-12h) was slightly lower for Fiasp than for NovoRapid  in Japanese 
subjects whereas the maximum glucose-lowering effect (GIRmax) was similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid in both 
Japanese subjects and in White subjects. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In study 3949 comparing serum exposure of insulin aspart after administration of Fiasp in different injection 
regions and via different routes of administration in healthy volunteers, Cmax,IAsp was approximately 30 % lower 
following subcutaneous injection of Fiasp in the thigh compared to the abdomen in healthy subjects. Also the 
early exposure (AUCIAsp,0–1h, AUCIAsp,0–2h) was lower following subcutaneous injection in the thigh compared to 
the abdomen and the deltoid region. The total serum exposure (AUCIAsp,0–12h) of insulin aspart was however 
comparable following subcutaneous administration of Fiasp in all three injection sites. 
The results of the pooled pharmacokinetic analysis and individual trial results of studies 3887, 3888, 3889, 
3891, 3921 and 3978 indicated a left shift of the serum concentration-time curve for Fiasp with a higher early 
exposure following administration of Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. All individual pharmacokinetic parameters 
were not statistically significant in all individual studies (for example t max and AUCIAsp,0–2h) but the point 
estimates showed a faster absorption for Fiasp in all studies. In the pooled PK analysis, all pharmacokinetic 
parameters were statistically significant and showed a faster absorption of Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. The 
magnitude of the left shift of the serum concentration-time curve could be described in the parameters of early 
exposure and the AUC following the first 15 minutes was 3.8 times larger for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid, 
AUCIAsp,0–30min was 2 times larger, AUCIAsp,0–1h was 1.3 times larger, AUCIAsp,0-90min was 1.16 times larger and 
AUCIAsp,0–2h was 1.10 times larger for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. Another parameter describing the left shift 
of the concentration-time curve is the time to maximum serum concentration (tmax) which was observed 7 
minutes earlier following Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The active substance, insulin aspart, is well characterised with regards to the mechanism of action. No additional 
data has been provided which is acceptable. 
The clinical pharmacology program consists of 9 studies, designed to compare the pharmacodynamic properties 
of Fiasp and NovoRapid. Further to this, pharmacodynamic data was collected from the clinical trial and 3930 
(T1DM, CSII). Pharmacodynamic data was also collected in the confirmatory trial 3852, these data are discussed 
in the efficacy part of this report. The program was conducted in line with the EMA Guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1) and covers all important aspects.   
The choice of NovoRapid as comparator was adequate, as were the doses used. The use of the same dose of 0.2 
U/kg in all clinical pharmacology trials (where administration was by subcutaneous injection), allowed for 
comparison across trials as well as pooling of data from trials 3978, 3887 and 3891. As the design and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 44/132 
  
  
methodology used was comparable across the studies (e.g., dose per kg body weight, inclusion and exclusion 
criteria) and the clamp studies were standardised across studies, the pooling strategy is acceptable. 
Euglycaemic clamp studies 
In six trials (trials 3887, 3890, 3891, 3918, 3949 and 3978), the pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp were 
evaluated using a glucose clamp technique as recommended in the current EMA Guideline (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 
Rev. 1). Adequate measures were taken to minimise the effect of factors that could interfere with the results.   
In all three studies which were included in the pooled analysis (3978, 3887 and 3891), the point estimates for 
the endpoints describing the onset of glucose-lowering effect indicated a faster onset of action with Fiasp 
compared to NovoRapid. The findings were statistically significant not only in the pooled analysis but also in the 
individual studies with few exceptions, i.e. onset-of action in trial 3978 and tGIR max in trials 3891 and 3978. In 
the pooled analysis, the onset of appearance was observed 5 minutes earlier and time to 50% GIRmax was 9.5 
minutes earlier with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. Time to GIRmax occurred 10.5 minutes earlier with Fiasp than 
with NovoRapid. 
In all three studies, the point estimates for the endpoints describing the early glucose-lowering effect indicated 
an earlier effect with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid, as reflected by a greater treatment difference in AUCGIR, 0-30 
min (74 %) than in AUC for longer time-periods (AUCGIR, 0-1 h, AUCGIR, 0-90 min and AUCGIR, 0-2 h). The findings were 
statistically significantin the pooled analysis and in the individual studies with one exception, i.e. AUCGIR, 0-2 h in 
trial 3891. Thus, the early glucose-lowering effect was more pronounced with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid and 
the difference was statistically significant. 
The late glucose-lowering effect and duration of action, as reflected by time to late 50 % GIRmax and AUCGIR, 2-12 
h, indicated a lower late glucose-lowering effect and shorter duration of action with Fiasp compared to 
NovoRapid. In the individual studies, statistically significant effects were only observed in study 3887. However, 
consistent findings were seen across studies as reflected by statistically significant differences observed in the 
pooled analysis. In the pooled analysis, time to late 50 % GIRmax occurred about 14 minutes earlier and the late 
glucose-lowering effect was about 10 % lower with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. 
No differences were observed in the total and maximum glucose-lowering effect between Fiasp and NovoRapid. 
Comparable results were also observed across the doses investigated. 
The differences observed in the pharmacodynamic profiles between Fiasp for the 0.2 U/kg dose was maintained 
for the dose range investigated (0.1-0.4 U/kg). 
In the CSII setting a similar shift of the curve to the left for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid as in the single 
injection trials was observed. The onset of the glucose-lowering effect showed a greater difference between 
Fiasp and NovoRapid in the CSII setting than in single injection trials (time to 50 % GIRmax, -11.1 min vs -9.5 
min; tGIRmax, -18.7 min vs -10.5 min), in line with the pharmacokinetic observation of a faster onset of 
exposure. The duration of the glucose-lowering effect was shorter with Fiasp, whereas no difference in AUCGIR, 
2-12 h was observed. In spite of the more pronounced onset of action, the total glucose-lowering effect did not 
differ between treatments in the CSII setting. 
Low and comparable within-subject variation in the glucose-lowering effect was observed for both Fiasp and 
NovoRapid. 
A linear dose-response was observed in the dose range 0.1-0.2 U/kg, whereas this was not confirmed for the 0.4 
U/kg dose. The same pattern was observed for NovoRapid. Thus the 0.4 U/kg dose is on the top of the 
dose-response curve for both products. There was a good correlation between exposure and effect for Fiasp.

Meal test 
Standardised meal tests were performed in the pharmacological trials 3889 and 3888, in the clinical CSII trial 
3930 in order to investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp and NovoRapid in a clinically relevant but 
still standardised setting.  
Both in trial 3889 and 3888, a numerically lower increment in PPG during the first 2 hours was observed with 
Fiasp compared to NovoRapid after a standardised meal but the difference was not statistically significant. In the 
CSII trial 3930, the estimated mean PPG increment over the first 2 hours after the meal (ΔPGav,0-2h) was -0.99 
mmol/L [-1.95; -0.03]95% CI smaller with Fiasp (3.03 mmol/L) than with NovoRapid (4.02 mmol/L). The mean 
PPG increment over the first hour after the meal (ΔPGav,0-1h) was also lower with Fiasp than with NovoRapid, 
however not statistically significant. 
Post-meal dosing was investigated in the clinical pharmacological trial 3921. When compared to NovoRapid, the 
glucose lowering effect with Fiasp was statistically significantly smaller. 
Impact of site of injection and type of injection on the pharmacodynamic profile 
The pharmacodynamic profile after s.c. injection at different injection sites (abdomen, upper arm and thigh) was 
investigated. From the graphical presentation of data after injection of Fiasp at different sites it appears as if the 
onset of action is not affected by the injection site chosen. However, at 1 and 2 hours after the dose, the curves 
separate indicating a lower and longer duration of action after an injection in the thigh compared to injection in 
the abdomen. These differences appear to be of the same magnitude as those observed when comparing Fiasp 
with NovoRapid. The main objective of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Fiasp when 
administered at different sites. Information on the pharmacokinetic differences observed is included in section 
5.2 of the SmPC, and section 4.2 recommends administration in the abdominal wall and upper arm only. 
No difference in the time to onset of action or the maximum effect of Fiasp was observed when injected 
subcutaneously or intramuscularly. This is reassuring as accidental intramuscular injection may occur. 
Intrinsic factors 
The effect of intrinsic factors (BMI, age, sex and ethnicity) as well as the influence of anti-insulin antibodies on 
the pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp after subcutaneous injection was evaluated in comparison with 
NovoRapid. Furthemore, the pharmacodynamic properties of Fiasp were investigated in Japanese subjects. No 
clinically relevant effects of the intrinsic factors investigated were observed. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The total serum exposure (AUCIAsp,0–12h) and Cmax,IAsp were similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid, both in the 
individual trials and in the pooled pharmacokinetic analysis. The results for parameters reflecting the rate of 
exposure are consistent in all studies (including adults, children, elderly, Japanese, CSII setting) indicating a left 
shift of the serum concentration-time curve for Fiasp with a higher early exposure following administration of 
Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. 
The pharmacodynamic profile of Fiasp in relation to that of NovoRapid has been adequately characterised. The 
pharmacodynamic data show that Fiasp (given before a meal) has an earlier onset of action than NovoRapid, 
while the total glucose-lowering effect remains unchanged. This was also observed in the CSII setting. This 
difference in onset of action resulted in lower post-prandial glucose increments in meal tests. When Fiasp was 
given post-meal, this effect was no longer observed. As a lower and longer duration of action was observed when 
Assessment report

Fiasp was injected in the thigh, the SmPC only recommends injection in the abdominal wall or upper arm. The 
pharmacodynamic profile was not affected by intrinsic factors.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy evaluation of Fiasp (in the final formulation intended for the market) is based on three therapeutic 
confirmatory trials evaluating efficacy and safety of Fiasp in subjects with T1DM and T2DM. In addition, two CSII 
trials provide supportive data evaluating Fiasp for CSII by external pump. 
More than 2500 subjects with T1DM or T2DM were included in the clinical development programme overall, 
including 2068 randomised subjects in the 3 therapeutic confirmatory trials, 80 randomised subjects in the CSII 
trials as well as 395 randomised subjects in the clinical pharmacology trials. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
For dose-response studies, please refer to the Clinical pharmacology section of this report.  
Considering that the phase 3 trials were conducted with a treat-to-target principle, the frequent visits and close 
monitoring with careful insulin titration of FIASP and NovoRapid, it is considered acceptable to proceed directly 
from phase 1 to phase 3 trials. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Methods 
Trial 3852 (26+26 weeks basal-bolus trial in subjects with T1DM) 
This was a 26+26-week randomised (1:1:1), active-controlled, parallel-group, basal-bolus trial in 1143 subjects 
with T1DM on a pre-trial basal-bolus regimen for ≥12 months. The trial included a double-blind comparison of 
the efficacy and safety of mealtime Fiasp with mealtime NovoRapid, both administered 0-2 minutes prior to main 
meals. The trial also included a comparison of an open-label post-meal Fiasp arm (administered 20 minutes after 
start of the meal) with the mealtime NovoRapid arm. In all three treatment arms, the bolus insulin was given in 
combination with once or twice daily insulin detemir. After screening, subjects had their basal insulin switched 
to insulin detemir and their bolus insulin to NovoRapid, both on a unit-to-unit basis. During an 8 week run-in 
period, the basal insulin dose was then optimised using a treat-to-target approach. The primary and secondary 
confirmatory objectives were addressed based on results from the initial 26-week treatment period. 
Subjects in the double-blind mealtime Fiasp and mealtime NovoRapid arms continued into an additional 
26-week treatment period, primarily for further collection of safety information. The additional 26-week 
treatment period was ongoing at the time of the cut-off date for this application (10th March 2015).

subjects with T2DM on a pre-trial basal insulin + OAD regimen for ≥6 months. The trial compared the efficacy 
and safety of mealtime Fiasp with mealtime NovoRapid, both administered 0−2 minutes prior to main meals and 
both in combination with once-daily insulin glargine and metformin in a basal-bolus regimen. An 8-week run-in 
period was included at the start of which all OADs other than metformin were discontinued. During the run-in

Treatments 
Basal insulin titration during run-in and treatment period 
In trials 3852 and 3853 (the basal-bolus trials), the basal insulin was titrated by the investigator on a weekly 
basis in the 8-week run-in period using a treat-to-target approach with a protocol specified pre-breakfast SMPG 
glycaemic target of 4.0–5.0 mmol/L. From randomisation and onwards, bolus titration was the focus of both 
trials 3852 and 3853.  
In trial 4049, subjects continued on their once-daily basal insulin and metformin regimen at the same dose-level 
as before the trial. The basal insulin treatment was optimised using a treat-to-target approach, with a protocol 
specified pre-breakfast SMPG glycaemic target of 4.0–6.0 mmol/L. From randomisation and onwards, focus was 
placed on optimising the bolus insulin in the treatment arm with basal-bolus treatment.  
Bolus insulin during run-in and treatment period 
In trial 3852, in subjects with T1DM, subjects were switched from their pre-trial bolus insulin to mealtime 
NovoRapid at the start of the 8-week run-in period. NovoRapid was not to be titrated during the run-in period 
unless necessary for safety reasons. At randomisation, subjects were randomised to Fiasp (mealtime or 
post-meal) or NovoRapid for bolus insulin administration at each of the three main meals. Additional bolus doses 
were allowed if necessary. All subjects continued on the same bolus insulin dose (Fiasp or NovoRapid) after 
randomisation as at the end of the run-in period. The bolus dose was administered either 0–2 minutes before 
each main meal (mealtime dosing), which is in accordance with the approved label for NovoRapid, or 20 minutes 
after the start of the meal (post-meal dosing, Fiasp only). 
Subjects who were by the investigator considered adequately trained during the run-in period to do flexible 
bolus adjustments based on the carbohydrate content of their meals were able to continue doing so after 
randomisation. The bolus insulin was titrated to pre-prandial or bedtime SMPG glycaemic target of 4.0–6.0 
mmol/L at the subsequent meal or bedtime (for the dinner dose) in a treat-to-target fashion (Table 19). 
In trial 3853, subjects were randomised to the addition of bolus insulin treatment with Fiasp or NovoRapid taken 
0–2 minutes before each of the three main meals. Additional bolus doses were allowed if necessary. The bolus 
insulin start dose was 4 units at each main meal. Thereafter the bolus insulin dose was titrated daily to the 
prespecified pre-prandial or bedtime SMPG glycaemic target of 4.0–6.0 mmol/L at the subsequent meal or 
bedtime in a treat-to-target fashion (Table 19). 
In trial 4049, in the basal-bolus arm, Fiasp was initiated with a start bolus dose of 4 units taken 0−2 minutes 
before each of the three main meals. Thereafter the bolus insulin was titrated daily to the pre-prandial or 
bedtime SMPG glycaemic target of 4.0–6.0 mmol/L at the subsequent meal or bedtime in a treat-to-target 
fashion (Table 19). Additional bolus doses were allowed if necessary.

SMPG: self-measured plasma glucose 
In trial 3852, titration was done twice weekly based on SMPG values measured the previous 3-4 days (-1 unit if ≥1 
SMPGs below target; no change if 0−1 SMPG above target or no SMPGs below target; +1 unit if ≥2 SMPGs above target or no 
SMPGs below target). In trials 3853 and 4049, titration was done daily based on the corresponding SMPG value measured the 
previous day. 
Meal test 
Trials 3852 (T1DM) and 3853 (T2DM) included a standardised meal test in a controlled setting at baseline and 
week 26 for measurement of parameters of PPG over 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after meal ingestion.

events was not considered in the sample size calculations, although it was advised by the EMA that this variable 
needed to be part of the primary evaluation (scientific advice from 2011). This was suboptimal, and seems to be 
intentional. 
Study 4049 
The minimum randomised sample size required to meet the primary objective with at least 90% power is 218 
with an assumed SD of 1.2%. The expected difference between treatment used in the calculations were 0.53%. 
The assumptions are reasonable, the expected treatment difference is adjusted downwards to account for a less 
pronounced difference in withdrawn subjects compared to completers. 
Randomisation 
In study 3852 the randomisation was carried out in a 1:1:1 manner to the 3 treatments using the IV/WRS: 
•  Mealtime Fiasp and insulin detemir 
•  Mealtime NovoRapid and insulin detemir 
• 
Post meal Fiasp and insulin detemir. 
The randomisation was stratified based on the following 3 factors: 
•  Method used by the subject for adjusting the bolus insulin (principles of flexible dosing based on the 
meal carbohydrate content (carbohydrate counting) or using pre-defined bolus dosing algorithm) 
•  Current basal treatment regimen (once or twice daily dosing) 
•  Whether the subject participates in the CGM and frequently sampled meal test subgroup (yes or no). 
In study 3853 the randomisation was carried out in a 1:1 manner to two different treatments using the IV/WRS: 
•  Mealtime Fiasp in addition to insulin glargine and metformin 
•  Mealtime NovoRapid in addition to insulin glargine and metformin. 
In order to aim for an equal number of subjects for the two treatment groups in the CGM-subgroup the trial was 
stratified according to CGM-subgroup participation (yes/no). 
In study 4049 the randomisation is 1:1 and stratified to ensure an equal distribution of Subjects on the three 
types of once daily basal insulin in the two treatment arms. 
Blinding (masking) 
For studies 3852 and 3853 the initial 26-week treatment with mealtime Fiasp and NovoRapid was 
double-blinded.  Study 4049 was an open-label study, and this was considered reasonable. 
Statistical methods 
Trial 3852 and 3853 
The evaluation of efficacy was based on the full analysis set (FAS). For the sensitivity analyses, a per protocol 
analysis set was defined, as well as a completer analysis set and a sensitivity analysis set for 1 to 4 hour PPG 
endpoints.

The primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of randomised treatment, was analysed by 
similar methods in the two non-inferiority studies, using a mixed-effects model for repeated measurements 
(MMRM). The model included treatment, region and stratification as fixed effects, subject as random effect, 
HbA1c at baseline as covariate and interactions between all fixed effects and visit, and between the covariate 
and visit. In study 3852, stratification effect included eight strata, based on the combination of the three 
stratification variables. In study 3853, the stratification effect was only CGM. From the MMRM model, estimated 
treatment difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) was obtained. 
The null-hypothesis (H0) was that the mean treatment difference (Fiasp minus NovoRapid) for change in HbA1c 
at week 26 was greater than 0.4%. The null-hypothesis was to be rejected, and non-inferiority of Fiasp 
considered confirmed, if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean HbA1c 
treatment difference was below or equal to 0.4%. If non-inferiority was confirmed for the primary endpoint, the 
trials also compared treatment arms for a number of confirmatory secondary endpoints in a stepwise 
hierarchical (fixed sequence) procedure in order to control the family-wise type I error rate in the strong sense. 
This was based on a priority ordering of the null hypotheses, and testing them in this order using the two-sided 
95% confidence interval approach until an insignificant result appeared. The steps in the hierarchical testing 
procedure in study 3852 and study 3853 are presented in Figure 19, respectively. The rejection of the null 
hypothesis was only confirmed for the endpoints where all previous null-hypotheses had been rejected in favour 
of Fiasp.  
Figure 17 Testing hierarchy for the confirmatory statistical analyses: Trials 3852 and 3853 
The main purpose of the sensitivity analyses was to investigate the impact of missing data on the primary 
analysis. A series of sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plans, including re-run of 
the primary MMRM analysis based on the per protocol analysis set and the completer analysis set, an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation, and several multiple imputation

methods using a copy-reference approach. Also post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed, with multiple 
imputation method using jump-to-reference approach and tipping point analysis. 
Analysis methods of the confirmatory secondary endpoints are presented in Table 21.

Across trial analysis was prospectively planned for study 3852 and study 3853, in order to add statistical power 
and confirm the potential findings of the individual studies. Superiority of Fiasp treatment over NovoRapid was 
tested on 1-hour (the primary endpoint) and 2-hour mealtime PPG increments (change from baseline to 26 
weeks of treatment) based on the standardised meal test, using ANOVA model with treatment, type of diabetes, 
CGM-strata and region as factors and the corresponding PPG increment at baseline as a covariate. In addition, 
number of treatment-emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes (in total, daytime, 
and nocturnal) from baseline until week 26, was analysed using negative binomial regression model with a 
log-link function, the logarithm of the exposure as offset, and with  treatment, type of diabetes, CGM strata and 
region as factors. 
Trial 4049 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints will be based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Change from baseline in HbA1c after 
18 weeks of treatment was analysed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM) where all 
calculated changes in HbA1c from baseline at visits 16, 22 and 28 were included in the analysis. This model will 
include treatment, region, strata (type of once daily basal insulin (insulin detemir, insulin glargine or human 
isophane insulin, NPH)) as fixed effects, Subject as random effect, HbA1c at baseline as covariate and 
interactions between all fixed effects and visit and between covariate and visit. An unstructured covariance 
matrix was used to describe the variability for the repeated measurements for a subject. From this model 
contrasts were set up to estimate the relevant treatment difference together with a 95% confidence interval and 
associated p-value. 
Superiority is considered confirmed if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the 
estimated treatment difference (FIAsp+basal minus basal), which is calculated using the FAS, is below 0 %.

Results 
Participant flow 
Subject disposition of the subjects included in the therapeutic confirmatory trials (3852, 3853 and 4049) are 
presented by treatment in Table 22. Overall, a total of 1219 subjects with T1DM or T2DM were exposed to Fiasp: 
763 subjects with T1DM and 456 subjects with T2DM in the therapeutic confirmatory trials.

Recruitment 
Trial 3852 (26+26 weeks basal-bolus trial in subjects with T1DM) : A total of 169 sites screened subjects and 
163 sites randomised subjects in 9 countries across North America and Europe. 
Trial 3853 (26-week basal-bolus trial in subjects with T2DM) : A total of 135 sites screened subjects and 123 
sites randomised subjects in 9 countries across North America, Europe and Asia (India). 
Trial 4049 (18-week basal-bolus vs. basal trial in subjects with T2DM): A total of 51 sites screened subjects and 
45 sites randomised/assigned subjects in 6 countries across North and South America, Europe and Asia (India). 
All studies were global, multicentre studies. All studies included a relevant proportion of patients from EU. 
Conduct of the study 
No protocol amendment was made after the initiation of any of the trials (or inclusion of first patient). The 
amendments made are not considered to affect the outcome or interpretation of the data. 
With regards to trials 3852 and 3853, the Applicant submitted exhaustive data listings with protocol deviations. 
In the response to D120 LOQ the applicant explained that their use of strict definitions of important protocol 
deviations had resulted in a large number of registered protocol deviations; the Applicant performed the 
requested re-run of the non-inferiority analyses based on the restricted PP population. The results of this

analysis were almost identical to that of the original PP population and confirmed the results of the primary 
non-inferiority analysis of HbA1c.  
In trial 4049, protocol deviations were rather few and evenly distributed between treatment groups. The data 
does not evoke any concerns on the conduct of the study.

Numbers analysed 
The number of randomised subjects was somewhat larger than initially planned for study 3852. According to the 
analysis sets presented in study 3852, relatively high percentages of subjects complied with the protocol and 
completed the trial, which is indicative of a successfully conducted trial. The per protocol and trial completion 
numbers were lower for study 3853. As conventional, the per protocol analysis set was prospectively defined. 
Further to CHMP questions regarding reported protocol deviations (see above - conduct of the study), the 
requested re-run of the non-inferiority analyses based on the restricted PP population was submitted. The 
results of this analysis were almost identical to that of the original PP population and, thus, confirmed the results 
of the primary non-inferiority analysis of HbA1c.  
In trial 4049 the drop-outs were few and evenly distributed between age groups. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Prespecified hierarchical testing in trials 3852 and 3853 
In trials 3852 and 3853, the confirmatory endpoints were analysed using a hierarchical testing procedure to 
control the type I error rate. The results of the testing procedures are shown in Table 24 (trial 3852) and Table 
25 (trial 3853).

Description of selected endpoints 
HbA1c over time 
Change in HbA1c from baseline to end of treatment was the primary endpoint in each of the therapeutic 
confirmatory trials (3852, 3853 and 4049;

to optimise basal insulin treatment and the treatment period are displayed with a vertical line marking the 
baseline (randomisation). In trial 3852 in subjects with T1DM, all subjects received NovoRapid as bolus insulin 
during the run-in period. In trials 3853 and 4049 in subjects with T2DM, all OADs other than metformin were 
discontinued at the start of the run-in period, during which subjects were treated with basal insulin and 
metformin. Bolus insulin treatment was not initiated until at randomisation. The mean estimates and treatment 
differences for the primary endpoint are shown in

Subjects achieving HbA 1c targets  
The proportion of subjects achieving the ADA HbA1c target of <7.0% at the end of treatment and related 
composite endpoints were derived in all 3 therapeutic confirmatory trials. The observed mean percentages of 
subjects achieving HbA1c <7.0% as well as the percentage of subjects with HbA1c <7.0% without severe 
hypoglycaemia and the percentage of subjects with HbA1c <7.0% without severe hypoglycaemia and with 
minimal weight gain are presented by trial and treatment in Figure 21.  
In all 3 trials, the percentage of subjects achieving target HbA1c <7% increased from baseline to end of 
treatment (Figure 21). The increase was most pronounced in trial 3853 and in the basal-bolus group in trial 4049 
due to the intensification of insulin therapy.

Postprandial glucose in standardised meal test 
In trials 3852 and 3853, standardised meal tests were included at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment for 
the measurement of postprandial glucose (PPG) over 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours. The corresponding PPG increments 
were derived by subtracting the PPG measurement from the pre-prandial plasma glucose measurement.  
Trial 3852 – postprandial glucose increments 
Mean increments in plasma glucose during the meal test at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment are 
presented in Figure 22 for trial 3852.  
Mealtime Fiasp 
The 2-hour PPG increment decreased from baseline to the end of treatment (estimated change: -0.29 mmol/L) 
with mealtime Fiasp, whereas it increased with mealtime NovoRapid (estimated change: 0.38 mmol/L). The 
estimated mean treatment difference of -0.67 mmol/L [-1.29; -0.04]95%CI was statistically significant in favour 
of Fiasp. 
The 1-hour PPG increment was reduced from baseline with mealtime Fiasp (estimated change: -0.84 mmol/L), 
and increased with mealtime NovoRapid (estimated change: 0.34 mmol/L) with the estimated mean treatment 
difference being -1.18 mmol/L [-1.65; -0.71]95%CI. The change from baseline was statistically significantly 
different for the two treatments in favour of mealtime Fiasp as also seen for the 2-hour PPG increment.  
Post-meal Fiasp 
The 1-hour PPG increment also increased from baseline with post-meal Fiasp (estimated change: 1.27 mmol/L), 
and the estimated increase was statistically significantly greater for post-meal Fiasp compared to mealtime 
NovoRapid. The estimated treatment difference (post-meal Fiasp – mealtime NovoRapid) was statistically 
significant in favour of mealtime NovoRapid (0.93 mmol/L [0.46; 1.40]95%CI). There were no statistically 
significant treatment differences (post-meal Fiasp – NovoRapid) in PPG increments at 2, 3 and 4 hours (120, 180 
and 240 minutes) after start of the meal test.

Trial 3853 – postprandial glucose increments 
Mean plasma glucose increments calculated based on meal tests at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment are 
presented in Figure 23. 
Fiasp reduced the 2-hour PPG increment by 3.24 mmol/L (estimated change from baseline) and NovoRapid 
reduced the 2-hour PPG increment by 2.87 mmol/L (estimated change). The estimated treatment difference, 
-0.36 mmol/L [-0.81; 0.08]95%CI, was not statistically significant. The 1-hour PPG increment was also reduced 
with both treatments. For Fiasp, the estimated reduction in the 1-hour PPG increment (2.14 mmol/L) was 
statistically significantly greater compared to that of NovoRapid (1.55 mmol/L) and greater than the reduction 
seen at 2 hours (treatment difference -0.59 mmol/L [-1.09; -0.09] 95%CI). The results of the prespecified and the 
post-hoc sensitivity analyses for the 2-hour PPG increment were comparable to that of the original analysis.

Post-meal glucose increments based on meal test in trials 3852 and 3853 and in across trial 
analysis 
In an across trial analysis including both the T1DM and T2DM populations, the results supplemented those of the 
individual trials (Figure 24). The estimated treatment difference (Fiasp - NovoRapid) was -0.90 mmol/L 
[-1.24; -0.56]95%CI for the change from baseline in 1-hour PPG increment and -0.52 mmol/L [-0.93; -0.11]95%CI 
for the change in 2-hour PPG increment.  
The results of the across trial analyses of 1-hour and 2-hour PPG increments against missing data were 
investigated in sensitivity analyses. The results of all the sensitivity analyses were comparable to the results of 
the original across trial analyses.

The observed rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 PYE was: 5899, 5443 and 5865 
for mealtime Fiasp, post-meal Fiasp and NovoRapid, respectively. The estimated rate ratio for severe or BG 
confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.01 [0.88; 1.15]95%CI (mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid) and 0.92 
[0.81; 1.06]95%CI (post-meal Fiasp versus NovoRapid), showing no statistically significant differences between 
the treatment groups after 26 weeks of treatment. 
Trial 3853 
The observed rate of episodes of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia was 1787.8 episodes per 100 PYE in the 
Fiasp group and 1659.1 episodes per 100 PYE in the NovoRapid group. The estimated rate ratio (Fiasp vs.

NovoRapid) for severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.09 [0.88; 1.36]95%CI after 26 weeks of 
randomised treatment and no statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups. 
Figure 23 Treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes in 
across trial analysis (trials 3852 and 3853) 
The across trial analyses of all, daytime and nocturnal treatment-emergent severe or BG confirmed 
symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes showed that the estimated event rates per 100 patient years of exposure 
(PYE) were similar for Fiasp and NovoRapid both during the full 26-week treatment period (Figure 25) and during 
the maintenance period. The sensitivity analyses supported the results of the original analyses, showing 
comparable results.

The mean 9-point SMPG profiles at baseline and at the end of the trial are shown in Figure 27. The estimated 
reductions for the change from baseline in PPG and change from baseline in PPG increment after 26 weeks of 
treatment based on the SMPG profiles were generally not statistically significantly different between treatments 
except for the lunch meal where the estimated reduction in the PPG increment was statistically significantly 
greater for the Fiasp group than for the NovoRapid group (-0.35 (mmol/L) [-0.65; -0.05]95%CI).  
For the endpoint ‘change from baseline in the mean of the SMPG profile’, there was no statistically significant

1,5-anhydroglucitol (GlycoMark) 
In trial 3852, in subjects with T1DM, mean 1,5-AG increased from baseline to week 26 in all 3 treatment groups 
(0.85 µg/mL, 0.19 µg/mL and 0.35 µg/mL for Fiasp (meal), Fiasp (post-meal) and NovoRapid, respectively). For 
mealtime Fiasp, the change from baseline in 1,5-AG was statistically significantly greater compared to mealtime 
NovoRapid after 26 weeks of treatment (estimated mean treatment difference: 0.50 µg/mL [0.24; 0.76]95%CI). 
For post-meal Fiasp as compared to mealtime NovoRapid, there was no statistically significant difference in 
1,5-AG after 26 weeks.  
In trial 3853, in subjects with T2DM, mean 1,5-AG increased from baseline to week 26 in both the Fiasp and the 
NovoRapid treatment groups, with no statistically significant difference between treatments (5.82 µg/mL  vs  
6.25 µg/mL, Fiasp and NovoRapid, respectively). 
In trial 4049, the addition of Fiasp to basal insulin (in combination with metformin) led to a marked increase in 
the estimated mean 1,5-AG after 18 weeks of treatment in the Fiasp + basal group (5.28 µg/mL) , which was 
statistically significantly greater than the increase obtained in the basal group (1.04 µg/mL; estimated mean 
treatment difference: 4.24 µg/mL [3.04; 5.44]95%CI). 
Fasting plasma glucose 
In trial 3852, the change from baseline in FPG was -0.17 mmol/L for Fiasp (meal), -0.15 mmol/L for Fiasp 
(post-meal) and 0.08 mmol/L for NovoRapid. There was no statistically significant difference in FPG for mealtime 
Fiasp compared to mealtime NovoRapid or for post-meal Fiasp compared to mealtime NovoRapid after 26 weeks 
of treatment.  
In trial 3853, the change from baseline in FPG was 0.02 mmol/L for Fiasp and -0.24 mmol/L for NovoRapid and 
in trial 4049, the change from baseline in FPG was -0.89 mmol/L for Fiasp + basal and -0.77 mmol/L for basal. 
No statistically significant treatment difference with respect to FPG was observed in trial 3853 after 26 weeks or 
in trial 4049 after 18 weeks of treatment.  
Fasting lipid profile 
In trial 3852, there were no statistically significant treatment differences in change from baseline for any of the 
fasting lipids after 26 weeks of treatment, except with respect to HDL cholesterol, for which a statistically 
significant increase in HDL cholesterol was observed for the post-meal Fiasp treatment arm as compared to the 
NovoRapid arm. Given the size of the change and the fact that no other statistically significant treatment 
differences with respect to fasting lipids were observed either in trial 3853 after 26 weeks or in trial 4049 after 
18 weeks of treatment, the treatment difference is not considered clinically meaningful.  
Insulin dose 
Trial 3852 
In trial 3852, the median daily bolus insulin doses were similar in the 3 treatment arms after 26 weeks of 
treatment: 29.7 U (0.39 U/kg) in the mealtime Fiasp arm, 31.0 U (0.39 U/kg) in the post-meal Fiasp arm and 
30.0 U (0.38 U/kg) in the NovoRapid arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 72/132 
  
  
 
The median daily basal insulin dose was slightly lower in the mealtime Fiasp arm (30.0 U (0.39 U/kg)) as 
compared to the post-meal Fiasp arm (34.0 U (0.42 U/kg)) and the NovoRapid arm (32.0 U (0.43 U/kg)) after 
26 weeks of treatment. The median basal dose was stable and similar at start and end of treatment in each of 
the 3 treatment arms.  
Approximately 50% of the total daily insulin dose after 26 weeks treatment was provided by bolus insulin for 
each of mealtime Fiasp (51%), post-meal Fiasp (48%) and NovoRapid (49%).  
Trial 3853 
A similar pattern of bolus dose results as described above was observed in trial 3853, with similar median daily 
bolus insulin doses in the 2 treatment arms after 26 weeks of treatment: 43.0 U (0.49 U/kg) in the Fiasp arm 
and 45.5 U (0.51 U/kg) in the NovoRapid arm. The median daily basal insulin dose was slightly higher in the 
Fiasp arm (48.0 U (0.53 U/kg)) as compared to the NovoRapid arm (42.0 U (0.48 U/kg)) after 26 weeks of 
treatment, mirroring the pattern seen at baseline.  
For both treatment groups, 56% of the total daily insulin dose after 26 weeks treatment was provided by bolus 
insulin. 
Trial 4049 
As expected, the median daily bolus insulin dose increased during the treatment period, from a median starting 
dose of 18.0 U (0.23 U/kg) at week 1 to 39.3 U (0.48 U/kg) after 18 weeks of treatment in the Fiasp + basal 
group, due to the addition and titration of Fiasp as the mealtime insulin. By contrast, in the basal group, in which 
insulin was not titrated after week 1, the median daily basal dose was 48.0 U (0.6 U/kg) at week 1 and 52.0 U 
(0.6 U/kg) at the end of treatment. 
In the Fiasp + basal group, 55% of the total daily insulin dose after 26 weeks treatment was provided as bolus 
insulin. 
Body weight 
In trial 3852 in subjects with T1DM, mean body weight increased slightly from baseline to week 26 in all 3 
treatment groups (0.67 kg for Fiasp (meal), 0.70 kg for Fiasp (post-meal) and 0.55 kg NovoRapid, respectively). 
There was no statistically significant treatment difference after 26 weeks of treatment.  
In trial 3853, in subjects with T2DM, mean body weight increased from baseline in both treatment groups to a 
similar extent, with no statistically significant difference between treatments after 26 weeks (2.67kg for Fiasp 
and 2.68 kg for NovoRapid).  
In trial 4049, in subjects with T2DM, a statistically significantly greater mean body weight increase was observed 
in the Fiasp + basal treatment group as compared to the basal group after 18 weeks of treatment (1.83 kg for 
Fiasp and 0.17 kg for basal insulin). The mean weight gain in the Fiasp + basal group was still below 2 kg. 
Patient reported outcomes 
In the therapeutic confirmatory basal-bolus trials, 3852 and 3853, aspects of health-related quality of life were 
assessed by two PRO questionnaires; one generic (the Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2; SF-36v2) and 
one specific for diabetes (treatment related impact measure – diabetes; TRIM-D).  
Short-Form 36 health survey version 2 
At baseline in trial 3852 in subjects with T1DM, the scores in all domains were close to 50 (i.e., the U.S. 
population average), which indicated a relatively good health status of the subjects at baseline. The observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 73/132 
  
  
mean scores changed marginally in all 3 treatment groups after 26 weeks of treatment, and the changes were 
not considered clinically meaningful. 
A similar pattern was observed in trial 3853 in subjects with T2DM, with mean scores changing marginally from 
baseline in both groups after 26 weeks of treatment. None of the estimated changes were considered clinically 
meaningful. 
Treatment Related Impact Measure - Diabetes (TRIM-D) 
At baseline in trial 3852, there were no marked differences in the observed mean dimension scores between 
treatment groups. The mean scores changed marginally in all 3 treatment groups after 26 weeks of treatment. 
There was no consistent pattern in the magnitude and direction of the estimated changes from baseline in the 
different domains or between treatment groups.   
In trial 3853, scores were lower for all domains in both treatment groups after 26 weeks of randomised 
treatment, except for the domain ‘diabetes management’. There was a general trend that scores were lower for 
the Fiasp group compared to NovoRapid group, and the treatment differences were statistically significantly 
different for the domains ‘treatment burden’, ‘diabetes management’ and ‘TRIM-D total score’. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of efficacy 
The intrinsic factors investigated were demographic factors (age, sex, race and ethnicity) and disease factors 
(duration of diabetes, HbA1c, BMI and concomitant illness such as renal or hepatic impairment, at baseline or 
screening). The extrinsic factors were treatment related factors and region. The treatment related factors 
included concomitant medication having glucose increasing or decreasing effect (other than antidiabetic drugs), 
basal insulin regimen at randomisation (T1DM), and method of insulin dose adjustment (T1DM).  
Comparisons were made between Fiasp and NovoRapid for trial 3852 in subjects with T1DM and trial 3853 in 
subjects with T2DM. The evaluation was made for each trial separately, and in trial 3852, for mealtime Fiasp and 
post-meal Fiasp separately. Pooling of the two trials was not done to prevent the possibility that heterogeneity 
in the trial populations (T1DM and T2DM) might mask potential subgroup differences or complicate the 
interpretation of the results since the two trials would contribute differently to the different subgroups.  
The subgroup analyses were performed for primary endpoint (change from baseline in HbA1c) and selected 
secondary endpoints (change in 1-hour and 2-hour PPG increments (meal test) and 1,5-AG). 
The subgroup analysis did not indicate any consistent overall impact of the investigated intrinsic or extrinsic 
factors on the efficacy of Fiasp vs. NovoRapid.

Design 
This trial was a 26+26-week, randomised (1:1:1), multicentre, multinational, 
active-controlled, parallel-group trial in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes. The aim of 
the trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of mealtime Fiasp with mealtime 
NovoRapid, both in combination with once- or twice-daily insulin detemir in a 
double-blind basal−bolus regimen. An 8-week run-in period was included during which 
the basal insulin treatment was optimised using a treat-to-target approach. The trial also 
included a 26-week open-label post-meal Fiasp arm in combination with once- or 
twice-daily insulin detemir. This arm did not include the additional 26-week treatment 
period. The initial 26-week partly double-blind treatment period with the three parallel 
treatment arms was for the primary analysis of efficacy and safety. The additional 
26-week double-blind treatment with the two mealtime dosing arms was for further 
evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy. Results from the initial 26-week trial period 
are described in this clinical trial report synopsis.  
Subjects with a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤9.5% (80 mmol/mol) measured at 
week 7 of the 8-week run-in period were randomised to continue using double-blinded 
mealtime NovoRapid   (administered 0−2 minutes prior to main meals), or to receive 
either double-blinded mealtime Fiasp (administered 0−2 minutes prior to main meals), 
or open-label post-meal Fiasp (administered 20 minutes after the start of eating main 
meals), all in addition to insulin detemir. Extra bolus dosing was allowed at the 
investigator’s recommendation.

Analyses of efficacy endpoints were based on the full analysis set (FAS).  
and description 
If efficacy of mealtime Fiasp was confirmed, as assessed by comparing the change from 
baseline in HbA 1c after 26 weeks treatment difference to a noninferiority limit of 0.4%, 
the trial also aimed to compare treatment arms for a number of confirmatory secondary 
endpoints. The family-wise type I error rate was controlled in the strong sense using a 
Assessment report

hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing procedure. This was based on a priority ordering of 
the null-hypotheses, and testing them in this order using the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval approach until an insignificant result appeared. The effect was that rejection of 
the null hypothesis only was confirmed for endpoints where all previous null-hypotheses 
had been rejected in favour of Fiasp. 
The steps in the hierarchical testing procedure were: 
Step 1. Primary analysis: Change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of randomised 
treatment (noninferiority of mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid  ) 
Step 2. Change from baseline in 2-hour PPG increments after 26 weeks of randomised 
treatment (meal test) (superiority of mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid)  
Step 3. Change from baseline in HbA 1c after 26 weeks of randomised treatment 
(noninferiority of  post-meal Fiasp versus NovoRapid) 
Step 4. Number of treatment-emergent severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes from baseline until week 26 (superiority of mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid  ) 
Step 5. Change from baseline in body weight after 26 weeks of randomised treatment 
(superiority of mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid  ) 
Step 6. Number of treatment-emergent severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes from baseline until week 26 (superiority of post-meal Fiasp versus NovoRapid). 
Step 7. Change from baseline in body weight after 26 weeks of randomised treatment 
(superiority of  post-meal Fiasp versus NovoRapid)

Notes 
In total, 81 (7.1%) subjects were withdrawn from the trial at or after randomisation: 
30 (7.9%) subjects in the mealtime Fiasp group, 27 (7.1%) subjects in the post-meal 
Fiasp group and 24 (6.3%) subjects in the NovoRapid group.  
The most frequent reason for withdrawal was ‘withdrawal by subject’: 17 subjects in the 
mealtime Fiasp group, 7 subjects in the post-meal Fiasp group and 10 subjects in the 
NovoRapid   group. Eleven (11) subjects were withdrawn due to AEs: 5 subjects in the 
mealtime Fiasp group, 4 subjects in the post-meal Fiasp group and 5 subjects in the 
NovoRapid   group. 
Subjects in the NovoRapid group generally discontinued later in the trial (mainly after 
week 14) compared to the two Fiasp treatment groups in which subjects discontinued on 
a more on-going basis throughout the trial.

controlled, treat-to-target, parallel group trial comparing the efficacy and safety of 
mealtime Fiasp vs. mealtime NovoRapid  , both in combination with once-daily insulin 
glargine and metformin in a basal-bolus regimen. 
The total duration of the trial was approximately 40 weeks: 2 weeks for screening, an 
8-week run-in period (basal insulin titration), a 26-week double-blind treatment period 
(bolus insulin titration), a follow-up contact 1 week after end-of-treatment and an 
additional follow-up contact 30 days after end-of-treatment. 
The trial included a screening visit to assess the subject’s eligibility and additional weekly 
visits/phone contacts during the 8-week run-in and the 26-week double-blind treatment 
period. At run-in, subjects eligible to enter the trial were switched from their previous 
basal insulin to once-daily insulin glargine at their pre-trial dose and had all their current 
oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) treatments discontinued, with the exception of metformin 
treatment which was continued without changing the frequency or dose throughout the 
trial. Subjects on a metformin combination product had to stop the combination product 
at run-in continuing on metformin only, at the same dose as in the combination product. 
At randomisation (visit 10, week 0), mealtime bolus insulin either Fiasp or NovoRapid was 
initiated.

Hypothesis 
Primary objective 
To confirm efficacy of treatment with mealtime Fiasp in terms of glycaemic control 
measured by HbA 1c after 26 weeks of randomised treatment, by comparing to mealtime 
NovoRapid  , both in combination with once-daily insulin glargine and metformin, using a 
non-inferiority approach. 
Secondary objectives  
To confirm superiority of mealtime Fiasp vs. mealtime NovoRapid  , both in combination 
with once-daily insulin glargine and metformin after 26 weeks of randomised treatment 
in terms of: 
Post prandial glucose (PPG) regulation 
Number of hypoglycaemic episodes 
Body weight regulation 
To compare other efficacy and safety endpoints of mealtime Fiasp with mealtime 
NovoRapid, both in combination with once-daily insulin glargine and metformin, after 26 
weeks of randomised treatment.

Results and Analysis  
Analysis description 
Primary Analysis 
Analysis population 
and description 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints were based on the full analysis set (FAS). If efficacy of 
Fiasp could be confirmed, as assessed by comparing the difference vs. NovoRapid   in 
change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment to a non-inferiority limit of 
0.4%, then the trial also aimed to show superiority of Fiasp over NovoRapid   for a 
number of confirmatory secondary endpoints. The family-wise type I error rate was 
controlled in the strong sense using a hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing procedure. 
This was based on an a priori ordering of the null-hypotheses and testing them in this 
order using the two sided 95% CI approach until an insignificant result appeared. The 
effect was that superiority only would be confirmed for endpoints where all previous 
null-hypotheses had been rejected in favour of Fiasp. 
The steps in the hierarchical testing procedure were: 
Step 1. Primary analysis: Change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of randomised 
treatment (non-inferiority of mealtime Fiasp vs. NovoRapid  ) 
Step 2. Change from baseline in 2-hour PPG increment after 26 weeks of randomised 
treatment (meal test) 
Step 3. Number of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes from baseline to 
week 26 
Step 4. Change from baseline in body weight after 26 weeks of randomised treatment

In total, 83 subjects withdrew or were withdrawn from the trial at or after 
randomisation; 44 subjects from the Fiasp group and 39 subjects from the NovoRapid   
group. For both treatment groups, the main reason for being withdrawn was criterion 
#10, non-compliance with trial procedures (11 subjects in the Fiasp group and 
6 subjects in the NovoRapid   group). In total 30 subjects withdrew at their own will from 
the trial; 15 subjects from each treatment group. Seven (7) subjects were withdrawn 
due to AEs (2 subjects in the Fiasp group and 5 subjects in the NovoRapid   group). Three 
(3) subjects were withdrawn due to reason ‘other’. One of these subjects was in fact 
withdrawn due to AEs.

Study identifier: NCT01850615. See Trial 4049 report body (M 5.3.5.1) 
Design 
This was a multicentre, multinational, randomised (1:1), open-label, parallel group trial 
comparing the efficacy and safety of mealtime Fiasp in a basal-bolus regimen with once 
daily insulin detemir, insulin glargine or human isophane insulin, Neutral Protamine 
Hagedorn (NPH), versus once daily insulin detemir or insulin glargine or human isophane 
insulin, NPH, in combination with metformin. 
Subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 18 years of age or older, who were 
being treated with once-daily insulin detemir, insulin glargine or human isophane insulin, 
NPH, in addition to metformin ± other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (sulfonylurea (SU) 
or glinide or dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and/or alpha-glucosidase 
inhibitors (AGI)) prior to the screening visit. 
At the start of the 8-week run-in period, subjects continued on the once-daily basal 
insulin (insulin detemir, insulin glargine or human isophane insulin, NPH) and metformin 
at the same dose-level as before the trial. Any OADs except metformin were to be 
discontinued when the run-in period started; no anti-diabetic treatment other than 
metformin was allowed during the trial. 
At randomisation, subjects were randomised to either the basal arm or the basal-bolus 
arm, both in combination with metformin. Subjects in the basal-bolus treatment arm 
started to inject Fiasp before each main meal, in addition to their basal insulin and 
metformin treatment. Subjects in the basal insulin treatment arm continued on the basal 
insulin and metformin treatment. 
The total duration of the trial was approximately 32 weeks and consisted of a 2-week 
screening period, 8-week run-in period, 18-week treatment period and 7-day and 30-day 
follow-up periods.

Notes 
In total, 14 subjects were withdrawn from the trial at or after randomisation. Nine 
subjects were withdrawn from the Fiasp + basal arm due to protocol violation 
(4 subjects), withdrawal by subject (3 subjects) and AE (2 subjects). Five subjects were 
withdrawn from the basal arm due to protocol violation (1 subject), withdrawal by 
subject (1 subject), AE (1 subject), loss to follow-up (1 subject) and other reason 
(1 subject who was incarcerated and unable to attend study visits).

Trial 3931 (6-week pump compatibility trial in subjects with T1DM) 
Trial 3931 was a 6-week randomised (2:1), double-blind, active-controlled pump trial in 37 subjects with T1DM 
on a pre-trial CSII regimen for ≥6 months with an insulin analogue for ≥3 months. The trial compared the pump 
compatibility and safety of Fiasp and NovoRapid using CSII by external pump with the secondary aim of 
evaluating short-term efficacy and safety. Subjects had their insulin in the CSII switched to NovoRapid, which

was used during a 2 week run-in period prior to randomisation to reinforce correct use of the device. Two sites 
screened and randomised subjects; 1 in the U.S. and 1 in Germany. 
Follow-up 1: 7 days after end of treatment for collection of treatment-emergent adverse events and new diabetes treatment. 
Follow-up 2: 30 days after end of treatment for recording information on cardiovascular events requiring medical assistance

Trial 3930 (3-way, 2-week period, crossover CSII trial in subjects with T1DM) 
Trial 3930 was a randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, active-controlled, 3-way crossover CSII trial in 43 subjects 
with T1DM on a pre-trial CSII regimen for ≥6 months with an insulin analogue for ≥3 months. The trials 
compared 3 different formulations of insulin aspart after 2 weeks of treatment with each, using CSII by external 
pump, with regard to 2-hour post-meal glucose response after a standardised meal and other efficacy, safety 
and pump related endpoints. Subjects were randomised to receive the trial products (Fiasp, NovoRapid and 
FIA(R); an earlier formulation of Fiasp not pursued for further development) in one of six treatment sequences 
in this crossover trial. The trial was conducted at a single site in the U.S.

Compatibility and pump-related parameters 
In trial 3931, the 6-week pump compatibility trial, no microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set 
occlusions (primary endpoint) were observed with treatment with either Fiasp or NovoRapid. None of the 
premature infusion set changes reported in trials 3931 and 3930 were associated with formation of a plug.  
Assessment report

Exploratory efficacy parameters 
In trial 3931, Fiasp appeared to be effective in controlling blood glucose levels as assessed by several measures 
of intermediate and long-term glycaemic control, such as HbA1c, serum fructosamine, and 1,5-AG, and 
measures related to postprandial glucose control, such as 2-hour PPG increment (SMPG) and mean of 9-point 
SMPG profile. There were no statistically significant differences observed between treatments. With the 
exception of FPG (where a larger decrease was observed with NovoRapid than with Fiasp in trial 3931), the 
results obtained in trial 3931 for the glycaemic control parameters were in line with those obtained for subjects 
with T1DM in the therapeutic confirmatory trial 3852.  
In trial 3930, a statistically significantly greater glucose-lowering effect was demonstrated with Fiasp compared 
to NovoRapid in terms of mean change in the plasma glucose concentration during the first 2 hours of a 
standardised meal test (∆PGav,0-2h) (estimated treatment difference: -0.99 mmol/L [-1.95; -0.03]95%CI). The 
mean change over the first hour after the meal (∆PGav,0-1h) pointed in the same direction. Fiasp was comparable 
to NovoRapid across most other endpoints related to overall glucose control.  
The finding of a lower post-meal glucose increment with Fiasp as compared to NovoRapid was supported by 
mean prandial IG increments during 14 days of CGM that were statistically significantly lower for Fiasp at 1 hour 
and 2 hours after all meals. 
Insulin dose 
In trial 3931, the median daily bolus insulin dose at end of treatment (Week 6) was similar for Fiasp (26 U (0.28 
U/kg) and NovoRapid (27 U (0.34 U/kg). The median daily basal insulin dose at end of treatment (Week 6) was 
slightly lower with Fiasp (21U (0.25 U/kg)) than NovoRapid (24 U (0.30 U/kg). 
Approximately 50% of the total daily dose after 6 weeks treatment was provided by bolus insulin for both Fiasp 
(53%) and NovoRapid (52%).  
In trial 3930, the median daily bolus insulin dose at end of treatment (Day 14) was similar for Fiasp (0.22 U/kg) 
and NovoRapid (0.21 U/kg). The median daily basal insulin dose at end of treatment (Day 14) was 0.29 U/kg for 
both of Fiasp and NovoRapid. 
Body weight 
In trial 3931, mean body weight remained stable from baseline to end of treatment in both groups, and there 
was no clinically relevant difference in body weight between the Fiasp treatment group and the NovoRapid group 
at end of treatment.   
Trial 3852 – 26 week extension phase 
For the description of the design of the study, please see the main study. The additional 26 week period of the 
trial was conducted in order to gather longer-time safety data such as antibodies development. Only meal-time 
arms were included in the additional 26 weeks of the trial. 
During the extension phase of the study, visit intervals were extended from 4 to 6 weeks. Only results of the two 
mealtime groups (entire 52-week treatment period) are presented since the post-meal group was ended at 
week 26. The term ’baseline’ refers to randomisation. 
Of a total of 761 subjects randomised to one of the two mealtime groups, 675 (88.7%) subjects completed the 
52-week treatment period (mealtime Fiasp: 337 (88.5%) subjects and NovoRapid: 338 (88.9%) subjects). Thus 
there was no imbalance between treatments with regards to discontinuations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 92/132 
  
  
The primary outcome of the study was the change in HbA1c from baseline at week 26. Thus only a brief 
summary of the outcome of secondary endpoints is provided in the following. 
HbA1c mean changes 
In the run-in and basal optimisation period, all subjects were treated with insulin detemir and NovoRapid. During 
run-in, mean observed HbA1c was reduced from 8.01% to 7.62% in the group subsequently randomised to 
mealtime Fiasp and from 8.00% to 7.58% in the group subsequently randomised to NovoRapid. During the first 
26 weeks of treatment, the observed mean HbA1c was further reduced to 7.26% with mealtime Fiasp and to 
7.40% with NovoRapid, but then increased to 7.51% with mealtime Fiasp and 7.58% with NovoRapid after 52 
weeks of treatment (Error! Reference source not found.). 
The estimated change from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of randomised treatment was -0.08%-points with 
mealtime Fiasp and 0.01%-points with NovoRapid. The estimated treatment difference (mealtime Fiasp versus 
NovoRapid) after 52 weeks of randomised treatment was -0.10%-points [-0.19; -0.00]95%CI and was 
statistically significant. 
Figure 29 HbA1c by treatment week 
Full analysis set. Observed data. Error bars: ± standard error (mean). Subjects in the post-meal faster aspart 
group did not continue in the extension phase of the study. 
HbA1c responders 
The proportion of subjects who achieved the HbA1c targets of <7.0% and ≤6.5% increased from baseline to 52 
weeks of treatment both with mealtime Fiasp and with NovoRapid. 
With mealtime Fiasp, the estimated odds of achieving HbA1c <7.0% after 52 weeks were not statistically 
different from the estimated odds of achieving HbA1c <7.0% with NovoRapid after 52 weeks of treatment. None 
of the other HbA1c responder endpoints were statistically significantly different between mealtime Fiasp and 
NovoRapid.

Postprandial glucose (PPG) 
In both treatment groups, mean PPG increased up to 120 minutes after meal consumption and then started to 
decrease. Estimated treatment differences after 52 weeks of treatment for PPG at 1 and 2 hours after start of the 
meal test both favoured mealtime Fiasp, but only reached statistical significance at 1 hour (Table 33).

After 52 weeks of randomised treatment, the observed mean PPG increment at 1 hour (60 minutes) was reduced 
from 5.39 mmol/L to 4.50 mmol/L (97.17 to 81.16 mg/dL) with mealtime Fiasp and from 5.65 mmol/L to 5.44 
mmol/L (101.87 to 98.10 mg/dL) with NovoRapid. The estimated change from baseline in 1-hour PPG increment 
was -1.05 mmol/L with mealtime Fiasp and -0.14 mmol/L with NovoRapid. The estimated treatment difference 
(mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid) was statistically significant in favour of mealtime Fiasp (-0.91 mmol/L 
[-1.40; -0.43] 95%CI; -16.48 mg/dL [-25.17; -7.80] 95%CI). 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences (mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid) after 52 weeks 
of treatment in PPG increment at 2, 3 and 4 hours (120, 180 and 240 minutes) after start of the meal test. 
Self-measured plasma glucose: 7-9-7-point profiles 
Subjects recorded SMPG as 7-9-7-point profiles on 3 consecutive days before the visits at baseline, week 12, 
week 26, week 40 and week 52 (Figure 32).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is supported by three therapeutic confirmatory trials, including 2068 randomised subjects, 
evaluating efficacy and safety of Fiasp in subjects with T1DM and T2DM. Further to this, two CSII trials, which 
include 80 randomised subjects, provide supportive data. 
No dose-finding study has been performed which is acceptable, considering that the pharmacology program 
show that the glucose-lowering effect of Fiasp is comparable to that of NovoRapid. Furthermore, the insulin dose 
is titrated based on blood glucose levels.

Trial 3852 was of 26-weeks duration and provide data on a double blind comparison of Fiasp with NovoRapid in 
subjects with T1DM; in addition post-meal dosing with Fiasp was investigated. The data from the extension was 
submitted with the responses to the Day 120 LoQ. 
Two studies in T2DM patients were conducted, both with metformin as background treatment. Trial 3853 was a 
double blind study of 26-weeks duration, in which Fiasp was compared to NovoRapid. Trial 4049 was an open 
label study of 18-weeks duration which compared Fiasp in a basal-bolus regimen vs an optimised basal insulin 
regimen.  The shorter duration of trial 4049 is acceptable, considering that only intensification of basal therapy 
was allowed in the comparator arm. The open label design is acceptable, considering the difference in therapy 
(basal-bolus regimen vs basal regimen). 
Inclusion criteria were adequate in order to enrol a population representative for the target population and 
exclusion criteria were relevant and acceptable. Patients with recent CV disease were excluded as the intensive 
treat-to-target approach with ambitious glycaemic goals must be applied with caution in these individuals. This 
is acceptable as the major aim of the studies were to compare Fiasp with NovoRapid applying a treat-to-target 
approach. In addition to standard withdrawal criteria, prespecified withdrawal criteria were in place. 
The choice of NovoRapid as the active comparator in trials 3852 and 3853 is adequate, especially considering 
that Fiasp is a new formulation with insulin aspart.  
In trial 4049, intensification of pre-trial basal insulin therapy was the active comparator, after stopping any 
additional OAD other than metformin. This provides would information on the effect of a bolus-basal versus 
basal insulin therapy. However, the outcome could possibly be affected by the discontinuation of OADs used 
prior to inclusion in the study if the metabolic control deteriorates. 
Titration of the basal insulin dose was done according to pre-set targets. Bolus doses were titrated according to 
prespecified titration algorithms, or using carbohydrate counting (trial 3852). In the three confirmatory studies, 
bolus insulin was only to be administered in the abdomen, whereas basal insulin could be administered in the 
upper arm or thigh. 
Standardised meal tests were performed in trials 3852 and 3853. The test methods applied were adequate. 
The objectives and endpoints were adequate and in line with both scientific advice given by the CHMP and 
current guidelines. However, with respect to the confirmatory secondary endpoint of hypoglycaemia, it is 
noticed that the PG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes are not according to the latest ADA classification 
specified in the current Diabetes guideline. Furthermore, updating of the ADA classification of hypoglycaemia to 
reflect the latest ADA classification was one important amendment to the final protocol prior to randomisation 
for all trials. The measured plasma glucose concentration are specified to be less than or equal to 3.9 mmol/L in 
the ADA classification criteria, but a lower limit value of 3.1 mmol/L was used for the secondary confirmatory 
endpoint in the trials (3852 and 3853). A statistical analysis of hypoglycaemic episodes using the ADA 
classification for trials 3853 and 3853 has been provided; the outcome of this analysis did not change the 
assessment of the primary analysis. 
In general, statistical methods are acceptable. Confidence interval approach for the non-inferiority analysis in 
trials 3852 and 3853 was applied versus a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% (absolute) which was considered 
adequate by EMA (scientific advice from 2011).  
The chosen stratification procedure in studies 3852, 3853 and 4049, ensured an equal distribution of the 
treatment arms within each stratum, but not within a combination of strata, which may explain the fact that 
several centres in study 3852 included subjects who were randomized to 2 treatment groups instead of to 3 
treatment groups.

The Applicant has submitted long and exhaustive appendices containing data listings with important protocol 
deviations. Overall the important protocol deviations were judged by the Applicant not to affect the outcome of 
the trials. Among others, there were issues of noncompliance with the GCP principle regarding informed 
consent, and also poor compliance with study assessments and violations of entry criteria, which are usually 
identified as relevant protocol violations according to the ICH E9. It was unclear if these GCP/ICH principles were 
strictly followed in the current definitions of the analysis populations; however acceptable reassurance with 
regards to adherence to the GCP/ICH principles has been provided. However, a restricted PP analysis set has 
been defined, with additional requirements and after a re-evaluation of deviations related to informed consent, 
as well as violations of entry and withdrawal criteria. Exclusions from this new per protocol population were 
summarized per category and treatment group, and a re-run of the non-inferiority analyses was submitted. The 
results almost identical to that of the original PP population and, thus, confirmed the results of the primary 
non-inferiority analysis of HbA1c. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In all studies, the  study populations were representative for the target population and well balanced between 
study groups with regards to demographic and disease characteristics. Across the study program, about 30 % 
of subjects were recruited from the EU (47 % of T1DM subjects and 26 % of T2DM subjects). It is noted, though, 
that the baseline values for HbA1c are outside the range that was pre-specified in the inclusion criteria for all the 
trials. The Applicant has clarified that only a limited numbers of subjects had HbA1c values outside the inclusion 
criteria at visit 10, and this is therefore not considered to have had any significant impact on the results. 
In general, drop-out rates were low and balanced between groups. In trial 3852, the highest withdrawal rates 
were due to withdrawal by subject (4.5 % in the Fiasp meal group and 2.6 % the NovoRapid group).  The highest 
overall drop-out rate was observed in trial 3853 (T2DM). In this study, between 4.4 and 5.8 % were withdrawn 
due to withdrawal criteria whereas withdrawal by subject was made by a similar proportion (4.3 and 4.4 %). In 
trial 4049 (T2DM), the reasons for discontinuations in the test arm may be related to treatment in at least some 
of the cases, i.e. missing at random not really valid. However the events are few and it is not expected to change 
the results very much.   
During the run-in period in study 3852, the optimising of ongoing treatment leads to a slight decrease in HbA1c. 
In trials 3853 and 4049, there was no change in HbA1c during the run-in period in spite of the fact that all other 
OADs than metformin were discontinued. Thus life-style counselling and optimising basal insulin treatment was 
sufficient to balance the reduction in OAD treatment in these trials. 
Non-inferiority was confirmed for the primary endpoint (mean change in HbA1c from baseline) in both T1DM 
(trial 3852: -0.15 % [-0.23; -0.07]95%CI) and T2DM (trial 3853, -0.02 % [-0.15; 0.10]95%CI) and the 95 % CI 
was well within the non-inferiority margin of 0.4 %. Furthermore, in T1DM patients the upper 95 % CI was below 
zero, indicating superiority of Fiasp (mealtime) over NovoRapid, although the mean treatment difference was 
small. However, it should be noted that testing for superiority was not included in the confirmatory hierarchical 
testing procedure to control for multiplicity. In trial 4049, a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect 
of Fiasp, when compared to optimised basal insulin treatment, was observed (treatment difference -0.94 % 
[-1.17; -0.72] 95%CI). 
In trial 3852, more patients achieved the target of HbA1c <7.0% in the Fiasp meal group (33.3 %) than in the 
NovoRapid group (28.2 %), whereas there was no difference in the proportion of patients reaching the HbA1c 
targets between treatment groups in trial 3853. As expected, in trial 4049, more patients achieved the HbA1c 
targets in the bolus-basal treated group.

EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 97/132 
  
  
In trial 3852, a statistically significant effect onthe 1-hour PPG and the 2-hour PPG increment was observed in 
the Fiasp (meal) treated group compared to NovoRapid, with 2-hour PPG increment being a confirmatory 
secondary endpoint. The magnitude of the difference in post-prandial glucose-lowering effect in trial 3852 
(-0.67 mmol/L) was comparable to that observed in the clinical pharmacology trial 3888 (-0.57 mmol/L) and 
higher than observed in trial 3889 (0.19 mmol/L). The observed differences between trials could be due to the 
comparatively small number of subjects in the clinical pharmacology trials. In trial 3853 there was no 
statistically significant effect on the 2-hour PPG increment, whereas a statistically significant difference was 
observed in favour of Fiasp on the 1-hour PPG increment. In the pooled analysis, including both T1DM and T2DM 
subjects (trials 3852 and 3853), a statistically significant difference in treatment effect on both 1-hour and 
2-hour PPG increment was observed. 
In trial 3852, the overall rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia episodes was comparable for Fiasp 
(meal) and NovoRapid. In trial 3853, the overall rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia episodes was 
higher for Fiasp than for NovoRapid, although not statistically significant. In the pooled analysis, numerically 
slightly more BG confirmed daytime episodes were observed in the Fiasp treated groups, although not 
statistically significant. Nocturnal BG confirmed episodes were numerically slightly less frequent, although again 
not statistically significant. Thus no clinically relevant differences in the overall number of BG confirmed 
episodes were observed. 
Across the trials, comparable effects on the 9-point SMPG profiles were observed for both Fiasp and NovoRapid 
and there were no statistically significant differences between treatments. In trial 4049, the 9-point SMPG curve 
in the basal-bolus treated group showed great resemblance with the curves observed in trial 3853, whereas no 
apparent change in the profile was observed in the basal treated group. 
Plasma 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), has been proposed as a marker for post-meal hyperglycaemia.  However 
there are no outcome studies using this measure of glycaemic control. Change in 1,5-anhydroglucitol was 
included as a secondary endpoint in all confirmatory trials. The results reflect the data from the meal test and 
the SMPG profiles. A statistically significant treatment differences was observed between Fiasp meal and 
NovoRapid (trial 3852; 0.50 µg/mL [0.24; 0.76]95%CI), whereas no significant difference was observed in trial 
3853. In trial 4049, the estimated mean treatment difference was statistically significant and in favour of Fiasp 
(4.24 µg/mL [3.04; 5.44]95%CI). 
No relevant difference in FPG was observed between treatment arms in any of the three studies. The largest 
decrease in FPG was observed in trial 4049. Nor were any clinically relevant differences in lipid profile observed 
in either of the studies. Weight gain is expected with intensified insulin treatment. No relevant differences 
between Fiasp and NovoRapid were observed in the studies. 
In trials 3852 or 3853, there were no apparent differences in the bolus or basal insulin doses between treatment 
arms. In trial 4049, the bolus and basal doses in the Fiasp treated group, were rather similar to the doses in trial 
3853. In trial 3852, about 50 % of the total dose was provided by bolus insulin, whereas the bolus insulin dose 
constituted about 55 % in the T2DM studies. 
The PROs did not show any clinically meaningful changes.  
Data from the long-term extension of trial 3852 show that in both treatment groups, HbA1c increased again 
after the initial decline during the first 26 weeks of treatment. The estimated treatment difference (mealtime 
Fiasp versus NovoRapid) after 52 weeks of randomised treatment was -0.10%-points [-0.19; -0.00]95%CI and 
although statistically significant, the difference was smaller than after 26 weeks. No difference in the HbA1c 
responder endpoints was observed between mealtime Fiasp and NovoRapid. After 52 weeks of treatment, the 
estimated treatment differences for PPG at 1 and 2 hours after start of the meal testt only reached statistical 
Assessment report

Page 98/132 
  
  
significance at 1 hour. The effect on post-prandial glucose control was also reflected in the self-monitored 
glucose profiles at 52 weeks, where the post-prandial increase in blood glucose appeared less pronounced after 
break-fast and lunch in the Fiasp group. 
The 52 week data provided by the Applicant thus indicate that the difference in effect between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid observed in the main study was less pronounced.  
In study 3852, post-meal dosing of Fiasp was compared to NovoRapid in order to support this posology in the 
SmPC. With regards to the mean change from baseline in HbA1c, Fiasp post-meal was non-inferior to NovoRapid 
with the point estimate slightly above zero (0.04 % [-0.04; 0.12]95%CI). The proportion of patients achieving 
HbA1c targets were lower in the Fiasp post-meal group compared to NovoRapid. Furthermore, numerically 
higher 1-hour and 2-hour PPG increment was observed with Fiasp post-meal compared to NovoRapid, with the 
difference at 1-hour being statistically significant in favour of NovoRapid.. Thus the data indicate that a 
comparable effect of Fiasp to that of NovoRapid is achieved when given post-meal, however, the effects on 
1-hour and 2-hour PPG observed with meal Fiasp are not preserved. The data are considered sufficient to 
support the posology. 
No dedicated studies in special populations were performed. Considering the long experience with insulin aspart, 
and the available data on Fiasp, this is acceptable. The clinical trials included almost 200 patients above the age 
of 65 and the experience in this age group is considered adequate whereas the experience in patients above the 
age of 75 is still limited.  
Two supportive studies, trials 3931 and 3930 were submitted in order to provide data on compatibility and 
safety with the use of Fiasp in CSII by external pump. Trial 3930 also provide data on 2-hour PPG after a 
standardised meal. The trials were of adequate design. Notably, compatibility was only tested for the MiniMed 
Paradigm external pump. Although some imbalances with regards to age and sex was observed in trial 3931, the 
studies included a representative, adult T1DM population. 
There was no microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions in trial 3931, thus supporting 
compatibility for Fiasp with the pump system. A more extensive assessment of pump compatibility data is made 
in the section of clinical safety of this report.  
In both trials, most glycaemic control parameters were comparable between Fiasp and NovoRapid. The data 
from the standardised meal test in trial 3930 showed statistically significantly lower 2-hour PPG levels for Fiasp 
compared to NovoRapid, supporting the meal test data obtained from trial 3852 (see also the section on 
“Primary pharmacology” of this report). Interstitial glucose (IG) data obtained by CGM measurements provide 
further support showing lower IG increments post-meal. There were no relevant differences in insulin doses 
between treatment groups in any of the two studies. Body weight remained stable in both treatment groups in 
trial 3931. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The data from the clinical trials show a clinically relevant glucose lowering effect associated with treatment with 
Fiasp as expected considering that the active component is insulin aspart.  
Compared to Novorapid, a small difference in reduction of HbA1c and a statistically significant difference in PPG 
increment in patients with T1DM was documented. HbA1c and PPG outcomes in patients with T2DM were very 
similar in the two treatment groups and no statistically significant differences were shown. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 99/132 
  
  
The clinical relevance of the effect on PPG and the resulting small decrease in HbA1c observed at week 26 in 
T1DM is unclear. The 52 week data in T1DM indicate that the difference in effect between Fiasp and NovoRapid 
observed in the main study was less pronounced. 
Post-meal dosing was also investigated in patients with T1DM and showed a comparable effect to that of 
NovoRapid given before a meal; a direct comparison of post-meal dosing was not studied.   
The data are considered sufficient to support the posology.  
Comparable effects to those of NovoRapid were observed when Fiasp was used for CSII. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety evaluation of Fiasp primarily focused on data from the 2 completed therapeutic confirmatory 
basal-bolus trials in subjects with T1DM and T2DM (trials 3852 and 3853; 26 weeks) as these trials covered the 
intended target populations and enabled a focus on the comparison of the safety profile of Fiasp to NovoRapid. 
The other 3 completed therapeutic confirmatory and exploratory trials 4049 (18 weeks in T2DM), 3931 (6 weeks 
in T1DM) and 3930 (T1DM) were used to support the safety evaluations from the 2 pivotal basal-bolus trials. 
Trials 3930 and 3931 assessed the use of Fiasp in CSII with pumps, with trial 3931 focusing on the compatibility 
of Fiasp with the CSII system. Exposure by treatment groups in the therapeutic confirmatory and exploratory 
trials are presented in Table 34. The “diabetes pool” consisted of trials 3852, 3853, 4049 and 3931 and 
exposure by duration of treatment in the diabetes pool is presented in Table 35.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 100/132 
  
  
 
 
 
Table 30 Exposure by duration of treatment in the diabetes pool 
In the diabetes pool the two pivotal trials 3852 and 3853 accounted for the vast majority (93%) of the exposure 
to Fiasp. Insulin aspart with the new formulation do not have safety results beyond 26 weeks. Safety data from 
study 3852 (T1DM) will in an ongoing extension of the study later be provided up to 52 weeks of exposure. In 
addition long-term safety of insulin aspart is available from results in clinical trials and post-marketing 
experience with other formulations of the product.  
Overall, the safety database seems be sufficient to cover the populations of the planned indications. The main 
limitation is the lack of long-term experience with the new formulation. In addition, off-label use in subjects 
below 18 years is anticipated. There were no subjects included below 18 years in the present studies. Treatment 
of children and adolescents < 18 years of age is classified as missing information in the RMP of Fiasp. A phase 
3b efficacy and safety trial in children is planned. 
In addition, the number of subjects exposed to Fiasp in the age ≥ 65 years (elderly) was 196 (84.2 PYE) and in 
subjects ≥ 75 years (very elderly) 24 (2%) corresponding to 11.2 PYE Table 36. The low exposure of Fiasp in the 
group of patients above 75 years should be reflected in the SmPC.

Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
The percentage of subjects reporting AEs in the diabetes pool was 61% for Fiasp and 65% for the comparator 
and with the corresponding rates 394 and 387 events per 100 PYE, respectively.  There were no difference of 
clinical importance for Fiasp and the comparator group respectively regarding frequency of adverse events as 
well as severity, relation to study drug and outcome of the events (Table 37). 
The most frequently reported PTs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group) were nasopharyngitis 
(37.1 and 33.9 events per 100 PYE for Fiasp and comparator, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection 
(14.9 and 17.8 events per 100 PYE for the two groups, respectively) and headache (14.8 and 17.2 events per 
100 PYE, respectively). 
When summarizing differences in the diabetes pool between the two formulations regarding AE pattern on a PT 
level, most of the PTs had a rate difference close to 0. For some PTs, the confidence interval did not span 0 with 
influenza and sinusitis favouring Fiasp and back pain, abdominal pain upper, dizziness and fall favouring the 
comparator. The clinical relevance for these differences were considered to be low (Figure 33).  
The Applicant looked further into cases with fall and dizziness in relation to hypoglycaemia.  In total 30 events 
of fall occurred in 21 subjects in the diabetes pool. This corresponded to a total rate of 3.1 per100 PYE (4.2 per 
100 PYE in the Fiasp group and 1.7 per 100 PYE in the comparator group, respectively). Based on this analyse 
no possible relationship between the hypoglycaemic episodes and the events of fall (or dizziness) could be 
concluded (five of the events of fall took place on the same day as a hypoglycaemic episode). No other 
underlying factors could be identified.  
Adverse events in general were more common in T1DM (73%) compared to patients with T2DM (53%) with no 
apparent difference between Fiasp and NovoRapid. However, most frequent PT:s were similar between the 
different types of diabetes.

Other significant adverse events 
The rates of Cardiovascular events, Peripheral oedema, Eye disorders (diabetic retinopathy and refraction 
disorders), Peripheral neuropathy and Rare events were seen without any difference of clinical importance 
between Fiasp and the comparator. 
Injection or infusion site reactions  
Overall in a pool of the trials 3852, 3853 and 4049, the rates of injection site reactions were higher for Fiasp (23 
events) than for the comparators (10 events) (3.8 and 2.4 events per 100 PYE, respectively). The total numbers 
of injection site reactions in the pooled data set were 23 events in the Fiasp group and 10 events in the 
comparator group. None of these injection site reactions were serious or severe (Table 38 and Figure 34) 
However, when also including study 3930 and 3931 the total number of events of injection site reactions 
increases to 40 events of injection site reactions of which, 30 occurred in the Fiasp group and 10 in the 
comparator groups.  
Twenty-nine of the 40 events with injection site reactions occurred in T1DM trials. In trial 3852 there were 22 
events of injection site reactions of which 19 occurred in the Fiasp groups without any difference between the 
two groups (mealtime or post-meal Fiasp). In the CSII studies (3930 and 3931) 7 events of injection site 
reactions occurred. All occurred in the Fiasp groups.  
In the T2DM population there was an equally distributed frequency between the two formulations.   
Even if other possible explanations have been suggested for some of the events by the sponsor there is an 
apparent difference both in total frequency of injection site reactions and also injection site reactions judged as 
possible or probably related to study drug between the two formulations, especially in T1DM.

adverse reaction which is endorsed.

Medication errors  
In total 65 events of “wrong drug administered” occurred in 55 (5%) of the subjects. The number of medication 
errors due to wrong drug administered were higher in study 3852 (T1DM) compared to study 3853 (T2DM). The 
possible explanation given is that the blinded pen PDS290 prefilled pen-injector used for Fiasp and NovoRapid 
and the FlexPen injector used for insulin detemir were reported to have certain similarities. The blinded version 
of the PDS290 prefilled pen-injector differs from the version that will be the used for the marketed product. 
According to information in the RMP a summary usability test has been performed in 87 subjects including 21 
subjects with colour blindness. The aim was to validate that PDS290 Fiasp pen-injector could be differentiated 
from other relevant products. All the participants in this study performed, according to the Applicant, the 
differentiation tasks without any usage error or encountering any operational difficulties.  
Medication errors including wrong drug administered is characterised as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Hypoglycaemia  
In the trials, subjects were to always measure and record PG when a hypoglycaemic episode was suspected. PG 
was also measured for 7-point and 4-point self-measured PG (SMPG) profiles, as according to the trial protocols. 
All PG values equal to or below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or higher than 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in conjunction 
with symptoms of hypoglycaemia were to be recorded by the subject in their diary, and subsequently 
transferred by the investigator to a hypoglycaemic episode form in the eCRF at the next visit to site. The ADA 
definition of hypoglycaemia is presented in Figure 35.

In total approximately 98% of the subjects in study 3852 and approximately 94% of the subject in study 3853 
experienced any event of hypoglycaemia. Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in 8% 
of the subjects with T1DM (study 3852) during the trial compared to 3.5% in the patients with T2DM (study 
3853). Thus, a higher rate and frequency of both hypoglycaemic events in total as well as severe and BG 
confirmed hypoglycaemic events were, as expected, more common in patients with T1DM compared to T2DM. 
There was no significant difference between the two formulations in either of the trials. There were no 
differences between the two formulations regarding hypoglycaemia over time of day (daytime and nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia) or accumulation rate of hypoglycaemia over the trial duration.  
Hypoglycaemia in relation to mealtime 
Study 3852 (T1DM) 
A statistical significant difference in rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia episodes was noted between 
the Fiasp mealtime (but not post-meal) and NovoRapid group the first hour after meal. The frequency of 
subjects experiencing severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia one hour after meal was 33.9% in the Fiasp group, 
22.5% in Fiasp post-meal and 28.4% in subjects using NovoRapid. The corresponding rates were 147.6, 71.6 
and 96.4 per 100 PYE respectively. After two hours there was still a difference but no longer significant. The 
difference in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes dilutes over time and 6 hours after meal the frequency of 
events are equally distributed between the groups (Table 39 and Figure 36)

Figure 34 Rates of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 0-6 hours after the start of meal 
in study 3852 
A post-hoc stratified analysis compared subjects who dosed the bolus insulin according to a flexible dosing 
regimen based on meal carbohydrate content to subjects using an algorithm. Within 1 hour after the start of 
meal, the rates of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia was statistically significantly higher for mealtime Fiasp 
than for NovoRapid for those subjects dosing according to the algorithm. For the first 2 hours after the start of 
a meal, the rates were still higher but not statistical significant, for mealtime Fiasp than for NovoRapid for those 
subjects dosing according to the algorithm. 
There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia between 
mealtime Fiasp and NovoRapid for the subjects following the flexible dosing method of counting carbohydrates, 
although the rates were slightly higher for mealtime Fiasp for the first 2 hours after the start of a meal (Table 
40).

Rates were higher for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid within 1 hour after the start of a meal, and were statistically 
significantly higher for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid for episodes occurring within 2 hours of the start of a meal 
(Table 41 and Figure 37). Up to two hours after meal the frequency of subjects experience Severe or BG 
confirmed hypoglycaemia was 32.8% in subjects using Fiasp and 28.2% in patients using NovoRapid. The 
corresponding rates were 226.5 per 100 PYE and 148.5 per 100 PYE, respectively.

meal in trial 3853 
In summary, the overall frequencies of hypoglycaemic episodes did not differ between the two formulations. 
However, the mealtime Fiasp had a statistical significant higher rate of hypoglycaemic episodes (severe or BG 
confirmed, severe or BG confirmed symptomatic and ADA documented) the first hour after meal compared to 
NovoRapid in patients with T1DM. Two hour after meal a difference was still present but this was not significant. 
The group randomised to post-meal Fiasp had rates of hypoglycaemia events similar to the subjects using 
NovoRapid. For patient with T2DM there was a statistical significant difference with higher rate of corresponding 
definitions of hypoglycaemic episodes two hours after meal (a difference was seen also the first hour after meal 
but this was not statistical significant). This difference probably reflects the PK/PD differences in the two 
formulations.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In total 5 deaths were reported after randomisation in the completed clinical trials: 2 in the Fiasp group, 2 in the 
comparator group (of which 1 occurred during the 30-day follow-up period and 1 in the additional part of trial 
3852 which was blinded) (Table 42). In addition two deaths occurred during the run-in phase one in trial 3852 
(self-injurious behaviour) and 1 in trial 4049 (acute myocardial infarction). The numbers of deaths were similar 
for Fiasp and NovoRapid.  
Three of the patients with events leading to fatal outcomes were diagnosed with T2DM and two with T1DM.  All 
deaths occurring in patients with T2DM were adjudicated and confirmed by the EAC as cardiovascular deaths.  
Four of the five deaths were judged as unlikely related to the study drug. One event of pulmonary embolism 
(Subject 502003 in trial 3853) was judged by the investigator as possibly related to trial drug (Fiasp). However, 
this event was confounded by cardiovascular disease in medical history. Further, in the total diabetes pool two 
events of pulmonary embolism were noted. One was noted in the Fiasp group and one in the comparator group. 
In summery the risk of deaths seemed not to reflect a difference between Fiasp and comparator. There was no 
apparent association between insulin aspart and mortality risk. 
Table 37 Adverse event with fatal outcome 
Serious adverse events 
Overall in the diabetes pool, the rates of SAEs were similar for Fiasp and comparator (15.4 and 15.3 events per 
100 PYE, respectively). The frequency of SAEs was approximately 6% of the subjects with no difference between 
type 1 or type 2 diabetes (Table 43). The most comment SAEs was hypoglycaemia and related events. Despite 
these there was no apparent clustering of events in the individual trial. The rates of SAEs were in the individual 
trials similar between the Fiasp and comparator without any apparent difference in SAE pattern on a PT level. 
However, a difference in SAE pattern was noted between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  
A summary of all SAEs in the diabetes pool has been submitted. The major difference is observed for the PT 
hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemic unconsciousness where the reporting was higher for Fiasp (27 and 8 events, 
respectively) than for the comparator (10 and 3 events, respectively).

Excluding hypoglycaemia, the sponsor reported no SAEs occurring in ≥1% of subjects and no SAEs were 
reported in ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group in the diabetes pool. The rates of SAEs, in the diabetes pool, 
possibly or probably related to trial product were 4.8 per 100 PYE for Fiasp and 3.4 per 100 PYE for the 
comparator.  
SAEs judged as related to the study drug were besides hypoglycaemia and related events 2 events of wrong 
drug administered, 1 event of DKA and the events with cardiac myxoma and pulmonary embolism described 
section “Deaths” above. 
Table 38 All serious adverse events – summary –diabetes pool 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity-related events (allergic reactions) 
Overall in the diabetes pool, the rates of allergic reactions were similar for Fiasp and comparator (6.2 and 7.0 
events per 100 PYE, respectively). None were serious (Table 44). 
Rash was the most frequently reported PT for allergic reactions with a rate of 2.0 events per 100 PYE in the Fiasp 
group and 1.3 events per 100 PYE in the comparator group. Eczema was reported with a rate of 0.4 per 100 PYE 
events in the Fiasp group and 1.1 events per 100 PYE in the comparator group. The remaining PTs reported for 
allergic reactions were reported by few or single subjects with no apparent clustering in any group (  
Figure 38). 
The numbers of allergic reactions considered possibly or probably related to trial product by the investigator 
were 2 events of hypersensitivity in 1 subject for Fiasp and 1 event of rash for the comparator. A possible 
association with Fiasp was assessed by the sponsor for the events reported with the PTs dermatitis, eczema, 
rash, rash pruritic and urticaria. Hence, these PTs were suggested for inclusion in the Fiasp label by the sponsor. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 112/132 
  
  
 
 
 
All PTs identified in the search for allergic reactions in the diabetes pool had similar rates for Fiasp and 
NovoRapid. Thus, the available data do not suggest a greater risk of allergic reactions for Fiasp than for 
comparators. 
Allergic skin reactions were reported in 1.5% of subjects on Fiasp and 1.4% in the comparator group. Systemic 
allergic reactions have been suggested as an important identified risk in the RMP for Fiasp. However, even if 
several of the events could be related to a systemic allergic reaction there were only two subjects who 
experienced hypersensitivity events in the Fiasp group (0.2%)  and one in the comparator group (0.1%) and no 
event of anaphylactic reaction were reported. Thus, it could be discussed if Systemic allergic reactions should be 
defined as an identified or potential risk. But the Rapporteur believes it is reasonable to extrapolate data from 
insulin aspart with other formulations in this case and remain Systemic allergic reactions as an important 
identified risk.

Insulin antibodies 
Anti-insulin antibodies (insulin aspart specific antibodies, antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin and the 
total level of antibodies) were assessed in trial 3852 at baseline, week 12 and week 26.  
The presence of antibodies (insulin aspart specific antibodies and antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin 
as well as the total level of antibodies (comprised of the two types of antibodies) was on a group level presented 
as the percent of bound radioactivity (B) out of the total amount of radioactivity (T) (% B/T) on the 3 sampling 
days during the span of the trial. 
According to the Applicant, most of the subjects had insulin antibodies at baseline in all 3 treatment groups due 
to previous insulin treatment. On a group level there seemed to be a slight increase over time (26 weeks) of the 
total anti-insulin antibodies, driven by an increase in cross-reacting antibodies to human insulin (and not insulin 
aspart specific antibodies). This increase was noted in all groups without any difference between the groups 
(Table 45 and Figure 39). There were no association between higher antibody levels and higher or increased 
HbA1c levels.  Neutralizing antibody formation is suggested by the Applicant to insert as an important potential 
risk in the RMP.

Figure 37 Cross-reacting antibodies to human insulin 
Data from the 26 week extension phase of trial 3852 (T1DM) was submitted with the responses to the Day 120 
LoQ. It is concluded that no significant differences were observed between the two formulations. A rather high 
proportion of patients (27% in both groups) were positive for specific antibodies at any time during the study 
and 97-98% of patients were positive to cross-reactive antibodies at any time during the study. However, only 
0.9% and 0.6% of subjects showed a significant change from baseline ≥10 (%B/T) in the Fiasp and NovoRapid 
group, respectively. Analyses of antibody positivity in relation to allergic reaction, injection site reactions and 
change in HbA1c did not reveal any signs of apparent associations. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no indications of a significant difference between the two formulations regarding parameters such as 
Biochemistry and haematology laboratory values, Lipids, Cardiovascular risk markers (hsCRP and NT-proBNP), 
Urine analysis, Vital signs, Physical examination, Body weight and Fundoscopy/fundus photography.

Pump compatibility and related issues  
The primary objective of trial 3931 was to evaluate the compatibility of Fiasp and NovoRapid with the external 
CSII system over a 6-week treatment period. 
A higher frequency of possible infusion-set occlusions was reported for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid (7 vs 0). 
However, in none of the cases the macroscopic or microscopic event was found to be due to formation of a plug.  
No microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion-set occlusions were observed with either Fiasp treatment or 
NovoRapid. 
Thus, even if events of possible infusion-set occlusions leading to prematurely changed infusion sets were higher 
with the Fiasp formulation, no formations of plugs could be verified in any of the formulations. 
Safety in special populations 
The Applicant has presented safety in special populations by intrinsic (demographic) and extrinsic 
(environment) factors and compared subjects on Fiasp with the comparator. AE, SAE and most frequent > 1% 
AE tables for different groups within the subpopulations divided by treatment groups has been submitted for 
study 3852 and 3853. In total 164 tables have been submitted in this appendix.   
Overall no difference of clinical relevance was noted between Fiasp and NovoRapid  regarding AE, SAE and most 
frequent > 1% AE in the subpopulations of Sex, Age, Race, Ethnicity, BMI, Renal impairment and Hepatic 
impairment at baseline.  
Moderate renal impairment (CLCR ≥30−<60 mL/min) was present in 3% (n=31) of the subjects in study 3852, 
3853 and 4049. As expected no patient was presented with severe renal impairment (CLCR<30 mL/min) since 
impaired renal function was an exclusion criterion in all the therapeutic confirmatory and exploratory trials.  
Among subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline: subjects in the Fiasp group had a lower rate of AEs 
compared to those in the NovoRapid group for T1DM (401 vs. 625 events per 100 PYE). Corresponding results 
for subjects with T2DM showed comparable rates (595 vs. 553 events per 100 PYE). 
Overall, the rates of AEs for subjects with moderate renal impairment, patients with hepatic impairment and 
very elderly (> 75 years) were small and the amounts of AEs were low. Therefore data in these groups should 
be analysed with caution. Exposure of Fiasp in the different age subgroups is presented in Table 36. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In study 3852 (T1DM), the frequency of subjects on potential glucose lowering concomitant treatment was 
46.5%. Concomitant treatment with glucose increasing drugs was used in 39% in this study. 
The frequency of subjects on potential glucose-lowering concomitant treatment was higher in study 3853 
(T2DM), 84% in the Fiasp group compared to 88% in the NovoRapid group. Potential glucose-increasing drugs 
were used in 38% in both groups. 
In total, rates and frequency of AEs were similar between the two formulations in the subgroups of patients on 
or not on potential glucose-lowering or increasing drugs. When comparing the AE profile between these with or 
without respective concomitant glucose-increasing or glucose-decreasing treatment there was a tendency of 
higher rate of AEs in the groups using potentially glucose-lowering or glucose-increasing treatments compared 
to the patients without such treatment. This seem however logical since there is a potential increase comorbidity 
in these groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 116/132 
  
  
In the group of subjects, in study 3852 and 3853, with experience of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes, the four subgroups of patients with and without glucose-lowering drug as well as with and without 
glucose-increasing drugs were studied regarding differences in rate and frequency of severe or BG confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes. No difference in these subgroups between the two formulations regarding this 
parameter could be noted.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall in the diabetes pool, the rates of AEs leading to withdrawal were 2.8 events per 100 PYE for Fiasp and 1.5 
events per 100 PYE for the comparator. The total numbers of events leading to withdrawal were higher in the 
Fiasp group (n=17) compared to the comparator (n=6).  The most commonly SOC was “Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications” with 4 events, “Nervous system disorders” with 4 events followed by “Cardiac 
disorders” and “Metabolism and Nutritional disorders” with 3 events each. The most commonly reported AEs 
leading to withdrawal were hypoglycaemic unconsciousness (1 event in each group) and hypoglycaemia (2 
events for Fiasp, none for comparator). No apparent difference in clustering of events on a SOC, HLGT or PT level 
explaining the difference in rate between the two formulations could be noted.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety information for Fiasp was based on two 26-weeks completed basal-bolus trials in subjects with T1DM 
and T2DM (trials 3852 and 3853). Three other completed therapeutic confirmatory and exploratory trials 4049 
(18 weeks in T2DM), 3931 (6 weeks in T1DM) and 3930 (T1DM) were used to support the safety evaluations 
from the 2 basal-bolus trials. In addition, the use of Fiasp in CSII with pumps was based in another two trials 
(3930 and 3931). 
Common AE 
After 26 weeks of treatment, 73% of the subjects with T1DM (trial 3852) and 53% of the subjects with T2DM 
(trial 3853) experienced adverse events. Besides hypoglycaemia, the overall most common adverse events in 
the pooled analysis were nasopharyngitis (14%), upper respiratory tract infections (6%) and headache (5%).  
Excluding hypoglycaemia, the most frequently reported AEs with possible or probable relation to trial products 
in both groups were wrong drug administered, weight increased and accidental overdose. Increased weight 
could be explained by improved metabolic control. 
Overall, in the individual studies and in the pooled analysis there was no apparent difference of clinical 
importance between Fiasp and the NovoRapid or comparator (including NovoRapid in 93%) respectively. This 
conclusion is based on frequency of adverse events as well as severity, relationship to study drug, and outcome 
of the events. Differences were however noted between type 1 and type 2 diabetes regarding frequency of AEs 
(73% in T1DM vs 53% in T2DM).     
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events occurred in approximately 6% of the subjects with no difference between type 1 and 
Type 2 diabetes. Overall in the diabetes-pool, the rate of SAEs was similar between the two formulations (Fiasp 
15.4 and comparator 15.3 events per 100 PYE). The most comment SAEs was hypoglycaemia and related 
events. Despite these there was no apparent clustering of events in the individual trials. A summary of all SAEs 
in the diabetes pool has not been submitted by the Applicant and is requested. The five cases of deaths, which 
occurred after randomisation to trial drug, seemed not reflect a difference between Fiasp and comparator and do 
not suggest an association to insulin aspart.

Other significant adverse events 
Events of Wrong drug administered or “mix-ups” of pens were noted in >5% in subjects with T1DM (study 
3852). This was also after hypoglycaemia together with accidental overdose the most frequent SAE judged as 
possibly or probably related to trial product in this study. As commented by the Applicant, the possibly 
explanation is that the blinded pen PDS290 prefilled pen-injector used for Fiasp and NovoRapid and the FlexPen 
injector used for insulin detemir had certain similarities.  Medication errors including wrong drug administered is 
characterised as an important potential risk in the RMP. According to information in the RMP a summary usability 
test has been performed in 87 subjects including 21 subjects with colour blindness. The aim was to evaluate if 
the PDS290 Fiasp pen-injector could be differentiated from other relevant products. All the participants in this 
study performed the differentiation tasks without committing any use error or encountering any operational 
difficulties.  
In study including T1DM (study 3852) injection site reactions were noted with a rate of 4.8 and 5.5 per 100 PYE 
in the mealtime and postmeal Fiasp groups compared to 1.6 per 100 PYE in subjects using NovoRapid. This 
provides some support for a causal relation between Fiasp and increased risk for injection site reactions. The 
components of the new formulation might have an increased risk of injection site reactions and also the pooled 
analysis suggests an increased risk of injection site reactions with the new formulation. Injection/infusion site 
reactions are labelled in SmPC section 4.8 as common.  
Analyses of insulin antibodies were performed in patients with T1DM in study 3852. On a group level there 
seemed to be a slight increase of the total anti-insulin antibodies from a mean of 13.8 %B/T at week 0 to 18.0 
%B/T at week 26 over time. This increase was driven by an increase in cross-reacting antibodies to human 
insulin (and not insulin aspart specific antibodies). The increase was noted in all groups without any difference 
between the groups of different formulations. There were no association between higher antibody levels and 
higher or increased HbA1c levels. Neutralizing antibody formation is included as an important potential risk in 
the RMP. Data from the extension of trial 3852 (T1DM) confirmed these findings. 
Overall, there were no clinical difference regarding Systemic allergic reactions between Fiasp and comparator. 
Allergic skin reactions were reported in 1.5% of subjects on Fiasp and 1.4% in the comparator group. 
Hypersensitivity reactions was reported in 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. No anaphylactic reactions were 
reported in the clinical trials in either the Fiasp or comparator group.  
Hypoglycaemia 
A statistical significant difference of the hypoglycaemic rates was seen between NovoRapid and Fiasp mealtime 
groups during the first hour after meal in T1DM (study 3852; estimated treatment ratios: severe or BG 
confirmed 1.48 [1.11; 1.96]95% CI; severe or BG confirmed symptomatic 1.41 [1.05; 1.90]95% CI and ADA 
documented symptomatic 1.40 [1.07; 1.83]95% CI) and during two hours after meal between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid in T2DM (study 3853; estimated treatment ratios: severe or BG confirmed 1.60 [1.13; 2.27]95% CI; 
severe or BG confirmed symptomatic 1.72 [1.19; 2.48]95% CI and ADA documented symptomatic 1.47 [1.08; 
2.01). Over time the difference between the two groups were diluted and after 4-6 hour after meal there were 
no longer any difference between the different formulations.  
A post-hoc analysis demonstrated that the statistical difference in rates of  severe of BG confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes 2 h after meal between the two formulations in trial 3852 (T1DM) was in the group of 
patients dosing according to the pre-defined bolus algorithm (estimated rate ratio 1.91 [1.23;2.99]95% CI). In 
the group of patients following the flexible dosing method of counting carbohydrates there was no statistical 
difference noted the first 2 hours after meal.

EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 118/132 
  
  
Other hypoglycaemic parameters such as accumulation over time and differences in frequency of daytime and 
nocturnal episodes did not differ between the two formulations within subjects with T1DM and T2DM, 
respectively. 
Safety in special populations 
In general there were no differences in AE and SAE rates within the different subgroups analysed within age, 
gender, BMI, race and ethnicity. The rates of AEs for subjects with moderate renal impairment, patients with 
hepatic impairment and very elderly (>75 years) should be analysed with caution since these were small groups 
of patients and the amount of AEs were low. In general, safety in special populations were analysed between the 
two formulations within a certain subgroup.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The Applicant has provided a detailed and careful assessment of hypoglycaemic episodes. Overall, there were no 
significant differences in the frequency or rate of hypoglycaemic episodes between the two formulations in either 
Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. However, a statistically significant difference was noticed in the rate of mealtime 
hypoglycaemic episodes one hour after meal in T1DM and 2 hours after meal in T2DM with higher rates in the 
Fiasp mealtime group compared to the group using NovoRapid.  This likely reflects the PD/PK findings with faster 
action of Fiasp with the new formulation compared to NovoRapid and supports a significant difference of the 
safety profile between the two formulations. 
Apart from differences in the timing of the hypoglycaemic episodes, the data provided did not reveal any 
significant differences of clinical importance in the pattern, proportions and rates of adverse events between 
Fiasp and NovoRapid in either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
Regarding immunogenicity no differences in development of insulin antibodies were detected between the two 
formulations. Further, in contrast to the Applicant the CHMP considers, that a clinically relevant increase of the 
frequency of injection site reactions was noted in T1DM subjects using Fiasp (4.8 and 5.5 per 100 PYE in the 
mealtime and postmeal Fiasp groups) compared to NovoRapid (1.6 per 100 PYE).

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fiasp (insulin aspart) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
2.10.  Assessment for the purpose of Art 82(1) of Reg 726/2006 (duplicates) 
The Applicant believes that there are distinct and clinically relevant differences between the two formulations 
which mandate different prescribing information and trade name for Fiasp, and that these differences include: 
Faster absorption translates into an increased early glucose-lowering effect which in turn results in: 
• 
• 
• 
lower meal-time glucose increments (improved postprandial glucose control) 
greater reduction in HbA1c in T1DM, without increasing dose and without increasing the incidence of

CHMP assessment of the claim 
Clinical relevance of differences in PPG increments between Fiasp and NovoRapid 
The Applicant has provided epidemiological and clinical data aiming to support that PPG is of importance in the 
development of CV complications. Most of these data were generated in the T2DM population. Data has also 
been presented that show that therapy with impact on PPG (i.e. prandial insulin) could have effects on 
myocardial perfusion. Data from the DCCT study in patients with T1DM indicate that an increase in PPG of about 
1 mmol/l may result in an 8 % increased risk for CV events. The changes observed in 1-hour PPG increment was 
of this magnitude for T1DM (-1.18 mmol/l), but less in T2DM (-0.59 mmol/l).  
However, there is still scarce direct evidence from long-term randomised clinical trials that correcting postmeal 
hyperglycaemia directly improves clinical outcomes.  
Clinical relevance of differences in HbA1c reduction between Fiasp and NovoRapid 
It is agreed that with the currently available therapies there is no fixed glycaemic threshold for improvements in 
either microvascular or macrovascular complications. It is also agreed that there is a strong relationship 
between lower HbA1c and a higher risk for hypoglycaemia which limits the possibility to normalise HbA1c. 
However, there is no data to support that an extra reduction of HbA1c of 0.15% (which was even less 
pronounced after 52 weeks treatment) would result in a reduced risk of diabetic micro- or macrovascular 
complications. 
It is acknowledged that the treatment difference is comparable to that observed between insulin analogues and 
human insulin. However, the approval of the analogues was not based on superiority vs human insulin with 
regards to metabolic control and the clinical relevance of this difference was questioned (see NovoRapid SmPC).  
Differences in temporal distribution of hypoglycaemia 
The difference in hypoglycaemia pattern is noted with a higher risk during the first 2 hours with Fiasp compared 
to Novorapid. The CHMP considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant difference between the products. 
This should be clearly reflected in the PI to inform patients and prescribers about the differences in the timing of 
hypoglycaemia. 
CHMP Conclusion regarding the claim 
There is a difference in the PK/PD profile between Fiasp and Novorapid with a ≈5 minute earlier onset of action. 
In the pivotal trials, there was a statistically significant difference in 2 hour PPG increments in favour of Fiasp in 
patients with T1DM; no statistically significant differences were observed in patients with T2DM.  The Applicant 
has provided literature references aiming to support that increased PPG may be of importance in the 
development of CV complications. Further, treatment guidelines from learned societies recommend lowering of 
PPG. However, there is still scarce direct evidence from long-term randomised clinical trials that correcting 
postmeal hyperglycaemia directly improves clinical outcomes, and therefore it is difficult to conclude that the 
documented difference would translate into a clinically relevant benefit.The small difference in reduction of 
HbA1c between Fiasp and NovoRapid observed in patients with T1DM (trial 3852) is not considered to be of 
clinical relevance and no statistically significant difference in HbA1c was shown in patients with T2DM (trial 
3538). 
The difference in hypoglycaemia pattern is noted with a higher incidence during the first 2 hours associated with 
Fiasp compared to Novorapid.  
In conclusion, regarding the applicant’s claim of significant differences in safety or efficacy vs NovoRapid for the 
Assessment report

purpose of Art 82(1) of Reg (EC) No 726/2004 and in view of the EC note on Handling of Duplicate Marketing 
Authorisation Applications Ares(2011)1044649, the CHMP concluded that Fiasp shows significant differences in 
terms of safety due to different excipients versus NovoRapid in view of the difference in the timing of 
hypoglycaemias (associated with differences in PK/PD).

a The application includes data from the initial 26-week treatment period. The additional 26-week treatment period was 
ongoing at the time of the cut-off date for the clinical trials (10 March 2015).  
b In trial 3930, an earlier formulation of Fiasp (FIA(R)) was also evaluated. To keep the focus on the formulation of Fiasp 
intended for the market, efficacy data pertaining to the FIA(R) formulation is not included. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Fiasp is insulin aspart in a new formulation of insulin aspart with two additional excipients. The addition of 
nicotinamide is intended to result in a faster initial absorption following subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The 
addition of L-arginine hydrochloride should support stabilisation of the Fiasp formulation. 
The pharmacodynamic profile was characterised in a program consisting of 9 clinical pharmacology studies, out 
of which 8 were conducted in subjects with T1DM. The studies included 395 randomised subjects and in all 
studies, NovoRapid (insulin aspart) was chosen as comparator. The efficacy of Fiasp was investigated in three 
confirmatory trials including a total of 2068 randomised subjects. Two of the trials were of 26 weeks duration 
and included NovoRapid as the active comparator (trials 3852 (T1DM) and 3853 (T2DM)). The third trial was of 
18 weeks duration and in this trial Fiasp was compared to intensified basal insulin therapy in subjects with T2DM 
(trial 4049). The study program was adequate and well designed. The 26 week extension of trial 3852 has been 
concluded and the results submitted. 
Pharmacodynamic data showed an earlier onset of action with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. In a pooled 
analysis the mean treatment difference was -4.91 min [-6.86; -2.95]95%CI and time to GIRmax occurred 10.5 
min [-16.98; -4.02]95%CI earlier with Fiasp. The glucose-lowering effect during the first 30 minutes (AUCGIR, 
0-30 min) was 51 mg/kg with Fiasp and 29 mg/kg with NovoRapid(Fiasp/NovoRapid, ratio: 1.74 [1.47; 2.10]95% 
CI). The total glucose-lowering effect, as reflected by AUCGIR, 0-12 h, was however comparable between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid in patients with T1DM. The findings were consistent in all the three studies included in the pooled 
analysis. The differences observed in the pharmacodynamic profiles between Fiasp for the 0.2 U/kg dose was 
maintained for the dose range investigated (0.1-0.4 U/kg). 
No difference in the time to onset of action or the maximum effect of Fiasp was observed when 
injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 
In the confirmatory trials, non-inferiority was shown for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid for the primary 
endpoint, mean change from baseline in HbA1c, in T1DM (trial 3852: -0.15 % [-0.23; -0.07] 95%CI) and T2DM 
subjects (trial 3853, -0.02 % [-0.15; 0.10]95%CI). The 95% CI was well within the non-inferiority margin of 
0.4%. In trial 4049, a statistically significant effect of Fiasp, when compared to optimised basal insulin 
treatment, was observed (treatment difference -0.94 % [-1.17; -0.72] 95%CI). These findings were supported by 
the responder analysis where more patients achieved the target of HbA1c <7.0% in the Fiasp meal group 
(33.3 %) than in the NovoRapid group (28.2 %) in trial 3852, whereas there was no difference in the proportion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 124/132 
  
  
 
of patients reaching the HbA1c targets between treatment groups in trial 3853. As expected, in trial 4049, more 
patients achieved the HbA1c targets in the bolus-basal treated group. 
The effect of Fiasp on post-prandial glucose (PPG) increment measured after a standardised meal (meal test) 
and compared to NovoRapid, was a confirmatory secondary endpoint in trials 3852 (T1DM) and 3853 (T2DM). 
There was a statistically significant treatment difference in mean 2-hour PPG increment in subjects with T1DM 
(-0.67 mmol/L [-1.29; -0.04] 95%CI). A statistically significant treatment difference was also observed for the 
mean 1-hour PPG increment in T1DM subjects (-1.18 mmol/L [-1.65; -0.71]95%CI). In T2DM, the estimated 
treatment difference in mean 2-hour PPG increment compared to placebo was Fiaspnot statistically significant 
(-0.36 mmol/L [-0.81; 0.08] 95%CI), whereas a statistically significant treatment difference was observed for the 
mean 1-hour PPG increment (-0.59 mmol/L [-1.09; -0.09]95%CI). 
In trial 3852, the overall rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia episodes were comparable for Fiasp 
(meal) and NovoRapid (estimated rate ratio 1.01 [0.88; 1.15]95%CI). In trial 3853, the overall number of severe 
or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia episodes were higher for Fiasp than for NovoRapid (estimated rate ratio 1.09 
[0.88; 1.36]95%CI). No statistically significant differences were observed. In the pooled analysis, numerically 
slightly more BG confirmed daytime episodes were observed in the Fiasp treated groups and nocturnal BG 
confirmed episodes were numerically slightly less frequent. None of these differences were statistically 
significant.  
As increase in body weight is a known effect of intensified insulin treatment, change in body weight was included 
as a confirmatory secondary endpoint in trials 3852 and 3853.  In trial 3852 (T1DM), mean body weight 
increased slightly from baseline to week 26 in all 3 treatment groups (0.55 kg to 0.70 kg). In trial 3853 (T2DM), 
mean body weight increased with 2.7 kg in both treatment groups.  
In both trials 3852 or 3853, the bolus or basal insulin doses increased during titration-to-target, with no 
apparent difference between treatment arms.  
Data from the long-term extension of trial 3852 (T1DM) show that in both treatment groups, HbA1c increased 
again after the initial decline during the first 26 weeks of treatment. The estimated treatment difference 
(mealtime Fiasp versus NovoRapid) after 52 weeks of randomised treatment was -0.10%-points [-0.19; 
-0.00]95%CI and although statistically significant, the difference was smaller than after 26 weeks. No difference 
in the HbA1c responder endpoints was observed between mealtime Fiasp and NovoRapid. After 52 weeks of 
treatment, the estimated treatment differences for PPG at 1 and 2 hours after start of the meal test only reached 
statistical significance at 1 hour.  
In trial 3852, the effect of post-meal dosing with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid taken before the meal was 
investigated. Non-inferiority to mealtime NovoRapid with regards to mean change from baseline in HbA1c was 
confirmed. The estimated treatment difference was 0.04% [-0.04; 0.12]95%CI. With regards to the mean 2-hour 
PPG increment, a treatment difference of 0.39 [-0.34; 0.93]95%CI in favour of NovoRapid was observed. This was 
also observed for the mean 1-hour PPG increment, where the treatment difference was statistically significant 
and in favour of NovoRapid (0.93 mmol/L [0.46; 1.40]95%CI). 
Two supportive studies were performed using Fiasp in external pump (CSII) in order to support 
recommendations on such use in the SmPC. The effect of Fiasp on 2-hour PPG increment compared to 
NovoRapid was estimated to a treatment difference, -0.99 mmol/L [-1.95; -0.03]95%CI). With regards to other 
parameters for glycaemic control, the two treatments showed comparable results. In the studies, compatibility 
of Fiasp with the pump system was evaluated as the number of confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions. 
There were no microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions in trial 3931, thus supporting 
compatibility for Fiasp with the pump system.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
An adequate number of subjects above the age of 65 (209) were included in the clinical trials; however, the 
experience in patients above the age of 75 (24 patients included in clinical trials) is still limited. There is no 
indication that the effect is dependent on age. The limitation in the data is however reflected in the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There was no difference in overall rate of hypoglycaemic events between the two formulations in either of the 
pivotal trials (see “Beneficial effects” in section above). However, a statistical significant difference was seen 
between NovoRapid and the Fiasp mealtime groups regarding the hypoglycaemic event rates the first hour after 
meal in T1DM (study 3852; estimated treatment ratios: severe or BG confirmed 1.48 [1.11; 1.96]95% CI; 
severe or BG confirmed symptomatic 1.41 [1.05; 1.90]95% CI and ADA documented symptomatic 1.40 [1.07; 
1.83]95% CI)  hypoglycaemic event rates during two hours after meal in T2DM,respectively (study 3853; 
estimated treatment ratios: severe or BG confirmed 1.60 [1.13; 2.27]95% CI; severe or BG confirmed 
symptomatic 1.72 [1.19; 2.48]95% CI and ADA documented symptomatic 1.47 [1.08; 2.01). Over time the 
difference between the two groups were diluted and after 4-6 hour after meal there were no longer any 
difference between the different formulations.  
Analysis of insulin antibodies was performed in patients with T1DM in study 3852. An increase of the total 
anti-insulin antibodies occurred from a mean of 13.8 %B/T at week 0 to 18.0 %B/T at week 26. This increase 
was driven by an increase in cross-reacting antibodies to human insulin (increased from 12.3%/B/T to 
16.2%/B/T) and not insulin aspart specific antibodies (increased from 1.5%/B/T to 1.8%/B/T). The increases 
were noted in all groups without any difference between the groups or different formulations. In study 3852 
there were no association between higher antibody levels and higher or increased HbA1c levels. The data from 
the extension phase of study 3852 confirms the findings. 
Injection/infusion site reactions associated with Fiasp treatment was noted in 2.0% in subjects with type 1 
diabetes (study 3852) and 1% in subjects with Type 2 diabetes (study 3853 and 4049). In the pump studies 
(3930 and 3931) higher frequencies of infusion site reactions was noticed (13% and 8% respectively) however, 
these studies were small and the frequencies corresponded to only two subjects in each study. 
Allergic skin reactions are included among unfavourable effects with Fiasp and were reported in 1.5% of the 
subjects on Fiasp compared to 1.4% in subjects on comparator. These reactions included eczema, rash, rash 
pruritic, urticaria and dermatitis. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 0.2% with Fiasp and 0.1% in subjects 
using the comparator. No anaphylactic reactions were reported in the clinical trials in either the Fiasp or 
comparator group.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In order to, not only avoid symptoms of hyperglycaemia, but also avoid long-term complications of diabetes 
there is consensus that good metabolic control as reflected by HbA1c at least <7% is desirable.  
The data from the pivotal clinical trials show a clinically relevant glucose lowering effect associated with 
treatment with Fiasp as expected considering that the active component is insulin aspart. 
The data provided on Fiasp show that, compared to NovoRapid, there is a shift in the PK/PD profile resulting in 
an earlier onset of the glucose-lowering effect while the total glucose-lowering effect is similar. With respect to 
results in the pivotal phase III studies, statistically significant lowering of the post-prandial glucose (PPG) 
increment with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid in patients with T1DM was documented, as well as a  modest 
decrease in HbA1c (mean treatment difference -0.15%) after 26 weeks . The 52 week data indicate that the 
difference in effect between Fiasp and NovoRapid was less pronounced compared to week 26. 
In patients with T2DM, there was no difference in HbA1c at weeks 26, but a statistically significant reduction in 
1-hour PPG increment was observed. 
There is no consistent data to support that the small differences in HbA1c documented in patients with type 1 
diabetes would translate into a reduced risk in diabetic complications.  The differences in PPG could possibly be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/50360/2017 
Page 128/132 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
of clinical relevance, but it is uncertain if the effect on PPG is an independent marker of risk considering the 
limited effect on HbA1c.  Further, the effect decreased over time. 
With respect to safety, there was a difference in the pattern of hypoglycaemic episodes with a significantly 
higher rate of hypoglycaemia within the first 2 hours after the meal for Fiasp compared to Novorapid. However, 
the overall rate and severity of events was comparable between treatments. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
With the data provided, Fiasp has been well characterised with regards to PK/PD-profile, efficacy and safety and 
the benefit risk balance is considered positive. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fiasp is positive. 
Regarding the applicant’s claim of significant differences in safety or efficacy vs NovoRapid for the purpose of Art 
82(1) of Reg (EC) No 726/2004 and in view of the EC note on Handling of Duplicate Marketing Authorisation 
Applications Ares(2011)1044649, the CHMP concluded by majority that Fiasp shows significant differences in 
terms of safety due to different excipients versus NovoRapid in view of the difference in the timing of 
hypoglycaemias (associated with differences in PK/PD). 
Divergent position regarding the additional claim is appended to this report.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 10 NOVEMBER 2016 
Product name EMEA/H/C/004046/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion for the purpose of Art 
82(1) of Reg (EC) No 726/2004, that Fiasp shows significant differences in terms of safety due to different 
excipients versus NovoRapid, as claimed by the applicant. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Fiasp is submitted as a stand-alone application under Article 8 (3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. This application 
concerns a new formulation of insulin aspart denoted as faster aspart (Fiasp), which contains the same active 
substance and the same strength and pharmaceutical form as NovoRapid, but differs compared to NovoRapid in 
the addition of two excipients (nicotinamide and L-arginine hydrochloride).  
According to the Article 82(1) of Regulation No 726/2004, for medicinal products which contain the same active 
substance and the same strength and pharmaceutical form but differ in the quantity/quality of excipients, 
significant differences in efficacy or safety with the already authorised product (NovoRapid in this case) which 
result from the difference in excipients between the two products need to be demonstrated in order to grant an 
opinion as a stand-alone application. Some differences have been observed in the PK/PD profile between these 
two medicinal products. However, the undersigned Members consider that the documented differences in 
efficacy or safety (i.e.  Changes in glycemic control and/or the timing of hypoglycemias) between Fiasp and 
NovoRapid are not of sufficient clinical relevance to consider Fiasp a different medicinal product.

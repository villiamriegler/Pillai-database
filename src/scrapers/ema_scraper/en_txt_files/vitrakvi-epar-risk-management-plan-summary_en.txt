Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Vitrakvi®
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vitrakvi® (larotrectinib; LOXO-
101). The RMP details important risks of Vitrakvi®, how these risks can be minimised, and 
how more information will be obtained about Vitrakvi®’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
Vitrakvi®’s summary of medicinal product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vitrakvi® should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for Vitrakvi® should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vitrakvi).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Vitrakvi®’s RMP.
The Medicine and what it is used for
Vitrakvi® as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with 
solid tumours that 
 have a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion 
 are locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe 
morbidity and
 have no satisfactory treatment options.
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Vitrakvi®, including its plain-
language summary, can be found in in the EPAR for Vitrakvi®
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vitrakvi).
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Vitrakvi®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about these risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and analysed regularly (e.g., via the periodic safety update report [PSUR]) so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vitrakvi® is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Vitrakvi® are risks that require special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vitrakvi®. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks
Important potential risk: Severe neurologic reactions
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of dizziness, gait 
disturbance, paraesthesia were frequently observed in clinical 
studies.

Important potential risk: Severe drug-induced liver injury
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Elevation of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice were 
reported in clinical trials with Vitrakvi®.
Risk factors and risk groups Patients with impaired liver function at baseline, chronic liver 
conditions, concomitant administration of agents, and medications

Important potential risk: Serious infections secondary to neutropenia
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
In the overall clinical safety database (n=208), a total of 34 SAEs 
from SOC “Infections” were reported, and none were assessed as 
related to study medication. None of the cases of infections were 
reported in combination with neutropenia with the exception of a 
single patient (febrile neutropenia and sepsis).
Neutropenia was observed in ongoing clinical trials in 12% of total 
cases (paediatric patients 32% vs adults 5%).
Risk factors and risk groups Underlying haematological conditions, concomitant administration of 
agents with known haematotoxicity effects, immunosuppression, 
chronic infectous and inflammatory disease, exposure to infectous 
agents. Paediatric patients with complex past medical histories and / 
or neutropenia observable at baseline. Of note, 46% and 37% of so 
far Vitrakvi®-treated patients had received 1 or 2 and at least 3 prior 
systemic therapies, respectively. Hence, a certain effect on baseline 
bone marrow reserve in these patients, in particular in the paediatric 
population, can’t be excluded.

Risk factors and risk groups
Preliminary analysis of safety data on the 16 patients who reached 
the exposure to Vitrakvi® of >2 years, suggests that the majority of 
TEAEs are reported during the first 2 years of exposure.
No further long-term safety data is available.
Long-term exposure may increase the risk of occurrence of 
additional adverse events in adult and paediatric patients exposed to 
Vitrakvi® for a period of longer than 2 years.

Rationale and study objectives
Study ON-TRK, A PrOspective Non-
interventional study in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic TRK 
fusion cancer treated with larotrectinib
To evaluate, under real-world conditions, the safety and 
effectiveness of Vitrakvi® in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic TRK fusion cancer for whom a 
decision to treat with larotrectinib has been made before 
enrollment.
Proposed
Study LOXO-TRK-15002, a Phase 2 
multicentre, open-label study in 
patients 12 years of age and older 
with advanced cancer harbouring a 
fusion of NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3.
Ongoing
Study LOXO-TRK-15003, A Phase 1/2 
study of the oral TRK inhibitor 
LOXO-101 in paediatric patients with 
advanced solid or primary central 
nervous system tumours.
Ongoing
To determine the overall response rate as determined by 
an independent radiology review committee and 
measured by the proportion of subjects with best overall 
confirmed response of complete response or partial 
response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), or Response 
Assessment in Neuro Oncology (RANO) criteria, as 
appropriate, following treatment with Vitrakvi® in subjects 
age 12 and older with an advanced cancer harbouring a 
fusion involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (collectively 
referred to as NTRK gene fusions) for each tumour-
specific disease cohort.
The study will also assess the safety profile and 
tolerability of Vitrakvi® for each tumour-specific disease 
cohort.
Phase I: To determine the safety of oral Vitrakvi®, 
including dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), in paediatric 
patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous 
system (CNS) tumours.
Phase II: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) 
as determined by an independent radiology review 
committee and measured by the proportion of subjects 
with best overall confirmed response of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) by the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1), or Response Assessment in Neuro-
Oncology (RANO) criteria, as appropriate, following 
treatment with Vitrakvi® in paediatric subjects with an 
advanced cancer harbouring a fusion involving NTRK1, 
NTRK2, or NTRK3 (collectively referred to as 
neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor [NTRK] fusions).
In order to confirm the appropriate dose recommended in 
paediatric patients an updated PopPK model based on 
additional PK sampling in paediatric patients between 1 
month and 6 years of age will be created.
To collect long-term use safety and efficacy data in 
paediatric patients.

Study LOXO-TRK-14001, a Phase 1 
multicentre, open-label, dose 
escalation and expansion study in 
adult patients with an advanced solid 
tumour.
Ongoing
Rationale and study objectives
Bayer AG will support a European adult registry through 
the European Reference Network (ERN)-EURACAN, a 
European network focusing on rare adult solid cancers 
(http://euracan.ern-net.eu/)
EURACAN is the ERN for adult rare solid cancers: 1 of 
the 24 ERNs working on a range of thematic issues. The 
ERN for adult rare solid cancers is coordinated by the 
Centre Léon Bérard with the objective to improve the 
quality of care for all European citizens affected by rare 
cancers, while ensuring an optimized and homogeneous 
care and access to innovation, is provided throughout the 
EU member states. This European Reference Network 
EURACAN comprises 66 sites across Europe.
The network aims to reach all EU countries within 5 years 
and develop a referral system to ensure at least 75 % of 
patients are treated in a EURACAN centre. It seeks to 
improve patient survival, produce communication tools in 
all languages for patients and physicians, and develop 
multinational databases and tumour banks.
The EURACAN Genomic registry will be set up to collect 
genomic, clinical and safety data. The current French 
registry (SIRIC-OSIRIS: https://en.e-cancer.fr/OSIRIS-a-
national-data-sharing-project) will be expanded through 
the EURACAN network.
Bayer will receive annual summary results (efficacy and 
safety) in counterpart of its support to the EURACAN 
registry.
To determine the safety of oral Vitrakvi® (also known as 
larotrectinib or LOXO-101), including dose-limiting 
toxicity, in adult patients with an advanced solid tumour; 
to characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, to 
describe antitumor activity, and to identify the maximum 
tolerated dose and/or the appropriate dose of Vitrakvi®
for further clinical investigation.

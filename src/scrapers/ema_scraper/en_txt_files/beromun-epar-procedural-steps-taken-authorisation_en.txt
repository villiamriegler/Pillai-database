Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 24 October 1997. 
During  its  meeting  on  November  1997,  the  CPMP  agreed  that  a  GMP  inspection  of  the 
manufacturing site was not necessary. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  7  January 
1998 (part II), and 21 January 1998 (parts III/IV)  
The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  30 
December 1997. 
During  its  meeting  on  23-25  February  1998,  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of 
questions  to  be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the 
company on 25 February 1998. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 18 August 1998. 
The  Rapporteur  and  the  Co-Rapporteur  circulated  the  joint  response  assessment  report  on  the 
company’s responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 21 October 1998.  
The  applicant  submitted  on  12  November  1998  responses  to  the  outstanding  pharmaceutical 
questions. 
Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur joint assessment report was circulated to all CPMP members on 
13 November 1998. 
An  oral  explanation  was  held  at  the  CPMP  meeting  on  17  November  1998,  to  address  the 
remaining  outstanding  issue  of  the  comparative  survival  of  Beromun/melphalan-ILP  treated 
patients versus patients treated by standard therapy (i.e. amputation or debilitating surgery).  
The CPMP, during their meeting on 17-19 November 1998, considered the responses provided 
by the company and discussed the recommendations presented by the Rapporteur. Amendments 
were discussed to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet texts. 
The  applicant  provided  a  letter  (dated  18  November  1998)  of  undertaking  on  the  follow-up 
measures to be fulfilled as requested by the CPMP. 
During  the  meeting  on  17-19  November  1998  the  CPMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data 
submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for 
granting a Marketing Authorisation for Beromun on 19 November 1998.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major European public health challenge, with a prevalence of 0.4-3.5% in 
different EU member states. It is the most common single cause of liver transplantation in the Union.  
HCV is divided into six major genotypes and numerous subtypes, which are based on phylogenetic relationship. 
Genotype 1 is the most common genotype in Europe, comprising approximately 70 % of infections. Genotype 3 
is second most common, followed by genotype 2. Genotype 4 is predominant in Egypt, the nation in the world 
with the highest documented HCV prevalence. Genotypes 5 and -6 are uncommon in Europe and the US, but are 
more  common  in  South  Africa  and  South-East  Asia,  respectively  (Simmonds  et  al,  Hepatology  2005).  HCV 
genotype does not clearly impact the rate of disease progression. Treatment response, however, with available 
regimens, differs between genotypes. 
The goal of antiviral therapy against HCV is to reach sustained virological response (SVR), which is traditionally 
defined as the absence of quantifiable virus in plasma at least 24 weeks after the end of therapy. However, most 
relapses  occur  within  4  weeks  of  treatment  discontinuation,  and  a  98-99%  concordance  has  been  shown 
between absence of quantifiable virus 12 weeks after therapy, and SVR24 (Florian et al, AASLD 2011). Therefore 
the absence of measurable virus 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) is presently accepted by European 
and US regulators as the primary endpoint in clinical trials. Though occasional late relapses occur, in general the 
durability of SVR has been amply demonstrated (see e.g., Ng and Saab, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011). 
Up until the European commission approval of sofosbuvir, all approved therapeutic regimens for hepatitis C virus 
infection contained an interferon. For the treatment of genotype 1 infection, the addition of either one of the NS 
3/4A  protease  inhibitors  telaprevir  or  boceprevir,  approved  in  2011,  was  considered  standard-of-care.  For 
genotypes other than -1 there were no direct-acting antivirals (DAA) approved, bi-therapy with pegIFN/RBV 
being  the  standard.  Interferon-based  therapies  are  associated  with  potentially  serious  side  effects  that  are 
important in limiting real life effectiveness. These include a risk of hepatic decompensation and septicaemia in 
patients  with  advanced  liver  disease,  as  well  as  bone  marrow  suppression.  Also,  there  are  psychiatric  side 
effects such as depression, which considerably limits eligibility to treatment in the target population (see e.g., 
Bini et al, Am J Gastroenterol 2005). 
Recent  years  have  seen  a  very  rapid  drug  development  for  hepatitis  C.  The  aforementioned  approval  of 
sofosbuvir was followed by the approval of other medicinal products for the hepatitis C virus infection. There are 
numerous further medicinal products in the pipeline, and the anticipation is that within short interferon-free 
therapies  with  very  high  antiviral  efficacy  will  be  approved  and  recommended  for  most  or  all  patients  with 
hepatitis C, regardless of genotype and clinical status. Despite the very rapid development of new therapies, 
including interferon-free regimens, CHMP considered at the time of this application that the unmet medical need 
for many European patients with hepatitis C infection still persisted. 
The applicant has developed an IFN-free regimen containing 3 DAAs with distinct mechanisms of action and 
non-overlapping resistance profiles for the treatment of chronic HCV infection: 
• 
paritaprevir (ABT-450) is a nonstructural protein [NS] 3/4A protease inhibitor, which is necessary for 
the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 8/150 
 
  
  
NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication.  ABT-450 is metabolized primarily by 
cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  3A4  and  is  dosed  with  ritonavir  (r),  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor  used  as  a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer  in order to achieve efficacious exposures (the combination of ABT-450 and 
ritonavir is denoted ABT-450/r); 
•  Ombitasvir (ABT-267) is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral replication; 
•  Dasabuvir (ABT-333) is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded 
by the NS5B gene. 
Viekirax contains ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir.

(PVC/PE/PCTFE-Al) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Ombitasvir 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance ombitasvir is dimethyl([(2S,5S)-1-(4-tert-butylphenyl)pyrrolidone- 
-2,5-diyl]bis{benzene-4,1-diylcarbamoyl(2S)pyrrolidine-2,1-diyl[(2S)-3-methyl-1-oxobutane-1,2-diyl]}) 
biscarbamate hydrate, corresponding to the molecular formula C50H67N7O8 • 4.5 H2O and has a relative 
molecular mass 975.20 (hydrate) and 894.11 (anhydrate). It has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 9/150 
 
 
 
  
  
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, 1H- and 
13C-NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, UV as well as from solid form screening studies (X-ray powder 
diffraction, DSC, TGA, DVS, microscopy and laser diffraction all of which support the chemical structure. 
It appears as a white to light yellow to light pink crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in 0.1 N HCl pH 1, 
and sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8, soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in VP-dimer: VA-dimer. The 
dissociation constant of ombitasvir was determined to be pKa = 2.5 and its distribution coefficient (n-octanol/pH 
7.4) LogD was determined to be 7.4. 
Ombitasvir has six chiral centres. Enantiomeric impurity is ensured through starting material specifications and 
in-process controls. Multiple crystal forms of ombitasvir have been discovered as a result of polymorphic screen 
studies. Four structurally distinct forms most relevant to ombitasvir development and manufacture have been 
reported. The active substance is consistently manufactured as Form I. 
The active substance is packaged in double plastic bag which complies with the relevant EC regulations and Ph. 
Eur. requirements. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ombitasvir is manufactured by a seven-stage process followed by purification and drying. Reprocessing if 
needed, is foreseen and described. Intermediate products are defined. The proposed five starting materials are 
also well-defined and considering the overall control strategy over the synthetic process are considered 
acceptable.  
The  synthesis  has  been  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  and  in-process 
controls (IPCs) have been reported and are considered satisfactory. Changes of the synthetic process during 
development have also been reported in sufficient detail. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  and  degradation  products  have  been 
characterised  and  toxicologically  qualified  as  appropriate.  The  different  stereoisomeric  impurities  have  been 
described  and  their  origin  and  fate  have  been  adequately  discussed.  The  various  controls  either  during 
manufacturing or in the final active substance are considered adequate. 
An adequate control strategy for any potential genotoxic impurities and their precursors has been established 
based on control of material attributes (input materials and intermediates), or downstream process due to their 
reactivity, or testing at appropriate limits by release specification of ombitasvir active substance as per ICH M7. 
Process  validation  and/or  evaluation  has  been  completed  and  showed  that  the  process,  operated  within 
established  parameters,  can  reproducibly  produce  the  active  substance  meeting  its  predetermined 
specifications and quality attributes.

Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  and  colour  (visual), 
clarity  and  colour  of  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (IR,  HPLC),  crystal  form  (XRPD),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC,  GC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  water  content  (Ph. Eur.)  and  microbiological 
quality (Ph. Eur.). Impurities, including potential genotoxic ones, and heavy metals are sufficiently controlled 
either by suitable specification or they are adequately controlled upstream in the process, in which case they are 
not included in the active substance specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. 
Batch  analysis  data  for  three  full  scale  and  six  smaller  scale  batches  of  ombitasvir  manufactured  with  the 
proposed  process  in  two  different  sites  and  used  in  clinical,  primary  stability  and  process  validation  were 
provided. Additional data were provided for five batches manufactured with the slightly different processes used 
during development were also submitted. 
The submitted batch analysis data confirm that the manufacture is sufficiently robust and provide reassurance 
that the process yields active substance of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification.  
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial size batches of active substance from a different manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH and for up to 
six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In 
addition, data on four full scale batches from the proposed manufacturer were also provided for under the same 
long term and accelerated conditions for three months (study ongoing). Stress studies have been performed on 
one batch at elevated temperature (50 °C/75 % RH and 80 °C, 80 °C/75 % RH respectively), light, UV radiation 
stress and solution stress (acid, base and peroxide). 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, identification, impurities, water content, crystal form 
and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures for assay and impurities have been validated and shown 
to be stability indicating. All results for all parameters at long term and accelerated storage conditions meet the 
proposed acceptance criteria. Ombitasvir was shown stable to ICH photostability conditions. 
Impurities results for the stress stability samples indicated that ombitasvir is potentially susceptible to acid, 
base, oxidative and UV radiation degradation, but not to heat and/or moisture degradation. The assay results of 
the stress stability samples were determined for mass balance purposes and there are no significant 
unaccounted for degradation products. 
Paritaprevir 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance paritaprevir is (2R,6S,12Z,13aS,14aR,16aS)-N- 
(Cyclopropylsulfonyl)-6-{[(5-methylpyrazin-2-yl)carbonyl]amino}-5,16-dioxo-2-(phenanthridin-6-yloxy) 
1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,13a,14,15,16,-16atetradecahydrocyclopropa[e]pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4] 
diazacyclopentadecine-14a(5H)-carboxamide dihydrate, corresponding to the molecular formula 
C40H43N7O7S•2H2O and has a relative molecular mass 801.91 (dihydrate) or 765.88 (anhydrous). It has the 
following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 11/150 
 
 
 
  
  
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, 1H- and 
13C-NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, all of which support the chemical structure. 
It appears as a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in 0.01 N HCl pH 2 and sodium 
phosphate buffer pH 6.8, slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in VP-dimer: VA-dimer. The dissociation 
constant of paritaprevir was determined to be pKa = 4.6 and its distribution coefficient (n-octanol/pH 6.8) LogD 
was determined to be 3.1. 
Paritaprevir has five chiral centres and one Z-double bond within the ring structure. Enantiomeric impurity is 
ensured through starting material specifications and appropriate in-process controls.  
Multiple crystal forms of paritaprevir have been discovered. The three structurally distinct forms most relevant 
for the paritaprevir manufacture were identified. The drug substance is manufactured consistently as Form II. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bags which comply with the relevant EC regulations 
and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Paritaprevir is manufactured by a six-stage process consisting of nine chemical reactions. The proposed four 
starting materials also well defined and are considered acceptable taking into account the overall control 
strategy over the synthetic process. The raw materials used in the synthesis and intermediates are well defined 
and controlled by suitable methods and specifications. The synthesis has been described in sufficient detail and 
critical process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) have been reported and are considered satisfactory. 
The chirality of paritaprevir is established in the intermediates and the starting materials. The combination of 
starting material and intermediate specification, process controls, and the active substance specifications 
provide the necessary control for stereoisomerism in the paritaprevir active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities and degradation products have been 
characterised and toxicologically qualified as appropriate. There are multiple potential genotoxic impurities 
(GTIs) that could be formed in the paritaprevir active substance manufacturing process. These GTIs and their 
precursors are controlled through material attributes (input materials and intermediates), processing 
conditions, or are tested and controlled in the active substance at release. 
Process validation and/or evaluation have been completed showing that the process, operated within 
established parameters, can produce reproducibly a drug substance meeting its predetermined specifications 
and quality attributes.

Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  and  colour  (visual), 
clarity  and  colour  of  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (IR,  HPLC),  crystal  form  (XRPD),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC, GC), residual solvents (GC), particle size (laser diffraction), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. 
Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities, including potential genotoxic ones, are sufficiently controlled either by suitable specification in line 
with ICH M7 guideline where appropriate. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. 
Since the chirality of the active substance is controlled by appropriate material specifications, it is considered 
acceptable not to include a test for the undesired enantiomer in the paritaprevir specification. 
Batch analysis results are provided for five full scale batches from the proposed manufacturer according to the 
commercial manufacturing process. Results for seven other development batches according to the commercial 
process but manufactured at a different site were also provided. In addition, five more development batches 
manufactured at the development site according to slightly different processes were provided as well.   
All batch analysis results were presented and were compliant with the specifications valid at the time of testing, 
confirming that the manufacture is sufficiently robust and produces active substance of consistent quality.  
Stability 
Stability  data  on  four  primary  stability  batches  (two  commercial  and  two  smaller  scale)  of  active  substance 
stored in the intended commercial package for twelve months under long term conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH and 
for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In 
addition, one full scale batch was stored at 50 °C/75 % RH for a month. The primary stability batches, for which 
there are available long-term 12 months stability data, were manufactured by the same six-stage process with 
slight  operating  differences  and  slightly  different  specifications  than  the  current  commercial  process. 
Nevertheless, the data from these batches are considered relevant for stability. 
Data from another three commercial scale batches from the commercial site and process were also presented for 
three months under long term conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH and for three months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 °C/75 % RH. 
No meaningful changes were observed on stability. The stability data from the commercial site and process are 
comparable to the stability data from the primary stability batches. The data generated at 50°C/75% RH support 
possible temperature excursions during shipping of up to 50°C for 1 month. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Paritaprevir was shown to be 
sensitive to ICH photostability conditions. Additionally, the active substance was exposed to acid, base, 
oxidation, heat, heat with moisture, metal stress and light (UV light) stress conditions. Paritaprevir was found 
sensitive to degradation by acid, base, oxidation, heat, and metals, but not to heat and moisture stress.  
Based  on  presented  stability  data,  the  proposed  re-test  period  and  storage  conditions  for  paritaprevir  are 
acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate release film-coated tablet as a 
fixed combination  containing 12.5 mg/ 75 mg /50 mg of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir respectively per 
tablet. The physicochemical properties of the active substances, formulation screening, processing 
considerations, and the results of biostudies drove the selection of formulation and finished product 
manufacturing process. Considering that all three active substances are insoluble in aqueous media they are 
individually converted to amorphous materials in order to enhance their bioavailability via a specific 
manufacturing process. Each active substance is blended with extrusion excipients and extruded individually 
into three separate finished product intermediates. These extrudate intermediates (EI) are amorphous solid 
dispersions of each active substance in polymer/surfactant matrices manufactured by hot melt extrusion (HME). 
Amorphous solid dispersions are an effective method to improve the oral absorption of poorly soluble drugs. The 
basis of this improvement is the ability to form and sustain supersaturated solutions of the amorphous drug 
compared to the crystalline form. Pharmaceutical development was largely focused on the three EIs that 
comprise Viekirax tablets. The same key design requirements were identified for the three extrudates: 
bioavailability, manufacturability and storage stability. 
Ombitasvir Extrudate Intermediate 
An amorphous solid dispersion (SD) approach was employed to increase the low aqueous solubility and 
bioavailability of ombitasvir. In early development the amorphous solid dispersion formulation was 
manufactured using solvent based spray drying. However, a solvent free process was preferred for 
manufacturing amorphous SD and therefore a hot melt extrusion (HME) process was developed. The relative 
bioavailability of tablets containing ombitasvir SD manufactured by spray drying versus hot melt extrusion was 
investigated in an in vivo study. The results showed that both the Cmax and AUC from the HME formulation were 
substantially higher compared to the spray drying formulation.  
Ombitasvir undergoing the HME process is converted from Form I to amorphous. Ombitasvir EI has shown no 
re-crystallisation of during long-term storage, ensuring crystals will not form in the extrudate under normal 
storage conditions. Epimerisation of the ombitasvir active substance has not been observed on stability. The 
finished product manufacturing process involves operations that are not expected to induce epimerisation of any 
of the chiral centres in ombitasvir. 
The choice of excipients has been sufficiently justified and their function has been explained. 
Paritaprevir Extrudate Intermediate 
Paritaprevir exhibits very poor aqueous solubility over the physiological pH range. Therefore a similar approach 
as for the ombitasvir extrudate was followed. The initial spray dried SD was soon replaced by HME. The relative 
bioavailability of tablets containing paritaprevir SD manufactured by spray drying versus HME was investigated 
with co-dosed ritonavir in an in vivo study. The results showed that both the Cmax and AUC from the HME 
formulation were substantially higher compared to the spray drying formulation. During the extrudate 
manufacture paritaprevir Form II dehydrates to an amorphous form without residual crystallinity. Accelerated 
stability studies of the paritaprevir EI have shown no re-crystallisation during long-term storage, ensuring 
crystals will not form in the extrudate under normal storage conditions. Paritaprevir from two sources was 
evaluated during the extrudate process development. The particle size distribution (PSD) was found to affect the 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 15/150 
 
  
  
required energy to uniformly distribute the amorphous dehydrated material, therefore relevant PSD limit has 
been set for the active substance. 
Ritonavir Extrudate Intermediate 
Solubility studies for ritonavir demonstrated that amorphous ritonavir can form supersaturated solutions with 
peak solubility values as high as 10-fold greater than those from crystalline ritonavir. Hence this observation led 
similarly to the development of an SD manufactured by HME as with the other two substances. The same carrier 
(copovidone) but a different surfactant/plasticiser is employed. The ritonavir EI used in the Viekirax tablets is 
the same as the one used in commercial ritonavir tablets (Norvir). 
The choice and functions of the excipients used in Viekirax tablets have been discussed and justified. All 
excipients are pharmacopoeial and safe in the proposed concentrations. The oral use of copovidone in the 
amount contained in the Viekirax tablets is considered safe considering the long-term use of Norvir film-coated 
tablets containing also the same copovidone-based extrudate with a maximum daily dosage of 12 tablets. The 
compositions of all the tablet formulations used during product development have been presented. All pivotal 
clinical studies have been performed with the commercial formulation. 
Dissolution Method  
The HME formulation releases the active substances through a surface erosion mechanism. The individual EIs 
gave similar in vitro drug release rates as the extrudate surfaces erode. Although the in vitro drug release profile 
of the tablets is slow due to the surface erosion mechanism, the tablets gave in vivo performance equivalent to 
that of known immediate release formulations. The dissolution methods used for single entity paritaprevir, 
ritonavir and ombitasvir formulations and paritaprevir/ritonavir tablet formulations used in the clinical trials 
were developed for each respective formulation and were presented. The proposed dissolution method was 
developed and optimised for the final Viekirax product. Sink conditions were achieved for ombitasvir and 
paritaprevir. For ritonavir only the maximum kinetic solubility was achieved. Although this value does not meet 
the compendial definition of sink conditions, it does provide sensitivity to crystalline active substance. No 
gastrointestinal pH was found where the concurrent solubility of all three substances was adequate in the 
absence of surfactant, therefore a surfactant, used in previous ritonavir-containing HME products, was added. 
The medium pH was selected based on the observed in vivo Tmax for each of the three substances. Considering 
the low solubility of the three substances, the test conditions are acceptable. 
It has been demonstrated that the dissolution method is discriminative, vis-à-vis crystalline content in the 
extrudates and with respect to the surfactants in the extrudate formulations. In combination with controls for 
the CQAs of the individual extrudates, the proposed dissolution test is suitable as a quality control test for 
release and stability testing to ensure the in vivo performance of the Viekirax film-coated tablets. 
A systematic approach was taken to develop the Viekirax tablets formulation and manufacturing process. The 
quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as follows: an oral dosage form containing 12.5 mg/ 75 mg /50 
mg of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir in a fixed dose combination of acceptable appearance, meeting the 
relevant compendial requirements for this pharmaceutical form, comprised of known excipients and stable in 
different climatic zones. An initial list of product critical quality attributes (CQAs) was generated based on the 
QTPP. Subsequently, a systematic evaluation, understanding, and refinement of the manufacturing process 
were carried out using design of experiments, statistical analysis, simulations, and mathematical models were 
undertaken to define the relationship of the material attributes and process parameters to the product CQAs. 
After determining the CQAs, critical process parameters (CPPs), and in-process controls (IPCs), the control 
strategy was defined to ensure final product quality. A final risk assessment was then completed to demonstrate 
risks previously identified are mitigated using the proposed control strategy. 
The proposed commercial formulation is the same as the one used in all Phase III clinical studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 16/150 
  
  
The packaging material of Viekirax is PVC/PE/PCTFE –Alu blister which complies with the relevant EU 
regulations. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Because Viekirax film-coated tablets include three different active substances, all of which are individually 
converted to amorphous via HME, the manufacturing process for the tablets is complex and consists of several 
unit operations. The individual extrudate intermediates (EI) are prepared separately but are milled and blended 
together. The manufacturing unit operations developed for Viekirax film-coated tablets are: blending I, 
extrusion, milling, blending II, tableting, and coating. The critical process parameters and in-process controls 
have been presented and are justified in relation to how the quality attributes are affected. The designed control 
strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a drug product that meets the defined 
criteria for all CQAs. Holding times for the three EI have been established based upon results from appropriately 
designed studies. 
Process validation has been completed for the ombitasvir and paritaprevir EI as well as for the finished tablets 
film-coated tablets. The process validation for these three materials was completed at the largest claimed batch 
sizes. The ritonavir EI process has been validated before commercialisation of Norvir. Taking also into account 
the applicant’s and the proposed manufacturer’s extensive manufacturing experience with this type of 
formulations and processes which are also employed for other authorised products such as Kaletra and Norvir it 
is accepted that this complex process has been overall satisfactorily validated. 
In conclusion it is considered that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to provide assurance that the process 
produces the finished product Viekirax film-coated tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated 
specification. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for: appearance 
(visual), identification of ombitasvir (HPLC, TLC), identification of paritaprevir (HPLC, TLC), identification of 
ritonavir (HPLC, TLC),  assay of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir  (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), dissolution for ombitasvir, paritaprevir and 
ritonavir  (Ph. Eur.- HPLC) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur).  
Genotoxic impurities are controlled via incoming active substances and compendial excipient controls and 
therefore it is acceptable that the tablets will not be tested for genotoxic impurities. The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data for one development scale and seven commercial scale batches were presented. All batches 
are representative of the commercial formula and process. All batches meet the commercial specification limits. 
Stability of the product 
Primary stability batches of finished Viekirax tablets include three batches of the formulation proposed for 
marketing. Each of the primary stability batches was manufactured at the proposed site for commercial 
manufacture of the product, at approximately 30 to 50 % of the largest proposed commercial scale. In these 
primary stability studies the three used EI have been previously stored from 1-4 months. In further supportive 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 17/150 
 
 
 
  
  
stability studies for two batches (one pilot and one 50 % of full scale) of tablets, the three extrudates have been 
stored for up to 14 months before the tablets’ manufacture.  
The primary stability batches have been stored for twelve months at 30 °C/75 % RH; and for six months at 
40 °C/75 % RH. The two supportive batches have been stored under the same conditions for six months. 
Parameters tested were description, assay, degradation products, dissolution and water content. At selected 
intervals the material is also tested for crystallinity and microbial quality. The analytical methods were shown to 
be stability indicating. No significant changes were observed for any of the tested parameters. In addition to the 
real time stability data, statistical evaluations (linear model) to predict the stability at the end of the proposed 
shelf life have been provided and accepted. Temperature excursion (at 5 °C, at 50 °C and -20 °C)  and cycling 
stability (in conditions varying from -20 °C to 30 °C/75 % RH and 50 °C/75 % RH to 30 °C/75 % RH) studies 
were provided for the same primary stability batches. The samples were tested for description, assay, 
degradation products, dissolution and water content. The tablet temperature excursion stability data support 
total temperature excursions of up to 28 days at 40°C and/or up to 28 days at 50°C. The stability data also 
supports temperature excursions of up to 12 months at 2 to 8 °C and up to 14 days at −20 °C. 
Additional stability data include ICH photostability, open dish stability study, and forced degradation stress 
testing by tablets to oxidation, hydrolytic, and in the solid state, heat, heat and moisture and UV light stress. 
Tablets are not sensitive to light.  
In addition holding times for the three EI have been established based upon results from appropriately designed 
stability studies. 
Based on the presented data and statistical evaluation, the shelf life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
Viekirax film coated tablets do not contain any excipient or any materials used in the manufacturing process that 
is of animal and/or human origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the three active substances has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The chirality and potential epimerisation of the new active substances ombitasvir and 
paritaprevir have been sufficiently investigated. Ritonavir complies with the Ph. Eur. specifications. An adequate 
control strategy in this respect has been set throughout both the active substances and the finished product 
manufacture.  The finished product pharmaceutical development was focused on increasing the bioavailability of 
the active substances in view of their extremely low aqueous solubility. This was achieved by the choice of 
excipients in the formulation and via a specific complex manufacturing process which was based on the 
applicant’s previous experience with other ritonavir containing marketed products. The function and choice of 
excipients in the formulation was sufficiently justified and the manufacturing process adequately validated. A 
systematic approach was followed to identify the QTPP and subsequently determining the CQAs, critical process 
parameters (CPPs), in-process controls, thus establishing a control strategy able to ensure final product quality. 
The development of the dissolution method, appropriate to test the three active substances simultaneously, has 
been clearly described and is considered suitable as a quality control test to ensure consistent batch to batch in 
vivo performance of the Viekirax film-coated tablets. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined

in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology  
ABT-450 (paritaprevir) and ABT-267 (ombitasvir) have nanomolar to subnanomolar activity against genotypes 
1  and  4)  (see  further  below,  section  on  pharmacodynamics).  ABT-450  did  not  affect  human  proteases 
significantly.  Low  cytotoxicity  and  low  activity  against  other  virus  also  indicate  high  selectivity  against  HCV 
infected  cells.  The  four  most  significant  metabolites  of  ABT-267;  M23,  M29,  M36  and  M37  were  at  least 
78000-fold less active than ABT-267 against the genotype 1a and 1b replicons in vitro and thus concluded not 
to be pharmacologically active.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Receptor screening: ABT-450 gave a weak to moderate effect on the A1, AT1, AT2, CCKB(CCK2), M1 and EP4 
receptors and the Na+ channel (site 2). These effects are not likely to be of clinical significance considering that 
the in vitro screening was performed at 10 µM and that the reported Cmax plasma level of for ABT-450 is 1.9 µM. 
The only significant effect (defined as an inhibition higher than 50%) was detected on the δ-opioid receptor δ2 
(DOP), where a 77% inhibition was seen at 10 µM, indicating an IC50 < 10 µM. Opioid receptors are targets for 
both  pain  and  alcohol  abuse  and  are  also  reported  to  be  involved  in  immune  function  and  mood.  The 
DOR2-selective antagonist NTB has e.g. been reported to be effective at reducing ethanol consumption in mice 
(Biol Psychiatry. Oct 15, 2009; 66(8): 777–784.) The possible significance of the effects seen on the δ2-oipioid 
receptor has not been discussed by the applicant. However, considering the low distribution to the brain and that 
ABT-450 is a substrate for both MDR-1 (PgP) and BCRP and also have a high plasma protein binding (>95%), an 
interaction with the δ-opioid receptor δ2 (DOP) is considered to be unlikely. This conclusion is also supported by 
the absence of any CNS effects in the safety pharmacology and repeat dose toxicology studies performed. 
A possible interaction at high plasma levels of metabolites of ABT-267/ombitasvir with P2Y (IC50~10µM), the 
DA transporter (IC50=3.2 µM) and the Cl- channel (IC50=1.5 µM) was detected in the in vitro pharmacological 
screen performed, while no significant interactions between ABT-267 and the targets studied were detected. 
M23 also displaced binding at the A3 (51.9%); BZDperipheral (61.2%); CB1 (55%); D1 (46.3%); MT1 (49%); 
µ  (44.1%);  5HT5a  (62.2%);  sigma  (51.8%);  GR  (76.8%)  receptors  and  Na+-channel  (53.4%)  at  10  µM. 
However, none of these effects are considered to be clinically relevant based on the low plasma Cmax levels 
reported for ABT-267 (0.14 µM) and its metabolites. ABT-267, M23, M29, M36 and M37 are reported to be the 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014

main  components  in  plasma  after  a  single  dose  of  ABT-267  alone,  representing  about  93%  of  total  plasma 
radioactivity, 52% of which is contributed to ABT-267 and 33% to the two major metabolites M29 and M36. 
The high human plasma protein binding of ABT-450 (97-98.5%) and ABT-267 and its major metabolites (>99% 
and 98.4-99.3%, respectively) further support the conclusion that the effects seen in the in vitro screens are not 
likely to be of clinical significance.  
Safety pharmacology  
CNS: ABT-450 in combination with Ritonavir (15mg/kg) did not give any CNS/neurobehavioral effects in rats at 
doses up to and including 30 mg/kg. No effects were seen on spontaneous locomotor activity (Activity Meter), 
Ethanol  Interaction  Test  (sleep  induction)  or  Pro-/Anticonvulsant  Effects  (Pentylenetetrazole  (PTZ)  Seizure 
Tests), while excitatory effects were seen in the Irwin Test at 100 and 300 mg/kg and induced stereotypies, 
salivation and mydriasis at 300 mg/kg. Neurobehavioral observation (functional observational battery; FOB) did 
not detect any effects of ABT-450 in combination with Ritonavir (15mg/kg) which did not give any effects in rats 
at doses up to and including 500 mg /kg, a dose associated with plasma levels of 2.60 ± 1.40 μg/mL ABT-450 
at 3 hours and 4.92±2.38 μg/mL at 6 hours. 
ABT-267  did  not  have  an  effect  on  locomotor  activity  in  rats  at  oral  doses  ≤30mgkg  and  Neurobehavioral 
observation in mice (functional observational battery; FOB) did not detect any effects of ABT-267 at doses up to 
and including 120 mg/kg. (A dose of 120 mg/kg gave plasma Cmax levels of 5.42 µg/mL in another study in 
mice.) 
Cardiovascular: No inhibition of hERG was seen at concentrations up to 7-20 µM (5-18% inhibition). Since Cmax 
plasma  concentrations  in  the  clinic  of  ABT-450  is  reported  to  be  1.47  μg/mL  (~2  µM)  an  effect  on  hERG  is 
considered not likely to be of clinical significance, especially if the high protein binding (fu 1.5-3%) is also taken 
into account. A modest dose-dependent prolongation of the QT-interval was seen in Pentobarbital-anesthetized 
dogs given 30-minute intravenous infusions of ABT-450 and plasma levels of 2.6 ± 0.3 to 66 ± 4.1 μg/mL. A 
modest decrease in mean arterial pressure and tachycardia was also seen in a pilot study in anesthetized rats. 
No effects on blood pressure or any of the ECG parameters (HR, RR, PR, QRS, QT) measured were detected in 
conscious Beagle dogs at plasma exposures ≤ 96.9 ± 22.5 μg/mL (100 mg/kg). 
ABT-267 did not have any effects on hERG in vitro and IC50 was indicated to be higher than 5µM (4.6 µg/mL). 
In  a  GLP  study  the  only  tested  concentration  43  ng/mL  was  also  negative.  No  cardiovascular  effects  were 
detected in anesthetized beagle dogs administrated ABT-267 via intravenous infusion at plasma levels ≤0.483 
± 0.034 μg/mL. In conscious dogs no effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or any of the ECG parameters were 
detected and there was no indication of QT or QTc prolongation at any of the doses tested with plasma levels up 
to 2.62 ± 0.351 μg/mL. 
Taken together, obtained data thus suggest that neither ABT-450 nor ABT-267 have a potential for adverse 
QT-effects. This conclusion is also supported by the negative results obtained in a clinical thorough QT study 
performed using the combination of ABT-450, ritonavir, ABT-267, and ABT-333. 
Respiratory: No systematic or substantial changes in the respiratory measures tested (respiratory rate, tidal 
volume, and minute volume) were detected in conscious Sprague Dawley rats exposed to ABT-450/ritonavir at 
the maximal plasma exposures achieved (0.7-1.0 μg/mL) which were below or similar to the reported human 
plasma Cmax level of 1.5 µg/mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 20/150 
 
  
  
ABT-267 did not give any effects on respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume at doses up to 120 mg/kg 
in mice. (A dose of 120 mg/kg gave plasma Cmax levels of 5.42 µg/mL in mice in another study.) 
Gastrointestinal Tolerability: ABT-450 was non-emetic at 7.5 and 25 mg/kg and caused emesis in one in six 
ferrets at 75 mg/kg (8.15 ± 4.47 μg/mL; at 3h). No effects were seen in GI transit in rats at plasma exposures 
≤ 8.15 ± 4.47 μg/mL; at 1.75h. 
No GI-effects of ABT-267 were either detected (no dose dependent increased incidence of emesis or nausea in 
ferrets and no effect on Gi-transit in rats) at doses up to 15 mg/kg. 
Ritonavir 
Safety pharmacology studies performed with ritonavir in 1993 and 1997 were also included in this submission. 
These studies are considered to be of limited value and to be superseded by the long clinical experience with 
co-administration of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Checkerboard assays were performed to investigate whether combinations of ABT-450 with IFN-α, ABT-333, 
ABT-267,  ribavirin  and  ritonavir,  or  ABT-267  with  ribavirin,  IFN-α  or  ABT-333,  were  additive,  synergistic  or 
antagonistic.  These  combinations  demonstrated  mostly  additive  inhibition  with  occasional  synergism  or 
antagonism at low concentrations. Antagonism did not exceed ~15% from additivity. (For the combination of 
ABT-267 with ribavirin or IFN-α, the magnitude of the deviation was not given.) 
Treatment of replicon cells with the combination of ABT-450 and IFN-α for three weeks resulted in greater HCV 
RNA decline than treatment with ABT-450 alone. 
After  treatment  of  replicon  cells  genotype  1a  with  the  “three-drug  combination”  (ABT-450  +  ABT-267  + 
ABT-333) for three weeks no colonies or only 1 colony survived. After treatment with two-drug combinations, 
still resistance associated variants could survive. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introductory comment regarding data on ritonavir 
ABT-450 is co-dosed with ritonavir, a potent CYP and efflux transport inhibitor in order to mitigate the high 
first-pass  and  hepatic  elimination.  The  applicant  has  therefore  included  several  previously  performed 
pharmacokinetic  studies  on  ritonavir  in  the  dossier  in  support  to  the  present  application.  However,  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  ritonavir  is  considered  to  be  well  known  and  established  knowledge  and  the 
pharmacokinetic data on ritonavir per se is therefore not included in the overall conclusions on pharmacokinetics 
presented below. 
Species used 
Mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and dog have been used for pharmacokinetic investigations on ABT-450 (alone and 
in combination with ritonavir) and ABT-267. Due to low solubility and low bioavailability several studies on the 
effect of different formulations have been performed. 
Absorption 
ABT-450  has  a  moderate  apparent  permeability  in  vitro  and  is  indicated  to  be  a  substrate  for  the  efflux 
transporters P-gp (MDR-1) and BCRP. Oral absorption in rats is low, only 15% and increased to 51%  when 
ABT-450 and ritonavir were co-dosed. The improved absorption is likely due to inhibition of both CYP mediated 
first-pass metabolism and intestinal efflux transporters by ritonavir.

The ABT-450 pharmacokinetics is characterized by short plasma elimination half-lives after intravenous dosing, 
which ranged from 0.4 hr in rat and monkey to 1.2 hr in dog.  Volumes of distribution were low to moderate in 
all species, with values ranging from 0.15 L/kg in dog to 0.98 L/kg in rat.  Plasma clearance values were high in 
rat (3.0 L/hr•kg) and monkey (1.9 L/hr•kg), but lower in dog (0.11 L/hr•kg). 
ABT-450 oral systemic bioavailability was non-detectable in rat and monkey, and averaged 41% in dog. 
ABT-267 has a low to moderate apparent permeability in vitro and data from cells over-expressing MDR-1 or 
BCRP  indicated  no  or  low  affinity  for  efflux  transporters.  Contrary  to  in  vitro  data,  in  vivo  data  obtained  in 
Mdr1a/1b/Bcrp KO mice demonstrated an impact of efflux transporters on the overall absorption of ABT-267 in 
mice,  which  might  indicate  a  possible  species  difference  and/or  an  in  vitro/in  vivo  difference  in  transporter 
activity. Oral absorption of ABT-267 in rat was low with only 9% of the dose indicated to be absorbed in bile duct 
cannulated rats. 
Plasma clearance values were low in rat (0.46 L/hr•kg) and monkey (0.38 L/hr•kg), and even lower in dog (0.18 
L/hr•kg)  and  mouse  (0.11  L/hr•kg).    The  compound  was  characterized  by  moderate  to  high  volumes  of 
distribution (Vss) in all species, with values approximately 1.5 to 1.8 L/kg for mouse, dog and monkey and 4.8 
L/kg in rat.  The apparent elimination half-life ranged from 4.4 hr in monkey to approximately 11 hr in mouse 
and rat.  Oral bioavailability from a PEG solution formulation ranged from 25% in rat to 57% in dog.  ABT-267 
plasma concentrations following oral co-dosing with ritonavir in rat, dog and monkey were comparable to those 
obtained from an equivalent dose of ABT-267 administered alone in each species. 
The most favourable lipid/surfactant solution formulations provided AUCs in mice which were 5-10 fold higher 
than those in rat, leading to the selection of mouse as the preferred rodent species for multiple dose toxicity 
studies. The PEG-400: Tween 20: Poloxamer 124: Vitamin E TPGS (50:20:10:20, by weight) formulation was 
selected for repeat dose studies in mouse, rat and rabbit.  An alternate formulation (Phosal 53 MCT: PEG-400: 
Poloxamer  124:  Cremophor  RH40;  40:20:20:20,  by  weight),  which  removed  the  Vitamin  E  TPGS  while 
maintaining ABT-267 exposures, was selected for repeat dosing in the teratology and carcinogenicity studies. 
Plasma protein binding and blood-plasma ratios 
Plasma protein binding of ABT-450 was high at relevant plasma concentrations (0.1-10 µM; compared to the 
reported Cmax of ~2 µM) with no large species differences seen between mouse, rat, monkey and human (fu 
~0.5-1.5  %)  and  a  higher  protein  binding  in  dog  plasma  (fu  <0.2  %).  No  partitioning  into  the  cellular 
compartment was seen and blood-to-plasma concentration ratios averaged 0.58, 0.68, 0.85 and 1.0 in dog, 
human, monkey and rat, respectively at 1 µM (0.77 µg/mL). 
ABT-267 was highly protein bound, with fraction unbound (fu) values in plasma <0.1 % in all species tested and 
independent of the 0.1-10 µM concentrations tested (Cmax ~130 ng/mL; ~0.15 µM). No partitioning into the 
cellular compartment was seen, and blood-to-plasma concentration ratios were between 0.44-0.79 in rat, dog, 
monkey and human, independent of the 8-400 ng/mL concentrations used. 
For both major metabolites of ABT-267, protein binding was independent of concentration in mouse plasma (0.1 
to 10 µM), with fu values ranging from 0.7-1 % and 2-3 % for M29 and M36, respectively.  In human plasma 
data indicate a concentration dependent increase in protein binding at concentrations below 1 µM for both M29 
and  M36,  with  fu  values  ranging  from  0.2-1.5  and  0.4-2 %  for  M29  and  M36,  respectively  (with  no  further 
increase in fraction unbound in the concentrations ranging from 1-10 µM). 
Tissue distribution 
ABT-450: After a 30 mg [14C]ABT-450/kg and 15 mg ritonavir/kg oral dose (in oleic acid:PEG-400:Cremophor 
EL (80:10:10, w:w:w)) a limited distribution of radioactivity to tissues was seen in pigmented male Long-Evans 
Assessment report

rats analysed by Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography (QWBA).  The liver contained the highest amount of 
radioactivity between 0.5 to 48 hr post-dose relative to other tissues.  Cmax occurred at 4 hr post-dose in most 
tissues; tissue concentrations declined below quantifiable limits by 24 hr post-dose in all but urine and four 
tissues (cecum, liver, small intestine and urinary bladder). No preferential binding of radioactivity to eye(s) or 
non-pigmented  skin  was  seen  and  only  low  amounts  were  detected  in  pigmented  skin  and  only  at  4  hr 
post-dose. No distribution to brain tissues was seen. 
Small  amounts  of  radioactivity  were  detected  in  foetal  liver  at  8  and  12  hr  post-dose  (600-900  ng-eq/g  as 
compared to 156000 ng-eq/g in maternal liver at 8h and a Cmax in maternal whole blood of 10200 ng-eq/g at 
2 hours). 
14C-ABT-450-derived radioactivity was excreted in milk obtained from lactating rats for at least 24 hours post 
dose.  Mean  milk:plasma  concentration  ratios  were  less  than  one  through  12  hours  post  dose,  but  steadily 
increased from 0.173 at 0.5 hours post dose to 0.788 at 12 hours post dose reaching ratios greater than one at 
24 hours post dose (mean value of 1.86). 
ABT-267:  After  a  5  mg/kg  single  oral  dose  of  [14C]ABT-267  (in  Phosal  53  MCT:PEG  400:Poloxamer 
124:Cremophor RH40 (40:20:20:20 w:w:w:w)), drug derived radioactivity was slowly absorbed and distributed 
into tissues, with peak concentrations occurring 4-8 hours after dosing.  Highest concentrations of radioactivity 
were  found  in  adrenal  gland,  liver,  pancreas,  kidney  cortex  and  stomach  mucosa.    Concentrations  of 
radioactivity in tissues declined below the limits of quantitation by 168 hr post-dose. [14C]ABT-267-derived 
radioactivity did not preferentially bind to the melanin-containing tissues and did not distribute into the lens of 
the eye or CNS tissues. Only low amounts were detected in eye(s) (8 hr post-dose) and no differences between 
pigmented and non-pigmented skin was seen. 
Minimal amounts of radioactivity were detected in the foetal liver tissues at 8 and 12 hrs. post-dose.  All other 
foetal tissues, including foetal blood, and amniotic fluid were devoid of radioactivity throughout the course of 
this study. 
Radioactivity was measurable in milk from lactating rats for at least 24 hours after a single oral gavage dose of 
14C-ABT-267. Mean milk:plasma concentration ratios were less than one only at 1 hour post dose and were 
greater than one at all other collection times, with mean values ranging between 1.62 and 5.17 from 1 through 
24 hours post dose. 
Metabolism 
Metabolic  profiles  have  been  investigated  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  in  rat  and  dog  (ABT-450,  ABT-267  and 
Ritonavir), mouse (ABT-450, ABT-267) and rabbit (ABT-267). 
ABT-450: Microsomal intrinsic clearance of ABT-450 was relatively high in monkey (94 µL/min/mg) and human 
(88 µL/min/mg), followed by rat (50 µL/min/mg) and dog (31 µL/min/mg).  Similar rank ordering was observed 
in hepatocytes, with intrinsic clearances of 22.1, 19.3, 8.2 and 3.2 µL/min/L x 106 cells in monkey, human, rat 
and dog, respectively. CYP3A4/5 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of ABT-450. 
Metabolite identification showed that CYP-mediated oxidation of ABT-450 occurred on the phenanthridine group, 
the methylpyrazinyl group, the olefinic linker or combinations thereof. Unchanged parent drug was the major 
component  in  human  plasma  (90.1%  of  plasma  radioactivity).    Five  minor  metabolites  were  identified 
(metabolite  M2,  M3,  M6,  M13  and  M29)  and  none  of  the  metabolites  were  greater  than  10%  of  the  total 
radioactivity after administration of ABT-450 and ritonavir.  M2 was the major circulating metabolite in human 
plasma  (~23%  of  total  drug)  following  900  mg  single  oral  dose  of  ABT-450,  but  the  level  was  significantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 23/150 
  
  
reduced  (to  ~2.4%  of  total  drug)  when  ABT-450  was  co-dosed  with  ritonavir  (ABT-450/r  300/100  mg). 
Unchanged parent accounted for the remaining drug-related material in plasma (97.6% of the total). 
ABT-267 showed limited hepatic metabolism across species.  Microsomal intrinsic clearance values were 1.9, 
3.0, 18.4 and 3.4 µL/min/mg in rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively.  Similar observations were found in 
hepatocytes, with intrinsic clearances of 0.11, 0.83, 1.16, and 0.47 µL/min/million cells in rat, dog, monkey and 
human, respectively. ABT-267 was metabolized to a low extent and at a slow rate by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8. In 
vivo  metabolite  identification  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human  showed  that  ABT  267  is  primarily 
metabolized  through  enzymatic  amide  hydrolysis  at  the  aniline  amide  linker  to  generate  metabolite  M6 
(monoaniline), M7 (A-1241411; pyrrolidine acid) and M23 (A 1242846; dianiline). 
In  humans,  ABT-267,  M23,  M29,  M36  and  M37  are  the  main  components  in  plasma  after  a  single  dose  of 
ABT-267 alone, representing about 93% of total plasma radioactivity, with at least nine additional metabolites 
observed at either minor or trace levels. M23 is present in preclinical species at higher levels than in humans, 
providing safety coverage in all toxicology species. M29, M36 and M37 are downstream metabolites of M23, 
through t-butyl hydroxylation and demethylation, but they have not been observed in studies using animal and 
human-derived hepatic in vitro systems or in plasma or excreta of in vivo preclinical animals used in ADME or 
toxicology studies. M29 and M36 were defined as major disproportionate metabolites (i.e. greater than 10% of 
drug  related  AUC  at  steady  state)  and  specific  toxicological  studies  have  been  performed  with  these  two 
metabolites. Metabolite M37 is reported to be present in human plasma at a level just below 10% (9.3%) and 
the possibility that this metabolite might be a major metabolite in some individuals has not been addressed by 
the applicant. However, based on the absence of pharmacological activity and the results from the toxicological 
studies with M29 and M36 together with the low levels found in plasma of humans (Cmax 9, 31, 23 and 16 
ng/mL and AUC (ng•hr/mL) 194, 669, 442 and 312, for M23, M29, M36 and M37, respectively) and the similarity 
in structures, especially between M36 and M37 (a desmethyl keto-hydroxy dianiline as compared to a desmethyl 
di-hydroxy dianiline) any specific safety concerns due to the metabolite M37 as compared to the other major 
metabolites is considered to be unlikely. 
Excretion 
Excretion  following  oral  administration  of  ABT-450/r,  ritonavir  or  ABT-267  has  been  studied  in  rat,  dog 
(ABT-450, Ritonavir and ABT-267) and mouse (ABT-267). 
Following  oral  administration  of  ABT-450/r,  ritonavir  or  ABT-267  to  nonclinical  species  and  humans,  all 
compounds and their respective metabolites were mainly cleared via biliary excretion and fecal elimination, with 
minimal renal clearance. Bile duct cannulated rats treated intravenously with ABT-267 showed a mean recovery 
of 10.3% of the dose in faeces after 72 hours, indicating that a portion of the dose was secreted into the gut via 
a non-biliary route. No gender differences were seen in rats. 
Following  oral  administration  of  [14C]ABT-450/r  or  [14C]ABT-267  to  lactating  Sprague  Dawley  rats, 
[14C]ABT-450-  and  [14C]ABT-267-derived  radioactivity  was  excreted  in  milk.  A  majority  of  radioactivity 
excreted in milk was the ABT-450 hydrolysis product M13 (84.1% of milk radioactivity), followed by unchanged 
parent drug (15.9%) and the ABT-267-metabolite M19 (5.5%) together with one unidentified component (3.2% 
of milk radioactivity) and unchanged parent drug (91.2%), respectively. 
Relevance of species used in toxicological studies 
The choice of nonclinical species is considered acceptable. M29 and M36 were defined as major metabolites and 
have not been observed in studies using animal and human-derived hepatic in vitro systems or in plasma or 
excreta of in vivo preclinical animals used in ADME or toxicology studies. Separate toxicological studies have 
been performed with these two metabolites. Metabolite M37 is reported to be present in human plasma at a level 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 24/150 
  
  
just below 10% (9.3% in pooled plasma) and may also be considered to be a major disproportionate metabolite. 
However, as discussed above no safety concerns due to the metabolite M37 is expected and the lack of specific 
toxicological studies with this metabolite is considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profiles of ABT-267 and ABT-450/r have been evaluated in a comprehensive set of non-clinical 
studies. Studies on ABT-267 comprise repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs up to 3 months (rat) 
and 6 months (mouse, dog). Studies on ABT-450/r comprise repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs 
up  to  3  months  (rat),  6  months  (mouse)  and  9  months  (dog).  Both  compounds  have  been  evaluated  in 
genotoxicity,  reproductive  toxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  (Tg-rasH2  mice,  Sprague-Dawley  rats).  The 
ABT-267 rat carcinogenicity study is still on-going. No combination genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive 
toxicity studies have been conducted. This is in agreement with ICH M3(R2), where it is stated that no such 
studies generally are recommended if the individual agents have been studied to current standards.  
The choice of non-clinical species has been adequately justified. The non-clinical toxicology program has been 
performed according to relevant guidelines. All pivotal toxicology studies were performed in accordance with 
GLP. 
Single dose toxicity 
ABT-267 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  ABT-267.  In  accordance  with  ICH  M3  (R2)  and 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010, information on acute toxicity can be obtained from other types of studies (e.g. 
short duration dose ranging studies). A 5-day oral study in Tg-rasH2 non-transgenic mice with doses up to 300 
mg/kg has been performed, which is considered sufficient to justify the lack of dedicated single dose studies with 
this compound. No toxicity was observed; however, the exposure was limited by the poor solubility of ABT-267 
(AUC0-24 at 300 mg/kg was 43.5 µg·h/mL, corresponding to a 30x margin to human therapeutic exposure).  
ABT-450 
The acute toxicity of ABT-450 is considered to be low. Single oral doses of ≤600 mg/kg in rats and ≤100 mg/kg 
in  dogs  produced  no  mortality  and  were  well  tolerated.  However,  since  ABT-450  was  administered  without 
ritonavir as a PK enhancer, the exposures were low, especially in male rats (rat 600 mg/kg, males: Cmax 1.82 
µg/mL, AUC0-24 8.89 µg·h/mL; dog 100 mg/kg, mean: Cmax 61.3 µg/mL, AUC0-24 285 µg·h/mL). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
ABT-267 
Maximum exposures in the repeat-dose toxicity studies with ABT-267 were limited by the low solubility of the 
compound in all species tested. This was particularly obvious in the rat, where AUCs at the end of the 3-month 
study were in the range of 20-35 µg·h/mL, with no differences between the 30 and 300 mg/kg/day treatment 
groups. In mice, maximum exposures were obtained at approximately 100 mg/kg, with comparable exposures 
at doses up to the limits of solubility (500 mg/kg). Highest exposure was achieved in Beagle dogs (mean AUC at 
the end of the 3- and 6-months studies: 83 µg·h/mL (margin to exposure at RHD: 58x).  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 25/150 
  
  
With the exception of adverse liver findings in a non-GLP 14-day mouse study, no dose-limiting toxicity was 
identified in the ABT-267 repeat-dose toxicity studies. A number of non-adverse findings were observed, as 
described below. No evaluation of recovery was performed in the 3- and 6-month dog studies. In view of the 
non-adverse nature of the findings this is considered acceptable.    
Liver 
Single cell hepatocellular necrosis and increased ALT, AST and GLDH were observed in a 14-day non-GLP study 
in  mice.  These  effects  on  the  liver  were  not  observed  in  pivotal  studies  up  to  6  months  with  higher  doses; 
however, the exposure was not as high in the long-term studies. AUC0-24 on Day 1 in high-dose males in the 
14-day study was 127.3 µg·h/mL, to be compared with the AUCs obtained at the high dose level in the 3- and 
6-month studies (Day 1 values in males ranging from 28.4 to 69.7 µg·h/mL). The margin between predicted 
human exposure and the estimated exposure at NOAEL (3.8 µg·h/mL) in the 14-day study is 2.7x.  
A few non-adverse liver findings related to treatment with ABT-267 were present in the dog studies. Increased 
liver weights were observed in females at 100 mg/kg (6-month study), and in one female in the 3-month study. 
In this dog, but not in the others, the liver weight change was associated with mild hepatocellular vacuolation. 
The margin to this latter finding, based on predicted human exposure (AUC) is at least 58x. 
Increased  ALT  (1.3-4x)  was  observed  in  individual  animals  at  60  mg/kg  (14-day  non-GLP  study),  2  mg/kg 
(3-month study) and 4 mg/kg (6 month study). Since there was no dose response correlation in the longer term 
studies, the relationship to treatment with ABT-267 is considered equivocal. 
Intestine 
Dogs  administered  100  mg/kg  showed  dilatation  of  lymphoid  vessels  in  the  jejunum  (3-month  study)  and 
vacuolation in the duodenum and jejunum (6-month study). Both changes were minimal to mild, and since there 
was no obvious effect on function they are not considered to be adverse.  
Haematology and coagulation 
Alterations of red blood cell parameters (decreased RBC, haemoglobin and haematocrit) were present in one 
female  high  dose  dog  (3-month  study)  and  in  females  at  >  20  mg/kg  in  the  6-month  study.  Decreased 
haemoglobin was also present in males at 100 mg/kg in the 6-month study. In addition, males at > 20 mg/kg 
showed increased platelets and at 100 mg/kg there was a decrease in APTT in males in the 6-month study. In 
the absence of other findings, none of the haematological changes are considered to be adverse. 
Female reproductive system 
Non-adverse  effects  on  female  reproductive  organs  (vaginal  mucification,  increased  incidence  of  ovarian 
follicular cysts) were observed at the high dose level in the 3-month mouse study. The margin to predicted 
human exposure (AUC) is x26 (females). This effect was not reproducible in the 6-month study, despite similar 
exposure.  
Body weight 
Conflicting  effects  on  body  weight  were  noted  in  mice.  While  statistically  significant  body  weight  increase, 
associated with increased food consumption, was present in females at > 40 mg/kg (3-month study), slightly 
lower body weight in females occurred at all dose levels in the 6 month study. None of the observed body weight 
changes are considered to be adverse. 
In  conclusion,  oral  administration  of  ABT-267  for  up  to  3  months  in  rats,  and  6  months  in  mice  and  dogs, 
resulted in no dose-limiting effects, at saturating systemic exposures. The only toxicity observed was single cell 
hepatocellular necrosis and increased liver enzymes in a non-GLP 14-day mouse study (estimated margin to 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 26/150 
 
  
  
NOAEL: 2.7x). Non-adverse effects in the repeat dose toxicity studies comprised lymph vessel dilatation and 
vacuolation in the small intestine (dog), vaginal mucification and increased ovarian follicular cysts (mouse), 
increased liver weights with or without correlation to hepatocellular vacuolation (dog), changes in body weight 
(mouse) and alterations in red blood cell and coagulation parameters (dog). Overall, the margin to predicted 
human exposure associated with a 25 mg daily dose (1.42 µg·h/mL) and NOAELs in the ABT-267 repeat-dose 
toxicity studies are in the range of 20-50x. 
ABT-450 
All repeat dose toxicity studies with ABT-450 were conducted utilizing ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. 
Different dosages of ritonavir were used for the various species, in order to achieve maximal feasible exposure 
of ABT-450. Effects attributable to ritonavir are described separately.  
Gallbladder 
Minimal to moderate focal erosion/ulceration, chronic active inflammation, epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia 
and diffuse acute inflammation were observed at > 100/30 mg/kg in the 6-month mouse study. The gallbladder 
changes are considered to be the result of ABT-450 administration, as they have not been identified in previous 
studies with ritonavir and were not present at the low dose of 30/30 mg/kg, which had the highest ritonavir 
exposure. The finding of increased neutrophils in females at 300/30 mg/kg is probably linked to the gallbladder 
inflammation. The margin to predicted human exposure associated with a 150 mg daily dose (7 µg·h/mL) and 
the  NOAEL  is  3.7-5.8x  (mean  4.8x).  The  gallbladder  changes  were  partially  resolved  in  mice  after  1  month 
recovery.  
In dogs, minimal to mild oedema, mononuclear/mixed cell infiltration, degeneration, necrosis and increased 
mitoses were observed to varying extent in the gallbladder in all repeat-dose toxicity studies > 1 month duration. 
Since degeneration and necrosis are considered to be adverse effects, even when present to minimal degree, 
the Applicant’s proposed NOAELs for these findings are not agreed with. At a more appropriate lower NOAEL for 
these findings (10/5 mg/kg), the corresponding mean AUCs are in the range of 206-615 µg·h/mL (margin to 
RHD:  29-87x).  The  findings  were  fully  reversible  after  1  month  recovery.  Increased  ALP  in  the  1-,  3-  and 
9-months  studies  is  probably  related  to  the  gallbladder  effects,  since  there  was  no  increase  in  other  liver 
enzymes and (apart from mild non-adverse findings in the 9-month study) no effects on liver morphology.  
The mechanism behind the observed gallbladder findings is not known, but may conceivably be related to the 
high biliary excretion of ABT-450 with associated high local concentrations in the gallbladder. Review of the 
3DAA Phase 2/3 data set revealed no evidence of treatment-related gallbladder disorders in humans. Thus, the 
non-clinical gallbladder findings appear not to be readily translatable to the clinical situation. 
Intestine 
Minimal to moderate vacuolation was observed in the lamina propria of the duodenum and jejunum of dogs 
treated  at  20/10  or  80/20  mg/kg  ABT-450/r  for  9  months.  The  vacuoles  were  shown  to  contain  fat,  as 
demonstrated by positive Oil Red staining. There was no reversibility of this finding after 1 month recovery.  
Liver and kidney 
Mild diffuse intrasinusoidal vacuolation was observed in the liver in dogs at 80/20 mg/kg in the 9-month study. 
It is not clear which cell type was affected, and there was no attempt to determine the nature of the vacuoles. 
In  the  kidney,  minimal  to  mild  vacuolation  of  the  tubular  epithelium  was  observed  at  80/20  mg/kg  in  the 
9-month dog study. No special staining was performed to further characterize the vacuoles. Neither the liver nor 
kidney findings were reversible after 1 month recovery.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 27/150 
 
  
  
Since the clinical exposure margins to the findings in the intestine, liver and kidney in the dog 9-month study are 
high (88-212x based on AUC), they are not considered to be of relevance in the clinical situation.  
Food consumption 
Increased food consumption, sometimes correlated with increased body weight, was observed in the 3- and 
6-months mouse studies, as well as in the 1-month non-transgenic Tg-rasH2 study. The LOEL was 30/30 mg/kg, 
corresponding to an AUC (females) of 38.8 (5.5x margin to RHD). These effects are not considered adverse.  
Findings of equivocal relationship to ABT-450 
Changes in coagulation parameters were observed in dogs (decreased APTT in the 1-, 3- and 9-month studies, 
increased platelets and decreased mean platelet volume in the 9-month study). Although decreased APTT was 
observed in the original ritonavir 6-month dog study, this effect was not seen consistently in the ritonavir dog 
studies. Since decreased APTT showed a tendency toward dose response in the ABT-450/r dog studies, a 
relationship to treatment cannot be excluded. The margin at RHD to LOEL in the 3-month dog study is in the 
range of 6x. In the absence of other findings, these effects on coagulation parameters are considered 
non-adverse. 
Increased bilirubin was observed in females at > 30/30 mg/kg in the 3-month mouse study, and in females at 
300/30 mg/kg in the 6-month mouse study. It is possible that this finding could be related to ritonavir; however, 
increases in bilirubin in the original 3-month ritonavir mouse study occurred at considerably higher exposure 
levels (16x based on AUC) as compared with the exposures in the ABT-450/r mouse studies. Since ABT-450 is 
a known inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters, it cannot be excluded that the increased bilirubin in 
the ABT-450/r mouse studies is related to this mechanism. This effect is not considered adverse.  
Alterations in serum chemistry parameters in CD-1mice (decreased total protein, albumin and globulin in 
females at 300/100 mg/kg and decreased globulin in males at 100/100 mg/kg) were observed in the 1-month 
study. Minimally decreased albumin and protein in males were observed in the 6-month mouse study, at > 
30/30 mg/kg and 300/30 mg/kg, respectively. There was also a slight increase in chloride in males at all dose 
levels in this study. Similar findings have not been reported for ritonavir in mice. However, since there was no 
clear dose response relationship, the relationship to treatment with ABT-450 is considered questionable. None 
of the observed serum chemistry changes is considered adverse. 
Other findings 
High pre-terminal mortality was noted in the ABT-450/r mouse studies. In general, this was associated with 
gavage error/aspiration. Although it was not possible to determine the cause of death in some cases, it is well 
known that mice are more sensitive than rats to handling, and there is usually higher mortality in mouse studies 
as compared with rat studies. There are no indications that the observed mortality was related to ABT-450/r 
treatment. 
Decreased thymus and pituitary gland weights were observed in dogs in one of the 1-month studies. Since there 
was  no  correlation  with  microscopic  findings  and  the  organ  weight  changes  were  not  present  in  the  other 
1-month study at comparable exposure levels, or in the 3- and 9-months studies, they are considered of no 
toxicological relevance.  
Changes in serum phosphorus (increase or decrease) were seen in the 5-day and 9-month dog studies. Since 
these  changes  in  general  were  of  small  magnitude  and  not  correlated  with  any  other  findings,  they  are 
considered of no toxicological relevance. 
In conclusion, oral administration of ABT-450 for up to 3 months in rats, 6 months in mice and 9 months in dogs, 
resulted in adverse effects on the gallbladder in mice and dogs. The clinical exposure margin to NOAEL for these

effects  is  4.8x  in  the  mouse  and  29.4x  in  the  dog.  Non-adverse  effects  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies 
comprised  diffuse  intrasinusoidal  vacuolation  in  the  liver  (dog),  vacuolation  in  the  small  intestine  and  renal 
tubular epithelium (dog) and increased food consumption (mice). Non-adverse findings of equivocal relationship 
to treatment with ABT-450 included alterations in coagulation parameters (dog) and increased serum bilirubin 
(mice). Overall, the margins to predicted human exposure associated with a 150 mg daily dose (7.0 µg·h/mL) 
and NOAELs in the ABT-450 repeat-dose toxicity studies are in the range of 4.8-87.8x. 
Ritonavir 
Liver 
Effects on the liver occurred in the majority of repeat-dose toxicity studies where ritonavir was dosed in 
combination with ABT-450. These liver effects are considered to be related to ritonavir and not to ABT-450 based 
on the known toxicological profile of ritonavir, the presence of similar incidence rates across dose groups, and a 
lack of increased incidence and/or severity with increased dose/exposure of ABT-450.  
Increased liver weights were observed in repeat dose mouse studies from 7 days up to 6 months duration, with 
or without corresponding microscopic changes (hepatocellular hypertrophy, necrosis/inflammation), at > 30 
mg/kg. In rats, increased liver weights associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes 
and periportal/periductular mononuclear cell infiltration, occurred in one 1-month study and the 3-month study, 
at > 15 mg/kg.  Other liver effects related to ritonavir in rodent repeat dose toxicity studies comprised increases 
in ALT, AST, total protein, cholesterol and triglycerides. Most of the findings, including microscopic liver changes, 
were at least partially resolved after a 1 month recovery period. Exposure levels for liver effects in rodents in the 
original ritonavir repeat-dose toxicity studies are within the same range as those observed in the present 
application when ritonavir was administered in combination with ABT-450. 
In dogs, ritonavir-related effects on the liver were less conspicuous than in rodents. Increased liver weight 
without any correlating microscopic findings was observed in one of the 1-month studies, and in the 9-month 
study. These liver weight changes were observed at exposures within the same range or higher as the original 
ritonavir dog studies. 
The mean exposure (AUC0-24) at the LOEL for liver weight changes in the long-term mouse and rat studies 
ranged from 15 µg·h/mL (rat 3-month study) to 24.4 µg·h/mL (mouse 3-month study). The margin to clinical 
exposure at RHD is < 2x for the effects in rats.  
Thyroid gland  
Minimal to mild follicular cell hypertrophy was observed in two rat studies (one of the 1-month studies, and the 
3-month study). This effect was clearly related to ritonavir, since it occurred with highest severity in the 0/45 
mg/kg dose group. In the 3-month study, the microscopic changes in the thyroid gland correlated with increased 
thyroid weight. There was a tendency towards decreased effects on the thyroid gland in females administered 
450/45 mg/kg, associated with decreased ritonavir exposure when ABT-450 was coadministered at this dose 
level. The mechanism behind the thyroid findings is proposed to be an increased hepatic microsomal enzyme 
metabolism of thyroid hormone, leading to increased release of TSH and as a consequence of this thyroid gland 
hypertrophy. Rats are known to be much more sensitive to these effects compared with other species, including 
humans. Thus, the observed thyroid effects related to ritonavir administration are not considered adverse.  
Erythroid parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 29/150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Effects on erythroid parameters (decreased RBC, haemoglobin and haematocrit; increased reticulocytes) were 
observed in several ABT-450/r repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs. These shifts reflect a loss of 
red blood cell mass, with a compensatory regenerative response. Similar findings were seen in the original 
ritonavir toxicity studies.  
Gastrointestinal effects in dogs 
Vomiting/emesis and diarrhoea were observed in all ABT-450/r repeat-dose toxicity studies > 1 month duration 
in dogs. Decreased body weight (3- and 9 months studies) and decreased serum protein (9-month study) are 
considered to be consequences of these effects. Similar findings have been observed in the original ritonavir dog 
toxicity studies, at slightly (1.5-3.5x) higher exposure.  
In conclusion, ritonavir added to ABT-450 as a pharmacokinetic enhancer caused a number of effects on the 
liver, thyroid gland, erythroid parameters, and (in dogs) gastrointestinal system. All of these effects have been 
observed in previous nonclinical toxicity studies with ritonavir and are mostly non-adverse. Considering that the 
majority of ritonavir-related findings in the ABT-450/r studies is of adaptive character and can be regarded as 
non-adverse, and that there is long clinical experience with ritonavir, the small exposure margin to RHD is 
considered acceptable.  
Combination repeat-dose toxicity 
In line with CHMP recommendations (EMEA/H/SA/1588/1/2010/III), no combination toxicity studies with 
ABT-267 and ABT-450/r were conducted. The exposure levels relative to RHD achieved in the single agent, 
repeat-dose toxicity studies with ABT-267 (35x in mice, 20x in rats, 58x in dogs) and ABT-450/r (59x in mice, 
14x in rats, 212x in dogs) are considered sufficiently high to identify target organs of toxicity. The only potential 
overlapping toxicity concerns the ritonavir-related liver effects and the liver effects of ABT-267. Since the 
majority of ritonavir-related effects are considered non-adverse, and there is considerable clinical experience 
with this compound, a combination toxicity study is not considered to add any significant value to the safety 
evaluation of ABT-267 and ABT-450/r. Thus, it is agreed that no combination toxicity studies with these 
compounds are necessary.  
The Applicant performed a 1-month safety tolerability study in mice, using a fixed dose combination of 
ABT/ritonavir/ABT-267 at 30/20/2 mg/kg/day, respectively. No adverse effects were observed. The margins to 
RHD, based on AUC, were for ABT-450 2.7x and for ABT-267 3.4x.  
ABT-450/r in combination with ribavirin 
In two rat studies (1- and 3-month duration) using ABT-450/r in combination with ribavirin several expected 
toxicological effects of ritonavir (increased liver and thyroid gland weights associated with hepatocellular 
hypertrophy and thyroid follicular hypertrophy) and ribavirin (decreased body weight and food consumption, 
alterations in erythroid parameters, decreased thymus weight correlated with decreased number of thymic 
lymphocytes) were observed. There were no findings directly related to ABT-450, and ABT-450 coadministration 
did not exacerbate the ritonavir- or ribavirin-related effects. Coadministration of ribavirin with ABT-450 and/or 
ritonavir did not significantly affect the compound-specific plasma exposures in the 1-month study. In the 
3-month study, coadministration with ribavirin caused a slight decrease in exposure of ABT-450.

Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
ABT-267 
ABT-267 tested negative in a complete package of genotoxicity studies, including tests for gene mutations and 
chromosomal aberrations in vitro and chromosomal aberrations in vivo. The carcinogenic potential of ABT-267 
was evaluated in a 26-week study in Tg-rasH2 transgenic mice and a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague 
Dawley  rats.  There  were  no  significant  increases  in  neoplastic  changes  due  to  ABT-267  treatment  in  the 
Tg-rasH2  mouse  study  at  doses  <150  mg/kg/day  (26x  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC).  Since  the  rat 
carcinogenicity study is still on-going it is not possible to conclude on the carcinogenic potential of ABT-267.  
ABT-450 
In the in vitro genotoxicity assays, ABT-450 tested negative for gene mutations but positive for chromosomal 
aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The Applicant performed two in vivo genotoxicity studies 
(rat  bone  marrow  micronucleus,  Comet  assay  on  rat  liver).  The  results  of  both  were  negative  up  to  2000 
mg/kg/day. Exposure (AUC) in the rat micronucleus study was 83.3 µg·h/mL at 2000 mg/kg, corresponding to 
a 12x margin to exposure at RHD. In the Comet assay, mean liver concentration at the high dose was 172 µg/g. 
The exposure in terms of microgram quantities in the liver was in the same range as the concentrations that 
produced positive chromosome aberration results in vitro. In conclusion, the weight of evidence indicates that 
ABT-450 does not carry a significant genotoxic risk.  
The carcinogenic potential of ABT-450 was evaluated in a 26-week study in Tg-rasH2 transgenic mice and a 
2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats. There were no significant increases in neoplastic changes 
due to ABT-450 treatment in the Tg-rasH2 mouse study at doses < 300 mg/kg/day (38x clinical exposure based 
on AUC). Non-neoplastic gallbladder effects similar to those in the 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study in CD-1 
mice were observed at > 60/30 mg/kg/day, without any signs of progression to neoplasia. In the 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study, there were no statistically significant increases in neoplastic changes at doses < 300 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to 8.5-11.5x the exposure at RHD. However, there was an apparently increased 
incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in males at the mid and high dose (1/160, 1/80, 6/160 in combined 
vehicle controls, low dose and similarly exposed combined mid/high dose groups, respectively). The mean 
historical control incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma at the test laboratory during the period 2009-2014 was 
1.4-4.6%. In total, 26 control groups from 20 study occasions are included in the historical control data set. Of 
these, four groups had an incidence higher than (4.6%; two groups from the same occasion) or in the same 
range (2.9% and 3.3%) as the incidence in the mid/high dose males (3.7%), while most groups (22) had an 
incidence below or equal to 1.7%. The incidence of the combined mid and high dose group might thus be 
considered to be within or at least close to the historical control range. Based on these data, and the absence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma in female rats and TgHras mice and also considering the present indication and short 
duration of treatment, the apparently increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in males is concluded to 
be without clinical relevance.      
Ritonavir 
Ritonavir was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays, including the Ames reverse 
mutation assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test, and chromosomal aberration assays 
in human lymphocytes. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, ritonavir at doses of 7, 15 
and 30 mg/kg/day (mean combined-sex AUC at high dose: 6.39 µg·h/mL) did not cause any significant increase 
in neoplastic changes. However, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, ritonavir at doses of 50, 100 and 
200  mg/kg/day  (mean  AUC  in  males  at  high  dose:  39.9  µg·h/mL)  produced  a  significant  increase  in  the 
incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas 
at the high dose level in males. It is noted that liver tumours in CD-1 mice occurred at similar ritonavir exposure 
Assessment report

levels as were achieved in the ABT-450/r Tg-rasH2 mouse study, where no neoplastic changes in the liver were 
observed. This might indicate that the Tg-rasH2 model is less sensitive than the conventional 2-year mouse 
study for the detection of ritonavir-induced liver tumours. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
ABT-267 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
The effects of ABT-267 on fertility and early embryonic development were evaluated in mice. There were no 
effects on male fertility and female reproductive parameters up to the highest dose tested (200 mg/kg/day). 
Toxicokinetics were not conducted in this study; however, it can be assumed that exposure was approximately 
within the same range as in the 6-months repeat-dose toxicity study, where the combined-sex exposure (AUC) 
at  200  mg/kg/day  was  36.45  µg·h/mL  (25.7x  clinical  exposure  at  RHD).  In  male  mice,  increased 
prostate/seminal vesicle weights and decreased testes weights were observed mainly at 200 mg/kg/day. In 
addition, one male at 5 mg/kg/day showed small testes and epididymides at necropsy. Since there were no 
similar  organ  weight  changes  and  no  microscopic  findings  in  male  reproductive  organs  in  the  repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in mice, and no effects were observed on mating performance, these observations in male mice 
are considered to be of equivocal relationship to ABT-267 and non-adverse. In conclusion, the NOAEL for both 
sexes in the ABT-267 fertility and early embryonic development study in mice was 200 mg/kg/day. 
Embryo-foetal development 
The effects of ABT-267 on embryo-foetal development were evaluated in mice and rabbits. In both species, the 
dose limit was determined by  saturation of systemic exposure.  In the mouse  study,  no maternal toxicity or 
embryotoxicity was observed. No statistically significant effects were observed on litter parameters. There was 
a slight non-significant increase in the incidence of foetuses with any alteration (malformation + variation) in the 
ABT-267-treated groups (22.6%, 24.8%, 26.1% and 27.3% in control, low, mid and high dose, respectively. 
Increased incidences as compared with the concurrent control group were noted for open eye lid and cleft palate 
in  all  ABT-267-treated  groups.  One  foetus  each  at  15  and  150  mg/kg/day,  respectively,  displayed  multiple 
craniofacial malformations. Furthermore, there was a foetus with craniofacial deformation in the dose range 
finding study.  
Historical control data provided by the Applicant showed that the incidences of cleft palate were within the 
historical control range at the test laboratory. However, the foetal incidence (1.5%), as well as litter incidence 
(20%), for open eye lid at the low dose level was above the historical control range both for DRF and pivotal 
studies. There was no clear dose response; however, the exposure curve was rather flat and no difference in 
maternal or fetal exposure was present between the mid and high dose levels. There was only a 3-fold higher 
maternal exposure at the high dose level (GD 15 AUC 38 μg·hr/mL) as compared with the low dose level (GD15 
AUC 13.6 μg·hr/mL). The highest AUC level was present at the mid dose (40.4 µg·h/mL, corresponding to 28.5x 
clinical exposure at RHD). 
In  the  absence  of  a  clear  dose  response  for  the  observed  malformations,  the  relationship  to  ABT-267 
administration  is  considered  uncertain.  However,  in  view  of  the  findings  in  the  rabbit  embryo-foetal 
development  study,  where  craniofacial  malformations  were  observed  at  the  high  dose  level,  it  cannot  be 
completely  excluded  that  the  increased  incidences  of  open  eye  lid  and  cleft  palate  in  the  ABT-267  mouse 
embryo-foetal development study were related to treatment with ABT-267. The maternal NOAEL in the mouse 
EFD study was 150 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. This corresponds to an AUC0-24 level of 38 µg·h/mL 
(26.8x clinical exposure at RHD). For the foetal findings, there was no NOAEL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 32/150 
 
  
  
In the ABT-267 rabbit embryo-foetal development studies, very low exposures were achieved (AUC0-24 at 60 
mg/kg/day in the pivotal study = 6.26 µg·h/mL, corresponding to 4.4x clinical exposure at RHD). Although a 
different vehicle was used in the pivotal study as compared with the dose range finding study, this did not result 
in any increased exposure. No maternal toxicity or embryotoxicity was observed in any of the studies. In the 
pivotal study, there was a non-significant increase in total external, visceral and skeletal malformations at 60 
mg/kg/day. None of the malformations at the high dose level were above the upper end of the historical control 
incidence range, except for microphthalmia and absent incisors.  
Microphthalmia was seen in 15% of the litters at 60 mg/kg/day versus 0% in the concurrent control group and 
9.1% (upper end of range) in historical controls. The foetal incidence at 60 mg/kg/day (1.7%) was above the 
concurrent control group (0%) but within the range of historical controls (2.3%). Microphthalmia was seen in 
the dose range finding study as well, in 2/49 (4%) foetuses at 60 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24:10 µg·h/mL on GD 19).  
Absent incisors was seen in 10% of the litters at 60 mg/kg/day versus 0% in the control group and 5.3% (upper 
end of range) in historical controls. The foetal incidence at 60 mg/kg/day (1.2%) was also above historical 
controls (0.6%).  
One foetus at 60 mg/kg was observed with microphthalmia, absent incisors, fused nares, and misshapen jaw. 
Another fetus at 60 mg/kg showed thoracogastroschisis, craniorachischisis, underdeveloped skin, ectrodactyly, 
abnormal flexure of the fore- and hind paw, microphthalmia, open eye, absent incisors, cleft palate, pinna 
smaller than normal, malrotated hind legs, and misshapen jaw. The third fetus at 60 mg/kg with microphthalmia 
showed a malpositioned kidney. In total across the two rabbit studies, 4/5 fetuses with microphthalmia showed 
additional malformations. Of special note is the fact that absent incisors and misshapen jaw occurred alongside 
microphthalmia in two fetuses from different litters, indicating a common pattern.  
Based on the presence of microphthalmia and absent incisors at a higher incidence (both litter and foetal) in the 
high dose group versus concurrent and historical controls, the foetal NOAEL is considered to be 10 mg/kg/day 
(AUC0-24  =  3.44  µg·h/mL,  corresponding  to  2.4x  clinical  exposure  at  RHD).  Based  on  the  available  data,  a 
teratogenic effect in rabbits cannot be excluded.  
The foetal effects in rabbits, which were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity at an exposure close to the 
intended therapeutic level, raise concern for use in pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential. This 
concern  is  strengthened  by  the  findings  of  increased  incidences  of  foetal  craniofacial  malformations  in  mice 
treated with ABT-267. Accordingly, the SmPC text under sections 4.6 and 5.3 has been revised to the effect that 
Viekirax  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  or  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective 
contraception. No additional risk minimization measures are considered necessary.  
Prenatal and postnatal development 
Effects of ABT-267 on prenatal and postnatal development were studied in mice. There were no adverse effects 
noted in the dams or in the F1 generation during the pre-and post-weaning periods, except for two mortalities 
at 200 mg/kg/day during the post-weaning period. Both of these animals had shown reduced body weights as 
compared with controls on the day after weaning. Since a relationship to treatment with ABT-267 cannot be 
excluded,  the  Applicant’s  proposed  NOAEL  for  the  F1  generation  (200  mg/kg/day)  is  not  agreed  with.  The 
maternal (F0) NOAEL is considered to be 200 mg/kg/day, and the F1 NOAEL  for viability and growth in the 
offspring 40 mg/kg/day. Although a toxicokinetic analysis was performed, it only comprised average dam and 
pup concentrations (µg/mL) and no AUC values were measured. Therefore it is not possible to calculate a margin

to human clinical exposure. As demonstrated by quantifiable levels of ABT-267 in pups at > 40 mg/kg/day, there 
was passage of ABT-267 across the placenta.  
ABT-450 
Fertility and early embryonic development  
The effects of ABT-450/r on fertility and early embryonic development were evaluated in rats. There were no 
effects on male fertility and female reproductive parameters up to the highest dose tested (300/30 mg/kg/day), 
corresponding to ABT-450 AUC levels of 11.5 µg·h/mL (males) and 35.6 µg·h/mL (females). The margin to 
clinical exposure at RHD is low (1.6-5x). Small testes and epididymides were observed in one high dose males 
at necropsy. Since there were no similar gross findings and no microscopic findings in male reproductive organs 
in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, and no effects were observed on mating performance, this 
observation is considered to be of equivocal relationship to ABT-450/r and non-adverse. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Due to vehicle-related maternal toxicity and the lack of appreciable exposures despite investigation of both oral 
and parenteral formulations, evaluation of embryo-foetal development effects in rabbits was not possible. Thus, 
the ABT-450/r embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in mice and rats. This is in line with CHMP 
scientific advice given to the Applicant, which recommended that various routes of administration as well as the 
feasibility of replacing the non-tolerated vehicle in rabbits should be explored. The choice of mice instead of 
rabbits is considered acceptable.  
In the pivotal mouse embryo-foetal development study, no maternal toxicity or embryotoxicity was seen. There 
were no treatment-related effects on uterine or litter parameters. The Applicant considered that all observed 
malformations were unrelated to ABT-450/r based on absence of dose response, findings limited to the control 
group  and/or  incidences  generally  within  historical  control  range  at  the  test  laboratory.  However,  increased 
incidences as compared with the concurrent control group were observed in ABT-450/r-treated groups for the 
craniofacial malformations exencephaly and open eye lids. The Applicant provided historical control data from 
the test laboratory, demonstrating that the incidences of exencephaly were within the historical control range. 
However, this was not the case for open eye lids, for which fetal and litter incidences at the low and mid dose 
levels were above the historical control range.  Although there was no clear dose response, a relationship to 
treatment with ABT-450/r cannot be excluded. It is possible that the lack of dose response may be related to 
interactions between ritonavir and ABT-450.   
In  conclusion,  the  maternal  NOAEL  in  the  ABT-450/r  mouse  embryo-foetal  development  study  was  300/30 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to an AUC0-24 of 686 µg·h/mL (98x margin to clinical exposure at RHD). There was no 
NOAEL for the foetal effects. Thus, there is a concern for the use of ABT-450 in pregnancy and in women of 
child-bearing potential. The SmPC text under sections 4.6 and 5.3 has been revised accordingly. No additional 
risk minimization measures are considered necessary.  
In  the  ABT-450/r  pivotal  rat  study,  no  maternal  toxicity  or  embryotoxicity  was  observed.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  in  number  of  litters  or  foetuses  with  malformations.  Slightly  increased,  statistically 
non-significant incidences of total visceral (>100/15 mg/kg/day) and skeletal variations (> 30/15 mg/kg/day) 
were observed. The increase in visceral variations was mainly due to higher incidence of dilated ureters and 
increased  renal  pelvic  cavitation,  within  or  slightly  above  the  historical  control  range.  Incidences  of  specific 
skeletal  variations  were  within  the  historical  control  range,  except  for  misaligned  sternebrae,  which  were 
marginally above the historical control range for litter incidence. Due to the small magnitude of these effects, 
they are not considered adverse. In conclusion, the maternal and foetal NOAEL was 450/45 mg/kg/day, the 
highest dose tested. At this dose level, AUC0-24 was 58.6 µg·h/mL (8.4x margin to clinical exposure at RHD). 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014

Prenatal and postnatal development  
The effects of ABT-450/r on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in rats. No adverse maternal F0 
effects were observed. There were no effects on survival, growth, sexual maturation, motor activity, learning 
and memory, mating and fertility, male reproductive organ weights or ovarian and uterine parameters in the F1 
generation rats. Accordingly, the maternal NOAEL as well as the F1 NOAEL for viability and growth in the 
offspring was 300/30 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. An unexpectedly high exposure for ABT-450 was 
achieved at this dose level: 116 µg·h/mL, corresponding to a 16.5x margin to clinical exposure at RHD. The 
presence of quantifiable concentrations of ABT-450 in pups at 300 mg/kg/day demonstrates passage of 
ABT-450 across the placenta. No quantifiable levels of ritonavir were present in the pups.  
Ritonavir 
No effects on male and female fertility, or embryonic development, were observed in rats at dosages up to 125 
mg/kg/day in males and 75 mg/kg/day in females, corresponding to mean AUC levels of 61.0 and 90.5 µg·h/mL, 
respectively. In rabbit and rat embryo-foetal development studies, embryotoxicity occurred with maternally 
toxic high dose (75 mg/kg/day in the rat, 110 mg/kg/day in the rabbit). In the rat, a slight increase in 
cryptorchidism was seen at 35 mg/kg/day (mean AUC0-24 value 34.3 µg·h/mL). This finding, which may be 
regarded as a developmental retardation, did not lead to a contraindication of ritonavir in pregnant women. The 
peri/post natal toxicity study revealed no treatment-related effects. 
Juvenile toxicity 
No juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted. Since this application only concerns an indication in adults, 
this is considered acceptable. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Immunotoxicity 
No dedicated immunotoxicology studies have been conducted with ABT-267 or ABT-450/r. Since the results of 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies do not indicate any significant effects on the immune system related to ABT-267 
or ABT-450/r, this is considered acceptable.  
Local Tolerance  
No separate local tolerance studies were conducted with ABT-267, ABT-450 or ABT-450/r. Since the intended 
therapeutic route is oral, local tolerance can be evaluated within the frame of general toxicity studies. 
Accordingly, no separate local tolerance studies are required. In repeat dose toxicity studies with ABT-450/r, 
erosions/ulcerations and inflammation in the gallbladder occurred in mice and dogs, most likely reflecting high 
local concentrations of the test compound in bile with associated local irritative effects. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
ABT-267 and ABT-450 absorb light between 290 and 700 nm and have maximal molar extinction coefficients

(MECs) that exceed the guideline threshold of 1000 mol-1 cm-1. ABT-267 distributed to the skin and, at low 
concentrations, to the eyes. ABT-450/r distributed at low concentrations to pigmented skin, but not to the eyes. 
ABT-267 was not phototoxic in a 3-day in vivo study in hairless mice at doses < 200 mg/kg/day (8x clinical 
exposure  based  on  AUC).  No  in  vitro  or  in  vivo  phototoxicity  studies  were  performed  with  ABT-450.  The 
Applicant refers to clinical data, demonstrating that there were no serious adverse events and no discontinuation 
of treatment due to a photosensitivity event. Based on this, the Applicant concludes that no risk minimization 
measures are warranted for the 3DAA or 2DAA combinations to prevent phototoxicity-related adverse events in 
humans.  
The performed Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials with the 3DAA regimen were primarily conducted over the period of 
November 2012 through November 2013, and included the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. In the 
clinical trials, there were no restrictions on sun exposure or requirements for sun protection or use of sunscreen 
and the percentage of subjects with rash-related treatment-emergent events following treatment with the 3DAA 
regimen (13.9%) was comparable to that observed for placebo subjects (15.7%), suggesting that the higher 
frequency  of  rash-related  events  in  the  3DAA  +  RBV  treatment  groups  (28.6%)  was  primarily  due  to  the 
presence of RBV. In addition, utilizing a company MedDRA query (CMQ) for photosensitivity reactions a search 
was performed which identified a low and comparable incidence of photosensitivity preferred terms (0.9% for 
the ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 + RBV group, 1.0% for ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 and 0.8% for 
the placebo group) for the 3DAA+RBV regimen and placebo. According to the Applicant, all events in the three 
groups were non-serious, mild in severity and did not lead to study drug discontinuation. 
Approximately 88% of the patients in the Phase 2/3 trials (2309 patients) is reported to have been treated for 
at least 28 days during the time period from Spring equinox to Fall equinox per hemisphere (approximately six 
months with at least 12 hours of day light per day and 52% (1372 patients) were treated for at least 28 days 
during the time period from Summer solstice to Fall equinox per hemisphere (approximately three months of 
summer).  Using exact binomial probability calculations, the Applicant estimate the probability to be at least 
95% to observe a photosensitivity reaction in at least one subject in the 6 month period or the 3 month period 
if the rates of these reactions were 0.0013 and 0.0022, respectively. 
Based on the above information it is concluded that there is no large concern regarding a risk for photosensitivity 
reactions associated with treatment using the 3DAA regimen. No additional phototoxicity testing is asked for. 
Dependence 
No drug dependence studies were submitted. Since ABT-450 as well as ABT-267 has no or very low distribution 
to the brain, and there was no evidence of effects on the central nervous system in pivotal toxicology studies, no 
drug dependence studies are considered necessary.  
Metabolites 
Two  pharmacologically  inactive,  disproportionate  human  metabolites  (M29  and  M36)  were  evaluated  in  a 
combined  toxicology  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  study  in  mice,  as  well  as  in  in  vitro  genotoxicity  tests  and  an 
embryo-foetal development study in mice. Both M29 and M36 were negative in GLP in vitro Ames tests and 
chromosomal aberration assays. M29 caused no adverse effects in any of the in vivo studies up to the highest 
tested exposures (15.8-18.1 µg·h/mL in the 1-month study, 17.4 µg·h/mL in the embryo-foetal development 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014

study), corresponding to RHD margins of 23.5-27x. In the 1-month study with M36, there were no adverse 
findings up to the highest exposure tested (16.8 µg·h/mL), corresponding to a margin of 38.2x.  
In the mouse embryo-foetal development toxicity study with M36, there was a slightly higher incidence of a 
visceral variation (increased incidence of renal pelvic cavitation) at the mid and high dose levels (litter incidence: 
5.9%, 9.5%, 15%, 21.1% in ctrl, low, mid and high dose groups, respectively). The Applicant provided historical 
control data, demonstrating that the foetal incidence of renal pelvic cavitation was within the historical control 
range. The litter incidence was above that seen historically (21.1% in the high dose group versus 12.5% upper 
end of control range). However, based on the presence of this variation in the concurrent controls as well as the 
rather  high  historical  control  incidence  it  is  evident  that  renal  pelvic  cavitation  occurs  commonly  in  mice. 
Furthermore, this variation is considered to represent a delay in maturity that will eventually catch up and is not 
considered  to  be  and  adverse  effect.  Thus,  the  NOAEL  (maternal  and  foetal)  in  study  R&D/13/549  was  6 
mg/kg/day, (margin to RHD 26.4x).  
In conclusion, it is considered that the safety of the human metabolites M29 and M36 of ABT-267 has been 
adequately characterized. With the exception of M36 and its possible effects on foetal development, the totality 
of nonclinical data indicate that the metabolites are unlikely to pose a toxicity risk at the recommended ABT-267 
daily dose of 25 mg for the 12- or 24-week treatment of chronic HCV infection. 
Impurities 
The toxicological qualifications of the specified ABT-450- and ABT-267-impurities as suggested by the applicant 
are endorsed. The previous qualification of the ritonavir impurities is considered also to be valid for the specified 
ritonavir impurities present in Viekirax as justified by the applicant. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based  on  the  previous  environmental  risk  assessment  performed  for  Kaletra  film-coated  tablets  200  mg 
lopinavir/50 mg ritonavir the presence of ritonavir in Viekirax is considered unlikely to represent a risk to the 
environment. 
The Applicant has performed a screening tier (Phase I) and subsequent Phase II -Tier A and Tier B evaluations 
for both Ombitasvir (ABT-267) and Paritaprevir (ABT-450) according to the “Guideline on Environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1*).  
Paritaprevir 
Paritaprevir  (ABT-450)  is  not  considered  a  PBT  substance  as  Logkow  is  below  4.5.  A  potential  for 
bioaccumulation can, however, not be excluded as the LogKow is 3.1 and the bioaccumulation potential needs 
to be determined either by the performing the OECD 305 study or by using a weight-of-evidence approach. A 
phase  II  Tier  B  assessment  was  triggered  as  the  aerobic  and  anaerobic  transformation  in  aquatic  sediment 
systems  study  (OECD  308)  showed  that  more  than  10%  of  the  substance  was  present  in  sediment.  The 
sediment-water chironomid toxicity test using spiked sediment (OECD 218) is still ongoing. 
Ombitasvir 
A  phase  II  Tier  B  terrestrial  compartment  assessment  is  required  for  Ombitasvir  (ABT-267)  as  the 
adsorption-desorption study (OECD 106) yielded a Koc value (35413 L/Kg) that is above the threshold. The 
sediment-water chironomid toxicity test using spiked sediment (OECD 218) is ongoing and will been submitted 
as soon as finalized. An aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308) study

has been performed, however the DT50 values have not been provided for the sediment and the applicant is 
requested to submit these values. The bioaccumulation study in fish (OECD 305) is currently ongoing and the 
final report will be submitted. 
In  conclusion  an  updated  ERA  will  be  submitted  for  both  paritaprevir  and  ombitasvir  as  a  post  approval 
recommendation. The applicant has indicated that the final reports and the updated ERA will be provided in April 
2015.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
ABT-450 (ABT-450) and ABT-267 (ombitasvir) have nanomolar to subnanomolar activity against genotypes 1 
and 4 and are indicated to be specific for viral targets. The four most significant metabolites of ABT-267 were 
concluded not to be pharmacologically active. No secondary pharmacological targets were identified in the in 
vitro screening performed, although a significant effect of ABT-450 was seen on the δ-opioid receptor δ2 (DOP). 
However, considering the low distribution to the brain and that ABT-450 is a substrate for both MDR-1 (PgP) and 
BCRP and also have a high plasma protein binding (>95%), an interaction with the δ-opioid receptor δ2 (DOP) 
is considered to be unlikely. This conclusion is also supported by the absence of any CNS effects in the safety 
pharmacology and repeat dose toxicology studies performed. 
No safety issues were identified in the non-clinical safety pharmacology studies performed and no additional 
non-clinical investigations are considered to be needed. 
Both ABT-450 and ABT-267 have low solubility and low bioavailability. ABT-450 is co-dosed with ritonavir, a 
potent CYP and efflux transport inhibitor in order to mitigate the high first-pass and hepatic elimination.  The 
pharmacokinetics of ritonavir is considered to be known and have not been assessed in this application. Oral 
absorption  of  ABT-450  in  rats  is  low  but  increases  when  ABT-450  and  ritonavir  is  co-dosed.  The  improved 
absorption  is  likely  due  to  inhibition  of  both  CYP  mediated  first-pass  metabolism  and  intestinal  efflux 
transporters  by  ritonavir.  ABT-450  oral  systemic  bioavailability  was  non-detectable  in  rat  and  monkey,  and 
averaged 41% in dog while the oral bioavailability for ABT-267 ranged from 25% in rat to 57% in dog with a PEG 
solution formulation.  ABT-267 plasma concentrations following oral co-dosing with ritonavir in rat, dog and 
monkey were comparable to those obtained from an equivalent dose of ABT-267 administered alone in each 
species. Although interactions between ABT-450 and ritonavir are expected this indicate that there are no large 
pharmacokinetic interactions between ABT-450/ritonavir and ABT-267. 
Plasma protein binding is high for both compounds and no partioning to red blood cells were seen. A limited 
distribution of radioactivity to tissues was seen in pigmented male Long-Evans rats given ABT-450/ritonavir and 
the liver was shown to contain the highest amount of radioactivity relative to other tissues. No retention was 
seen and no preferential binding of radioactivity to eye(s) or non-pigmented skin (low amounts were detected in 
pigmented skin). No distribution to brain tissues was seen.  Small amounts of  radioactivity were detected in 
foetal liver and ABT-450-derived radioactivity was excreted in milk obtained from lactating rats. ABT-267 was 
more widely distributed. Highest concentrations of radioactivity were found in adrenal gland, liver, pancreas, 
kidney  cortex  and  stomach  mucosa.    Concentrations  of  radioactivity  in  tissues  declined  below  the  limits  of 
quantitation  by  168  hr.  post-dose.  ABT-267-derived  radioactivity  did  not  preferentially  bind  to  the 
melanin-containing tissues and did not distribute into the lens of the eye or CNS tissues. Low amounts were 
detected in eye(s) and no differences between pigmented and non-pigmented skin was seen. Radioactivity was 
detected in the foetal liver and in milk from lactating rats.

A CYP-mediated oxidation of ABT-450 was seen and following a single oral dose of ABT-450 M2 was the major 
circulating metabolite in human plasma (~23% of total drug). The level was significantly reduced (to ~2.4% of 
total  drug)  when  ABT-450  was  co-dosed  with  ritonavir  (ABT-450/r  300/100  mg)  and  unchanged  parent 
accounted for the remaining drug-related material in plasma (97.6% of the total). No major metabolites were 
thus identified after administration of ABT-450/ritonavir. ABT-267 showed limited hepatic metabolism across 
species and was metabolized to a low extent and at a slow rate by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8. In humans, ABT-267, 
M23, M29, M36 and M37 are the main components in plasma after a single dose of ABT-267 alone, representing 
about 93% of total plasma radioactivity. M23 is present in preclinical species at higher levels than in humans, 
providing safety coverage in all toxicology species. M29, M36 and M37 are downstream metabolites of M23 but 
have not been observed in hepatic in vitro systems or in plasma or excreta of in vivo preclinical animals. M29 and 
M36 were defined as major disproportionate metabolites and specific toxicological studies have been performed 
with these two metabolites. Metabolite M37 is reported to be present in human plasma at a level just below 10% 
(9.3%) and the possibility that this metabolite might be a major metabolite in some individuals has not been 
addressed by the applicant. However, based on the absence of pharmacological activity and the results from the 
toxicological studies with M29 and M36 together with the low levels found in plasma of humans and the similarity 
in  structures  any  specific  safety  concerns  due  to  the  metabolite  M37  as  compared  to  the  other  two  major 
metabolites is considered to be unlikely. 
Following  oral  administration  of  ABT-450/r,  ritonavir  or  ABT-267  to  nonclinical  species  and  humans,  all 
compounds and their respective metabolites were mainly cleared via biliary excretion and faecal elimination, 
with minimal renal clearance. Parent compounds as well as metabolites were detected in milk from lactating rats 
after oral administration of ABT-450/ritonavir and ABT-267, respectively. 
The choice of nonclinical species is considered acceptable. In addition the performance of toxicological studies 
with the two major metabolites M29 and M36 present in human plasma at levels above 10%, but not with M37 
which is reported to be present at a level of 9.3% in pooled plasma, is also considered acceptable since no 
specific safety concern regarding M37 is to be expected based on the low plasma concentrations and structural 
similarity. 
In accordance with scientific advice received, ABT-267 and ABT-450 were evaluated separately in the toxicology 
studies. No combination repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted. Since no significant overlapping toxicity was 
identified in the single-agent studies, this is considered acceptable. ABT-267 administered orally up to 3 months 
in rats and 6 months in mice and dogs, respectively, did not cause any adverse effects at saturating systemic 
exposures. The only toxicity observed was single cell hepatocellular necrosis and increased liver enzymes in a 
non-GLP  14-day  mouse  study  (estimated  margin  to  NOAEL:  2.7x).  Non-adverse  effects  in  the  repeat  dose 
toxicity  studies  comprised  lymph  vessel  dilatation  and  vacuolation  in  the  small  intestine  (dog),  vaginal 
mucification and increased ovarian follicular cysts (mouse), increased liver weights with or without correlation to 
hepatocellular  vacuolation  (dog),  changes  in  body  weight  (mouse)  and  alterations  in  red  blood  cell  and 
coagulation parameters (dog). Overall, the margin to predicted human exposure associated with a 25 mg daily 
dose (1.42 µg·h/mL) and NOAELs in the ABT-267 repeat-dose toxicity studies are in the range of 20-50x. 
Oral administration of ABT-450/r for up to 3 months in rats, 6 months in mice and 9 months in dogs, resulted in 
adverse effects on the gallbladder (erosion/ulceration, inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia) in mice and dogs. 
The clinical exposure margin to NOAEL for these effects is 4.8x in the mouse and 29.4x in the dog. The 
mechanism behind the observed gallbladder findings is not known, but may conceivably be related to the high 
biliary excretion of ABT-450 with associated high local concentrations in the gallbladder. Review of the 3DAA 
Phase 2/3 data set revealed no evidence of treatment-related gallbladder disorders in humans. Thus, the 
non-clinical gallbladder findings appear not to be readily translatable to the clinical situation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 41/150 
  
  
Non-adverse effects in the repeat dose toxicity studies comprised diffuse intrasinusoidal vacuolation in the liver 
(dog), vacuolation in the small intestine and renal tubular epithelium (dog) and increased food consumption 
(mice).  Non-adverse  findings  of  equivocal  relationship  to  treatment  with  ABT-450  included  alterations  in 
coagulation parameters (dog) and increased serum bilirubin (mice). Overall, the margins to predicted human 
exposure associated with a 150 mg daily dose (7.0 µg·h/mL) and NOAELs in the ABT-450 repeat-dose toxicity 
studies are in the range of 4.8-87.8x. 
In all repeat-dose toxicity studies with ABT-450, ritonavir was co-administered as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. 
Effects  related  to  ritonavir  were  observed  in  the  liver  (increased  organ  weight,  hepatocellular  hypertrophy, 
multinucleated hepatocytes, mononuclear cell infiltration, focal necrosis), and thyroid gland (follicular epithelial 
hypertrophy).  There  were  also  ritonavir-related  effects  on  erythroid  parameters  and  (in  dogs)  the 
gastrointestinal system. All of these effects have previously been observed in nonclinical toxicity studies with 
ritonavir. The margin to clinical exposure at RHD is < 2x for liver effects in rats.  Considering that the majority 
of  ritonavir-related  findings  in  the  ABT-450/r  studies  is  of  adaptive  character  and  can  be  regarded  as 
non-adverse, and also that there is long clinical experience with ritonavir, this small margin to RHD is considered 
acceptable.  
ABT-267 tested negative in a complete package of genotoxicity studies, including tests for gene mutations and 
chromosomal aberrations in vitro and chromosomal aberrations in vivo. There were no significant increases in 
neoplastic changes due to ABT-267 treatment in a  6-month Tg-rasH2 mouse  carcinogenicity study at doses 
<150 mg/kg/day (26x clinical exposure based on AUC).  However,  since the rat carcinogenicity study is still 
ongoing it is not possible to conclude on the carcinogenic potential of ABT-267 at the moment. 
In the in vitro genotoxicity assays, ABT-450 tested negative for gene mutations but positive for chromosomal 
aberrations  in  human  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes.  Two  follow-up  in  vivo  genotoxicity  studies  (rat  bone 
marrow micronucleus, Comet assay on rat liver) were negative. The weight of evidence indicates that ABT-450 
does not carry a significant genotoxic risk. There were no significant increases in neoplastic changes due to 
ABT-450 treatment in a 6-month Tg-rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study at doses < 300 mg/kg/day (38x the 
clinical exposure based on AUC). In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, there was an increased incidence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma in males at the mid and high dose as compared with the concurrent control group. The 
Applicant provided historical control data, demonstrating that the incidence of the combined mid and high dose 
groups might be considered to be within or at least close to the historical control range. Based on these data, and 
the  absence  of  hepatocellular  carcinoma  in  female  rats  and  TgHras  mice,  and  also  considering  the  present 
indication and short duration of treatment, the apparently increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in 
males is concluded to be without clinical relevance.     
 Complete packages of reproductive toxicology studies were conducted for both ABT-267 and ABT-450. None of 
the  compounds  caused  any  effects  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  in  mice  (ABT-267)  or  rats 
(ABT-450/r). In the embryo-foetal development studies, possible teratogenic effects were observed with both 
compounds.  ABT-267  caused  increased  incidences  of  open  eye  lid  in  mice  (no  clear  dose  response),  and 
microphthalmia and absent incisors in rabbits at the high dose level. There were also foetuses with multiple 
craniofacial malformations in both studies. It should be noted that these effects occurred in the absence of any 
maternal toxicity, and at low exposure margins (4x) relative to RHD in the rabbit. Thus, there is a concern for the 
use of ABT-267 in pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential. The SmPC text under sections 4.6 and 5.3 
has been revised accordingly. No additional risk minimization measures are considered necessary.  
Embryo-foetal development studies with ABT-450/r were conducted in two rodent species, the mouse and the 
rat, due to vehicle-related intolerance and lack of appreciable exposure despite investigation of both oral and 
parenteral formulation in rabbits. This is considered acceptable. In the mouse study, increased incidences were

observed in ABT-450/r-treated groups for the malformation open eye lids. Although there was no clear dose 
response, a relationship to treatment with ABT-450/r cannot be excluded. Thus, there is a concern for the use 
of ABT-450 in pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential. The SmPC text under sections 4.6 and 5.3 has 
been revised accordingly. No additional risk minimization measures are considered necessary.  
In the ABT-450/r rat embryo-foetal development study, the only findings were slightly increased, statistically 
non-significant incidences of total visceral (>100/15 mg/kg/day) and skeletal variations (> 30/15 mg/kg/day). 
The increase in visceral variations was mainly due to higher incidence of dilated ureters and increased renal 
pelvic cavitation, within or slightly above the historical control range. Incidences of specific skeletal variations 
were within the historical control range, except for misaligned sternebrae, which were marginally above the 
historical control range for litter incidence. Due to the small magnitude of these effects, they are not considered 
adverse.  
In the ABT-267 prenatal and postnatal development study in mice, there were no findings except for two F1 
mortalities at 200 mg/kg/day during the post-weaning period. No effects related to ABT-450/r were observed in 
the prenatal and postnatal development study in rats. 
No  juvenile  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted.  Since  the  indication  applied  for  is  in  adults  only,  this  is 
considered acceptable. 
No separate local tolerance studies were conducted with ABT-267 or ABT-450/r. Since the intended therapeutic 
route  is  oral,  local  tolerance  can  be  evaluated  within  the  frame  of  general  toxicity  studies.  Accordingly,  no 
separate 
local  tolerance  studies  are  required.  In  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  with  ABT-450/r, 
erosions/ulcerations and inflammation in the gallbladder occurred in mice and dogs, most likely reflecting high 
local concentrations of the test compound in bile with associated local irritative effects. 
ABT-267 and ABT-450 absorb light between 290 and 700 nm and have maximal molar extinction coefficients 
(MECs) that exceed the guideline threshold of 1000 mol-1 cm-1. ABT-267 distributed to the skin and, at low 
concentrations, to the eyes. ABT-450/r distributed at low concentrations to pigmented skin, but not to the eyes. 
ABT-267 was not phototoxic in a 3-day in vivo study in hairless mice at doses < 200 mg/kg/day (8x the clinical 
exposure  based  on  AUC).  No  in  vitro  or  in  vivo  phototoxicity  studies  were  performed  with  ABT-450.  The 
Applicant refers to clinical data, demonstrating that there were no serious adverse events and no discontinuation 
of treatment due to a photosensitivity event. Based on this, the Applicant concluded that no risk minimization 
measures are warranted for the 3DAA or 2DAA combinations to prevent phototoxicity-related adverse events in 
humans. 
The  performed  clinical  trials  included  the  summer  months  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  there  were  no 
restrictions on sun exposure or requirements for sun protection or use of sunscreen. Results obtained suggest 
that the higher frequency of rash-related events in the 3DAA + RBV treatment groups was primarily due to the 
presence of RBV. In addition, a low and comparable incidence of photosensitivity preferred terms (non-serious, 
mild in severity and not leading to study drug discontinuation) was identified for the 3DAA+RBV regimen and 
placebo. 
Approximately 88% of the patients in the Phase 2/3 trials (2309 patients) were reported to have been treated 
for at least 28 days during the time period from Spring equinox to Fall equinox per hemisphere (approximately 
six months with at least 12 hours of day light per day and 52% (1372 patients) were treated for at least 28 days 
during the time period from Summer solstice to Fall equinox per hemisphere (approximately three months of 
summer).  Using exact binomial probability calculations, the Applicant estimate the probability to be at least 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 43/150 
 
  
  
95% to observe a photosensitivity reaction in at least one subject in the 6 month period or the 3 month period 
if the rates of these reactions were 0.0013 and 0.0022, respectively. 
Based on the above information it is concluded that there is no large concern regarding a risk for photosensitivity 
reactions associated with treatment using the 3DAA regimen. 
No dedicated immunotoxicology studies have been conducted with ABT-267 or ABT-450/r. Since the results of 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies do not indicate any significant effects on the immune system related to ABT-267 
or ABT-450/r, this is considered acceptable.  
No drug dependence studies were submitted. Since ABT-450 as well as ABT-267 has no or very low distribution 
to the brain, and there was no evidence of effects on the central nervous system in pivotal toxicology studies, no 
drug dependence studies are considered necessary.  
Two  pharmacologically  inactive,  disproportionate  human  metabolites  (M29  and  M36)  were  evaluated  in  a 
combined  toxicology  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  study  in  mice,  as  well  as  in  in  vitro  genotoxicity  tests  and  an 
embryo-foetal development study in mice. Both M29 and M36 were negative in GLP in vitro Ames tests and 
chromosomal aberration assays. M29 caused no adverse effects in any of the in vivo studies up to the highest 
tested exposures (RHD margins of 23-38x). In the mouse embryo-foetal development toxicity study with M36, 
there was a slightly higher incidence of a visceral variation (increased incidence of renal pelvic cavitation) at the 
mid and high dose levels. The Applicant provided historical control data, demonstrating that the foetal incidence 
of  renal  pelvic  cavitation  was  within  the  historical  control  range.  The  litter  incidence  was  above  that  seen 
historically (21.1% in the high dose group versus 12.5% upper end of control range). However, based on the 
presence of this variation in the concurrent controls as well as the rather high historical control incidence it is 
evident  that  renal  pelvic  cavitation  occurs  commonly  in  mice.  Furthermore,  this  variation  is  considered  to 
represent a delay in maturity that will eventually catch up and is not considered to be and adverse effect.  
In conclusion, it is considered that the safety of the human metabolites M29 and M36 of ABT-267 has been 
adequately characterized. With the exception of M36 and its possible effects on foetal development, the totality 
of nonclinical data indicate that the metabolites are unlikely to pose a toxicity risk at the recommended ABT-267 
daily dose of 25 mg for the 12- or 24-week treatment of chronic HCV infection. 
The toxicological qualifications of the specified ABT-450- and ABT-267-impurities as suggested by the applicant 
are endorsed. The previous qualification of the ritonavir impurities is considered also to be valid for the specified 
ritonavir impurities present in Viekirax as justified by the applicant. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical documentation is comprehensive and studies have been conducted in accordance with relevant 
guidelines and GLP. The Applicant has sought scientific advice for the non-clinical program, and followed the 
recommendations received.  
The non-clinical part of the dossier is considered to be sufficient. No major deficiencies have been identified. An 
updated ERA will be submitted for both paritaprevir and ombitasvir as a post approval recommendation. The 
applicant has indicated that the final reports and the updated ERA will be provided in April 2015.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
ABT-450 
In  the  current  application,  ABT-450/r  will  be  given  in  combination  in  a  3-DAA  regimen  with  ombitasvir  and 
dasabuvir or in a 2-DAA regimen with ombitasvir. Except for three single doses of ABT-450 (300, 600 and 900 
mg)  administered  in  the  first-in-human  study,  ABT-450  has  been  administered  with  the  pharmacokinetic 
enhancer ritonavir. 
Absorption  
The oral bioavailability of ABT-450 at 150 mg is approximately 50% (ranging from 35% to 71%). ABT-450 tmax 
occurred  approximately  4  to  5  hours  following  single  and  multiple  oral  dosing  with  the  co-formulated 
ABT-450/r/ombitasvir tablets at the 150/100/25 mg dose with and without dasabuvir in the non-fasting state. 
ABT-450 has low solubility.  
Food increases the bioavailability of ABT-450 (up to 4 fold), which possibly could be explained by increased 
solubility.  All  Phase  1  to  3  studies  have  dosed  ABT-450/r  and  ombitasvir  with  food  and,  hence,  safety  and 
efficacy data from these studies take into account the higher exposures observed when administered with food.  
Different  formulations  of  ABT-450  were  used  during  development.  The  SDD  formulation  and  the  phase  3 
formulations  (co-formulated  ABT-450/r/ombitasvir)  differed  with  regards  to  the  exposure  of  ABT-450.  The 
co-formulated ABT-450/r/ombitasvir showed approx. 60% higher exposure of ABT-450 compared to the SDD 
formulation.  
ABT-450 is a substrate of the transporter P-gp and BCRP. 
Distribution 
ABT-450  is  approximately  97%  to  98.6%  bound  to  human  plasma  proteins  showing  no  concentration 
dependency. The protein binding do not differ between subjects with normal renal and hepatic function, and 
subjects with renal and hepatic impairment.  
The  blood-to-plasma  concentration  ratio  is  approximately  0.7  in  human  blood,  indicating  that  ABT-450  is 
preferentially distributed into the plasma compartment of whole blood. 
Metabolism 
ABT-450  was  shown  to  be  metabolised  via  CYP3A4/5  and  possibly  also  extrahepatic  CYP1A1  using  cDNA 
expressed recombinant CYP enzymes. However, only disappearance of parent was investigated.  Strong CYP3A 
inhibitors ritonavir and ketoconazole have confirmed that CYP3A is involved in vivo. An increase in the ABT-450 
exposure was also seen after dosing with gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitors as well as OATP1B inhibitor).  
Unchanged  parent  drug  was  the  major  component  (88.9%)  of  drug-related  radioactivity  in  plasma.  Five 
metabolites were identified in human plasma, including M2 (7.8% of total AUC), M29 (3.2% of total AUC), and 
trace levels of M3, M13 and M6.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 64/150 
  
  
In urine, hydrolysis product M13 was the major component, accounting for 8.6% of the administrated 
radioactive dose. In faeces, hydrolysis product M29 was the most abundant radiochemical component, 
representing approximately 60% of the administered dose, followed by M2 and co-eluting metabolites M3/M18.  
ABT-450 is a substrate of the liver uptake transporter OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. This was confirmed in vivo with 
the OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitor cyclosporine, which increased the exposure to ABT-450 by 72%.  
Elimination 
Following  dosing  of  ABT-450  with  ritonavir  mean  plasma  half-life  of  ABT-450  was  approximately  5.5  hours. 
Following a single oral dose of [14C]ABT-450/r, the majority of the administered radioactive dose (87.8%) was 
recovered in faeces and only 8.76% was recovered in urine after a single dosing. Unchanged ABT-450 recovered 
in faeces and urine represented about 1.2% of the radiochemical dose. ABT-450 likely undergoes enterohepatic 
recirculation. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
ABT-450 has non-linear pharmacokinetics and shows greater than proportional increase in exposure with dose. 
At a ritonavir dose of 100 mg, increasing the ABT-450 dose from 25 mg to 400 mg increased the mean 
dose-normalized ABT-450 Cmax and AUC by approximately 60- and 50-fold, respectively. This non-linearity was 
observed across formulations and in the presence of ombitasvir.  
The accumulation of ABT-450/r administered in combination with ombitasvir, with and without dasabuvir, was 
approximately 2-fold. Steady state was achieved within 7 to 11 days. 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of ABT-450/r in special populations has only been investigated in the combination DAA 
regimens, as described below. 
Interactions 
P-gp and BCRP were inhibited by ABT-450 in vitro with IC50 of 29 µM and 0.6 µM, respectively. Based on the 
maximum expected concentration in the intestinal lumen (78 µM) there is a risk for clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions of BCRP and P-gp in the gut. Based on systemic concentration *50 (1 µM) there is a risk for clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions due to BCRP inhibition. In the P-gp digoxin study, 2-DAA gave rise to a higher 
effect (36%) than 3-DAA (16%) with dasabuvir. ABT-450 also inhibited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro with 
IC50 values of 0.013 µM and 0.017 µM, respectively.  
Interaction studies with pravastatin and rosuvastatin have confirmed that inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP is 
observed in vivo as well. Pravastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) exposures were increased by 36% and 82% by 
concomitant 2- and 3-DAA treatment, respectively. ABT-450, ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir (M1) are all 
inhibitors of OATP1B1 and could contribute to this inhibition. The exposure to rosuvastatin (substrate of 
OATP1B1 and BCRP) increased by 160% and by 30% when co-treated with the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimen, 
respectively. These results show the in vivo BCRP inhibitory potential of ABT-450 and dasabuvir.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 65/150 
  
  
The risk for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions due to ABT-450 inhibition of competitive CYP inhibition via 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4 is considered low. No metabolism-dependent inhibitors (MBI) for any 
CYP except a weak signal for CYP3A4 were observed.  
ABT-450 is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 with an IC50 of 3.6 µM. This inhibitory effect was confirmed in an interaction 
study with ABT-450/r, ombitasvir and dasabuvir (the DAAs also being UGT1A1 inhibitors) and the UGT1A1 
substrate raltegravir.  
ABT-450 induced CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA in human hepatocytes, indicating that ABT-450 might affect PXR 
and CAR pathways. In combination with ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir induction was however only 
observed in vivo for CYP2C19. 
In vivo interactions  
Please see the section describing the in vivo interaction for the combination DAAs/r. 
Ombitasvir 
Ombitasvir will be administered in combination in a 3-DAA regimen with ABT-450/ritonavir and dasabuvir or in 
a 2-DAA regimen with ABT-450/ritonavir. The studies that have been performed with ombitasvir as a single DAA 
include an ADME studies, a single-ascending dose study, a multiple-ascending dose study and in vitro assays. All 
other studies were performed as combination DAA studies with ABT-450/ritonavir ± dasabuvir.  
Absorption 
Ombitasvir has an oral bioavailability of approximately 50%. The compound is absorbed with a tmax occurring 
approximately  5  h  following  single  oral  dosing  of  the  co-formulated  ABT-450/r/ombitasvir  tablet  (to-be 
marketed formulation) with food. There is no data on the absolute bioavailability of ombitasvir. Poor solubility 
and seemingly low in vitro permeability of the compound suggest that ombitasvir is not completely absorbed. 
Food increases the exposure to ombitasvir approximately 2-fold, which possibly could be explained by increased 
solubility. All Phase 1 to 3 studies have dosed ombitasvir with food and, hence, safety and efficacy data from 
these studies take into account the higher exposures observed when administered with food. These are also the 
recommendations given by the Applicant in the SmPC. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding, investigated over a concentration range covering the therapeutic concentrations of 
ombitasvir, is on average 99.9% and does not differ between subjects with different degree of renal function. In 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the unbound fraction of ombitasvir increased 2.24-fold. 
Elimination 
Ombitasvir was best described by a two-compartment model in the PPK model. It has a terminal t½ ranging from 
approximately 18 h to 26 h. 
Ombitasvir  is  mainly  eliminated  unchanged  via  the  hepatobiliary  route.  Following  an  oral  dose  of  [14C] 
ombitasvir, ~90% of the dose was recovered in faeces (~88% as parent compound) and ~2% of the dose was 
recovered in urine (several minor unidentified metabolites). The specific transport pathways for hepatic uptake 
and  biliary  efflux  of  ombitasvir  remain  uncertain.  The  Applicant  is  encouraged  to  identify  the  transport 
mechanisms for hepatic uptake and efflux. This issue will however not be pursued since ombitasvir has been well 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 66/150 
  
  
tolerated  at  doses  up  to  200 mg  for  12  weeks  (refer  to  section  3.4.1. The  dose  selection  of  regimen 
components). In addition, co-administration with potent inhibitors such as cyclosporine, atazanavir/ritonavir 
and ketoconazole do not significantly affect the exposure to ombitasvir. 
Ombitasvir was stable in both human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Upon incubation with cDNA expressed 
recombinant  enzymes  some  turnover  of  ombitasvir  was  observed  with  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C8.  In  plasma,  the 
major circulating components were unchanged ombitasvir and the metabolites M29, M36, M37 and M23. These 
four metabolites have negligible viral activity compared to ombitasvir. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
There was no statistically significant non-proportional effect when increasing the dose of ombitasvir from 1.5 mg 
to 200 mg. However, there seemed to be a tendency towards greater-than proportional increase at the doses up 
to 50 mg, which possibly could be caused by saturation of efflux transport proteins in the intestine and/or liver. 
Saturation of an uptake mechanism and/or elimination pathway may explain that the effect of ABT-450/r was 
greater on a 25 mg dose of ombitasvir compared to a 200 mg dose of ombitasvir.  
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir in special populations has only been investigated in the combination DAA 
regimens, as described below. 
Interactions 
The  inhibition  potential  of  ombitasvir  was  investigated  for  the  most  common  CYP  isoenzymes,  UGT1A1  and 
several  uptake  and  efflux  transporters.  Ombitasvir  inhibited  UGT1A1  with  an  IC50  of  ~2 µM,  suggesting  an 
effect of intestinal UGT1A1. This inhibitory effect was confirmed in an interaction study with ABT-450/r and 
dasabuvir (the other DAAs also being UGT1A1 inhibitors) and the UGT1A1 substrate raltegravir. Ombitasvir also 
inhibited CYP2C8, but at the recommended dose of 25 mg ombitasvir is not expected to affect CYP2C8 in vivo 
(IC50  7.4 µM).  At  a  higher  dose  level  (200 mg)  ombitasvir  seemed  to  increase  the  exposure  to  dasabuvir 
(cross-study comparison), which could be attributed to its inhibitory effect on CYP2C8. In vitro there was also a 
signal of induction of CYP2B6 mRNA levels, and at a high dose of ombitasvir (200 mg) the exposure to ABT-450 
was reduced in vivo upon co-administration. The inducing effect of ombitasvir was, however, not observed at the 
clinically relevant dose. 
In vivo interactions  
See section describing the In vivo interaction for the DAA combination regimen. 
Pharmacokinetic  information  of  the  DAA  combination  in  the  target  population  and  special 
populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of Phase I/II and Phase III data suggested cirrhosis, sex, age, concomitant 
medication with opioids and anti-diabetics to be statistically significant predictors of ABT-450 CL. Significant 
covariates  pertaining  to  ombitasvir  CL  were  cirrhosis,  sex,  age  and  weight.  Females  had  higher  exposures 
(AUC24,ss) to the DAAs compared to males: the highest increase of exposure was for ABT-450 (~100% higher), 
followed  by  ombitasvir  (~55%  higher),  ribavirin  (~30%  higher),  dasabuvir  (≤  30%  higher),  and  ritonavir 
(~15% higher). There were no indications of an altered DAA exposure in Asians; Black and Hispanic/Latinos. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 67/150 
 
  
  
The effects of the covariates were not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment based on gender, 
age, weight and race is warranted. ABT-450 and ombitasvir can be used irrespective of renal function but are 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Exposure associated with clinical response (efficacy and safety) 
Phase II data suggest no impact on SVR rates when the ABT-450 exposure was reduced by 50%. Similarly 
ombitasvir monotherapy data suggest that Emax is reached at a dose of 25 mg without ritonavir, which is 
equivalent to an exposure 50% lower compared to the Phase 3 exposure. 
Multivariate logistic regression of Phase III data did not identify a significant correlation between exposure and 
response for ABT-450 or dasabuvir, which implies that the dose of these two compounds corresponds to Emax. 
A correlation was identified for ombitasvir, however, the potential change in SVR associated with a 50% 
reduction is expected to be small. In addition, a simulation study using a semi-mechanistic model of viral 
dynamics (ABT-450/r, ABT-267 and ABT-333 Exposure-Viral Load Response Report R&D/13/1069) did not show 
a significant difference in SVR when all components (ABT-450, ombitasvir and dasabuvir) were reduced by 50%. 
Exposure-safety response modeling of phase II data was also conducted using multivariate logistic regression. 
ALT elevations and total bilirubin elevations were associated with increased ABT-450 and ribavirin exposures. 
However, based on the observed range of exposures a doubling of the predicted exposure appears acceptable. 
In vivo interactions with the 3-DAA or the 2-DAA combination regimen 
In the in vivo studies, all DAAs (2-DAA or 3-DAA combinations) are included and knowledge about the net effect 
of the two regimens is gained. This is satisfactory, but sometimes hinders mechanistic conclusions to be drawn 
for the individual compounds. Ritonavir affects a multitude of enzymes and transporters in a time dependent 
manner, and hence time dependent interactions are expected. 
Ribavirin 
The  combination  DAA  regimen  will  be  given  together  with  ribavirin  to  a  significant  proportion  of  patients. 
Ribavirin  is  not  hepatically  eliminated  and  is  not  expected  to  interact  with  the  DAAs  or  other  hepatically 
eliminated  compounds.  Consequently,  drug-interaction  studies,  thorough  QT  studies,  and  renal  and  hepatic 
impairment studies were conducted with the DAA combination without ribavirin. The influence of ribavirin on PK 
parameters was investigated in the PPK analysis, and the results did not show any relationship between use of 
ribavirin as covariate and CL/F of the DAAs. 
Ritonavir 
Ritonavir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, with a minor contribution from CYP2D6. The compound is also a 
substrate of P-gp. 
In vitro, ritonavir inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. No inhibitory effect was 
observed on CYP1A2. When the respective IC50 values were compared to the guideline cut off values, it was 
concluded that an in vivo effect of the in vitro inhibition could not be excluded for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The 
inhibition against CYP3A4 was shown to be time dependent. Ritonavir is also an inducer of several enzymes, and 
the net effect on the respective enzyme is dependent on which medicinal products ritonavir is administered 
together  with.  In  combination  with  ABT-450,  ombitasvir  and  dasabuvir  induction  was  only  observed  for 
CYP2C19. 
Ritonavir was not an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K and MRP2. In addition, it 
was concluded to be a negligible risk for systemic inhibition of BCRP by ritonavir, but potential inhibition at the 
intestinal level cannot be excluded. Ritonavir also inhibited P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. However, literature data suggest that ritonavir is not an in vivo inhibitor of OATP1B1.

Use of different ABT-450 formulations in the DDI studies 
Different ABT-450, ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir formulations have been used in DDI studies and Phase 3 
studies. Exposures of ombitasvir, dasabuvir and ritonavir are comparable across these formulations. However, 
the  exposure  to  ABT-450  following  administration  of  the  to-be-marketed  formulation  is  ~60%  higher 
bioavailability than the ABT-450 SDD tablet used in some of the DDI studies. Based on a mechanistic rational 
and  regression  analyses,  the  interaction  studies  performed  with  raltegravir,  pravastatin,  rosuvastatin, 
cyclosporine  and  tacrolimus  may  to  some  extent  have  underestimated  the  interaction  magnitude.  The 
recommendations for these interactions are adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Interaction between the individual components of the 3-DAA combination 
ABT-450/r reduced dasabuvir exposures by ~50% and increased ombitasvir exposures by ~50%. Ombitasvir 
(at a therapeutic dose) did not affect the exposure to ABT-450, and based on cross-study comparison did not 
seem  to  affect  dasabuvir  pharmacokinetics  to  any  clinically  relevant  degree.  Dasabuvir  increased  ABT-450 
exposures  by  ~50%,  but  did  not  affect  ombitasvir  exposures,  the  latter  conclusion  based  on  cross-study 
comparison. 
Interaction studies providing a mechanistic understanding 
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of the DAAs 
CYP3A4 and transporter inhibition (ketoconazole, cyclosporine and protease inhibitors) 
Ketoconazole:    The effect of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (at steady state; 400 mg QD for six 
days) on the pharmacokinetics of the 3- and 2-DAA combinations (single dose) and vice versa was investigated. 
Ketoconazole increased the exposure to ABT-450, ritonavir and ombitasvir by approximately 2-fold, 1.5-fold and 
1.2-fold,  respectively.  The  exposure  to  ketoconazole  increased  2-fold.  Given  the  time  dependent  effects  of 
ritonavir, it cannot be excluded that the contribution of CYP3A4 mediated metabolism to the total elimination of 
ABT-450 may differ depending on whether ABT-450/rtv is dosed as a single dose or is at steady state. Hence, 
the effect of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on ABT-450 at steady state remains uncertain. There are DDI studies with 
other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that were co-administered at steady state and where the exposure to ABT-450 
increased several-fold (e.g. see atazanavir/ritonavir below). As it cannot be excluded that the design of the 
ketoconazole study underestimated the effect of CYP3A4 inhibition on the exposure to ABT-450, a conservative 
approach  with  contraindication  for  concomitant  use  of  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  is  applied.  To  enable 
co-administration  with  an  anti-fungal  azole  during  treatment  with  Viekirax,  the  Applicant  is  encouraged  to 
perform a DDI study with a suitable azole (of note, both victim and perpetrator drugs should be at steady state). 
Cyclosporine:    The  combination  of  cyclosporine  A  (single  dose;  10 mg  or  30 mg)  with  the  3-  and  2-DAA 
combinations (at steady state) was investigated. The exposure to ABT-450 was increased by  approximately 
72%,  and  there  was  an  approximate  30%  reduction  in  the  exposure  to  dasabuvir  (~20%  reduction  of  its 
metabolite  M1).  Cyclosporine  is  classified  as  a  moderate  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and  is  also  an  inhibitor  of 
OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp and BCRP. The increased exposure to ABT-450 may be explained by the inhibitory actions 
of cyclosporine A, and the reduced exposure to dasabuvir could potentially be caused by inhibited intestinal 
uptake transporters. 
Protease inhibitors: Lopinavir/r and atazanavir increased the exposure to ABT-450 (by 2-to 6-fold), whereas 
darunavir both increased and decreased the exposure to ABT-450 depending on the combination of the DAAs as 
well  the  dosing  regimen  of  the  protease  inhibitor  (see  section  below  “DDI  studies  with  commonly 
co-administered HIV drugs”). In the cases where an increased exposure to ABT-450 was observed, the effect of 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 69/150 
 
  
  
the protease inhibitor is consistently higher for the 2-DAA regimen compared to the 3-DAA regimen. The greater 
effect  on  ABT-450  exposure  may  be  caused  by  the  combined  effect  of  inhibited  CYP3A4  and  transporters 
(OATP1B1/3, BCRP and/or P-gp) by atazanavir and lopinavir. 
CYP3A4 induction (carbamazepine) 
Carbamazepine:  In  the  presence  of  a  strong  CYP3A4  inducer,  carbamazepine  (200  mg  BID),  the 
concentrations of the DAAs were reduced: the decrease was 65% for ABT-450, 32% decrease for ombitasvir, 
70% decrease for dasabuvir and 38% for dasabuvir M1. Further, ritonavir exposure was decreased with 83% to 
87%. In this study, the 3-DAA combination was administered as a single dose in the form of co-formulated 
tablet. The carbamazepine study does not provide the worst case scenario, due to the use of single dosing of the 
DAA,  which  is  not  representative  of  the  DAAs  at  steady  state  (as  described  above).  The  use  of  strong  and 
moderate inducers is contraindicated in the SmPC. 
CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 inhibition (gemfibrozil) 
Gemfibrozil: In the presence of gemfibrozil (a mechanism based CYP2C8 inhibitor and OATP1B1 inhibitor) at 
steady state, the elimination of dasabuvir (given as a single dose in the 3-DAA regimen) was markedly reduced. 
The AUC of dasabuvir increased approx. 11-fold, and the metabolism to M1 was inhibited as evident from the 
78% reduction of M1 AUC. There was a 38% and a 21% increase in the AUC and Cmax, respectively, of ABT-450. 
The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir was unaffected. Due to the effect on dasabuvir, concomitant use of strong 
CYP2C8 is contraindicated when Viekirax is administered with dasabuvir. 
Other mechanism (tacrolimus) 
Tacrolimus: A single dose of tacrolimus gave rise to a small to moderate reduction of the exposure of ABT-450, 
ritonavir, dasabuvir and dasabuvir M1. For ABT-450 the decrease was up to 40%, this effect is not considered 
clinically relevant. 
Effects of the DAAs on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs  
CYP3A substrates (alprazolam, amlodipine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) 
In Viekirax, ritonavir is included as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of ABT-450. Based on the inhibitory actions of 
ritonavir on CYP3A4, co-administration with compounds that are dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and for 
which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events is contraindicated. 
Alprazolam:  The 3-DAA  combination at steady state and alprazolam were given alone and in combination. 
Alprazolam  AUC  was  increased  by  34%,  the  increased  exposure  to  alprazolam  is  probably  due  to  CYP3A4 
inhibition by ritonavir and possibly also by ABT-450. Compared to midazolam, alprazolam is not a very sensitive 
CYP3A4  substrate  due  to  its  limited  first-pass  metabolism.  Thus,  the  effect  on  a  more  sensitive  CYP3A4 
substrate  is  likely  higher.  In  the  SmPC  clinical  monitoring  of  alprazolam  is  recommended.  A  decrease  in 
alprazolam dose can be considered based on clinical response. 
Amlodipine:  When  multiple  doses  of  3-DAAs  were  co-administered  with  a  single  oral  dose  of  amlodipine 
besylate the amlodipine AUC increased 157%, while amlodipine harmonic mean t 1/2 increased from 42 hours to 
104 hours. Cmax increased by 26% in amlodipine. No change in DAAs was observed. 
Cyclosporine: Upon co-administration with the DAAs the dose normalised AUC of cyclosporine was increased 
4.3-fold by 2-DAA and 5.8-fold by 3-DAA. The effect of C24 was 3-fold higher that the effect on AUC. The half-life 
was increased from 8.7 h to 9.8 h (2-DAA), indicating that the major part of the DDI occurred during absorption 
and/or first pass extraction. When the 3-DAA regimen was administered, the half-life was increased from 7.3 h 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 70/150 
 
 
  
  
to 24.5 h. A reduction of the initial cyclosporine dose to 1/5 of the normal daily dose is proposed in the SmPC 
with a dosing frequency of once daily instead of twice daily. 
Tacrolimus: Dose normalised tacrolimus AUC was increased between 57- to 86-fold by the 3-DAA depending 
on the study design (tacrolimus given as single dose). Cmax and C24 of tacrolimus were decreased as well. The 
half-life increased up to 230 h. The study was not designed to investigate a full mutual interaction, i.e. obtaining 
steady state for all substances. An extensive accumulation is expected at multiple dose conditions of tacrolimus 
due to the quite long half-life. Administration of tacrolimus every week instead of BID is recommended.  The 
resulting plasma concentration-time course of and the exposure to tacrolimus may differ from when a CYP3A4 
inhibitor is not co-administered, however, there are clinical data on this combination. 
CYP2C19 substrates (omeprazole and escitalopram) 
Omeprazole:  Co-administration  of  omeprazole  with  the  DAAs  regimen  resulted  in  a  40-50  %  decrease  in 
omeprazole  exposure.  The  omeprazole  exposure  decrease  is  likely  a  consequence  of  CYP2C19  induction 
mediated by ritonavir. Omeprazole is also metabolised by CYP3A, which is inhibited by ritonavir. Hence, the 
inducing  effect  on  CYP2C19  may  be  more  marked  for  those  medicinal  products  where  CYP3A4  mediated 
metabolism do not contribute to the elimination. The net induction effect by the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimen on 
CYP2C19 is reflected in the SmPC. 
Escitalopram: The exposure of a single dose of escitalopram was increased by 13% and 25% when co-dosed 
with  the  2-  and  3-DAA  regimen,  respectively,  at  steady  state.  Escitalopram  is  metabolized  to 
S-desmethylcitalopram primarily by CYP2C19 and also by CYP3A and CYP1A2, and S-desmethylcitalopram is 
further metabolized by CYP2D6. Ritonavir can induce CYP2C19 and inhibit CYP2D6, while dasabuvir probably is 
a  weak  in  vitro  CYP2C19  inhibitor.  The  effect  of  the  2-  and  3-DAA  combination  on  escitalopram  and 
S-desmethylcitalopram could be the effect of ritonavir and dasabuvir on these enzymes. As single dosing of 
escitalopram was used, the effect at steady state could be different due to the time-dependent effect seen by 
ritonavir. 
CYP2C9 substrates (warfarin) 
S-warfarin: The study aimed at evaluating the steady-state effect of the DAAs on a single dose warfarin and 
vice versa. The study results showed that both the 3-DAA and 2-DAA combination decreased the AUC of S- and 
R warfarin by 12-16 %. The half-life of warfarin was also reduced (mainly for S-warfarin). Warfarin is a NTI drug 
and even a small change may be clinically significant.  Hence, it is recommended that INR should be monitored 
when  warfarin  is  co-administered  with  2-DAA  and  3-DAA  combinations.  Clinically  significant  DDIs  are  not 
expected with other CYP2C9 substrates. 
UGT1A1 substrates (raltegravir) 
Raltegravir: Raltegravir was co-administered at steady state with the DAAs. The effect on raltegravir exposure 
was  most  marked  with  the  3-DAA  combination,  which  increased  the  exposure  to  raltegravir  approximately 
2.5-fold. All DAAs are UGT1A1 inhibitors in vitro, therefore it is likely that several or all DAAs inhibits raltegravir’s 
glucuronidation. The effects of the DAAs on drugs that are metabolised by glucuronidation are reflected in the 
Viekirax SmPC. 
P-gp substrates (digoxin) 
Digoxin:  The  potential  for  the  2-DAA  or  3-DAA  regimen  (at  steady  state)  to  affect  P-gp  substrates  was 
investigated with digoxin (single dose; 0.5 mg) as a P-gp probe. The exposure to digoxin was increased by 16% 
and 36% in the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimen, respectively, whereas the terminal t½ seemed to be unaffected. 
Digoxin is not considered to be a sensitive probe for P-gp interaction mediated in the intestine. Hence, even 
though the increase in digoxin was relatively small the SmPC needs to reflect that the DAAs may increase the 
Assessment report

Page 71/150 
  
  
plasma  exposure  to  medicinal  products  that  are  sensitive  for  changed  intestinal  P-gp  activity  (such  as 
dabigatran etexilate).  
OATP1B1 and BCRP substrates (pravastatin and rosuvastatin)  
Pravastatin:  The effects of the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimen (at steady state) on pravastatin (10 mg) (single 
dose) were investigated. The exposure to pravastatin was increased approx. 1.8 fold in both DAA regimens, and 
the terminal t½ of the compounds remained unchanged. The pharmacokinetics of pravastatin is known to be 
affected by changes in OATP1B1 and/or MRP2 activity. There were no in vitro inhibitory effects of any of the 
DAAs on MRP2, and the interaction is therefore hypothesized to be mediated via OATP1B1. 
Rosuvastatin: The effects of the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimen (at steady state) on rosuvastatin (5 mg) (single 
dose) were investigated. The exposure to rosuvastatin was dependent on whether dasabuvir was included in the 
DAA regimen. In the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimen, the exposure to rosuvastatin was increased by 160% and 30%, 
respectively. The pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin is mainly affected by inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP. The 
greater effect on rosuvastatin in the 3-DAA regimen suggests that dasabuvir contributes to the BCRP inhibitory 
effect. 
Drug-drug interaction studies with commonly co-administered HIV drugs 
Protease inhibitors (lopinavir/r, darunavir, atazanavir) 
Lopinavir/ritonavir:  Lopinavir/ritonavir  (steady  state  800/200 mg  QD  and  400/100 mg  BID)  was 
investigated with DAA regimens. The exposure to ABT-450 increased in all treatment groups with a fold increase 
that  varied  between  1.9  and  6.1,  depending  on  both  which  DAA  combination  that  was  given  and  whether 
lopinavir/r was given BID or QD in the evening. The greatest effect on ABT-450 exposure (AUC increased 6-fold, 
Cmax increased 12-fold) was observed in the arm containing the 3-DAA regimen and lopinavir/r BID.  Since 
increased  exposure  to  ABT-450  is  associated  with  a  potential  risk  for  ALT  elevations,  the  combination  of 
lopinavir/r and the DAA regimen is not recommended. 
Darunavir:  The effect of the DAAs on darunavir (800 mg QD morning and 600 mg BID) and vice versa was 
investigated.  In an additional study, co-administration with darunavir/r (800/100 mg QD in the evening) was 
investigated.  The  mutual  interactions  were  investigated  when  all  study  drugs  were  at  steady  state.  The 
exposure to ombitasvir, dasabuvir and M1 were either comparably or decreased upon co-administration with 
darunavir. The greatest effects were observed on the exposure to ABT-450, but the results differed between the 
DAA combination as well as the PI regimen. 
Due  to  the  reduced  darunavir  concentrations,  this  combination  will  not  be  recommended  in  patients  with 
extensive PI resistance (which excludes the darunavir BID dosing as a treatment option). Also, for simplicity, the 
combination with darunavir should only be allowed when darunavir without ritonavir is administered at the same 
time together with the DAAs. 
Atazanavir: The effect of the DAAs on atazanavir (300 mg QD in the morning and 300/100 mg in the evening) 
and vice versa was investigated when all study drugs were at steady state. Atazanavir increased the exposure 
to ABT-450 between 2- and 3-fold. The greatest magnitude of interaction was observed when atazanavir/r was 
added QD in the evening to the 3-DAA regimen and when atazanavir (without ritonavir) QD was added to the 
2-DAA regimen (AUC increased ~3-fold). The increase in exposure to ABT-450 may be acceptable when the 
3-DAA regimen is combined with atazanavir (QD in the morning). The combination carries an increased risk for 
hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular icterus), and this information is reflected in the SmPC.

Other  co-administered  HIV  drugs  (emtricitabine,  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate,  efavirenz, 
rilpivirine, raltegravir) 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate:  The  effect  of  ABT-450/r+ombitasvir±dasabuvir  on 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (200/300 mg QD) and vice versa was investigated with all study 
drugs being at steady state. The exposure to emtricitabine was unchanged, whereas the exposure to tenofovir 
was  slightly  increased.  Based  on  what  is  known  about  the  inhibitory  effects  on  transporters  by  the  DAA 
combinations,  the  increased  tenofovir  exposure  could  possibly  be  caused  by  inhibition  of  intestinal  P-gp  or 
possibly BCRP (increasing absorption of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).  
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate:  The  combination  of  ABT-450/r+dasabuvir  and 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (600/200/300 mg  QD)  was  also  investigated,  but  this 
study had to be terminated due to treatment emergent increases in ALT levels (see further the clinical safety 
summary and discussion). 
Rilpivirine: The DAA combination regimen increased the exposure to rilpivirine (25 mg QD) approximately 2.5- 
to  3.2-fold  (all  study  drugs  administered  to  steady  state).  The  effect  of  the  DAAs  on  rilpivirine  was  more 
pronounced  than  what  is  reported  for  other  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors,  and  based  on  the  plasma 
concentration-time profile indicating enterohepatic recirculation of rilpivirine and the interaction profile of the 
DAAs, it can be hypothesized that other transporter pathways (potentially OATP inhibition) are involved in the 
interaction. Would an HIV protease inhibitor be added (atazanavir, darunavir) together with rilpivirine to the 
DAA regimen, rilpivirine exposure may increase even further (not recommended). Rilpivirine should be used 
cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring. 
Raltegravir: the study is described in section with UGT1A1 inhibition. The combination of raltegravir together 
with the DAA regimens was not linked to any particular safety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 
weeks, and may therefore be recommended. 
Drug-drug interaction studies with other commonly co-administered medicinal products 
Methadone: A DDI study was conducted with subjects, who were on stable methadone therapy. The study 
showed a minimal effect on the methadone exposure, and compared to historical controls methadone seemed to 
have minimal impact on ritonavir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and M1 exposures. However, data initially presented by 
the applicant suggested that the exposure to ABT-450 was significantly reduced. Methadone is an auto-inducer 
in vivo, but due to the difficulty in performing studies with methadone there are little in vivo DDI data on the 
compound. 
More pharmacokinetic data with the final formulation used in the study have now been gained, and when 
comparing these data with historical controls there were no clear difference in ABT-450 exposures. There is a 
marked inter-study difference in ABT-450 exposure and using historical controls is not a satisfactory approach 
for this compound. However, it is difficult to study this interaction without making comparisons with historical 
controls. The efficacy of the combination of the 3-DAA regimen with methadone has been evaluated in GT1 HCV 
patients taking methadone (n=19), the majority of these patients were treatment naïve, quite young and 
non-cirrhotic. 
Buprenorphine/naloxone: ABT-450/r and ABT267 with or without dasabuvir increased buprenorphin AUC by 
ca 40% (3-DAA) or 60% (2-DAA). The AUC of the metabolite norbuprenorphin increased by 82% (3-DAA) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 73/150 
 
 
  
  
by 111% (2-DAA). It is not understood why the absence of dasabuvir gives rise to these increases in exposure. 
This again indicates that there is induction when dasabuvir is present; either that dasabuvir is an inducer or that 
it increases the exposure of an inducer. Comparison of DAA exposure was made with historical controls. This 
approach is not adequate for this kind of high variability situation. No marked differences were observed. 
Zolpidem: A single dose of zolpidem decreased ABT-450 exposure by up to 37%. The mechanism behind this 
interaction is not known, but there is data in the literature that shows that zolpidem is a PXR activator in vitro. 
The reduction in ABT-450 exposure is not considered clinically relevant. 
Duloxetine: A single dose of duloxetine exposures were 17% to 25% lower when co-dosed with the 2-DAA or 
3-DAA regimen at steady state. Duloxetine is eliminated through oxidative metabolism via CYP1A2 and, to a 
lesser degree, CYP2D6. The effect of DAAs on duloxetine might be due to the mild CYP1A2 induction by ritonavir. 
Furosemide: The effect of 2-DAA and 3-DAA on furosemide pharmacokinetics (single dose) was investigated. 
There  was  no  effect  on  furosemide  AUC,  but  Cmax  was  increased  by  40%.  With  the  earlier  and  higher 
furosemide  peak  concentration,  caution  is  warranted  when  co-administering  furosemide  with  the  3-DAA 
regimen and monitoring of the clinical response is recommended.  
Oral contraceptives 
The interaction between ABT-450/r/ABT-267 with or without dasabuvir and  the COC EE + NGM (Ortho-Cyclen 
tablets) was investigated as well as  3-DAA with POP containing NET (Jolivette) and 3-DAA with COC containing 
EE + NET (Balziva) . Ortho Cyclen was administered for 21 days, Jolivette for 17 days and Balziva for 21 days. 
On  the  10th,  4  th  and  8th  day,  respectively,  the  DAA  treatment  started  and  was  continued  for  19,21  and  8 
(discontinued) days, respectively. The first and last contraceptive investigations were prematurely discontinued 
due  to  increased  transaminases.  Based  on  this  study  and  on  clinical  safety  data  analyses,  use  of  EE  is 
contraindicated. Based on available safety data, use of other estrogens is not restricted.  
Ortho-Cyclen (EE/NGM) 
The AUC24 of ABT-450 were ca. 30% reduced as 2-DAA and unchanged as 3-DAA (day 21 vs day 28) when 
combined with the COC. The exposure to ritonavir was 20-29% lower when used concomitantly with the COC 
(day  21).  Ombitasvir  was  unaffected.  AUC12  of  dasabuvir  were  ca.  50%  lower  when  dosed  with  the  COC. 
Correspondingly, M1 were similarly 37-46% reduced. 
The  exposure  to  norelgestromin  was  increased  by  ca  160%  when  co-administered  by  2-DAA  or  3-DAA, 
respectively. AUC of norgestrel (NG) was increased by ca.150% regardless of dasabuvir co-administration. The 
pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol (EE) was unaffected. This treatment was discontinued. The mechanism of 
the increase in progestin is unknown (it could be UGT inhibition) as well as the reason for the lower dasabuvir, 
M1 and ABT-450 exposure. 
Jolivette (NET) 
The exposure values of ABT-450 were approximately 25% higher (day 17 vs 24) when administering  NET POP. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  ritonavir,  ombitasvir  and  dasabuvir  was  largely  unaffected.  The  exposure  to 
norethindrone was somewhat reduced during the 3-DAA treatment.  
Balziva (EE/NET) 
This treatment was again discontinued early due to adverse events and thus the pharmacokinetic data set is 
imcomplete.  Through  concentration  comparisons  of  ritonavir  indicated  no  marked  change  in  exposure.  The 
exposure to ombitasvir seems to have been increased based on C24, but this could be due to accumulation 
during  multiple-dosing.  The  sparse  C24  data  on  dasabuvir  and  M1  did  not  indicate  a  marked  increase  in 
exposure.

The sparse C24 data on EE did not indicate a marked change in exposure. AUC24 was increased by 22%, from 
day 7 to day 8 (only 1 day together). The effect that would be obtained at steady state is unknown. The exposure 
to norethindrone was increased (AUC at day 4 29% increased) but the full extent is unknown.  
Knowing the mechanism of the decrease in DAA exposure would enable prediction of similar DDIs. At present, 
the  mechanism  is  unknown.  Up-regulation  of  hepatic  uptake  transporters  and  thereby  increased  hepatic 
exposure (possibly saturation of efflux transporters) could explain both reduced DAA exposure and higher risk 
of hepatic safety issues. Other mechanisms such as BSEP inhibition/down-regulation are also possible. 
Transaminases observed in DDI studies 
Inhibitors of the bile salt export pump (BSEP), such as glybenclamide, troglitazone and oestrogen have been 
associated with liver cholestasis (Paulis Magnus et al 2010). Both ABT-450 and ritonavir have been shown to be 
inhibitors of BSEP in vitro. Dasabuvir and is also an inhibitor in vitro but at 30-fold higher than clinically relevant 
concentrations. Oestrogen and progesterone metabolites are also trans-inhibitors of BSEP (Vallejo et al 2006). 
Testing of bile acids was performed in order to explore a possible relationship between changes in the levels of 
various bile acids in plasma and the observed changes in ALT levels. Total bile acid levels were measured as 
were the levels of ursodeoxycholic, cholic, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids. This testing was performed 
using available samples from subjects in Arms 1 and 2 and all subjects in Arm 4. Evaluation of these data did not 
demonstrate  any  trend.  There  is  a  post  approval  measure  (PAM)  on  a  safety  analysis  of  the  risk  of  raised 
transaminases if the 3DAAS are combined with a BSEP inhibitor. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action  
ABT-450 (ABT-450) is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the 
HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is 
essential for viral replication. 
Ombitasvir (ABT-267) is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A which is essential for viral replication.  
Dasabuvir (ABT-333) is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is an 
enzyme that catalyses the replication of the viral RNA. ABT-333 displays a novel mechanism of action, as the 
previously approved inhibitor of NS5B is a nucleotide analogue. 
Based on EC50s, no activity against HBV or HIV is anticipated for any of these three drugs. 
The in vitro activity of ABT-450 
Activity in biochemical assays 
ABT-450 is an inhibitor of the protease encoded by the NS3 and NS4A (cofactor) genes of HCV. This compound 
inhibited activity of purified NS3/4A protease enzymes from genotypes 1a, 1b and 4a with IC50 values between 
0.16 and 0.43 nM. 
For the purified NS3/4A protease enzymes derived from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b and 3a isolates, the IC 50 values 
were 2.4 to 14.5 nM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 75/150 
  
  
Activity in the replicon assay 
ABT-450 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons in cell culture assays with EC50 values of 1.0 and 
0.21 nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1, respectively. The EC50 value of ABT-450 against stable cell line 
replicons containing the NS3 genes from HCV genotype 3a, 4a or 6a was 19 nM, 0.09 nM or 0.68 nM, 
respectively; and the EC50 against the 2a JFH-1 strain replicon was 5.3 nM. The lower activity seen for 
macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitors against genotype 3 is likely due to a conserved polymorphism at the 168 position 
in NS3/4A which confers lower viral susceptibility. 
ABT-450 had a median toxic dose (TD50) of 37,000 nM in an MTT cytotoxicity assay, producing a therapeutic 
index that exceeded 37,000-fold. 
The in vitro activity of ABT-267 
As there is no known enzymatic function of NS5A, no studies with biochemical assays were reported. 
Activity in the replicon assay 
ABT-267 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons in cell culture assays with EC50 values of 14 pM and 
5 pM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1, respectively.  
The EC50 value of ABT-267 against stable cell line replicons containing NS5A from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, 
4a, 5a or 6a was 12.4, 4.3, 19.3, 1.7, 3.2 or 366 pM, respectively. 
The relatively similar EC50 values for all major HCV genotypes are noted. It is likely that ABT-267 might have 
been a valuable drug for the treatment of genotype 3; however, it will only be available co-formulated with a 
NS3/4A inhibitor with significantly reduced activity against this genotype (see above). Also, the lower activity 
against genotype 6a is noted. The molecular background for this has not been clarified. 
ABT-267 had a TD50 of > 32,000,000 pM in an MTT cytotoxicity assay, producing a therapeutic index that 
exceeded 2 million-fold. 
The in vitro activity of ABT-333 
Activity in biochemical assays  
ABT-333 is an inhibitor of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the NS5B gene of HCV. This 
compound inhibited purified recombinant NS5B polymerases derived from HCV genotype 1a and 1b isolates with 
IC50 values between 2.2 and 10.7 nM. 
ABT-333 had IC50 values of 900 nM or greater against purified polymerases derived from HCV genotypes 2a, 
2b, 3a, and 4a isolates. Thus, the activity of ABT-333 appears specific to genotype 1. For this reason, the drug 
has not been evaluated for use in other genotypes than this. 
Activity in the replicon assay  
ABT-333 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons in cell culture assays with EC50 values of 7.7 and 1.8 
nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1, respectively. The M1 metabolite of ABT-333 has antiviral activity, 
albeit 7-8 fold lower than the parent compound, and shows appreciable plasma exposures (30% to 60% of the 
parent drug). 
ABT-333 had a TD50 of 10,360 nM in an MTT cytotoxicity assay, producing a therapeutic index that exceeded 
1345-fold.

In vitro selection of drug resistance 
HCV subgenomic replicon cell lines were passaged in the presence of ABT-450, ABT-267 or ABT-333. The 
resistance variants selected in HCV genotype 1a-H77 or 1b-Con1 cell lines by these compounds were cloned into 
the respective subgenomic replicon, and the EC50 and EC90 values of ABT-450, ABT-267 or ABT-333 were 
evaluated. In addition, variants reported as being selected by other NS3/4A protease, NS5A or NS5B 
polymerase inhibitors were also analysed. 
Resistance selection in genotypes 1a and -1b 
The following major variants in HCV NS3 were observed in HCV subgenomic replicon cell lines treated with 
ABT-450: R155K, D168E, and D168N in 1a-H77; and R155Q, A156T, A156V, D168H and D168V in 1b-Con1. As 
is typical for a macrocyclic inhibitor of NS3/4A, ABT-450 selects for resistant variants at positions 155 and 168, 
which confer significant fold-changes in susceptibility (see below). This confirms that the virology of ABT-450 is 
relatively similar to that of simeprevir. 
Notably, the substitutions at positions 155 and 168 confer higher fold-changes 37-fold for R155K;13-219-fold 
for mutations in 168 position and likely significant resistance. The prevalent Q80K mutation in genotype 1a 
confers a fold-change of 3. For simeprevir, another macrocyclic inhibitor of NS3/4A, the fold-change for Q80K 
was less than 10; still this variant was associated with lower clinical efficacy, presumably due to an impaired 
barrier to further resistance. 
The following major variants in HCV NS5A were observed in HCV subgenomic replicon cell lines treated with 
ABT-267:  M28T, M28V, Q30R, Y93C, and Y93H in 1a-H77; and L28T, L31F, L31V and Y93H alone or in 
combination with L28M, R30Q or L31F/V in 1b-Con1. The selection of variants at positions 28, 30, 31 and 93, as 
well as the susceptibility changes seen indicate full cross resistance between ABT-267 and daclatasvir and 
ledipasvir. The high fold-changes for resistance associated mutations at 28, 30 and 93 in genotype 1a is a 
feature shared with daclatasvir and ledipasvir. Further, similar to these drugs, the barrier to resistance is higher 
in genotype 1b compared to 1a, with two mutations required to conceive very high fold-changes in -1b versus 
one in -1a. 
The following major variants in HCV NS5B were observed in HCV subgenomic replicon cell lines treated with 
ABT-333: C316Y, M414T, Y448H and S556G in both genotypes 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 replicons. Based on the 
fold-changes for single mutations (up to 5000-fold), ABT-333 is anticipated to be a drug with a low barrier to 
resistance in both genotype 1a and -1b. The lack of impact on susceptibility of the S282T mutation is notable, 
and indicative of the anticipated lack of cross resistance with nucleos(t)ide analogue inhibitors of NS5B. 
Resistance in HCV Genotype 4a Chimeric Replicons 
In a stable cell line replicon containing NS3 from HCV genotype 4a, variants at amino acid positions 155, 156 and 
168 were observed subsequent to passaging in the presence of ABT-450. In transient assays, A156T and R155C 
conferred 40-fold and 59-fold resistance to ABT-450, respectively, relative to the wild-type HCV genotype 4a 
chimeric replicon; while A156V, D168H, and D168V conferred 155 to 323-fold resistance to ABT-450. Thus, 
resistance to ABT-450 in genotype 4a occurs through mutations at similar positions as in genotype 1 
In a stable cell line replicon containing NS5A from HCV genotype 4a, L28V was the only variant selected 
subsequent to passaging in the presence of ABT-267. L28V conferred 30-fold resistance to ABT-267 relative to 
the wild-type HCV genotype 4a chimeric replicon in a transient assay. Like other NS5A inhibitor, the barrier to 
resistance of ABT-267 in genotype 4 may be more similar to genotype 1b than to -1a.

ABT-333 has no activity against genotype 4. 
Clinical drug resistance 
The main method used to detect resistant variants was population sequencing. No next-generation sequencing 
data has been presented; this, however, is no regulatory requirement. The regions encoding NS3 amino acids 1 
– 360, NS5A amino acids 1 – 215, and NS5B amino acids 300 – 591 were sequenced. 
The primary virologic failure (PVF) population consists of patients in the phase 2 and 3 program who were 
randomized to active therapy and who experienced on-treatment virological failure (failure to suppress, or 
on-treatment virological rebound) or who relapsed after end of therapy were included. As a control group, to 
assess the impact of baseline polymorphic variants on outcome, there were baseline samples sequenced from 
patients achieving SVR in the large phase IIb AVIATOR study (M11-652) as well as some other phase II studies. 
For the six phase 3 studies, samples were sequenced from baseline and time of failure for those who had 
rebound or relapse. In addition to that additional baseline samples were included from a subset of patients who 
achieved SVR (i.e. 2 SVR-achieving patients for every 1 PVF patient matched for HCV subtype, IL28B genotype, 
baseline HCV RNA, and sex to the extent possible). 
Resistance variants (RAVs) seen at baseline

The high frequency of NS3 Q80K is anticipated, particularly in US patients with genotype 1a. Baseline mutations 
at positions 155 and 168 are rare. The reported frequency of NS5A mutations at baseline is roughly similar to 
that seen in other DAA development programs (approx. 15%). Approximately 5% of samples showed baseline 
resistance relevant to ABT-333.

As anticipated, baseline NS3 resistance in genotype 1b is rare. The frequency of NS5A Y93H is similar to 
previous reports. Mutations impacting the susceptibility to ABT-333 are relatively common (>18%) 
BL RAVs and impact on outcome 
As the virological failure rate was very low in genotype 1b and genotype 4, the following discussion focuses on 
genotype 1a. 
No strong correlations between baseline resistant variants and outcomes were found, as shown in the following 
table. Please note that this table is an extract only including patients of the PVF population who were treated 
with the 3DAA regimen, +/- RBV. Also note that the table indicates the proportion of patients with a certain 
mutation among those failing virologically and those achieving SVR, respectively.

Notably, the Q80K mutation (very prevalent with GT1a-infection) was overrepresented in baseline samples from 
patients who did not achieve SVR in the population. However, response rates were still above 90% among

Note:  Observed data SVR24 rates exclude subjects who do not achieve SVR24 due to premature 
discontinuation of study drug or missing data in the SVR24 window as Q80K variants at baseline are unlikely to 
contribute to premature discontinuation from study drug or study. 
All in all, as most patients that failed virologically did not have RAVs at baseline conferring significant resistance 
to the DAAs, one may speculate further on the reasons for failure. For instance, one may wonder whether a more 
sensitive assay for detecting baseline RAVs might yield further prognostic information. This issue was raised 
during the approval procedure of another macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitor showing a similar resistance pattern as 
that of ABT-450, and therefore being essentially virologically similar. However, next generation sequencing with 
a sensitivity threshold of 1% (as opposed to approximately 20% for population sequencing), did not identify a 
substantial further proportion of patients with detectable resistant variants at baseline. Furthermore, for 
another NS5A inhibitor, there was no impact on outcome of resistant variants at baseline detectable by next 
generation sequencing at a population proportion of less than 20%. In summary, baseline resistance testing is 
not anticipated to be of utility for guiding the use of the present DAA combo. 
There were only 3 subjects with genotype 4 that experienced virological failure. Phylogenetic analysis indicated 
that all 3 were infected with subtype 4d. Prior to treatment, no variants were seen in samples from any of the 3 
subjects at resistance-associated positions relative to the reference sequence in NS3, whereas 1 subject had 
T58P and 1 had T58T/S present in NS5A at baseline. It is not known whether T58P or T58S in subtype 4d confers 
resistance to ABT-267. 
Resistance at time of failure 
The following table is a summary for resistance at time of failure, for patients with rebound or relapse in the 
phase 3 studies. The vast majority failing therapy had genotype 1a (those with genotype 1b are indicated in 
column 3).  
The table only includes RAVs that would be considered as primary (i.e. RAVs with more profound effects on 
susceptibility), to somewhat simplify. Therefore, when no RAVs are indicated, this may be either none detected,

or RAVs associated with a low FC (or where the FC has not been determined). Hence, the table somewhat 
underestimates treatment emergent resistant variants.

This table demonstrates that close to all patients fail with resistance to both the NS3A/4 and the NS5A class, and 
around half of the patients fail with a virus also resistant to dasabuvir. The lower frequency of dasabuvir 
resistance is likely due to a lower selective pressure due to lower potency; a similar phenomenon is seen if

comparing the risk of NS3/4A resistance on failure with telaprevir and boceprevir. The primary NS3/4A- and 
NS5A-RAVs that are seen confer cross resistance to other available agents of these classes. 
As stated above, 3 patients with genotype 4 experienced virological failure. 2 subjects had D168V and 1 subject 
had Y56H + D168V present in NS3. In NS5A at the time of virologic failure, 1 subject had L28V, 1 subject had 
L28S and M31M/I in addition to the T58P which had pre-existed at baseline, and 1 subject had L28V in addition 
to the T58S which was present at baseline. 
Persistence of selected resistant variants 
The persistence of emerged variants was evaluated in Phase 2 Studies M12-998, M13-386, M12-746, and 
M11-652. The table below shows RAVs associated with a larger FC (i.e. those shown in the preceding tables). 
Data is lacking for genotype 1b due to the low number of such treatment failures.

As can be seen, while the proportion of follow up sample with detectable NS3/4A mutations decline over 48 
weeks of post treatment follow-up, the proportion of samples with NS5A and NS5B resistance remains 
stationary. The findings of NS3/4A as well as NS5A are in accordance with previous reports after non-curative 
exposure to these classes. The persistence of selected resistance mutations to non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors 
has previously been less well characterised. 
All in all, these data illustrate the problem of what would be the appropriate retreatment regimen in those few 
patients that fail virologically on a combination of three drugs from different classes, all of which have a low 
barrier to resistance.

Thorough QT study 
Study M12-680 was a thorough QT study of the combination of ABT-450, ritonavir, ABT-267, and ABT-333 in 
healthy adults conducted to support the Phase 3 program. This placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 
400 mg) study evaluated therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of the DAAs, as shown below: 
• 
Therapeutic doses:  ABT-450 200 mg SDD + ritonavir 150 mg + ABT-267 25 mg + ABT-333 250 mg 
•  Supratherapeutic doses:  ABT-450 350 mg SDD + ritonavir 150 mg + ABT 267 50 mg + ABT-333 500 
mg 
Mean Cmax values with the supratherapeutic doses were 6.3-fold (ABT-450), 1.8-fold (ABT-267), and 2-fold 
(ABT-333) compared to Cmax values from the to-be-marketed formulation of ABT-450/r/ABT-267 150/100/25 
mg + ABT-333 250 mg. No subject in this study experienced QT interval corrected for heart rate using 
Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) interval values > 450 msec or changes from baseline > 30 msec when 
receiving a therapeutic or supratherapeutic dose of the 3-DAA combination. 
There is a minor QTc effect which is not considered clinically relevant. As discussed below, in the context of the 
dose ranging of ABT-333, this effect is likely due to that particular DAA.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  relative  contribution  of  CYP3A4  and  other  pathways  to  the  total elimination  of  ABT-450  at  steady  state 
remains uncertain due to the time-dependent effects of ritonavir. This means that the elimination pathways and 
metabolite pattern of ABT-450 may be different following a single dose of ABT-450/ritonavir compared with 
multiple doses. For example, M2 represented 3-8% of parent AUC after a single dose, but only 0.6% of parent 
AUC at steady state. Hence, it is unfortunate that the ADME study was performed as a single dose study. 
There are interaction studies that have been performed with the DAAs at steady state, but from these studies it 
is difficult to delineate the contribution of CYP-mediated metabolism and transporter-mediated hepatobiliary 
secretion, respectively.  
Hence,  CHMP  decided  to  request  that,  in  order  to  identify  potential  interactions  that  may  not  have  been 
sufficiently addressed by the Applicant, further in  vitro studies to characterise the enzyme(s) catalysing  the 
formation  of  the  main  metabolites  of  ABT-450  found  in  urine  and  faeces  are  to  be  submitted  as  a 
post-authorisation  measure.  It  is  important  that  the  design  of  such  studies  is  optimized  in  order  to  enable 
extrapolation to the in vivo steady state situation, where the metabolism of ABT-450 is affected by ritonavir. 
Recognising  that  this  is  a  challenging  task,  the  Applicant  should  submit  the  study  protocol  to  CHMP  for 
agreement as a first step. 
To understand the elimination of ABT-450 further, the formation of metabolite M29 (representing a large part of 
the  total  radioactive  dose  in  the  ADME  study)  needs  to  be  clarified.  It  is  agreed  that  data  indicate  that  the 
formation of M29 occurs within the intestinal lumen, but this should be confirmed by stability data of ABT-450 in 
human intestinal fluid  (eg., FaSSIF/FeSSIF) and faecal homogenates  as  a  post-authorisation  measure to  be 
submitted  by  the  Applicant  by  March  2015.  If  formation  of  M29  is  not  evident  from  such  studies,  further 
investigations may be warranted. 
Co-administration of ABT-450 with BSEP inhibitors could in theory lead to a higher frequency of transaminases 
elevations or hepatotoxicity (both ABT-450 and ritonavir may be inhibitors of BSEP). The applicant has 
evaluated the potential association between co-administration of a BSEP inhibitor (Phase 2/3 data) and 
frequency of post baseline serum ALT elevations. However, the analysis should have been performed with 
potential BSEP inhibitors defined using the cut-offs provided in the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Drug 
Interactions and the Applicant is requested to analyse the clinical safety data with respect to concomitant use of 
drugs that may inhibit BSEP based on the EU guideline criteria (50*Cmax,u/Ki≥1) and submit this analysis as a 
post-authorisation measure by March 2015. 
Discussion on pharmacodynamics 
ABT-450 shows protein binding adjusted EC50 values in replicon assays for genotypes 1a, -1b and 4 in the low 
nanomolar range. Similar to other macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitors, it selects for resistance at positions 155 and 
168  in  the  protease.  ABT-450  has  a  low  to  moderate  barrier  to  resistance;  in  case  of  virological  failure, 
treatment emergent resistant variants are seen in most patients. 
Similar to NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, ABT-267 shows picomolar EC50s across genotypes. As typical of its class, 
this drug has a low barrier to resistance and selects for resistant variants at NS5A positions 28, 30 and 93. 
ABT-333  is  the  first  non-nucleoside  inhibitor  of  the  viral  NS5B  polymerase  to  undergo  European  regulatory 
evaluation. It has nanomolar EC50s against genotype 1, but is likely not effective against other genotypes. It 
has a low barrier to resistance. The primary NS5B variant selected on failure is S556G. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 86/150 
  
  
A  combination  through  QTc  study  including  supratherapeutic  doses  of  each  DAA  did  not  show  any  clinically 
relevant impact on the QTc interval. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has provided an extensive number of in vitro and in vivo studies, and the basic pharmacokinetic 
characteristics  of  ABT-450,  ritonavir,  ombitasvir  and  dasabuvir  have  been  sufficiently  well  described.  Three 
post-approval measures are suggested in order to improve the understanding of the elimination of ABT-450 and 
further  investigate  potential  mechanism  for  the  transaminases  elevations,  and  the  SmPC  needs  further 
amendments to adequately describe the interaction potential. 
Multiple class resistance in patients failing therapy with this regimen may have important consequences on any 
further treatment attempts. This is a major risk associated with the use of this 3DAA combination, which should 
be  followed  prospectively  as  specified  in  the  RMP.  The  clinical  consequence  of  treatment  failure  is  a  most 
important issue to integrate to the discussion of optimal regimens and treatment durations, in particular for 
patients with cirrhosis (the discussed further in the efficacy section).

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The dose selection of regimen components 
Formulation issues 
As a preamble, it is noted that the formulations used in earlier trials and in phase III were not fully bioequivalent. 
The  following  introduction  serves  to  clarify  this  background  to  the  dose  selection  process.  The  doses  and 
formulations of the DAAs used for all Phase 3 studies are presented in the table below. 
The formulations of the 3 DAAs used in Phase 2 studies were different than those used in Phase 3 studies. The 
doses and formulations of the DAAs used for the Phase 2 studies are presented in Table 68. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 87/150 
 
  
  
ABT-450 exposure was about 60% higher with the phase III formulation compared to that used in phase II. Note 
that ABT-450 kinetics are non-linear with a non-proportional increase in exposure with increased dose.  
ABT-267, ABT-333 and ritonavir exposures from the Phase 3 formulations were comparable to the formulations 
used in Phase 2 studies. However, the dose of ABT-333 in the phase 3 formulation was lower, as bioavailability 
of ABT-333 was higher compared to the phase 2 formulation. ABT-333 exposures from the ABT-333 250 mg 
tablet formulation used in the Phase 3 studies were bioequivalent to the ABT-333 400 mg tablets used in the 
Phases 2 studies. It is furthermore notable that the phase 2 formulation of ABT-333 differed from that used in 
the monotherapy study (see below). 
The dose selection for ABT-450 
M11-602 was a dose-ranging study for ABT-450/r was conducted using monotherapy and combination therapy 
with pegIFN and RBV in HCV genotype 1-infected treatment-naïve subjects. 
While  3-day  monotherapy  with  ABT-450/r  doses  of  50/100  mg  to  200/100  mg  with  the  capsule  (HGC) 
formulation showed similar ~4.0 log10 viral load decline, a possible dose-response relationship was observed 
for virologic failure rates when these doses were administered for 12 weeks in combination with pegIFN and RBV 
followed by administration of pegIFN and RBV for a total duration of up to 48 weeks.  
In treatment-naïve, GT1-infected subjects, ABT-450 doses ≥ 100 mg using the capsule formulation combined 
with pegIFN and RBV, showed a lower virologic failure rate compared to a lower ABT-450 dose of 50 mg – 0/15 
(0%) subjects with virologic failure at ABT-450/r 100/100 mg and 200/100 mg compared to 3/8 (37.5%) at 
ABT-450/r 50/100 mg. 
Resistant variants selected with ABT-450/r suggested a potential advantage of the higher ABT-450 doses as 
shown in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 88/150 
 
  
  
Thus, in monotherapy, all tested doses yielded an approximate 4 log10 decline in plasma HCV-RNA. The antiviral 
potency of this NS3/4A inhibitor is similar to that seen, e.g., for telaprevir and simeprevir. This effect in a short 
term monotherapy study is exerted on the dominant viral population. The applicant points to indications that 
within the tested dose range, activity against the common R155K escape variant, conferring a 37-fold shift in 
EC50,  was  higher  with  higher  doses  within  the  tested  interval.  The  notion  that  the  selected  dose,  and 
subsequent exposure, should, if possible, also impact emerging resistant variants, is central to antiviral drug 
dose selection. This is anticipated to increase the barrier to resistance. The applicant applied principles entirely 
in line with the prevailing drug development paradigm. 
While higher doses of ABT-450 provided better suppression of resistant variants in Phase 2 studies, higher doses 
have also been associated with a higher incidence of ALT elevations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 89/150 
 
 
 
 
  
  
For a further discussion of ABT-450-associated transaminitis and hepatic safety, see section on clinical safety. 
A comparison of grade 3+ ALT elevations following DAA combination therapy and R155K selection following 
monotherapy and DAA combination therapy across different ABT-450/r doses from Phase 2 studies is shown 
below. 
Thus, the selected dose of ABT-450 is a compromise to confer further benefit in providing antiviral efficacy, and 
therefore a greater barrier to resistance, given the certainly pre-existing resistant variants on the one hand, and 
the need to limit the incidence of transaminitis, which is an exposure dependent effect of ABT-450, on the other. 
The dose selection of ABT-267 
ABT-267 has been administered as monotherapy (Studies M12-116 and M13-386) at doses ranging from 1.5 mg 
QD  to  200  mg  QD  for  2  to  3  days.  The  maximum  change  in  viral  load  decline  following  monotherapy  with 
ABT-267 doses in the range of 1.5 mg QD to 200 mg QD is shown below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 90/150 
 
 
 
 
  
  
ABT-267 at 5 mg QD (N = 9), 50 mg QD (N = 9) and 200 mg QD (N = 10) has also been administered for 12 
weeks in combination with pegIFN/RBV, followed by administration of pegIFN/RBV for an additional 36 weeks in 
Study M12-114. Virologic failure rates were comparable across ABT-267 5 mg, 50 mg, and 200 mg doses. Two 
subjects  in  the  5  mg  dose  group  who  completed  assigned  treatment  relapsed;  2  subjects  and  1  subject 
rebounded in 50 mg and 200 mg dose groups, respectively. 
Based  on  the  protein-adjusted  EC50  value  in  replicon  and  Ctrough  concentration  in  HCV-infected  subjects, 
ABT-267 doses ≥ 25 mg QD have the potential to suppress the GT 1a M28V variant which confers approximately 
60-fold loss in susceptibility to ABT-267 compared to wild type. Other single mutants such as Y93H confer much 
higher fold-changes and could not reasonably be covered with a higher dose. 
In Study M12-114, ABT-267 doses of 5 mg QD, 50 mg QD, and 200 mg QD for a duration of 12 weeks were 
well-tolerated  by  HCV-infected  subjects  in  combination  with  pegIFN  and  RBV,  with  adverse  events  and 
laboratory abnormalities comparable to pegIFN/RBV alone. 
ABT-267, when dosed with ABT-450/r, has been shown to decrease ABT-450 exposures. The effect of ABT-267 
on ABT-450 exposures is shown in Figure 18. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 91/150 
 
  
  
This suggests that increasing ABT-267 dose could have a detrimental effect on ABT-450 exposures. As ABT-450 
is the most potent of the relevant DAAs, the increase in ABT-267 exposure at the expense of ABT-450 exposures 
is undesirable. 
Based on these data, the ABT-267 25 mg QD dose was selected for Phase 3 studies.  
The dose selection of ritonavir 
The ritonavir dose selected for coadministration with ABT-450 is 100 mg. This is based on the pharmacokinetics 
of ABT-450 at different ritonavir doses and historic data with ritonavir 100 mg in HIV-1-infected subjects.  
The dose selection of ribavirin 
The daily dose of RBV used in Phase 3 studies was 1,000 or 1,200 mg, divided BID, and based on subject weight. 
This dose is approved for treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV infection in combination with pegIFN by 
itself and pegIFN with telaprevir or boceprevir and others. The selection of the dose of 1000/1200 mg ribavirin 
when used in interferon-free DAA combinations has become standard. This dose has previously been shown to 
have a generally acceptable safety profile and to provide the possibility of dose reduction in case of significant 
anaemia without any loss of efficacy. 
The selection of treatment regimens for the phase 3 studies 
The main study to inform regimen selection for phase III was M11-652, also termed AVIATOR. 
This was a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, combination treatment study of multiple doses of ABT-450/r, and 
ABT-267  and/or  ABT-333  with  or  without  RBV  in  non-cirrhotic  HCV  genotype  1-infected  treatment-naïve 
subjects and previous null responders to pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and RBV treatment. 
The study consisted of a  Treatment Period of 8, 12, or 24 weeks and a  Follow-up Period for sustained viral 
response and resistance monitoring for 48 weeks.

For each arm, dosing was as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 93/150 
 
  
  
Ribavirin was dosed at 1000/1200 mg per day depending on body weight below or above 75 kg. 
Subjects were HCV-infected, non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve or prior null responders to pegIFN+RBV. Patients 
with HBV or HIV coinfection were excluded. For a definition of null response, see below under the heading “main 
efficacy studies”. The selection of previous null responders provides an enrichment of patients known to be on 
the  difficult  to  cure  end  of  the  scale;  thus,  the  population  is  presumed  to  bracket  the  range  of  innate  host 
responses to support direct acting antiviral effects. 
In terms of defining the appropriate regimen the study contains comparisons of  
•  Duration: 8 versus 12 versus 24 weeks of therapy. 
•  ABT-450 doses: 100 versus 150 versus 200 mg of ABT-450 used for 12 weeks, and 100 versus 150 mg 
of ABT-450 used for 24 weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 94/150 
 
 
  
  
•  Combinations  of  drugs:  ABT-450+ABT-333+RBV  versus  ABT-450+ABT-267+RBV  versus 
ABT-450+ABT-267+ABT-333 versus ABT-450 +ABT-267 + ABT-333+RBV when used for 12 weeks.  
Thus,  the  AVIATOR  study  forms  quite  a  complex  investigation  of  different  regimen  possibilities.  In  terms  of 
regimens not studied, it is notable that there are no 2DAA regimens without RBV. Thus, there is no way within 
this study of directly assessing the impact of the third agent on overall regimen efficacy. 
Overall, SVR24 was achieved in 89.7% of treatment-naïve subjects and 92.5% of prior null responders overall. 
The further analysis of this study, however, is conducted along the lines of its informing on adequate regimens 
in genotypes 1a and -1b respectively.

While the response rates are generally impressive, the lower efficacy in genotype 1a compared to -1b is notable. 
This is due to a lower potency and/or barrier to resistance for all the three DAAs against genotype 1a. 
Conclusions regarding treatment duration 
Comparison  of  relapse  rates  between  arms  is  particularly  relevant  when  assessing  the  impact  of  treatment 
duration.  Among  treatment-naïve  subjects  receiving  3  DAAs  +  RBV,  10/80  relapsed  following  8  weeks  of 
treatment in Group A, compared with 1/79 following 12 weeks of treatment in Groups [F + G] and 3/78 following 
24 weeks of treatment in Groups [H + I], 2 of which discontinued treatment prematurely. The difference in 
response  rates  between  8  and  12  weeks'  duration  was  driven  primarily  by  the  subjects  with  genotype  1a 
infection, as there was only 1 virologic failure in Group A and  none in Groups  [F + G] among subjects with 
genotype 1b infection. There were no relapses among null responders treated with 3 DAAs+RBV for 12  [K + L] 
or 24 [M + N] weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 95/150 
 
 
 
  
  
Based on the higher relapse rate with 8 weeks duration, and the lack of a difference between 12 and 24 weeks, 
12 weeks was chosen as the standard duration in the phase III studies. 24 weeks of therapy was also studied in 
the TURQUOISE-II trial, dedicated to compensated cirrhotics. Such patients are now known to require a longer 
treatment duration on average than do non-cirrhotics. Furthermore, there were no cirrhotics in the AVIATOR 
study. 
Conclusions regarding the dose of ABT-450 
No significant differences were seen in SVR12 rates among subjects treated with the same regimen, but with 
different  ABT-450/r  doses  (100/100  mg  versus  150/100  mg  or  100/100  mg  versus  200/100  mg).  Overall 
efficacy was therefore not a driver of ABT-450/r dose selection for Phase 3. Instead, selection of the ABT-450/r 
dose was based on resistance and safety analyses. These concerns are described above, under the heading on 
dose selection. 
Conclusions regarding the contribution of ABT-267 to regimen efficacy 
The comparison of the SVR24 rate in Group B (no ABT-267) and groups treated with 3 DAAs + RBV for 12 weeks 
was used to assess the contribution of ABT-267 to the treatment response. When Group B was compared with 
Group G (same ABT-450/r dose), the difference of 11.64% was not statistically significant (P = 0.141). When 
Group  B  was  compared  with  Groups  [F  +  G],  the  difference  of  13.15%  showed  a  trend  toward  statistical 
significance (P = 0.056). The difference in response rates was driven by the subjects with genotype 1a infection, 
as there were no virologic failures in these groups among subjects with genotype 1b infection. 
Conclusions regarding the contribution of ABT-333 to regimen efficacy 
Comparison of the SVR24 rate in groups that did not receive ABT-333 and groups treated with 3 DAAs + RBV for 
12  weeks  was  used  to  assess  the  contribution  of  ABT-333  to  the  treatment  response.  When  Group  C  was 
compared with Group F (treatment-naïve, same ABT-450/r dose), the difference of 13.31% showed a trend 
toward statistical significance (P = 0.090), which persisted when Groups [C + D] were compared with Groups [F 
+ G] (P = 0.090) and when Groups [C + D + J] were compared with Groups [F + G + K + L] (P = 0.065). Once 
again, the difference in responses was driven by genotype 1a –infected subjects, as there were no failures in 
these groups among genotype 1b-infected subjects. 
Conclusions regarding the contribution of ribavirin to regimen efficacy 
The comparison of the SVR24 rate in Group E (no RBV) and groups treated with 3 DAAs + RBV for 12 weeks was 
used to assess the contribution of RBV to the treatment response. When Group E was compared with Group G 
(same ABT-450/r dose), the difference of 6.88% was not statistically significant (P = 0.262). When Group E was 
compared with Groups [F + G], the difference of 8.03% showed a trend toward statistical significance (P = 
0.089). Again, the difference in response rates was driven by the subjects with genotype 1a infection, as there 
were no virologic failures in these groups among subjects with genotype 1b infection. 
Comments on the selection of the combination regimen 
ABT-450 is the most potent antiviral agent in the combination, but cannot be used as monotherapy due to its 
insufficient barrier to resistance. 
In a very small sample in study M12-998, the SVR  rate with ABT-450(r)+ABT267 given without ribavirin to 
patients with genotype 1a virus was 5/8 (62.5%). Data from the AVIATOR study indicate the contribution of 
each of the 3DAAs to regimen efficacy against genotype 1a.

EMA/768346/2014 
Page 96/150 
  
  
Concerning genotype 1b, the dual DAA combo of ABT-450(r) + ABT-267 is being studied in the ongoing PEARL-1 
(M13-393) study, as well as in the M12-539 study. The virological failure rate seen when only ABT-450(r) + 
ABT267  was  given  to  treatment  experienced  patients  with  genotype  1b  infection,  under  two  different  study 
protocols, is reported at 6.6% (5/76)

In  the  PEARL-1  study,  there  were  no  virological  failures  with  this  combination  among  42  treatment  naïve, 
non-cirrhotic patients. Despite the latter, these outcomes would further support an incremental effect of a third 
agent  also  in  an  unselected  treatment  naïve  population  with  genotype  1b,  as  a  wide  such  group  would  be 
anticipated to contain such patients as in a peginterferon+ribavirin cohort, the only difference being that these 
have not been exposed to these drugs (about half of a treatment naïve genotype 1 cohort would not be cured if 
treated with peginterferon+ribavirin only, and 10-20% would be “null responders”). 
The preliminary data on the efficacy of the dual combination in genotype 1b receive external support from an 
analogous  drug  development  program,  indicating  that  the  efficacy  of  this  combination  would  likely  be 
considerable, though not optimised.  
A  similar  argument  goes  for  the  combination  of  ABT-450+ABT-333,  though  due  to  the  lower  potency  of 
ABT-333, the efficacy of this combination would likely be lower than for the ABT-450+ABT-267 combination. 
Based on such considerations, as well as the apparent tolerability of the regimen, the company proceeded to 
study only the triple DAA combination in phase III. The value of the addition of ribavirin was studied in three 
trials including non-cirrhotic patients. The choice of comparing 3DAA versus 3DAA + RBV, rather than, e.g., 
ABT-450 + ABT267+ RBV versus 3DAA+RBV was informed by safety data indicating a favourable safety profile 
of  ABT-333  compared  to  RBV  (see  discussion  of  clinical  safety).  It  is  notable,  however,  that  among  the 
non-cirrhotic patients with genotype 1b infection in the AVIATOR study, 46/46 patients treated with 2DAA+RBV 
achieved SVR, indicating that this is a highly effective regimen in genotype 1b, as it has been shown to be in 
genotype 4 (see below).  
In the phase III trial (TURQOUISE-II) dedicated to compensated cirrhotics, all patients received RBV, and a 
comparison was made between 12 and 24 weeks of therapy.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
The applicant has performed six phase III studies in patients with genotype 1a and -1b virus. Five of these were 
in non-cirrhotic patients, whereas one was dedicated to patients with compensated cirrhosis. Furthermore, the 
applicant has submitted four supportive studies performed in post-transplant patients with genotype 1 virus that 
do  not  have  advanced  fibrosis,  in  genotype  4  patients  in  patients  with  genotype  1  virus  that  are  on  opiate 
substitution, and in patients with genotype 1 infection that have HIV coinfection.

In this table, 3-DAA refers to ABT-450/r/ABT-267 (150/100/25 mg QD) + ABT-333 (250 mg BID). In all studies, 
ribavirin was dosed at 1000/1200 mg per day with body weight below or above 75 kg. 
2.5.2.1.  General design features for the phase 3 studies 
There are two studies where 12 weeks of 3DAA+RBV therapy is compared to placebo (SAPPHIRE I and –II). As 
the anticipated SVR rate in the placebo group is 0, the purpose of this comparison is exclusively the evaluation 
of safety. 
There are three studies where 12 weeks of 3DAA+RBV is compared to 12 weeks of 3DAAs (PEARL-II, PEARL-III, 
PEARL-IV) 
The  above  studies  included  non-cirrhotic  patients  with  genotype  1a  or  -1b infection.  Requirements  for  prior 
treatment  history  varied  (see  below).  Patients  with  prior  exposure  to other  direct  acting  antivirals  were  not 
studied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 98/150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
There is one study where 12 weeks and 24 weeks of 3DAA+RBV are compared in patients with compensated 
cirrhosis (TURQUOISE-II). These patients could have genotype 1a or -1b virus, and could either be treatment 
naïve or having previously failed on pegIFN+RBV therapy. 
The following stratification factors were used in the studies:  
•  HCV genotype (1a vs. 1b) when applicable 
• 
• 
IL-28 genotype (CC vs. non-CC) for the treatment naïve groups. 
Type of prior response (null – or partial responders, or relapse), and referring to prior therapy with 
peg-IFN + RBV.  
The definitions of prior response to peginterferon+ribavirin where those generally accepted and in accordance 
with the existing regulatory guidance: 
•  Null responder: failed to achieve a 2 log10 reduction in HCV RNA (IU/mL) at Week 12; or > 1 log10 
reduction at Week 4 (≥ 25 days). 
• 
Partial responder: achieved ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA at Week 12, but still had detectable 
HCV-RNA at end of treatment (minimum 20 weeks). 
•  Relapser: undetectable at or after the end of at least 36 weeks of treatment, but relapsed within 52 
weeks of treatment follow-up. 
Main inclusion/exclusion criteria 
The major inclusion/exclusion criteria are implied in each of the study titles. These pertain to the subgenotype 
of the virus and to the patient being treatment naïve or having previously been treated with peginterferon+RBV. 
Furthermore cirrhosis was either an exclusion criterion or an inclusion criterion for each of the pivotal studies. 
These are the definitions used to determine cirrhosis as an inclusion criterion (study M13-099), or to exclude 
cirrhosis (the other five pivotal trials).

methods could be used to rule out cirrhosis (in accordance with local practice). With regards to Fibroscan results,

a kPA of <9.6 kPa would in fact also rule out many patients with METAVIR F3, creating an enrichment of patients 
with mild or moderate fibrosis in the non-cirrhosis studies. 
Apart from cirrhosis (above), the same main exclusion criteria applied in all studies, namely: 
• 
Previous  use  of  any  investigational  or  commercially  available  anti-HCV  therapy  (excepting 
peginterferon+RBV in those studies targeting “treatment experienced” patients. 
(other than interferon and/or pegIFN/RBV) 
• 
•  HIV- and HBV co-infection 
•  A large number of other medications (listed in tables below). Strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers were 
also disallowed within 2 weeks prior to the study 
•  Use of any herbal supplements 
•  Cause of liver disease other than HCV infection 
•  Recent (within 6 months) history of drug or alcohol abuse 
For  the  studies  in  non-cirrhotics,  screening  laboratory  analyses  showing  any  of  the  following  abnormal 
laboratory results: 
indirect bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN and direct bilirubin > ULN 
INR > 1.5

For the TURQUOISE II study (M13-099) in patients with compensated cirrhosis, the following laboratory limits 
were used 
INR > 2.3 
albumin < 2.8 g/dL; 
Total bilirubin > 3 mg/dL

Furthermore, patients could not have a present or past Child-Pugh B/C classification, or have a history of hepatic 
decompensation, including variceal bleeding events. 
Due to the potential for DDIs of this ritonavir-boosted triple DAA regimen, a considerable number of medications 
were prohibited.

*Two patients were lost to follow-up, 1 patient discontinued due to "other" reasons 
Virological rebound occurred from week 2 to week 8 of treatment, and all relapses were seen within 4 weeks of 
stopping therapy in this study. 
It  is  clear  that  in  patients  with  genotype  1a  virus,  also  in  the  absence  of  advanced  liver  disease,  the  3DAA 
regimen  without  ribavirin  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  both  of  on-treatment  virological  breakthrough 
(rebound)  and  of  post-treatment  relapse.  Thus  the  3DAA  regimen  is  in  fact  not  optimized  in  an  unselected 
population with genotype 1a. The apparent impact of IL28B genotype on the likelihood of SVR, particularly in the 
RBV-free arm, is noted. Regarding baseline resistance in this study, while the Q80K mutation, which does not 
confer  high  level  resistance  to  ABT-450,  was  apparently  more  common  in  those  failing  virologically  in  the 
ribavirin-free arm, the impact of detectable high level baseline resistance does not explain the increased failure 
rates (see above section on pharmacodynamics).

The efficacy of the 3DAA without ribavirin regimen was outstanding in genotype 1b. There was no room for 
additive efficacy with RBV. 
2.5.2.2.2.  Treatment experienced (TE) patients without cirrhosis   (GT-1) 
It has been noted above that patients with prior experience of direct acting antiviral therapy were not included 
in  the  TE  studies;  thus  TE  exclusively  refers  to  experience  of  peginterferon+ribavirin.  As  exposure  to  this 
regimen does not select for resistance, and thus does not alter the activity of drugs in a subsequent regimen, 
such a TE population is understood as an enrichment of that more difficult to treat subgroup of a treatment naïve 
population,  who  would  not  have  been  cured  on  peginterferon+ribavirin  therapy  alone.  In  typical  trials  of 
genotype  1  infected,  treatment  naïve  subjects  with  pegIFN/RBV,  SVR  rates  have  been  approximately  50%. 
Approximately 10-15% relapsed after the end of treatment; 10-15% are partial responders and approximately 
20% are null responders.

Patients were randomized to 3 DAAs + RBV or placebo (3:1) for 12 weeks. Patients allocated to placebo were 
offered the active regimen for 12 weeks open label after the blinded period. As stated above, in the discussion 
of  SAPPHIRE-I,  the  anticipated  SVR  rate  in  the  placebo  group  is  0.  Therefore  the  placebo  comparison  is  of 
relevance for safety only.

Of the 7 who relapsed, 6 were male, 6 had the IL28B non-CC genotype, and 3 had F3 fibrosis stage. 
When using the 3DAA+RBV, efficacy is very high also in these patients that are enriched “poor responders” to 
pegIFN+RBV, with virtually similar outcomes regardless of prior response category or viral subgenotype (though 
the  proportion  of  relapsers  was  numerically  higher  in  genotype  1a.  Further,  it  is  notable  that  also  in  such 
previously  defined  poor  responders  to  pegIFN+RBV,  the  addition  of  RBV  to  3DAA  prevents  on  treatment 
virological breakthrough in patients with genotype 1a virus.

2.5.2.2.3.  Patients with genotype 1a or 1b virus and compensated cirrhosis 
Study M13-099 (TURQUOISE-II) 
Title of the study: 
A  randomized,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  ABT-450/Ritonavir/ABT-267 
(ABT-450/r/ABT-267)  and  ABT-333  coadministered  with  ribavirin  (RBV)  in  adults  with  genotype  1  chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis (TURQUOISE-II) 
This  study  is  remarkable  insofar  as  it  is  the  first  registrational  study  in  the  field  of  HCV  therapy  dedicated 
exclusively to patients with (compensated) cirrhosis. Thus it counterbalances the fact that most patients in the 
other phase III studies had minimal fibrosis. 
The study was conducted at 78 investigative sites in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Belgium, France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom 
In contrast to the other phase III studies, this study was providing the treatments open label: 
Patients were randomized to 3DAAs + RBV for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks.  
Notably, this study included patients with either -1a or -1b viral subgenotype; also, it included both patients that 
were treatment naïve as well as patients with prior experience of non-curative peginterferon + RBV therapy. 
It is presently well known that the mean requirements in terms of drug pressure and/or treatment duration, in 
order to maximize SVR rates, is higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to those that have less advanced liver 
disease. Furthermore, the phase II program did not include patients with cirrhosis. Finally, failure to achieve 
SVR with the 3DAA is likely to be associated with multiple class drug resistance. As compensated cirrhotics may 
progress to decompensation if SVR is not reached, and as it is presently unclear how to retreat patients with 
cirrhosis that have preselected for triple class drug resistance, the prudent strategy of adding ribavirin to the 
regimen  of  all  patients  is  recognized,  even  though  it  leaves  the  question  open  of  whether  cirrhotics  with 
genotype 1b infection might do without it. Furthermore, the need to explore the appropriate treatment duration 
in cirrhotics in phase III is recognized.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria and stratification factors are delineated at the beginning of this section on the pivotal 
studies of this application. As a reminder, patients could only be included if they had a prior liver biopsy showing 
cirrhosis, or a Fibroscan result (within 6 months) of 14.6 kPa, minimum baseline platelets was 60,000. Further, 
patients had to have a Child-Pugh A classification and no history of clinical decompensation. 
Overall,  SVR  rates  were  91.8%  (191/208)  and  95.9%  (165/172)  in  the  12  and  24  weeks  treatment  arm, 
respectively. SVR rates were very high for either treatment duration for patients infected with genotype 1b - 
only 1/119 did not achieve SVR12. This patient, TE with prior partial response, had a relapse after completing 12 
weeks of therapy. For patients with genotype 1a-infection, 24 weeks of therapy yielded an SVR rate of >90% in 
all subgroups, while 12 weeks of therapy carried higher risk of failure in some subsets.

Thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis is a marker of portal hypertension. Baseline platelet count is one of the main 
predictors of disease progression in cirrhosis. Low counts are generally associated with more severe disease, 
where extended treatment durations may be of importance. This is both in terms of required drug pressure to 
achieve SVR, as well as in terms of the potential clinical consequences of failing to achieve SVR. The number of 
patients with low platelets was relatively small in this study (a consequence of selection criteria, as the likelihood 
of  meeting  other  exclusion  criteria  related  to  Child-Pugh  status  and  clinical  decompensation  increases  with 
decreasing platelet counts). 
SVR12 rates by baseline platelet counts were presented as below.

Rebound  (n=4)  only  occurred  in  patients  with  genotype  1a-infection  (1  in  arm  A,  3  in  arm  B).  The  risk  for 
rebound  is  not  affected  by  the  treatment  duration.  The  relapse  frequency,  however,  may  be  lowered  by 
increasing the treatment duration.  
For genotype 1a there is therefore an interest in scrutinizing the risk for relapse for the two different treatment 
durations by type of patient population. In the full dataset, the relapse rate among patients with GT1a in the 12 
week arm was 11/140 (8%) versus 1/121 (1%) in the 24 week arm. Counting the patient in the 24 week arm 
with  on-treatment  breakthrough  at  day  97  as  a  “relapse”  (as  this  breakthrough  occurred  after  12  weeks  of 
therapy), the point estimate would be 2/121 (1.5%)..

In an attempt to further understand the determinants of relapse after 12 weeks, in order to identify those 
cirrhotic GT1a patients most suitable for 12 or 24 weeks of therapy, the applicant further analysed this dataset 
by logistic regression. Some traditional prognostic factors, such as age and baseline HCV RNA, were unrelated 
to relapse. Former injection drug use identified 10 of the 11 relapsers, but the biological plausibility of this 
marker is uncertain. IL28b genotype was also associated with relapse, but only when comparing TT genotype 
with non-TT genotype.  Male sex was marginally associated with relapse. 
Higher AFP, lower platelets, and lower albumin, all factors identifying patients with more advanced cirrhosis, 
were each significantly associated with relapse. These variables collectively identified all of the prior null 
responders who relapsed and 3 of the 4 treatment-naïve subjects who relapsed.

While it is recognized that Gt1a cirrhotics with a higher risk of relapse on 12 weeks of therapy could be identified 
post hoc using various biologically plausible baseline characteristics, and particularly that data indicate that 
cirrhosis associated with low platelets or biochemical abnormalities is a risk factor for relapse with a shorter 
treatment durations, the actual cut-offs presented above are considered clinically arbitrary.

2.5.2.3.  Efficacy in genotype 4 
Study M13-393 (PEARL-1) 
Title of the study: 
A  randomized,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  co-administration  of  ABT-450  with 
ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 in adults with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (PEARL-I) 
This study comprises different study arms where patients have either genotype 4 or genotype 1b virus. In the 
present context, the focus is on genotype 4, and genotype 1b data are only discussed insofar as they are used 
for bridging assumptions. . 
ABT-450 + ombitasvir (2DAA) was administered for 12 weeks, with or without RBV, in adult HCV genotype 4-, 
non-cirrhotic  treatment-naïve  subjects.  This  2-DAA  regimen  was  also  administered  with  RBV  in  adult  HCV 
genotype 4-infected, non-cirrhotic pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced subjects. As previously stated, based on 
in vitro findings, ABT-333 in not anticipated to show any activity against genotype 4. In arms 7 and 8 (see 
below)  2-DAA  alone  were  given  for  24  weeks  to  treatment  naïve  and  pegIFN/RBV  treatment  experienced 
patients with GT1b infection and compensated cirrhosis.

The study mainly comprised patients with viral subtypes 4a and 4d, which is typical of a European genotype 4 
population.  Among  1b  cirrhotics,  approximately  40%  had  platelets  below  120  and  87%  had  IL28  non-CC 
genotype

Thus  the  efficacy  of  2  DAA+RBV  was  excellent,  as  would  have  been  anticipated  given  that  there  may  be 
similarities in response between genotype 4 and genotype 1b based on virological considerations. Notably, there 
were a few virological failures when RBV was excluded. 
While there are presently no data available on the treatment of patients with genotype 4 and cirrhosis, it is 
notable that the in vitro EC50 for GT1b and GT4 is similar for both paritaprevir and ombitasvir. Furthermore, the 
barrier  to  resistance  may  be  roughly  similar  for  both  drugs  and  (sub)genotypes  (see  pharmacodynamics 
section). As 2DAA were highly effective when given for 24 weeks to GT1b cirrhotics, it appears that an inference 
of likely similar efficacy of 2DAA+RBV if given for 24 weeks to GT4 cirrhotics can be made.  
2.5.2.4.  Efficacy in the post-transplant setting 
Study M12-999 
This  was  an  open-label  study 
to  evaluate 
the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
the  combination  of 
ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267  (ABT-450/r/ABT-267)  and  ABT-333  with  or  without  ribavirin  (RBV)  in  adult  liver 
transplant recipients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 
The applicant has submitted data from a Cohort 1 (=arm A) of this ongoing study, which is fully enrolled and 
comprises 34 HCV genotype 1-infected subjects with fibrosis ≤ F2 (Metavir). Subjects were treatment-naïve 
after transplantation but may have received previous HCV treatment (pegIFN or IFN with or without RBV) prior 
to liver transplantation. 
Patients received 3DAA + RBV for 24 weeks.  
RBV dosing was managed at the discretion of the investigator. Previous studies in this population highlight the 
potential  for  RBV  dose  modification,  use  of  erythropoiesis-stimulating  agents,  such  as  erythropoietin,  and 
transfusion.  Creatinine  clearance  is  commonly  reduced  in  this  population,  in  part  due  to  chronic  calcineurin

inhibitor  (CNI)  exposure.  The  reduced  creatinine  clearance  may  augment  RBV  exposures,  increasing  the 
possible risk of RBV toxicity. Consequently, RBV dosing was at the discretion of the investigator and typical 
weight-based dosing was not required upon initiation of study drug. 
The most frequently selected RBV dose range at the initiation of therapy was 600 – 800 mg per day (19/34 
subjects;  55.9%).  This  was  also  the  most  common  RBV  dose  at  completion  of  the  study  regimen  (23/34 
subjects; 67.6%). Overall, 19 (55.9%) subjects dose modified RBV. 
The use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), cyclosporine and tacrolimus, at a stable dose was permitted with the 
following  recommendations  for  dose  adjustment  based  on  data  from  Phase  1  drug-interaction  studies: 
Tacrolimus:  500  mg  once  a  week  taken  with  the  study  drugs  and  with  food.  Cyclosporine:  one-fifth  of  the 
pre-study total daily dose taken as a single daily dose with the study drugs and with food. Adjustment of CNI 
dose and dosing interval was permitted based on the investigator's interpretation of CNI levels.

Thus  this  is  a  not  very  advanced  post-transplant  cohort  without  significant  fibrosis,  and  with  a  high  mean

advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis were included. 
Of the 32 subjects with data available to assess SVR12, 31 (96.9%) achieved SVR12; being 96.3% (26/27) in 
subjects with genotype 1a infection and 100% (5/5) in subjects with genotype 1b infection.  
A single subject with HCV genotype 1a infection, experienced relapse at Post-Treatment Day 3.

2.5.2.5.  Efficacy in patients receiving opiate substitution therapy 
Study M14-103 
This  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  phase  2  study  to  evaluate  the  combination  of  ABT-450/r/ABT-267  and 
ABT-333 co-administered with ribavirin (RBV) in adults with genotype 1 hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection taking 
methadone or buprenorphine. 
From a regulatory perspective, patients with HCV infection taking opiate substitution therapy are not considered 
a clinically relevant subgroup for which there is a need of a specific demonstration of efficacy and safety, in the 
absence  of  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  that  would  mandate  specific  studies,  e.g.,  of  the 
appropriateness of proposed dose adjustments. In this case, estimates by cross study comparisons indicate that 
methadone  may  lower  exposure  to  ABT-450  substantially.  Furthermore,  there  is  an  increase  in 
buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine  exposure  on  co-administration  with  3DAA.  (also  discussed  in  the 
pharmacokinetics section). 
Hepatitis  C  virus  genotype  1-infected  adult  subjects  who  were  on  a  stable  opioid  replacement  therapy  of 
methadone or buprenorphine ± naloxone for at least 6 months prior to screening were eligible for the study. 
Patients were non-cirrhotic and either treatment naïve or had prior pegIFN/RBV treatment experience. Patients 
with HBV or HIV co-infection were excluded. 
All subjects were scheduled to receive 3DAA+RBV for 12 weeks. 
The study population comprised 38 patients, 66% of whom were male and 94,7% of whom were white. Mean 
age  was  48  years.  84%  had  genotype  1a  virus  and  32%  had  IL28B  C/C  genotype.  36/38  patients  were 
treatment naïve. 19 (50%) subjects were on methadone and 19 (50%) subjects were on buprenorphine +/- 
naloxone. 
37/38 patients achieved SVR, with one patient discontinuing the study prematurely.  
2.5.2.6.  Efficacy in patients with genotype 1 infection and HIV co-infection 
Study M14-004 is an ongoing, randomized, open-label trial to evaluated 3DAA coadministered with RBV for 12 
and 24 weeks in HCV GT1-infected subjects with HIV-1 coinfection. 
In part A of this study, for which SVR12 and safety data have been submitted, TN or pegIFN/RBV experienced 
patients with or without cirrhosis were included. Most patients had GT1a infection. Patients were treated with 
either an atazanavir or a raltegravir based antiretroviral regimen. The SVR rates were 29/31 (93.5%) and 29/32 
(90.6%) in the 12 and 24 week arms, respectively. Like previous studies with different interferon-free DAA 
regimens, these data are indicative that HIV co-infection does not impact the likelihood of SVR. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Each of the medicines were studied in dose ranging monotherapy studies in genotype 1. Subsequently each drug 
was  studied  in  combination  with  peginterferon  and  ribavirin  in  further  phase  IIa  dose  ranging.  This  is  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 112/150 
 
 
  
  
agreement with the paradigm that has prevailed during the recent transition from interferon based to interferon 
free anti-HCV therapy. 
After  a  few  exploratory  combination  studies,  the  company  performed  the  large  phase  IIa  study  AVIATOR 
(M13-652). This trial is crucial for informing on the drug combinations and durations that were subsequently 
studied in phase III. This drug development program comprises four active drugs – three direct acting antivirals 
of different classes, as well as ribavirin – and a pharmaco-enhancer. Thus, the number of potential combinations 
is very large. Adding to these parameters is the fact that also treatment duration was a factor to consider in the 
selection of the appropriate regimen. It is notable that factorial designs covering all possible combination are not 
only practically infeasible, but would also have been impossible, as several combinations would be anticipated to 
provide insufficient efficacy based on pharmacodynamic considerations and/or clinical trial experiences. In this 
context, it should be noted that all three DAAs select for resistant variants, and that there is therefore a need to 
protect patients from inadvertent non-curative exposure.  
The  company  has  further  presented  the  largest  interferon-free  phase  III  program  hitherto  submitted  for 
regulatory  evaluation.  There  are  five  studies  of  the  use  of  3DAAs  with  or  without  ribavirin  in  non-cirrhotic 
patients, 
further  classified  based  on 
treatment  experience 
(naïve  or  previously  exposed 
to 
peginterferon+ribavirin) and on viral sub genotype (1a versus -1b). The company has also performed the first 
phase III trial dedicated exclusively to (compensated) cirrhotics. The dossier is complemented by interim data 
from a study of ABT-450+ombitasvir +/- RBV in non-cirrhotic patients with genotype 4 infection and a study of 
the  use  of  3DAA+RBV  post-transplant  in  patients  with  genotype  1  infection  that  do  not  yet  have  advanced 
fibrosis. 
All  in  all,  the  rationale  for  the  design  of  this  drug  development  program  is  understood  and  there  are  no 
indications of particular deficiencies in its conduct. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In selecting the doses, the applicant has not only, as in the general case, needed to balance sufficient potency 
and  barrier  to  resistance  against  exposure  dependent  safety  concerns,  but  also  take  into  account 
multi-directional drug-drug interactions between the regimen components and the pharmacokinetic enhancer 
ritonavir. The company has adequately described this procedure and the rationale for the dose selection is in 
agreement with the antiviral drug development paradigm. For all three drugs, exposures at the selected dose 
are anticipated to yield maximal activity against wild-type virus. 
The AVIATOR study demonstrated that, in non-cirrhotic subjects, 8 weeks of therapy is submaximal and that 
more  than  12  weeks  did  not  add  efficacy.  These  findings  are  supported  by  other  data  on  interferon-free 
treatment regimens that have yielded similar results. Furthermore, this study clearly showed that the optimal 
regimen might differ between genotypes 1a and -1b.  
For  genotype  1a,  leaving  out  ombitasvir,  dasabuvir  or  ribavirin  from  the  regimen  yielded  lower  SVR  rates. 
Though perhaps not always statistically compelling, this is supported by PK/PD arguments and in particular by 
an understanding of differential barriers to resistance, as well as by sparse clinical observations.  
For genotype 1b, the additive value of a third agent, be it ombitasvir, dasabuvir or ribavirin is less clear cut. 
There are two on-going studies – M13-393 (PEARL-1) and M12-536 - in which the use of the dual combination 
of ABT-450 and dasabuvir is investigated in genotype 1b. While 0/42 treatment naïve non-cirrhotic patients 
experienced virological failure, data indicate a 6.6% virological failure rate among a total of 76 patients with the 
dual  DAA  combination  in  treatment  experienced  patients  with  genotype  1b.  Further,  there  is  a  numerical 
over-representation  of  baseline  NS5A  RAV  Y93H  in  those  that  fail.  There  are  similar  figures  from  other 
Assessment report

programs. Furthermore, it may be that adding a third drug would give some increment in efficacy in patients 
that are intrinsically “difficult to cure” due to host factors.  
It is notable that in weighing the benefit of a third agent, its side effects profile must be considered. Dasabuvir 
has a favourable side effects profile compared to ribavirin, which is the main driver of symptomatic adverse 
effects within the regimens tested, as will be clear from the analysis of safety. For such reasons, the company 
studied the 3DAA regimen without ribavirin in phase III, rather than either of the 2DAA regimens with ribavirin. 
However, the efficacy of 2DAA+RBV for 12 weeks in non-cirrhotic patients with GT1b is likely to be similar as 
that of 3DAA, as shown in the AVIATOR study and further supported by a reverse bridging argument (GT4 to 
GT1b) based on the M13-393 study. 
The phase III program has demonstrated excellent efficacy with 99% SVR when 12 weeks of 3DAA is given to 
non-cirrhotic  patients  with  genotype  1b, 
regardless  of  host 
factors  and  prior  exposure 
to 
peginterferon+ribavirin, which does not per se impact response to the DAAs. Patients with prior DAA exposure 
were not included in this study program, as in most cases these would have previously selected for variants 
cross-resistant to one of the DAAs in the present regimen).

Concerning genotype 1a, the important PEARL-IV study clearly shows the advantage of adding ribavirin to the 
3DAA  when  treating  for  12  weeks  (and  likely  also  compared  to  a  longer  treatment  duration,  as  some 
on-treatment virological failure was seen when ribavirin was excluded from the regimen); whereas the SVR rate 
was 97% with 3DAA+RBV, it was 90% without RBV. These data are supported by results from the AVIATOR 
study.  The  numerical  difference  is  somewhat  greater  in  IL28B  non  C/C  genotype,  compared  to  the  smaller 
sample with C/C genotype. Baseline resistance does not clearly identify patients likely to fail without ribavirin; 
the  numerical  over-representation  of  patients  with  the  Q80K  variant  among  failures,  however,  is  noted  and 
should be further discussed. 
Based on these data, the company proposes that 3DAA+RBV is the recommended regimen in genotype 1a. This 
is supported.

In general, rates of virological failure on DAA regimens tend to be somewhat higher in patients with cirrhosis, 
with 12 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, as more drug pressure is required for maximal efficacy, the differential 
effect of adding ribavirin may be somewhat greater in such patients. Moreover, there were no cirrhotic patients 
in the AVIATOR study. Therefore, the TURQUOISE-II study (M13-399) compared 3DAA+RBV for 12 versus 24 
weeks  in  compensated  cirrhotic  patients  with  either  of  the  genotype  1  subgenotypes,  and  with  or  without 
treatment  experience  (peginterferon+ribavirin).  Results  were  again  excellent  in  patients  with  genotype  1b 
infection,  with  a  single  relapse  among  64  patients  treated  for  12  weeks  (including  46  previously 
peginterferon+ribavirin treated patients). 
For genotype 1a, efficacy was somewhat lower, with 92-93% SVR in treatment naïve patients. In patients with 
prior peginterferon+ribavirin experience, preselected as a difficult to cure subgroup of a general population, 12 
weeks of therapy yielded 85.5% SVR versus 95.5% SVR with 24 weeks. However, it is notable that 10-20% of 
a  treatment  naïve  genotype  1  population  would-be  null  responders  if  subjected  to  peginterferon+ribavirin 
therapy.  Furthermore,  a  similar  trend  for  24  weeks  is  seen  in  treatment  naïve  patients  with  IL28B  non  C/C 
Assessment report

genotype  (from  which  null  responders  are  generally  selected),  as  well  as  in  patients  with  low  platelets  at 
baseline, comprising those with most advanced but yet compensated disease. 
SVR is considered a clinical imperative in patients with compensated cirrhosis to avoid disease progression with 
decompensation, which may be imminent. Furthermore, effective retreatment alternatives may not be readily 
available for cirrhotic patients failing with emergence of resistance to NS3/4A and NS5A inhibitors +/- resistance 
to dasabuvir.  
In the full dataset, the relapse rate among patients with GT1a in the 12 week arm was 11/140 (8%) versus 
1/121 (1%) in the 24 week arm. Counting the patient in the 24 week arm with on-treatment breakthrough at 
day 97 as a “relapse” (as this breakthrough occurred after 12 weeks of therapy), the point estimate would be 
2/121 (1.5%). 
During  the  assessment  procedure,  the  applicant  proposed  different  algorithms  to  identify  a  subset  of  GT1a 
cirrhotic patients for whom 24 weeks of therapy would be indicated, presuming that those not fulfilling criteria 
might be treated for 12 weeks. These include prior null responder status or, alternatively, having one or more 
biomarkers of more advanced disease (platelets, alfa-fetoprotein, albumin) with certain cut-offs (see above). 
Such approaches however, are fraught with uncertainty. Given the similar tolerability of 12 and 24 weeks of 
therapy (the proportion of patients stopping therapy due to adverse events in the Turquoise study was 4/208 
versus 4/172 for the two durations), and the abovementioned uncertainty of the effectiveness of retreatment 
options, a 24 week course of therapy is considered appropriate for all GT1a patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP agreed to include the information originating from the post hoc analysis on the risk of 
relapse in subgroups of GT1a cirrhotics in section 5.1. of the Exviera SmPC. 
As anticipated based on virological findings, the efficacy of ABT-450+ombitasvir+ribavirin for 12 weeks is very 
high  in  non-cirrhotic  patients  with  genotype  4,  with  100%  SVR  among  91  patients  presented  in  an  interim 
analysis  from  the  PEARL-1  study.  This  supports  an  indication  in  such  patients,  including  those  with  prior 
exposure to peginterferon+ribavirin. Available in vitro and resistance selection data indicate the possibility of 
bridging efficacy from genotype 1b to 4 and vice versa. On the basis of the efficacy of 2DAA without RBV for 24 
weeks  in  compensated  cirrhotics  with  genotype  1b  in  the  M13-393  study,  the  applicant  proposes  that 
2DAA+RBV for 24 weeks may be inferred to show high efficacy in patients with GT4 infection and compensated 
cirrhosis. This is accepted. 
These  drugs  in  combination  have  not  been  thoroughly  developed  in  other  genotypes;  notably,  efficacy  is 
anticipated to be genotype dependent for at least ABT-450 and dasabuvir. 
A  further  interim  analysis  has  demonstrated  high  efficacy  of  3DAA+RBV  in  post-transplant  patients  without 
advanced fibrosis. Further data from those with more advanced liver disease are eagerly awaited, but not within 
the approval procedure. 
There are no data in patients with decompensated liver disease. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall 3DAA without ribavirin and 3 DAA+RBV for 12 weeks in non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients, respectively, 
with  genotype  1b  has  demonstrated  outstanding  efficacy,  as  has  3DAA+RBV  for  12  weeks  in  non-cirrhotic 
patients with genotype 1a. In compensated cirrhotic patients with genotype 1a, the relapse rate was higher with 
12 compared to 24 weeks. ABT-450+ombitasvir+ RBV is highly effective in patients with genotype 4. Failure of

these regimens is often associated with the selection of dual class resistance, with or without further resistance 
to dasabuvir; in such cases, appropriate retreatment alternatives may not always be obvious. 
Outstanding  issues  include  the  appropriate  treatment  duration  in  subsets  of  patients  with  genotype  1a  and 
compensated cirrhosis, as well as which patients with genotype 1a virus could be suitable for RBV-free therapy 
if this is needed. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database submitted at the time of the application for the 3-DAA regimen contained data from 6 Phase 
3 and 2 Phase 2 studies in HCV GT1-infected adult subjects (Phase 3 Studies M11-646, M13-098, M13-099, 
M13-389, M13-961, and M14-002 and Phase 2 Studies M11-652 and M14-103) that included administration of 
the 3 DAAs in combination with and without RBV at the proposed doses or higher—ABT-450 150 mg once daily 
(QD), ritonavir 100 mg QD, ABT-267 25 mg QD, and ABT-333 250 mg twice daily (BID).  
In  addition,  17  Phase  1  studies  that  evaluated  safety  in  healthy  volunteers  who  received  multiple  doses  of 
ABT-450/r  +  ABT-267  +  ABT-333  at  the  proposed  doses  or  higher  of  each  of  the  DAAs  are  included  in  the 
provided integrated summary of safety (ISS). 
The safety population consisted of the following subjects for each analysis set: 
• 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind 
study drug in a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study (SAPPHIRE I and –II); 
•  Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in 
a Phase 3 regimen-controlled study (PEARL II, -III and –IV) 
• 
• 
Phase 2 and 3 (All Treated) Analysis Set: all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of active 
(3-DAA +/-RBV) study drug at the proposed dose or higher in a Phase 2 or 3 study; 
Phase 1 Analysis Set: all healthy volunteers who received multiple doses of the 3-DAA regimen at the 
proposed  dose  or  higher  of  each  of  the  DAAs  in  the  regimen  in  a  Phase  1  study.  For  drug-drug 
interactions studies, only data from period/days during which the DAAs were administered without the 
interacting drug were included in the pooled analyses. 
Thus  3DAA+RBV  was  compared  with  placebo  in  two  randomised  phase  III  trials,  whereas  3DAA+RBV  was 
compared with 3DAA in three randomised phase III trials. This allows for some disentanglement of the side 
effect profile of the 3DAA per se versus that of placebo, through cross study comparison. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2,632 subjects received at least 1 dose of 3 DAAs ± RBV and were included in the All Treated Analysis 
Set. The median number of days of treatment for all subjects was 84 days, with greater than 95% of subjects 
receiving more than 60 days of treatment. The size of the safety database considerably exceeds the existing ICH 
recommendations.

The proposed treatment duration is 84 days in most patients, and 168 days in some compensated cirrhotics. 
The majority of subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set were white (90.5% total); 57.3% of all subjects were 
male and mean age was 51.6 years overall. Overall, a total of 188 (7.1%) subjects were black and 163 (6.2%) 
subjects were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  The majority of subjects participated at sites in the US (45.0%) 
and  European  Union  (40.7%).  The  representation  of  non-white  subjects  was  relatively  low,  whereas  EU 
representation is considerable. 
The  majority  of  subjects  were  treatment-naïve  (68.0%)  and  had  minimal  fibrosis  (F0  –  F1,  59.8%).  The 
proportion of patients with minimal fibrosis is notable; however, the applicant has performed a substantially 
sized phase III trial dedicated to patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
The All Treated Analysis Set included 690 subjects (26.2%) with a history of hypertension, 482 (18.3%) with a 
past  or  current  history  of  depression  or  bipolar  disorder,  and  169  subjects  (6.4%)  with  a  past  or  current 
diagnosis of diabetes. The inclusion of a large proportion of patients with prior psychiatric issues is notable as 
such medical problems form relative contraindications and often prevent interferon-based therapy. 
The all treated analysis set included 385 patients with compensated cirrhosis, 383 of whom were treated with 
3DAA+RBV.

Adverse events 
The 3DAA combination of ABT-450(r), ombitasvir and dasabuvir was investigated in combination with ribavirin, 
in two randomised, placebo controlled phase III trials; furthermore this combination was studied with or without 
ribavirin in three randomised, controlled trials. Notably, the side effect profile of ribavirin is well understood, and 
includes primarily haemolytic anaemia, secondary hyperbilirubinaemia, pruritus, rash, dry skin, fatigue, cough 
and neuropsychiatric side effects such as insomnia and irritability.

a.  As assessed by the investigator. 
The frequency of any side effect or any side effect considered reasonably attributable to a DAA was similar in 
placebo-treated patients and patients treated with 3DAA without ribavirin. The frequency of severe or serious 
side effects, however, was numerically somewhat higher with 3DAA compared to placebo, though still relatively 
low (1.4% versus 0.4% for serious AEs). The side effect burden was clearly higher when ribavirin was added to 
the 3DAAs. Similar to previous observations in other settings, dose modifications of ribavirin (mostly due to 
anaemia) were not associated with lower efficacy.  
In the all-treated analysis set, the frequency of serious adverse events when using the 3DAA regimen with or 
without  ribavirin  was  2.5%,  the  frequency  of  AEs  leading  to  drug  discontinuation  was  1%.  The  all  treated 
analysis set contains one fatal adverse event, discussed further below under the section on hepatic safety.

Fatigue, asthenia, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, pruritus and rash were the most common treatment-emergent 
adverse  events  when  using  3DAA+RBV.  Also,  anaemia  was  only  reported  among  patients  treated  with 
3DAA+RBV, but not with placebo.

Notes:  Order is by decreasing risk difference. 
Anaemia, insomnia, pruritus, asthenia and increased bilirubin are more common when the 3DAA are used with 
RBV. All of these side effects have previously been associated with ribavirin use. Also nausea is more commonly 
reported with RBV than without RBV.  
With the relevant caveats of cross study comparison, the following table further informs on the contribution of 
RBV to the side effects profile of the treatment regimen.

d.  Risk difference was calculated as the percentage of subjects in the 3-DAA + RBV treatment group minus the percentage of subjects in 
the placebo treatment group (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) or as the percentage of subjects in the 3-DAA + RBV treatment group 
minus the percentage of subjects in the 3-DAA treatment group (Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set). 
Note: 
Order is by decreasing magnitude of risk difference in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. 
It may be concluded that on cross study comparison none of these common side effects were clearly numerically 
more  frequently  reported  with  the  3DAA  regimen  compared  to  placebo,  and  that  the  bulk  of  the  treatment 
emergent AEs arising from the use of 3DAA+RBV are due to RBV and are also characteristic of the known side 
effects profile of this compound. Risk differences indicate that the 3DAAs may cause fatigue and pruritus. The 
latter has been seen with other macrocyclic NS3/4A inhibitors, and may be due to the impact of ABT-450 on 
biliary transporters such as BSEP. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Three  deaths  were  reported  among  subjects  in  the  All  Treated  Analysis  Set.  Of  the  3  deaths,  none  was 
considered related to study drug and 2 were due to non-treatment emergent adverse events.  
•  One subject in Study M11-646 (3-DAA + RBV) died during the Post Treatment Period, 221 days after the 
last dose of study drug, due to treatment-emergent adverse events of non-small cell lung cancer and 
mediastinal mass that began 15 days after the last dose of study drug. 
•  One  subject  in  Study  M11-652  (3-DAA)  died  67  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  due  to 
non-treatment-emergent adverse events of coronary artery stenosis and arteriosclerosis. 
•  One subject in Study M13-099 (3-DAA + RBV) had severe lactic acidosis in the setting of metformin use 
and multi-organ failure in the setting of severe hypotension and lactic acidosis.  The subject went on to 
receive a liver transplant 3 days after the last dose of study drug.  The subject died 84 days after the last 
dose of study drug due to non-treatment emergent adverse events including multi-organ failure and 
septic shock that began 80 days after the last dose of study drug.

No pattern in the type of adverse events leading to death in the All Treated Analysis Set was observed, and the 
events are considered unlikely to be causally associated with treatment.  
Serious adverse events 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  was  (0.4%  to  2.7%  across  treatment 
groups in each analysis set (Table 6 and Table 7).  
Of the 65 subjects with treatment-emergent serious adverse events in the All Treated Analysis Set (Table 7), 11 
subjects experienced treatment-emergent serious adverse events assessed by the investigator as being related 
or as having a reasonable possibility of being related to DAA treatment  
One subject in the Phase 1 Analysis Set experienced a treatment-emergent serious adverse event. One subject 
from Study M13-782 experienced a spontaneous abortion during the first 12 weeks of gestation, which was 
considered by the investigator to be moderate in severity and to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to 
both DAA and RBV treatment.  This subject had a risk factor of advanced maternal age.

Haematology 
Mean Change from Baseline in Haemoglobin (g/L) (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) 
Anaemia is a well-recognized RBV-related toxicity. The magnitude of the mean decrease in haemoglobin seen in 
the 3DAA+RBV group (compared with placebo, below) is typical of the ribavirin dose used. 
The  following  graph,  comparing  the  impact  on  haemoglobin  of  3DAA+RBV  versus  3DAA  without  ribavirin  is 
indicative that the effect is indeed largely due to RBV, though it may be that the 3DAA (perhaps dasabuvir – see 
discussion above on dose selection) may provide a very minor contribution to this effect.

Four 
treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  were 
reported  among 
these  anaemia-related 
treatment-emergent  adverse  events.  These  include  3  subjects  who  had  RBV  dose  modification  (including 
1 subject whose nadir haemoglobin was 86 g/L and 1 subject who interrupted study drug) and 3 subjects who 
had a blood transfusion. The percentage of subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set who received erythropoietin 
or  a  blood  transfusion  was  low  (<  0.5%).  All  in  all,  in  terms  of  anaemia,  ribavirin  seems  roughly  similarly 
tolerated in combination with these DAAs, as seen in other interferon-free studies. 
Clinical chemistry 
With  the  exception  of  liver  function  tests,  which  are  further  discussed  below,  the  rate  of  clinically  relevant 
treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities was low. The impact of ribavirin-associated haemolysis on serum 
bilirubin was apparent – the proportion of patients with bilirubin >2xULN was 12% versus 2% with and without 
ribavirin.

2.6.1.  Hepatic safety 
As anticipated, in the general case, suppression of HCV replication with direct acting antivirals leads to prompt 
normalization of ALT due to a reduction of hepatic inflammation. This is demonstrated in the figure below. 
Mean Change from Baseline in ALT (U/L) (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) 
However, as discussed above, under the section on dose selection, ABT-450 shows a dose-dependent tendency 
to cause treatment-emergent increases in transaminases. Furthermore, this drug is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 
–B3. Also, all three DAAs are described as inhibitors of UGT1A1. Therefore, the 3DAA combination is a cause of 
mechanistic (mainly indirect) hyperbilirubinaemia. This complicates the assessment of potential cases of drug 
induced liver injury (DILI). 
In the placebo-controlled analysis set, the percentages of subjects (3DAA versus placebo) with at least grade 2 
post-baseline ALT values were 2.2% [17/765] versus 16.1% [41/254]) or at least grade 3 (1.2% [9/765] versus 
3.9%  [10/254].  The  higher  frequency  of  low  level  ALT  increases  in  the  placebo  group  is  anticipated,  as 
fluctuating transaminase increases are common in hepatitis C. In general, virological suppression is associated 
with biochemical response in the form of ALT normalisation. 
In the regimen-controlled analysis set, the percentages of subjects in the 3-DAA + RBV and 3-DAA treatment 
groups with at least grade 2 (2.0% [8/401] and 1.8% [9/509], respectively) or at least grade 3 (0.7% [3/401] 
and  0.2%  [1/509],  respectively)  post-baseline  ALT  values  were  similar.  A  similar  pattern  of  results  was 
observed for AST. 
In  the  all  treated  analysis  set,  the  percentages  with  at  least  grade  2  post-baseline  ALT  values  were  2.2% 
[59/2626]) and at least grade 3 were 1.0% [26/2626]). A similar pattern of results was observed for AST. Six 
(0.2%) subjects (all 3-DAA + RBV) had a post-baseline grade 4 ALT value. One of these 6 subjects also had a 
post-baseline grade 4 AST value. 
The following table illustrates the relation between ABT-450 dose and ALT increases, as well as the impact of 
concomitant systemic oestrogen-containing medications.

Thus, there are two salient aspects of the treatment emergent transaminitis associated with the 3DAA combo. 
First, as stated above, it is a dose and therefore exposure related side effect of ABT-450. Second, the risk of 
transaminitis  is  strikingly  increased  with  concomitant  administration  of  systemic  oestrogen-containing 
medications. Notably, Grade 3 or higher ALT elevations were not observed in subjects receiving progestins only 
or  subjects  receiving  topical  vaginal  oestrogen  preparations.  A  logistic  regression  analysis  also  identified 
systemic  oestrogen  co-medication  as  a  risk  factor  for  grade  3+  ALT  increases.  Cirrhosis,  however,  was  not 
identified as a risk factor. 
In a further subanalysis, patients on ethinyl estradiol (rather than other oestrogens such as oestradiol, estriol 
and conjugated oestrogens) were the driver of the excess transaminitis rates noted above.

The difference in frequency between those receiving RBV and those that do not, is not significant when systemic 
oestrogen use is taken into account. 
Although the typical signature event observed was an early rise in serum ALT/AST peaking at 2 weeks with 
subsequent resolution despite continued drug treatment, variations on this theme were observed.  
In the phase III studies, the following algorithm was used to manage confirmed ALT increases. 
In some of the studies this was qualified by a requirement that ALT be >2x baseline.

The  number  of  patients  discontinuing  study  therapy  due  to  ALT  or  transaminase  increases  was  very  low  – 
2/2632 in the all treated analysis set. 
The following graphs illustrate the time-course of treatment emergent hyperbilirubinaemia (indirect and direct).

The predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinaemia is apparent, with a maximum occurring at week 1 – that is, 
typically somewhat earlier than the onset of grade 3+ transaminitis. 
The overall incidence of bilirubin-related treatment-emergent adverse events in the All Treated Analysis Set was 
3.8%; the incidence of jaundice, ocular icterus, and yellow skin was 1.9%, 0.6%, and 0.1%, respectively. The 
overall  incidence  of  gallbladder-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events,  including  cholecystitis, 
cholecystitis acute, cholecystitis chronic, and cholelithiasis, in the all treated analysis set was 0.2%. 
Potential Hy’s law cases and the company expert adjudication panel 
An “eDISH” representation of subjects who received the 3-DAA regimen, with or without RBV, has been provided 
for the All Treated Analysis Set. In this, ALT is plotted versus total bilirubin, and patients in the upper right 
quadrant are identified as possibly fulfilling Hy’s law.

Figure 3. 
eDISH Plot (All Treated Analysis Set) 
Approximately 1% of patients are found in the Hy’s law quadrant. Notably, all were also treated with ribavirin, 
which causes indirect hyperbilirubinaemia due to haemolysis. 
The applicant convened an external hepatic expert panel that was not provided treatment assignment reviewed 
hepatic laboratory and clinically relevant data from all subjects whose ALT and total bilirubin values were in the 
Hy's quadrant of the eDISH plot, and any subject with a post-baseline serum ALT > 5 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) without a total bilirubin elevation ≥ 2 × ULN (subset of Temple's corollary quadrant). The panel concluded 
that none of these 32 subjects met criteria for Hy’s law, as the elevations in total bilirubin in these cases were 
temporally inconsistent with Hy's law in that they preceded the peak serum ALT elevations, a result consistent 
with inhibition of bilirubin transporters by ABT-450 (see above). Moreover, the peak total bilirubin elevations 
were predominantly indirect bilirubin, a finding inconsistent with Hy's law, and again consistent with inhibition of 
bilirubin transporters and exacerbation by RBV-induced haemolysis. 
Of the 32 subjects evaluated by the external hepatic expert panel, treatment-emergent adverse events led to 
interruption of study drug in 3 subjects and discontinuation of study drug in 2 subjects. In all cases, serum ALT 
improved or resolved by end of treatment. 
The majority of these 32 subjects completed study drug with ALT levels that had declined from the peak value 
and that were normal or grade 1 by the Final Treatment Visit or by Post-Treatment Week 4. 
Seven of the 32 subjects were taking systemic oestrogen-containing medication and 5 of these subjects also 
discontinued the hormones. Two of these 5 subjects interrupted the study drug regimen.  All 5 subjects had 
improvement and normalization of ALT.  Among the remaining 2 subjects, 1 subject discontinued study drug 
with return to baseline of serum ALT and 1 subject continued both study drug and the hormonal contraceptive 
with resolution of serum ALT by post-treatment week 2.

There was one case of on treatment liver failure in the safety database. This was a 64 year old white female with 
CPT-A cirrhosis, metformin-treated diabetes type II and hypertension. This patient was hospitalised shortly after 
starting  therapy  for  treatment  of  oedema  of  unknown  cause.  On  day  9  after  starting  therapy  the  patient 
experienced circulatory shock and lactic acidosis, which was possibly metformin-related. Subsequently there 
was multiorgan-failure, including liver failure. In this case it appears that circulatory shock preceded liver failure 
and a causal relation to 3DAA treatment does not seem likely. During the review procedure, the company was 
asked for an update on total exposure to paritaprevir and on any serious liver related adverse events. Among a 
total of 4,589 patients exposed, there were no further on-treatment hepatic failure reported.   
Safety in special populations 
Sex 
A greater percentage of females versus males had at least 1 post-baseline grade 2 haemoglobin result (10.3% 
versus 1.8%). The somewhat lower tolerability of ribavirin in women has been seen in other studies also, and is 
presumably due to lower baseline haemoglobin counts. 
The frequency of at least grade 2 ALT elevations was 2.3% in males and 2.1% in females; the frequency of at 
least grade 3 elevations was 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. 
Age and race 
There were fewer subjects ≥65 years of age (N = 62 for the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, N = 87 for the 
Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set) and fewer black subjects (N = 70 for the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, N = 
69 for the Regimen-Controlled Analysis Set) compared with subjects < 65 years of age. That stated, within each 
age group (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years) or each race group (black, non-black), the treatment-group differences in 
the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and the percentage of subjects with haemoglobin and liver 
function test values by maximum grade were generally consistent with those observed in the overall analysis. 
Cirrhosis 
The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to those observed in non-cirrhotic subjects. 
The overall incidence of treatment emergent serious adverse events (5.5%) and treatment emergent adverse 
events leading to premature discontinuation of study drug was 2.1% and thus somewhat higher than observed 
in subjects without cirrhosis. There was no commonality evident among these events. 
A  greater  frequency  of  total  bilirubin  elevations  and  anaemia-related  events  was  observed  in  cirrhotics 
compared with Phase 3 clinical studies of AbbVie DAAs with RBV in subjects without cirrhosis. This is in line with 
previous  experiences  of  the  use  of  ribavirin  in  cirrhotics.  No  subject  discontinued  due  to  symptomatic 
hyperbilirubinaemia. 
Importantly,  the  safety  of  ABT-450(r),  ombitasvir  and  dasabuvir  in  patients  with  HCV  and  decompensated 
cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B and –C) has not been described. 
Post-transplant 
The  applicant  has  submitted  interim  results  from  the  M12-999  study  of  3DAA+RBV  for  24  weeks  in  a 
post-transplant population that does not have advanced fibrosis. Overall safety was as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 133/150 
  
  
Anaemia  was  reported  at  a  higher  rate  in  this  post-transplant  population  than  in  the  general  treatment 
population (20% versus less than 10%). This is anticipated, notwithstanding the lower mean starting dose of 
ribavirin. The most frequently selected RBV dose range at the initiation of therapy was 600 – 800 mg per day 
(19/34 subjects; 55.9%). This was also the most common RBV dose at completion of the study regimen (23/34 
subjects; 67.6%). Overall, 19 (55.9%) subjects dose modified RBV. No subject received a transfusion.  Five 
subjects received erythropoietin No subject initiating RBV at doses of 800 mg or less per day interrupted RBV for 
anaemia or required erythropoietin. 
CNI levels were monitored closely throughout the study by means of post-dose testing to inform the scheduling 
of  the  next  dose.  No  subject  had  a  reported  event  of  rejection.  There  was  no  apparent  signal  of  increased 
hepatotoxicity in this population. 
2.6.1.1.  HCV/HIV coinfection 
Viekirax contains low dose ritonavir (100 mg qd), which may  select for PI resistance in co-infected patients 
without suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Based on in vitro studies the applicant considers that this risk is not 
relevant. However, the possibility of bridging from in vitro to in vivo in this particular regard is unclear. In the 
absence of reassuring in vivo data, ritonavir co-formulated with paritaprevir and ombitasvir should only be given 
to co-infected patients in the setting of effective antiretroviral therapy. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As described in the section on pharmacokinetics, the drug-drug interaction profile of these ritonavir-boosted 
combination  regimens  are  very  complex.  Apart  from  a  considerable  range  of  potentially  significant 
pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions,  two  pharmacodynamics  interactions  have  been  identified,  where  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 134/150 
 
 
  
  
hepatotoxicity of ABT-450, in combination with other agents, appear to be augmented. The drugs implicated are 
ethinyl estradiol and efavirenz. In the first case, the mechanism is unclear; the same to some extent pertains to 
the efavirenz interaction, though the applicant argues that this may represent a negative effect of combining 
ritonavir  with  a  significant  inducer,  as  similar  findings  as  those  for  efavirenz  have  been  reported  in  other 
interaction studies with ritonavir and efavirenz or rifampicin.  
Some antiretrovirals are considered acceptable as alternatives for co-treatment, despite the fact that rather 
substantial exposure effects are seen: 
The decrease seen for darunavir exposure (darunavir dosed 800 mg qd) is considered unlikely to affect viral 
suppression in the absence of extensive PI resistance, during the limited treatment duration in question. 
The 2-fold increase in raltegravir exposure is not considered a safety issue, on the basis on what is known for 
this agent and class. A similar increase in exposure for dolutegravir (not studied) is expected. Dolutegravir is 
approved for 50 mg q.d. and b.i.d., and the lower dose is therefore considered a safe alternative. 
Rilpivirine  exposure  is  increased  3-fold,  which  may  have  a  potential  for  QT-prolongation.  However,  a  2-fold 
increase  is  deemed  safe  (seen  with  rilpivirine  in  combination  with  boosted  HIV  protease  inhibitors). 
Furthermore, in addition to the approved dose of rilpivirine (i.e. 25 mg qd), doses of 75 mg qd and 150 mg qd 
were studied over 96 weeks in the rilpivirine phase 2 studies, without QTc-problems noted. Therefore, also the 
combination with rilpivirine is considered acceptable, in the setting of ECG-monitoring. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to interruption of study drug was low (0% 
to  2.0%  across  treatment  groups)  in  each  analysis  set.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  leading  to 
interruption  of  study  drug  for  at  least  2  subjects  in  the  All  Treated  Analysis  Set  were  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
vomiting, asthenia, fall, alanine aminotransferase increased, and haemoglobin decreased (2 [< 0.1%] subjects 
each, all 3-DAA + RBV) 
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to RBV dose modification occurred in 6.0% of all subjects in the All 
Treated Analysis Set. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to RBV dose modification reported for more 
than 1.0% of subjects were anaemia (3.3%) and haemoglobin decreased (1.6%). 
All in all, this four or five drug combo is very well-tolerated. Transaminase increases are mainly asymptomatic 
and only prompted treatment discontinuation in two cases. Ribavirin dose reductions were not associated with 
lower efficacy.   
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  primary  (“all-treated”)  safety  database  for  this  application  comprises  approximately  2600  patients  that 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  3DAAs+/-  RBV,  and  thus  exceeds  ICH  recommendations.  The  tolerability  of  this 
combination is very good, with serious adverse events emerging in approximately 2% of patients treated with 
3DAA+RBV and 1.4% in those treated with 3DAA without RBV. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 0.4% with 
3DAA and somewhat higher with 3DAA+RBV. 
As for the individual components, ABT-450 has shown an exposure dependent risk of transaminitis, which was 
considered dose limiting. All in all, in the “all treated” analysis set. 2.2% of patients had at least grade 2 ALT 
increases and 1% had at least grade 3 increases. Furthermore, ABT-450 is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, -B3 as well 
Assessment report  
EMA/768346/2014 
Page 135/150 
  
  
as  UGT1A1.  Therefore,  it  is  a  cause  of  mechanistic  hyperbilirubinaemia,  which  is  augmented  when  given  in 
combination with RBV - exposure to which induces haemolytic anaemia.  
As with other NS5A inhibitors, no specific side effects have been associated with ombitasvir. 
The development program of dasabuvir indicates that this drug at high exposure may have some negative effect 
on haemoglobin, and also that it has a dose-dependent, albeit limited, QT-prolonging potential. At the proposed 
doses, the 3DAA regimen is not anticipated to cause clinically relevant QT prolongation. 
As an important part of the rationale to study 3DAA in phase III rather than ABT-450 + ABT-267+RBV, the 
company considers that the emerging safety profile indicates that dasabuvir is better tolerated than ribavirin. A 
comparison  of  symptomatic  side  effects  in  the  M11-652  (AVIATOR)  study,  where  these  two  regimens  were 
directly compared, is as follows. 
As  anticipated,  the  incidence  of  anaemia  and  hyperbilirubinaemia  was  higher  with  ribavirin  compared  to 
dasabuvir. Whereas 52.4% of patients on ribavirin had at least a grade 1 decrease in haemoglobin with ribavirin, 
the same figure with the three DAA was 8.9% Also the frequency of post-baseline at least grade 3 ALT increases 
was higher with ribavirin - 4.2% versus 0%. Thus, data support the argument of the applicant. 
The drug development program as a whole indicates that the 3DAA combination without ribavirin may cause 
pruritus as a common adverse effect. With the addition of ribavirin, side effects such as anaemia, asthenia, 
insomnia,  rash,  dry  skin  and  indirect  bilirubinaemia  increase  in  frequency.  This  is  typical  of  the  previously 
described side effects profile of ribavirin.

Paritaprevir  as  a  component  of  these  regimens  is  a  cause  of  transaminitis,  seen  at  grade  3  or  more  in 
approximatel 1% of treated patients. Treatment emergent transaminitis is usually mild and asymptomatic, and 
is often transient despite treatment continuation; very few patients discontinued therapy due to ALT increases. 
There is an association of the concomitant use of ethinyl estradiol-containing drugs and the risk of transaminitis. 
The risk of at least grade 3 ALT increases was approximately 1% in those not treated with ethinyl estradiol 
versus  approximately  25%  in  the  somewhat  more  than  20  patients  receiving  concomitant  therapy.  In  most 
cases  the  ALT  increases  resolved  on  continued  3AA  therapy,  in  some  cases  after  discontinuation  of  the 
oestrogen.  In  the  phase  III  studies,  a  stopping  algorithm  whereby  patients  with  ALT  increases  >10xULN  or 
>5xULN if accompanied by signs and symptoms of hepatitis should discontinue antiviral therapy. Only 2 patients 
were reported to discontinue the 3DAA regimen due to transaminitis. It is notable that stopping therapy would 
be associated with rebound or relapse with virus resistant to the NS3/4A and/or NS5A classes. 
The applicant identified 32 patients either potentially fulfilling Hy’s law, or having increases of ALT >5x ULN 
without fulfilling the bilirubin criteria. In many of these cases, bilirubinaemia is either indirect or clearly precedes 
ALT increases. There was one on-treatment case of hepatic failure. This has been extensively reviewed and a 
causal relation with HCV treatment is considered unlikely. Thus, within this drug development program, there is 
no evidence that paritaprevir or the 3DAA regimen is a causative agent of serious DILI with hepatic failure. This 
includes a relatively large experience in patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
On-treatment monitoring of transaminases is not recommended, as transaminitis is generally transitory with 
continued  therapy,  there  is  no  evidence  of  its  development  into  failure  of  hepatic  function,  and  there  is  no 
information on what level of increase should mandate treatment discontinuation, which may lead to dual or 
triple class drug resistance with uncertain retreatment options on relapse of previously suppressed virus. The 
relevant findings on transaminitis and bilirubinemia, however, are described in detail in the product information. 
13 out of 23 patients with taking concomitant EE experience on-treatment transaminase increases, while 5 out 
of 23 patients had grade 4 transaminitis. One patient had grade 4 transaminitis and concomitant nausea, and 
discontinued under the investigator-reported diagnosis of “acute hepatitis”. The concerns raised are supported 
by findings in a DDI study in healthy volonteers, There two arms with different progestins in combination with 
EE were discontinued due to transaminase increases. There were no transaminase increases in the progestin 
only arm. This supports the inference that the interaction is indeed due to the EE component. Progestins when 
given alone or in combination with other estrogens have not shown the same association. . The safety database 
for concomitant treatment with EE is too small to ascertain acceptable liver safety. If needed, other effective 
contraceptive measures should be instituted prior to therapy, which is always elective as to its precise timing. 
The reasons why a contraindication is preferred to ALT monitoring are the high frequency of grade 3 or more 
changes, the impossibility of defining an operational cut-off for corrective action (discontinuation of EE or the 
DAA regimen) and the fact that inadvertent discontinuation of the EE regimen may lead to dual or triple class 
resistance with unclear retreatment options (see above).  
The safety dataset on systemic non-EE estrogens is considered sufficiently reassuring to support the limitation 
of the proposed contraindication to ethinyl estradiol. 
ABT-450  exposure  is  moderately  increased  in  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (62%  increase)  and  increased 
9.5-fold in severe hepatic impairment. There are no efficacy and safety data available in these populations. The 
applicant proposed that the 3DAA combination should be contraindicated patients with Child-Pugh C, whereas 
the product information reports that there are no data on efficacy and safety in patients with Child-Pugh B. This 
is supported.

2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
This triple DAA combination, which also includes ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, and furthermore in 
many cases should be used in combination with ribavirin, has been shown generally well tolerated with low rates 
of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations. The drug combination may cause transaminitis and 
mechanistic  hyperbilirubinemia;  however  an  association  with  progression  to  serious  DILI  including  hepatic 
failure has not been established. Due to a high frequency of higher grade transaminitis, the combination with 
ethinyl  oestradiol  is  contraindicated;  forms  of  effective  contraception  without  this  drug  must  be  used  when 
needed.  Due  to  the  ritonavir  component,  there  is  a  high  propensity  for  potentially  important  drug-drug 
interactions. This has been extensively addressed in the product information.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In  non-cirrhotic,  treatment  naive  patients  with  genotype  1a  infection,  the  combination  of  3DAA 
(ritonavir-boosted ABT-450, ombitasvir, dasabuvir)+RBV yielded an SVR (sustained virologic response) rate of 
95.7%  (404/422)  across  the  SAPPHIRE-I  and  PEARL-IV  studies.  In  non-cirrhotic  pegIFN+RBV  experienced 
patients,  the  SVR  rate  was  96%  (166/173)  (SAPPHIRE-II  study).  In  the  PEARL  IV  study  (non-cirrhotic, 
treatment naïve) 3DAA without RBV gave 90.2% (185/205) SVR rate. Within that study, this was almost 7% 
higher when RBV was added (SVR rate 97%, 97/100). 
In non-cirrhotic, treatment naïve patients with genotype 1b infection, the combination of 3DAA+RBV yielded an 
SVR  rate  of  98.9%  (357/361)  across  the  SAPPHIRE-I  and  PEARL-III  studies.  In  non-cirrhotic,  pegIFN+RBV 
experienced patients, the SVR rate was 96.7% (205/212). As opposed to the case with genotype 1a, 3DAA 
without RBV were shown to be similarly effective as 3DAA with RBV. In the PEARL-II study, the SVR rate with 
3DAA was 100% (91/91). This was higher than when RBV was added (96.6%, 85/88). The conclusion that RBV 
does not add to efficacy in such patients is supported by information from the phase IIb AVIATOR study. 
In  patients  with  genotype  1a  and  compensated  cirrhosis  (treatment  naïve  and  pegIFN+RBV  experienced), 
3DAA+RBV  for  12  weeks  yielded  an  SVR  rate  of  88.6%  (124/140)  (TURQUOISE-II).  When  treatment  was 
extended to 24 weeks, the SVR rate was 94.2% (114/121). The difference between treatment durations was 
apparent in subsets of patients classified as prior null responders to pegIFN/RBV, by those with IL28B non C/C 
genotype and by those with low platelets at baseline. 
In contrast to this, when the same regimen (3DAA+RBV) was given for 12 or 24 weeks was given to patients 
with genotype 1b infection within the same study, there was no apparent impact of treatment duration on the 
probability of SVR, with 98.5% (67/68, one patient relapsing) SVR with 12 weeks and 100% SVR (51/51) with 
24 weeks of therapy. 
In non-cirrhotic treatment naïve patients with genotype 4 infection, the combination of ABT-450(r) + ombitasvir 
+  RBV  for  12  weeks  yielded  an  SVR  rate  of  100%  (42/42).  In  a  similarly  defined  population,  albeit  with 
experience of non-curative treatment with pegIFN+RBV, the same regimen also yielded 100% (49/49) SVR.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
It is unclear what precise subsets of patients with compensated cirrhosis and genotype 1a infection would have 
an equal probability of SVR when given 12 rather than 24 weeks of 3DAA+RBV. 
The magnitude of the incremental effect of adding dasabuvir to ABT-450(r) and ombitasvir in genotype 1b is 
relatively ill defined. 
The efficacy of 2DAA+RBV for 24 weeks in genotype 4 cirrhotics has not been directly studied, but is based on 
bridging from genotype 1b. 
Efficacy in decompensated liver disease has not been studied. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  a  total  of  approximately  2600  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  3DAA+RBV,  the  frequency  of  serious 
adverse events was 2.5% and the frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation was 1%. Most AEs were consistent 
with the previously described side effects profile of RBV (anaemia, hyperbilirubinemia, pruritus, rash, insomnia, 
asthenia). The 3DAA appear to contribute to pruritus. 
Transaminitis  has  been  described  as  an  exposure-dependent  AE  of  ABT-450.  The  general  pattern  of  ALT 
normalisation within a few weeks of therapy when HCV replication is suppressed by a potent antiviral regimen, 
is seen in most treated cases. However, 1% of the treated population experienced an at least grade 3 (≥5xULN) 
ALT  while  on  treatment.  This  frequency  was  higher  in  patients  treated  with  ethinyl  estradiol    containing 
medications (6/23, 26%, five of whom had grade 4 transaminitis). 
Among those few patients that experienced virological failure, treatment emergent resistance to the NS3/4A + 
NS5A  class  was  generally  seen,  and  around  half  the  patients  showed  resistance  also  to  dasabuvir.  In  the 
presence of a resistant viral quasispecies that is detectable with population sequencing and is cross-resistant to 
other  agents,  impaired  retreatment  efficacy  is  anticipated  both  with  the  same  drug(s)  as  well  as  with  cross 
resistant drugs. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The clinical impact of the general emergence of resistance to both the NS3/4A and the NS5A class, as well as in 
many cases to dasabuvir in case of virological failure is an issue surrounded by considerable uncertainty. As 
previously reported, there is some degree of reversion of NS3/4A resistance as selection pressure is removed. 
It is unclear whether retreatment efficacy would still be impaired, e.g., due to “quasispecies memory” after such 
reversion, as well as the extent of such reversion with time. As previously reported, preselected NS5A resistance 
does  not  appear  to  revert.  The  potential  residual  activity  of  NS5A  inhibitors  in  such  patients  is  not  fully 
characterised. 
It is important to consider that in most cases, patients that fail virologically on these very potent regimens are 
likely to be intrinsically difficult to treat. In such cases, the efficacy of any presently conceivable retreatment 
regimen is unclear, as the efficacy of other available and investigational NS3/4A and NS5A inhibitors may be 
compromised.  Also,  interferons  may  have  poor  efficacy  or  be  ill  tolerated  due  to  advanced  liver  disease  or 
significant comorbid conditions. For these reasons, it is difficult to accept submaximal durations or removing

RBV from the regimen, if this is anticipated to lower SVR rates or, as in cirrhotics with more advanced disease, 
be associated with a non-negligible risk of clinical disease progression. Due to these uncertainties, the selection 
of resistance is considered a major safety concern despite the high efficacy of these combination regimens. 
While it is clear that the 3DAA regimen may cause transaminitis (attributable to the paritaprevir component), 
the  extent  to  which  it  may  be  a  cause  of  serious  DILI  with  liver  failure  is  not  fully  clear.  Still,  a  traditional 
assessment of Hy’s law is difficult, as patients generally exhibit mechanistic hyperbilirubinaemia. However, it is 
notable that none of the cases where the 3DAA clearly caused hyperbilirubinaemia and transaminitis progressed 
to liver failure with signs of hepatic synthesis defects; thus available data, given its limitations, are reassuring.  
It is not fully clear whether recommending the stopping algorithm for ALT increases that was used in phase III 
would  be  associated  with  a  positive  or  negative  benefit-risk  balance.  On  the  one  hand,  serious  DILI  might 
theoretically be prevented, though given that only 2 patients stopped therapy due to ALT and that no definite 
cases of 3DAA associated, serious DILI with hepatic dysfunction have been documented, this potential benefit 
remains hypothetical. On the other hand, premature stopping of the antiviral regimen may result in rebound or 
relapse with resistance to NS3/4A and NS5A inhibitors. For these reasons, routine transaminase monitoring is 
not recommended 
While  it  is  highly  likely  that  concomitant  ethinyl  oestradiol  potentiates  the  risk  of  treatment  emergent 
hepatotoxicity, the mechanism of this finding is unclear; notably, it does not appear to be due to a (plasma) 
pharmacokinetic interaction. An interaction study with between ABT-450+ritonavir+dasabuvir on the one hand, 
and  efavirenz  on  the  other,  was  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  ALT  increases.  Available  data  are  not 
supportive of a pharmacokinetic interaction in this case either. Therefore, there is some unclarity on the ability 
of co-medications to impact the potential hepatotoxicity of the DAA combination.  
There are no safety data in patients with HCV and decompensated liver disease.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit-risk of Viekirax is considered positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  general  efficacy  of  the  proposed  regimens  is  excellent  in  genotypes  1b  and  4.  It  is  also  very  good  in 
genotype  1a,  though  RBV  is  needed  and  in  cirrhotics  a  prolongation  of  therapy  to  24  weeks  is  required  for 
optimisation. Furthermore, these regimens are generally very well tolerated, with most symptomatic adverse 
events being due to RBV. The proposed regimens may cause transaminitis; treatment-induced transaminitis 
has,  however,  hitherto  not  been  associated  with  serious  DILI  including  hepatic  failure.  When  used  for  the 
treatment  of  genotypes  1  or-4  in  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease  as  recommended  in  the  product 
information, the benefit-risk balance is positive.

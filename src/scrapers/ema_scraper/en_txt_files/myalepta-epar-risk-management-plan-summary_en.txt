Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Myalepta (metreleptin)solution for 
injection) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Myalepta. The RMP details important risks of 
Myalepta, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Myalepta’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Myalepta’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to HCPs and patients on how Myalepta should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Myalepta should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Myalepta’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Myalepta is authorised as an adjunct to diet as a replacement therapy to treat the complications of 
leptin deficiency in LD patients: 
with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised LD 
(Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above 
with specialist-confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in 
adults and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve 
adequate metabolic control. 
It contains metreleptin as the active substance and it is given by SC injection.  
Further information about the evaluation of Myalepta’s benefits can be found in Myalepta’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/004218/human_
med_002251.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124]. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Myalepta, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Myalepta’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Myalepta, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Myalepta is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Myalepta are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Myalepta. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis, urticaria, and generalised rash) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Non-clinical trials: SC mass/necrosis associated with local 
the medicine 
inflammatory response was noted at the injection site in animals 
receiving FCA. Severe anaphylaxis occurred in all BSA and 
metreleptin 2.5 and 5 mg/mL sensitised groups. 
Clinical trials: hypersensitivity events were reported in 16-27% 
of the patients. Few of the cases were serious. 19 patients had   
hypersensitivity events concurrent with ADAs. 
Post-marketing: 24 cases reporting hypersensitivity–related Aes 
were received from spontaneous sources; anaphylactic reaction 
was reported twice in 1 serious case.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Some drug-related, treatment regimen-related, and patient-
related risk factors (such as age, sex, concurrent illnesses and 
previous reactions to related drugs), have been identified as 
having an important role in drug hypersensitivity (Gomes and 
Demoly 2005). Drug related factors that affect its immunogenicity 
include its ability to act as a hapten, a prohapten or to bind 
covalently to immune receptors. Thus, certain classes of drugs 
tend to be associated with a higher frequency of drug allergies 
compared with others (Thong and Tan 2011). Females appear 
more likely to develop drug allergies than males, but this may be 
attributable to the overall female predominance in ADRs. 
Concomitant disease states may predispose to the development of 
allergic drug reactions by altering metabolic pathways and 
inducing variations in the immunologic responses to drugs. 
Ethnicity and genetics appear to be increasingly important in the 
predisposition to certain types of drug allergy (Thong and Tan 
2011).  
Patients with prior severe hypersensitivity reactions to metreleptin 
or to any of the product components are at higher risk.

activities 
Important identified risk: Acute pancreatitis associated with discontinuation of 
metreleptin  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Clinical trials: A small number of patients experienced

pancreatitis however, all patients had a history of pancreatitis and 
hypertriglyceridaemia and were thus predisposed to pancreatitis 
and all events were deemed unrelated to study treatment.  
Post-marketing experience: Cumulatively through to 
24Jul2016, 16 cases of pancreatitis-related ADRs were received 
from spontaneous sources. Only 4 (of 16) cases were determined 
to potentially represent reports of pancreatitis.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patient with a medical history of pancreatitis and/or severe 
hypertriglyceridaemia, especially those with triglycerides level 
exceeding 500-1000 mg/dL are at higher risk. Cessation of 
treatment will result in elevation of hypertriglyceridaemia and 
hence an increased risk of pancreatitis.

Important identified risk: Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use with Insulin and other 
antidiabetics 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Clinical trials: In Study NIH991265/20010769, hypoglycaemia 
the medicine 
was reported in 10 (15%) of the 66 GL patients. Events were 
drug-related in 8 patients (12%). In the PL subgroup, 
hypoglycaemia was reported in 6 (19%) patients. Events were 
drug-related in 3 (10%). Events were drug-related in 10-12%.  
In Study FHA101, hypoglycaemia was reported in 22% of the GL 
patients and in 43% of the PL subgroup.  
Post-marketing: Cumulative through 24Jul2016, 4 cases 
reporting hypoglycaemia were received from spontaneous sources. 
Concomitant use of insulin and metformin was reported in 2 and 3 
cases, respectively. In all of the cases retrieved, the analysis was 
non-conclusive as other confounding factors were present.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients receiving metreleptin concomitantly with insulin with or 
without an oral antidiabetic drug that causes hypoglycaemia may 
be at increased risk of hypoglycaemia, especially those on high 
dose insulin who have marked improvements in insulin sensitivity 
with metreleptin treatment.

Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Medication errors can be minimised by a comprehensive approach 
that includes the following elements: 
Packaging Design 
 
The package is designed as a compact carton containing 30 vials 
which is equivalent to a month’s supply. 
Educational and Training Activities 
The sponsor will initiate a programme of educational activities for 
prescribers and patients (and their care-givers) containing key 
elements as follows:  
Reminders on key prescribing information  
Responsibility of the prescribing physician to provide appropriate 
training to the patient/care-giver 
Requirement to perform regular follow-ups with the patient/care-
giver to ensure continued correct and compliant Myalepta 
reconstitution and treatment 
Guidance on the appropriate syringe size ancillary administration 
set to prescribe according to the dosage of Myalepta 
Copies of the SmPC and PIL/IFU  
HCPs, patients, and care-givers will also be provided access to 
further materials, including training videos in multiple languages 
that will demonstrate each step to in preparing and administering 
Myalepta.

activities 
Important potential risk: Lymphoma 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Clinical trials: There have been 2 reports of PTCL both of which 
the medicine 
were reported as not related to treatment and 1 cases of ALCL 
which was considered to be related to treatment. All occurred in 
patients with AGL, which is known to be associated with 
autoimmune disease. In the two cases of PTCL, there was 
evidence of pre-existing lymphoma and/or bone 
marrow/haematological abnormalities.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with significant haematologic abnormalities (including 
leukopenia, neutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma, 
and/or lymphadenopathy) and/or patients with acquired forms of 
LD may be at an increased risk. Also patients with diabetes have 
an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
compared with those without diabetes (Mitri, Castillo et al. 2008). 
A meta-analysis showed that (1) patients with diabetes mellitus 
 
type 2 have mild-to-moderate increased odds of developing non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma but not Hodgkin lymphoma; (2) when 
evaluating non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtypes, patients with 
diabetes mellitus type 2 was associated with increased odds of 
PTCL in a small subset analysis.  (Castillo, Mull et al. 2012). 
Gallagher reported a significant association between diabetes and 
the risk for developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Relative risk of 
1.22 (95% CI: 1.07–1.39)) (Gallagher and LeRoith 2013).

Important potential risk: Serious and severe infections secondary to NABs 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Non-clinical trials: Repeated-dose studies in mice showed that 
the medicine 
increases in serum metreleptin concentrations were consistent 
with the development of circulating antibodies. However, the 
results lack clinical relevance since most foreign proteins can elicit 
similar responses. 
Clinical trials: Most patients develop an ADA response to 
metreleptin (96.1%). Nac was observed in 37.3% of the patients 
tested. There were 34 Aes of infection in 16 patients which were 
potentially temporally associated with Nac. Serious and/or severe 
infections that were temporally associated with Nac occurred in 5 
GL patients.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with GL between ≥6 to <18 years were more likely to 
report serious infections (6 patients, 15%), primarily reports of 
sepsis/septic shock/bacteraemia (3 patients) and pneumonia (2 
patients); no adult patients had serious infections.

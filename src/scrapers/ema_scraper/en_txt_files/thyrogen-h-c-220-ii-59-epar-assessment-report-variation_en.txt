2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Thyrogen  contains  thyrotropin  alfa,  a  recombinant  form  of  the  human  Thyroid  Stimulating  Hormone 
(TSH)  with  comparable  biochemical  properties  to  natural  TSH.  Binding  of  thyrotropin  alfa  to  TSH 
receptors  on  thyroid  epithelial  cells  stimulates  iodine  uptake  and  organification,  and  synthesis  and 
release of thyroglobulin (Tg), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). 
Thyrogen  is  indicated  for  use  with  serum  Tg  testing  with  or  without  radioiodine  imaging  for  the 
detection  of  thyroid  remnants  and  well-differentiated  thyroid  cancer  in  post-thyroidectomy  patients 
maintained on thyroid hormone suppression therapy (THST). Low risk patients with well-differentiated 
thyroid carcinoma who have undetectable serum Tg levels on THST and no rhTSH-stimulated increase 
of Tg levels may be followed-up by assaying rhTSH-stimulated Tg levels. 
Thyrogen  is  also  indicated  for  pre-therapeutic  stimulation  in  combination  with  100 mCi  (3.7 GBq) 
radioiodine for ablation of thyroid tissue remnants in patients who have undergone a near-total or total 
thyroidectomy  for  well-differentiated  thyroid  cancer  and  who  do  not  have  evidence  of  distant 
metastatic thyroid cancer. 
The recommended posology is two doses of 0.9 mg thyrotropin alfa administered at a 24-hour interval 
by intramuscular injection only. 
With this variation application, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) proposed to change the 
recommended dose of 131I from 100mCi to the range of 30-100 mCi for the approved remnant ablation 
indication. This request is based on the results of two recently published papers: 
- Mallick U, Harmer C, Yap B, et al. Ablation with low-dose radioiodine and thyrotropin alfa in thyroid 
cancer. N Engl J Med, 2012; 366: 1674-1685 (HiLo study) 
- Schlumberger M, Catargi B, Borget I, et al. Strategies of radioiodine ablation in patients with low-risk 
thyroid cancer. N Engl J Med, 2012; 366: 1663-1673 (ESTIMABL study) 
The variation application was also intended to fulfil FUM 035 which resulted from the approval of 
variation EMEA/H/C/000220/II/0038 (EC Decision date: 20 January 2010) that extended the indication 
for Thyrogen (thyrotropin alpha) to include use of Thyrogen in combination with 100 mCi of radioiodine 
for ablation of thyroid tissue. With FUM 035 the MAH had committed to provide the results of the 
investigator-sponsored study HiLo conducted in the UK, particularly with regard to tumour stage T3 
patient results. 
Consequently, changes to sections 4.1. 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC were proposed. In addition, the 
MAH has also taken the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments, to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 
8.1. Finally, an updated RMP was submitted to reflect PI changes and additional editorial changes were 
made to the RMP. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects  
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Post-surgical thyroid remnant ablation is performed in between 60 and 80% of patients who have 
differentiated thyroid cancer in the U.S. and in Europe. This procedure removes the residual normal 
thyroid tissue, allows radioiodine imaging to be performed at the time of the ablation procedure (which 
could detect unsuspected thyroid tumour), makes subsequent radioiodine scans more informative, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/709596/2012  
Page 3/13
 
 
 
 
lowers the TSH stimulated serum Tg level to allow easier follow-up of patients for tumour recurrences. 
The procedure may also remove residual thyroid tumour cells still present in the patient after surgery. 
For several decades after the first introduction of radioiodine therapy, this first treatment with 131I was 
performed on thyroidectomised patients who were clinically hypothyroid and who had elevated their 
endogenous serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This elevation of serum TSH is 
necessary for radioiodine to be optimally taken up by thyroid cells and covalently bound (organified) to 
protein so that the 131I can remain localised and has an optimal killing effect within the thyroid cells. 
An alternative preparatory method using exogenous injection of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH; 
Thyrogen) was developed during the 1990s. Use of rhTSH allows patients to remain euthyroid (with all 
the associated advantages) and euthyroid state also reduces the radiation exposure to the patient’s 
whole body, blood and bone marrow because when euthyroid, the renal clearance of 131I is greater as 
compared with when the patients are hypothyroid. 
Use of radioiodine for these thyroid cancer patients is generally safe, but the risks and benefits of 
radiation need to be weighed carefully. Because of immediate tissue damage (salivary glands, lacrimal 
glands, bone marrow, gonads, and because of the concern about potential induction of other 
malignancies years after the ablation procedure, many clinicians for years have preferred to adjust the 
amount of radioiodine used based on the seriousness of the patient’s thyroid cancer status.  
Regarding use of Thyrogen for remnant ablation, although there was appropriate evidence of efficacy 
for Thyrogen when used with 100 mCi 131I (3.7 GBq), there were only limited data available when used 
with 30 mCi (1.1 GBq) and different studies gave different results. 
In the United Kingdom, 2007 guidelines recommend the use of high-dose radioiodine. Guidelines of the 
U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010), the American Thyroid Association (2009) and a 
European consensus report (2006) indicate that clinicians can choose between the low dose and the 
high dose. However, reliable evidence was lacking. 
2.2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
The applicant has provided the results of two recently published large, prospective randomised trials 
with 2x2 factorial designs which specifically address the issue of dose of radiation used in remnant 
ablation, comparing the currently approved 100mCi (3.7GBq) with the lower 30mCi (1.1GBq). In 
addition, one of the two studies (Mallick, 2012, N Engl J Med) enrolled a patient population that 
provides insight into remnant ablation in patients originally diagnosed with primary tumours classed as 
T3 (TNM staging system, 6th edition). 
HiLo Study 
The HiLo study (Mallick et al, 2012) was a randomised non-inferiority trial comparing low-dose and 
high-dose radioiodine, each in combination with either thyrotropin alpha or thyroid hormone 
withdrawal before ablation, performed in the UK in 438 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.  
The patients, aged between 16 and 80 years, were tumour stage pT1-T3, with possible spread to 
nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis, Nx, N0 or N1, and M0 (TNM 6th edition). They had 
undergone total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node dissection.  
Patients were randomised to one of four arms: 30 mCi or 100 mCi, each with either rhTSH or 
withdrawal of thyroid hormone as preparation.  
Ablation success was determined 6 to 9 months later by using 131I diagnostic scanning, and by 
measurement of stimulated serum Tg levels (using withdrawal of thyroid hormone in 140 cases, and 
Thyrogen in the rest). Ablation success was based on a diagnostic scan thyroid bed uptake of <0.1% of 
Assessment report

the administered activity of 131I, and stimulated serum Tg <2.0 ng/mL. The study was sized assuming 
an 80% success rate for the 100 mCi regimens, and treatments were to be judged comparable if the 
ablation success rates fell within a maximum allowable difference of 10 percentage points.  
Recruitment occurred at 29 centres from 2007 to 2010. The median patient age was 44 years, and 
about 80% of the patients were female. In total, 23% of the patients were T3 and 16% were N1. Data 
could be analysed for 421 patients. Of these, 207 patients received high dose radioiodine (105 had 
thyroid hormone withdrawal and 102 received Thyrogen) and 214 patients received low dose 
radioiodine (106 had thyroid hormone withdrawal and 108 received Thyrogen). 
Ablation success rates at 6 to 9 months for the four subgroups of the study are summarised in the 
following Table 1.

Ablation success rates were 85.0% in the group receiving 30 mCi versus 88.9% in the group receiving 
100 mCi. The group that was prepared using rhTSH had a success rate of 87.1%, whereas patients 
prepared using thyroid hormone withdrawal had a success rate of 86.7%. All 95% confidence intervals 
for the differences among groups were within ± 10%, indicating non-inferiority. Similar results were 
found when looking at the subgroups (using the pre-defined comparisons); the success rate for rhTSH 
+ 30 mCi was 84.3%, for rhTSH + 100 mCi it was 90.2%, and for thyroid hormone withdrawal + 100 
mCi it was 87.6%.  
There was no evidence of an interaction between radioiodine dose and method of preparation 
(thyrotropin alpha or thyroid hormone withdrawal) on success rates (P = 0.51). 
Regarding other important subgroups, analyses of the T3 patients (n = 101) and of patients with neck 
lymph nodes thought to harbour tumour (n = 70) found that they were successfully ablated with 
similar rates to other patients. For example, when T3 patients were assessed for ablation success using 
diagnostic scans alone, the success rates using 30 mCi and 100 mCi were 93.6% and 89.8%, 
respectively. If both the diagnostic scan and the stimulated Tg level were to be favourable to count for 
success, then for T3 patients the success rates using 30 mCi and 100 mCi were 80.9% and 81.6%, 
respectively. If both the diagnostic scan and the stimulated Tg were to be favourable to count for 
success, then for patients who were both T3 and N1, the success rates using 30 mCi and 100 mCi were 
77.8% and 75.0%, respectively. For T3 patients treated with rhTSH versus thyroid hormone 
withdrawal, the ablation success rates as assessed by scans alone were 89.6% versus 93.8%, 
respectively. If both the scan and stimulated Tg had to be favourable to count as success, then the 
success rates for T3 patients treated with rhTSH versus thyroid hormone withdrawal were 83.3% 
versus 79.2%, respectively.  
Logistic-regression analyses indicated that success rates did not differ significantly between the low 
dose and the high dose on the basis of either tumour stage (P = 0.71 for interaction) or nodal stage (P 
= 0.27 for interaction). 
ESTIMABL Study 
The ESTIMABL study (Essai Stimulation Ablation Equivalence Trial; Schlumberger et al, 2012) was 
performed in 24 French centres and compared the same four strategies for thyroid remnant ablation as 
evaluated in HiLo. Patients in ESTIMABL were, however, TNM stage pT1< 1 cm with N1, or pT1> 1 - 2 
cm with either N0 or 1, or pT2 with N0, and for all these patient types there could not be any distant 
metastases present. Thus, there were no T3 patients included.  
684 of the 752 patients enrolled had data that could be evaluated. 79% of patients were female, the 
mean age was 49 years, and 92% had papillary cancer. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of ablation at 8 ± 2 months post-radioiodine therapy, using the 
assessments of neck ultrasound and rhTSH-stimulated Tg determination (or 131I whole-body scan in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/709596/2012  
Page 6/13
 
 
 
 
 
the presence of Tg antibodies). 
Patient types were as follows: 30% were pT1N0, 18% were pT1N1, 39% were pT1Nx, and 12% were 
pT2 N0. In the 684 patients with data at about 8 months that could be evaluated, ultrasonography of 
the neck showed no thyroid remnant or suspicious neck nodes in 652 (95%), and the rhTSH-
stimulated serum Tg level was < 1 ng/mL in 621 of the 652 patients without detectable Tg antibodies. 
It should be noted that the stimulated Tg cut-off level that defined success was set slightly lower in the 
French study than in the UK study. 
On the basis of the local thyroglobulin determinations, thyroid ablation was judged to be complete in 
631 (92%) of the 684 patients. All four treatment arms of the study had very similar ablation rates. 
For the four groups rhTSH + 30 mCi, rhTSH + 100 mCi, thyroid hormone withdrawal + 30 mCi, and 
thyroid hormone withdrawal + 100 mCi, the rates of ablation success as judged by neck ultrasound 
were 97%, 94%, 96% and 95%, respectively, whereas if one judged success by central laboratory 
stimulated Tg determination the rates of success were 90%, 94%, 93%, and 93%, respectively. 
Statistically, the four treatments had comparable efficacy. 
Equivalence was also shown between the two 131I doses used. There was no interaction between 131I 
radioactivity and thyrotropin- stimulation method. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
These two well conducted studies, published in a peer reviewed journal, provide appropriate assurance 
regarding the safety and efficacy of use of lower doses of radioiodine.  
There were slight differences in the patients recruited, and in the conduct of the studies, but the basic 
study designs were the same. The Schlumberger study included only “low risk” patients but the Mallick 
study included patient with tumour stages T1 to T3, with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but 
without metastases. 
The Mallick study showed that 30 mCi could be used just as successfully for remnant ablation as 
100 mCi, and this also was true in subgroups based on T and N stage. Patients benefited from use of 
rhTSH, which allowed them to continue thyroid hormone replacement during the ablation procedure, 
and thereby avoid significant hypothyroidism. 
The authors suggested that ‘the efficacy of low-dose radioiodine is similar to that of high-dose 
radioiodine and that the efficacy of low-dose radioiodine ablation is not compromised by the use of 
thyrotropin alpha instead of thyroid hormone withdrawal’. 
The Schlumberger study similarly showed similar efficacy with high and low dose radioiodine and 
similar efficacy of thyroid radioablation after preparation with use of either recombinant human 
thyrotropin or by withholding of thyroid hormone (assessment of ablation was at 8 months). 
In comments about their high ablation rates, the authors suggest three reasons: ‘First, a total 
thyroidectomy was performed in all patients, resulting in small remnants of normal thyroid tissue, as 
shown by the low uptake of 131I on total-body scan and the low serum thyroglobulin levels at 131I 
administration. Second, our patients had low-risk disease, with small T1 or T2 thyroid tumours, with no 
extension beyond the thyroid capsule and no aggressive histologic subtypes. Third, we did not consider 
the faint uptake in the thyroid bed that is frequently found on control diagnostic 131I total-body scans 
and that has no clinical importance’. 
The authors concluded that, ‘The use of recombinant human thyrotropin and low-dose (1.1 GBq) 
postoperative radioiodine ablation may be sufficient for the management of low-risk thyroid cancer’. 
In the Mallick study, the authors pointed out that their findings relate to 6 and 9 month only and that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/709596/2012  
Page 7/13
 
 
 
 
long term follow up will be required to examine recurrence rates. In essence, there are no significant 
long-term data, as the follow up periods in the study were in line with treatment guidelines and current 
practices for thyroid cancer. Similarly, in the Schlumberger study, the authors note that ‘Whether 
preparation with recombinant human thyrotropin followed by 1.1-GBq 131I radioactivity affects long-
term outcomes will be revealed only by following patients over time. However, the currently available 
data are reassuring in showing that less than 1% of patients with low-risk cancer who had normal neck 
ultrasonography and an undetectable thyrotropin-stimulated serum thyroglobulin level will have a 
clinical recurrence over a 10-to-15-year period’. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, these two studies provide convincing evidence that supports the proposed SmPC 
changes. Unless long-term data on recurrence rates using the lower radioiodine dose become 
available, this lack of information should be described in the SmPC (sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Long term data from published investigator sponsored studies studies HiLo and ESTIMABL should be 
provided when made available. 
2.2.5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
In the HiLo study, the proportions of patients with adverse events during ablation and up to 1 week 
after the procedure were 21% in the 30 mCi group versus 33% in the 100 mCi group (P=0.007). There 
was a trend toward fewer adverse events in the rhTSH group (23%) versus in the group undergoing 
thyroid hormone withdrawal (30%; P=0.11), but there were clear quality of life benefits associated 
with use of rhTSH before ablation. Moreover, patients who had received 100 mCi were more commonly 
hospitalised for 3 days than were patients who had received 30 mCi (36.3% vs. 13.0%, P<0.001). 
In the ESTIMABL study, symptoms of hypothyroidism and SF-36-documented deterioration of quality 
of life were worse for patients undergoing withdrawal of thyroid hormone than for patients who 
received rhTSH. The incidence of salivary problems did not differ significantly among the groups, but 
lacrimal dysfunction (watery eyes) was more frequent among patients undergoing thyroid hormone 
withdrawal than among patients receiving rhTSH.  
In conclusion, symptoms of hypothyroidism occurred in those treated with thyroid withdrawal. No new 
safety issues in relation to Thyrogen arose in either of the studies. 
2.3.  Risk management plan 
The EU Risk Management Plan (EU-RMP) has been revised to reflect the proposed changes to the 
SmPC; the important missing information sections of the Safety Specification and Pharmacovigilance 
Plans have been updated based on the publications mentioned above. Additional changes have been 
made to render the document up-to-date.

infiltrating the neck, may experience local oedema or focal 
haemorrhage at the site of these metastases resulting in increased 
tumour size. This may lead to acute symptoms, which depend on 
the anatomical location of the tissue e.g. hemiplegia, 
hemiparesis, loss of vision have occurred in patients with CNS 
metastases. Laryngeal oedema, respiratory distress requiring 
tracheotomy, and pain at the site of metastasis have also been 
reported after Thyrogen administration. It is recommended that 
pre-treatment with corticosteroids be considered for patients in 
whom local tumour expansion may compromise vital anatomic 
structures. 
Section 4.8 (undesirable effects) SmPC (Annex 2), includes the 
following text, in line with text in Section 4.4: 
Enlargement of residual thyroid tissue or metastases can occur 
following treatment with Thyrogen. This may lead to acute 
symptoms, which depend on the anatomical location of the 
tissue. For example, hemiplegia, hemiparesis or loss of vision 
have occurred in patients with CNS metastases. Laryngeal 
oedema, respiratory distress requiring tracheotomy, and pain at 
the site of metastasis have also been reported after Thyrogen 
administration. It is recommended that pre-treatment with 
corticosteroids be considered for patients in whom local tumour 
expansion may compromise vital anatomic structures. 
A separate cumulative analysis of cases reporting thyroid 
swelling will be provided in the next PSUR.

Section 4.2 (Posology and Method of Administration) SmPC 
(Annex 2) derived from the CCSI (Annex 7): 
Information from post marketing surveillance, as well as 
published information, suggests that elimination of Thyrogen is 
significantly slower in dialysis-dependent end stage renal 
disease (ESRD) patients, resulting in prolonged elevation of 
TSH levels for several days after treatment. This may lead to 
increased risk of headache and nausea. There are no studies of 
alternative dose schedules of Thyrogen in patients with ESRD to 
guide dose reduction in this population.  
In patients with significant renal impairment the activity of 
radioiodine should be carefully selected by the nuclear medicine 
physician. 
Section 4.2 (Posology and Method of Administration) SmPC 
(Annex 2) derived from the CCSI (Annex 7): 
The recommended dose regimen is two doses of 0.9 mg 
thyrotropin alpha administered at a 24-hour interval by 
intramuscular injection only.  
Therapy should be supervised by physicians with expertise in 
thyroid cancer. 
A separate review of medication errors during the reporting 
period of the next PSUR will be provided in the next PSUR 
Section 4.4 (Special Warnings and Precautions for Use) SmPC 
(Annex 2) derived from the CCSI (Annex 7): 
There is a theoretical possibility that Thyrogen, like thyroid 
hormone withdrawal, may lead to stimulated tumour growth.  In 
clinical trials with thyrotropin alpha, which produces a short-
term increase in serum TSH levels, no case of tumour growth 
has been reported 
Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) SmPC 
(Annex 2) derived from the CCSI (Annex 7): 
Careful evaluation of benefit-risk relationships should be 
assessed for Thyrogen administration in high risk elderly 
patients who have heart disease (e.g. valvular heart disease, 
cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and prior or current 
tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation) and have not 
undergone thyroidectomy. 
Thyrogen is known to cause a transient but significant rise in 
serum thyroid hormone concentration when given to patients 
who have substantial thyroid tissue still in situ.  Therefore, 
careful evaluation of individual risk-benefit is necessary for 
patients with significant residual thyroid tissue. 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) SmPC (Annex 2) derived from 
the CCSI (Annex 7): 
Very rare cases of hyperthyroidism or atrial fibrillation have 
been observed when Thyrogen 0.9 mg has been administered in 
patients with presence of either partial or entire thyroid gland. 
A separate cumulative analysis of cases reporting cardiovascular 
adverse reactions will be provided in the next PSUR. 
The next PSUR will include an evaluation of all cases which are 
potentially associated with off-label use, tracked by searching by 
indication as well as alternate dosages of Thyrogen used (i.e., 
lower doses used for the goitre indication).

(Annex 2) derived from the CCSI (Annex 7): 
For radioiodine imaging or ablation, radioiodine administration 
should be given 24 hours following the final Thyrogen injection. 
Diagnostic scintigraphy should be performed 48 to 72 hours 
following radioiodine administration, whereas post-ablation 
scintigraphy may be delayed additional days to allow 
background activity to decline. 
For diagnostic follow-up serum thyroglobulin (Tg) testing, the 
serum sample should be obtained 72 hours after the final 
injection of Thyrogen.

Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) SmPC (Annex 2) derived from 
the CCSI (Annex 7): 
In clinical trials involving 481 patients, no patients have 
developed antibodies to thyrotropin alpha either after single or 
repeated limited (27 patients) use of the product.  The 
occurrence of antibodies which could interfere with endogenous 
TSH assays cannot be excluded.

Section 4.6 (Pregnancy and Lactation) SmPC (Annex 2) derived

It is not known whether Thyrogen can cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman or whether Thyrogen can 
affect reproductive capacity.  
Thyrogen in combination with diagnostic radioiodine whole 
body scintigraphy is contra-indicated in pregnancy, because of 
the consequent exposure of the foetus to a high dose of 
radioactive material. Patients should not breast-feed.  
Section 4.2 (Posology) SmPC (Annex 2) derived from the CCSI 
(Annex 7): 
Due to a lack of data on the use of Thyrogen in children, 
Thyrogen should be given to children only in exceptional 
circumstances 
Section 4.1 (therapeutic indication) SmPC (Annex 2) 
Use of Thyrogen for remnant ablation is restricted to 
combination with 100 mCi radioiodine only. 
Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use SmPC) 
(Annex 2) 
In the pivotal trial of Thyrogen for pre-therapeutic stimulation 
before radioiodine (131I) ablation of thyroid tissue remnants in 
patients who have undergone a near-total or total thyroidectomy 
for well-differentiated thyroid cancer, an activity of 100 mCi 
(3.7 GBq) radioactive iodine (131I) was used. Experience of 
rhTSH in combination with other radioiodine activities, in 
particular as low as 1 GBq is very limited. The efficacy of 
rhTSH for thyroid remnant ablation in combination with low 
radioiodine activities has not been demonstrated.

Update the SmPC Section 4.8 under “Undesirable Effects” to 
include: 
“Very rare cases of stroke have been reported from world-wide 
post marketing experience in female patients.  The relationship 
to Thyrogen administration is unknown.” 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no new pharmacovigilance 
activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the 
product. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH has proposed the update of the section 4.1 and a number of related amendments to the 
SmPC to allow the use of lower doses of radioiodine in thyroid ablation. In principle, the use of a 
reduced dose of radioiodine has important advantages. Patients, many of whom are women with 
children, would spend less time in hospital isolation and have fewer side effects, especially a reduced 
risk of a second primary cancer caused by exposure to radioactive substances. 
In the United Kingdom, 2007 guidelines recommend the use of high-dose radioiodine. Guidelines of the 
U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010), the American Thyroid Association (2009), and a 
European consensus report (2006) indicate that clinicians can choose between the low dose and the 
high dose.  However, reliable evidence was lacking. 
When the indication for use of Thyrogen for remnant ablation was granted, there was evidence of 
appropriate efficacy for Thyrogen when used with 100 mCi 131I (3.7 GBq), but only limited data when 
used with 30 mCi (1.1 GBq) were available. Several relevant publications were inadequate to provide 
convincing evidence of efficacy. 
The recent publication in New England Journal of Medicine of two clinical trials in which use of 30 mCi 
(1.1 GBq) was compared with use of 100 mCi (3.7GBq) for remnant ablation (preparatory methods of 
Thyrogen versus thyroid hormone withdrawal also were tested using a 2 x 2 factorial design within a 
Assessment report

non-inferiority structure) now provides better evidence of similar efficacy when Thyrogen is used with 
30 mCi (Mallick, 2012, N Engl J Med; Schlumberger, 2012, N Engl J Med). 
These two, well performed, randomised, prospective studies compared both high and low dose 
radioiodine and also the two possible strategies for preparation of patients for radioiodine 
administration. The Schlumberger study included only “low risk” patients but the Mallick study included 
patient with tumour stages T1 to T3, with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without 
metastases. 
The Mallick study concluded that the study had shown that the efficacy of low dose radioiodine was 
similar to that of high dose radioiodine. Moreover, adverse events were higher and hospitalisations 
were longer with the higher radioiodine dose, while quality of life was better with the use of 
recombinant human thyrotropin than with thyroid hormone withdrawal. The authors point out that 
findings relate to 6 and 9 month only and long term follow up will be required to examine recurrence 
rates. 
The Schlumberger study similarly showed similar efficacy and safety with high and low dose 
radioiodine and similar efficacy of thyroid radioablation after preparation with use of either 
recombinant human thyrotropin or by withholding of thyroid hormone (assessment of ablation was at 8 
months), while, as expected, safety was better with recombinant human thyrotropin than with thyroid 
hormone withdrawal. 
These two studies provide convincing evidence that supports the agreed SmPC changes. The benefit- 
risk of Thyrogen when used with a range of 131I dose between 30 mCi (1.1 GBg) and 100 mCi (3.7 
GBq) for ablation of thyroid tissue remnants in patients who have undergone a near-total or total 
thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid cancer and who do not have evidence of distant 
metastatic thyroid cancer, is considered positive. 
Moreover, FUM 035 can be considered fulfilled. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Update of section 4.1 of the SmPC in order to recommend the use of Thyrogen with a range of 30-100 
mCi 131I for postoperative thyroid remnant ablation, as opposed to the currently approved 100 mCi 
131I, based on the results of two published studies (HiLo and ESTIMABL). Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 are 
updated accordingly to amend relevant existing warnings and to include information from the two 
studies.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments in the SmPC and to 
update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.1. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet.

Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The applicant submitted to the EMEA on 5 January 1996 an application for Hycamtin powder 
for solution for infusion. The procedure started on 16 January 1996. 
During the February 1996 CPMP meeting, an inspection of the Finished Product Manufacturing 
Site in the USA was agreed upon to be carried out by the British and Swedish Inspectorates. 
The  Co-Rapporteur's  initial  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on 
8 March 1996. The Rapporteur's initial assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members 
on 11 March 1996. 
During the meeting on 21 May 1996 the CPMP agreed the consolidated list of questions to be 
sent to the company.  
The final consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 22 May 1996. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 3 June 1996. 
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur circulated the comments on the company’s responses to the 
list of questions to all CPMP Members on 17 June 1996. 
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur circulated amendments to the assessment of the responses 
of quality related issues dated 17 June 1996 to all CPMP Members on 16 July 1996. 
The  company  provided  additional  information  on  16  July  1996,  which  addressed  two  clinical 
issues (the high initial death rate in the topotecan arm of the paclitaxel comparative trial 039 and 
a justification of a Marketing Authorisation in light of the significant toxicity). This resulted in 
amendments of the SPC, the package leaflet and the labelling. 
The  company  submitted  a  letter  of  obligations  on  16  July  1996,  where  they  agree  to  provide 
additional information concerning chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects. 
The CPMP during their meeting on 16-17 July 1996, on the basis of the acceptable benefit-risk 
assessment,  issued  a  positive  Opinion  for  granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  to  Hycamtin 
powder  for  solution  for  infusion  on  17  July  1996.  The  CPMP  Opinion  was  forwarded,  in  all 
official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the  European  Commission,  which  adopted  the 
corresponding Decision on 12 November 1996.

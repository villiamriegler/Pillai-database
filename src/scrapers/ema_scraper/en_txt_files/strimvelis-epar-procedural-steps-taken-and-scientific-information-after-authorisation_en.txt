are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This variation discusses the final study results of the post-
“Evaluation of referring healthcare providers’ and 
parents’/carers’ understanding of specific risks 
associated with Strimvelis treatment” listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. The RMP version 6.1 
has also been submitted. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
authorisation study: ”Evaluation of referring Healthcare 
Providers’ and parents’/carers’ understanding of specific 
risks associated with Strimvelis treatment’’ (STRIM-001). 
The study demonstrated that the routine and additional 
RMMs were effective in informing the HCPs and 
parents/carers about most of the risks associated with 
Strimvelis treatment and that the outcome of study STRIM-
001 does not change the current risk-benefit conclusions 
for Strimvelis. The RMP was updated to reflect the 
completion of this study.

SmPC, Annex 
Patients treated with Strimvelis gene therapy continued to 
II, Labelling 
demonstrate stable efficacy, as evidenced by sustained 
and PL 
engraftment of gene modified cells, the maintenance of 
purine metabolite levels at non-pathological levels, robust 
immune reconstitution, and significantly fewer severe 
infections over time. However, a case of Lymphoid T cell 
leukemia has been reported in a patient with ADA-SCID 4.7 
years after treatment with Strimvelis. This first case of a 
hematological malignancy following treatment with 
Strimvelis is considered to be due to insertional 
oncogenesis. 
Patients should therefore be monitored long term, with at 
least annual visits for the first 11 years and then at 13- and 
15-years post treatment with Strimvelis and include a 
complete blood count with differential, biochemistry and 
thyroid stimulating hormone. 
Despite this event, the Committee agreed that the overall 
100 % survival and high rate of intervention free survival 
encompasses significant and clinically relevant benefit for 
patients with ADA-SCID for whom no suitable matched 
related stem cell donor is available. 
Page 3/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the Committee considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Strimvelis in the approved indication remains favourable 
but considered that this recent safety signal should be 
closely monitored and, therefore, an additional renewal is 
recommended to further evaluate the benefit risk balance 
of this product.

This variation provides the final results of the STRIM-004 
to update the safety information following the 
completion of the STRIM-004 study, which is a non-
interventional long term follow up of the subjects 
who received Strimvelis gene therapy. This study 
included paediatric patients and is listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 3.0 has also 
been submitted. In addition, the Marketing

Strimvelis gene therapy in four studies previously assessed

follow-up data in 16 patients previously treated with 
Strimvelis. Overall survival remains at 100%. Subjects 
treated with Strimvelis gene therapy continued to

Strimvelis is in line with that expected in an ADA-SCID 
population which has undergone busulfan conditioning and 
is undergoing immune reconstitution. No new safety 
findings have been identified.  
As a result of this variation, the frequency of smooth

Through this variation application, the MAH is proposing the 
to introduce changes to the design of the post-
authorisation study STRIM-002, from a prospective 
to a retrospective study. 
Following additional minor changes to the RMP are 
also included: Update of the RMP in line with EMA 
Rev.2.0.1 template; update of the RMP to make the 
necessary amendments to the name of the MAH 
following the MAH transfer; update of the data in the

to a retrospective analysis of samples previously collected 
from Strimvelis-treated patients.   
This proposal to change the retroviral insertion sites 
analysis is considered acceptable, as the quality of the data 
obtained should be similar by using a retrospective analysis 
instead of a prospective one, assuming that enough stored 
samples are suitable for testing. In addition, as the MAH

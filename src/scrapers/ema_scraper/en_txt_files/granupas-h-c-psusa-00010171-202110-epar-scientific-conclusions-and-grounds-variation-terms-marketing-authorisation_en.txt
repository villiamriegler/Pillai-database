Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for para-aminosalicylic acid (centrally 
authorised product), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on the literature (Parvez et al.) including a study reporting that the para-
aminosalicylic acid-calcium formulation significantly reduced systemic exposure to tenofovir, it is 
considered that such information may be important to prescribers since the data appears to be of 
reasonable quality with an acceptable cross-over design, and the effect size is very large. In addition, 
there is no obvious reason why another salt form than that approved would drastically change the 
interaction potential. Therefore, it is concluded that the product information of products containing para-
aminosalicylic acid (centrally authorised product) should be amended accordingly.   
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for para-aminosalicylic acid (centrally authorised product) the 
CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing para-
aminosalicylic acid (centrally authorised product) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the 
product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

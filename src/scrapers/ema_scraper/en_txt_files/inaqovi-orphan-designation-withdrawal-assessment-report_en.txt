2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2021 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the 
following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing cedazuridine, decitabine 
was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing responses in de novo or 
secondary acute myeloid leukaemia; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of the bone 
marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation and the risk of severe infections. The condition progresses rapidly and is 
fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1.7 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing cedazuridine, decitabine will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data which demonstrate similar efficacy with currently 
approved therapies for AML patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The oral 
fixed-dose combination might reduce the burden of parenteral therapies. 
The Committee considered that this constitutes a major contribution to patient care. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are cumulatively fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends 
the designation of this medicinal product, containing cedazuridine, decitabine as an orphan medicinal 
product for the orphan condition: treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia”.

3.  Review of criteria fo r orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) includes a heterogeneous group of neoplastic disorders characterized 
by the proliferation and accumulation of immature haematopoietic cells of the myeloid line. The 
disease is associated with termination in cellular differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation of clonal 
immature malignant myeloblasts, which results in a deficiency of red blood cells, normal white blood 
cells, and platelets. AML mainly affects adults, with the median age at diagnosis of 70 years and an 
increasing incidence with age. The clinical presentation of AML is directly related to ineffective 
haematopoiesis; patients typically present with signs and symptoms of fatigue, haemorrhage, as well 
as infections and fever. Furthermore, the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant blasts results in the 
accumulation of a large number of abnormal, immature myeloblasts in the bone marrow (BM), 
peripheral blood, and in various organs such as the central nervous system, lymph nodes, skin, liver 
and spleen. If untreated, AML progresses rapidly and is fatal in weeks to months. Patients die due to 
infection, bleeding, or complications related to a large volume of abnormal cells in the vasculature.      
AML can be divided into de novo and secondary disease (Scheinberg et al, 2001; Appelbaum et al, 
2001). Patients presenting with de novo AML often do not have any identifiable risk factor. Secondary 
causes for AML include previous myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), Down’s syndrome, Fanconi’s 
anaemia, ataxia-telangiectasia, long-term treatment consequences of certain chemotherapeutic 
agents, and exposure to environmental hazards (e.g., benzene). The common feature of all AML is 
genetic mutation, which results in visible cytogenetic abnormalities in 70% of the patients when the 
leukaemia cells are karyotyped. As a result, various genes are increased or decreased in expression, 
resulting in the neoplastic state of the disease. 
The target patient population of the proposed medicinal product is adult patients with newly diagnosed 
AML who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy. 
The proposed product, Inaqovi is a fixed-dose combination tablet for oral administration, containing 35 
mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine. Cedazuridine, is a cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor. It is a 
new chemical entity without antineoplastic activity but allowing oral administration of decitabine 
instead of iv.  Decitabine is a known substance, previously approved at a dose of 20 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 consecutive days (i.e., a total of 5 doses per 
treatment cycle).  
The currently applied therapeutic indication “Inaqovi is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for standard 
induction chemotherapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of acute 
myeloid leukaemia”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP.

Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
According to the sponsor, no significant changes have been identified in the seriousness of AML since 
the orphan designation was granted in 2021.  
AML remains a life threatening and chronically debilitating condition due to the consequences of the 
bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation and the risk of severe infections (Döhner 2022; Khwaja 2016).  
AML progresses rapidly and is fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated (Short 
2018).  For most adult patients, AML is incurable (Newell 2021); although, in some paediatric AML 
subsets cure rates of up to 70% are achievable (Short 2018).  AML had the shortest survival of all 
adult leukaemias; 5-year survival was only 24% (Shallis 2019).  Relapsed disease and the leukaemia-
associated complications are the most common causes of death in all age groups (Short 2018). Most 
patients with AML continue to die of their disease or its disease related complications, usually within 6-
18 months of diagnosis. 
The COMP considers the condition to be both, life threatening and chronically debilitating, due to the 
consequences of bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic 
episodes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition 
progresses rapidly and is fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor proposed a prevalence of 1.3 in 10,000 persons. This was based on the most recently 
available cancer registry data from countries across the EU/EAA.  The sponsor included the per-country 
prevalence directly reported by a registry if this was obviously complete prevalence. In some cases, 
these data are reported as "prevalence" (RARECARENet 13.6 and Czech registry 10.4) or "total 
prevalence" (NORDCAN 18.8).  In these cases, it was assumed to be "complete prevalence" for the 
respective country/region. For the Netherlands, long-landmark (20-year) prevalence is reported which 
is assumed to approximate to complete prevalence of patients with uncured AML.  Since the median 
age at diagnosis of AML is approximately 70 years, whilst the median age at death of an average 
EU/EEA citizen is on the order of 80 years (Eurostat 2022), a 10-year partial prevalence of AML as 
reported in some registry data (Belgium 14.0; the Netherlands 12.6; NORDCAN 10.1) may be closest 
to the true prevalence of AML.  Whereas total/20-year prevalence as reported by the Netherlands and 
NORDCAN registries (and potentially RARECARENet and the Czech registry) may reflect to some extent 
an accumulation over time of surviving cured patients. However, since the proportion of cured patients 
is unknown in any of the registry data, a conservative approach was adopted, using the longest 
reported landmark prevalence from the Netherlands as the estimated complete prevalence for that 
country in the calculation of the complete prevalence of AML in the EU/EEA. 
Where only incidence and landmark survival rates (generally 5-year) are reported by a registry, the 
sponsor used these data to derive an estimated country-specific total prevalence using two different 
methods. The first one was based on the standard formula P= I × D from reported incidence and 
average disease duration derived from Dutch (3.9 years) or NORDCAN (5.7 years). For the second 
method, the sponsor assumed that the survival curves in each country are essentially of the same 
shape, and only moved up or down relative to each other based on differences in annual incidence. 
This scaling approach based on a single data point (5-year relative survival) can only ever be an 
approximate. Based on the above, the reported and calculated complete prevalence (per 100,000 
persons) of AML from EU/EEA country registries are presented in Table 1. (all incidence and prevalence 
data below are presented as per 100,000 persons unless otherwise specified).

The COMP agreed with the proposed prevalence of 1.3 per 10,000 persons which is in line with 
previous opinions. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
For newly diagnosed AML patients who are not eligible to intensive induction chemotherapy, the 
authorised therapies in the EU include: the hypomethylating agents (HMAs) Dacogen (decitabine) and 
Vidaza (azacytidine), Venclyxto (venetoclax + azacitidine or decitabine), Daurismo (glasdegib + low-
dose cytarabine [LDAC]) and Tibsovo (ivosidenib).   
The sponsor also refers to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice 
guidelines and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations (Döhner et al. 2022, Heuser et al. 
2020). The standard treatment strategy for patients with newly diagnosed AML includes either 
intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy or non-intensive treatment.  The choice between 
intensive and non-intensive approaches is largely determined by considerations of a patient's fitness to 
tolerate the intensive approach.  Therapy for patients in complete remission consists of either 
consolidation chemotherapy, or autologous or allogeneic HSCT (alloHSCT).  In both the ESMO and ELN 
guidelines, patients are still encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible. 
The target patient population of Inaqovi consists of newly diagnosed AML patients who are ineligible for 
standard induction chemotherapy. Table 2 below includes the medicinal products authorized in EU for 
the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who are not eligible (unfit) for standard induction

chemotherapy. Based on the indication, Vidaza, Dacogen, Venxlycto and Daurismo as considered as 
satisfactory methods because there is a complete overlap with the indications.  
Since Tibsovo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who are not 
eligible to receive standard induction chemotherapy but with a specific mutation isocitrate 
dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) R132 mutation the target population covered by Inaqovi is broader therefore 
Tibsovo is not considered as satisfactory method.

Significant benefit 
The sponsor claimed the significant benefit of Inaqovi, versus the medicinal products considered as 
satisfactory methods for newly diagnosed AML patients who are not eligible to intensive induction 
chemotherapy, based on the major contribution to patient care. This is due to orally administered HMA 
and also argued with indirect comparisons versus the satisfactory methods described above. 
In summary, the primary data supporting the efficacy of Inaqovi in newly diagnosed AML in the 
marketing authorization application were obtained from a phase 3 (ASTX727-02-EU) open-label, 
randomised, 2-cycle, 2-sequence crossover study that included adult patients with de novo or 
secondary AML as defined by World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria, who were not candidates for 
standard induction chemotherapy. A total of 89 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive Inaqovi (35 
mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine) orally in cycle 1 and decitabine (20 mg/m2) intravenously 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000141337 
Page 8/20 
 
 
 
 
(IV) in cycle 2 (n=44) or the reverse sequence (n=45). Both Inaqovi and intravenous decitabine were 
administered once daily on days 1 through 5 of the 28-day cycle. Starting with cycle 3, all patients 
received Inaqovi orally once daily on days 1 through 5 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression, 
death, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary outcome measure of the phase 3 study was 5-day 
cumulative decitabine AUC between Inaqovi and IV decitabine. Inaqovi achieved AUC0-24hr exposures 
equivalent to intravenous infusion of decitabine at 20 mg/m2. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 
complete response (CR) and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion 
independence. 
ASTX727 demonstrated equivalent decitabine pharmacokinetic (PK) to IV decitabine 20 mg/m2 when 
both were administered over 5 days.  
After a median follow-up of 7.95 months, the CR rate in patients receiving ASTX727 was 21.8% (95% 
CI 13.7, 32.0), the median duration of CR was 5.8 months (95% CI 3.3, not estimate) and the median 
time to first response was 2.87 months (min, max: 1.8, 7.4).  
Median duration of treatment (data cut-off date 10 September 2021) was 4.86 months (range 0 to 18 
months), with 37.5% of subjects treated for >6 months and 6.3% of subjects treated for >12 months. 
•  Major contribution to patient care 
Treating the elderly unfit AML patient population 
The sponsor claimed that  AML is largely, but not exclusively, a disease of the elderly (≥ 60 years of 
age; median age at diagnosis 69-71 years [SEER 2023; Juliusson 2017]) and discussed extensively the 
challenges  with treating the elderly unfit AML patient population including severe comorbidities and 
hospitalisation required.  
Illustrating the scale of the current parenteral HMA treatment burden for elderly unfit AML patients, in 
three multicentric observational (i.e. real world) studies of decitabine first-line treatment in the elderly 
(60-<70 years 12%; 70-74 years 34% 75-79 years 35%; ≥ 80 years 19%) unfit population conducted 
across Italy, the median number of cycles administered was 5, with patients receiving up to 31 cycles 
overall.  This is equivalent to 155 separate IV administration of decitabine across 155 clinic visits over 
approximately 2.5 years for those patients deriving the most treatment benefit; in other words these 
maximally benefiting patients likely spent nearly 18% of their days (up to 155 of 868 days) over that 
period in travelling to clinics/hospitals for treatment (Bocchia 2019).  Similarly, data from the 
expanded international E-ALMA series derived from 5 EU registries codify the frontline azacitidine 
therapy experience of a large series of 710 older (60-64 years 7.5%; 65-69 years 13%; 70-74 years 
25%; ≥75 years 54%) AML patients considered unfit for standard induction chemotherapy 
(Falantes 2017).  Patients received a median of 5 cycles of therapy, but up to 52 cycles in the longest 
treated individuals.  That equates to 364 subcutaneous injection (SC) injections of azacitidine 
equivalent to a full calendar year of clinic visits and equating to 25% of all days across 4 years partially 
spent traveling to clinics for treatment for the longest treated patients. 
Patient preference for convenient oral chemotherapy 
The sponsor discussed several studies that illustrate the aspects of the 'treatment burden' and how 
oral therapy would significantly improve upon them in a manner that would be a major improvement in 
patient care. 
Furthermore, the sponsor has conducted a small patient preference study in 21 AML patients, median 
age 51 years (range 33-72 years), who were using/have used HMA or were suitable to be treated with 
HMA (i.e., unfit for standard induction therapy) (Delmas 2023).  Patients were recruited in the UK, 
Spain, and Germany.  The patients had 60-minute interviews conducted by trained interviewers.  The 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000141337 
Page 9/20 
 
 
 
interviews included the following topics: experiences of AML (diagnosis and engagement with 
healthcare system since), experiences of HMA treatments, perspectives on HMA treatments, 
perspectives on the profile of oral ASTX727 (presented as a hypothetical treatment), perceived unmet 
need in the treatment of AML, and factors that determine treatment satisfaction/preferences and 
relative importance of different treatment-related characteristics.  Most patients expressed as 
preference for the hypothetical oral therapy (76%) over a parenteral HMA (SC or IV) (14%).  The 
primary reasons for this preference were convenience (48% of respondents mentioned this), not 
wanting to go to the clinic for treatment (e.g. travel and waiting time; 10%), and reduced risk of 
infection (caught in a clinic, 5%).  Amongst characteristics that were important for treatment 
decisions, respondents mentioned efficacy (86%) and safety (62%) most often.  Other important 
characteristics included daily life impact and therapy duration (each 24%), and time spent in hospital, 
treatment duration, and financial impact (each 14%) (Delmas 2023).   
Finally, to illustrate the major contribution to patient care of oral ASTX727, the sponsor has conducted 
an online survey to evaluate the perspectives of US patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
receiving ASTX727, as an alternative to IV/SC HMAs (Zeidan 2023).  In total, 150 patients completed 
the survey, 61% of whom were ≥60 years of age, and 63% of whom were male.  At the time of the 
survey, 82% of patients were receiving ASTX727 and 18% had stopped taking that product.  Half 
(50%) of the patients had taken ASTX727 for ≥6 months.  Importantly, for the demonstration of a 
major contribution to patient care of ASTX727, 61% of patients (n=91) had received IV/SC HMA prior 
to oral ASTX727.  As a reminder, these patients are treated comparably to patients with AML as far as 
that relates to HMA posology. Majorities of patients (n=150) were satisfied (86%) with oral treatment 
and found it to be convenient (83%) (Figure 1). 
Figure 1.  Satisfaction with and convenience of oral ASTX727 amongst 150 adult patients with MDS

Convenience 
Most patients reported no or very little interference from oral ASTX727 treatment on regular daily 
activities (82%), social activities (78%), and productivity (78%) (Figure 2).

Most respondents felt a personal benefit (79%) and experienced an improvement in quality of life 
(85%) from oral ASTX727 compared with previous IV/SC treatment (Figure 3).

source: zeidan 2023 
These data are from an online survey amongst MDS patients who are somewhat younger on average 
than the AML population (median 69-70 years at diagnosis) and potentially more motivated (and 
technologically proficient) due to their ongoing treatment response.  For instance, half of all patients 
had received ≥6 months of treatment (i.e. ≥6 cycles), whereas the median EU AML patient receives 
approximately 5 cycles of HMA treatment (Bocchia 2019; Falantes 2017).  Further, the inclusion 
criteria did not differentiate between lower-risk MDS and higher-risk, and therefore more 'AML-like' 
MDS.  Nevertheless, that all participants were treated with a HMA implies most were higher-risk. 
COMP conclusion 
The COMP identified several issues with the preference study. First of all, it is based on a very small 
sample size (n=21), which may not be representative of the larger AML patient population. Second, 
the preference study is based on “purely theoretical preferences”, meaning it may not reflect real-
world experiences or outcomes. There’s also a difference between what patients might prefer 
hypothetically and how they actually respond to a treatment. Furthermore, there may be confounding 
variables that are not accounted for in the studies, such as the impact of other medications, lifestyle 
factors, or varying healthcare systems. 
In addition, the online survey was not part of a controlled study and participation was optional. This 
opens up the possibility of selection bias, as those who had positive experiences might be more 
inclined to participate. Finally, while it's mentioned that elderly/unfit patients have mobility challenges, 
there isn't enough data showing how Inaqovi specifically addresses this issue compared to traditional 
treatments. 
Based on the above, the COMP concluded that the sponsor should elaborate on the conclusiveness of 
the results of the preference study for the patients with AML, taking into account: first, the limitations 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000141337 
Page 11/20 
 
 
 
 
 
of the study design and second, the extent to which the results of the preference study demonstrate 
that Inaqovi ensures a major contribution to patient care in comparison with the satisfactory methods 
of treatment. 
Of particular importance is that a claim of major contribution to patient care may only be assessed 
once it is established that the candidate product is at the very least equivalent in terms of efficacy (and 
safety) to the satisfactory methods of treatment (see assessment below).

Indirect comparisons versus the satisfactory methods 
Significant benefit of Inaqovi (cedazuridine, decitabine) versus Dacogen (decitabine)

The sponsor concluded that this data supports the equivalence of ASTX727 to IV decitabine in terms of 
efficacy in the unfit AML population not eligible for induction chemotherapy. 
The sponsor also claimed that the mechanism of action of decitabine is DNA demethylation 
(Yang 2006; Steensma 2009), with the potential for cytotoxic activity, manifested predominantly by 
myelosuppression (anaemias and cytopenias), neutropenia-related infections, and thrombocytopenia-
related bleeding events.  These same effects have been consistently reported in the labelled safety 
information (adverse drug reactions [ADRs]) for IV decitabine and SC azacitidine. A comparison of 
frequencies of adverse drug reactions for IV Dacogen in AML with those reported for in ASTX727-02 
EU, and with overall AML/MDS/CMML Safety Population by CTCAE grade was presented in Table 4. 
The sponsor referred to the CHMP assessment that the safety profile of ASTX727 is comparable with 
that for Dacogen and therefore that the safety information included in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) for the two products should be identical. 
COMP conclusion 
The COMP agreed that the efficacy and safety of Inaqovi is equivalent to the efficacy and safety of 
Dacogen.  
Significant benefit of Inaqovi (cedazuridine, decitabine) versus Vidaza (azacitidine)

a The median OS (16 months) with conventional care in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was atypically high (Fenaux 
2010), which suggested bias in the patient selection, particularly the exclusion of patients with proliferative AML 
(WBCs >10,000/µL), who are known to have worse prognoses (discussed in Kantarjian et al, 2012). 
b Pre-planned analysis: 67 azacitidine treated patients censored at the time of starting subsequent treatment in the 
analysis of Dombret et al, 2015.  Unknown number censored in the analysis of Seymour et al, 2017 which was 
conducted in AML-MRC subset of patients; note the authors report a median OS of 11.4 months in the azacitidine 
group from the sensitivity analysis in the description of survival results, but a median OS of 10.8 months in the 
corresponding Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 2b in the publication).   
c As originally reported.  Upon post-hoc central review of histological samples (Seymour et al, 2017), it was 
determined that 53% overall in this arm had AML-MRC 
d A further 10.3% of subjects were either non-evaluable (5.7%) or had a missing (4.6%) cytogenetic risk 
classification. 
The sponsor argued that data reported in the literature support that SC azacitidine and IV decitabine 
are associated with comparable levels of efficacy. 
In the absence of a direct, comparative clinical trial, the functional equivalence of the two HMAs is 
supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and retrospective 
studies on the efficacy of decitabine and azacitidine monotherapy in the general, newly diagnosed AML 
population (Saiz Rodríguez 2021).  A total of 2743 patients from 23 cohorts were analysed (10 cohorts 
of azacitidine and 13 of decitabine).  The results are presented below.

Separately, Ma et al, 2021 reported the results of a systematic review and network meta-analysis 
comparison of azacitidine with decitabine in patients with AML or high-risk MDS (HR-MDS).  Eight 
randomised controlled studies (n=2,184) were identified in the network meta-analysis.  Four trials 
compared azacitidine to CCR, and four compared decitabine to CCR.  Whilst this analysis therefore 
includes a second indication, OS results indicate broadly comparable overall survival in the AML 
populations. 
In the real-world setting, previously described US data from Zeidan et al, 2020 support that the clinical 
outcomes across 2,263 older patients (≥66 years; median 77 years) treated with HMA monotherapy 
(IV decitabine or SC azacitidine) are clinically comparable in terms of median overall survival (8.2 and 
7.1 months, respectively).  Albeit, in multivariate analysis a slightly mortality risk was observed for 
patients treated with azacitidine compared with decitabine (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01 1.21; P = 0.02). 
The sponsor also argues on similar safety of Inaqovi vs Vidaza (azacitidine) and presented an indirect 
comparison of the adverse reactions reported in the SmPCs including comparisons with Dacogen as 
well to justify similar safety of Vidaza in comparison to Dacogen. 
COMP conclusion 
The sponsor should further elaborate on the extent to which the results of the preference study 
demonstrate that Inaqovi ensures a major contribution to patient care in comparison with Vidaza. 
Significant benefit of Inaqovi (cedazuridine, decitabine) versus Venclyxto (venetoclax)  
Venetoclax in combination with an HMA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. 
The sponsor claimed that the efficacy of InaqoviSTX727 as monotherapy is inferior to that of 
venetoclax plus IV decitabine or SC azacitidine (Table 6).  Conversely, and intuitively, the cumulative 
toxicity (ADRs) associated with either doublet must be worse than that of ASTX727.  Albeit that point 
is difficult to prove. 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000141337 
Page 16/20 
 
 
 
However, the sponsor considers that a comparison of ASTX727 with the venetoclax plus HMA doublet 
combinations is the wrong comparison for the purposes of demonstrating significant benefit.  It follows 
that the correct comparison is: venetoclax + oral ASTX727 vs venetoclax + IV decitabine/SC 
azacitidine.  In all doublets venetoclax is a daily orally administered product.  IV decitabine and SC 
azacitidine are administered as the same regimens—5 days or 7 days per 28-day cycle, respectively—
as when used as monotherapy.

A further 10.3% of subjects were either non-evaluable (5.7%) or had a missing (4.6%) cytogenetic risk 
COMP conclusion 
The sponsor is invited to substantiate further whether Inaqovi is at least equivalent in terms of 
efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance as compared to Venclyxto (venetoclax) in its authorised 
indication. 
Significant benefit of Inaqovi (cedazuridine, decitabine) versus Daurismo (glasdegib) + LDAC 
The sponsor claimed that the combination of glasdegib and LDAC, although notionally considered to be 
a satisfactory method of treatment of AML in the unfit population unsuited for standard induction 
chemotherapy, is not recommended for this use in the current ELN treatment guideline (Döhner 2022) 
and ESMO guideline (Heuser 2020). 
Glasdegib is associated with a boxed warning for embryo-foetal toxicity, albeit that is unlikely to be 
relevant to the generally older unfit AML population.  In combination with LDAC, glasdegib is also 
associated with QT interval prolongation which should be monitored for early in treatment.  Glasdegib 
in combination with LDAC is also associated with muscle-related adverse events, including pain 
tenderness and weakness.  Further, patients with pre-existing renal impairment or risk factors for renal 
dysfunction, who are more likely to be older patients, require close monitoring.  None of these safety 
issues pertain to the use of ASTX727 in the same AML population. 
The sponsor presented an indirect comparison of response and OS of ASTX727 vs glasdegib + LDAC 
(Table 8). The sponsor concluded that ASTX727 offers a significant benefit over glasdegib and LDAC in 
terms of improved safety on a background of at least comparable efficacy, and a major contribution to 
patient care in terms of ease of administration.

COMP conclusion 
The COMP agreed that the efficacy and safety of Inaqovi is equivalent to the efficacy of Daurismo 
(glasdegib) + LDAC. The sponsor should further elaborate on the extent to which the results of the 
preference study demonstrate that Inaqovi (cedazuridine, decitabine) ensures a major contribution to 
patient care in comparison with versus Daurismo (glasdegib) + LDAC. 
4.  COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor sought to establish the existence of significant benefit of Inaqovi (cedazuridine, 
decitabine) vis-à-vis the satisfactory methods of treatment on the basis of the claim of major 
contribution to patient care.  
• 
• 
It is recalled that a claim of major contribution to patient care may only be assessed once it is 
established that the candidate product is at the very least equivalent in terms of efficacy (and 
safety) to the satisfactory methods of treatment. On that basis, the sponsor is invited to 
substantiate further whether Inaqovi and the satisfactory method of treatment Venclyxto 
(venetoclax) in its authorised indication are equivalent in terms of efficacy. 
The sponsor is further invited to elaborate on the conclusiveness of the results of the preference 
study for the patients with AML, taking into account: first, the limitations of the study design; and 
second, the extent to which the results of the preference study demonstrate that Inaqovi ensures a 
major contribution to patient care in comparison with the satisfactory methods of treatment.

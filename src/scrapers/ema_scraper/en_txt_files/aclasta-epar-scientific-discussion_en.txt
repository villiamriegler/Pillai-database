SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
The  adult  form  of  Paget’s  disease  of  the  bone  (PDB)  is  a  common  condition  with  a  strong  genetic 
component, characterised by focal increases in bone turnover, involving one or more bones throughout 
the skeleton. In affected areas, excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by disorganised bone 
formation resulting in low-quality (woven) bone of reduced mechanical integrity. The cited prevalence 
of  PDB  varies  considerably  by  geographic  area  and  criteria  for  diagnosis.  A  positive  family  history 
increases the risk markedly, but the exact mode of inheritance remains to be established. 
While the majority of patients remain asymptomatic, active PDB is associated with bone pain and risk 
of bone deformity, pathological fracture, osteoarthritis, and deafness. There is also a small but defined 
risk of the development of osteosarcoma. The activity of PDB is reflected in serum and urine levels of 
biochemical  markers  of  bone  turnover.  Currently  available  literature  does  not  provide  any  clear 
evidence  that  any  marker  is  superior  to  serum  total  alkaline  phosphatase  (SAP)  for  sensitivity  or 
specificity. 
Pharmacological therapy  of PDB aims  to reduce bone turnover and  is  currently based  on the  use of 
second-  or  third-generation  bisphosphonates.  It  should  be  noted  that  none  of  the  treatments  used  in 
PDB have been shown to prevent  complications  such  as deafness, fracture  or  deformity,  or alter the 
natural history of the disease. 
The  Applicant Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted a  complete stand-alone application  for Marketing 
Authorisation  for  Aclasta  for the proposed indication of  “Treatment  of Paget’s disease  of the bone”. 
The active substance of Aclasta, zoledronic acid (zoledronate)is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate 
with a mode of action involving inhibition of the enzymatic activity of farnesyl diphosphate synthase 
(FPP  synthase).  Inhibition  of  FPP  synthase  is  considered  a  main  mechanism  by  which  osteoclast 
activity is inhibited and apoptosis is promoted. Zoledronic acid, has been previously approved within 
the  EU  as  Zometa  (EMEA/H/C/336)  for  the  treatment  of  malignancy-induced  hypercalcaemia  and 
prevention  of  skeletal-related  events  in  patients  with  advanced  malignancies  involving  bone.  In  the 
oncology indications, zoledronic  acid is given  repeatedly as an intravenous infusion of 4  mg  over at 
least 15 minutes every 3-4 weeks. For Paget’s disease, on the other hand, zoledronic acid is proposed 
to be given as a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg to induce a long-lasting biochemical remission. 
The Applicant uses a separate invented name and label for the benign indication to avoid any potential 
confusion between the different doses and dosing interval, compared with the oncology indications.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Aclasta contains zoledronic acid as the active substance. It is presented as a clear, colourless aqueous 
solution for infusion containing 5.33 mg /100 ml of zoledronic acid monohydrate, which is equivalent 
to 5 mg /100 ml of anhydrous zoledronic acid. 
Other ingredients include mannitol, sodium citrate and water for injections. The container is a plastic 
vial  with  rubber stopper and  aluminium  with  flip  off  component. An  overfill is filled to the  vials to 
permit withdrawal of the labelled amount of zoledronic acid. 
Drug Substance  
The active substance is identical to the one used for the centrally authorised product Zometa, powder 
and  solvent  for  solution  for  infusion  (EMEA/H/C/336).  The  details  of  the  manufacturing  process, 
purification,  specifications  and  stability  have  already  been  assessed  for  the  above-mentioned 
application and are briefly summarised below. 
The  chemical  name  of  zoledronic  acid  is  (1-hydroxy-2-imidazol-1-ylphosphonoethyl)  phosphonic 
acid.

The  active  substance  does  not  contain  any  chiral  centers  and  thus  it  does  not  exhibit  any  optical 
isomers.  The  monohydrate  form  of  zoledronic  acid  was  selected,  because  of  its  good  chemical  and 
physical stability in the solid state  at ambient  temperature. The structure  of the active substance  has 
been confirmed using an array of suitable methods. 
Manufacture 
• 
The  active  substance  is  synthesised  by  multiple  steps  and  purified.  The  levels  of  the  impurities  are 
supported by the results of toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
• 
Specification 
The active substance specification is in accordance with the one accepted for the powder for solution 
for infusion formulation. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Drug Product  
• 
Due  to  the  poor  absorption  of  zoledronic  acid  after  oral  administration  the  pharmaceutical 
development  was  aimed  at  developing  a  parenteral  formulation.  In  order  to  facilitate  the 
administration  to  patients  by  health  professionals  a  “ready  to  infuse-solution”  was  found  more  safe 
and easy to use. The excipients used are mannitol and water for injection. The amount of excipients 
has been optimised to develop an isotonic solution and a stable buffering system for zoledronic acid. 
All  excipients  used  in  the  product  are  of  non-animal  origin  and  comply  with  their  corresponding 
European Pharmacopoeia monographs.  
 The immediate packaging materials are commonly used for these types of formulations and are made 
from  the  same  material  as  the  one  used  for  Zometa  4  mg/5ml  concentrate  for  infusion  (plastic 
colourless vials with bromobutyl rubber stoppers).  
Manufacture of the Product 
• 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  for  these  kind  of  formulations  and  sterilisation  is 
performed  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur.  All  critical  process  parameters  have  been 
identified  and  controlled  by  appropriate  in  process  controls.  The  validation  report  from  production 
scale batches demonstrates that the process is reproducible and provides a drug product that complies 
with the in-process and finished product specifications. 
Product Specification 
• 
The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  appearance, 
identification,  assay,  pH,  impurities,  particulate  matter,  degradation  products,  bacterial  endotoxins  
and sterility. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Batch analysis data from 6 batches have been presented. All batches met the test limits as defined in 
the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release. 
Stability of the Product 
• 
Stability studies were carried out according to ICH requirements.  
In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Aclasta is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation  has  been  submitted  for  marketing  authorization.  There  are  no  major  deviations  from 
EU and ICH requirements. 
The active substance is the same as the one used in the already centrally authorised product Zometa, 
powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  infusion  (EMEA/H/C/336).  It  is  well  characterised  and 
documented. The excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. 
Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly  used  and  well  documented.  The

manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  is  a  standard  process  that  has  been  adequately 
described. Stability tests indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable 
for the proposed shelf life.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Pivotal non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, conducted between 1987 and 2004, were in 
accordance with principles of GLP. 
Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo) 
Pharmacology 
• 
In  cultures  of  freshly  isolated  rabbit  and  human  osteoclasts  zoledronic  acid  (10-100  µM)  induced 
morphological  features  similar  to  apoptosis  and  caspase-3-like  activation.  Osteoclastogenesis  was 
inhibited  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  with  an  IC50  of  15  nM  in  vitro  in  cultures  of  murine  bone 
marrow cells stimulated to form osteoclasts by addition of macrophage-colony stimulating factor and 
ligand for the receptor activator NF-κB (RANKL). 
Zoledronic acid also inhibited proliferation of human foetal osteoblastic cell line (hFOB) with an IC50 
of  40  µM.  In  cultures  of  primary  human  trabecular  osteoblasts,  zoledronic  acid  increased 
osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor that binds to RANKL and inhibits interaction with RANK, inhibiting 
osteoclastogenesis. 
Inhibition of bone loss was investigated in ovariectomised (OVX) estrogen-deficient rats and monkeys. 
Efficacy and bone safety of zoledronic acid were evaluated in a 12-month study in the rat and in a 16-
month  study  in  the  rhesus  monkey.  Treatment  started  immediately  after  ovariectomization  in  both 
studies and subcutaneous doses of up to 12.5 µg/kg/week were used. The cumulative doses were 390 
µg/kg in rat and 862.5 µg/kg in monkey, as compared with an approximately 100 µg/kg human yearly 
dose. A  higher skeletal turnover in rat and possibly in monkey  could result in that drug  exposure in 
bones  in  OVX  animals  might  not  have  reached  human  exposure  levels.  These  issues  as  well  as 
potential indications  of  “frozen bone”, were  discussed during CHMP scientific  advice procedures. It 
was concluded that the available studies plus an 8-month study in OVX rats (see below), together with 
clinical data could be accepted as sufficient for addressing bone safety in non-oncology indications.  
Parameters  assessed  in  the  12-  and  16-month  studies  included  bone  mass,  bone  mechanics,  bone 
histomorphometry and biochemical markers of bone metabolism. In the rat, a dose of 1.5 µg/kg/week 
often resulted in full efficacy as determined by the parameters studied.  Bone mechanical parameters, 
femoral  neck  fracture,  femur  3-point  bending  and  vertebra  compression  were  dose-dependently 
increased by zoledronic acid towards levels in intact controls.  
Comparable  effects  were  noted  in  monkey,  but  mechanical  parameters  did  not  attain  statistical 
significance.  Histomorphometry  of  vertebral  cancellous  bone  showed  that  zoledronic  acid  increased 
trabecular area, trabecular  number,  node  number in  comparison  with OVX  control, while trabecular 
separation  was  decreased.  Bone  formation  rate  and  mineral  apposition  rate  were  decreased  dose-
dependently  by  zoledronic  acid.  In  monkey,  ovariectomization  had  no  remarkable  effect  on 
histomorphometric  parameters  of  cancellous  bone  in  the  vertebra,  radius  and  femur  at  week  69. 
Cancellous bone structure was not affected by zoledronic acid, but the activation frequency and bone 
formation  rate  were  decreased  at  all  doses,  while  mineral  apposition  rate  was  decreased  at  the  high 
dose  (12.5  µg/kg/week),  only.  In  cortical  bone,  zoledronic  acid  had  no  effect  on  mineral  apposition 
rate or on total Haversian bone. Porosity and bone formation rate were decreased by zoledronic acid in 
cortical bone of femoral shaft.  
An 8-month study in OVX rats given a single iv injection of 0.8, 4, 20, 100 or 500 µg/kg of zoledronic 
acid or 200 µg/kg of alendronate 4 days prior to ovariectomy was conducted to evaluate the duration 
of  a  bone  protective  effect.  Zoledronic  acid  dose-dependently  reduced  plasma  osteocalcin.  At  week


EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
32, levels were suppressed in the 100 and 500 µg/kg groups, only. Bone mineral density analysis of 
the  proximal  tibial  metaphysis  indicated  that  zoledronic  acid  from  20  µg/kg  protected  completely 
against bone loss up to 24 weeks. Alendronate had a similar but weaker effect. Analysis of cortical and 
cancellous bone separately showed that 4 µg/kg partially protected against cortical thinning up to 12 
weeks  and  against  cancellous  bone  loss  for  at  least  32  weeks.  Histomorphometric  parameters  in 
cancellous bone  of the  proximal tibia were  not affected by  zoledronic acid up to doses  of 20 µg/kg, 
while the two higher doses decreased bone formation to 45 and 21%, respectively, of the sham control 
level.  Zoledronic  acid  dose-dependently  prevented  loss  of  cancellous  bone  of  proximal  tibia  as 
indicated  by  3D-µCT  images  at  week  32.  Zoledronic  acid  prevented  loss  of  strength  of  femoral 
metaphysis  and  diaphysis  with  effects  at  20  µg/kg  generally  comparable  with  200  µg/kg  of 
alendronate.  High  doses  of  zoledronic  acid  100-500  µg/kg  tended  to  increase  bone  strength  above 
sham control levels. 
In  a  study  in  male  7-week  old  rats  with  bone  histomorphometry  assessed  using  static  and  dynamic 
parameters, mineralised bone tissue was increased dose-dependently by zoledronic acid. There was a 
dose-dependent  decrease  in  the  osteoid  perimeter  in  the  cancellous  bone.  The  significance  of  the 
osteoid  changes  is  unclear  but  could  result  from  a  decrease  in  the  activation  frequency  of  new 
remodelling  bone  units.  Retardation  of  longitudinal  bone  growth  was  reported  but  apparently  not 
related to a mineralisation disturbance of the growth plate.  
Mineralisation  parameters  in  monkey  indicated  that  a  continued  loss  of  bone  density  (humerus  and 
vertebra) occurred in both intact control and OVX control and was counteracted in OVX animals by 
doses ≥2.5 µg/kg. Reduction of the  central  and  distal  radius bone  mineral  density  was prevented by 
zoledronic  acid  in OVX  at  12.5  µg/kg/week.  Zoledronic  acid  dose-dependently  increased  carbonate 
content, reduced serum calcium at week 26 at the high dose and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
at week 52. Femoral neck stiffness was dose-dependently increased and activation frequency of new 
remodelling  sites  decreased.  No  evidence  of  a  mineralising  defect,  no  osteoid  accumulation,  and  no 
woven bone was reported. The decline of bone mineral density (BMD) of the distal and central radius 
in  both  OVX  and  control  groups  was  unexpected  and  could  not  be  explained,  however,  it  was 
prevented  by  doses  of  12.5  µg/kg/week.  Additionally,  zoledronic  acid  dose-dependently  decreased 
levels  of biochemical markers of osteoblastic bone formation (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin) and 
of osteoclastic bone resorption (N-telopeptide, pyridinoline), compared with OVX control. In general, 
similar effects were seen in both rat and monkey. 
Safety pharmacology 
• 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  of  zoledronic  acid  covered  major  organ  systems  such  as  the 
cardiovascular  and  autonomic,  respiratory,  gastrointestinal  and  renal  systems,  and  no  remarkable 
effects were reported.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
• 
No studies were submitted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  zoledronic  acid  has  been  studied  in  rat  and  dog.  No  data  are  available  for 
rabbit  and  mouse,  species  used  in  reproduction  toxicity  and  safety  pharmacology  studies.  The 
compound does not seem to be metabolised and, in view of the low tolerability in rabbits, the lack of 
data in the rabbit is not considered a significant problem for the interpretation of data. 
Absorption- Bioavailability 
• 
The primary parameters characterised indicate that the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid are overall 
similar to other bisphosphonates. In rats exposure was comparable after intravenous and subcutaneous 
doses with negligible gender differences. 
Distribution 
• 
Distribution studies in rat showed, as expected, that most of the dose was taken up by bone with tibia 
having the highest levels followed by vertebra and cranium. Initially about 60% of the dose is taken up 
4/24 

EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the bones and 40% still remains in bone after 1  year. The apparent half-life  of zoledronic acid in 
bone appears to be over 360 days. Quantitative analysis showed that, with the exception of long-term 
retention in bone, transient high levels were also observed in kidney and spleen. 
After repeated intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg in rat, accumulation was evident both in bone and soft 
tissue. Steady-state levels were not attained after 16 days of daily dosing. Accumulation in soft tissues 
was, however, more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than in bone and declined with an apparent half-
life  of  150  to  200  days  after  treatment  had  stopped.  In  a  3-month  study  in  rats given  subcutaneous 
doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day, no accumulation in plasma was recorded. 
Metabolism (in vitro/in vivo) 
• 
Zoledronic acid is not metabolised. There is no evidence of metabolites circulating in plasma or being 
excreted in urine. 
Excretion 
• 
Zoledronic acid is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys after intravenous administration 
with less than 3% in the feces in rat and dog. Most of the radioactivity was excreted during the first 24 
hours (renal plus fecal 33% of dose in rats and 23% in dogs) after which excretion proceeded at low 
rates  so  that  approximately  60%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  after  12  months.  No  true  elimination  of 
radioactivity could be determined from selected bones such as tibia. 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
• 
In  single  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  a  minimum  lethal  dose  of  8  mg/kg  was  identified  after 
intravenous  bolus  injection.  The  cause  of  death  at  high  single  doses  quite  likely  involved  cardiac 
and/or renal effects. 
Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
• 
The toxicity of zoledronic acid after repeated doses was investigated in rat and dog in studies up to 1 
year using subcutaneous and intravenous (bolus or infusion) administration routes and various dosing 
schedules.  The  toxicological  profile  of  zoledronic  acid  showed  similarities  with  that  of  other 
bisphosphonates.  The  most  common  effects  in  toxicity  studies  were  increased  primary  spongiosa  in 
the metaphyses of long bones (non-proliferative hyperostosis) in growing animals, a finding reflecting 
pharmacological antiresorptive activity. At high doses, effects possibly irritant, in organs such as GI-
tract (haemorrhage, erosions, also after iv administration), liver (hepatocellular necrosis, haemorrhage, 
inflammation),  spleen  (inflammation,  haemorrhage),  lungs  (inflammatory  lesions)  were  reported,  as 
well as irritation at injection sites. Effects, possibly secondary to poor physical condition, were noted 
in lymphoid  organs and  reproductive tract.  Renal  effects  were  seen in  rat and  dog studies  and  were 
characterised  by  renal  tubular  necrosis/regeneration  and  inflammation  with  increased  blood  urea 
nitrogen  (BUN)  and  creatinine  values.  Effects  on  renal  function  and  integrity  seemed  to  occur  at 
decreasing  doses  with  increasing  study  duration.  In  rat studies,  males  appeared  more  sensitive  than 
females.  Recently  bisphosphonates  have  been  associated  with  a  potential  to  cause  eye  disorders  in 
clinical  use.  Ophthalmological  examinations  in  preclinical  studies  did  not  however  indicate  any 
untoward ocular effects.  
Renal  effects  in  rats  (tubular  necrosis,  regeneration,  hyaline  casts,  focal  tubular  basophilia)  were 
reported  in  10-day  iv  bolus  (6  mg/kg/d),  2-week  iv  (3.2  mg/kg/d),  10-day  sc  (0.6  mg/kg/d)  and  12-
month sc (0.003 mg/kg/d) studies. No kidney effects were reported in the 13-week sc rat study at the 
high  dose  of  0.1  mg/kg/d.  Renal  effects  in  dogs  (e.g.  tubular  degeneration/necrosis,  inflammation, 
increase in connective tissue, cellular casts, tubular basophilia and urothelial hyperplasia) were noted 
in  3-month  iv  (0.2  mg/kg/d),  13-week  iv  infusion  (0.25  mg/kg/3x  week),  26-week  iv  infusion  (0.25 
mg/kg/3x  week)  and  26/52-week  iv  bolus  (0.1  mg/kg/every  2nd  or  3rd  day)  studies.  In  dog,  kidney 
effects seemed to develop after cumulative doses of 2.2 g/kg both after injection and infusion. Renal 
effects appeared reversible after a 26 weeks recovery period. In a 26-week intravenous infusion study 
in dogs with administration every third week, kidney effects were recorded in all groups after 9 doses 
of 0.25 mg/kg. A renal NOEL of 0.25 mg/kg after 3 doses was proposed.  
5/24

The dog studies indicate that infusion time is one factor that is involved in the expression of kidney 
toxicity,  such  that  a  shortening  of  the  infusion  time  appeared  to  be  coupled  to  less  adverse  renal 
effects. Furthermore, local kinetics of zoledronic acid in the kidney may influence potential for renal 
toxicity. The reason for the differences in the potential of zoledronic acid to cause kidney toxicity in 
various  rat  studies  is  not  clear.  Zoledronic  acid  used  in  malignancy  indications  that  involve  daily 
dosing  may  have  significant  renal  toxicity.  Although  the  current  indication  entails  a  single  dose 
therapeutic regimen, a slow release of zoledronic acid from bone  after a single dose and elimination 
via kidneys may represent a situation comparable to local repeated low exposure. However it is likely, 
that the exposure  will be low  enough for  kidney toxicity  not to be  manifested in the time periods in 
question.   
In  rat  studies,  common  clinical  chemistry  changes  included  elevated  alanine  aminotransferase 
(ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), cholinesterase, α2, β globulin levels, increased alkaline 
phosphatase  (AP),  creatinine,  BUN  and  Mg.  After  subcutaneous  administration  of  doses  over  0.6 
mg/kg  reduced  erythrocytic  parameters,  increased  granculocytic  and  coagulation  parameters  were 
noted. In a  rat 1-month subcutaneous toxicity  study,  doses  of 0.2  mg/kg increased  white blood  cells 
(WBC),  decreased  Ca,  P,  AP  and  AP  liver  isozymes.  All  changes  were  reversible  except  for  AP. 
Increased levels  of  creatinine  kinase  were  noted  from 0.02 mg/kg/d. Histopathological target  organs 
included  GI-tract  (gastric  mucosal  degeneration,  multifocal  necrosis  of  glandular  epithelium),  liver 
(degeneration,  increased  hepatocyte  and  Kupffer  cell  mitosis,  periportal  hepatocellular  hypertrophy, 
phagocytic  activity),  adrenal  (hypertrophy),  spleen  (clear  macrophages,  lymphocytolysis),  lymph 
nodes  (lymphocytolysis),  thymus  (lymphocytolysis,  clear  macrophages)  and  lung  (increased  cellular 
infiltration).  Vasculitis  and  cellulitis  fasciitis  at  the  injection  site  were  described.  Skeletal  muscle 
lesions in the thigh muscle were reported at doses over 0.06 mg/kg.  
In  view  of  the  thymus  lymphocytosis,  increases  of  macrophages  in  spleen,  lymph  nodes,  thymus 
atrophy, duodenum inflammation reported in a number of toxicity studies, the Applicant presented an 
evaluation and discussion on possible immunotoxic effects of zoledronic acid. The review of data, also 
considering dosing regimens in relation to the once yearly intended in clinical therapy, did not indicate 
any  unexpected  immunotoxicity.  Bisphosphonates  in  the  clinic  are  however  known  to  have  the 
potential to cause an acute-phase reaction.  
In a  3-month subcutaneous toxicity study  at doses ≥0.03 mg/kg/day, broken/shortened incisors  were 
noted  in  males  during  the  recovery  period.  Bisphosphonates  have  been  reported  to  produce 
mineralisation defects specifically in rat incisor dentine. There was a non dose-dependent lengthening 
of  metaphyseal  primary  spongiosa,  increased  metaphyseal  bone  diameters  in  femur  and  tibia  (non-
reversible)  and  a  compensatory bone  marrow  hypercellularity.  In  a  6/12-month  subcutaneous  study, 
testicular  atrophy  was  reported  in  the  0.01  mg/kg  group  at  12  months  with  changes  showing 
reversibility. Examination of tibia from selected rats showed that mineralised tissue at the distal border 
changed to primary spongiosa. The changes were paralleled by a strong reduction in bone formation at 
the  cellular  and  tissue  levels.  The  effects  were  consistent  with  inhibition  of  bone  resorption  and 
consequent reduction of bone turnover, related to the pharmacological effect of zoledronic acid. 
In dog studies, common clinical chemistry changes included elevated activated partial thromboplastin 
time  (APTT),  creatinine  kinase,  increased  ASAT,  ALAT,  lactate  and  glutamate  dehydrogenase,  Mg 
and  decreased  erythrocytic parameters, AP bone  isozyme activity and albumin levels. At doses  over 
0.02  mg/kg  P,  Ca  and  K  were  decreased.  Increases  in  urea,  bilirubin,  total  lipids,  cholesterol, 
triglycerides  and  total  protein  were  findings  in  several  studies.  Injection  site  lesions  (cellulitis, 
phlebitis)  were  present  in  most  studies.  Stomach  changes  (gastric  inflammation,  mineralisation, 
ulceration, atrophy, oedema), bone changes (increased mesenchymatous tissue and/or bone deposition 
in medullary cavities of femur, sternum, rib) and slight mineralisation in the bone marrow were noted. 
The  bone  findings  were  not  reversible  and  the  effects  were  in  part  ascribed to  the  pharmacological 
activity of zoledronic acid. In a 26/52-week study, testicular changes, focal atrophy, degeneration and 
mineralisation of the seminiferous tubules were noted in some dogs at doses of 0.03 mg/kg at the end 
of 26 weeks, only.

Bone  physical  chemistry,  morphometry  and  mechanical  properties  were  studied  in  dogs  after  6,  12 
months treatment and following a 6-month recovery period. Physical chemistry parameters indicated a 
shift  towards  greater  mineralisation  between  6  and  12  months.  At  12  months,  the  mineralisation 
profile in  vertebrae had shifted towards higher  densities.  This was not noted in the  femur, probably 
due  to  lower  turnover  in  cortical  bone.  Tetracycline  labelling  was  inadequate  to  assess  dynamic 
parameters.  At  6  and  12  months  no  difference  in  the  structural  parameters  such  as  bone  volume, 
trabecular thickness, cortical areas, cortical thickness were reported with regard to the proximal tibial 
side. Osteoid surface and volumes were decreased consistent with decreased bone turnover.  Osteoid 
thickness and osteoid  volume  were  not increased, indicative  of the absence  of  mineralisation  defect. 
Bone  formation  resumed  after  the  6-month  recovery  period,  suggesting  reversibility.  Biomechanics 
indicated  a  significant  increase  in  density  and  mechanical  properties  of  trabecular  bone  with 
zoledronic acid treatment, prominent at 0.03 mg/kg. Cortical bone density and mechanical properties 
of cortical or trabecular bone structures were not affected.  After 12 months, there was a trend towards 
an increase in density and mechanical properties of trabecular core. A significant increase in density 
and  mechanical  properties  of  whole  vertebrae  was  also  evident.  The  NOEL  for  bone  safety  was 
considered  to  be  0.1  mg/kg  when  given  on  alternating  days  for  16  weeks  and  then  every  3rd  day 
through week 52. 
Interspecies comparisons were based on renal NOAEL in various studies, and for comparison a human 
systemic  exposure  of  1001  ngxhour/ml  after  5  mg  was  used.  Based  on  AUC  after  a  single  dose 
margins  of  exposure  in  dog  studies  was  <1  to  3-fold  higher  than  human  exposure,  while  based  on 
cumulative  AUC  values,  exposure  multiples  of  4  to12  were  obtained.  In  rat  studies  corresponding 
values ranged from 1 to 9 based on cumulative AUC, and <1 to 4 based on AUC values after a single 
dose.  Exposure multiples based on Cmax values were generally higher for rat, but lower for dog. 
Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo 
• 
Zoledronic  acid  was  assessed  for  genotoxic  potential  in  a  standard  battery  of  tests.  There  was  no 
indication of the compound having genotoxic activity either in vitro or in vivo. 
Carcinogenicity  
• 
Long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mouse  and  rat  by  oral  gavage  at  doses  up  to  2.0  mg/kg/day 
showed an increased incidence of Harderian gland tumours in male mice, but the increase was within 
historical  control  limits  since  the  Harderian  gland  tumours  have  no  human  correlate,  such  that  the 
clinical relevance of this observation is limited. 
Reproductive and developmental studies 
• 
The  reproductive  toxicity  of  zoledronic  acid  was  studied  in  rat  and  rabbit.  The  fertility  and  early 
embryonic developmental study was terminated early due to deaths/sacrifices linked to difficulties at 
parturition  (dystocia) observed  at doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg;  effects partly  ascribed to the  calcium 
depleting effects of the compound. Toxicity was also evident in embryo/foetal development studies in 
rat. A marked increase in pre and post implantation loss, increased resorptions and a decreased number 
of viable foetuses was recorded at 0.6 mg/kg. In the second rat study foetal weights were decreased at 
doses over 0.2 mg/kg and post implantation increased at 0.4 mg/kg. Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in 
rat at doses ≥0.2 mg/kg with malformations such as cleft palate, displaced ventricle and dilatation of 
major vessels, dilated lateral brain ventricles, thickening or curving of the clavicle, humerus and ulna. 
The teratogenicity was considered a direct effect and not a consequence of maternal toxicity although 
evident.  
Zoledronic acid was not well tolerated in rabbits and in a dose range finding study in pregnant rabbits 
doses  over  0.2  mg/kg  resulted  in  severe  clinical  signs,  body  weight  loss  and  animals  had  to  be 
sacrificed. In a second study doses over 0.01 mg/kg caused maternal toxicity. Signs of hypocalcaemia 
were recorded. Overall, the compound did not appear to be teratogenic in rabbits since the incidence 
of malformations was comparable in all groups.  
No prenatal and postnatal development study was conducted as the findings in the fertility and early 
embryonic development study indicated this would not be meaningful. In general, effects noted in the 
studies were not unexpected. These observations have been adequately reflected in the SPC.

Local tolerance 
• 
Similar  to  other  bisphosphonates,  zoledronic  acid  had  local  irritating  effects  upon  subcutaneous  or 
intravenous administration. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  potential  for  ecotoxicity,  risk  to  the  environment  has  been  addressed  in  separate  reports. 
Calculated predicted environmental concentrations do not indicate any cause for immediate concern. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
There  are  no  validated  animal  models  of  Paget’s  disease.  The  etiology  of  the  disease  is  unknown 
although  it  appears  to  be  generally  accepted  that  abnormal  osteoclasts  are  central  to  the 
pathophysiology.  As  well  as  inhibiting  bone  resorption,  zoledronic  acid  had  less  marked  inhibitory 
effects  on osteoblasts and  decreased bone  formation in vivo. Thus, inhibition of bone resorption  and 
bone formation may occur concomitantly, but effects were dose-dependent with some maintenance of 
function and bone formation, although at levels lower than in controls.  
Studies in estrogen-deficient animals indicated that bone mass was maintained and reduction of bone 
mechanic  parameters  of  femur,  tibia  and  vertebra  in  rat  were  dose-dependently  prevented  by 
zoledronic acid, and the effects were evident only when starting treatment prior to induction of bone 
loss. A study in which zoledronic acid treatment of OVX rats was initiated 8 weeks after ovariectomy 
demonstrated  that  the  compound  does  not  exert  a  “curative”  effect.  Animal  bone  studies  generally 
showed  expected  effects  with  no  significant  undesirable  changes  occurring  at  relevant  doses.  Taken 
together the studies available for zoledronic acid are considered sufficient from the preclinical point of 
view. 
In a case with a compound such as zoledronic acid subject to rapid sequestration and retention in bone, 
the  clinical  relevance  of  animal  models  used  in  toxicology  studies  would  not  seem  appropriately 
assessed  using  conventional  methods  based  on  e.g.  metabolite  comparisons  and  exposure  levels. 
Considering excretion routes and distribution pattern, the species used seem generally relevant. 
Data  from  the  toxicology  programme  indicated  that  the  most  frequent  effect  induced  by  zoledronic 
acid was an increase in primary spongiosa in the metaphyses related to the pharmacological activity in 
addition to adverse effects that were primarily directed at the kidney, liver and gastrointestinal tract.

Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Pharmacokinetic  data  are  mainly  from  previous  studies  in  cancer  patients.  There  are  no  specific 
pharmacokinetic data for patients with Paget’s disease, but the disease state is not expected to affect 
the  pharmacokinetics  and  conclusions  from  previous  studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  present 
application. 
Absorption  
• 
Not applicable 
Distribution 
• 
At the end of infusion, plasma  concentrations showed a rapid, multiphasic decline reaching < 1% of 
peak levels after 24 hours. Thereafter, low plasma levels persisted over a long period (≤ 0.1% of peak 
levels  at  day  29  after  a  16  mg  dose).  The  initial  rapid  decline  is  suggested  to  reflect  the  combined 
processes  of  binding  and  uptake  in  bone  and  renal  elimination.  The  persisting,  low  levels  thereafter 
reflect  the  slow  re-distribution  from  bone.  The  long-term  binding  of  zoledronic  acid  to  bone  is  the 
rationale for the single-dose administration proposed for Paget’s disease of the bone.  
In  vitro,  14C-zoledronic  acid  in  blood  showed  no  major  affinity  for  red  blood  cells.  Plasma  protein 
binding was moderate (approximately 56%) and did not vary with concentration. Animal data and the 
low recovery of 14C-zoledronic acid in humans indicate that most of the drug is bound to bone tissue.  
Elimination 
• 
Study  506,  with  14C-zoledronic  acid,  indicated  no  metabolism  in  humans.  The  compound  was 
primarily eliminated unchanged via renal excretion, but recovery of radioactivity was low. Most of the 
recovered radioactivity was excreted within 24 hours after end of infusion (29%). After 72 hours, 32% 
was recovered and at later timepoints the concentrations in urine were generally below the detection 
limit. In a pooled data set of 64 patients from studies J001, 503 and 506, the CLR of zoledronic acid 
represented  75±33%  of  the  estimated  creatinine  clearance  (CLcr),  which  averaged  84  ml/min.  The 
renal and total plasma clearances of zoledronic acid were strongly correlated to CLcr.  
In preclinical studies, less than 5% of a dose was excreted in faeces.  
Due  to  the  slow  re-distribution  of  zoledronic  acid  from  bone,  which  may  be  dependent  on  bone  re-
γ
 of 146 hours was estimated 
modelling, the terminal t1/2 could not be adequately determined. A t1/2 
from the population pharmacokinetic analysis, but was thought likely to be  an underestimation. The 
AUC  area  under  the  curve  0-24 hours  (AUC0-24 hours)  was  therefore  used  for  estimation  of  key 
pharmacokinetic parameters.  
In a new study no. 1101 in 10 cancer patients, the half-life after a single 4 mg dose was estimated to be 
198  hours.  Cumulative  excretion  of  drug  in  urine  after  24  hours  was  32.6%  of  the  dose.  Plasma 
clearance was 4.85 L/hr and CLR 2.44 L/hr. Thus, CLR was about 50% of the total clearance and the 
remainder is likely to be binding to bone.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
The  AUC0-24 hour was  dose proportional between  doses of  2 and 16 mg.  According to the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, the predicted plasma clearance at doses 2, 8 and 16 mg was 108%, 92% and 
79%, respectively, of the clearance at a 4 mg dose. Thus, clearance appeared to decrease slightly with 
increasing doses.  
There  was  no  significant  accumulation  in  plasma  at  multiple  doses  given  every  28  days.  The 
AUC0-24 hours  at  later  doses  was  1.13-fold  higher  than  after  the  first  dose.  Assessment  of  time- 
dependency was not considered to be important for the present application, since only a single dose is 
recommended.

Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
The exposure was about 30-40% higher in patients with mild to moderate impairment. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, CLR in patients with CLcr of 20, 50 and 140 ml/min was estimated to be 
37%, 72% and 149%, respectively, of that for a patient with CLcr of 80 ml/min. No dose adjustment is 
considered necessary at mild to moderate impairment while due to paucity of data, zoledronic acid is 
not recommended to patients with severe renal impairment. 
Impaired liver function 
No study was performed in patients with hepatic impairment, as zoledronic acid is not metabolised in 
the  liver  nor  excreted  via  bile,  and  hepatic  impairment  is  therefore  not  expected  to  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics of the compound.  
Gender, Race, Weight and Age 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis on the pooled data set of 64 patients from three studies, 
there were no effects of gender, race, body weight or age that would warrant specific dose 
adjustments.  
Children 
No data are available, and Aclasta is not recommended in children and adolescents.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
Previously  submitted  studies  indicated  no  inhibition  of  hepatic  enzymes  in  vitro  by  zoledronic  acid 
(CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11).  
No  in  vivo  interaction  studies  have  been  performed,  since  zoledronic  acid  is  not  metabolised,  and 
shows no potential for inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes.  
Induction was not discussed, but has not been identified as a problem for other bisphosphonates and, 
moreover, would not be expected to occur at a single dose administration. 
The risk for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions is expected to be low.  
Mechanism of action 
Pharmacodynamics 
• 
Like other bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts and, secondarily, 
bone turnover by binding to bone surfaces, especially in areas of high bone turnover. As demonstrated 
in the  Zometa  dossier, zoledronic acid  reduces the  osteoclastic hyperactivity of lytic  or blastic bone 
lesions. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
• 
Preclinical  and  clinical  data  showed  that  zoledronic  acid  has  potent  bisphosphonate  effects  on  bone 
turnover,  which  should  make  it  potentially  useful  for  the  indication  treatment  of  PDB.  The  clinical 
studies submitted in Paget’s disease provided additional information concerning pharmacodynamics in 
this population and separate PK/PD studies were not considered necessary.  Relevant biomarkers for 
studying the efficacy of zoledronic acid were chosen. 
Combined data  from PDB studies 2304 and 2305 showed that the  median levels  of serum and  urine 
resorption  markers  C-telopeptide  (CTx)  were  decreased  to  within  normative  ranges  by  10  days  of 
dosing.   
Bone histomorphometry data from a limited number of M6 bone biopsies obtained within trial 2304 
demonstrated  the  expected  reduction  in  bone  turnover  with  an  anti-resorptive  agent.  Osteoblast 
function  as  evaluated  by  fractional  mineralising  surfaces  indicated  continued  bone  turnover  with 
zoledronic  acid.  No  mineralisation  defects  were  evident  and  the  mineral  apposition  rate  was  also 
unchanged relative to placebo. Qualitative assessment indicated no evidence of abnormal bone quality. 
10/24 

EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional  histomorphometric  data  will  be  made  available  from  the  post  menopausal  osteoporosis 
programme (POP) studies with zoledronic acid 5 mg annually. 
Dose response studies 
Clinical efficacy  
• 
The two  early  dose-ranging trials 001, 002 contributed little  data  of interest. The studies showed  no 
clinically relevant efficacy to reduce bone markers at doses under 200 µg. Although signs of efficacy 
were  noted  with  the  highest  dose  of  400  µg  (47%  reduction  of  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  at  3 
months),  this  extrapolates  to  changes  that  are  considerably  less  than  the  >75%  reduction  of  SAP 
excess or SAP normalisation, which is required to meet the definition of a clinical responder. 
The  dose  selected  for  the  pivotal  PDB  trials  is  the  same  as  that  being  evaluated  for  once  yearly 
administration within the ongoing POP for zoledronic  acid. It could be noted that the CHMP, during 
scientific advice,  expressed reservations  whether this would be the  optimal dose  for POP and that it 
might carry an unnecessary risk of over-suppression of bone turnover in POP. Whether this argument 
is of relevance for (extralesional) bone safety in PDB remains speculative. It may be relevant to note 
that  the  5  mg  dose  recommended  for  PDB  is  substantially  less  than  the  annual  cumulative  dose 
administered in the majority of oncology patients.   
In summary, the choice of dose of zoledronic acid in Paget’s disease has not been properly justified by 
dose-response or other preparatory studies. Nevertheless, the benefit/risk of the proposed regimen has 
been assessed from the two available controlled studies in the target population, and in addition some 
safety data from the ongoing POP trials. 
Main studies 
• 
Two largely identical Phase III studies (2305, 2304) have been performed in support of the indication 
for  the  treatment  of  PDB, focusing  on  effects  on  alkaline phosphatases  over  six  months  of  a  single 
dose  of  5  mg  zoledronic  acid  and  aiming  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  this  regimen  vs.  an 
approved regimen of risedronate 30 mg q.d., dosed during 60 days. 
Studies 2305 and 2304 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
Trials 2305, 2304 enrolled male and female patients >30 years with a confirmed diagnosis of PDB and 
serum  alkaline  phosphatases  (SAP)  at  baseline  ≥2xULN.  The  minimum  washout  periods  for  prior 
calcitonin  and  bisphosphonate  therapy  were  set  at  90  and  180  days,  respectively.  Patients  with 
calculated GFR <30 ml/min or urine protein ≥2+ were excluded from participation.

Additional  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  interest  were  presented  by  the  Applicant.  The 
distribution with respect to the proportion of patients with polyostotic/monostotic disease is consistent 
with the characteristics of the general population with Paget’s disease.  
Treatments 
A  single  dose  of  zoledronic  acid  5  mg  given  as  an  infusion  over  15  min  (followed  by  risedronate 
placebo)  vs.  risedronate  30  mg  q.d.  for  60  days.  The  regimen  for  risedronate  is  that  approved 
throughout Europe. 
All patients were supplemented with calcium and multivitamins, including vitamin D. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  show  non-inferiority  of  zoledronic  acid  relative  to  risedronate  with 
respect  to  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  proportion  of  responders  at  six  months.  See  also  below

(statistical  methods).  The  objective  was  considered  to  be  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  during  scientific 
advice. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients who achieved therapeutic response, 
defined as normalisation of SAP or at least 75% reduction from baseline of excess SAP at the end of 
six months. 
Secondary efficacy variables included (log transformed values for bone markers)

Relative change in SAP at D28

Change in pain scores (BPI-SF) over time 
Exploratory analyses included 
(cid:0) 
Proportions of patients who achieved SAP normalisation at D 10, 63, 91, 182 
Sample size 
Sample size calculations were based on the non-inferiority criterion of –0.16 for the primary efficacy 
variable. This margin is argued to maintain at least 75% of the effect of risedronate vs. etidronate. See 
also below (statistical methods). 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The two main efficacy trials 2304 and 2305 were carried out double-blinded and randomized. 
Standard tools (IVRS) and procedures were used. 
Statistical methods 
The  following  analysis  sets  were  defined:  ITT  (all  randomised),  MITT  (randomised  patients  with 
baseline and at least one post baseline SAP determination) Safety (all patients  who received at least 
one dose of study drug) and PP (exclusion of all major protocol violations). 
Missing data were handled as follows: 
For  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  therapeutic  response  and  the  proportion  who  achieved 
SAP normalisation, LOCF was used. No imputation was used for other efficacy parameters. 
According to the SAP, non-inferiority of zoledronic acid vs. risedronate could be concluded if a ∆ of 
greater than –0.16 (two-sided 95% CI) was observed. In addition, and as a pre-planned strategy to test 
superiority  of  zoledronic  acid,  between-treatment  difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
achieved therapeutic response at  six  months was evaluated by logistic regression  with treatment and 
baseline SAP (<3xULN or ≥3xULN) as explanatory variables 
A closed testing procedure was used for secondary efficacy claims (CTx at D10, SAP change at D28, 
SAP normalisation at D28, BPI-SF, time to first therapeutic response).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy data are given in the Table below. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion 
of patients who achieved therapeutic response at 6 months. A therapeutic response was defined as the 
normalization of SAP or a reduction of at least 75% from baseline (Visit 1) in SAP excess (difference 
between measured level and midpoint to the normal range).

The lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% CI for the difference between the treatment groups was greater 
than  –0.16  in  both  studies  2305  and  2304,  meeting  the  non-inferiority  criterion.  When  testing  for 
superiority,  the  lower  limit  of  the  CI  was  greater  than  0,  indicating  that  zoledronic  acid  had  a 
significantly higher proportion of patients who achieved therapeutic response compared to risedronate 
(20%  higher).  The  results  of  the  95%  CI  were  confirmed  by  the  statistically  significant  treatment 
effect in the logistic regression model from both studies (all p<0.001), and odds ratio of 7.13 (95% CI: 
2.56, 25.41) in Study 2305, and odds ratio of 10.37 (95% CI: 3.40, 45.21) in Study 2304. Consistent, 
statistically significant results were shown in the PP-population. 
The  relevant  variable  proportion  of  subjects  with  SAP  normalisation  was  tested  as  a  secondary 
variable  at  D28  (2305:  zoledronic  acid  0.09,  risedronate  0.01,  p<0.01;  2304:  zoledronic  acid0.06, 
risedronate 0, p<0.01).

Findings  for  serum  and  urine  CTx  (secondary  variables)  and  serum  P1NP  (exploratory)  were 
consistent with those for SAP. 
Time to first therapeutic response (secondary variable) was significantly shorter with zoledronic acid, 
compared with risedronate (62.7 vs. 108.2 days (ITT), risk ratio 3.31 [2.28;4.81]) in Study 2305 and 
(62.7 vs. 103.1 (ITT), risk ratio [2.54, 5.58]) in Study 2304. 
BPI-SF scores declined over time on study in both treatment arms in both trials, without significant 
differences or trends to superiority of zoledronic acid. In the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain 
severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and 
risedronate. 
Experience with retreatment is non-existent.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
• 
The pivotal clinical trials were performed essentially in accordance with CHMP scientific advice. The 
study samples are considered reasonably representative of the intended target population, although of 
mild to moderate average disease severity. Short-term efficacy on the accepted surrogate variable SAP 
is robust  with 95% response rate  for the primary  responder  criterion,  consistent  over subgroups  and 
corroborated  by  findings  for  other  bone  turnover  markers.  The  attainment  of  89%  response  rate  for 
SAP normalisation at six months is also reassuring, is significantly superior to what was achieved with 
the  approved  comparator  risedronate,  and  appears  to  be  considerably  in  excess  of  what  has  been 
published for other bisphonates.  
In the primary  efficacy  analysis (MITT), zoledronic acid  was  clearly  superior to risedronate in both 
trials (proportions of responders 2305: 0.95 vs.0.75; OR 7.13 [2.56; 25.41]; 2304: 0.97 vs. 0.73, OR 
10.37  [3.40;  45.2]).  This  was  consistent  in  PP  analysis.  Normalisation  of  SAP  at  six  months 
(exploratory) was noted in the proportions 0.89 vs. 0.56 and 0.89 vs. 0.60 in the two studies. Changes 
in SAP corroborated those for serum and urine CTx. Findings in subgroups (demographics, baseline 
disease severity, prior bisphosphonate exposure yes/no) were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Time to first therapeutic response was shorter with zoledronic acid, compared with risedronate in both 
trials.  
There was no difference between treatments regarding response in BPI-SF pain scores in either study.  
The lack of radiographic data is acknowledged as a deficiency, but such data has not been requested in 
other applications for this indication.  
Follow-up data in responders are currently being collected in extensions to both trials for patients who 
were  classified  as  therapeutic  responders  at  the  end  of  the  6-month  core  study.  Data  for  a  median 
follow-up of 18 months from time of dosing were made available in response to CHMP Day 120 List 
of Questions (D120 LOQ). In this analysis, 141/143 zoledronic acid-treated patients maintained their 
therapeutic response,  compared  with 71/107 of the risedronate-treated patients. Additional long-term 
data will be reported to the CHMP post-marketing. 
There is currently no actual experience of retreatment with zoledronic acid in PDB.  
Patient exposure 
Clinical safety 
• 
Taking  into  account  data  supplied  in  the  response  to  CHMP  D120  LOQ,  the  safety  assessment 
considered  data  obtained in  approximately 541 patients with PDB: 157 patients in  early-phase trials 
who received doses less than 5 mg zoledronic acid (24-400 µg), 177 patients in trial 2305 and 2304 
who received 5 mg of zoledronic acid, 172 patients who received the active  comparator, risedronate, 
and 35 patients in early phase studies who received placebo. 
Pooled  data  from  the  four  trials  in  the  target  population  constituted  the  major  safety  population. 
Further, post-marketing data for Zometa in oncology indications were taken into account.

Generally, the AE profile appears to be that expected with an IV bisphosphonate and also  consistent 
with  findings  in  other  trials  of  zoledronic  acid  in  benign  conditions  (0041,  0041E1,  2201). Flu-like 
symptoms,  headache  and  fatigue  frequently  occurred  within  the  first  3  days  of  administering 
zoledronic  acid.  The  majority  of  these  symptoms  resolved  within  4  days  of  the  event  onset.    A 
majority of the patients (95/177) in the zoledronic acid 5 mg group reported their adverse events in the 
first  3  days  after  initiating  study  drug.    Thereafter,  more  adverse  events  were  reported  in  the 
risedronate group.

Adverse events of special interest 
Renal adverse events 
Renal  abnormality  was  defined  as  a  serum  creatinine  rise  of  >  0.5  mg/dL  from  baseline,  or  a  >  2+ 
protein value by dip-stick. In the original submission, there were no events of raised serum creatinine 
at  D9-11  post  infusion  in  the  PDB  population  (protocol-defined  analysis)  and  only  one  episode  of 
transient, asymptomatic proteinuria. In study 2304 there were no renal adverse events associated with 
deterioration  of renal  function  or  renal  abnormalities  reported  for  zoledronic  acid.    For  risedronate, 
there were three adverse events that met the definition of deterioration of renal function. An overview 
of clinical renal AEs in the major safety population is given in the Table below.

Studies: 2304, 2305, 001, 002  
A subject with multiple occurrences within an AE is counted only once in the AE category. 
The two events reported with zoledronic acid 5 mg relate to one case of protocol-defined increase in 
serum  creatinine  occurring  at  six  months  post  administration,  and  one  case  of  urinary  retention, 
respectively. 
Available  data  in  the  PDB  population  create  no  specific  concern  regarding  renal  safety  of  IV 
zoledronic acid. Renal adverse events will be specifically monitored post-marketing. 
Upper gastrointestinal adverse events 
In the PDB safety database, there was no marked difference between zoledronic acid and risedronate 
regarding reporting rates for upper gastrointestinal AEs (18.6% and 16.3%, respectively).  
Uveitis/iritis/scleritis 
There were no reports of these events in the PDB population. 
Osteonecrosis of the maxillofacial region 
This has recently been  highlighted in the literature as  a complication  of pamidronate and zoledronic 
acid    when  used  in  oncology  indications.  No  events  of  this  type  are reported  in  the  current  dossier. 
Post-marketing surveillance is considered to be necessary. 
Bone safety 
Available data create no specific concerns (see section on Pharmacodynamics). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
• 
The  only  SAEs  assessed  as  potentially  related  involved  one  report  of  cerebrovascular  accident, 
occurring 69 days post administration of 5 mg zoledronic acid in study 2305, and one report of ECG 
changes 9 days following 100 µg of zoledronic acid in trial 002. 
SAEs  suspected  to  be  drug-related  in  other  completed  trials  in  benign  indications  included  isolated 
cases of flu-like symptoms.

Laboratory findings 
• 
Clinically  notable  hypocalcaemia  (serum  calcium  <1.87  mmol/l)  or  AE  of  hypocalcaemia  was 
reported in  8/177 patients in studies 2305 and 2304 following zoledronic acid 5 mg and with serum 
calcium  nadir  usually  occurring  before  or  by  D10  post  injection.  Truly  symptomatic  hypocalcaemia 
was  reported  in  two  patients,  both  of  which  showed  non-compliance  with  calcium  and  vitamin  D 
supplementation.

Safety in special populations 
• 
No specificities regarding the AE profile were noted in predefined subgroups or in relation to specific 
concomitant drug intake. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
• 
As  noted  in  the  section  on  pharmacokinetics,  the  potential  for  pharmacokinetic  drug  –  drug 
interactions is low. No specific dynamic interactions of concern are foreseen apart from those related 
to known class effects. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
• 
There  was  only  one  discontinuation  due  to  AE  in  the  major  safety  population.  Corresponding  data 
from the finalised trials in benign indications are unremarkable.  
Post marketing experience 
• 
The  data  available  refers  to  zoledronic  acid  as  Zometa,  indicated  in  oncology  patients.  As  already 
discussed, dosage regimens  for zoledronic acid and  co-morbidity spectrum are quite different in the 
oncology setting compared with for the currently sought indication. Apart from the recently identified 
issue  of  maxillofacial  osteonecrosis,  the  safety  experience  with  Zometa  is  not  considered  to  have 
raised unexpected concerns.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
• 
The main adverse effects of zoledronic acid by intravenous infusion are flu-like symptoms in the first 
3  days  following  administration.    These  symptoms  occur  very  commonly,  are  usually  transient  and 
resolve spontaneously within 2-4 days.  Bone pain, arthralgia, myalgia, fever, and hypocalcaemia have 
also  been  observed  commonly.    All  of  these  symptoms  have  been  reported  previously  with  other 
bisphosphonates.  
The  occurrence  of  symptomatic  hypocalcaemia  with  zoledronic  acid  despite  vitamin  D  and  calcium 
supplementation  created  concern  in  the  primary  assessment.  In  response  to  CHMP  D120  LOQ,  the 
applicant  provided  additional  data  and  discussion  on  this  issue.  In  the  pivotal  trials,  transient 
hypocalcaemia,  usually  with  the  nadir  at  or  before  D10  post  injection  was  noted  in  eight  patients 
treated  with  zoledronic  acid.  The  two  cases  with  the  lowest  serum  calcium  values  were  truly 
symptomatic and were associated with non-compliance with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. 
The  wording  in  the  SPC  of  sections  4.2  and  4.4  has  been  strengthened,  in  order  to  emphasise  the 
importance  of  adequate  calcium  supplementation  post  infusion;  this  approach  should  ensure 
manageable  safety  in  clinical  practice.  Hypocalcaemia  is  targeted  for  focused  surveillance  within 
PSURs.  
Based  on  preclinical  and  clinical  data,  there  is  a  concern  for  renal  toxicity  of  IV  bisphosphonates. 
Monitoring of renal function was performed 9-11 days following the initial dose in pivotal trials, and 
such monitoring is also specified per protocol in ongoing trials in non-malignant indications. No renal 
abnormalities  (increase  in  serum  creatinine  or  proteinuria  >2+)  occurred  due  to  zoledronic  acid 
infusion  in  the  PDB  population.  Due  to  the  concern  for  potential  renal  events,  individuals  with 
creatinine  clearance  below  30  ml/min  were  excluded  from  the  trials.  The  exclusion  of  patients  with 
severe  renal  impairment  has  been  reflected  in  the  SPC.  Renal  toxicity  is  targeted  for  focused 
surveillance within PSURs. 
Events  of  iritis/uveitis/scleritis  were  not  seen  in  the  PDB  population  so  far,  but  are,  appropriately, 
listed  in  the  SPC  as  occurring  with  bisphosphonate  therapy.  This  area  will  also  be  focused  on  in 
PSURs. 
limited  amount  of  (extralesional)  bone  safety  data  available  was  discussed 
The 
the 
pharmacodynamic section. Additional biopsy data from POP trials will be reported to the CHMP. The 
specific bone safety issue of maxillofacial osteonecrosis, highlighted for pamidronate and zoledronic 
acid  in  oncology  indications  has  so  far  not  been  reported  in  non-malignant  indications.  Targeted 
surveillance within PSURs is considered necessary.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit/Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that zoledronic acid  had 
inhibitory effects on osteoclasts inhibiting bone resorption and as well as reducing bone turnover. The 
general  safety  pharmacology  studies  showed  no  remarkable  effects.  The  pharmacokinetics  of 
zoledronic acid  has been studied in rat and  dog. The  findings  revealed in the toxicology programme 
have been adequately reflected in the SPC.  
Efficacy 
The  pivotal  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  CHMP  scientific  advice  and  in  an 
acceptable  sample  of  the  patient  population.  Short-term  efficacy  on  the  accepted  surrogate  variable 
SAP is robust. The attainment of replicated 89% response rate for SAP normalisation at six months is 
reassuring, is significantly superior  to  what  was achieved  with the approved  comparator risedronate, 
and also appears to be considerably in excess of what has been published for other bisphosphonates. 
Follow-up data are still preliminary, as regards to maintenance of long-term response. 
Safety 
The  updated  safety  database  has  been  adequately  presented.  Hypocalcaemia  appears  to  occur  more 
frequently  in  patients  receiving  i.v.  zoledronic  acid  compared  with  oral  risedronate,  even  if  usually 
mild  and  without  clinically  significant  consequences.  Hypocalcaemia  is  included  in  the  SPC  as  a 
common  side  effect  for  Aclasta.  Renal  adverse  events  and  osteonecrosis  of  the  maxillofacial  region 
will be specifically monitored post-marketing. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Aclasta (zoledronic acid) is the first i.v. bisphosphonate proposed for the treatment of Paget’s disease 
in  the  EU.  Zoledronic  acid  is  a  potent  bisphosphonate.  The  dose  claimed  is  poorly  substantiated. 
However, efficacy on usually accepted intermediary endpoints was demonstrated to be superior to that 
of  an  approved  regimen  of  oral  risedronate  in  two  adequate  clinical  trials,  and  the  safety  profile  is 
considered to be manageable within the restrictions imposed by the agreed SPC.  
Data  on  maintenance  of  effect  after  a  single  dose  are  preliminary.  The  available  data  on  long-term 
efficacy/safety and their limitations have been pointed out in the SPC. The Applicant intends to collect 
further data from the ongoing extension program in order to define these parameters.  These data will 
be reported to CHMP when the 2-year follow up data is available.   
Overall, and taking into account the  commitments to provision of additional efficacy and safety data 
post-marketing, the benefit/risk balance is acceptable. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by  a 
unanimous  decision that the benefit/risk ratio  of  Aclasta in the treatment  of Paget’s  disease  of bone 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

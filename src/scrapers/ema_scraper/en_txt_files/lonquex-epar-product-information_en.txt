CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Lonquex is indicated in adults and in children 2 years of age and older for reduction in the duration of 
neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy 
for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Lonquex treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology or 
haematology.

Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.6 ml solution in a single pre-filled syringe or vial) of Lonquex for 
each chemotherapy cycle, given approximately 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Children 2 years of age and older 
The recommended dose of Lonquex for paediatric patients is based on body weight according to the 
table below:  
Table 1: Recommended dose in children 2 years of age and older 
Body weight (kg)

4.0 mg (0.40 ml) 
6.0 mg (0.60 ml) 
For children weighing 45 kg or more Lonquex can be used as vial or pre-filled syringe presentation. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
In clinical studies with a limited number of elderly patients, there was no relevant age-related 
difference with regard to the efficacy or safety profiles of lipegfilgrastim. Therefore, no adjustment of 
the dose is necessary for elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Hepatic impairment 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Paediatric patients (children less than 2 years) 
The safety and efficacy of Lonquex in children below 2 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration 
The solution is to be injected subcutaneously (SC). The injection should be given into the abdomen, 
upper arm or thigh. 
Pre-filled syringe 
Self-administration of Lonquex should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, 
adequately trained and have access to expert advice. The first injection should be performed under 
direct medical supervision. 
For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. 
General 
The safety and efficacy of Lonquex have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose 
chemotherapy. Lonquex should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond 
established dose regimens. 
Allergic reactions and immunogenicity 
Patients who are hypersensitive to G-CSF or derivatives are also at risk of hypersensitivity reactions to 
lipegfilgrastim due to possible cross-reactivity. No lipegfilgrastim therapy should be commenced in 
these patients because of the risk of cross-reaction. 
Most biological medicinal products elicit some level of anti-drug antibody response. This antibody 
response can, in some cases, lead to undesirable effects or loss of efficacy. If a patient fails to respond 
to treatment, the patient should undergo further evaluation. 
If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy with close patient follow-up over several days 
should be administered. 
Haematopoietic system 
Treatment with lipegfilgrastim does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia caused by 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Lipegfilgrastim may also cause reversible thrombocytopenia (see 
section 4.8). Regular monitoring of the platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care 
should be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic medicinal products that 
are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. 
Leukocytosis may occur (see section 4.8). No adverse events directly attributable to leukocytosis have 
been reported. Elevation in white blood cells (WBC) is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects 
of lipegfilgrastim. A WBC count should be performed at regular intervals during therapy owing to the 
clinical effects of lipegfilgrastim and the potential for leukocytosis. If WBC counts exceed 50 x 109/l 
after the expected nadir, lipegfilgrastim should be discontinued immediately. 
Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been 
associated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting 
bone-imaging results. 
Patients with myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes 
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells and some non-myeloid 
cells in vitro. 
The safety and efficacy of Lonquex have not been investigated in patients with chronic myeloid 
leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia; it should therefore not 
be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast 
transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia in breast and lung cancer patients 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an observational post-marketing study, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) were associated with the use of pegfilgrastim, an alternative G-CSF, in combination 
with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in breast and lung cancer patients. A similar association is not 
known between lipegfilgrastim and MDS/AML. Nevertheless, patients with breast cancer and patients 
with lung cancer should be monitored for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. 
Splenic adverse reactions 
Generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly have been reported after administration of 
lipegfilgrastim (see section 4.8) and infrequent cases of splenic rupture, including fatal cases, have 
been reported after administration of G-CSF or derivatives (see section 4.8). Spleen size should 
therefore be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture 
should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. 
Pulmonary adverse reactions 
Pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after 
administration of lipegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Patients with a recent history of pulmonary 
infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. 
The onset of pulmonary symptoms such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological 
signs of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function together with an increased 
neutrophil count may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (see 
section 4.8). In such circumstances Lonquex should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician 
and appropriate treatment given. 
Vascular adverse reactions 
Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after administration of G-CSF or derivatives and is 
characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who 
develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard 
symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). 
Aortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The 
symptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory 
markers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by 
CT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. 
Patients with sickle cell anaemia 
Sickle cell crisis has been associated with the use of G-CSF or derivatives in patients with sickle cell 
anaemia (see section 4.8). Physicians should therefore exercise caution when administering Lonquex 
in patients with sickle cell anaemia, monitor appropriate clinical parameters and laboratory results and 
be attentive to the possible association of lipegfilgrastim with splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive 
crisis. 
Hypokalaemia 
Hypokalaemia may occur (see section 4.8). For patients with increased risk on hypokalaemia due to 
underling disease or co-medications, it is recommended to monitor the serum potassium level carefully 
and to substitute potassium if necessary. 
Glomerulonephritis 
Glomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim. 
Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim, 
lenograstim or pegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended (see section 4.8).

Excipients 
This medicinal product contains sorbitol. The additive effect of concomitantly administered products 
containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into 
account. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe or vial, i.e. 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, Lonquex 
should be administered approximately 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Concomitant use of lipegfilgrastim with any chemotherapeutic medicinal product has not been 
evaluated in patients. In animal models, concomitant administration of G-CSF and 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU) or other antimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression. 
The safety and efficacy of Lonquex have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy 
associated with delayed myelosuppression, e.g. nitrosoureas. 
The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been 
specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are very limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) on the use of lipegfilgrastim in 
pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lonquex during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lipegfilgrastim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed 
child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Lonquex. 
Fertility 
No data are available. Animal studies with G-CSF and derivatives do not indicate harmful effects with 
respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lonquex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent undesirable effects are musculoskeletal pain and nausea. 
Capillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported 
mostly in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy after administration of G-CSF or derivatives (see 
section 4.4 and section 4.8).

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of lipegfilgrastim has been evaluated based on results from clinical studies including 
506 patients and 76 healthy volunteers treated at least once with lipegfilgrastim. 
The adverse reactions listed below in table 2 are classified according to system organ class. Frequency 
groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 
to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare (<1/10 000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis have been reported (see section 4.4). 
Splenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, has been reported (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic skin reactions, urticaria, angioedema and serious allergic 
reactions may occur. 
Hypokalaemia has been reported (see section 4.4). 
Pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported (see section 4.4). 
These pulmonary adverse reactions may also include pulmonary oedema, pulmonary infiltrates, 
pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory failure or ARDS (see section 4.4). 
Nausea was very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. 
Skin reactions such as erythema and rash may occur. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Injection site reactions such as injection site induration and injection site pain may occur. 
The most frequent adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pains such as bone pain and myalgia. 
Musculoskeletal pain is generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and can be controlled in most 
patients with standard analgesics. However cases of severe musculoskeletal pain (mainly bone pain 
and back pain) have been reported, including cases that led to hospitalisation. 
Reversible, mild to moderate elevations in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase may occur, 
with no associated clinical effects. Elevations in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase most 
likely originate from the increase in neutrophils. 
Certain adverse reactions have not yet been observed with lipegfilgrastim, but are generally accepted 
as being attributable to G-CSF and derivatives: 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
- 
- 
Splenic rupture including some fatal cases (see section 4.4) 
Sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell anaemia (see section 4.4) 
Vascular disorders 
- 
Capillary leak syndrome 
Cases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in post marketing experience after 
administration of G-CSF or derivatives. These have generally occurred in patients suffering 
from advanced malignant diseases, having sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal 
products or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). 
Aortitis (see section 4.4) 
- 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
- 
- 
Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet’s syndrome) 
Cutaneous vasculitis 
Renal and urinary disorders 
- 
Glomerulonephritis (see section 4.4) 
Paediatric population 
The safety assessment in paediatric patients is limited to the clinical study data from the following 
studies: 
- 
a phase I study with 21 paediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years with Ewing family of tumours or 
rhabdomyosarcoma receiving lipegfilgrastim after a single cycle of chemotherapy (see also 
section 5.1) 
a phase II study with 21 paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years with Ewing family of tumours or 
rhabdomyosarcoma receiving one dose of lipegfilgrastim per chemotherapy cycle, for 4 
consecutive cycles (see also section 5.1). 
- 
Overall, the safety profile in paediatric patients appeared similar to that observed in adult clinical 
studies. Some blood and lymphatic system disorders (anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting) were observed with a higher frequency in paediatric patients than 
those in adult clinical studies (see also section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no experience with overdose of lipegfilgrastim. In the case of overdose, WBC and platelet 
count should be performed regularly and spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical 
examination, ultrasound).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC code: L03AA14 
Mechanism of action 
Lipegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim with a single methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
molecule via a carbohydrate linker consisting of glycine, N-acetylneuraminic acid and 
N-acetylgalactosamine. The average molecular mass is approximately 39 kDa of which the protein 
moiety constitutes approximately 48 %. Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that regulates the production 
and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. Filgrastim is an un-glycosylated 
recombinant methionyl human G-CSF. Lipegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due 
to decreased renal clearance. Lipegfilgrastim binds to human the G-CSF receptor like filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim induced a marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 
24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes. These results suggest that the 
G-CSF moiety of lipegfilgrastim confers the expected activity of this growth factor: stimulation of 
proliferation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, differentiation into mature cells and release into the 
peripheral blood. This effect includes not only the neutrophil lineage but extends to other single 
lineage and multilineage progenitors and pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells. G-CSF also increases 
the antibacterial activities of neutrophils including the phagocytosis. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Once-per-cycle dosing of lipegfilgrastim was investigated in two pivotal randomised, double-blind 
clinical studies in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. 
The first pivotal (phase III) clinical study XM22-03 was an active-controlled study in 202 patients 
with stage II-IV breast cancer receiving up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and 
docetaxel. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive 6 mg lipegfilgrastim or 6 mg pegfilgrastim. The 
study showed non-inferiority of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim to 6 mg pegfilgrastim for the primary endpoint, 
duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in the first cycle of chemotherapy (see table 3).

The second pivotal (phase III) clinical study XM22-04 was a placebo-controlled study in 375 patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer receiving up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and 
etoposide. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either 6 mg lipegfilgrastim or placebo. The results 
of the study are presented in table 4. When the main study was finalised, the incidence of death was 
7.2 % (placebo) and 12.5 % (6 mg lipegfilgrastim) although after the 360-day follow-up period the 
overall incidence of death was similar between placebo and lipegfilgrastim (44.8 % and 44.0 %; safety 
population).

A post-authorisation safety study XM22-ONC-40041 was conducted to collect data of disease 
progression and mortality in patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous cell lung cancer 
receiving lipegfilgrastim in addition to the platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased risk of disease 
progression or death was not observed with lipegfilgrastim.  
Immunogenicity 
An analysis of anti-drug antibodies of 579 patients and healthy volunteers treated with lipegfilgrastim, 
188 patients and healthy volunteers treated with pegfilgrastim and 121 patients treated with placebo 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was performed. Drug-specific antibodies emerging after start of treatment were detected in 0.86 % of 
the subjects receiving lipegfilgrastim, in 1.06 % of the subjects receiving pegfilgrastim and in 1.65 % 
of the subjects receiving placebo. No neutralising antibodies against lipegfilgrastim were observed. 
Paediatric population 
Two clinical studies (XM22-07 and XM22-08) were conducted in paediatric populations using 
lipegfilgrastim for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. In both studies, lipegfilgrastim was supplied in glass vials 
containing 10 mg of lipegfilgrastim in a 1 ml solution for subcutaneous injection. 
In the phase I study (XM22-07), 21 children aged between 2 and 16 years with Ewing family of 
tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma received lipegfilgrastim as a single subcutaneous dose of 100 μg/kg 
(up to a maximum of 6 mg, which is the fixed dose for adults) 24 hours after the end of the last 
chemotherapy treatment in week 1 of the regimen. The chemotherapy regimens consisted of: 
vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide (VIDE); vincristine, actinomycin D and 
cyclophosphamide (VAC); or ifosfamide, vincristine, and actinomycin D (IVA). The incidence of FN 
varied according to age (from 14.3 % to 71.4 %), with the highest frequency in the oldest age group. 
The use of three different chemotherapy regimens, with varying myelosuppressive effects and age 
distributions, complicated the comparison of efficacy across age groups. 
In the phase II study (XM22-08), 42 children aged between 2 and < 18 years with Ewing family of 
tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma received for 4 consecutive chemotherapy cycles in a randomised 
1:1 ratio either lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 100 μg/kg (up to a maximum of 6 mg, 1 dose per cycle) or 
filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg (once daily for at least 5 consecutive days per cycle [maximum of 
14 days]). The chemotherapy regimens consisted of: VIDE; VAC; IVA; vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (VDC/IE); or ifosfamide, vincristine, 
actinomycin D and doxorubicin (IVADo). The primary endpoint was the duration of severe 
neutropenia (DSN) in cycle 1. DSN (mean [standard deviation]) in cycle 1 was 2.7 (2.25) days in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 2.5 (2.09) days in the filgrastim group (Per Protocol [PP] Analysis set). The 
overall incidence of febrile neutropenia was 35 % in the lipegfilgrastim group and 42% in the 
filgrastim group (PP Analysis Set). The study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing. 
Therefore, results from this study should be interpreted with caution. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
General 
Healthy volunteers 
In 3 studies (XM22-01, XM22-05, XM22-06) in healthy volunteers, the maximum blood 
concentration was reached after a median of 30 to 36 hours and the average terminal half-life ranged 
from approximately 32 to 62 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim. 
After subcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim at three different sites (upper arm, abdomen and 
thigh) in healthy volunteers, the bioavailability (peak concentration and area under the curve [AUC]) 
was lower after subcutaneous injection in the thigh compared to subcutaneous injection in the 
abdomen and in the upper arm. In this limited study XM22-06, bioavailability of lipegfilgrastim and 
observed differences among the injection sites were higher in male subjects compared to female 
subjects. Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic effects were similar and independent from gender and 
injection site. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolism 
Lipegfilgrastim is metabolised via intra- or extracellular degradation by proteolytic enzymes. 
Lipegfilgrastim is internalised by neutrophils (non-linear process), then degraded within the cell by 
endogenous proteolytic enzymes. The linear pathway is likely due to extracellular protein degradation 
by neutrophil elastase and other plasma proteases. 
Drug interactions 
In vitro data indicate that lipegfilgrastim is has little or no direct or immune system-mediated effects on 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 activity. Therefore, lipegfilgrastim 
is not likely to affect metabolism via human cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Special populations 
Cancer patients 
In 2 studies (XM22-02 and XM22-03) in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy 
consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, mean maximum blood concentrations of 227 and 262 ng/ml 
were reached after median times to maximum concentration (tmax) of 44 and 48 hours. The mean 
terminal half-lives were approximately 29 and 31 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg 
lipegfilgrastim during the first cycle of chemotherapy. After a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg 
lipegfilgrastim during the fourth cycle, the maximum blood concentrations were lower than observed 
in the first cycle (mean values 77 and 111 ng/ml) and were reached after median tmax of 8 hours. The 
mean terminal half-lives in the fourth cycle were approximately 39 and 42 hours. 
In a study (XM22-04) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving chemotherapy consisting 
of cisplatin and etoposide, the mean maximum blood concentration of 317 ng/ml was reached after a 
median tmax of 24 hours and the mean terminal half-life was approximately 28 hours after a single 
subcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim during the first cycle of chemotherapy. After a single 
subcutaneous injection of 6 mg lipegfilgrastim during the fourth cycle, the mean maximum blood 
concentration of 149 ng/ml was reached after a median tmax of 8 hours and the mean terminal half-life 
was approximately 34 hours. 
Lipegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, which becomes 
saturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum 
concentration of lipegfilgrastim declines slowly during the chemotherapy-induced transient neutrophil 
nadir and rapidly at the following onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1).

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
Due to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of lipegfilgrastim is not 
expected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. 
Elderly patients 
Limited patient data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of lipegfilgrastim in elderly patients 
(65 - 74 years) is similar to that in younger patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients 
≥ 75 years. 
Paediatric population  
In a phase I study (see section 5.1) the geometric mean maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) were 
243 ng/ml in the 2 to < 6-year group, 255 ng/ml in the 6 to < 12-year group and 224 ng/ml in the 12 to 
< 18-year group after a single subcutaneous injection of 100 μg/kg (maximum 6 mg) lipegfilgrastim 
with the first cycle of chemotherapy. The maximum blood concentrations were reached after a median 
time (tmax) of 23.9 hours, 30.0 hours and 95.8 hours, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling of paediatric data (aged 2 to < 18 years 
with administered doses of 100 µg/kg), including additional data from the phase II study (see section 
5.1) and combined with previous adult PK data, support that comparable lipegfilgrastim serum 
exposures were achieved in paediatric patients as compared to adult patients, and that PK and PD 
parameters were comparable across the paediatric weight bands studied and support the dose 
recommendation by body weight ranges for paediatric patients. 
Overweight patients 
A trend towards a decrease in lipegfilgrastim exposure was observed with increase in weight. This 
may result in lowered pharmacodynamic responses in heavy patients (> 95 kg). Consequent decrease 
in efficacy in these patients cannot be excluded on current data. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
13 
 
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance. 
In a study of toxicity to reproduction and development in rabbits, an increased incidence of 
post-implantation loss and abortion has been observed at high doses of lipegfilgrastim, likely owing to 
an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect specific for rabbits. There is no evidence that lipegfilgrastim 
is teratogenic. These findings are consistent with results from G-CSF and derivatives. Published 
information on G-CSF and derivatives reveal no evidence of adverse effects on fertility and 
embryo-foetal development in rats or pre-/postnatal effects other than those related to maternal 
toxicity as well. There is evidence that filgrastim and pegfilgrastim may be transported at low levels 
over the placenta in rats, although no information is available for lipegfilgrastim. The relevance of 
these findings for humans is not known.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lonquex is and what it is used for 
What Lonquex is 
Lonquex contains the active substance lipegfilgrastim. Lipegfilgrastim is a long-acting modified 
protein produced by biotechnology in bacteria called Escherichia coli. It belongs to a group of proteins 
called cytokines and is similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) 
produced by your own body. 
What Lonquex is used for 
Lonquex is used in adults and in children aged 2 years and older. 
Your doctor has prescribed Lonquex for you or for your child in order to reduce the duration of a 
condition called neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia 
(low white blood cell count with a fever). These can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(medicines that destroy rapidly-growing cells). 
How Lonquex works 
Lipegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to produce 
more white blood cells. White blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. These 
cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in 
your body to decrease. If white blood cells fall to a low level, there may not be enough left in the body 
to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lonquex 
Do not use Lonquex 
• 
if you or your child are allergic to lipegfilgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lonquex: 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you or your child get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. It could be 
a consequence of a spleen disorder (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
if you or your child have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. It could be a consequence of a 
pulmonary disorder (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
if you or your child have sickle cell anaemia, which is an inherited disease characterised by 
sickle-shaped red blood cells. 
if you or your child have previously experienced allergic reactions to other medicines like this 
one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). There could be a risk 
of reacting to Lonquex too. 
Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests in order to monitor various blood components and their 
levels. Your doctor will also check your or your child`s urine regularly as other medicines similar to 
this one (e.g. other granulocyte colony stimulating factors such as filgrastim, lenograstim or 
pegfilgrastim) can possibly harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see section 4 
“Possible side effects”). 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are being treated for breast or lung cancer in combination 
with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and experience symptoms such as tiredness, fever, 
and easy bruising or bleeding. These symptoms could be a consequence of a precancerous blood 
condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or of a blood cancer called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) which have been associated with another medicine like this one (pegfilgrastim 
of the group of G-CSFs). 
Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) 
has been reported rarely with other medicines like this one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or 
pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, 
back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. 
Children and adolescents 
Lonquex is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age. 
Other medicines and Lonquex 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Lonquex has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as the doctor may decide that you should 
not use this medicine. 
It is unknown whether the active substance in this medicine passes into the breast milk. You should 
therefore interrupt breast-feeding during treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Lonquex has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
Lonquex contains sorbitol 
This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe. 
Lonquex contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Lonquex 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
What the recommended dose is 
The recommended dose is one pre-filled syringe (6 mg lipegfilgrastim) once per chemotherapy cycle. 
The pre-filled syringe is only suitable for adults or for children weighing 45 kg and more. 
Lonquex is also available in a vial presentation for children weighing less than 45 kg. The 
recommended dose will be based on their body weight and the adequate dose will be given by a doctor 
or a nurse. 
When to use Lonquex 
The Lonquex dose will normally be injected approximately 24 hours after the last dose of 
chemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. 
How are the injections given? 
This medicine is given as an injection using a pre-filled syringe. The injection is given into the tissue 
just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
Your doctor may suggest that you learn how to inject yourself with this medicine or how to give the 
injection to your child. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this. Do not 
attempt to give Lonquex to yourself or to your child without this training. Information required for 
using the pre-filled syringe can be found under “Information for injecting yourself or your child”. 
Proper treatment of your or of your child´s disease, however, requires close and constant co-operation 
with your doctor. 
Information for injecting yourself or your child 
This section contains information on how to give yourself or your child an injection of Lonquex under 
the skin. It is important that you do not try to give yourself or your child the injection unless you have 
received special training from your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself or your 
child the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. 
How Lonquex is used 
You will need to give yourself or your child the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is 
known as a subcutaneous injection. 
Equipment that you need 
To give yourself or your child an injection into the tissue under the skin you will need: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a pre-filled syringe of Lonquex, 
an alcohol wipe, 
a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab, 
a puncture-proof container (plastic container provided by the hospital or pharmacy) so you can 
dispose of used syringes safely. 
What you should do before the injection 
1. 
2. 
Take the medicine out of the refrigerator. 
Open the blister and take the pre-filled syringe out of the blister (see picture 1). Do not pick up 
the pre-filled syringe by the plunger or needle cover. 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed 
the last day of the month shown. 
Check the appearance of Lonquex. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles 
in it or if it is cloudy, you must not use it. 
Do not shake Lonquex vigorously as this may affect its activity. 
For a more comfortable injection:  
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room temperature (not above 
25 °C) or 
hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. 
7. 
8. 
Do not warm Lonquex in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot 
water). 
Do not remove the needle cover from the syringe until you are ready to inject. 
Find a comfortable, well-lit place. Put everything you need within easy reach (the Lonquex 
pre-filled syringe, an alcohol wipe, a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab and the 
puncture-proof container). 
9.  Wash your hands thoroughly. 
1 
Where the injection should be given 
The most suitable places for the injection are: 
• 
• 
the top of the thighs, 
the abdomen (see grey areas in picture 2) avoiding the skin directly surrounding the navel. 
2 
If someone else is injecting you or if you are injecting your child, the following places can also be 
used: 
• 
the back and side of the upper arms (see grey areas in pictures 3 and 4).

How to prepare for the injection 
Before you give yourself or your child a Lonquex injection, you must do the following: 
1. 
2. 
Disinfect the injection site on the skin by using an alcohol wipe. 
Hold the syringe and gently remove the cover from the needle without twisting. Pull straight as 
shown in pictures 5 and 6. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. 
5 
6 
3. 
You may notice small air bubbles in the pre-filled syringe. If there are air bubbles present, hold 
the syringe with the needle pointing upwards (see picture 7), gently tap the syringe with your 
fingers until the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. With the syringe pointing upwards, 
expel all air from the syringe by pushing the plunger slowly upwards. 
4. 
You can now use the pre-filled syringe. 
7 
How you should inject yourself or your child 
1. 
Pinch the disinfected skin between your thumb and forefinger, without squeezing it (see 
picture 8). 
Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your doctor or nurse. The angle between the 
syringe and skin should not be too narrow (at least 45°, see picture 9). 
Inject the liquid into the tissue slowly and evenly, always keeping the skin pinched. 
After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of the skin. 
Press the injection site with a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab for several 
seconds. 
Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not use any Lonquex that is left in the syringe.

• 
• 
Do not put the cover back on used needles. 
Put used syringes into the puncture-proof container and keep this container out of the sight and 
reach of children. 
Dispose of the full puncture-proof container as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Never put the syringes that you have used into your normal household rubbish bin.

Information for injecting yourself or your child 
This section contains information on how to give yourself or your child an injection of Lonquex under 
the skin. It is important that you do not try to give yourself or your child the injection unless you have 
received special training from your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself the 
injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. 
How Lonquex is used 
You will need to give yourself or your child the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is 
known as a subcutaneous injection. 
Equipment that you need 
To give yourself or your child an injection into the tissue under the skin you will need: 
• 
• 
• 
a pre-filled syringe of Lonquex, 
an alcohol wipe, 
a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab. 
What you should do before the injection 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
Take the medicine out of the refrigerator. 
Open the blister and take the pre-filled syringe out of the blister (see picture 1). Do not pick up 
the pre-filled syringe by the plunger or needle cover. This could damage the safety device. 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed 
the last day of the month shown. 
Check the appearance of Lonquex. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles 
in it or if it is cloudy, you must not use it. 
Do not shake Lonquex vigorously as this may affect its activity.  
For a more comfortable injection: 
• 
• 
let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room temperature (not above  
25 °C) or  
hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. 
Do not warm Lonquex in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot 
water). 
Do not remove the needle cover from the syringe until you are ready to inject. 
Find a comfortable, well-lit place. Put everything you need within easy reach (the Lonquex 
pre-filled syringe, an alcohol wipe and a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.  Wash your hands thoroughly.

Where the injection should be given 
The most suitable places for the injection are: 
• 
• 
the top of the thighs, 
the abdomen (see grey areas in picture 2) avoiding the skin directly surrounding the navel. 
2 
If someone else is injecting you or if you are injecting your child, the following places can also be 
used: 
• 
the back and side of the upper arms (see grey areas in pictures 3 and 4).

the way down, remove the needle from the skin (see picture 11). Then release the plunger. The 
safety device will be activated immediately. The entire needle and syringe will be drawn back 
automatically and covered so that you cannot prick yourself (see picture 12). 
Press the injection site with a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab for several 
seconds. 
Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
• 
Allergic reactions such as skin rash, raised itchy areas of skin and serious allergic reactions with 
weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing and swelling of the face have been 
reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If you think you are having this type 
of reaction, you must stop your Lonquex injection and get medical help immediately. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Increased spleen size has been reported uncommonly  and cases of splenic ruptures have been 
reported with other medicines similar to Lonquex. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. It is 
important to contact your doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the 
abdomen or left shoulder pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen. 
Cough, fever and difficult or painful breathing can be signs of uncommon  serious pulmonary 
side effects, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may be fatal. If 
you have a fever or any of these symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor immediately.  
It is important to contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms: 
swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty 
breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These 
symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. 
These could be symptoms of a condition reported with frequency not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data), called “capillary leak syndrome”, which causes blood to leak 
from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. 
Other side effects 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
• 
Musculoskeletal pains such as bone pain and pain in the joints, muscles, limbs, chest, neck or 
back. Tell your doctor if you experience severe musculoskeletal pain. 
Nausea.

How to store Lonquex 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lonquex is and what it is used for 
What Lonquex is 
Lonquex contains the active substance lipegfilgrastim. Lipegfilgrastim is a long-acting modified 
protein produced by biotechnology in bacteria called Escherichia coli. It belongs to a group of proteins 
called cytokines and is similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) 
produced by your own body. 
What Lonquex is used for 
Lonquex is used in adults and in children aged 2 years and older. 
Your doctor has prescribed Lonquex for you or for your child in order to reduce the duration of a 
condition called neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia 
(low white blood cell count with a fever). These can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(medicines that destroy rapidly-growing cells). 
How Lonquex works 
Lipegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to produce 
more white blood cells. White blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. These 
cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in 
your body to decrease. If white blood cells fall to a low level, there may not be enough left in the body 
to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. 
2.  What you need to know before Lonquex is given 
Lonquex must not be used 
• 
if you or your child are allergic to lipegfilgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lonquex: 
• 
if you or your child get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. It could be 
a consequence of a spleen disorder (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
if you or your child have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. It could be a consequence of a 
pulmonary disorder (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
if you or your child have sickle cell anaemia, which is an inherited disease characterised by 
sickle-shaped red blood cells. 
if you or your child have previously experienced allergic reactions to other medicines like this 
one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). There could be a risk 
of reacting to Lonquex too. 
Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests in order to monitor various blood components and their 
levels. Your doctor will also check your or your child`s urine regularly as other medicines similar to 
this one (e.g. other granulocyte colony stimulating factors such as filgrastim, lenograstim or 
pegfilgrastim) can possibly harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see section 4 
“Possible side effects”). 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are being treated for breast or lung cancer in combination 
with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and experience symptoms such as tiredness, fever, 
and easy bruising or bleeding. These symptoms could be a consequence of a precancerous blood 
condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or of a blood cancer called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) which have been associated with another medicine like this one (pegfilgrastim 
of the group of G-CSFs). 
Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) 
has been reported rarely with other medicines like this one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or 
pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, 
back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. 
Children and adolescents 
Lonquex is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age. 
Other medicines and Lonquex 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Lonquex has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as the doctor may decide that you should 
not use this medicine. 
It is unknown whether the active substance in this medicine passes into the breast milk. You should 
therefore interrupt breast-feeding during treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Lonquex has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
Lonquex contains sorbitol 
This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each vial. 
Lonquex contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How Lonquex is given 
Lonquex is normally given by a doctor or a nurse. The injection is given into the tissue just under the 
skin (subcutaneous injection). 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What the recommended dose is 
The recommended dose for adults is 6 mg (one 0.6 ml vial) once per chemotherapy cycle. 
The recommended dose for children and adolescents is based on their body weight: 
Body weight (kg) 
< 10 
≥ 10 to < 20 
≥ 20 to < 30 
≥ 30 to < 45 
≥ 45 
Dose (once per chemotherapy cycle) 
0.6 mg (0.06 ml) 
1.5 mg (0.15 ml) 
2.5 mg (0.25 ml) 
4.0 mg (0.40 ml) 
6.0 mg (0.60 ml) 
Lonquex is also available as a 6 mg pre-filled syringe for adults and any children weighing 45 kg and 
more. 
When will Lonquex be given 
The Lonquex dose will normally be injected approximately 24 hours after the last dose of 
chemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: 
Storage and inspection 
Store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the outer carton, in order to protect 
from light. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The solution should be allowed to reach a comfortable temperature (15 °C – 25 °C) before the 
injection. 
Once removed from the refrigerator Lonquex may be stored below 25 °C for a maximum single period 
of up to 7 days. 
The solution should be visually inspected before use. Only clear, colourless solutions without particles 
should be used. 
Vigorous shaking should be avoided. Excessive shaking may aggregate lipegfilgrastim, rendering it 
biologically inactive. 
Method of administration 
The recommended dose is to be injected subcutaneously (SC) using an appropriate syringe with 
adequate graduation for the prescribed dose. 
The injection should be given into the abdomen, upper arm or thigh. 
Lonquex is for single use only. Unused portions of each vial must be discarded properly. Do not save 
any unused portions for later administration. 
Lonquex must not be mixed with other medicinal products. 
Procedure for proper disposal

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pregabalin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on risk of respiratory depression from spontaneous reports and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pregabalin and 
respiratory depression is established and concluded that the product information of products containing 
pregabalin should be amended accordingly.  
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning regarding respiratory depression related to 
pregabalin in patients without concomitant use of opioids and/or other CNS depressants and without 
risk factors as well in the setting of risk factors such as underlying respiratory impairment and/or use 
of CNS depressants.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pregabalin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pregabalin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

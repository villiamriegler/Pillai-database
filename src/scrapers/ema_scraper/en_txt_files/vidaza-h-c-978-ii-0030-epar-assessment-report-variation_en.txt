2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
The disease - AML 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive, clonal myeloid neoplasm with maturation arrest of 
myelopoiesis, leading to an accumulation of myoblasts in bone marrow (BM) and/or blood. AML is the 
most frequent form of leukaemia, accounting for approximately 25% of all leukaemias in adults in the 
Western world (Deschler, 2006a). Worldwide, the incidence of AML is the highest in the United States 
(US), Australia and Western Europe (Redaelli, 2003). The overall annual crude incidence of AML is 3.7 
per 100,0000 people (Visser, 2012). More than half of the subjects with newly diagnosed AML in 
developed countries are over 65 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis of 67 (Colita, 2011; 
Pollyea, 2011; Smith, 2011).  
Assessment report

AML can arise de novo, through transformation of existing myelodysplasia, or be secondary to 
previous therapy (e.g. cytotoxic chemotherapy). AML is a heterogeneous disease in terms of 
response to treatment and overall survival (OS). Prognostic factors that contribute to this 
heterogeneity can be both patient- and disease-related. Patient-related prognostic factors include 
age, performance score and comorbidities. Disease-related prognostic factors include high leukocyte 
count, existence of prior MDS or myelodysplasia-related changes, previous cytotoxic therapy, and 
cytogenetic and molecular/genetic changes in the leukaemic cells at diagnosis. Overall, the 5-year 
survival rate for AML is 19%, whereas for elderly only 5% of the patients achieve a 5-year survival 
(Visser, 2012). 
The treatment – AML in the elderly 
Intensive (induction) chemotherapy 
Since the 1970s, the standard initial therapy for patients with AML has consisted of intensive 
chemotherapy with 7 days of continuous infusion with cytarabine and 3 days with an anthracycline 
drug (the so-called “7+3” regimen). Published data confirm that also the median overall survival of 
older patients (median age 70 years) with AML treated with intensive induction therapy was 
significantly longer (30 weeks) than patients treated with low-intensity therapy (12 weeks) or best 
supportive care (Deschler, 2006b). However, older patients with AML are more likely to have more 
numerous and severe comorbidities, contributing to more frequent treatment-related morbidity and 
mortality (Buchner, 2009; Kantarjian, 2006). Therefore, in clinical practice selection of the 
appropriate therapeutic approach for the older AML patient is based on patient-specific factors (i.e. 
his/her “fitness” for chemotherapy) and biological markers of disease predictive of response to 
various therapeutic interventions. In this respect, the one factor most consistently aligning with 
clinical outcome after intensive chemotherapy is karyotype in young and elderly patients (Kantarjian, 
2006; Krug, 2010; Malfuson, 2008). Older patients with AML characterized by favourable- or 
intermediate-risk (non-adverse) karyotype have complete remission (CR) rates up to 60% after 
cytarabine- and anthracycline-based therapy. In contrast, older patients with AML associated with 
adverse karyotype have remission rates as low as 20%, with an overall survival of 2-3 months 
(Kantarjian, 2006). (For further reading be referred to the recent review of Wang (Hematology Am 
Soc Hematol Educ Program, 2014).) 
Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)  
Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered the most effective therapy for 
addressing resistance in AML. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and the use of donors 
other than HLA-matched siblings have made HSCT feasible in many older patients. However, there is 
a lack of knowledge about the relative benefit of HSCT over conventional chemotherapy implying a 
need for standardized means to help physicians decide which older patients should receive intensive 
initial chemotherapy and which should subsequently be treated with (RIC-)HSCT (Menzin, 2002; 
Oran, 2012). Current data from the Centre for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research 
(CIBMTR) show that 30% of AML patients > 75 years of age survive for 3 years after allogeneic HSCT 
(Sorror and Estey, Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program, 2014). 
Low-dose cytarabine 
Low-dose cytarabine (also known as low-dose Ara-C or LDAC) has been used as a low-intensity 
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of elderly, “unfit” AML patients for several decades. Recent 
studies have highlighted the fact that even very small doses of cytarabine (typically given at 20 
mg/m2 administered once or twice daily for 10-14 days per month) can induce CRs in ≈ 8%-18% of 
patients with AML and can prolong survival (Burnett, 2007; Fenaux, 2010; Kantarjian, 2012). 
Although these results compare favourably with no remission after hydroxyurea and supportive care, 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 7/74 
 
  
  
LDAC is currently considered potentially inferior to other upfront therapies for older patients with 
AML, in part because no patients with AML with adverse cytogenetic findings achieve remission with 
this regimen (Burnett, 2007). Despite this fact, LDAC may still be a therapeutic option for geriatric 
patients with favourable or intermediate risk karyotype AML whose medical issues (such as renal 
insufficiency) preclude the administration of intensive chemotherapy and who prefer to 
self-administer drug almost exclusively at home without the need for daily clinic visits or inpatient 
hospitalization. 
Hypomethylating therapy 
Over the last several years, hypomethylating therapy with 1 of 2 agents, decitabine and azacitidine, 
has been increasingly used in place of standard intensive chemotherapy for the treatment of “unfit” 
elderly patients with AML. Recent studies suggest that, although hypomethylating therapy in AML 
patients results in lower CR rates (10%-20%) than conventional intensive chemotherapy, an 
additional 10%-30% of these individuals nevertheless exhibit evidence of some disease response or 
stabilization and have overall survival rates equivalent or superior to other conventional treatments 
(Kantarjian, 2012; Quintas-Cardama, 2012). Furthermore, hypomethylating therapy was reported to 
be well tolerated over long periods of time in unfit elderly individuals, with fewer required hospital 
days and RBC and platelet transfusions (van der Helm, 2013; Ritchie, 2013). To date, the question of 
which older patients with AML benefit from intensive versus hypomethylating therapy has been 
addressed only in retrospective analyses. 
Post-remission therapy for older AML patients  
The best therapeutic option for older patients with AML after achievement of CR with upfront therapy 
remains uncertain. Individuals up to the age of 75 years who achieve sufficient disease control after 
upfront AML therapy and have few comorbidities should be considered for consolidation with 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), ideally with reduced intensity conditioning regimens, 
because this remains the only potential curative therapeutic option for these patients. 
For those individuals in remission who are not eligible for alloSCT, the standard approach has been to 
administer “consolidation” chemotherapy consisting of lower doses of the same agents used in 
induction therapy. To date, there is no consensus on the number of consolidation chemotherapy 
cycles (range 1-4), number of agents (cytarabine alone vs cytarabine ± anthracycline), and drug 
dose (high- vs intermediate-dose cytarabine) needed for the best possible outcomes for older 
patients with AML. For lack of better information, older patients with favourable- or intermediate-risk 
AML who achieve CR after upfront cytarabine and anthracycline-based chemotherapy typically are 
offered 2-4 cycles of intermediate- to high-dose cytarabine. In contrast, patients with adverse 
karyotype AML who achieve CR have been shown to fare poorly regardless of intensive induction and 
consolidation chemotherapy and therefore should be referred for investigational therapy in the 
post-remission setting (Buchner, 2006). (For further reading be referred to the recent review of 
Wang (Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program, 2014).) 
About the product 
Azacitidine (Vidaza; 4-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-s-triazin-2[1H]-one) is an antineoplastic 
medicinal product, with anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Code L01BC07. Azacitidine is an 
analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine that incorporates into ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effect 
by cytotoxicity to abnormal haematopoietic cell in the bone marrow (BM) and hypomethylation of 
DNA. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may be due to inhibition of protein synthesis and activation 
of DNA damage pathways, upon incorporation into RNA and DNA, respectively. Incorporation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 8/74 
 
  
  
azacitidine into DNA also results in DNA hypomethylation and may allow the re-expression of genes 
involved in normal cell cycle regulation and differentiation. 
Azacitidine (Vidaza) is currently approved for: “The treatment of adult patients who are not eligible 
for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30% blasts 
and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to the WHO classification”.  
With the present variation the Applicant applies for an extension of the indication to: “The treatment 
of adult patients age 65 years or older who are not eligible for HSCT with AML with >30% marrow 
blasts according to the WHO classification.” 
Azacitidine has been extensively studied in MDS and has been shown in a large, randomised Phase 3 
trial of higher-risk MDS patients to provide a survival advantage of 9.4 months over conventional 
care regimens (CCR). The clinical experience of azacitidine in AML is smaller, but efficacy results have 
been obtained in a subset of 113 patients from the MDS study who are diagnosed with MDS according 
to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, but who are considered to have AML according to 
the WHO-definition (20 to 30% blasts). The median survival was 24.5 months (n=55) in the 
azacitidine arm compared with 16.0 months (n=58) in the conventional care regimen arm. 
Additionally, the outcome was not significantly different in patients with an unfavourable karyotype, 
although the sample size was small. The Applicant has now investigated the use of azacitidine in the 
treatment of elderly patients with AML, in the AZA-AML-001 study. This study included patients with 
>30% bone marrow blasts, a threshold considered to be diagnostic of AML in both the WHO and FAB 
classification. 
•  CHMP guidelines/Scientific Advice 
•  Orphan indication 
Azacitidine was designated an Orphan Medicinal Product in the European Union (EU) for the 
treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) (EU/3/07/509), granted on 29 November 2007. The 
application for the orphan drug designation was based on the following criterion: 
- AML was estimated to be affecting less than 2 in 10,000 persons in the Community at the time the 
application was made; 
- the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the high mortality rate of the 
refractory or relapsed disease; 
- although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorized in the 
Community, justifications have been provided that azacitidine may be of significant benefit to those 
affected by the condition.  
For the newly applied indication, the Applicant has been granted an orphan designation on the same 
grounds.  
Other medicinal products have already been designated as an Orphan medicinal product for a 
condition relating to the newly applied for azacitidine indication, these products include Ceplene 
(histamine dihydrochloride) and Dacogen (decitabine). Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 
141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the application included a 
critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products. 
• 
Paediatric investigation plan 
Pursuant to Article 16(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the Applicant has 
submitted in February 2013 an application for a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Vidaza and a 
deferral under Article 20 of said regulation and a waiver under Article 13 of said regulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 9/74 
 
  
  
For the AML indication a waiver for the paediatric population from birth to less than 3 months was 
granted on grounds that clinical studies with the specific medicinal product cannot be expected to be 
of significant therapeutic benefit to or fulfil a therapeutic need in this patient population.  
The indication targeted by the paediatric investigation plan includes the treatment of children with 
molecular relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia in the first complete remission. The Applicant has 
agreed to conduct a multicentre, randomized, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacodynamics and efficacy of azacitidine compared to no anti-cancer treatment in children from 
3 months to less than 18 years of age (and young adults) in first complete remission after treatment 
for acute myeloid leukaemia who have increasing molecular signals of aberrations associated with 
AML. The PDCO agreed that the study should be completed by May 2024.  
In addition to the paediatric study on AML, the PIP also included a paediatric study in 
newly-diagnosed advanced MDS or newly-diagnosed Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) 
patients. For this indication, a waiver was granted for the paediatric population from birth to less than 
1 months on the grounds that the disease or condition does not occur in this patient population.. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non- clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Vidaza environmental risk assessment previously submitted (De Roode, 2010) was based on 
prevalence of MDS in the EU and has been updated to support an application for a new therapeutic 
indication based on the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 guideline and the EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 
Q&A document on ERA. 
The  initial  (Phase  I)  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  in  surface  water  (PECSURFACEWATER; 
assuming no human metabolism and no environmental dissipation) was calculated to be 0.0103 μg/L 
and hence at the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L. Refinement of the PECSURFACEWATER calculation (Phase IIB) 
revealed a concentration of 0.00035 μg/L, which is ~1/30th of the action limit. 
Of note: The questions and answers on the EMA guidance (Committee, 2011) indicates that a further 
refinement  of  the  Fpen  is  possible  based  on  the  posology.  This  further  refinement  was  taken  into 
account in calculating the total PECSURFACEWATER for both the indications MDS and AML resulting in a 
lower total PECSURFACEWATER (0.010 μg/L) compared to the 2010 value calculated for MDS only. 
An environmental toxicity, physical-chemical and fate profile (Phase IIA) was established for 
azacitidine, based on prolonged toxicity studies in aquatic organisms, an activated sewage sludge 
respiration inhibition test, a ready biodegradability test and a sludge adsorption coefficient (Koc). 
These studies were all conducted in accordance with GLP and allowed a Predicted No Effect 
Concentration (PNEC) derivation. 
PEC/PNEC ratio for Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) microorganisms, aquatic organisms and 
groundwater did not exceed the relevant trigger. Hence, the risk to the STP, the aquatic environment 
and the groundwater compartment is concluded to be low. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of azacitidine.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
For this new indication, no new pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. New pharmacokinetic 
studies are not necessary, because the dose regimen of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days per 28 days 
recommended for the new indication (i.e. the elderly patients (>=65 yrs) with AML (>30% marrow 
blasts)) is the same as that for approved indications. Regarding the influence of reduced renal 
function in elderly patients, this issue was addressed previously for approved indications that no 
specific dose adjustments were recommended for elderly. Thus, no further pharmacokinetic study in 
elderly patients is necessary. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new clinical pharmacology studies for azacitidine have been conducted in support of the proposed 
new indication in elderly AML (> 30% blasts). The absence of additional studies is acceptable because 
of the close relationship between the currently approved indications and the currently proposed 
indication. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The absence of additional studies pharmacology and pharmacokinetic is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No new dose-response studies were provided. The dose regimen recommended for the new 
indication (i.e. the elderly patients (>=65 yrs) with AML (>30% marrow blasts)) is the same as that 
for approved indications. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study AZA-AML-001: A PHASE 3, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, OPEN-LABEL, STUDY OF 
AZACITIDINE (VIDAZA) VERSUS CONVENTIONAL CARE REGIMENS FOR THE TREATMENT 
OF OLDER SUBJECTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study population consists of subjects who are ≥ 65 years old with newly diagnosed, histologically 
confirmed de novo AML or AML secondary to prior myelodysplastic disease with > 30% bone marrow 
blasts and who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria define a heterogeneous intermediate/high risk AML population with adequate organ 
function and ECOG performance status of 2 or less. A white blood cell (WBC) count of > 15 x 109/L at 
screening and randomization was one of the exclusion criteria. This cut-off value was chosen with 
guidance from members of the study Steering Committee as an adequate value to limit the possibility 
that highly proliferative subjects could proliferate out of control before a lower intensity therapy could 
be effective in controlling the disease.

Treatments 
Treatment options for the conventional care regimens were assigned by the investigator before 
randomisation, based on local practice and on evaluation of the subject’s underlying disease 
condition.  
Following the assignment and documentation of the CCR by the investigator, subjects were to be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment arms in the study: 
•  Azacitidine SC at 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days; or 
•  CCR as assigned by the investigator prior to randomization. The 3 CCRs that subjects could 
be assigned to included: 
− 
Intensive chemotherapy: intravenous (IV) cytarabine in conjunction with an 
anthracycline in a “7+3” regimen, plus BSC; or 
− 
Low-dose cytarabine (LDAC): 20 mg subcutaneously (SC), twice daily (BID) for 10 days, 
every 28 days, plus BSC; or 
−  Best supportive care (BSC) only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 15/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of cycles was not fixed. For azacitidine or LDAC treated subjects, the aim was at least 6 
or 4 treatment cycles, respectively. For the subjects treated with intensive chemotherapy, the first 
(induction) cycle should have been followed by a maximum of 2 consolidation cycles. Following the 
consolidation phase of the intensive chemotherapy regime, the subject could continue in the study, 
receiving best supportive care, as appropriate.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority in overall survival of azacitidine 
compared with the combined conventional care regimens in subjects aged 65 years or more who had 
newly diagnosed AML with more than 30% bone marrow blasts according to WHO, and who were not 
eligible for HSCT. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to determine: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the one-year OS rate in the azacitidine treatment arm compared with the combined 
conventional care regimens (CCRs) 
the effect of azacitidine compared with the combined CCRs on event-free survival (EFS) 
the effect of azacitidine compared with the combined CCRs on relapse-free survival (RFS) 
the effect of azacitidine compared with the combined CCRs on overall remission rate (CR + 
morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) and duration of 
remission 
the effect of azacitidine compared with the combined CCRs on cytogenetic complete 
remission rate (CRc) 
the safety and toxicity of azacitidine relative to the CCRs; 
the effect of azacitidine compared with the combined conventional care regimens on 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and healthcare resource utilization (HRU). 
The exploratory objectives of the study were: 
• 
• 
To identify molecular markers in the bone marrow at baseline that were predictive of 
response or nonresponse to azacitidine 
To identify molecular markers in the bone marrow during therapy that were associated with 
response or nonresponse to azacitidine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was OS, defined as time from randomization to death from any 
cause. Subjects surviving at the end of the follow-up period or who withdrew consent to follow-up 
were censored at the date of last contact. Subjects who were lost to follow-up were censored at the 
date last known alive. 
Secondary endpoints were: One-year overall survival rate; Event-free survival (EFS); Relapse-free 
survival (RFS); Overall remission rate (CR + CRi); Duration of remission (CR + CRi); Cytogenetic 
complete remission rate (CRc); Safety / tolerability (type, frequency, severity, and relationship of 
adverse events to study treatments; physical examinations, vital signs; clinical laboratory 
evaluations, and concomitant medication/therapy); Patient-reported outcomes utilizing the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life questionnaire (EORTC 
QLQ-C30); and Measures of healthcare resource utilization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 16/74 
 
  
  
Event-free survival was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of 
treatment failure, progressive disease, relapse after CR or CRi, death from any cause, or lost to 
follow-up, whichever occurs first. Subjects who are still alive and in continuous CR/CRi were to be 
censored at the date of last follow-up. 
Relapse-free survival was defined only for subjects that achieve CR and CRi and is measured as the 
interval from the date of first documented leukemia-free state (defined as less than 5% blasts in an 
aspirate sample) to the date of disease relapse, death from any cause, or lost to follow-up, whichever 
occurs first, censoring for subjects alive in continuous CR/CRi.  
Disease response was assessed using the Modified IWG AML response criteria (Cheson, 2003). 
Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as 1) a > 50% increase in bone marrow blast count percentage 
from the baseline bone marrow blast count that persists for at least 2 bone marrow assessments 
separated by at least 1 month, unless the baseline bone marrow blast count is > 70%, in which case, 
a finding of > 70% blasts that persists for 2 post-baseline bone marrow assessments separated by at 
least 1 month would be considered progression, or 2) a doubling of the baseline absolute peripheral 
blood blast count that persists for at least 7 days and the final absolute peripheral blood blast count 
is > 10 x 109/L. The date of progressive disease is defined as the first date that there was either a > 
50% increase in bone marrow blast count from baseline, a persistence of bone marrow blasts > 70% 
in subjects with a baseline bone marrow blast count of > 70%, or a doubling of the peripheral blood 
blast count. 
Sample size 
The effect of azacitidine vs CCR was assumed to be 10.5 vs 7.5 months (HR=0.71), for which 374 
deaths were required to obtain 90% power at alpha=0.05 two-sided. Given 19 months accrual, 12 
month follow-up, 240 vs 240 subjects were planned to be randomized.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment arms in the study. 
Subjects were stratified on  
•  CCR selection: intensive chemotherapy vs (low dose cytarabine or BSC alone) i.e. two levels 
•  ECOG PS 0-1 vs 2 
•  Cytogenetics (intermediate v poor-risk) 
Stratified blocked randomization was used (based on the above stratification factors) and 
implemented by IVRS. Blocking was documented but not included in the SAP, since the trial was 
open-label. 
No crossover between any of the treatment groups was permitted. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study AZA-AML-001 was an open-label study. Central review of haematologic responses and 
cytogenetic laboratory samples were performed with all central reviewers blinded to subject 
treatment assignment. The evaluations by central review were used for the statistical efficacy 
analyses. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy variable, time to death from any cause, was to be analyzed using a stratified 
log-rank test, stratifying for treatment, ECOG, and cytogenetic risk. The analysis was to be

performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that includes all subjects randomized.  No interim 
analyses were performed.  
Results 
Participant flow 
The participant flow is presented in Figure 1. 
A total of 672 subjects were screened for participation in the study at 107 investigational sites; 184 
subjects (27.4%) failed screening. The reasons for screening failure were exclusion criteria met in 94 
subjects, with WBC count higher than 15 x 109/L (41/672 subjects; 6.1%) as the most frequently met 
exclusion criteria, and inclusion criteria not met in 98 subjects, with not having BM blasts more than 
30% (35/672 subjects; 5.2%) as the most frequent unmet inclusion criteria. The reasons for 
screening failure mainly concern disease characteristics, thus contributing to the definition of the 
disease. 
The reasons why patients were not eligible for HSCT and why patients were not eligible for intensive 
chemotherapy were collected. Of the 44 patients in the control group receiving intensive 
chemotherapy, 43 were not eligible for transplant because of age, other reasons included 
comorbidities (5), no acceptable donor (1) and/or subject decision (1) (Figure 2).

Recruitment 
This was a multicentre, international Phase 3 study conducted at 107 investigational sites in 18 
countries from different geographic regions. Overall, 107 investigational sites screened subjects and 
98 sites randomized subjects. Date first subject screened: 04 Oct 2010; date last subject completed: 
22 Jan 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
The initial study protocol (dated 27 Oct 2009) was amended four times during the study. These 
amendments mostly concerned administrative and textual modification/clarifications to various 
sections of the protocol. The amendments are not expected to have significantly impacted the 
conduct of the study, the population included or the outcome. 
In the full ITT population, major protocol violations were observed in the following categories: safety 
assessments (68 subjects, mainly delayed reporting of an SAE), informed consent (44 subjects, 
mainly date on consent form or not updating consent form), study drug (29 subjects, mainly 
(uncertainties on) the refrigeration time or use of an other stock of study drug than specified in the 
protocol), exclusion criteria (6 subjects), efficacy assessments (5 subjects), inclusion criteria (4 
subjects), concomitant medication (1 subject), and other (1 subject). The number of major protocol

violations was generally similar in the azacitidine and CCR treatment groups, except those specifically 
related to the study drug.

[b] One subject had acute myelomonocytic leukemia where the bone marrow differential was 18.5% blasts and 
21.5 % promonocytes, for a total leukemic cell count of 40%. The CRF did not allow the entry of the bone marrow 
promonocyte cell count. 
[c] Subjects were randomized based on local pathology assessment of baseline bone marrow blast count. Baseline 
BM slides were retrospectively reviewed by the central pathology reviewer. In some cases, the baseline BM blast 
count was found to be less than 30% by the central pathology reviewer. These subjects were not removed from 
the study and were allowed to continue assigned treatment.

Of all subjects who discontinued treatment during the study for reasons other than study closure, 217 
(90.0%) subjects discontinued azacitidine treatment compared with 234 (94.7%) subjects who 
discontinued conventional care treatment. Within the CCR group, the percentage of discontinuations 
was highest for the BSC only subjects (100%) and lowest for intensive chemotherapy subjects 
(88.6%).

Regarding the follow-up treatment within the investigator’s choice of CCR subpopulations or within 
the respective azacitidine subpopulations see table 7 below. 
Within the CCR treatment group, the percentage of subjects with at least 1 follow-up treatment was 
higher in the intensive chemotherapy group (n=18, 41.9%) compared to the low-dose cytarabine 
group (n=51, 32.3%), or the BSC only group (n=6, 13.3%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Overall, 394 deaths (80.7%) occurred in the ITT population. Deaths were reported for 193 (80.1%) 
subjects in the azacitidine group and 201 (81.4%) subjects in the CCR group. 
Primary endpoint: Overall survival 
The Kaplan Meier (KM) plot of time to death from any cause for the ITT population is presented in 
Figure 3. After a median follow-up time of 24.4 months, the median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI = 
8.0, 12.7) in the azacitidine group (N = 241) compared with 6.5 months (95% CI = 5.0, 8.6) in the 
CCR group (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 24/74 
 
  
  
 
Table 8). The OS HR for the azacitidine group vs CCR was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.69, 1.03) with an 
observed difference in median OS of 3.8 months in favour of azacitidine. The difference between 
survival curves based on the log-rank test did not reach the predefined level of significance (log rank 
test, with a stratified p = 0.1009).

(17.0% of subjects in the azacitidine treatment group and 14.6% of subjects in the CCR treatment 
group).

c Duration of remission: time from the date CR or CRi was first documented until the date of documented relapse 
from CR or CRi for subjects who achieved CR or CRi. 
Secondary endpoint results within preselected groups 
The results for secondary endpoints within the low-dose cytarabine preselection group were 
consistent with the improvement seen in the primary endpoint of OS. Specifically, there was an 
increase of 14.5% (48.5% vs 34.0%) in the 1-year survival estimate in azacitidine-treated subjects 
compared with low-dose cytarabine-treated subjects. Median EFS was longer in azacitidine-treated 
subjects compared with the low-dose cytarabine-treated subjects (7.3 months vs 4.8 months). 
Median RFS (8.6 months vs 9.9 months), overall response rate (CR + CRi) were similar between the 
azacitidine and low-dose cytarabine groups.

Growth factor use 
According to the protocol, the use of Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and myeloid growth factors 
(granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor [GM-CSF]) was allowed. Given the few subjects who received erythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents during the study (n=5 in total), no impact on haematological values and/or transfusion 
dependence was expected.

Health-related Quality of Life 
Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) assessment was complicated by a small sample size, a 
reduced number of evaluations received for the combined CCR group after Cycle 3, and a large 
variation in responses within treatment groups. 
Within each treatment group, mean changes from baseline to the end-of-study visit varied, with wide 
distributions and standard deviations for the Fatigue, Dyspnoea, Physical Functioning, and Global 
Health Status/QoL domains, making it challenging to establish whether there were any true 
differences between treatment groups. In both groups, these domains appeared to improve slightly 
over time during treatment, but worsened or remained unchanged compared with baseline at 
end-of-study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 30/74 
 
  
  
 
 
Thus, no firm conclusions can be drawn other than that the data seems to indicate that there is no 
detrimental effect of azacitidine on HRQoL when compared to combined CCR.

Post Hoc Analyses - influence of subsequent therapy on azacitidine vs combined CCR group  
Three post-hoc analyses were performed to adjust for the effect of subsequent therapies using a 
stepwise variable selection procedure, which consisted of a series of forward selection and backward

The results of the 1-year survival endpoint for the investigator’s choice of CCR subpopulations are in 
line with that observed for the combined CCR study population. A suggestion of an improved median 
EFS in the azacitidine treated subjects is seen within the BSC subpopulation and the low dose 
cytarabine subpopulation. In contrast, in the subjects selected to receive intensive chemotherapy 
results of the EFS were in favour of the intensive chemotherapy group. As with the combined CCR 
study population, also the other key secondary endpoints show no substantial difference between the 
benefit of treatment of intensive chemotherapy or azacitidine. Notably, there are clear differences in 
secondary endpoints between the subgroups of azacitidine treated subjects (e.g. 1 year survival 
estimate is 30% within the BSC-selected azacitidine treated patients, while it is 56% in the intensive

chemotherapy selected azacitidine subjects). This confirms the notion that the investigator’s choice 
of therapy encompasses different patient populations.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No pooled and meta-analysis were performed. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There are no data on use in renal or hepatic impaired patients. This is acknowledged by the Applicant, 
and noted as important missing information in the RMP. 
Supportive studies 
In addition to the pivotal study, this Application is supported by the results from the original 
registration study (Study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001), and a subpopulation of this study with 20% to 
30% BM blast count and multi-lineage dysplasia. In addition, reports of 4 registry or compassionate 
use studies in AML patients treated with azacitidine were provided. Furthermore, a summary of 3 
prospective studies and 3 retrospective analyses of azacitidine in elderly patients with newly 
diagnosed AML was provided (data not shown). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority in overall survival of azacitidine 
compared with the combined conventional care regimens. The primary analyses were performed on 
the intent to treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The primary 
analysis seems to be defined as two analyses: stratified and unstratified. As the randomization was 
stratified, it is recommended that the primary analysis would be stratified as well and this is in 
accordance with the protocol specified analysis.  
The pivotal trial was open-label. All central reviewers (pathology and cytogenetic) were blinded to 
subject treatment assignment, and evaluations by central review were used for the statistical efficacy 
analyses.  
Regular bone biopsies/aspirates were not planned at the same points within a cycle for each group 
(e.g. cycle 3, 5, 7 for azacitidine and low dose cytarabine; cycle 4, 7, 10 for BSC; every two cycles for 
intensive chemotherapy). Nevertheless, it is not likely that differences in BM collection plans have 
impacted the results of the secondary endpoints EFS and RFS considering that best supportive care 
and the low dose cytarabine group have a similar sampling plan and the limited duration of the 
intensive chemotherapy treatment (median 2 cycles (max 3 cycles) of each median 63.5 days)) in 
relation to the median EFS and the RFS that are well above 8 months.

EMA/757391/2015 
Page 37/74 
 
  
  
During the study 4 protocol amendments were made, it is agreed with the Applicant that these 
amendments are not expected to have significantly impacted the conduct of the study, the population 
included or the outcome. Several major protocol violations were noted, however, it is considered 
unlikely that these violations had significant impact on the safety or the validity of the efficacy 
assessments. 
Patient population (demographics, disease characteristics at baseline) 
The AZA-AML-001 ITT study population was a high risk AML population: 54.3% of subjects were at 
least 75 years of age (median age, 75.0), 32.4% had AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, 
17.8% had a prior history of MDS, 34.8% had a poor cytogenetic risk AML (of whom 16.8% had a 
very poor cytogenetic risk), 23.2% had ECOG PS of 2, and 71.5% presented at least 1 comorbidity at 
baseline. Moreover, median baseline BM blasts was 72.0% and median PB values at baseline were 
2.5 x 109/L for WBCs, 0.3 x 109/L for absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and 53.0 x 109/L for platelets.  
The baseline characteristics for the ITT appeared generally well balanced between the 
azacitidine-treated patients and the combined CCR population. The only obvious difference between 
the treatment groups seems to be the percentage of subjects who received prior systemic anti-cancer 
treatment, which was higher in the combined CCR group (10.1%) compared to the azacitidine group 
(3.3%). Also the demographic disposition appeared generally well balanced between the azacitidine 
and the combined CCR group.  
In the CCR population, subjects receiving intensive chemotherapy group had better patient-related 
prognostic factors with a lower median age (median age, 70.5), fewer comorbidities (61.4% of 
subjects with at least 1 comorbidity), and better disease-related prognostic factors compared to the 
low-dose cytarabine and BSC-only groups. Subjects in the BSC-only group had the worst patient- and 
disease-related prognostic factors. The differences seen in baseline characteristics between the CCR 
subpopulations are as expected, and are a reflection of the heterogeneity of the intended patient 
population. As part of the consistency assessment of the results across subpopulations comparisons 
are made between the subpopulations based on investigator’s choice of CCR.  
Formally cross over between the treatment groups was not allowed, however, within the CCR group, 
28 (11%) patients received azacitidine as follow-up treatment subsequent to study discontinuation, 
while 40 (17%) of the azacitidine-treated patients received cytarabine as one of the CCR treatment 
options. 
Outcomes 
Overall, 394 deaths (80.7%) occurred in the ITT population. Deaths were reported for 193 (80.1%) 
subjects in the azacitidine group and 201 (81.4%) subjects in the combined CCR group. The data are 
considered mature. After a median follow-up time of 24.4 months, the median OS was 10.4 months 
(95% CI = 8.0, 12.7) in the azacitidine group (N = 241) compared with 6.5 months (95% CI = 5.0, 
8.6) in the CCR group with an observed difference in median OS of 3.8 months. The OS HR for the 
azacitidine group vs CCR was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.69, 1.03), but was not statistically significant. A 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards (PH) model adjusting for established patient- and 
disease-related, pre-specified baseline prognostic factors defined a HR for azacitidine versus CCR of 
0.80 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99), with a 20% reduction of the risk of death and a nominal p-value below 
0.05 (p = 0.0355). 
In support of the primary efficacy analysis, planned exploratory analyses were conducted based on 
investigator’s preselection for CCR using the same methods as for the primary analysis, without 
stratification. When considering investigator pre-selection, the KM median time to death was longer 
in each of the azacitidine treated groups when compared with the BSC (5.8 versus 3.7 months; p = 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 38/74 
 
  
  
0.0288), or low-dose cytarabine, but the latter was not significant (11.2 versus 6.4 months; p = 
0.4270). The OS HR of  0.6 in the BSC choice subpopulation reached statistical significance and was 
in favour of azacitidine.  
Regarding the impact of baseline factors on OS results in subgroups within the preselection groups, 
the number of subjects in the individual prespecified subgroups based on baseline factors within the 
preselection groups is small. This implies that caution should be applied when drawing conclusions, 
but the following results were observed: 
Best supportive care - there was a consistent trend in OS benefit (as measured in OS HR) 
across the subgroups in favour of azacitidine compared with best supportive care; 
Low dose cytarabine - there was a consistent trend in OS benefit (as measured in OS HR) 
across the subgroups in favour of azacitidine compared with low-dose cytarabine when 
looking at the OS HR point-estimates, though the trend was weaker as observed in the 
best-supportive care group. The pattern was more or less similar to what was observed with 
the ITT population. 
Intensive chemotherapy - the results are very difficult to interpret due to the low patient 
numbers per subgroup. 
Secondary endpoints 
The most clear difference between the study arms in terms of the secondary endpoints results is 
observed in the 1-year survival rate. There was a clinically meaningful improvement of 12.3% (95% 
CI = 3.5, 21.0) in the 1-year survival estimate for the azacitidine group (46.5% [95% CI = 40.1, 
52.7]) versus the combined CCR group (34.3% [95% CI = 28.3, 40.3]). In addition, there was a 
suggestion towards an improved median EFS with azacitidine compared with the combined CCR 
treatment group (6.7 months versus 4.8 months respectively). Differences between experimental 
and control arm in the other secondary endpoints are not substantial. In this respect, there is a trend 
towards longer duration of remission in the control group and the rate of haematological remission 
was rather similar between the two arms of the study.  
The 1-year survival rate for the investigator’s choice of CCR subpopulations is in line with what was 
seen for OS in these populations, with a higher survival rate in the azacitidine group compared with 
the CCR group for those subjects selected for BSC or low-dose cytarabine, and a similar survival rate 
for the azacitidine and CCR groups for those subjects selected to receive intensive chemotherapy.  
As with the analysis in the ITT, the other key secondary endpoints showed no substantial difference 
between the azacitidine or CCR treatment groups within each of the investigator’s choice 
subpopulations, apart from EFS, where azacitidine treated subjects tended to have a longer EFS in 
the BSC and the low-dose cytarabine choice of CCR subgroup. In the patients selected for intensive 
chemotherapy, EFS seemed shorter in the azacitidine treated patients. 
There was a trend in favour of azacitidine when comparing the rates of conversion of subjects from 
RBC transfusion dependence to RBC transfusion independence, and from platelet transfusion 
dependence to platelet transfusion independence. However, the median duration of transfusion 
independence for RBCs or platelets was somewhat shorter in the azacitidine treatment group 
compared the CCR treatment.  
Regarding growth factor use as supportive measure, given the few subjects who received 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents during the study (n=5 in total), no impact on haematological 
values and/or transfusion dependence is expected. No meaningful differences in the number of 
courses or cumulative dose of myeloid growth factor was observed between the azacitidine and 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 39/74 
 
  
  
combined CCR treatment group. As expected, the number of courses and cumulative dose of myeloid 
growth factor was lower in the BSC-only group and higher in the intensive chemotherapy group. 
Given the similarity of myeloid growth factor use between the groups, it is unlikely that there was a 
differential effect on hematologic values. 
Finally, concerning HRQoL, no firm conclusions can be drawn other than that the data seems to 
indicate that there is no detrimental effect of azacitidine on HRQoL when compared to CCR.  
Supportive studies and cross study concordance 
A survival benefit of azacitidine treatment is also noted in the AML population of the registration study 
(AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001). Moreover, the survival seen in the registries and in published studies with 
azacitidine in AML population differs between studies, as it is affected by the included AML patient 
population, but is within the same range as here reported in the pivotal study (data not shown). 
2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the study was well designed and conducted for this purpose. Although the primary OS 
analysis for the effect of azacitidine in comparison to combined CCR did not show a statistically 
significant difference, a prognostic-factor adjusted Cox-PH model showed a HR of 0.80 and p-value 
<0.05. The treatment effect in terms of the point-estimates of the OS HR in the various CCR 
preselection groups, in several of the pre-specified subpopulations and in a post-hoc defined patient 
subpopulation with the worst disease, i.e. AML subjects who had either myelodysplasia-related 
changes in the BM and/or adverse cytogenetics at diagnosis, are in favour of azacitidine to a variable 
extent. Support was provided by the results from several of the secondary endpoints. Finally, results 
from the additional (sensitivity) analyses to correct for subsequent AML therapy imply overall 
anti-disease activity of azacitidine relative to CCR. In conclusion, the efficacy is considered 
established. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Azacitidine is a nucleoside analogue designed to incorporate into RNA and DNA in place of cytidine, 
with a mechanism of action that is related to demethylation and cytotoxicity. Since rapidly dividing 
cells are most sensitive to a cell cycle-specific agent, like azacitidine, adverse event characteristics of 
such compounds most commonly include BM suppression (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, 
neutropenia), adverse consequences of BM suppression (infection, haemorrhage), and 
gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). In addition to the potential cytotoxic effects, 
demethylating agents have been shown to affect spermatogenesis and embryo development in 
animals. As a result, precaution should be taken to avoid the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. 
In addition, animal data suggest that the liver and kidney may be target organs. Non-clinical studies 
indicate that the toxicology profile of azacitidine is generally consistent with that of other pyrimidine 
analogues of the antimetabolite class. 
The evaluation of safety focuses on data from 471 elderly AML subjects treated in the AZA-AML-001 
Phase 3 study. In further support of the safety of azacitidine, additional safety information is 
summarized from: 
- 
the Phase 3 Study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 in high-risk MDS patients and AML patients with 
20% to 30% BM blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, including a descriptive comparison of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 40/74 
 
  
  
 
safety data in the approved indication of higher risk MDS with that from the elderly AML 
population in AZA AML 001,  
from AML investigator-initiated trials (IITs) (serious AEs reported to Celgene from cases 
received through 18 May 2014), and  
from post-marketing data from the most recent azacitidine (Vidaza) Periodic Safety Update 
Report (PSUR) covering the reporting period 19 May 2013 through 18 May 2014 (PSUR, 16 
- 
- 
Jul 2014).  
Patient exposure 
In the pivotal trial a total of 471 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 
post-dose safety assessment (at least 1 post-randomization safety assessment for BSC only), and 
were thus evaluable for safety analyses. This safety population included 236 subjects in the 
azacitidine group, 40 subjects in the BSC-only group, 153 subjects in the low-dose cytarabine group, 
and 42 subjects in the intensive chemotherapy group. The median duration of exposure was longer in 
the azacitidine group (191.5 days) compared with low-dose cytarabine treated subjects (125.0 days) 
and intensive chemotherapy treated subjects (124.5 days). The median number of cycles that was 
administered per treatment option was the highest in the azacitidine group, i.e.: 
- 
azacitidine was given for a median of 6.0 cycles (range: 1 to 28 cycles) (planned was at least 
6 cycles), with 124 (52.5%) subjects who received at least 6 cycles and 76 (32.2%) subjects 
who received at least 12 cycles; 
- 
- 
low-dose cytarabine was given for a median of 4 cycles (range: 1 to 25 cycles) (planned was 
at least 4 cycles), with 79 (51.6%) subjects receiving at least 4 cycles; 
intensive chemotherapy was given for a median of 2.0 cycles (planned was max 3 cycles) 
with 59.5% (25/42) of subjects who received at least 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy 
while 42.9% (18/42) of subjects received 3 cycles; 
- 
in the BSC-only group, the median number of cycles was 3.0 (range: 1 to 20 cycles). 
When calculated as person-years of exposure, this was 174.9 for SC azacitidine, 82.9 for low-dose 
cytarabine, 14.1 for intensive chemotherapy, and 9.6 for BSC-only. Thus, as expected, the duration 
of exposure in person-years in the azacitidine group was also longer than in the other treatment 
subgroups.  
Dose modifications 
The very most of the patients receiving azacitidine did not have a dose modification. Indeed, of the 
236 subjects in the azacitidine treatment group, 207 (87.7%) remained on 75 mg/m2 throughout the 
study with no dose adjustments. Of the other patients at least 1 dose modification was reported in 29 
(12.3%) with the very most patients in this subgroup having only 1 dose adjustment, i.e. twenty-five 
subjects (10.6%). Even lower frequencies of dose modifications were observed in the CCR treatment 
groups, with at least 1 dose modification to be reported in 7 (4.6%) subjects for low-dose cytarabine. 
For intensive chemotherapy at least one dose modification was reported in 2 (4.8%) subjects for 
cytarabine, in 1 (4.8%) subject for daunorubicin, and in 2 (9.5%) subjects for idarubicin. 
In the azacitidine treatment group, the main reason for dose modifications was haematological 
toxicity for 21 (8.9%) subjects. The main reason was “other ” for the low-dose cytarabine and 
intensive chemotherapy treatment groups (percentages were as described as frequency of dose 
modification). This concerned only few patients in absolute terms for these CCR subgroups (i.e. 2 to 
7 patients per study drug).

Patient demographics and disease characteristics of the safety population at baseline 
In the safety population (N = 471), the median age was 75.0 years (range 64.0 to 91.0 years) with 
approximately half (53.3%) of the subjects ≥ 75 years, the majority of the patients were White 
(75.2%), and 59.2% of the subjects were male. Furthermore, the majority of subjects in the overall 
study population (60.1%) were classified as AML not otherwise specified. The other WHO AML 
subtypes were AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (32.7%), therapy-related myeloid 
neoplasms (4.2%), and AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (3.0%) (7). Together, these data 
show that the overall safety population adequately represents the elderly patient with AML. 
As expected, within the CCR treatment groups, subjects who received intensive chemotherapy were 
slightly younger than any of the other treatment groups, with a median age of 70.5 years and 73.8% 
of the subjects < 75 years. Subjects in the BSC-only group were slightly older than subjects in any of 
the other treatment groups with a median age of 77.5 years and 32.5% of the subjects < 75 years. 
These differences are as expected considering the divergent safety risks associated with the 
respective therapy choices. Finally, baseline demographic characteristics of subjects in the low-dose 
cytarabine treatment group were similar to those of the subjects in the azacitidine treatment group.

As one of the parameters of interest for prognosis, the percentage of subjects with AML with 
myelodysplasia-related changes was similar between the azacitidine (31.4%) and the combined CCR 
groups (32.7%). Furthermore, within the CCR treatment groups, the intensive chemotherapy 
treatment group had a smaller percentage of subjects with a previous history of MDS (9.5%) and 
ECOG of 2 (19.0%) compared to the other treatment groups, although the difference for these 
parameters between the intensive chemotherapy group and the low dose cytarabine group (LDAC) is 
not substantial. For comparison, prior MDS concerned 13.1% of the LDAC group and 25.0% of the 
BSC-only patients and ECOG 2 concerned 22.2% of the LDAC group and 32.5% of the BSC-only 
patients.  
Regarding prior therapy, only 7.0% of subjects in the safety population (N = 471) received at least 1 
prior systemic anti-cancer therapy and 7.0% received at least 1 prior radiation therapy. The 
percentage of subjects who received prior systemic anti-cancer treatment was higher in the 
combined CCR treatment group (10.6%) compared to the azacitidine treatment group (3.4%). This 
seems to be the only obvious difference between the azacitidine and the CCR arm regarding baseline 
disease characteristics. 
Other key baseline disease characteristics, including peripheral blood cell counts (bone marrow 
blasts, haemoglobin, platelets, absolute neutrophil count, white blood cells), and the number of red 
blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions were similar between the azacitidine treatment group and 
the combined CCR treatment groups. Of note, peripheral blood cell counts were low at baseline as to 
be expected for subjects with AML.

Grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
In the Safety population, the percentages of subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 or 4 TEAE was reported 
in 87.7% of azacitidine subjects, 65.0% of the BSC-only subjects, 92.2% of low-dose cytarabine 
subjects, and 88.1% of intensive chemotherapy subjects . 
In azacitidine subjects, the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were febrile neutropenia 
(28.0%), neutropenia (26.3%), and thrombocytopenia (23.7%). These events were reported at 
similar or lower rates in the azacitidine group as compared to the 2 other active treatment groups, i.e. 
for low-dose cytarabine these rates were 30.1%, 24.8% and 27.5%, respectively, and for intensive 
chemotherapy these were 31.0%, 33.3% and 21.4%, respectively. In comparison to the BSC-only

group, the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 haematological TEAEs were higher in the azacitidine group, 
except for febrile neutropenia, which was observed in 27.5% in the BSC-only patients. Indeed, 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in only 5% of the BSC-only subjects. 
Table 28 Grade 3 or 4 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Reported in at Least 10% of Subjects (in 
the Azacitidine Group) by System Organ Class and Preferred Term  (Study AZA-AML-001: Safety 
Population) 
When adjusting for duration of exposure, the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs remained 
haematological disorders in the azacitidine group: febrile neutropenia (37.7), neutropenia (35.4), 
and thrombocytopenia (32.0). However, in comparison to the 2 other active treatment groups, these 
events occurred at 1.3- to 3-fold lower rates in the azacitidine group compared to the low-dose 
cytarabine or intensive chemotherapy groups. When compared to BSC, the incidence rate for Grade 
3 or 4 febrile neutropenia was 3-fold lower in the azacitidine group, whereas the incidence rates for 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia remained higher in the azacitidine group.  
Regarding the occurrence of neoplasms (either benign, malignant or unspecified), this is 
predominantly AML and is the lowest in the intensive chemotherapy CCR subgroup, i.e. 17.8% for 
azacitidine, 20.0% for BCS-only, 18.3% for LDAC and 2.4% for intensive chemotherapy. In case the 
AML as reported was a relapse or worsening of the underlying AML, these numbers may either 
represent a difference in the baseline chance for relapse for the intensive chemotherapy patients, 
indicate the stronger ability of the intensive chemotherapy regimen to eradicate the leukaemia or a 
combination thereof. The apparent difference in occurrence of AML between the individual groups, 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 52/74 
 
  
  
 
may have been impacted by several factors, including differences between the study groups in the 
duration of treatment and due to AE documentation rules. When all information is combined, the 
overall frequency of all AML events was similar between all treatment groups. It was previously 
concluded that the baseline disease characteristics were similar between the azacitidine and the 
combined CCR groups, except for the number of prior treatments. This was in favour of the 
azacitidine group, but it should be noted that a similar percentage of patients in the azacitidine group 
had previous treatment as in the intensive chemotherapy arm (though low absolute number), i.e. 
3.4% (n=8) vs 4.8% (n=2), respectively.  
Treatment-related adverse events 
In the safety population, at least 1 treatment-related adverse events (TEAE) considered related to 
study drug was reported in 79.7% of subjects treated with azacitidine, 81.0% of subjects treated 
with low-dose cytarabine, and 92.9% of subjects treated with intensive chemotherapy (Table 221). 
In the azacitidine group, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs included nausea 
(27.1%), neutropenia (19.9%), and thrombocytopenia (17.4%). The events of neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia were less frequently reported in the azacitidine group compared to the low dose 
cytarabine (22.9% and 22.2%, respectively) and intensive chemotherapy (31.0% and 21.4%, 
respectively) groups. Nausea was less frequently reported in low-dose cytarabine subjects (22.2%) 
as compared to azacitidine subjects, but was more frequently observed in intensive chemotherapy 
(42.9%) treated subjects as compared to azacitidine subjects. 
The percentages of subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAE was higher in the 
intensive chemotherapy group (69.0%) compared to the other 2 active treatment groups (53.0% for 
azacitidine subjects and 58.8% for low-dose cytarabine subjects). In the azacitidine group, the most 
frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAEs were neutropenia (17.4%), 
thrombocytopenia (14.4%), and febrile neutropenia (12.7%). The frequency of these Grade 3 or 4 
events was lower in the azacitidine group compared to the 2 other active treatment groups, i.e. for 
the LDAC patients these rates were 20.9%, 20.9% an 18.3%, respectively, and for the intensive 
chemotherapy subgroup these were 31.0%, 21.4% and 23.8%, respectively. 
Thus, the type of AEs designated as treatment-related (including Grade 3 or 4) are similar to the 
commonly-reported AEs. Furthermore, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs across 
the 3 active treatment groups were known effects of the active study drugs (haematological and 
gastrointestinal disorders).

Other significant events 
The earlier described data indicate that the important identified AEs (risks) associated with the use of 
azacitidine are commonly related to the blood and lymphatic system (neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia). Other common important identified risks include haemorrhagic events 
and infections. Less common AEs (risks) identified with the use of azacitidine include renal failure, 
hepatic failure, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). Events considered 
as important potential risks in the AML setting described in this section include cardiac events and 
ischemic colitis. 
The Applicant described that the most frequent reported TEAEs of special interest in the azacitidine 
group were infections (78.0%) and myelosuppression (69.5%). Furthermore, the overall 
percentages of subjects who experienced TEAEs and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of infection and 
myelosuppression appeared to be similar in the 3 active treatment groups and lower in the BSC-only 
group.  
Other frequently reported TEAEs of special interest in the azacitidine group were cardiac disorders 
reported in 44.1% of subjects, mainly peripheral oedema (23.3%), and haemorrhagic events in 
39.8% of subjects, mostly epistaxis (12.7%). The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 and serious cardiac 
TEAEs was similar across the 3 active treatment groups. The occurrence of haemorrhagic TEAEs was 
similar across the 4 treatment groups.

Serious adverse event/deaths  
In the Safety population, at least 1 serious TEAE was reported in 79.7% of subjects in the azacitidine 
group, 75.0% of subjects in the BSC group, 77.1% of subjects in the low-dose cytarabine group, and 
64.3% of subjects in the intensive chemotherapy group (Error! Reference source not found.3). 
The most common serious TEAEs reported in azacitidine subjects included febrile neutropenia 
(25.0%), pneumonia (20.3%), AML (11.0%), and pyrexia (10.6%). Serious febrile neutropenia, 
pneumonia, and AML events were mainly of Grade 3 or 4 severity (22.9%, 17.8%, and 8.9% of 
subjects). Similar trends were observed in low-dose cytarabine subjects with the most frequently 
reported serious TEAEs being febrile neutropenia (24.8%), pneumonia (19.0%), AML (11.1%), and 
pyrexia (10.5%). The percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs was lower in the intensive 
chemotherapy group with the most frequently reported serious TEAE being febrile neutropenia 
(16.7%). In the BSC-only group the most frequently reported serious TEAEs were AML (30.0%), 
febrile neutropenia (30.0%), and cellulitis (10.0%).  
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 serious TEAE was febrile neutropenia in the 4 treatment 
groups, which was more frequently observed in the BSC-only group (25.0%), in a similar percentage 
in low-cytarabine group (22.9%) and less frequently observed in the intensive chemotherapy group 
(16.7%) compared to the azacitidine group (22.9%). 
When adjusted for duration of exposure, the rate per person-year of serious TEAEs was lower in the 
azacitidine group (107.5) compared to the 3 other treatment groups (312.8 for BSC only, 142.3 for 
low-dose cytarabine, and 191.2 for intensive chemotherapy groups). 
Deaths in ITT 
On-treatment deaths were defined as deaths that occurred from the date of first dose of study drug 
through 28 days after the date of last dose of azacitidine and low-dose cytarabine, or from the date 
of first dose of study drug through 70 days after the date of last dose of intensive chemotherapy, or 
from the date of randomization through the date of treatment period discontinuation for best 
supportive care only. 
Similar pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment death rates were reported in the 3 active 
treatment groups despite the longer treatment duration for azacitidine subjects. The data show that: 
- 
post-treatment death for azacitidine was 54.8%, for LDAC was 53.2%, for intensive 
chemotherapy 50.0%, 
- 
on treatment death for azacitidine was 23.2%, for LDAC was 24.7%, and for intensive 
chemotherapy 22.7% and that  
- 
pre-treatment death for azacitidine was 2.1%, for LDAC was 1.9%, and for intensive 
chemotherapy 2.3%. 
The rate of on-treatment deaths was 2-fold higher in the BSC-only group as compared to the active 
treatment groups. This is as expected as no active treatment has been put into place (Table ). 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 56/74 
 
  
  
Table 31 Summary of Deaths (Study AZA-AML-001: All Subjects) 
Regarding the percentages of subjects with at least one Grade 5 TEAE (=TEAE leading to death), 
these were similar across the 3 active treatment groups, i.e. 23.7% of azacitidine subjects, 24.8% of 
low-dose cytarabine subjects, and 21.4% of intensive chemotherapy subjects, and higher in the 
BSC-only group (57.5% of subjects). 
In the azacitidine group, the primary causes of on-treatment death were categorized by the 
investigator as “death from other cause” in 35 (14.8%) subjects, of whom death was attributed to 
pneumonia in 13 subjects, and death from “malignant disease” in 14 (5.9%) subjects, with AML in 13 
subjects. Furthermore, the investigator categorized 2 deaths due to toxicity, which included 
pneumonia and viral pneumonia reported as the primary cause of death.  
In the CCR subgroups, the primary causes of on-treatment death were categorized by the 
investigator as “death from other cause”:  
- 
14 (35.0%) subjects of whom death was attributed to pneumonia in 3 subjects in the 
BSC-only group,  
- 
17 (11.1%) subjects of whom death was attributed to septic shock in 4 subjects in the LDAC 
group, and  
- 
5 (11.9%) subjects in the intensive chemotherapy group. 
In the azacitidine group, the most common TEAEs leading to death were pneumonia (6.4%) and AML 
(5.1%). In the other treatment groups, the Grade 5 TEAEs reported in at least 5% of subjects were 
AML (25.0%), pneumonia (7.5%), and cerebral haemorrhage (5.0%) in subjects receiving BSC only 
and AML (6.5%) in low-dose cytarabine treated subjects.  In the intensive chemotherapy group, the 
most frequently reported Grade 5 TEAE was respiratory failure occurring in 2 subjects (4.8%).

Table 32 Primary causes of death by death category during treatment by treatment group 
preselection (Study AZA-AML-001: Safety Population) 
Death from malignant disease was most prominent in the best supportive care group (20%) and the 
lowest in the intensive chemotherapy subgroup (2.4%) within the CCR preselection group. The 
percentage of subjects dying in the azacitidine groups was more or less similar across the CCR 
preselection groups.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Across all cycles for haemoglobin, the majority of subjects (54.9%) treated with azacitidine reached 
their lowest peripheral blood counts between Day 8 and Day 14 and the median time reach this point 
across all cycles was 12 days. For platelets, the majority of subjects (54.0%) reached their lowest 
blood counts between Day 8 and Day 14 and the median time to the lowest value across all cycles was 
14 days. This would mean that the 28-day cycle generally allowed for a sufficient amount of time for 
patients to recover before starting the next cycle. 
Overall, the median haemoglobin and platelet values in subjects treated with azacitidine improved 
over time. This would mean that the haematology data fit with the trend toward normalization for 
haemoglobin and platelets, and for transfusion independency. However, when comparing the results 
of azacitidine with LDAC or intensive chemotherapy, the haematological profile that was better at 
cycle 1 in the azacitidine group, more or less similar between the groups at cycle 2, but into favour of 
LDAC and intensive chemotherapy at cycle 3 and onward in case of LDAC (there were only 3 cycles of 
intensive chemotherapy). Regarding the BSC-only arm, also the haematological profile of these 
subjects steadily improved during the course of the supportive treatment, even up to cycle 6, and 
was better as compared to azacitidine from cycle 2 on. 
Chemistry and vital signs 
No important changes were noted for serum chemistry parameters and the analysis of vital sign data 
demonstrated no changes or trends over time.

Safety in special populations 
No relevant differences were observed by gender, race or extrinsic factors upon exposure to 
azacitidine. Overall , TEAEs reported more often with a ≥ 10% difference in subjects ≥ 75 years 
compared to < 75 years included asthenia (30.8% compared to 13.6%) and pneumonia (28.6% 
compared to 18.4%). Events reported with a ≥ 10% difference in subjects < 75 years compared to 
≥ 75 years included diarrhoea (42.7% compared to 32.3%), neutropenia (35.9% compared to 
25.6%), fatigue (30.1% compared to 17.3%), and back pain (22.3% compared to 10.5%). For 
information, in the azacitidine treatment group, 43.6% of subjects were < 75 years of age while 
56.4% of subjects were ≥75 years of age with less than 10% of subjects were ≥ 85 years 
(azacitidine n = 14). 
Furthermore, the Applicant provided the safety data related to age within the azacitidine and the CCR 
subgroups.  
Table 33. Summary of safety data according to European Medicines Agency-specified age groups 
(safety population) 
There is limited safety information available with azacitidine in patients ≥85 years (with 14 [5.9%] 
patients ≥85 years in AZA-AML-001 study; see SmPC section 4.8). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As clinically significant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on CYPs are unlikely, drug-drug 
interactions are not expected to influence the safety profile of azacitidine.

Discontinuation, dose interruptions and dose reduction due to adverse 
events 
In the azacitidine group, treatment was permanently discontinued for 46.6% of subjects, the dose 
was reduced for 3.4% of subjects, the treatment was interrupted for 49.2% of subjects, and the 
treatment was reduced and interrupted for 5.5% of subjects. Similar results were observed with 
low-dose cytarabine, with treatment permanently discontinued for 44.4% of subjects, the dose was 
reduced for 1.3% of subjects, the treatment was interrupted for 39.9% of subjects, and the 
treatment was reduced and interrupted for 4.6% of subjects. In the intensive chemotherapy group, 
the percentages of subjects who experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, to dose 
interruption and dose reduction and/or interruption was lower than in the other active treatment 
groups, being 26.2%, 4.8% and 9.5%, respectively (Table 7).  
Table 34 Summary of Significant Treatment-emergent Adverse Events in AZA AML 001 Study 
The most frequent TEAEs leading to azacitidine study drug discontinuation were AML (16.1%) and 
pneumonia (7.6%). For these subjects the frequency of haematological or gastrointestinal TEAEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation was 4.2% and 0.8% (from clinical study report), respectively.  
In the LDAC group the pattern of study drug discontinuation was more or less similar as for the 
azacitidine group with 5.9% discontinuations due to pneumonia and 18.3% due to AML. In the 
intensive chemotherapy group, the incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation was (more than) 
2-fold lower compared to other active treatment groups and the pattern of TEAEs somewhat 
different. In this respect, the TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation in the intensive 
chemotherapy group were primarily the infections and infestations (7.1%), but not pneumonia and 
no cases of AML was reported. In the BSC-only group there were no discontinuations reported. Action 
taken with study medication was not recorded for TEAEs occurring within the BSC only treatment 
group; thus there are no TEAEs reported as leading to Discontinuation in this treatment group. 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to dose reduction and/or interruption of azacitidine treatment were 
primarily haematological disorders, mainly neutropenia. Similar trends regarding pattern and 
incidence were noted for subjects treated with low-dose cytarabine. Relatively few or no dose 
reductions and/or interruptions were observed in the BSC-only and the intensive chemotherapy 
group, this is as expected considering the purpose and/or the duration of the treatments.

Action taken with study medication was not recorded for TEAEs occurring within the best supportive 
care only treatment group, and thus there are no TEAEs reported as leading to discontinuation in this 
treatment group. 
Low-dose cytarabine preselection group 
Within the low-dose cytarabine preselection group, the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation (≥ 5% of subjects) reported in subjects included pneumonia and AML. All 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported at comparable frequencies (<10% difference) 
between the azacitidine-treated subjects and the low-dose cytarabine treated subjects. 
Intensive chemotherapy preselection group 
Within the intensive chemotherapy preselection group the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to 
study discontinuation (≥ 5% of subjects) included AML, which was reported in 20.9% of 
azacitidine-treated subjects vs 0% in intensive chemotherapy-treated subjects. As described 
previously, subjects treated with intensive chemotherapy were unlikely to have an event of AML 
resulting in discontinuation of study treatment due to the relatively short treatment duration. All 
other TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported at comparable frequencies between the 
two treatment groups. 
Post-marketing experience 
The results from the PSUR indicate that the important identified risks are myelosuppression, 
haemorrhagic events, infections, renal failure, ischemic colitis, hepatic failure, ILD, anxiety, 
confusional state and insomnia, and tumour lysis syndrome. The important potential risks are other 
psychiatric disorders, malignancies (including injection site tumours), male infertility, prenatal 
developmental toxicity and cardiac events.  
As acknowledged by the Applicant, the important missing information for azacitidine are use in renal 
impairment, use in hepatic impairment, use in cardiac impairment, effect on QT-interval, interactions 
with other drugs (including cytotoxic), and use in children. 
• 
Investigator-initiated trials 
The safety profile observed with azacitidine in Study AZA-AML-001 and in the investigator-initiated 
trials is consistent with that previously observed and reported for Vidaza in the currently approved 
indications. In this respect, the events reported were generally similar, although differences in 
frequency were observed. This may be related to the fact that Celgene does not have access to the 
safety databases for these trials. In addition, the study designs, patient populations 
(inclusion/exclusion criteria), data collection methods, and treatment regimens varied widely with 
most of the studies evaluating azacitidine at various doses in various combinations with other 
treatments. 
Nevertheless, it can be agreed that the general pattern of SAEs reported from these non-Celgene 
sponsored AML studies appear to be consistent with the safety profile of azacitidine and do not 
suggest any new safety issues with azacitidine. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Azacitidine has been marketed and widely used for the approved indications of higher-risk MDS and 
AML 20% to 30% blasts since 2004, with an estimated 216,066 patients treated. In the pivotal trial 
of this MAA, a total of 471 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 61/74 
 
  
  
safety assessment (at least 1 post-randomization safety assessment for BSC only), and were thus 
evaluable for safety analyses. This safety population included 236 subjects in the azacitidine group, 
40 subjects in the BSC-only group, 153 subjects in the low-dose cytarabine group, and 42 subjects in 
the intensive chemotherapy group. The majority of subjects in the overall study population (60.1%) 
were classified as AML not otherwise specified. The other WHO AML subtypes were AML with 
myelodysplasia-related changes (32.7%), therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (4.2%), and AML with 
recurrent genetic abnormalities (3.0%). Furthermore, the duration of exposure (in person-years) 
was longer in the azacitidine group than in the other treatment subgroups. Within each of the 
investigator’s choice preselection treatment groups, the median duration of exposure, median 
duration of treatment, and treatment exposure in person-years were also longer in the 
azacitidine-treated subjects compared to each individual CCR treatment group (i.e., best supportive 
care, low-dose cytarabine, or intensive chemotherapy).  
Most of the patients included in the study did not have a dose modification, irrespective of the type of 
study arm/CCR subgroup. In the azacitidine treatment group, the main reason for dose modifications 
was haematological toxicity and for the CCR subgroups, this was classified as “other”. Overall, the 
azacitidine and combined CCR treatment groups were comparable for baseline demographic and 
disease characteristics, except for the number of prior anti-cancer systemic therapies, which was in 
favour of the azacitidine arm.  
Regarding the most common TEAEs, in the azacitidine group these involved gastrointestinal disorders 
(mainly constipation, nausea, and diarrhoea), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(mainly pyrexia), and haematological disorders (mainly febrile neutropenia and neutropenia). This 
would be consistent with the underlying disease and the known pharmacology of azacitidine.  
Regarding the occurrence of AML during the study, apparently this was the lowest in the intensive 
chemotherapy CCR subgroup. However, when all information was combined, the overall frequency of 
all AML events appeared similar between all treatment groups. 
The risks for infection and myelosuppression were not unexpected considering the known safety 
profile of azacitidine and the patient population at hand. Also, the events appeared manageable with 
dose adjustment, dose delay, and supportive treatment. 
The pattern of serious TEAEs, of Grade 3 or 4 serious TEAEs, of common AEs and treatment-related 
AEs was more or less the same between the azacitidine and the individual CCR, also between the 
respective treatment groups, with the most frequently occurring events being febrile neutropenia, 
pneumonia and AML.  
Within the investigator choice preselection CCR subgroups, the data further show that in 
azacitidine-treated subjects, the TEAEs from these SOCs were reported at a higher frequency (>10% 
difference) compared to the best supportive care only subjects, and at a similar frequency compared 
to low-dose cytarabine subjects, except for Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (i.e. 50.3% 
azacitidine vs 39.2% low-dose cytarabine),Gastrointestinal disorders (i.e. 81.5% azacitidine vs 
69.9% low- dose cytarabine) and General Disorders (i.e. 82.8% azacitidine vs 71.2% low- dose 
cytarabine).  
Compared to intensive chemotherapy subjects, TEAES were reported: 
- at similar frequencies (<10% difference) for the SOCs Blood and lymphatic system disorders, 
Gastrointestinal Disorders, Infections and infestations, Investigations, Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, Vascular disorders, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, Renal and urinary disorders, 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and  
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 62/74 
 
  
  
-more frequently (>10% difference) for the SOCs General disorders and administration site 
conditions, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, Neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (incl cysts and polyps), Nervous system disorders, Psychiatric disorders, relative to the 
azacitidine treatment group.  
It is acknowledged that when adjusted for duration of exposure, the incidence rates for TEAEs in 
these SOCs in the azacitidine-treated subjects were either similar (vs low-dose cytarabine) or lower 
(vs best supportive care or intensive chemotherapy). However, correction for the duration of the 
treatment/exposure does not seem to be appropriate when comparing the safety profile between 
study treatments as this does not represent the actual incidence of (TE)AES in relation to the 
respective treatment and thereby the clinical situation. 
Similar pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment death rates were reported in the 3 active 
treatment groups despite the longer treatment duration for azacitidine subjects. Furthermore, the 
pattern of primary causes of death as reported by the investigator’s in the azacitidine vs the 
individual CCR groups is similar as observed for the TEAEs leading to death and this points at these 
data being consistent. The causes of death were seemingly similar between the azacitidine and the 
CCR subgroups.  
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to reduction and/or interruption of azacitidine treatment were 
primarily haematological disorders, mainly neutropenia. Similar trends regarding pattern and 
incidence were noted for subjects treated with low-dose cytarabine. Relatively few or no dose 
reductions and/or interruptions were observed in the BSC-only and the intensive chemotherapy 
group. These data indicate that the treatments were tolerable for the patients studied. 
Regarding the safety data from other sources, the risks of azacitidine treatment seem to remain 
consistent across all sources and relate primarily to the known pharmacology of azacitidine and 
include myelosuppression and associated infections and gastrointestinal toxicities. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Azacitidine was generally well tolerated in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML, with bone 
marrow blast count > 30%, and who were not eligible for HSCT. No new risks of azacitidine were 
identified. Based on the available data, azacitidine showed a well-known safety profile of azacitidine 
that although acceptable, may be less favourable in comparison to best supportive care, comparable 
to low dose cytarabine and less favourable or similar to the intensive chemotherapy regimen.  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- the changes to the patient information leaflet are minimal and do not constitute any of the 
categories that require a new consultation in addition to the testing that have already been 
performed (in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended). 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The current Type II variation seeks approval for a new indication: “Vidaza is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible for HSCT with AML with >30% 
marrow blasts according to WHO classification.”  
The efficacy claims of this application are supported by the efficacy results of a Phase 3, international, 
multicenter, controlled study with an open-label, randomized, parallel-group design conducted by 
the MAH (Study AZA-AML-001).  
The primary objective of the pivotal study was to demonstrate superiority in overall survival of 
azacitidine (n=241) compared to combined conventional care regimens (CCR) (n=247) as treatment 
of elderly AML patients (≥ 65 years of age) with > 30% bone marrow blasts (according to WHO 
criteria) that were not eligible for HSCT. The secondary endpoints were 1-year overall survival rate, 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 70/74 
 
  
  
event free survival (EFS), relapse free survival (RFS), remission rate (CR + CRincomplete (CRi)), 
duration of remission (CR + CRi), cytogenetic complete remission rate (CRc), Safety / tolerability, 
EORTC QLQ-C30), and Measures of healthcare resource utilization. The chosen primary and 
secondary endpoints fit the overall aim of the study.  
Together, the design of the study served the objectives of the study and the patient and disease 
characteristics define an appropriate patient population to evaluate the efficacy of azacitidine vs CCR 
in the pivotal study. 
After a median follow-up time of 24.4 months, the median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI = 8.0, 12.7) 
in the azacitidine group (N = 241) compared with 6.5 months (95% CI = 5.0, 8.6) in the combined 
CCR group with an observed difference in median OS of 3.8 months. The OS HR for the azacitidine 
group vs CCR was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.69, 1.03). The difference between survival curves based on the 
log-rank test did not reach the predefined level of significance (log rank test, with a stratified p = 
0.1009). Analysis of pre-specified subgroups showed a consistent trend for OS advantage in favour of 
azacitidine across subgroups, which reached statistical significance in patients with poor cytogenetic 
risk, patients with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, patients younger than 75 years, 
female, or white.  
The clearest difference between the study arms in terms of the secondary endpoints was observed in 
the 1-year survival rate with an improvement of 12.3% (95% CI = 3.5, 21.0) in the estimate for the 
azacitidine group (46.5% [95% CI = 40.1, 52.7]) versus the combined CCR group (34.3% [95% CI 
= 28.3, 40.3]). In addition, there was a suggestion of a trend towards an improved median EFS with 
azacitidine compared to the combined CCR treatment group (6.7 months versus 4.8 months 
respectively). No differences were noted between the experimental and the control arm for the other 
secondary endpoints on disease control, i.e. haematologic response, morphologic response, RFS and 
duration of remission. Rates of conversion of subjects from RBC transfusion dependence to RBC 
transfusion independence, and from platelet transfusion dependence to platelet transfusion 
independence tended to be in favour of azacitidine. 
Planned exploratory analyses based on investigator’s preselection for CCR showed that, within the 
treatment selection group, the median OS was longer in the azacitidine treated groups for the 
subjects selected for BSC (5.8 versus 3.7 months; p = 0.0288), or low-dose cytarabine, but the latter 
was not significant (11.2 versus 6.4 months; p = 0.4270). Survival was similar in the intensive 
chemotherapy choice groups (13.3 for azacitidine versus 12.2 months for chemotherapy; p = 
0.5032). 
Considering the heterogeneity of the study population, the slight imbalances of the key baseline 
characteristics within the CCR treatment groups and the fact that several of these baseline 
characteristics are interdependent, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was applied 
to adjust for established patient- and disease-related, pre-specified baseline prognostic factors. The 
analysis resulted in an OS HR for azacitidine versus CCR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99), with a 20% 
reduction of the risk of death and a nominal p-value below 0.05 (p = 0.0355). 
Regarding the impact of baseline factors on OS results in subgroups within the preselection groups, 
the following results were observed: 
Best supportive care - there was a consistent trend in OS benefit (as measured in OS HR) across the 
subgroups in favour of azacitidine compared with best supportive care; this was seemingly a more 
favourable pattern as observed in the ITT; 
Low dose cytarabine - there seems to be a consistent trend in OS benefit (as measured in OS HR) 
across the subgroups in favour of azacitidine compared with low-dose cytarabine when looking at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015 
Page 71/74 
 
  
  
OS HR point-estimates, though the trend was weaker as observed in the best-supportive care group. 
The pattern was more or less similar to what was observed with the ITT population. 
The number of subjects in the individual prespecified subgroups relating to baseline factors within the 
preselection groups is small. This implies that caution should be applied when drawing conclusions on 
the OS HR results in this setting. This is in particular relevant for the preselection group of intensive 
chemotherapy. Nevertheless, in view of the consistent effect, it is possible to conclude that efficacy 
has been established and that the effect on OS associated with azacitidine is of a similar magnitude 
compared to low-dose cytarabine and intensive chemotherapy, and improved compared to best 
supportive care. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Due to the (inherent) limitations that accompany HRQoL assessment (i.e. patient not completing the 
questionnaires as scheduled) and because the decrease in number of evaluations in time differed 
between treatment groups, clear conclusions cannot be drawn. Thus, the impact of treatment on 
HRQoL remains uncertain. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.1). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common serious adverse reactions (≥10%) noted from AZA-AML-001 within the 
azacitidine treatment arm included febrile neutropenia (25.0%), pneumonia (20.3%), and pyrexia 
(10.6%). Other less frequently reported serious adverse reactions in the azacitidine treatment arm 
included sepsis (5.1%), anaemia (4.2%), neutropenic sepsis (3.0%), urinary tract infection (3.0%), 
thrombocytopenia (2.5%), neutropenia (2.1%), cellulitis (2.1%), dizziness (2.1%) and dyspnoea 
(2.1%). 
The most commonly reported (≥30%) adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were 
gastrointestinal events, including constipation (41.9%), nausea (39.8%), and diarrhoea (36.9%), 
(usually Grade 1-2),  general disorders and administration site conditions including pyrexia (37.7%; 
usually Grade 1-2) and  haematological events, including febrile neutropenia (32.2%) and 
neutropenia (30.1%), (usually Grade 3-4).  
Regarding the occurrence of AML during the study, this is the lowest in the intensive chemotherapy 
CCR subgroup (i.e. 2.4% vs 20.8% azacitidine vs 32.5% BSC vs 24.2% LDAC). 
The review of the TEAEs of special interest showed that the risks for infection and myelosuppression 
were not unexpected considering the known safety profile of azacitidine and the patient population at 
hand. Also, the events appeared manageable with dose adjustment, dose delay, and supportive 
treatment. 
The pattern of serious TEAEs, of Grade 3 or 4 serious TEAEs, of common AEs and treatment-related 
AEs was more or less the same between the Azacitidine and the individual CCR, also between the 
respective treatment groups, with the most frequently occurring events being febrile neutropenia, 
pneumonia and AML. 
Most TEAEs were reported in the SOCs General disorders and administration site conditions, 
Gastrointestinal disorders, Infections and infestations, and Blood and lymphatic system disorders. 
Compared to intensive chemotherapy subjects, TEAEs were reported similar to more frequent in 
differential SOCs. Not adjusting for the duration of treatment showed a safety profile of azacitidine to 
be less favourable in comparison to best supportive care, comparable to low dose cytarabine and less 
favourable to similar to the intensive chemotherapy regimen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/757391/2015

Regarding the safety data from other sources, the risks of azacitidine treatment seem to remain 
consistent across all sources and relate primarily to the known pharmacology of azacitidine and 
include gastrointestinal toxicities and myelosuppression and associated infections. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The interpretation of the data regarding the fatal TEAE and TEAE in the azacitidine group in the oldest 
age group (>85 years), is hampered by the limited number of patients in this category (this has been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.8). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The majority of older patients with AML should be offered definitive anti-leukaemic therapy to prolong 
both duration and quality of life remaining. Performance status, comorbidities, disease biology, 
quality of life (QoL), and long-term treatment goals should all be considered in the selection of the 
most appropriate therapeutic approach for each patient. OS is an important endpoint in this disease. 
Based on the data submitted, it is possible to conclude that efficacy has been established and that the 
effect on OS associated with azacitidine is of a similar magnitude compared to low-dose cytarabine 
and intensive chemotherapy, and improved compared to best supportive care. 
Azacitidine was generally well tolerated in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML, with bone 
marrow blast count > 30%, and who were not eligible for HSCT. No new risks of azacitidine were 
identified. Based on the available data, azacitidine showed the well-known safety profile of 
azacitidine that, although acceptable, may be less favourable in comparison to best supportive care, 
comparable to low dose cytarabine and less favourable or similar to the intensive chemotherapy 
regimen. Although some of the toxicity associated with azacitidine was higher compared to intensive 
chemotherapy, azacitidine was generally well-tolerated. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the effect on OS associated with azacitidine, which is of a similar magnitude compared to 
low-dose cytarabine and intensive chemotherapy, and improved compared to best supportive care, 
and the fact that azacitidine is generally well-tolerated and has a well-known and manageable safety 
profile, the benefits outweigh the risks for the treatment of adult patients aged 65 years or older who 
are not eligible for HSCT with AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a heterogeneous disease in terms of response to treatment and overall 
survival. Prognostic factors that contribute to this heterogeneity can be both patient and disease 
related, including blasts counts. The new indication for azacitidine aims to extend the current 
indication into elderly AML patients with >30% blasts. This population would represent patients with 
a different stage of the disease and who have a greater incidence of poor prognostics factors, 
implying a greater severity of disease with poorer outcomes, as compared to the authorized AML 
indication for Vidaza in the EU. 
Given the poor overall outcome and high treatment-related mortality in older AML patients, some 
physicians do not pursue aggressive induction therapy, opting for less aggressive therapies. 
Treatment options are few for patients who choose not to receive intensive chemotherapy or are 
considered ineligible (unfit) to receive intensive chemotherapy by their physician. Patients 
considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy are generally patients older than 75 years or those

60 to 75 years old with significant co-morbidities, poor performance status, or with complex 
cytogenetic abnormalities.

Extension of Indication to add treatment of adult patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible 
for HSCT with AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification, based on the 
pivotal phase III study AZA- AML-001. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. A revised 
RMP version 12.0 was agreed during the procedure.  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is by consensus of the opinion that Vidaza is not similar to Ceplene and Dacogen within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions 
of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies

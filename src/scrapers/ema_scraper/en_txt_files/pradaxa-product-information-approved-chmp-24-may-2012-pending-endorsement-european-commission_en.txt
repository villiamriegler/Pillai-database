CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective 
total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 
Patients following elective knee replacement surgery 
The recommended dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg once daily taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg. Treatment 
should be initiated orally within 1-4 hours of completed surgery with a single capsule and continuing 
with 2 capsules once daily thereafter for a total of 10 days. 
Patients following elective hip replacement surgery 
The recommended dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg once daily taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg. Treatment 
should be initiated orally within 1-4 hours of completed surgery with a single capsule and continuing 
with 2 capsules once daily thereafter for a total of 28-35 days. 
For the following groups the recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 150 mg taken once daily as 
2 capsules of 75 mg: 
 
Patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance, CrCL 30-50 ml/min) [see Renal 
impairment (prevention of VTE)] 
Patients who receive concomitant verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine [see Concomitant use of 
Pradaxa with strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. amidarone, quinidine or verapamil 
(prevention of VTE)] 
Patients aged 75 or above [see Elderly (prevention of VTE)] 


For both surgeries, if haemostasis is not secured, initiation of treatment should be delayed. If treatment 
is not started on the day of surgery then treatment should be initiated with 2 capsules once daily. 
Assessment of renal function (prevention of VTE): 
In all patients: 
 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. 
CrCL < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Pradaxa is contraindicated in patients with 
severe renal impairment 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications) 
 
The method used to estimate renal function (CrCL in ml/min) during the clinical development of 
Pradaxa was the Cockgroft-Gault method. The formula is as follows: 
  For creatinine in mol/l: 
1.23  (140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
serum creatinine [mol/l] 
  For creatinine in mg/dl: 
(140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
   72  serum creatinine [mg/dl] 
This method is recommended when assessing patients’ CrCL prior to and during Pradaxa treatment. 
Renal impairment (prevention of VTE) 
Treatment with Pradaxa in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 ml/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min), there is limited clinical experience. 
These patients should be treated with caution. The recommended dose is 150 mg taken once daily as 2 
capsules of 75 mg (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Concomitant use of Pradaxa with strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. amiodarone, quinidine 
or verapamil (prevention of VTE) 
Dosing should be reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg Pradaxa in patients who 
receive concomitantly dabigatran etexilate and amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil (see sections 4.4 
and 4.5). In this situation Pradaxa and these medicinal products should be taken at the same time. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with dabigatran etexilate and 
verapamil, a dose reduction of Pradaxa to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elderly(prevention of VTE) 
In elderly patients (> 75 years) there is limited clinical experience. These patients should be treated 
with caution. The recommended dose is 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). 
As renal impairment may be frequent in the elderly (>75 years), renal function should be assessed by 
calculating the CrCL prior to initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal 
impairment (i.e. CrCL < 30 ml/min). While on treatment the renal function should also be assessed in 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such 
as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain comedications, etc) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment (prevention of VTE) 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded in clinical trials 
investigating the VTE prevention following elective hip or knee replacement surgery. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not 
recommended in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Weight (prevention of VTE) 
There is very limited clinical experience in patients with a body weight < 50 kg or > 110 kg at the 
recommended posology. Given the available clinical and kinetic data no adjustment is necessary (see 
section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Gender (prevention of VTE) 
Given the available clinical and kinetic data, no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Switching (prevention of VTE) 
Pradaxa treatment to parenteral anticoagulant 
It is recommended to wait 24 hours after the last dose before switching from Pradaxa to a parenteral 
anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to Pradaxa 
Dabigatran etexilate should be given 0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate 
therapy would be due, or at the time of discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. 
intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see section 4.5). 
Paediatric population (prevention of VTE) 
There is no relevant use of Pradaxa in the paediatric population in the indication: primary prevention 
of venous thromboembolic events in patients who have undergone elective total hip replacement 
surgery or total knee replacement surgery. 
Pradaxa is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and 
efficacy. 
Missed dose (prevention of VTE) 
It is recommended to continue with the remaining daily doses of dabigatran etexilate at the same time 
of the next day. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Method of administration (prevention of VTE) 
Pradaxa should be swallowed as a whole with water, with or without food. 
Patients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see 
sections 5.2 and 6.6).

Lesion or condition at significant risk of major bleeding such as current or recent 
gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial 
haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular 
aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities 
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g. unfractionated heparin, low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), 
oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under the circumstances of 
switching therapy to or from Pradaxa (see section 4.2) 
Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival 
Concomitant treatment with systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole and tacrolimus 
(see section 4.5) 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 ULN were excluded in controlled clinical trials investigating 
the VTE prevention following elective hip or knee replacement surgery. No treatment experience is 
available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not recommended in 
this population. 
Haemorrhagic risk 
As with all anticoagulants, dabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an 
increased risk of bleeding and in situations with concomitant use of drugs affecting haemostasis. 
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with dabigatran. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin 
and/or haematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
Factors, such as decreased renal function (30-50 ml/min CrCL), age ≥ 75 years, low body weight 
< 50 kg, or strong P-gp inhibitor co-medication (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil) are 
associated with increased dabigatran plasma levels (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2). 
Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or non steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), as 
well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux requiring proton pump 
inhibitors (PPI) or histamine 2 (H2)-blocker treatment increase the risk of GI bleeding. The 
administration of a PPI can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. 
Bleeding risk may be increased in patients concomitantly treated with selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see section 4.5). 
Close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is recommended throughout the 
treatment period, especially if risk factors are combined (see section 5.1). 
Table 1 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk. Please also refer to 
contraindications in section 4.3.

The presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which signficantly increase the risk of major bleeding 
requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Pradaxa should only be given if the benefit outweighs 
bleeding risks. 
Pradaxa does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring. However, the measurement of 
dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to avoid excessive high exposure to dabigatran in 
the presence of additional risk factors. The INR test is unreliable in patients on Pradaxa and false 
positive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. Diluted 
thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may 
provide useful information, but the tests are not standardized, and results should be interpreted with 
caution (see section 5.1).

Patients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue Pradaxa (see section 4.3). 
Limited data is available in patients < 50 kg (see section 5.2). 
When severe bleedings occur treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated 
(see section 4.9). 
Agents that may enhance the risk of haemorrhage should not be administered concomitantly or should 
be administered with caution with Pradaxa (see section 4.5). 
Interaction with P-gp inducers 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of P-gp inducers (such as rifampicin, St. John`s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma 
concentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Surgery and interventions 
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Therefore surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
Caution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and 
anticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency 
may take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such 
cases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still 
impaired.

If an acute intervention is required, dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery 
/ intervention should be delayed if possible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot 
be delayed the risk of bleeding may be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the 
urgency of intervention. 
Spinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture 
Procedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function. 
The risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture 
and by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least 
2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients 
require frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma. 
Post-surgical patients with an increased risk for bleeding 
Patients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with moderate renal 
impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Resume 
treatment after complete haemostasis is achieved. 
Patients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events 
There are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran available in these patients and therefore they 
should be treated with caution. 
Hip fracture surgery 
There is no data on the use of Pradaxa in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Therefore treatment 
is not recommended.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents 
The following treatments have not been studied and may increase the risk of bleeding when used 
concomitantly with Pradaxa: UFH, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives 
(fondaparinux, desirudin), thrombolytic agents, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, 
ticagrelor, dextran, sulfinpyrazone, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonists (see section 4.4). 
UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Clopidogrel: In a phase I study in young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of 
dabigatran etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times 
compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss and the 
coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation as measure of 
clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective 
mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40 % (see section 4.4). 
ASA: The effect of concomitant administration of dabigatran etexilate and ASA on the risk of bleeds 
was studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in a phase II study in which a randomized ASA 
co-administration was applied. Based on logistic regression analysis, co-administration of ASA and 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 
24 % with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4). 
NSAIDs: NSAIDs given for short-term perioperative analgesia have been shown not to be associated 
with increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With chronic use 
NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by approximately 50 % on both dabigatran etexilate and 
warfarin. Therefore, due to the risk of haemorrhage, notably with NSAIDs with elimination half-lives 
> 12 hours, close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended (see section 4.4). 
LMWH: The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not been 
specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily 40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 
24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after 
administration of dabigatran etexilate (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity 
was observed after dabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that 
after treatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over effect of 
enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-coagulation 
tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin. 
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile 
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran. 
Transporter interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of 
strong P-gp inhibitors (such as amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine, ketoconazole and clarithromycin) is 
expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.  
If not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or 
anaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. A coagulation 
test helps to identify patients with an increased bleeding risk due to increased dabigatran exposure (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole and tacrolimus are contraindicated (see section 
4.3). Caution should be exercised with other strong P-gp inhibitors (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine or 
verapamil) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values by 138 % and 135 %, 
respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and 153 % and 149 %, respectively, after multiple oral 
dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once daily. The time to peak, terminal half-life and mean residence 
time were not affected by ketoconazole (see section 4.4). Concomitant treatment with systemic 
ketoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Amiodarone: When Pradaxa was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg amiodarone, the 
extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active metabolite DEA were essentially 
unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were increased by about 60 % and 50 %, respectively. The 
mechanism of the interaction has not been completely clarified. In view of the long half-life of 
amiodarone the potential for drug interaction may exist for weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  
Patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery, dosing should be 
reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg Pradaxa if they receive concomitantly 
dabigatran etexilate and amiodarone (see section 4.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended 
when dabigatran etexilate is combined with amiodarone and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, 
notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Quinidine: Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1000 mg. 
Dabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day either with or 
without quinidine. Dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on average by 53 % and 56 %, 
respectively with concomitant quinidine (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery, dosing should be 
reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg Pradaxa if they receive concomitantly 
dabigatran etexilate and quinidine (see section 4.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended when 
dabigatran etexilate is combined with quinidine and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably 
in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Verapamil: When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the Cmax and 
AUC of dabigatran were increased but magnitude of this change differs depending on timing of 
administration and formulation of verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an immediate release 
formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax 
by about 180 % and AUC by about 150 %). The effect was progressively decreased with 
administration of an extended release formulation (increased of Cmax by about 90 % and AUC by about 
70 %) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increased of Cmax by about 60 % and AUC by 
about 50 %). 
Therefore, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is required when 
dabigatran is co-administered with verapamil. In patients with normal renal function after the hip or 
knee replacement surgery, receiving dabigatran etexilate and verapamil concomitantly, the dose of 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pradaxa should be reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg . In patients with 
moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with dabigatran etexilate and verapamil, a dose 
reduction of Pradaxa to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Close clinical 
surveillance is recommended when dabigatran etexilate is combined with verapamil and particularly in 
the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
There was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours after dabigatran 
etexilate (increased of Cmax by about 10 % and AUC by about 20 %). This is explained by completed 
dabigatran absorption after 2 hours (see section 4.4). 
Clarithromycin: When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with dabigatran 
etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 19 % and Cmax by about 15 % was observed 
without any clinical safety concern. However, in patients receiving dabigatran, a clinically relevant 
interaction cannot be excluded when combined with clarithromycin. Therefore, a close monitoring 
should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is combined with clarithromycin and particularly in the 
occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
The following potent P-gp inhibitors have not been clinically studied but from in vitro results a similar 
effect as with ketoconazole may be expected: 
Itraconazole, tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which are contra-indicated (see section 4.3). 
Neither clinical nor in vitro test results are available for posaconazole which is not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. Inadequate clinical data are available regarding the co-
administration of Pradaxa and dronedarone, and their co-administration is not recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of a P-gp inducer (such as rifampicin, St. John´s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran concentrations 
and should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Rifampicin: Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 7 days 
decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 and 67 %, respectively. The inducing effect 
was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of 
rifampicin treatment. No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days. 
Other drugs affecting P-gp 
Protease inhibitors including ritonavir and its combinations with other protease inhibitors affect P-gp 
(either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. 
P-gp substrate 
Digoxin: In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when Pradaxa was co-administered with 
digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinical relevant changes on dabigatran exposure have been 
observed. 
Co-medication with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin 
norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups.

Pantoprazole: When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve of approximately 30 % was observed. Pantoprazole and 
other proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and 
concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa. 
Ranitidine: Ranitidine administration together with Pradaxa had no clinically relevant effect on the 
extent of absorption of dabigatran. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Pradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding  
There are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast feeding. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa. 
Fertility 
No data human available. 
In animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations 
and an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure 
level compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence 
on male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5- to 10-fold higher plasma 
exposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an 
increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre- and post-natal study, an 
increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to 
a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
A total of 10.084 patients were treated in 4 actively controlled VTE prevention trials with at least one 
dose of the medicinal product. Of these 5419 were treated with 150 mg or 220 mg daily of Pradaxa, 
while 389 received doses less than 150 mg daily and 1168 received doses in excess of 220 mg daily. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are bleedings occurring in total in approximately 14 % 
of patients; the frequency of major bleeds (including wound site bleedings) is less than 2 %. 
Although rare in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of 
location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes. 
Adverse reactions  
Table 4 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of SOC and frequency using the following 
convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare

The definition of major bleeding events in the RE-NOVATE and RE-MODEL studies were as 
follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fatal bleeding 
clinically overt bleeding in excess of what was expected and associated with ≥ 20 g/l 
(corresponds to 1.24 mmol/l) fall in haemoglobin in excess of what was expected 
clinically overt bleeding in excess of what was expected and leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units 
packed cells or whole blood in excess of what was expected 
symptomatic retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular or intraspinal bleeding 
bleeding requiring treatment cessation 
bleeding leading to re-operation 
Objective testing was required for a retroperitoneal bleed (ultrasound or Computer Tomography (CT) 
scan) and for an intracranial and intraspinal bleed (CT scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging). 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses of dabigatran etexilate beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of 
bleeding. 
In case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the 
time by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional 
measures e.g. dialysis have been initiated. 
Excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of Pradaxa treatment. There is no specific antidote 
to dabigatran. In the event of haemorrhagic complications, treatment must be discontinued and the 
source of bleeding investigated. Since dabigatran is excreted predominantly by the renal route 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adequate diuresis must be maintained. Appropriate supportive treatment, such as surgical haemostasis 
and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the prescribers discretion.  
Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., FEIBA) or recombinant Factor VIIa or 
concentrates of coagulation factors II, IX and X, may be considered. There is some experimental 
evidence to support the role of these agents in reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data 
on their usefulness in clinical settings and also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is 
very limited. Coagulation tests may become unreliable following adminstration of suggested reversing 
agents. Caution should be exercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given 
to administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting 
antiplatelet drugs have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the 
physician's judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings. 
As protein binding is low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to 
demonstrate the utility of this approach in clinical studies (see section 5.2). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: direct thrombine inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07 
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma. 
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran also inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
In-vivo and ex-vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral 
administration in various animal models of thrombosis. 
There is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant 
effect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT. 
The calibrated diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma concentration that 
can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
The ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors. 
The aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation 
intensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable 
for precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran. High aPTT values should be interpreted with caution. 
In general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran 
levels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile 
of dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough is considered to be 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

Steady state (after day 3) geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 
2 hours after 220 mg dabigatran etexilate administration, was 70.8 ng/ml, with a range of 
35.2-162 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range).The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, 
measured at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 24 hours after a 220 mg dabigatran dose), was on 
average 22.0 ng/ml, with a range of 13.0-35.7 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range). 
In patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery with 220 mg 
dabigatran etexilate once daily, 
 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations was 67 ng/ml, measured at trough 
(20-28 hours after the previous dose) (see section 4.4 and 4.9), 
the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (20-28 hours after the previous dose) was 51 seconds, 
which would be 1.3-fold upper limit of normal. 
 
The ECT was not measured in patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement 
surgery with 220 mg dabigatran etexilate once daily. 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or 
Chinese patients were observed. 
Clinical trials in Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following major joint replacement 
surgery 
In 2 large randomized, parallel group, double-blind, dose-confirmatory trials, patients undergoing 
elective major orthopaedic surgery (one for knee replacement surgery and one for hip replacement 
surgery) received Pradaxa 75 mg or 110 mg within 1-4 hours of surgery followed by 150 mg or 
220 mg daily thereafter, haemostasis having been secured, or enoxaparin 40 mg on the day prior to 
surgery and daily thereafter.  
In the RE-MODEL trial (knee replacement) treatment was for 6-10 days and in the RE-NOVATE trial 
(hip replacement) for 28-35 days. Totals of 2076 patients (knee) and 3494 (hip) were treated 
respectively. 
Composite of total VTE (including PE, proximal and distal DVT, whatever symptomatic or 
asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and all-cause mortality constituted the primary 
end-point for both studies. Composite of major VTE (including PE and proximal DVT, whatever 
symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and VTE-related mortality constituted 
a secondary end-point and is considered of better clinical relevance. 
Results of both studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of Pradaxa 220 mg and 150 mg were 
statistically non-inferior to that of enoxaparin on total VTE and all-cause mortality. The point estimate 
for incidence of major VTE and VTE related mortality for the 150 mg dose was slightly worse than 
enoxaparin (table 6). Better results were seen with the 220 mg dose where the point estimate of Major 
VTE was slightly better than enoxaparin (table 6). 
The clinical studies have been conducted in a patient population with a mean age > 65 years. 
There were no differences in the phase 3 clinical studies for efficacy and safety data between men and 
women. 
In the studied patient population of RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE (5539 patients treated), 51 % 
suffered from concomitant hypertension, 9 % from concomitant diabetes, 9 % from concomitant 
coronary artery disease and 20 % had a history of venous insufficiency. None of these diseases 
showed an impact on the effects of dabigatran on VTE-prevention or bleeding rates. 
Data for the major VTE and VTE-related mortality endpoint were homogeneous with regards to the 
primary efficacy endpoint and are shown in table 6.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pradaxa in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of thromboembolic events in the 
granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, 
which is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. 
The absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa was approximately 
6.5 %. 
After oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran 
in plasma is characterized by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 
and 2.0 hours post administration. 
Absorption 
A study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, 
demonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth 
plasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to 
contributing factors such as anaesthesia, gastrointestinal paresis, and surgical effects independent of 
the oral medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed 
absorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran 
is rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration. 
Food does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma 
concentrations by 2 hours. 
The oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % compared to the reference capsule formulation 
when the pellets are taken without the Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, 
the integrity of the HPMC capsules should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally 
increased bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, patients should be advised not to open the 
capsules and taking the pellets alone (e.g. sprinkled over food or into beverages) (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was 
observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60–70 l exceeded the volume of total body 
water indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran. 
Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were dose proportional. Plasma 
concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of 11 hours 
in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was 
observed. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as 
shown in table 9. 
Metabolism and elimination 
Metabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived 
radioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the 
administered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose 
by 168 hours post dose.  
Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four 
positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical 
methods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of 
approximately 100 ml/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Renal insufficiency 
In phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of Pradaxa is 
approximately 2.7-fold higher in volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL between 
30-50 ml/min) than in those without renal insufficiency. 
In a small number of volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 ml/min), the exposure 
(AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately 2 times longer 
than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).

27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0) 
Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 ml/min dialysate flow rate, 
four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 ml/min or 350-390 ml/min. This resulted in a 
removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of drug cleared by 
dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 ml/min. The anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD relationship 
was not affected by the procedure. 
Elderly patients 
Specific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the 
AUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects. 
The effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % 
higher trough concentration for subjects ≥ 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects 
< 65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic insufficiency 
No change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child 
Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Body weight 
The dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in patients with a body weight > 100 kg 
compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ≥ 50 kg and < 100 kg 
category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in patients 
< 50 kg are available. 
Gender 
Active substance exposure in the primary VTE prevention studies was about 40 % to 50 % higher in 
female patients and no dose adjustment is recommended. 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic interactions  
The pro-drug dabigatran etexilate but not dabigatran is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. 
Therefore co-medications with P-gp transporter inhibitors (amiodarone, verapamil, clarithromycin, 
quinidine and ketoconazole) and inducers (rifampicin) had been investigated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.5). 
In vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of 
cytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not 
show any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin 
(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of dabigatran. 
An effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in 
pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were 
toxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body 
weight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the 
pre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the 
dams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
In lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of 
dabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.

Age ≥ 65 years associated with one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, 
or hypertension 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 
Patients following elective knee replacement surgery 
The recommended dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg once daily taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg. Treatment 
should be initiated orally within 1-4 hours of completed surgery with a single capsule and continuing 
with 2 capsules once daily thereafter for a total of 10 days. 
Patients following elective hip replacement surgery 
The recommended dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg once daily taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg. Treatment 
should be initiated orally within 1-4 hours of completed surgery with a single capsule and continuing 
with 2 capsules once daily thereafter for a total of 28-35 days. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the following groups the recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 150 mg taken once daily as 
2 capsules of 75 mg: 
 
Patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 30-50 ml/min) [see Renal 
impairment (prevention of VTE)] 
Patients who receive concomitant verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine [see Concomitant use of 
Pradaxa with strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. amidarone, quinidine or verapamil 
(prevention of VTE)] 
Patients aged 75 or above [see Elderly (prevention of VTE)] 
 
 
For both surgeries, if haemostasis is not secured, initiation of treatment should be delayed. If treatment 
is not started on the day of surgery then treatment should be initiated with 2 capsules once daily. 
Assessment of renal function (prevention of VTE): 
In all patients: 
 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. 
CrCL < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Pradaxa is contraindicated in patients with 
severe renal impairment 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications) 
 
The method used to estimate renal function (CrCL in ml/min) during the clinical development of 
Pradaxa was the Cockgroft-Gault method.The formula is as follows: 
  For creatinine in mol/l: 
1.23  (140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female)  
serum creatinine [mol/l] 
  For creatinine in mg/dl: 
(140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
   72  serum creatinine [mg/dl] 
This method is recommended when assessing patients’ CrCL prior to and during Pradaxa treatment. 
Renal impairment (prevention of VTE) 
Treatment with Pradaxa in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 ml/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min), there is limited clinical experience. 
These patients should be treated with caution. The recommended dose is 150 mg taken once daily as 2 
capsules of 75 mg (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Concomitant use of Pradaxa with strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. amiodarone, quinidine  
or verapamil (prevention of VTE) 
Dosing should be reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg Pradaxa in patients who 
receive concomitantly dabigatran etexilate and amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil (see sections 4.4 
and 4.5). In this situation Pradaxa and these medicinal products should be taken at the same time. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with dabigatran etexilate and 
verapamil, a dose reduction of Pradaxa to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly (prevention of VTE) 
In elderly patients (> 75 years) there is limited clinical experience. These patients should be treated 
with caution. The recommended dose is 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). 
As renal impairment may be frequent in the elderly (>75 years), renal function should be assessed by 
calculating the CrCL prior to initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal 
impairment (i.e. CrCL < 30 ml/min). While on treatment the renal function should also be assessed in 
certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such 
as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain comedications, etc) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment (prevention of VTE) 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded in clinical trials 
investigating the VTE prevention following elective hip or knee replacement surgery. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not 
recommended in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Weight (prevention of VTE) 
There is very limited clinical experience in patients with a body weight < 50 kg or > 110 kg at the 
recommended posology. Given the available clinical and kinetic data no adjustment is necessary (see 
section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Gender (prevention of VTE) 
Given the available clinical and kinetic data, no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Switching (prevention of VTE) 
Pradaxa treatment to parenteral anticoagulant 
It is recommended to wait 24 hours after the last dose before switching from Pradaxa to a parenteral 
anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to Pradaxa 
Dabigatran etexilate should be given 0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate 
therapy would be due, or at the time of discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. 
intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see section 4.5). 
Paediatric population (prevention of VTE) 
There is no relevant use of Pradaxa in the paediatric population in the indication: primary prevention 
of venous thromboembolic events in patients who have undergone elective total hip replacement 
surgery or total knee replacement surgery. 
Pradaxa is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and 
efficacy. 
Missed dose (prevention of VTE) 
It is recommended to continue with the remaining daily doses of dabigatran etexilate at the same time 
of the next day. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Prevention of stroke and SEE in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with one or more risk 
factors (SPAF) 
The recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. Therapy 
should be continued long term. 
For the following two groups the recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg taken as one 110 mg 
capsule twice daily: 
 
 
Patients aged 80 years or above 
Patients who receive concomitant verapamil 
For the following groups, the daily dose of Pradaxa of 300 mg or 220 mg should be selected based on 
an individual assessment of the thromboembolic risk and the risk of bleeding: 
 
 
 
 
Patients between 75-80 years 
Patients with moderate renal impairment 
Patients with gastritis, esophagitis or gastroesophageal reflux 
Other patients at increased risk of bleeding 
See further down and sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2. 
In case of intolerability to dabigatran, patients should be instructed to immediately consult their 
treating physician in order to be switched to alternate acceptable treatment options for prevention of 
stroke and SEE associated with atrial fibrillation. 
Elderly (SPAF) 
Patients between 75-80 years should be treated with a daily dose of 300 mg taken as one 150 mg 
capsule twice daily. A dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily can be individually 
considered, at the discretion of the physician, when the thromboembolic risk is low and the bleeding 
risk is high (see section 4.4). 
Patients aged 80 years or above should be treated with a daily dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg 
capsule twice daily due to the increased risk of bleeding in this population. 
As renal impairment may be frequent in the elderly (>75 years), renal function should be assessed by 
calculating the CrCL prior to initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal 
impairment (i.e. CrCL < 30 ml/min ). The renal function should also be assessed at least once a year in 
patients treated with Pradaxa or more frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is 
suspected that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and 
with certain comedications, etc) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients at risk of bleeding (SPAF) 
Patients with an increased bleeding risk (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2) should be closely 
monitored clinically (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia). Dose adjustment should be decided at 
the discretion of the physician, following assessment of the potential benefit and risk to an individual 
patient. A coagulation test (see section 4.4) may help to identify patients with an increased bleeding 
risk caused by excessive dabigatran exposure. When excessive dabigatran exposure is identified in 
patients at high risk of bleeding, a dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily is 
recommended. When clinically relevant bleeding occurs, treatment should be interrupted. 
For subjects with gastritis, esophagitis, or gastroesophageal reflux, the dose of 220 mg taken as one 
110 mg capsule twice daily may be considered due to the elevated risk of major gastro-intestinal 
bleeding (see section 4.4).

Assessment of renal function (SPAF): 
In all patients: 
 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. 
CrCL <  30 ml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Pradaxa is contraindicated in patients with 
severe renal impairment 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications) 
 
Additional requirements in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and in patients aged over 
75 years: 
 
Renal function should be assessed during treatment with Pradaxa at least once a year or more 
frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal function 
could decline or deteriorate (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications) 
The method used to estimate renal function (CrCL in ml/min) during the clinical development of 
Pradaxa was the Cockgroft-Gault method. The formula is as follows: 
  For creatinine in mol/l: 
1.23  (140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
serum creatinine [mol/l] 
  For creatinine in mg/dl: 
(140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
   72  serum creatinine [mg/dl] 
This method is recommended when assessing patients’ CrCL prior to and during Pradaxa treatment. 
Renal impairment (SPAF) 
Treatment with Pradaxa in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 ml/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCL 50- ≤ 80 ml/min). For 
patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min) the recommended dose of Pradaxa is 
also 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. However, for patients with high risk of 
bleeding, a dose reduction of Pradaxa to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily should be 
considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with 
renal impairment. 
Concomitant use of Pradaxa with strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. amiodarone, quinidine 
or verapamil (SPAF) 
No dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of amiodarone or quinidine (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.2). 
Dosing should be reduced to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily in patients who receive 
concomitantly dabigatran etexilate and verapamil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation Pradaxa 
and verapamil should be taken at the same time. 
Weight (SPAF) 
Given the available clinical and kinetic data, no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2), but 
close clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with a body weight < 50 kg (see section 4.4). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender (SPAF) 
Given the available clinical and kinetic data, no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment (SPAF) 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded in the study 
investigating the prevention of stroke and SEE associated with atrial fibrillation. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not 
recommended in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Switching (SPAF) 
Pradaxa treatment to parenteral anticoagulant 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to Pradaxa 
Dabigatran etexilate should be given 0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate 
therapy would be due, or at the time of discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. 
intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see section 4.5). 
Pradaxa treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) 
Adjust the starting time of the VKA based on CrCL as follows: 
 
 
CrCL ≥ 50 ml/min, start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate 
CrCL ≥ 30-< 50 ml/min, start VKA 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate 
Because Pradaxa can contribute to an elevated INR, INR testing should not be performed until 
Pradaxa has been stopped for at least 2 days. 
VKA to Pradaxa 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the International 
Normalized Ratio (INR) is < 2.0. 
Cardioversion (SPAF) 
Patients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. 
Paediatric population (SPAF) 
There is no relevant use of Pradaxa in the paediatric population in the indication: prevention of stroke 
and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 
Pradaxa is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and 
efficacy.  
Missed dose (SPAF) 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. 
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose on, the missed dose should be omitted. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration (prevention of VTE and SPAF) 
Pradaxa should be swallowed as a whole with water, with or without food. 
Patients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see 
sections 5.2 and 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.2) 
Active clinically significant bleeding 
Lesion or condition at significant risk of major bleeding such as current or recent 
gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial 
haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular 
aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities 
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g. unfractionated heparin, low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), 
oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under the circumstances of 
switching therapy to or from Pradaxa (see section 4.2) 
Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival 
Concomitant treatment with systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole and tacrolimus 
(see section 4.5) 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 ULN were excluded in controlled clinical trials investigating 
the VTE prevention following elective hip or knee replacement surgery as well as in the study 
investigating the prevention of stroke and SEE associated with atrial fibrillation. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not 
recommended in this population.  
Haemorrhagic risk 
As with all anticoagulants, dabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an 
increased risk of bleeding and in situations with concomitant use of drugs affecting haemostasis. 
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with dabigatran. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin 
and/or haematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
Factors, such as decreased renal function (30-50 ml/min CrCL), age ≥ 75 years, low body weight 
< 50 kg, or strong P-gp inhibitor co-medication (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil) are 
associated with increased dabigatran plasma levels (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2). 
In a study of prevention of stroke and SEE in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 
Dabigatran was associated with higher rates of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding which was 
statistically significant for dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily. This increased risk was seen in the 
elderly (≥ 75 years). Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or non steroidal antiinflammatory 
drug (NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux requiring 
proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or histamine 2 (H2)-blocker treatment increase the risk of GI bleeding. In 
these atrial fibrillationpatients a dosage of 220 mg dabigatran given as 110 mg capsule twice daily 
should be considered and posology recommendations in section 4.2 be followed. The administration of 
a PPI can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bleeding risk may be increased in patients concomitantly treated with selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see section 4.5). 
Close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is recommended throughout the 
treatment period, especially if risk factors are combined (see section 5.1). 
Table 1 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk. Please also refer to 
contraindications in section 4.3.

reflux 
The presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major 
bleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Pradaxa should only be given if the benefit 
outweighs bleeding risks. 
Pradaxa does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring. However, the measurement of 
dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to avoid excessive high exposure to dabigatran in 
the presence of additional risk factors. The INR test is unreliable in patients on Pradaxa and false 
positive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. Diluted 
thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may 
provide useful information, but the tests are not standardized, and results should be interpreted with 
caution (see section 5.1).

(see section 5.1) 
Patients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue Pradaxa (see section 4.3). 
Limited data is available in patients < 50 kg (see section 5.2).  
When severe bleedings occur treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated 
(see section 4.9). 
Agents that may enhance the risk of haemorrhage should not be administered concomitantly or should 
be administered with caution with Pradaxa (see section 4.5). 
Use of fibrinolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
The use of fibrinolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be considered if the 
patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the ULN according to the local reference 
range. 
Interaction with P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of P-gp inducers (such as rifampicin, St. John`s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma 
concentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Surgery and interventions 
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Therefore surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
Caution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and 
anticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency 
may take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such 
cases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still 
impaired.

Table 3 summarizes discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures.

If an acute intervention is required, dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery 
/ intervention should be delayed if possible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot 
be delayed the risk of bleeding may be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the 
urgency of intervention (for cardioversion see section 4.2). 
Spinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture 
Procedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture 
and by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least 
2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients 
require frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma. 
Post-surgical patients with an increased risk for bleeding 
Patients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with moderate renal 
impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Resume 
treatment after complete haemostasis is achieved. 
Patients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events 
There are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran available in these patients and therefore they 
should be treated with caution. 
Hip fracture surgery 
There is no data on the use of Pradaxa in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Therefore treatment 
is not recommended. 
Myocardial Infarction 
In the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1.) the overall rate of myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.82, 
0.81, and 0.64 % / year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice 
daily and warfarin, respectively, an increase in relative risk for dabigatran of 29 % and 27 % compared 
to warfarin. Irrespective of therapy, the highest absolute risk of MI was seen in the following 
subgroups, with similar relative risk: patients with previous MI, patients ≥ 65 years with either 
diabetes or coronary artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, and patients 
with moderate renal dysfunction. Furthermore a higher risk of MI was seen in patients concomitantly 
taking ASA plus clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone. 
Colorants 
Pradaxa hard capsules contain the colorant sunset yellow (E110), which may cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents 
The following treatments have not been studied and may increase the risk of bleeding when used 
concomitantly with Pradaxa: UFH, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives 
(fondaparinux, desirudin), thrombolytic agents, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, 
ticagrelor, dextran, sulfinpyrazone, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonists (see section 4.4). 
UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Only limited data on concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate and other anticoagulants are available, 
and no firm conclusions can be drawn. From the limited data collected in the phase III study RE-LY in 
patients with atrial fibrillation it was observed that the concomitant use of other oral or parenteral 
anticoagulants increases major bleeding rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin by 
approximately 2.5-fold, mainly related to situations when switching from one anticoagulant to another 
(see section 4.3). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clopidogrel and ASA: From the data collected in the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1) it was 
observed that the concomitant use of antiplatelets, ASA or clopidogrel approximately doubles major 
bleeding rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin (see section 4.4). 
Clopidogrel: In a phase I study in young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of 
dabigatran etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times 
compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss and the 
coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation as measure of 
clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective 
mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40 % (see section 4.4) (see also subsection on ASA below). 
ASA: The effect of concomitant administration of dabigatran etexilate and ASA on the risk of bleeds 
was studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in a phase II study in which a randomized ASA 
co-administration was applied. Based on logistic regression analysis, co-administration of ASA and 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 
24 % with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4).  
NSAIDs: NSAIDs given for short-term perioperative analgesia have been shown not to be associated 
with increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With chronic use in 
the RE-LY study, NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by approximately 50 % on both dabigatran 
etexilate and warfarin. Therefore, due to the risk of haemorrhage, notably with NSAIDs with 
elimination half-lives > 12 hours, close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended (see section 
4.4). 
LMWH: The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not been 
specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily 40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 
24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after 
administration of dabigatran etexilate (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity 
was observed after dabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that 
after treatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over effect of 
enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-coagulation 
tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin. 
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile 
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran. 
Transporter interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of 
strong P-gp inhibitors (such as amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine, ketoconazole and clarithromycin) is 
expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.  
If not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or 
anaemia) 
is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. A coagulation test helps to 
identify patients with an increased bleeding risk due to increased dabigatran exposure (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole and tacrolimus are contraindicated (see section 
4.3). Caution should be exercised with other strong P-gp inhibitors (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine or 
verapamil) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values by 138 % and 135 %, 
respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and 153 % and 149 %, respectively, after multiple oral 
dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once daily. The time to peak, terminal half-life and mean residence 
time were not affected by ketoconazole (see section 4.4). Concomitant treatment with systemic 
ketoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Amiodarone: When Pradaxa was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg amiodarone, the 
extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active metabolite DEA were essentially 
unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were increased by about 60 % and 50 %, respectively. The 
mechanism of the interaction has not been completely clarified. In view of the long half-life of 
amiodarone the potential for drug interaction may exist for weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery, dosing should be 
reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg Pradaxa if they receive concomitantly 
dabigatran etexilate and amiodarone (see section 4.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended 
when dabigatran etexilate is combined with amiodarone and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, 
notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Quinidine: Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1000 mg. 
Dabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day either with or 
without quinidine. Dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on average by 53 % and 56 %, 
respectively with concomitant quinidine (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery, dosing should be 
reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg Pradaxa if they receive concomitantly 
dabigatran etexilate and quinidine (see section 4.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended when 
dabigatran etexilate is combined with quinidine and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably 
in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Verapamil: When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the Cmax and 
AUC of dabigatran were increased but magnitude of this change differs depending on timing of 
administration and formulation of verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an immediate release 
formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax 
by about 180 % and AUC by about 150 %). The effect was progressively decreased with 
administration of an extended release formulation (increased of Cmax by about 90 % and AUC by about 
70 %) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increased of Cmax by about 60 % and AUC by 
about 50 %). 
Therefore, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is required when 
dabigatran is co-administered with verapamil. In patients with normal renal function after hip or knee 
replacement surgery, receiving dabigatran etexilate and verapamil concomitantly, the dose of Pradaxa 
should be reduced to 150 mg taken once daily as 2 capsules of 75 mg. In patients with moderate renal 
impairment and concomitantly treated with dabigatran etexilate and verapamil, a dose reduction of 
Pradaxa to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
For patients with atrial nonvalvular fibrillation treated for prevention of stroke and SEE, 
concomitantly receiving dabigatran etexilate and verapamil, the dose of Pradaxa should be reduced to 
220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily (see section 4.2).  
Close clinical surveillance is recommended when dabigatran etexilate is combined with verapamil and 
particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal 
impairment. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours after dabigatran 
etexilate (increased of Cmax by about 10 % and AUC by about 20 %). This is explained by completed 
dabigatran absorption after 2 hours (see section 4.4). 
Clarithromycin: When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with dabigatran 
etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 19 % and Cmax by about 15 % was observed 
without any clinical safety concern. However, in patients receiving dabigatran, a clinically relevant 
interaction cannot be excluded when combined with clarithromycin. Therefore, a close monitoring 
should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is combined with clarithromycin and particularly in the 
occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
The following potent P-gp inhibitors have not been clinically studied but from in vitro results a similar 
effect as with ketoconazole may be expected: 
Itraconazole, tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which are contra-indicated (see section 4.3). 
Neither clinical nor in vitro test results are available for posaconazole which is not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. Inadequate clinical data are available regarding the co-
administration of Pradaxa and dronedarone, and their co-administration is not recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of a P-gp inducer (such as rifampicin, St. John´s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran concentrations 
and should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Rifampicin: Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 7 days 
decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 and 67 %, respectively. The inducing effect 
was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of 
rifampicin treatment. No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days. 
Other drugs affecting P-gp 
Protease inhibitors including ritonavir and its combinations with other protease inhibitors affect P-gp 
(either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. 
P-gp substrate 
Digoxin: In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when Pradaxa was co-administered with 
digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinical relevant changes on dabigatran exposure have been 
observed. 
Co-medication with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin 
norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups. 
Gastric pH 
Pantoprazole: When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve of approximately 30 % was observed. Pantoprazole and 
other proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and 
concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa. 
Ranitidine: Ranitidine administration together with Pradaxa had no clinically relevant effect on the 
extent of absorption of dabigatran.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Pradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast feeding. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa. 
Fertility 
No human data available. 
In animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations 
and an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure 
level compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence 
on male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5- to 10-fold higher plasma 
exposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an 
increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre- and post-natal study, an 
increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to 
a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
A total of 10,084 patients were treated in 4 actively controlled VTE prevention trials with at least one 
dose of the medicinal product. Of these 5,419 were treated with 150 mg or 220 mg daily of Pradaxa, 
while 389 received doses less than 150 mg daily and 1168 received doses in excess of 220 mg daily. 
In the pivotal study investigating the prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with atrial fibrillation, a 
total of 12,091 patients were randomized to dabigatran etexilate. Of these 6,059 were treated with 
150 mg twice daily of dabigatran etexilate, while 5,983 received doses of 110 mg twice daily. 
In total, about 9 % of patients treated for elective hip or knee surgery (short-term treatment for up to 
42 days) and 22 % of patient with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and SEE 
(long-term treatment for up to 3 years) experienced adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are bleedings occurring in total in approximately 14 % 
of patients treated short-term for elective hip or knee replacement surgery, and 16,5 % in patients with 
atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and SEE. 
Since the patient populations treated in the 2 indications are not comparable and bleeding events are 
distributed over several System Organ Classes (SOC), a summary description of major and any 
bleeding are broken down by indication and given in tables 5 and 6 below. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although low in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of 
location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes. 
Adverse reactions 
Table 4 shows the adverse reactions identified from the primary VTE prevention studies after hip or 
knee replacement surgery and the prevention of thromboembolic stroke and SEE in patients with atrial 
fibrillation program ranked under headings of SOC and frequency using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000, 
< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (can not be estimated from the available data).

follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fatal bleeding 
clinically overt bleeding in excess of what was expected and associated with ≥ 20 g/l 
(corresponds to 1.24 mmol/l) fall in haemoglobin in excess of what was expected

Major bleeding was defined to fulfil one or more of the following criteria: 
Bleeding associated with a reduction in haemoglobin of at least 20 g/l or leading to a transfusion of at 
least 2 units of blood or packed cells. 
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ: intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or intramuscular 
with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra-articular bleeding or pericardial bleeding. 
Major bleeds were classified as life-threatening if they fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: 
Fatal bleed; symptomatic intracranial bleed; reduction in haemoglobin of at least 50 g/l; transfusion of 
at least 4 units of blood or packed cells; a bleed associated with hypotension requiring the use of 
intravenous inotropic agents; a bleed that necessitated surgical intervention. 
Subjects randomized to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily had a 
significantly lower risk for life-threatening bleeds and intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [p 
< 0.05]. Both dose strengths of dabigatran etexilate had also a statistically significant lower total bleed 
rate. Subjects randomized to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily had a significantly lower risk for 
major bleeds compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.80 [p=0.0026]). Subjects randomized to 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily had a significantly higher risk for major GI bleeds compared 
with warfarin (hazard ratio 1.47 [p=0.0008]. This effect was seen primarily in patients ≥ 75 years. 
The clinical benefit of dabigatran with regard to stroke and SEE prevention and decreased risk of ICH 
compared to warfarin is preserved across individual subgroups, e.g. renal impairment, age, 
concomitant medication use such as anti-platelet agents or P-gp inhibitors. While certain patient 
subgroups are at an increased risk of major bleeding when treated with an anticoagulant, the excess 
bleeding risk for dabigatran is due to GI bleeding, typically seen within the first 3-6 months following 
initiation of dabigatran etexilate therapy. 
Myocardial infarction 
In  the  RE-LY  study,  in  comparison  to  warfarin  the  annual  myocardial  infarction  rate  for  dabigatran 
etexilate was increased from 0.64 % (warfarin) to 0.82 % (dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily) / 
0.81 % (dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily) (see section 5.1). 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses of dabigatran etexilate beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of 
bleeding. 
In case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the 
time by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional 
measures e.g. dialysis have been initiated. 
Excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of Pradaxa treatment. There is no specific antidote 
to dabigatran. In the event of haemorrhagic complications, treatment must be discontinued and the 
source of bleeding investigated. Since dabigatran is excreted predominantly by the renal route 
adequate diuresis must be maintained. Appropriate supportive treatment, such as surgical haemostasis 
and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the prescribers discretion. 
Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., FEIBA) or recombinant Factor VIIa or 
concentrates of coagulation factors II, IX and X, may be considered. There is some experimental 
evidence to support the role of these agents in reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data 
on their usefulness in clinical settings and also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is 
very limited. Coagulation tests may become unreliable following adminstration of suggested reversing 
agents. Caution should be exercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given 
to administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting 
antiplatelet drugs have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the 
physician's judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings. 
As protein binding is low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to 
demonstrate the utility of this approach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: direct thrombine inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07. 
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma. 
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran also inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
In-vivo and ex-vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral 
administration in various animal models of thrombosis. 
There is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant 
effect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT. 
The calibrated diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma concentration that 
can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
The ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors. 
The aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation 
intensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable 
for precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran. High aPTT values should be interpreted with caution.  
In general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran 
levels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile 
of dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough is considered to be 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Prevention of VTE 
Steady state (after day 3) geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 
2 hours after 220 mg dabigatran etexilate administration, was 70.8 ng/ml, with a range of 
35.2-162 ng/ml (25th–75th percentile range).The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, 
measured at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 24 hours after a 220 mg dabigatran dose), was on 
average 22.0 ng/ml, with a range of 13.0-35.7 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range). 
In patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery with 220 mg 
dabigatran etexilate once daily, 
 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations was 67 ng/ml, measured at trough 
(20-28 hours after the previous dose) (see section 4.4 and 4.9), 
the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (20-28 hours after the previous dose) was 51 seconds, 
which would be 1.3-fold upper limit of normal. 
 
The ECT was not measured in patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement 
surgery with 220 mg dabigatran etexilate once daily. 
Prevention of stroke and SEE in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with one or more risk 
factors 
Steady state geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 2 hours after 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate administration twice daily, was 175 ng/ml, with a range of 117-275 ng/ml 
(25th-75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, measured at trough 
in the morning, at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran evening 
dose), was on average 91.0 ng/ml, with a range of 61.0-143 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range).For 
patients with atrial nonvalvular fibrillation treated for prevention of stroke and SEE with 150 mg 
dabigatran etexilate twice daily, 
 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after 
the previous dose) was about 200 ng/ml, 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 3-fold upper 
limit of normal refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 103 seconds, 
an aPTT ratio greater than 2-fold upper limit of normal (aPTT prolongation of about 
80 seconds), at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) reflects the 90th percentile of 
observations. 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or 
Chinese patients were observed. 
Clinical trials in Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following major joint replacement 
surgery 
In 2 large randomized, parallel group, double-blind, dose-confirmatory trials, patients undergoing 
elective major orthopaedic surgery (one for knee replacement surgery and one for hip replacement 
surgery) received Pradaxa 75 mg or 110 mg within 1-4 hours of surgery followed by 150 mg or 
220 mg once daily thereafter, haemostasis having been secured, or enoxaparin 40 mg on the day prior 
to surgery and daily thereafter. 
In the RE-MODEL trial (knee replacement) treatment was for 6-10 days and in the RE-NOVATE trial 
(hip replacement) for 28-35 days. Totals of 2,076 patients (knee) and 3,494 (hip) were treated 
respectively. 
Composite of total VTE (including PE, proximal and distal DVT, whatever symptomatic or 
asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and all-cause mortality constituted the primary 
end-point for both studies. Composite of major VTE (including PE and proximal DVT, whatever 
symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and VTE-related mortality constituted 
a secondary end-point and is considered of better clinical relevance. 
Results of both studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of Pradaxa 220 mg and 150 mg were 
statistically non-inferior to that of enoxaparin on total VTE and all-cause mortality. The point estimate 
for incidence of Major VTE and VTE related mortality for the 150 mg dose was slightly worse than 
enoxaparin (table 7). Better results were seen with the 220 mg dose where the point estimate of Major 
VTE was slightly better than enoxaparin (table 7). 
The clinical studies have been conducted in a patient population with a mean age > 65 years. 
There were no differences in the phase 3 clinical studies for efficacy and safety data between men and 
women. 
In the studied patient population of RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE (5,539 patients treated), 51 % 
suffered from concomitant hypertension, 9 % from concomitant diabetes, 9 % from concomitant 
coronary artery disease and 20 % had a history of venous insufficiency. None of these diseases 
showed an impact on the effects of dabigatran on VTE-prevention or bleeding rates. 
Data for the major VTE and VTE-related mortality endpoint were homogeneous with regards to the 
primary efficacy endpoint and are shown in table 7. 
Data for the total VTE and all cause mortality endpoint are shown in table 8. 
Data for adjudicated major bleeding endpoints are shown in table 9 below.

Prevention of stroke and SEE in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with one or more risk 
factors 
The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate is derived from the RE-LY study 
(Randomized Evaluation of Long–term anticoagulant therapy) a multi-centre, multi-national, 
randomized parallel group study of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110 mg and 150 mg 
twice daily) compared to open-label warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk 
of stroke and SEE. The primary objective in this study was to determine if dabigatran etexilate was 
non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint stroke and SEE. 
Statistical superiority was also analyzed. 
In the RE-LY study, a total of 18,113 patients were randomized, with a mean age of 71.5 years and a 
mean CHADS2 score of 2.1. The patient population was 64 % male, 70 % Caucasian and 16 % Asian. 
For patients randomized to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) 
(INR 2-3) was 64.4 % (median TTR 67 %). 
The RE-LY study demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, at a dose of 110 mg twice daily, is 
non-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and SEE in subjects with atrial fibrillation, with a 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduced risk of ICH, total bleeding and major bleeding. The dose of 150 mg twice daily reduces 
significantly the risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, ICH and total bleeding 
compared to warfarin. Major bleeding rates with this dose were comparable to warfarin. Myocardial 
infarction rates were slightly increased with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice 
daily compared to warfarin (hazard ratio 1.29; p=0.0929 and hazard ratio 1.27; p=0.1240, 
respectively). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of dabigatran etexilate 
compared to warfarin diminish.

For the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding there was an interaction of treatment effect and age. 
The relative risk of bleeding with dabigatran compared to warfarin increased with age. Relative risk 
was highest in patients ≥ 75 years. The concomitant use of antiplatelets ASA or clopidogrel 
approximately doubles MBE rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. There was no 
significant interaction of treatment effects with the subgroups of renal function and CHADS2 score.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pradaxa in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of thromboembolic events in the 
granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, 
which is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. 
The absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa was approximately 
6.5 %. 
After oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran 
in plasma is characterized by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 
and 2.0 hours post administration. 
Absorption 
A study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, 
demonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth 
plasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to 
contributing factors such as anaesthesia, gastrointestinal paresis, and surgical effects independent of 
the oral medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed 
absorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran 
is rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration. 
Food does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma 
concentrations by 2 hours. 
The oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % compared to the reference capsule formulation 
when the pellets are taken without the Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, 
the integrity of the HPMC capsules should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally 
increased bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, patients should be advised not to open the 
capsules and taking the pellets alone (e.g. sprinkled over food or into beverages) (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was 
observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60–70 l exceeded the volume of total body 
water indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran. 
Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were dose proportional. Plasma 
concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of 11 hours 
in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was 
observed. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as 
shown in table 15. 
Metabolism and elimination 
Metabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived 
radioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the 
administered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose 
by 168 hours post dose. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four 
positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical 
methods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of 
approximately 100 ml/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate. 
Special populations 
Renal insufficiency 
In phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of Pradaxa is 
approximately 2.7-fold higher in volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL between 
30-50 ml/min) than in those without renal insufficiency. 
In a small number of volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 ml/min), the exposure 
(AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately 2 times longer 
than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).

Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 ml/min dialysate flow rate, 
four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 ml/min or 350-390 ml/min. This resulted in a 
removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of drug cleared by 
dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 ml/min. The anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD relationship 
was not affected by the procedure. 
The median CrCL in RE-LY was 68.4 ml/min. Almost half (45.8 %) of the RE-LY patients had a 
CrCL > 50-< 80 ml/min. Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30-50 ml/min) had 
on average 2.29-fold and 1.81-fold higher pre- and post-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations, 
respectively, when compared with patients without renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 80 ml/min). 
Elderly patients 
Specific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the 
AUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects. 
The effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % 
higher trough concentration for subjects ≥ 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects 
< 65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic insufficiency 
No change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child 
Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Body weight 
The dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in patients with a body weight > 100 kg 
compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ≥ 50 kg and < 100 kg 
category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in patients 
< 50 kg are available. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender 
Active substance exposure in the primary VTE prevention studies was about 40 % to 50 % higher in 
female patients and no dose adjustment is recommended. In atrial fibrillation patients females had on 
average 30 % higher trough and post-dose concentrations. No dose adjustment is required (see section 
4.2). 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
The pro-drug dabigatran etexilate but not dabigatran is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. 
Therefore co-medications with P-gp transporter inhibitors (amiodarone, verapamil, clarithromycin, 
quinidine and ketoconazole) and inducers (rifampicin) had been investigated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.5). 
In vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of 
cytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not 
show any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin 
(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of dabigatran. 
An effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in 
pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were 
toxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body 
weight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the 
pre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the 
dams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
In lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of 
dabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with 
one or more of the following risk factors: 
 
 
 
 
 
Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism (SEE) 
Left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % 
Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 2 
Age ≥ 75 years 
Age ≥ 65 years associated with one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, 
or hypertension 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. Therapy 
should be continued long term. 
For the following two groups the recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg taken as one 110 mg 
capsule twice daily: 
 
 
Patients aged 80 years or above 
Patients who receive concomitant verapamil 
For the following groups, the daily dose of Pradaxa of 300 mg or 220 mg should be selected based on 
an individual assessment of the thromboembolic risk and the risk of bleeding: 
 
 
 
 
Patients between 75-80 years 
Patients with moderate renal impairment 
Patients with gastritis, esophagitis or gastroesophageal reflux 
Other patients at increased risk of bleeding 
See further down and sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of intolerability to dabigatran, patients should be instructed to immediately consult their 
treating physician in order to be switched to alternate acceptable treatment options for prevention of 
stroke and SEE associated with atrial fibrillation. 
Elderly (SPAF) 
Patients between 75-80 years should be treated with a daily dose of 300 mg taken as one 150 mg 
capsule twice daily. A dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily can be individually 
considered, at the discretion of the physician, when the thromboembolic risk is low and the bleeding 
risk is high (see section 4.4). 
Patients aged 80 years or above should be treated with a daily dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg 
capsule twice daily due to the increased risk of bleeding in this population. 
As renal impairment may be frequent in the elderly (>75 years), renal function should be assessed by 
calculating the CrCL prior to initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal 
impairment (i.e. CrCL < 30 ml/min ). The renal function should also be assessed at least once a year in 
patients treated with Pradaxa or more frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is 
suspected that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and 
with certain comedications, etc) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients at risk of bleeding (SPAF) 
Patients with an increased bleeding risk (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2) should be closely 
monitored clinically (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia). Dose adjustment should be decided at 
the discretion of the physician, following assessment of the potential benefit and risk to an individual 
patient. A coagulation test (see section 4.4) may help to identify patients with an increased bleeding 
risk caused by excessive dabigatran exposure. When excessive dabigatran exposure is identified in 
patients at high risk of bleeding, a dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily is 
recommended. When clinically relevant bleeding occurs, treatment should be interrupted. 
For subjects with gastritis, esophagitis, or gastroesophageal reflux, the dose of 220 mg taken as one 
110 mg capsule twice daily may be considered due to the elevated risk of major gastro-intestinal 
bleeding (see section 4.4). 
Assessment of renal function (SPAF): 
In all patients: 
 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with Pradaxa to exclude patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. 
CrCL < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Pradaxa is contraindicated in patients with 
severe renal impairment 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications) 
 
Additional requirements in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and in patients aged over 
75 years: 
 
Renal function should be assessed during treatment with Pradaxa at least once a year or more 
frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal function 
could decline or deteriorate (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications) 
The method used to estimate renal function (CrCL in ml/min) during the clinical development of 
Pradaxa was the Cockgroft-Gault method. The formula is as follows: 
  For creatinine in mol/l: 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.23  (140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female)  
serum creatinine [mmol/l] 
  For creatinine in mg/dl: 
(140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
   72  serum creatinine [mg/dl] 
This method is recommended when assessing patients’ CrCL prior to and during Pradaxa treatment. 
Renal impairment (SPAF) 
Treatment with Pradaxa in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 ml/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCL 50- ≤ 80 ml/min). For 
patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min) the recommended dose of Pradaxa is 
also 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. However, for patients with high risk of 
bleeding, a dose reduction of Pradaxa to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily should be 
considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with 
renal impairment. 
Concomitant use of Pradaxa with strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. amiodarone, quinidine 
or verapamil(SPAF) 
No dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of amiodarone or quinidine (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.2). 
Dosing should be reduced to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily in patients who receive 
concomitantly dabigatran etexilate and verapamil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation Pradaxa 
and verapamil should be taken at the same time. 
Weight (SPAF) 
Given the available clinical and kinetic data, no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2), but 
close clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with a body weight < 50 kg (see section 4.4). 
Gender (SPAF) 
Given the available clinical and kinetic data, no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment (SPAF) 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded in the study 
investigating the prevention of stroke and SEE associated with atrial fibrillation. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not 
recommended in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Switching (SPAF) 
Pradaxa treatment to parenteral anticoagulant 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to Pradaxa 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dabigatran etexilate should be given 0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate 
therapy would be due, or at the time of discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. 
intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see section 4.5). 
Pradaxa treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) 
Adjust the starting time of the VKA based on CrCL as follows: 
 
 
CrCL ≥ 50 ml/min, start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate 
CrCL ≥ 30-< 50 ml/min, start VKA 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate 
Because Pradaxa can contribute to an elevated INR, INR testing should not be performed until 
Pradaxa has been stopped for at least 2 days. 
VKA to Pradaxa 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the International 
Normalized Ratio (INR) is < 2.0. 
Cardioversion (SPAF) 
Patients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. 
Paediatric population (SPAF) 
There is no relevant use of Pradaxa in the paediatric population in the indication: prevention of stroke 
and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 
Pradaxa is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and 
efficacy. 
Missed dose (SPAF) 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. 
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose on, the missed dose should be omitted. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Method of administration (SPAF) 
Pradaxa should be swallowed as a whole with water, with or without food. 
Patients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see 
sections 5.2 and 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications

 
 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 ULN were excluded from the study investigating the 
prevention of stroke and SEE associated with atrial fibrillation. No treatment experience is available 
for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of Pradaxa is not recommended in this 
population. 
Haemorrhagic risk 
As with all anticoagulants, dabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an 
increased risk of bleeding and in situations with concomitant use of drugs affecting haemostasis. 
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with dabigatran. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin 
and/or haematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
Factors, such as decreased renal function (30-50 ml/min CrCL), age ≥ 75 years, low body weight 
< 50 kg, or strong P-gp inhibitor co-medication (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil) are 
associated with increased dabigatran plasma levels (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2). 
In a study of prevention of stroke and SEE in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 
Dabigatran was associated with higher rates of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding which was 
statistically significant for dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily. This increased risk was seen in the 
elderly (≥ 75 years). Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or non steroidal antiinflammatory 
drug (NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux requiring 
proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or histamine 2 (H2)-blocker treatment increase the risk of GI bleeding. In 
these atrial fibrillationpatients a dosage of 220 mg dabigatran given as 110 mg capsule twice daily 
should be considered and posology recommendations in section 4.2 be followed. The administration of 
a PPI can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. 
Bleeding risk may be increased in patients concomitantly treated with selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see section 4.5). 
Close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is recommended throughout the 
treatment period, especially if risk factors are combined (see section 5.1). 
Table 1 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk. Please also refer to 
contraindications in section 4.3.

Bacterial endocarditis 
Esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal 
reflux 
The presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major 
bleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Pradaxa should only be given if the benefit 
outweighs bleeding risks. 
Pradaxa does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring. However, the measurement of 
dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to avoid excessive high exposure to dabigatran in 
the presence of additional risk factors. The INR test is unreliable in patients on Pradaxa and false 
positive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. Diluted 
thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may 
provide useful information, but the tests are not standardized, and results should be interpreted with 
caution (see section 5.1).

Should not be performed 
Patients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue Pradaxa (see section 4.3). 
Limited data is available in patients < 50 kg (see section 5.2). 
When severe bleedings occur treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated 
(see section 4.9). 
Agents that may enhance the risk of haemorrhage should not be administered concomitantly or should 
be administered with caution with Pradaxa (see section 4.5). 
Use of fibrinolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
The use of fibrinolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be considered if the 
patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the ULN according to the local reference 
range. 
Interaction with P-gp inducers 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of P-gp inducers (such as rifampicin, St. John`s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma 
concentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Surgery and interventions 
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Therefore surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
Caution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and 
anticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency 
may take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such 
cases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still 
impaired.

If an acute intervention is required, dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery 
/ intervention should be delayed if possible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot 
be delayed the risk of bleeding may be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the 
urgency of intervention (for cardioversion see section 4.2). 
Spinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture 
Procedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function. 
The risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture 
and by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least 
2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients 
require frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma. 
Post-surgical patients with an increased risk for bleeding 
Patients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with moderate renal 
impairment (CrCL 30-50 ml/min), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Resume 
treatment after complete haemostasis is achieved. 
Patients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events 
There are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran available in these patients and therefore they 
should be treated with caution. 
Myocardial Infarction 
In the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1.) the overall rate of myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.82, 
0.81, and 0.64 % / year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice

daily and warfarin, respectively, an increase in relative risk for dabigatran of 29 % and 27 % compared

subgroups, with similar relative risk: patients with previous MI, patients ≥ 65 years with either 
diabetes or coronary artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, and patients 
with moderate renal dysfunction. Furthermore a higher risk of MI was seen in patients concomitantly 
taking ASA plus clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone.

Pradaxa hard capsules contain the colorant sunset yellow (E110), which may cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents 
The following treatments have not been studied and may increase the risk of bleeding when used 
concomitantly with Pradaxa: UFH, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives 
(fondaparinux, desirudin), thrombolytic agents, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, 
ticagrelor, dextran, sulfinpyrazone, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonists (see section 4.4). 
UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Only limited data on concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate and other anticoagulants are available, 
and no firm conclusions can be drawn. From the limited data collected in the phase III study RE-LY in 
patients with atrial fibrillation it was observed that the concomitant use of other oral or parenteral 
anticoagulants increases major bleeding rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin by 
approximately 2.5-fold, mainly related to situations when switching from one anticoagulant to another 
(see section 4.3). 
From the data collected in the phase III study RE-LY in patients with atrial fibrillation (see section 
5.1), it was observed that the concomitant use of antiplatelets ASA or clopidogrel approximately 
doubles major bleeding rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin (see section 4.4). 
Clopidogrel: In a phase I study in young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of 
dabigatran etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times 
compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss and the 
coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation as measure of 
clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective 
mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40 % (see section 4.4) (see also subsection on ASA below). 
ASA: The effect of concomitant administration of dabigatran etexilate and ASA on the risk of bleeds 
was studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in a phase II study in which a randomized ASA 
co-administration was applied. Based on logistic regression analysis, co-administration of ASA and 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 
24 % with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4). 
NSAIDs: NSAIDs given for short-term perioperative analgesia have been shown not to be associated 
with increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With chronic use in 
the RE-LY study, NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by approximately 50% on both dabigatran 
etexilate and warfarin. Therefore, due to the risk of haemorrhage, notably with NSAIDs with 
elimination half-lives > 12 hours, close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended (see section 
4.4). 
LMWH: The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not been 
specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily 40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after 
administration of dabigatran etexilate (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity 
was observed after dabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that 
after treatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over effect of 
enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-coagulation 
tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin. 
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile 
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran. 
Transporter interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of 
strong P-gp inhibitors (such as amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine, ketoconazole and clarithromycin) is 
expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
If not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or 
anaemia) 
is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. A coagulation test helps to 
identify patients with an increased bleeding risk due to increased dabigatran exposure (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole and tacrolimus are contraindicated (see section 
4.3). Caution should be exercised with other strong P-gp inhibitors (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine or 
verapamil) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values by 138 % and 135 %, 
respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and 153 % and 149 %, respectively, after multiple oral 
dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once daily. The time to peak, terminal half-life and mean residence 
time were not affected by ketoconazole (see section 4.4). Concomitant treatment with systemic 
ketoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Amiodarone: When Pradaxa was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg amiodarone, the 
extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active metabolite DEA were essentially 
unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were increased by about 60 % and 50 %, respectively. The 
mechanism of the interaction has not been completely clarified. In view of the long half-life of 
amiodarone the potential for drug interaction may exist for weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4 Close clinical surveillance is recommended when dabigatran etexilate is 
combined with amiodarone and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a 
mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Quinidine: Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1000 mg. 
Dabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day either with or 
without quinidine. Dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on average by 53 % and 56 %, 
respectively with concomitant quinidine (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Close clinical surveillance is 
recommended when dabigatran etexilate is combined with quinidine and particularly in the occurrence 
of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Verapamil: When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the Cmax and 
AUC of dabigatran were increased but magnitude of this change differs depending on timing of 
administration and formulation of verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an immediate release 
formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax 
by about 180 % and AUC by about 150 %). The effect was progressively decreased with 
administration of an extended release formulation (increased of Cmax by about 90 % and AUC by about 
70 %) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increased of Cmax by about 60 % and AUC by 
about 50 %).  
Patients concomitantly receiving dabigatran etexilate and verapamil, the dose of Pradaxa should be 
reduced to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily (see section 4.2). Close clinical 
surveillance is recommended when dabigatran etexilate is combined with verapamil and particularly in 
the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
There was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours after dabigatran 
etexilate (increased of Cmax by about 10 % and AUC by about 20 %). This is explained by completed 
dabigatran absorption after 2 hours (see section 4.4). 
Clarithromycin: When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with dabigatran 
etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 19 % and Cmax by about 15 % was observed 
without any clinical safety concern. However, in patients receiving dabigatran, a clinically relevant 
interaction cannot be excluded when combined with clarithromycin. Therefore, a close monitoring 
should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is combined with clarithromycin and particularly in the 
occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment. 
The following potent P-gp inhibitors have not been clinically studied but from in vitro results a similar 
effect as with ketoconazole may be expected: 
Itraconazole, tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which are contra-indicated (see section 4.3). 
Neither clinical nor in vitro test results are available for posaconazole which is not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. Inadequate clinical data are available regarding the co-
administration of Pradaxa and dronedarone, and their co-administration is not recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of a P-gp inducer (such as rifampicin, St. John´s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran concentrations 
and should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Rifampicin: Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 7 days 
decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 and 67 %, respectively. The inducing effect 
was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of 
rifampicin treatment. No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days. 
Other drugs affecting P-gp 
Protease inhibitors including ritonavir and its combinations with other protease inhibitors affect P-gp 
(either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. 
P-gp substrate 
Digoxin: In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when Pradaxa was co-administered with 
digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinical relevant changes on dabigatran exposure have been 
observed. 
Co-medication with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin 
norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups. 
Gastric pH 
Pantoprazole: When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve of approximately 30 % was observed. Pantoprazole and 
other proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and 
concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa. 
Ranitidine: Ranitidine administration together with Pradaxa had no clinically relevant effect on the 
extent of absorption of dabigatran. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Pradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast feeding. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa. 
Fertility 
No human data available. 
In animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations 
and an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure 
level compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence 
on male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5- to 10-fold higher plasma 
exposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an 
increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre- and post-natal study, an 
increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to 
a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
In the pivotal study investigating the prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with atrial fibrillation, a 
total of 12,091 patients were randomized. Of these 6,059 were treated with 150 mg twice daily of 
dabigatran etexilate, while 5,983 received doses of 110 mg twice daily. 
In total, 22 % of patient with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and SEE (long-term 
treatment for up to 3 years) experienced adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are bleedings occurring in total in approximately 
16,5 % in patients with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and SEE. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although low in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of 
location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.

Major bleeding was defined to fulfil one or more of the following criteria: 
Bleeding associated with a reduction in haemoglobin of at least 20 g/l or leading to a transfusion of at 
least 2 units of blood or packed cells. 
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ: intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or intramuscular 
with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra-articular bleeding or pericardial bleeding. 
Major bleeds were classified as life-threatening if they fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: 
Fatal bleed; symptomatic intracranial bleed; reduction in haemoglobin of at least 50 g/l; transfusion of 
at least 4 units of blood or packed cells; a bleed associated with hypotension requiring the use of 
intravenous inotropic agents; a bleed that necessitated surgical intervention. 
Subjects randomized to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily had a 
significantly lower risk for life-threatening bleeds and intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [p 
< 0.05]. Both dose strengths of dabigatran etexilate had also a statistically significant lower total bleed 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rate. Subjects randomized to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily had a significantly lower risk for 
major bleeds compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.80 [p=0.0026]). Subjects randomized to 
dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily had a significantly higher risk for major GI bleeds compared 
with warfarin (hazard ratio 1.47 [p=0.0008]. This effect was seen primarily in patients ≥ 75 years. 
The clinical benefit of dabigatran with regard to stroke and SEE prevention and decreased risk of ICH 
compared to warfarin is preserved across individual subgroups, e.g. renal impairment, age, 
concomitant medication use such as anti-platelet agents or P-gp inhibitors. While certain patient 
subgroups are at an increased risk of major bleeding when treated with an anticoagulant, the excess 
bleeding risk for dabigatran is due to GI bleeding, typically seen within the first 3-6 months following 
initiation of dabigatran etexilate therapy. 
Myocardial infarction 
In the RE-LY study, in comparison to warfarin the annual myocardial infarction rate for dabigatran 
etexilate was increased from 0.64 % (warfarin) to 0.82 % (dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily) / 
0.81 % (dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily) (see section 5.1). 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses of dabigatran etexilate beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of 
bleeding. 
In case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative (dTT) test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of 
the time by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional 
measures e.g. dialysis have been initiated. 
Excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of Pradaxa treatment. There is no specific antidote 
to dabigatran. In the event of haemorrhagic complications, treatment must be discontinued and the 
source of bleeding investigated. Since dabigatran is excreted predominantly by the renal route 
adequate diuresis must be maintained. Appropriate supportive treatment, such as surgical haemostasis 
and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the prescribers discretion. 
Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., FEIBA) or recombinant Factor VIIa or 
concentrates of coagulation factors II, IX and X, may be considered. There is some experimental 
evidence to support the role of these agents in reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data 
on their usefulness in clinical settings and also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is 
very limited. Coagulation tests may become unreliable following adminstration of suggested reversing 
agents. Caution should be exercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given 
to administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting 
antiplatelet drugs have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the 
physician's judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings. 
As protein binding is low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to 
demonstrate the utility of this approach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: direct thrombine inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma. 
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran also inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
In-vivo and ex-vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral 
administration in various animal models of thrombosis. 
There is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant 
effect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT. 
The calibrated diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma concentration that 
can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
The ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors. 
The aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation 
intensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable 
for precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran. High aPTT values should be interpreted with caution.  
In general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran 
levels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile 
of dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough is considered to be 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Steady state geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 2 hours after 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate administration twice daily, was 175 ng/ml, with a range of 117-275 ng/ml 
(25th–75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, measured at trough 
in the morning, at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran evening 
dose), was on average 91.0 ng/ml, with a range of 61.0-143 ng/ml (25th–75th percentile range). 
For patients with atrial nonvalvular fibrillation treated for prevention of stroke and SEE with 150 mg 
dabigatran etexilate twice daily, 
 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after 
the previous dose) was about 200 ng/ml, 
an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 3-fold upper 
limit of normal refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 103 seconds, 
an aPTT ratio greater than 2-fold upper limit of normal (aPTT prolongation of about 
80 seconds), at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) reflects the 90th percentile of 
observations. 
 
 
The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate is derived from the RE-LY study 
(Randomized Evaluation of Long –term anticoagulant therapy) a multi-centre, multi-national, 
randomized parallel group study of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110 mg and 150 mg 
twice daily) compared to open-label warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk 
of stroke and SEE. The primary objective in this study was to determine if dabigatran etexilate was 
non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint stroke and SEE. 
Statistical superiority was also analyzed. 
In the RE-LY study, a total of 18,113 patients were randomized, with a mean age of 71.5 years and a 
mean CHADS2 score of 2.1. The patient population was 64 % male, 70 % Caucasian and 16 % Asian. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients randomized to warfarin, the mean percentage within time in therapeutic range (TTR) 
(INR 2-3) was 64.4 % (median TTR 67 %). 
The RE-LY study demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, at a dose of 110 mg twice daily, is 
non-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and SEE in subjects with atrial fibrillation, with a 
reduced risk of ICH, total bleeding and major bleeding. The dose of 150 mg twice daily, reduces 
significantly the risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, ICH and total bleeding 
compared to warfarin. Major bleeding rates with this dose were comparable to warfarin. Myocardial 
infarction rates were slightly increased with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice 
daily compared to warfarin (hazard ratio 1.29; p=0.0929 and hazard ratio 1.27; p=0.1240, 
respectively). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of dabigatran etexilate 
compared to warfarin diminish.

For the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding there was an interaction of treatment effect and age. 
The relative risk of bleeding with dabigatran compared to warfarin increased with age. Relative risk 
was highest in patients ≥ 75 years. The concomitant use of antiplatelets ASA or clopidogrel 
approximately doubles MBE rates with both dabigatran and warfarin. There was no significant 
interaction of treatment effects with the subgroups of renal function and CHADS2 score.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pradaxa in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of thromboembolic events in the 
granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or 
Chinese patients were observed. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, 
which is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. 
The absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa was approximately 
6.5 %. 
After oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran 
in plasma is characterized by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 
and 2.0 hours post administration. 
Absorption 
A study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, 
demonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth 
plasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to 
contributing factors such as anaesthesia, GI paresis, and surgical effects independent of the oral 
medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed 
absorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran 
is rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration. 
Food does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma 
concentrations by 2 hours. 
The oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % compared to the reference capsule formulation 
when the pellets are taken without the Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, 
the integrity of the HPMC capsules should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally 
increased bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, patients should be advised not to open the 
capsules and taking the pellets alone (e.g. sprinkled over food or into beverages) (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was 
observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60-70 l exceeded the volume of total body water 
indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran. 
Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were dose proportional. Plasma 
concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of 11 hours 
in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was 
observed. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as 
shown in table 11. 
Metabolism and elimination 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived 
radioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the 
administered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose 
by 168 hours post dose. 
Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four 
positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical 
methods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of 
approximately 100 ml/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate. 
Special populations 
Renal insufficiency 
In phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of Pradaxa is 
approximately 2.7-fold higher in volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL between 30–
50 ml/min) than in those without renal insufficiency. 
In a small number of volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 ml/min), the exposure 
(AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately 2 times longer 
than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).

27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0) 
Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 ml/min dialysate flow rate, 
four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 ml/min or 350-390 ml/min. This resulted in a 
removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of drug cleared by 
dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 ml/min. The anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD relationship 
was not affected by the procedure. 
The median CrCL in RE-LY was 68.4 ml/min. Almost half (45.8 %) of the RE-LY patients had a 
CrCL > 50-< 80 ml/min. Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30 and 50 ml/min) 
had on average 2.29-fold and 1.81-fold higher pre- and post-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations, 
respectively, when compared with patients without renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 80 ml/min). 
Elderly patients 
Specific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the 
AUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects. 
The effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % 
higher trough concentration for subjects ≥ 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects 
< 65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic insufficiency 
No change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child 
Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Body weight 
The dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in patients with a body weight > 100 kg 
compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ≥ 50 kg and < 100 kg 
category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in patients 
< 50 kg are available. 
Gender 
In atrial fibrillation patients females had on average 30 % higher trough and post-dose concentrations. 
No dose adjustment is recommended (see section 4.2). 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
The pro-drug dabigatran etexilate but not dabigatran is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. 
Therefore co-medications with P-gp transporter inhibitors (amiodarone, verapamil, clarithromycin, 
quinidine and ketoconazole) and inducers (rifampicin) had been investigated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.5). 
In vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of 
cytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not 
show any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin 
(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of dabigatran. 
An effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in 
pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were 
toxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body 
weight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the 
pre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the 
dams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
In lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of 
dabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.

What is Pradaxa 
Pradaxa is a medicine which contains the active substance dabigatran etexilate. It works by blocking a 
substance in the body which is involved in blood clot formation. 
What Pradaxa is used for 
Pradaxa is used to prevent the formation of blood clots in the veins after knee or hip replacement 
surgery.

Do not take Pradaxa 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to dabigatran etexilate, dabigatran or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you have severely reduced kidney function. 
if you are currently bleeding. 
if you have a disease in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding. 
if you have an increased tendency to bleed. This may be inborn, of unknown cause or due to 
other medicines. 
if you have a severely reduced liver function or liver disease which could possibly cause death. 
if you are taking oral ketoconazole or itraconazole, medicines to treat fungal infections. 
if you are taking cyclosporine or tacrolimus, medicines to prevent organ rejection after

Warnings and precautions 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor before taking Pradaxa. You may also need to talk to your doctor during treatment 
with Pradaxa if you experience symptoms or if you have to undergo surgery. Tell your doctor if you 
have or have had any medical conditions or illnesses, in particular any of those included in the 
following list: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have a liver disease that is associated with changes in the blood tests, the use of Pradaxa 
is not recommended. 
if you have an increased bleeding risk, as could be the case in the following situations: 
 if you have been recently bleeding. 
 if you have had a surgical tissue removal (biopsy) in the past month. 
 if you have had a serious injury (e.g. a bone fracture, head injury or any injury requiring 
surgical treatment). 
 if you are suffering from an inflammation of the gullet or stomach. 
 if you have problems with reflux of gastric juice into the gullet. 
 if you are receiving medicines which could increase the risk of bleeding. 
 if you are taking anti-inflammatory medicines. 
 if you are suffering from an infection of the heart (bacterial endocarditis). 
 if you know you have impaired kidney function, or you are suffering from dehydration 
(symptoms include feeling thirsty and passing reduced amounts of dark-coloured (concentrated) 
urine). 
 if you are older than 75 years. 
 if you weigh 50 kg or less. 
if you have had or if you are at risk to develop a heart attack. 
if you undergo a planned surgery. Pradaxa will need to be stopped temporarily due to an 
increased bleeding risk during and shortly after an operation. If possible, Pradaxa should be 
stopped at least 24 hours before an operation. In patients with a higher risk for bleeding your 
doctor may decide to stop treatment earlier. 
if you need to undergo an unplanned surgery. If possible, a surgery should be delayed until at 
least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed, there may be an increased risk of 
bleeding. Your doctor will consider this risk of bleeding together with the urgency of the 
surgery. 
if you have a tube (catheters) inserted into the back: 
A tube can be inserted into your back e.g. for anaesthesia or pain relief during or after surgery. 
If you are administered Pradaxa after removal of a catheter, your doctor will examine you 
regularly. 
if you fall or injure yourself during treatment, especially if you hit your head, please seek urgent 
medical attention. You may need to be checked by a doctor, as you may be at increased risk of 
bleeding. 
Children and adolescents 
Pradaxa should not be used in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Pradaxa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. For instance: 
- 
- 
Medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, phenprocoumon, heparin, clopidogrel, 
prasugrel, ticagrelor, rivaroxaban) 
Anti-inflammatory and pain reliever medicines (e.g. aspirine)

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Pradaxa. You may also need to talk to your doctor during treatment 
with Pradaxa if you experience symptoms or if you have to undergo surgery. Tell your doctor if you 
have or have had any medical conditions or illnesses, in particular any of those included in the 
following list: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have a liver disease that is associated with changes in the blood tests, the use of Pradaxa 
is not recommended. 
if you have an increased bleeding risk, as could be the case in the following situations: 
 if you have been recently bleeding. 
 if you have had a surgical tissue removal (biopsy) in the past month. 
 if you have had a serious injury (e.g. a bone fracture, head injury or any injury requiring 
surgical treatment). 
 if you are suffering from an inflammation of the gullet or stomach. 
 if you have problems with reflux of gastric juice into the gullet. 
 if you are receiving medicines which could increase the risk of bleeding. 
 if you are taking anti-inflammatory medicines. 
 if you are suffering from an infection of the heart (bacterial endocarditis). 
 if you know you have impaired kidney function, or you are suffering from dehydration 
(symptoms include feeling thirsty and passing reduced amounts of dark-coloured (concentrated) 
urine). 
 if you are older than 75 years. 
 if you weigh 50 kg or less. 
if you have had or if you are at risk to develop a heart attack. 
if you undergo a planned surgery. Pradaxa will need to be stopped temporarily due to an 
increased bleeding risk during and shortly after an operation. If possible, Pradaxa should be 
stopped at least 24 hours before an operation. In patients with a higher risk for bleeding your 
doctor may decide to stop treatment earlier. 
if you need to undergo an unplanned surgery. If possible, a surgery should be delayed until at 
least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed, there may be an increased risk of 
bleeding. Your doctor will consider this risk of bleeding together with the urgency of the 
surgery. 
if you have a tube (catheters) inserted into the back: 
A tube can be inserted into your back e.g. for anaesthesia or pain relief during or after surgery. 
If you are administered Pradaxa after removal of a catheter, your doctor will examine you 
regularly. 
if you fall or injure yourself during treatment, especially if you hit your head, please seek urgent 
medical attention. You may need to be checked by a doctor, as you may be at increased risk of 
bleeding. 
Children and adolescents 
Pradaxa should not be used in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Pradaxa

Warnings and precautions 
120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor before taking Pradaxa. You may also need to talk to your doctor during treatment 
with Pradaxa if you experience symptoms or if you have to undergo surgery.Tell your doctor if you 
have or have had any medical conditions or illnesses, in particular any of those included in the 
following list: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have a liver disease that is associated with changes in the blood tests, the use of Pradaxa 
is not recommended. 
if you have an increased bleeding risk, as could be the case in the following situations: 
 if you have been recently bleeding. 
 if you have had a surgical tissue removal (biopsy) in the past month. 
 if you have had a serious injury (e.g. a bone fracture, head injury or any injury requiring 
surgical treatment). 
 if you are suffering from an inflammation of the gullet or stomach. 
 if you have problems with reflux of gastric juice into the gullet. 
 if you are receiving medicines which could increase the risk of bleeding. 
 if you are taking anti-inflammatory medicines. 
 if you are suffering from an infection of the heart (bacterial endocarditis). 
 if you know you have impaired kidney function, or you are suffering from dehydration 
(symptoms include feeling thirsty and passing reduced amounts of dark-coloured (concentrated) 
urine). 
 if you are older than 75 years. 
 if you weigh 50 kg or less. 
if you have had or if you are at risk to develop a heart attack. 
if you undergo a planned surgery. Pradaxa will need to be stopped temporarily due to an 
increased bleeding risk during and shortly after an operation. If possible, Pradaxa should be 
stopped at least 24 hours before an operation. In patients with a higher risk for bleeding your 
doctor may decide to stop treatment earlier. 
if you need to undergo an unplanned surgery. If possible, a surgery should be delayed until at 
least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed, there may be an increased risk of 
bleeding. Your doctor will consider this risk of bleeding together with the urgency of the 
surgery. 
if you have a tube (catheters) inserted into the back: 
A tube can be inserted into your back e.g. for anaesthesia or pain relief during or after surgery. 
If you are administered Pradaxa after removal of a catheter, your doctor will examine you 
regularly. 
if you fall or injure yourself during treatment, especially if you hit your head, please seek urgent 
medical attention. You may need to be checked by a doctor, as you may be at increased risk of 
bleeding. 
Children and adolescents 
Pradaxa should not be used in children and adolescents.

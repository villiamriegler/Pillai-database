Opinion 
27 Jun 2019 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Dapagliflozin is approved in the 
European Union (EU) since November 2012 (FORXIGA: EMEA/H/C/002322; EDISTRIDE: 
EMEA/H/C/004161). Dapagliflozin can be given as monotherapy or in combination with other medicinal 
products indicated for the treatment of T2DM. 
XIGDUO/EBYMECT (dapagliflozin/metformin immediate release) combines dapagliflozin and metformin in 
a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet designed to be administered twice daily. The XIGDUO FDC was first 
approved for the treatment of T2DM in the EU on 16 January 2014 and the EBYMECT FDC was approved 
on 16 November 2015. 
This application is based on the recently completed Phase IIIb study D1693C00001/DECLARE-TIMI 58 
(hereafter referred to as ‘DECLARE’). DECLARE evaluated the effect of dapagliflozin compared to placebo 
on cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes in a broad T2DM population with or without established CV 
disease. DECLARE was a Category 3 post-authorisation safety study (PASS) in the EU (PAM 005) and was 
designed to address post-marketing requirements in the US. 
In the EU, the PASS requirement was that DECLARE be designed to evaluate bladder cancer. Other 
potential safety concerns that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested be assessed were clinical 
consequences of increased haematocrit, renal impairment/failure, bone fracture, liver injury, breast 
cancer, prostate cancer, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), amputations, and pancreatitis. Some of these 
requests were made while the study was ongoing. 
In addition to addressing these safety concerns, the MAH also seeks to modify the current indication for 
improvement of glycaemic control to also allow for the use of FORXIGA/EDISTRIDE/XIGDUO/EBYMECT in 
adults with T2DM:  
 
 
for the prevention of new or worsening HF or CV death 
for the prevention of new or worsening nephropathy. 
Updates are proposed to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Risk Management Plan 
(RMP) based on the assessment of DECLARE data. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.

Figure 1 Study design 
Study participants 
No substantive alterations of eligibility criteria were made after start of patient recruitment. Following a 
CSP amendment, the proportion of patients with an HbA1c between 6.5% and <7.0% was capped at 
approximately 5%. 
Key inclusion criteria 
For inclusion in the study, patients had to fulfil the following criteria: 
Female or male aged ≥40 years, diagnosed with T2DM with a high risk for CV event defined as having 
either established CV disease and/or multiple risk factors. Patients with no known CV disease should have 
at least 2 CV risk factors in addition to T2DM, defined as: Age (>55 years in men and >60 in women) and 
the presence of at least 1 of the following additional risk factors – dyslipidaemia, hypertension or current 
tobacco use. 
Key exclusion criteria 
Exclusion criteria were applied to limit bias and ensure patient safety. Key exclusion criteria included: 
  Recent acute CV event, or systolic BP >180 or diastolic BP >100 mmHg 
  History of bladder cancer, history of other malignancy within 5 years 
  Haematuria with no explanation as judged by the investigator 
  HbA1c ≥12% or HbA1c <6.5% from the central laboratory 
  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min (based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation) 
Exclusion criteria for CV history and hypertension were included to limit data skewing due to a large 
contribution of primary endpoint events from a high-risk patient subpopulation. Criteria relating to 
bladder cancer were included to ensure robust and unbiased evaluation of bladder cancer safety 
information. Patients considered unlikely to be compliant or unlikely to complete the study were also 
excluded.

Treatments 
During the placebo run-in period, the treatment regimen for all patients was: 
 
Placebo administered orally once daily for 4 to 8 weeks 
During the double-blind treatment period, the doses and treatment regimens were: 
  Dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets, administered orally once daily until the end of the study (predicted 
median duration of treatment period 4.5 years) 
  Matching placebo for dapagliflozin 10 mg administered orally once daily until the end of the study 
(predicted median duration of treatment period 4.5 years) 
The study drug was to be taken once daily in the morning and at approximately the same time of the day 
during the study period. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to determine the effect of dapagliflozin relative to placebo on CV outcomes 
when added to current background therapy in patients with T2DM with either established CV disease or at 
least 2 CV risk factors. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objective was to determine whether treatment with dapagliflozin compared with placebo 
when added to current background therapy in patients with T2DM with either established CV disease or at 
least 2 CV risk factors in addition to T2DM will result in a reduction of renal events or all-cause mortality. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable: 
The co-primary outcome variables of the study are the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke (time to first event) and the composite endpoint of 
hospitalization for heart failure or CV death (time to first event). All components of these composites will 
be adjudicated. 
Primary safety variable: 
The primary safety variable is the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or ischemic stroke 
(time to first event). 
Secondary efficacy variables: 
  Renal composite endpoint: Confirmed sustained ≥40% decrease in eGFR to eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.73m2 (using CKD-EPI equation) and/or ESRD (dialysis ≥90 days or kidney 
transplantation, confirmed sustained eGFR <15ml/min/1.73m2) and/or renal or CV death (time to 
first event)

Sample size 
The sample size was primarily determined based on the MACE superiority objective; 1390 primary events 
were required to have 85% power to demonstrate superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo if the true HR 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 11/89
 
  
  
 
 
was 0.85, i.e., a 15% relative risk reduction using a one-sided alpha of 2.31%. To achieve this number of 
primary events, 17150 randomised patients were required for the study assuming 33% was to be from a 
primary prevention population and 67% from a secondary prevention population with assumed annual 
event rates of 1.0% and 2.6% respectively on placebo, and an annual withdrawal rate of 1.0% over a 3-
year accrual period and 3-year minimum follow-up.  
With study protocol amendment 3 (28 April 2014), the enrolment target was increased from 
approximately 22,000 to 27,000 to ensure a sufficient number of randomised patients as the screen 
failure rate was higher than expected (estimated to 35% instead of 22%). 
With amendment 3, the aim also became to continue recruitment allowing patients to be included with no 
exact proportions defined regarding primary and secondary prevention. As of 28 April 2014, 9285 
patients had been randomised and the proportion of patients randomised from the primary and secondary 
populations were approximately 60% (instead of 33%) and 40% (instead of 67%), respectively.   
The assumptions initially made were changed to read; an assumed annual event rate of 2.1% on placebo. 
With these assumptions and 1390 MACE events collected, the study was estimated to have >99% power 
to test the hypothesis of non-inferiority of dapagliflozin to placebo (H0:HR [dapa:placebo] ≥1.3 vs. 
H1:HR <1.3).    
Initially, the study had a single primary endpoint (MACE). With study protocol amendment 5 (25 
September 2016), a composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF and CV death was added as an 
additional primary efficacy variable. Using the above sample size and assumptions for study withdrawal 
and follow-up, approximately 770 events were expected of the composite of CV death and hospitalisation 
for HF; collection of 770 events would provide 87% power to detect a HR of 0.80 with a 1-sided α of 
2.31%. 
Randomisation 
To help identify non-adherent patients, the study included a 4 to 8-week placebo run-in period (+ 14 
days) starting at Visit 1. Randomisation was performed via an IVRS/IWRS at Visit 2 in balanced blocks to 
ensure approximate balance between the two treatment arms (1:1). 
Randomisation was stratified by CV risk category (established CV disease; multiple risk factors without 
established CV disease) and baseline haematuria status. Enrolment of patients based on disease state, 
geographic region, and gender were to be monitored and could be capped to ensure adequate 
representation; recruitment was e.g. to be monitored to randomise approximately 30% of patients each 
from North America and Europe. 
With amendment 2 (19 December 2013), the proportion of patients with HbA1c >6.5% to <7.0% was to 
be capped at 5% to allow for a broad representation of patients with different levels of glycaemic control.  
With study protocol amendment 3 (28 April 2014) it was implemented that the proportions of patients 
with established CV disease vs. CV risk factors were to be monitored both overall and by region. This was 
to ensure that at least approximately 33% of randomised patients overall had established CV disease, 
and to avoid large differences between regions. The overall proportions of patients with established CV 
disease vs. CV risk factors were not to be precisely defined but based on randomisation so far it was 
expected that approximately 33% would have established CV disease.

Blinding (masking) 
The run-in was performed single-blind and the randomised treatment period was performed double-blind. 
Masking of treatments was to be achieved using matching placebo; the active tablets and the respective 
placebo tablets were to be identical in size, colour, smell, and taste. The bottles with investigational 
products were labelled with unique identification numbers allocated from the IVRS/IWRS. 
The primary and secondary CV efficacy variables were adjudicated by a blinded independent Clinical 
Event Adjudication Committee (CEC). The purpose of the CEC was to adjudicate reported and suspected 
CV endpoint events and selected safety events in a consistent and unbiased manner.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) regularly monitored the progress of the study and was 
responsible for safeguarding the interests of the patients in the study, reviewing the safety of the study 
drug and the overall conduct of the study, and for determining whether stopping criteria were met during 
the interim analyses. The DMC were to be provided with fully or partially unblinded data at regular 
intervals to fulfil their review commitment as specified in the DMC charter.  
Statistical methods 
Study D1693C00001 (DECLARE) had a group sequential design with two interim analyses. The appointed 
DMC was responsible for assessing the data at the two interim analyses, occurring when 1/3 and 2/3 of 
the primary events had accumulated, and make recommendations based upon stopping guidelines. Using 
O-Brian Fleming boundaries, a one-sided alpha of 2.31% was used for the final analysis. 
The primary efficacy variables were the time to first event included in the composite endpoint of CV 
death, MI or ischemic stroke and the time to first event included in the composite of hospitalization for 
heart failure and CV death. The composite endpoint of HF hospitalisation and CV death was added as an 
additional primary efficacy variable while the study was ongoing (amendment 5, see Study conduct).  
Description of analysis sets 
Full analysis set 
The FAS included all randomised patients, irrespective of protocol adherence and continued participation 
in the study. Patients were analysed according to their randomised study drug assignment, irrespective of 
whether an event occurred before or after discontinuation of study drug. Patients who withdrew consent 
or were lost to follow-up for vital status were included up to the date of their study termination, except 
for vital status known through public records (for use in analysis of all-cause mortality). 
The FAS was considered the primary analysis set for the primary and secondary variables and for the 
exploratory efficacy variables.  
On-treatment full analysis set 
The OT-FAS included all randomised patients irrespective of protocol adherence, and only observations 
collected during treatment with study drug or within a certain number of days of the last dose of study 
drug: 
 
 
Primary and secondary variables: within 30 days of last dose of study drug 
eGFR (as exploratory efficacy variable): within 7 days of last dose of study drug 
As for the FAS for the full study period, patients were analysed according to their randomised study drug 
assignment. The on-treatment safety analysis set (OT-SAS) was used for sensitivity analyses of the 
efficacy variables.

EMA/476671/2019 
Page 13/89
 
  
  
 
 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints 
All analyses were stratified according to baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease category and the 
presence or absence of haematuria at baseline. Stratification of analyses were performed using the 
stratification values as entered in IVRS to determine the randomisation assignment. 
Censoring 
The end of study was defined as the time of the last visit or study contact (where a clinical event 
assessment was performed) for each individual patient. If no event occurred for an endpoint or a patient 
withdrew consent, the last clinical event assessment or death (whichever was earliest) was treated as the 
censoring event. If none of these were available, date of last documented contact (ie, last visit) was be 
used for censoring. For all-cause mortality and CV death, censoring occurred at the Closing Visit for 
patients known to be alive, or otherwise at the date last known to be alive. If none of these were 
available, the date of last documented contact (ie, last visit) was used for censoring. For analysis of CV 
death, a patient who died of a non-CV cause (or undetermined cause) was censored at the time of death. 
Deaths occurring after the date of withdrawal of consent (and for patients lost to follow-up) and 
documented in publicly available source data was recorded in the eCRF, adjudicated if possible, and 
included in the analyses of deaths. 
The primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), using events adjudicated and 
confirmed to meet endpoint definitions by the Clinical Event Adjudication Committee (CEC). The analysis 
was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a factor for treatment group stratified by 
cardiovascular risk category (established cardiovascular disease, or multiple risk factors without 
established cardiovascular disease), and baseline haematuria. Hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, 
and P values for time-to event analyses were reported for the primary outcomes and event rates by 1000 
patient years presented. 
The contribution of each component of the primary composite endpoints to the overall treatment effect 
were examined using methods similar to those described for the primary analysis.  
HRs and CIs for overall analysis and subgroups were presented with forest plots. Kaplan-Meier estimates 
of the cumulative incidence to the first occurrence of any event in the primary endpoints were calculated 
and plotted, for the overall analysis and for the individual components. Kaplan-Meier plots, overall and by 
CV risk category were presented, by treatment, for the primary analyses as well as for the individual 
components. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the same methods as above on the on-treatment analysis set. 
The analysis of secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy time-to-event variables were analysed in a similar manner to the primary variable. 
For the secondary variable components of time to decrease of ≥ 40% to eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 and 
eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, the observation needed to be confirmed by 2 central laboratory 
measurements separated by at least 4 weeks. Time to onset was the first of the 2 subsequent laboratory 
assessments. If the observation could not be confirmed, the observation was excluded from the main 
analysis. 
Confirmatory testing procedure 
A closed test procedure was used to control for overall Type I error rate across the analyses of the 
primary efficacy and secondary endpoints. The primary objective was evaluated in two steps where the 
Assessment report

first step aimed to determine if dapagliflozin was non-inferior to placebo for the primary composite 
endpoint of CV death, MI or ischemic stroke. If non-inferiority was shown the second step aimed to show 
if dapagliflozin was superior to placebo on both primary endpoints: the alpha was split and testing was 
performed in parallel for superiority for MACE and for superiority for hospitalization for heart failure/CV 
death. Recycling of alpha was to be used, and if both superiority for MACE and superiority for 
hospitalization for heart failure/CV death had been reached, then testing was to proceed with full alpha 
further down the hierarchy. (Burman et al 2009). 
Confirmatory testing procedures using 1-sided α 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the primary analysis included analyses: 
  Using the on-treatment full analysis set (OT-FAS) 
  With censoring at a fixed calendar date (the date that the executive committee instructed the 
sites to commence study close-out) 
  By time interval 
  Of recurrent events according to the Andersen-Gill method 
 
Including all causes of death 
  With imputed time to event information 
  By tipping point 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary variables with imputed time to event information. 
In the primary analysis of the primary endpoints, the patients with incomplete follow-up of the endpoint 
events were censored at the date of last clinical assessment. A multiple imputation approach, based on 
missing-not-at-random assumption, was used to impute the endpoint events (missing data) between the 
censoring date and 21 May 2018, the date when the Executive Committee instructed the sites to 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 15/89
 
  
  
 
 
 
commence closing visit. Specifically, the off-treatment hazard rates from the patients who discontinued 
treatment but continued to be followed up were used to inform the imputation models generating time to 
event for the patients with incomplete follow-up. Of note, patients with endpoint events occurring prior to 
discontinuation of study drug were not used in imputing missing values. The estimated hazard rates and 
the simulations models were adjusted for CV disease history with respect to MACE and for both CV 
disease history and HF history with respect to hHF/CV death. Imputations were conducted separately 
within each treatment group. 
The imputation models were based on an exponential distribution if the assumption of constant hazard 
rates over time was appropriate, or a piece-wise exponential distribution if this assumption is not 
appropriate. For either distribution, the variability in the hazard rate was incorporated by taking a random 
draw of the log hazard rate from a normal distribution. When a simulated time was less than the elapsed 
time between the original censoring date and 21 May 2018, an event was imputed for the corresponding 
patient with the time to event set to be the original censoring date plus the simulated time. Otherwise, 
the patient was censored. Imputed events and time to events were integrated with the observed data and 
analysed using the same statistical model as in the analyses of the dual primary variables. This was 
repeated 1000 times and the results were combined into overall estimates of HRs, p-values, and 95% CIs 
using Rubin’s rules. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary variables by tipping point 
A tipping point analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the statistically significant results, i.e., 
inferiority in MACE and superiority in hHF/CV death. Specifically, various scenarios of the hazard rate in 
the dapagliflozin group, relative to that in the placebo group, were explored to find to a point where the 
statistical significance was lost. For the tipping point analysis, missing data were imputed for patients 
with incomplete follow-up of the endpoint events. Similar to the multiple imputation analysis, the 
estimated hazard rates and the simulations models were adjusted for CV disease history with respect to 
MACE, and for both CV disease history and HF history with respect to hHF/CV death. Imputations were 
conducted separately within each treatment group. 
Exploratory efficacy variables 
For e.g. the changes from baseline to each visit for HbA1c, BP, eGFR, body mass index (BMI), body 
weight, and albumin-to-creatinine ratio analyses were performed using a repeated measures method 
based on all non-missing visit data. Missing data were not imputed. The models included terms for 
treatment group, CV risk category, baseline haematuria, visit, visit*treatment group and baseline as 
covariates providing estimates of the treatment difference with 95% CI and corresponding 2-sided 
nominal p-value. Two-sided 95% CIs for the mean change within each treatment group were calculated.  
Interim analyses 
Two efficacy interim analyses were performed with the study to be considered for an early stop only if 
dapagliflozin provided unequivocal and overwhelming benefit compared with placebo for the occurrence of 
MACE and all-cause mortality. The interim analyses took place when 1/3 and 2/3 of the planned total of 
1390 MACE events had occurred. 
The first interim analysis had a 1-sided α level of 0.00095 and the second interim analysis had a 1-sided 
α level of 0.00614. At each interim analysis, MACE was to be tested at the specified α level, and if 
statistically significant, all-cause mortality was to be tested at the same α level. If superiority had been 
achieved for both endpoints, the DMC was to evaluate the CV and safety data for a decision whether 
justified to stop the study early. Following both interim analyses, the DMC recommended for the study to 
continue as planned.

Interim monitoring for bladder cancers was conducted regularly to be able to communicate potential 
signals with regulatory authorities. Interim analyses for bladder cancer took place after 8, 16, 24, and 32 
events and additional analyses could occur at the discretion of the DMC. The interim analyses were 
assessed at an overall α-level of 0.10 with a Pocock spending rule. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 2 Patient disposition and study participation 
Of the 25 698 subjects enrolled, 8 340 were not eligible for inclusion. The major reasons for not being 
eligible were exclusion criteria on HbA1c (5 903 patients) or renal function (CrCl <60 ml/min; 1824 
patients). 
Duration of follow-up 
The study had a median follow-up time of 4.2 years and 16 906 (98.5%) patients had complete follow-up 
of the first occurrence of the primary efficacy endpoints (see Figure 2).

Completion of the study on study drug 
In total, 13 181 (76.8%) patients completed the study on study drug. There were more patients 
prematurely and permanently discontinuing study drug in the placebo group: 1 807 (21.1%) and 2 144 
(25.0%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. There were 17 randomised patients who 
did not receive any dose of study drug (Figure 3). 
All patients, including those who prematurely permanently discontinued treatment with study drug but 
did not withdraw consent for follow up, were to be followed up until the end of the study. There were 112 
patients who had unknown vital status at the end of the study. Of these, 82 patients withdrew consent 
and 30 patients were lost to follow-up for vital status.

Conduct of the study 
Changes in the conduct of the study 
The original CSP was dated 12 November 2012. Five CSP amendments were prepared; the 4th 
amendment was never implemented. All amendments were approved by the international coordinating 
Investigator. The full EC approved Amendment 5, which involved changes to study objectives. 
Amendments were then approved by local ECs/IRBs and regulatory authorities according to local 
regulations.  
The first amendment came into effect before the inclusion of the first patient. The second and third 
amendments included changes to the enrolment target and measures to ensure that sufficient numbers of 
patients with CV disease were included. The third amendment (April 2014) also included additional AEoSI 
(previously collected in the CRF) but also added new AEoSIs. The fifth amendment came into effect in 
September 2016 and added new safety events for which data were to be collected, i.e. HF that did not 
require hospitalisation, potential DKA, all amputations and related events. Adjudication of all potential 
DKA events was also included. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, there were 1 731 patients with at least 1 important protocol deviation. Important protocol 
deviations were balanced between treatment groups with respect to frequency and type. All important 
protocol deviations were reviewed and agreed before database lock. The most commonly occurring 
protocol deviation was patients assigned a randomisation code according to incorrect entry of baseline 
stratification factors (1 550/1 731). 
Baseline data 
CV disease characteristics and CV risk category 
Overall, 40.6% of patients had established CV disease and 59.4% did not have established CV disease at 
baseline. Most patients without established CV disease had 2 risk factors in addition to T2DM and age 
(≥55 years for men and ≥60 years for women); 74% had dyslipidaemia, 91.3% had hypertension, and 
14.4% were current tobacco users. Ischaemic heart disease was the most common type of CV disease 
(81.1% of patients). The proportions of patients with and without established CV disease at baseline were 
balanced between treatment groups (Table 2).

Table 2 Cardiovascular disease risk category and risk factors (FAS) 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Patient demographic characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 baseline CV risk groups. 
When compared with patients without established CV disease, patients with established CV disease were 
generally younger (mean age 62.6 vs. 64.8 years) and more commonly male (72.1% vs. 56.1%). 
In the overall patient population, mean age was 63.9 years. 46.1% of patients were ≥65 years and 6.4% 
were ≥75 years. 62.6% of patients were male and 37.4% were female. Patients were randomised 
worldwide, with 44.5% of patients randomised in Europe, 31.9% in North America, 10.9% in Latin 
Assessment report

America, and 12.7% in Asia/Pacific. 79.6% of patients were white, 13.4% were Asian, and 3.5% were 
black or African-American. Patient demographic characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment 
groups  
Patient baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 baseline CV risk groups: mean 
duration of T2DM and mean baseline eGFR were similar between baseline CV risk groups. However, when 
compared with patients without CV disease, patients with established CV disease more frequently had a 
history of HF (16.6% vs. 5.6%), baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (9.2% vs. 6.1%), microalbuminuria 
(25.6% vs. 22.0%), and macroalbuminuria (8.3% vs. 5.8%). Additionally, the proportion of patients with 
reported insulin use at baseline was higher in patients with established CV disease (45.7% vs. 37.5%). 
In the overall patient population, most patients were overweight: the mean weight was 90.79 kg and the 
mean BMI was 32.05 kg/m2. The mean duration of T2DM was 11.9 years and the mean HbA1c at 
randomisation was 8.29%. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73m2 and 7.4% of patients had eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 at randomisation; 30.3% of patients had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (ie, 
albumin/creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤300 mg/g or >300 mg/g, respectively). Patient baseline characteristics 
were balanced between the 2 treatment groups. 
Medical history 
CV and other relevant medical history was balanced between the treatment groups. Overall, 89.4% of 
patients had received therapy for hypertension, 40.6% of patients had a history of established vascular 
disease, 20.9% had a history of MI, 18.5% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >130 mg/dL within 12 
months, 14.6% had a history of tobacco usage, 6.5% had a history of ischaemic stroke, 6% had a history 
of peripheral artery disease. 
Use of concomitant medication and treatment compliance 
Medications at randomisation 
Most patients (98.1%) used diabetic medication at baseline and most (approximately 74%) used 2 or 
more diabetic medications. The use of different categories of diabetic medications was balanced between 
treatment groups. Overall, 40.9% of patients used insulin. The most common class of diabetic 
medications was metformin, which was used by 82.0% of patients.  
The use of different categories of CV medications at baseline was balanced between treatment groups. 
The most common categories of baseline CV medications were ACE inhibitor/ARB (81.3% of patients), 
Statin/Ezetimibe (75.0% of patients), and Any antiplatelets (61.1% of patients). Use of CV medications at 
baseline was generally higher in patients with established CV disease compared to patients without 
established CV disease.  
Medications after randomisation 
Patients were to be treated for their T2DM during the study with glycaemic goals as recommended by the 
ADA and EASD and in accordance with local guidelines and practices. 
The use of non-diabetic medications after randomisation was generally balanced between treatment 
groups. Patients in the placebo group used more concomitant diabetic medications. 
Use of prohibited concomitant medications including pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and any SGLT2 inhibitors 
other than study drug was infrequent and generally balanced between treatment groups: overall, 
approximately 6% patients received prohibited concomitant medications, predominantly SGLT2 inhibitors. 
A numerical imbalance in the proportion of patients using SGLT2 inhibitors, other than study drug, at or 
after randomisation was observed: 3.4% in the dapagliflozin group and 6.1% in the placebo group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Summary of testing hierarchy and efficacy results  
The primary safety endpoint was met: Dapagliflozin was non-inferior to placebo for MACE. Confirmatory 
testing proceeded to the primary efficacy variables. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo for reduction of 
the composite of hospitalisation for heart failure and CV death. Superiority of dapagliflozin over placebo 
was not demonstrated for MACE. Confirmatory testing stopped before the secondary variables were 
assessed. However, the incidence of renal composite events was reduced, and there were numerically 
fewer patients with an all-cause mortality event, in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group. 
The confirmatory analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy variables is summarised in Table 4.

Non-inferiority for MACE was tested at α=0.0231 (1-sided). Superiority for hospitalisation for heart failure or CV death, 
and superiority for MACE were tested in parallel following closed testing procedure at α =0.0231 (2-sided); as the 
composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death was statistically significant, the full α was recycled to test MACE at 
α=0.0462 (2-sided). As MACE was not significant the renal composite endpoint and all-cause mortality were not tested 
as part of the confirmatory testing procedure.

Primary variable: Hospitalisation for HF and CV death 
Dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of the composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death (HR 0.83 
[95% CI 0.73 to 0.95], p=0.005). There were 417 and 496 patients with hospitalisation for HF or CV 
death events in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 1000 
patient-years of 12.2 and 14.7 (Table 5).

Exploratory analyses of the single components suggest that the difference in treatment effect was driven 
by hospitalisation for HF (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.61, 0.88]), with no clear difference in CV death (HR 0.98 
[95% CI 0.82 to 1.17]) (Table 5).  
Primary variable: MACE 
Superiority of dapagliflozin over placebo was not demonstrated for MACE variable. There were 
numerically fewer MACE events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (HR 0.93 
[95% CI 0.84 to 1.03], p=0.172). There were 756 vs. 803 patients with CV death, MI, or ischaemic

Single components of MACE were analysed as exploratory variables. The incidence of MI was numerically 
lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.77 to 1.01]), with 
no clear difference observed for CV death or ischaemic stroke (Table 6).  
Renal outcomes 
Secondary variable: Renal composite variables and single components 
Analysis of the secondary renal composite variable was not conducted as part of the confirmatory testing 
sequence.  
The incidence of renal composite events was reduced in the dapagliflozin group compared to the placebo 
group (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.87], nominal p<0.001). There were fewer patients with renal 
composite events in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups: 370 and 480, respectively, corresponding to 
event rates per 1000 patient-years of 10.8 and 14.1 (Table 7 and Figure 6).  
The renal-specific nature of the overall treatment effect was confirmed in a pre-specified exploratory 
analysis of the renal composite without CV death (confirmed sustained ≥40% decrease in eGFR, ESRD, 
and renal death): There were 127 and 238 patients with events of the renal composite without CV death 
in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 1000 patient-years 
of 3.7 and 7.0 (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.66]) (Table 7).

Single components of the renal composite variables were analysed as exploratory variables. The 
difference in treatment effect between groups was driven by the renal components: reduced event rates 
were observed for sustained eGFR decrease (HR 0.54 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.67]) and ESRD events (HR 0.31 
[95% CI 0.13 to 0.79]), and a numerical reduction was observed for renal death events (HR 0.60 [85% 
CI 0.22 to 1.65]) (Table 7).  
Exploratory analyses of pre-specified renal variables 
This section presents exploratory analyses of pre-specified efficacy variables considered supportive to the 
assessment of the efficacy of dapagliflozin for the prevention of new or worsening nephropathy in patients 
with T2DM.  
Albumin to creatinine ratio 
In the overall DECLARE population, increases in UACR occurred at a slower rate in the dapagliflozin group 
compared with the placebo group (Figure 7). 
Patients in the dapagliflozin group with pre-existing albuminuria (UACR ≥30 mg/g) consistently displayed 
reductions of >30% for placebo-corrected change in UACR relative to baseline: -32.06% to -47.97% 
reduction at years 1 to 4.

In patients without pre-existing albuminuria, UACR levels increased over time but at a slower rate in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group.

New onset of albuminuria  
New onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) in the 15 674 patients without pre-existing 
macroalbuminuria was reduced in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (HR 0.54 
[95% CI 0.45 to 0.65], nominal p<0.001) (see Figure 8). 
Similarly, new onset of albuminuria in the 11 644 patients without pre-existing albuminuria was reduced 
in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.72 to 0.87], nominal 
p<0.001).

Regression in severity of albuminuria 
Regression of macroalbuminuria in the 1 169 patients with pre-existing macroalbuminuria was greater in 
the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (HR 1.82 [95% CI 1.51 to 2.20], nominal 
p<0.001) (Figure 9). 
A similar pattern was observed for regression of albuminuria in the 5 199 patients with micro- or 
macroalbuminuria (UACR ≥30 mg/g) at baseline in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group: HR 1.54 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.69), nominal p<0.001.

eGFR: Repeated measures  
A line graph displaying model adjusted mean for eGFR (CKD-EPI) is displayed in Figure 10. Mean eGFR 
decreased over time in both treatment groups. At 6 months, the mean decrease from baseline in eGFR 
was greater in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. After 6 months, the relative rate 
of eGFR decline was lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group, resulting in a 
statistically significant treatment difference in mean change at year 3 and year 4 favouring dapagliflozin.

Secondary variable: All-cause mortality 
Analysis of the secondary all-cause mortality variable was not conducted as part of the confirmatory 
testing sequence.  
The incidence of all-cause mortality was numerically lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group (HR 0.93 [95% CI [0.82 to 1.04], nominal p=0.198). There were 529 and 570 patients 
who died in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 1000 
patient-years of 15.1 and 16.4 (Table 8, and Figure 11).

Sensitivity analyses of the dual primary variables 
A number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses were conducted on the two primary variables. The results 
of these pre-specified sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analyses of both the 
composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death, and MACE. 
A single sensitivity analysis involving imputation of time to event data suggested a beneficial treatment 
effect on MACE. The primary analysis of the primary endpoints assumed non-informative censoring of un-
observed outcomes; patients with incomplete follow-up of primary endpoint events were censored at the 
last date of clinical assessment. However, the DECLARE data indicated that event rates of the primary 
endpoints during the off-treatment period tended to be higher than the event rates observed in the entire 
study, which suggested a possible departure from the assumption of non-informed censoring. This 
possible departure was addressed by a pre-specified sensitivity analysis which used available off-
treatment event rates to impute time to event information for patients with incomplete follow-up (i.e., 
any patients censored before 21 May 2018): under this imputation approach, a positive treatment effect 
on MACE was suggested.   
Ad-hoc sensitivity analyses 
Ad-hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the potential impact of inclusion of deaths due to 
undetermined cause as CV deaths, and exclusion patients who initiated either GLP-1 receptor agonist or 
SGLT2 inhibitor classes of drugs at any time during study, regardless of on- or off- study drug, on the 
primary analyses. The results of these analyses were consistent with the primary analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 34/89
 
  
  
 
 
 
An additional ad-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential impact of discrepancies 
between data entered into the interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) and RAVE database 
on the primary analysis: Patients were randomised using and interactive voice/web response system 
(IVRS/IWRS) operated by site staff and randomisation was stratified by CV risk category (CV risk factors 
or established CV disease), and haematuria status (Yes/No). In accordance with the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP), these randomisation strata were used as covariates in all statistical models. For a substantial 
number of patients (9%) the stratification information entered in the IWRS differed from the information 
entered and verified in the clinical database (RAVE). The discrepancy between the two sources did not 
impact the results and conclusion of the primary endpoints, as demonstrated in a post hoc analysis using 
the RAVE information as covariates. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the primary variables 
Subgroup analyses: composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death 
The benefit of dapagliflozin on the composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death was observed in 
patients with and without established CV disease, and in patients with and without a history of HF at 
baseline (Figure 13).  
Similarly, the benefit of dapagliflozin on the composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death was 
generally consistent across subgroups, including subgroups defined by, age, sex, renal parameters (eGFR 
and UACR), and region. There was no evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups based on interaction 
p-values (Figure 13).

Subgroup analyses: MACE 
As superiority of dapagliflozin compared with placebo was not demonstrated for reduction of the incidence 
of MACE, subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
There was a trend towards an effect of dapagliflozin on MACE in patients with established CV disease at 
baseline (HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.79 to 1.02] nominal p=0.089). However, the analysis of interaction for 
subgroups defined by baseline disease state was not significant (Figure 14).

Subgroup analyses of secondary and related variables  
Subgroup analyses: renal composite variables 
The benefit of dapagliflozin on the secondary renal composite and the renal composite without CV death 
(renal composite variables) was observed in patients with and without established CV disease.  
The benefit of dapagliflozin on the renal composite variables was consistent across subgroups defined by 
baseline renal function (eGFR). A potential interaction was observed for the secondary renal composite on 
subgroup categories defined by baseline UACR; patients with moderately and severely increased 
albuminuria appeared to derive greater benefit than patients with normal to mildly increased albuminuria. 
However, this potential interaction appeared to be driven by CV death; subgroup analyses of the renal 
composite without CV death indicated a consistent treatment benefit for patients with normal to mild to 
moderate, and severely increased albuminuria at baseline Table 9.

Design 
The DECLARE study was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled Phase IIIb study to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on 
cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) with or without established CV disease. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 10 mg dapagliflozin 
once daily or placebo. The study included a placebo run-in period and a 
double-blind treatment period. The study was event-driven with an 
anticipated median duration of 4.5 years and anticipated total duration of 6 
years for the double-blind treatment period.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is based on the recently completed study DECLARE. DECLARE was a Category 3 post-
authorisation safety study (PASS) in the EU (PAM 005) and was further designed to address post-
marketing requirements in the US. 
This was a large placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of adequate design. The study was event-
driven, and patients were followed for approximately 3-5 years. The study included patients with T2DM 
who either had established CV disease or multiple risk factors for CV disease. Exclusion criteria were 
adequate. Patients with conditions likely to limit the possibility to follow-up were excluded. Patients with 
recent acute CV events could be enrolled provided that randomisation did not occur until 8 weeks after 
the event. 
A total of 25 698 patients was enrolled, and 17 160 patients were randomised; 40.6% (6974) with 
established CV disease and 59.4% (10186) without established CV disease. During the study, the number

of subjects to be enrolled was increased (from 22 000 to 27 000) due to a higher screen failure rate than 
initially expected. In the end, approximately 1/3 were screening failures whereof the majority due to 
ineligibility based on HbA1c criteria. As of amendment 3 (28 April 2014), 9 285 patients had been 
randomised and the proportion of patients randomised from the primary and secondary populations were 
approximately 60% and 40%, instead of 33% and 67% respectively, as initially expected. With 
amendment 3, the aim became to continue recruitment allowing patients to be included with no exact 
proportions defined regarding primary and secondary prevention. 
The primary objective was to determine the effect of dapagliflozin relative to placebo on CV outcomes and 
the secondary objective was to determine whether treatment with dapagliflozin compared with placebo 
will result in a reduction of renal events or all-cause mortality. These objectives were adequate. 
The variables included both the composite endpoints and the individual components. Exploratory 
variables included effects on metabolic control and long-term complications. According to the CSR, an 
independent, blinded Clinical Event Adjudication Committee (CEC) adjudicated all primary and secondary 
CV endpoints. The variables selected are adequate. 
The study was event-driven, 1390 subjects with adjudicated MACE events were required, and had a group 
sequential design with two interim analyses to occur when 1/3 and 2/3 of the primary events had been 
observed. A DMC was appointed to assess the interim data outcomes and the study was to be stopped 
only if dapagliflozin was shown to be superior to placebo on both the occurrence of MACE and all-cause 
mortality. The two interim analyses were performed where after the study continued until the prespecified 
number of MACE endpoint events had been reached and, the study remained blinded until database lock.  
Several changes were implemented after study start (via protocol amendments) including changes to 
planned analyses; the most substantive being that hospitalisation for HF, initially a key secondary efficacy 
endpoint, was elevated to a primary efficacy endpoint as a component of a composite with CV death. In 
addition, after data became available suggesting SGLT2 inhibitors have a positive effect on renal 
outcomes, a renal composite endpoint comprising confirmed sustained ≥40% decrease in eGFR, 
confirmed sustained eGFR and/or renal death was added as a secondary efficacy variable. 
The composite of HF hospitalisation and CV death was added as a primary endpoint with study protocol 
amendment 5. The MAH has stated that the changes to the components of composite endpoints and to 
the endpoint hierarchy were not based on knowledge of any blinded or unblinded results from DECLARE 
and that these changes were initiated prior to the first interim analysis conducted by DMC. However, the 
first interim analysis, when 1/3 of the MACE events had accumulated, was seemingly performed in 
February 2016 while amendment 5 was dated 25 September 2016. The MAH was requested to elaborate 
on the time-point for when the changes to the endpoint hierarchy including the adding of a primary 
endpoint, the composite of HF hospitalisation were initiated. In their response the draft protocol 
amendment stated to have been submitted to the FDA in December 2015 has been provided clarifying 
that the draft Protocol Amendment No. 5 was dated 18 December 2015 and also included the proposed 
change regarding the primary objective and the endpoint hierarchy. The changes to the components of 
composite endpoints and to the endpoint hierarchy is thereby accepted as having been initiated before 
the conduct of the interim analysis in February 2016. Upon request, the DMC minutes and the DMC 
charter have also been submitted, documents that, as explained by the MAH, had inadvertently been 
omitted. 
The primary analysis population was FAS that included all randomised patients except for all patients 
randomised (n=30) at a site suspected of GCP violations in another study sponsored by MAH; the 
decision to exclude these was made prior to the unblinding of data. There was no per-protocol population 
defined; overall protocol deviations occurred among approximately 10% of the patients being very similar 
comparing the treatment arms.  Considering the general importance of a PP analysis when the objective 
Assessment report

is non-inferiority; the on-treatment FAS (OT-FAS) including only events that had occurred while on 
treatment (and up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation) is acceptable. Most of the protocol 
deviations were due to that for 9% of the patients the stratification information entered in the IWRS 
differed from the information entered and verified in the clinical database. Randomisation strata were 
used as covariates in all statistical models with the stratification of analyses performed using the 
stratification values as entered in IVRS. This is endorsed. The discrepancy between the two sources was 
however assessed in a post hoc analysis using the database information and was shown not to impact the 
results of the primary endpoints.  
Accounting for the two interim analyses using O-Brian Fleming boundaries, the final analysis was 
performed based on a one-sided alpha of 2.31%. In addition, a closed test procedure was used to control 
for the overall type I error rate across the analyses of the primary and the secondary endpoints. After the 
adding of CF hospitalisation and CV death a primary endpoint, alfa was equally split for the two co-
primary superiority analyses. A hierarchical testing order was used for control of the type I error rate 
across also secondary hypothesis. Hence, multiplicity adjustments were adequate. 
Overall, 98.5% completed the study, i.e. had not withdrawn their consent and were not lost to follow-up. 
Drop-out rates were numerically higher in the placebo-treated group (145 vs 109 in the dapagliflozin 
group), but the difference was small, taking the large size of the study into account.  
A large proportion of patients completed the study on study drug (76.8%). The proportion of patients 
permanently discontinuing study drug was somewhat higher in the placebo treated group (25% vs 
21.1%). Of those who prematurely discontinued study treatment the most common reasons were subject 
decision; 825/1807 (45.7%) and 1086/2144 (50.7%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo arm respectively, 
and occurrence of an AE/SAE; 671/1807 (37.1%) in the dapagliflozin arm and 548/2144 (25.6%) in the 
placebo arm.  
The total study duration was more than 5 years with the last patients included in June 2015, allowing for 
at least 3 years of follow-up. Study duration was very similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo arm with a 
study median follow-up time of 4.2 years. 
A total of 5 amendments were made to the study protocol. The first amendment came into effect before 
the inclusion of the first patient. The 2nd and 3rd amendment included changes to the enrolment target 
and measures to ensure that sufficient numbers of patients with CV disease were included as discussed 
above. The 3rd amendment (April 2014) also included additional AEoSI (previously collected in the CRF) 
but also added new AEoSI. The 5th amendment came into effect in September 2016 and introduced 
changes to the primary endpoint (see discussion above) but also added new safety events for which data 
were to be collected, i.e. HF that did not require hospitalisation, potential DKA, all amputations and 
related events. Adjudication of all potential DKA events was also included. The late addition of AEoSIs 
may have some impact on the safety assessment as discussed in the safety part of this report. 
For each category of protocol deviation, numbers were low except for incorrect entry of baseline 
stratification factors (see discussion above). Protocol deviations were generally balanced between groups. 
The protocol deviations are not considered to have affected the outcome or interpretation of the study 
and the study is considered well conducted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
About 40% of the patients included in the study had established CV disease. Among patients without 
established CV disease, the majority (64%) had 2 risk factors in addition to T2DM and age. There were 
no imbalances between the treatment groups. Neither were any imbalances observed between treatment

Page 41/89
 
  
  
 
 
groups with regards to demographic and baseline characteristics. As may be expected, the patients with 
established CV disease were somewhat older than those without. In the overall population, the medical 
history was typical for a population at high CV risk. A history of HF was more common in the patient with 
established CV disease (16.6% vs. 5.6%). In the overall population, 10% (1724 subjects) had a history 
of HF. Among the patients with HF, 56% were in NYHA Class II, and 7.3% were in NYHA Class III.  
Although almost 2% of patients appears to have been naïve to antidiabetic medication at the time of 
inclusion, the majority were on 2 or more antidiabetic medications and 41% used insulin. As expected, a 
large proportion (82%) were on metformin treatment. CV medications were as expected. 
The primary safety endpoint was met as the upper CI for MACE (CV death, MI and ischaemic stroke) was 
well within the non-inferiority margin of 1.3. Dapagliflozin was found to be superior to placebo for the 
added primary efficacy endpoint of hospitalisation for HF/CV death (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73, 0.95]), 
whereas this was not the case for MACE (HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.84, 1.03]). Therefore, confirmatory testing 
was not conducted for the secondary efficacy endpoints of renal events and all-cause mortality. Several 
pre-defined sensitivity analyses were performed supporting primary results.    
For the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF and CV death, the outcome was driven by the 
reduction in hospitalisations for HF (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.61, 0.88]). Although the number of MACE were 
numerically lower in the dapagliflozin group, superiority versus placebo was not shown. The difference in 
number of events was mainly due to a numerically lower incidence of MI in the dapagliflozin group (393 
vs 441). 
The overall pattern of the outcome compares with the data from the CVOT trial for another SGLT2 
inhibitor (empagliflozin; EMPA-REG OUTCOME), although in the DECLARE study, superiority for 
dapagliflozin versus placebo with regards to MACE could not be shown. In the EMPA-REG 99.5% of 
patients had established CV disease compared to DECLARE where only 40.6% of patients had established 
CV disease. In EMPA-REG, a reduction in CV death and all-cause death was observed, whereas no effect 
on these endpoints were observed with dapagliflozin. When looking at the individual CV endpoints, both 
empagliflozin and dapagliflozin showed the most prominent effect on hospitalisation due to HF, which may 
be explained by the diuretic effect of these compounds. 
The outcome of the secondary endpoint, renal events, was not formally tested. For the composite 
endpoint a HR of 0.76 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.87], was observed, mainly driven by the reduction of sustained 
GFR decrease and ESRD events.  
A number of exploratory endpoints evaluated the effect of dapagliflozin on eGFR and albuminuria. eGFR 
measurements over time show that in the dapagliflozin group there was an initial drop in eGFR during the 
first 6 months after which the decrease in eGFR slowed down. From 6 months and onward the decrease in 
eGFR was slower in the dapagliflozin group, resulting in a higher mean eGFR at 4 years compared to 
placebo. 
The increase in the albumin to creatinine ratio from baseline was slower in the dapagliflozin treated group 
compared to the placebo group and new onset of macroalbuminuria was delayed in the dapagliflozin 
group compared to the placebo group. Regression in severity of albuminuria in patients with pre-existing 
macroalbuminuria was greater with dapagliflozin than with placebo. Notably, improvements were also 
observed in the placebo group. 
Thus, the data provided give no indication of a negative effect on renal function with dapagliflozin 
treatment and indeed, the data indicate that progression of nephropathy was slower in the dapagliflozin 
group compared to the placebo group.  
The HR for all-cause mortality was 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.04). 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 42/89
 
  
  
 
 
In the dapagliflozin group, a mean decrease of -0.7% in HbA1c was observed at 6 months. After that 
time-point, HbA1c slowly increased and the mean change from baseline was -0.4% at 4 years. In the 
placebo group a mean decrease of -0.2% was observed at 4 years. This difference between dapagliflozin 
and placebo is comparable to the difference observed in the EMPA-REG trial at week 206. 
Subgroup analyses for the composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death, the composite of MACE and 
for the renal composite variables showed consistent findings across the subgroups tested. For most of the 
subgroups, the HR point estimate was in favour of dapagliflozin treatment or close to 1.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
DECLARE was a well-designed and well-conducted trial. The trial showed non-inferiority of dapagliflozin to 
placebo on the primary outcome MACE whereas superiority was not shown. A statistically significant 
effect on hospitalisations due to HF was observed, whereas no effect could be shown on CV death or all-
cause mortality. Effects on renal events was investigated and the data indicate that progression of 
nephropathy was slower in the dapagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been amended to include information on the outcome of the DECLARE trial. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin were investigated and documented in the original submission 
for approval of dapagliflozin for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The original T2DM 
submission has been supplemented over time with updated information on the safety and tolerability of 
dapagliflozin, notably with data from a 30-month safety update (30-MSU) cut-off relative to the original 
data cut and with post-marketing data. 
With this submission, information on the safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin in the Phase IIIb 
cardiovascular (CV) outcome study – study D1693C00001 (DECLARE) is provided.  
The safety evaluation does not include pooled analyses of data from DECLARE together with other 
dapagliflozin studies. This approach is considered appropriate given the size of the DECLARE study and 
the differences in study design from previously completed dapagliflozin studies. 
Methods 
DECLARE was a Category 3 post-authorisation safety study (PASS) in the EU (PAM 005). The PASS 
requirement was that DECLARE be designed to evaluate bladder cancer. Other potential safety concerns 
that the European Medicines Agency requested be assessed were clinical consequences of increased 
haematocrit, renal impairment/failure, bone fracture, liver injury, breast cancer, prostate cancer, diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA), amputations, and pancreatitis. Some of these requests were made while the study 
was ongoing. 
Safety variables collected 
The safety database included pre-specified events for which extensive and pre-defined data points were 
collected to allow for a comprehensive assessment of these events. In addition, comprehensive 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 43/89
 
  
  
 
 
prospective and retrospective data collection for amputation and DKA events was implemented during the 
study. 
The safety variables collected were: SAEs, adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug 
(DAEs), amputation events, DKA events, and adverse events of special interest (AEoSIs). The AEoSIs 
were: malignancies, hepatic events, major hypoglycaemic events, fractures, renal events, symptoms 
suggestive of volume depletion, hypersensitivity reactions, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and genital 
infections. All AEs were collected for these events except for hypersensitivity reactions, UTIs, and genital 
infections, for which only SAEs and DAEs were collected.   
Renal events were analysed in 2 ways. Renal events as an AEoSI (hereafter referred to as simply “renal 
events”) were defined and analysed using a broad list of preferred terms (PTs) including PTs suggesting 
any impairment in renal function (acute, chronic, and laboratory changes). In addition, to capture events 
suggestive of acute renal impairment, renal events were analysed using the standardised Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query (SMQ) “Acute renal failure (narrow scope)” 
(hereafter referred to as “events of acute impairment of renal function”). 
In accordance with FDA guidelines (FDA 2008), the primary safety variable of the study was major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which was also one of the dual primary efficacy variables. MACE is 
discussed in detail in the efficacy part of this report. 
Adjudication 
An independent, blinded Clinical Event Adjudication Committee (CEC) adjudicated the following safety 
variables: potential malignancies, hepatic events, and potential DKA events. 
Analysis sets 
Safety analysis set 
The safety analysis set (SAS) included all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of 
randomised study drug and who had data observed at any time after first randomised dose till the end of 
the study. Erroneously treated patients (patients randomised to one treatment group but given the other 
treatment) were included in the group for the treatment they actually received rather than the treatment 
to which they were randomised, if they only received the erroneous treatment and none of the correct 
treatment. The SAS was considered the primary analysis set for malignancies, fractures, and 
amputations. 
On-treatment safety analysis set 
The on-treatment safety analysis set (OT-SAS) included all randomised patients who received at least 1 
dose of study drug and who had data observed at any time after first randomised dose till the end of the 
study, and only observations collected during treatment with study drug or within a certain number of 
days of the last dose of study drug: 
  Continuous safety variables (e.g. lab values and vital signs): within 7 days of last dose of study drug 
  SAEs: within 30 days of last dose of study drug  
  Non-serious AEoSIs: within 7 days of last dose of study drug 
Patient exposure 
The duration of exposure to study drug ranged from 0 to 62 months. In total, there were 30 623 p-y of 
exposure to dapagliflozin in the study. The median duration of exposure to study drug was 48 months in 
both treatment groups (Table 11). In total, there were 69 480 years of follow-up in the study: 34 812

years in the dapagliflozin group and 34 668 years in the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up 
was 50 months in both treatment groups.

Analysis of adverse events 
The SAS is considered the primary analysis set for malignancies, amputations, and fractures, while the 
OT-SAS is considered the primary analysis set for all other safety variables. Data for the primary analysis 
sets for each variable are presented below, except for overall AEs, deaths, SAEs, and DAEs, for which 
both analysis sets are presented.

An overall summary of AEs is shown in Table 12. The numbers of patients with SAEs were balanced 
between treatment groups, while there were more patients with DAEs in the dapagliflozin group 
compared with the placebo group.  
There were fewer patients with renal events or major hypoglycaemic events in the dapagliflozin group 
compared with the placebo group. Definite DKA events were rare overall, but there were more in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. There were more patients with SAEs/DAEs of 
genital infections in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group; the difference was driven 
by non-serious genital infection DAEs. The occurrence of amputations and all other AEoSIs was balanced 
between treatment groups. The findings were generally consistent when analysed by baseline CV risk 
category, with no specific pattern to event occurrence related to baseline CV risk category. 
Only AEs belonging to the categories described in the introduction were collected in the study, and 
therefore, analyses of the most common PTs overall were not performed. All SAEs were collected in the 
study; for the most common PTs for SAEs, refer to Table 13.

Serious adverse events 
The numbers of patients with SAEs were balanced between treatment groups: 37.4% in the dapagliflozin 
group and 39.9% in the placebo group in the SAS, and 34.1% in the dapagliflozin group and 36.2% in 
the placebo group in the OT-SAS. The SOCs and PTs of the most commonly reported SAEs were similar 
between treatment groups. The most common PTs for SAEs in the OT-SAS were Angina unstable, Acute 
myocardial infarction, and Pneumonia in both treatment groups (Table 13).

Deaths 
In the SAS, there were 527 patients (6.1%) in the dapagliflozin group and 566 patients (6.6%) in the 
placebo group who died. In the OT-SAS, there were 392 patients (4.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 
390 patients (4.6%) in the placebo group who died. The SOCs and PTs of deaths were generally balanced 
between treatment groups. Most deaths in both treatment groups occurred in the SOC Cardiac and 
vascular disorders.

Analysis of adverse events by organ system or syndrome 
AEoSI: malignancies 
No overall imbalances in malignancies have been observed between dapagliflozin and comparator in the 
original dapagliflozin clinical development programme (All Phase IIb/III Pool). When examining tumours 
in different organ systems, the relative risk associated with dapagliflozin was above 1 for some tumour 
locations and below 1 for others. The frequencies of bladder cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer 
were higher in dapagliflozin-treated patients than comparator-treated patients, however, event numbers 
were small: 9 (0.14 events per 100 p-y) and 1 (0.03 events per 100 p-y) for bladder cancer, 12 (0.40 
events per 100 p-y) and 3 (0.19 events per 100 p-y) for breast cancer, and 11 (0.30 events per 100 p-y) 
and 6 (0.26 events per 100 p-y) for prostate cancer in the dapagliflozin and comparator groups, 
respectively. No causality has been established. 
Evaluating bladder cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer was an EU post-marketing assessment 
measure (PAM). In addition, interim monitoring for bladder cancers in DECLARE was conducted regularly 
to be able to communicate potential signals with regulatory authorities. 
DECLARE results 
In the DECLARE study, malignancies were analysed overall and by location. All potential 
malignancies/suspect neoplasms except non-melanoma skin cancers were sent for adjudication. Potential 
malignancies adjudicated to be malignancies are summarised below. 
The numbers of patients with adjudicated malignancies were balanced between treatment groups: 481 
(5.6%) and 486 (5.7%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to incidence 
rates of 14.32 and 14.52 events per 1000 p-y (SAS). The relative risk associated with dapagliflozin was 
above 1 for some tumour locations and below 1 for others (Figure 15). The location of events with 
relative risk above 1 for dapagliflozin was not consistent between DECLARE and what was observed in the 
original dapagliflozin clinical programme. The results were consistent when analysed using the OT-SAS.

Malignancies were categorised as “Other known site” when the other prespecified locations were not 
applicable. There was no pattern to the localisation of the “Other known site” malignancies. 
Results for bladder cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer are presented below.  
Bladder cancer 
There were fewer patients with adjudicated bladder cancer in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group: 26 (0.3%) and 45 (0.5%), respectively (SAS), corresponding to incidence rates of 0.76 
and 1.32 per 1000 p-y and an incidence rate ratio of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.95) for dapagliflozin vs 
placebo (Figure 16).

Breast cancer 
The numbers of patients with adjudicated breast cancer were balanced between the treatment groups: 36 
(0.4%) in the dapagliflozin group and 35 (0.4%) in the placebo group (SAS).  
Prostate cancer 
The numbers of patients with adjudicated prostate cancer were balanced between the treatment groups: 
73 (1.4% of male patients) in the dapagliflozin group and 63 (1.2% of male patients) in the placebo 
group (SAS). 
AEoSI: hepatic events 
One case of drug-induced hepatitis and a subsequent diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was reported in 
a dapagliflozin-treated patient in study D1690C00004, described in the 30-MSU. The MAH considered the 
event not likely to be related to study drug. In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, 
no imbalances in liver AEs or marked liver abnormalities have been observed between dapagliflozin and 
comparator treatment. 
Evaluating liver injury in DECLARE was an EU PAM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019

DECLARE results 
Hepatic events were adjudicated for study drug causality. There were no hepatic events for which study 
drug causality was assessed as ‘definite’ or 'highly likely' by the adjudication committee in either 
treatment group. There were no events in the dapagliflozin group and 1 event in the placebo group for 
which study drug causality was adjudicated as ‘probable’ (OT-SAS). 
AEoSI: fractures 
Increased rates of fractures were observed in patients treated with the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin in the CANVAS Program (Neal et al 2017). However, no increased risk of 
fractures has been observed in the EMPA-REG study of empagliflozin (Zinman et al 2015) or in the overall 
dapagliflozin clinical development programme (30-MSU All Phase IIb/III Pool), and in a dedicated study 
(D1690C00012), dapagliflozin had no effect on markers of bone formation and resorption or bone mineral 
density in patients with T2DM after 102 weeks of treatment. These data suggest that the increased 
incidence of fractures observed in the CANVAS Program is not a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. 
Evaluating bone fractures in DECLARE was an EU PAM. 
DECLARE results 
The numbers of patients with fractures were balanced between treatment groups: 457 (5.3%) and 440 
(5.1%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates of 13.6 and 
13.2 events per 1000 p-y (SAS). There were fewer patients with osteoporotic fractures in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. 
AEoSI: adverse events suggestive of volume depletion 
In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, the frequency of AEs suggestive of volume 
depletion was low but slightly higher in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared with placebo-treated 
patients (27 [1.1%] vs 17 [0.7%] in the Placebo-Controlled Pool); however, there were very few serious 
events, and the small number of events did not allow for a complete evaluation of serious volume 
depletion events. 
DECLARE results 
The numbers of patients with AEs suggestive of volume depletion were balanced between treatment 
groups: 213 (2.5%) and 207 (2.4%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding 
to event rates of 7.0 and 7.0 events per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). There were 81 (0.9%) and 70 (0.8%) 
patients with SAEs suggestive of volume depletion in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. 
There were very few patients who had AEs suggestive of volume depletion that led to study drug 
discontinuation in both treatment groups. 
AEoSI: hypersensitivity reactions (SAEs/DAEs) 
There have been spontaneous post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in 
dapagliflozin-treated patients. In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, the incidence 
of serious hypersensitivity reactions was low and generally similar between patients treated with 
dapagliflozin and with comparator (All Phase IIb/III Pool). The small number of events did not allow for a 
complete evaluation of serious hypersensitivity reactions. 
DECLARE results 
There were 15 (0.2%) and 26 (0.3%) patients with SAEs of hypersensitivity reactions in the dapagliflozin 
and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS). There were 19 (0.2%) and 11 (0.1%) patients with DAEs of 
hypersensitivity reactions in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS).

AEoSI: urinary tract infections (SAEs/DAEs) 
In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, the frequency of UTIs was slightly higher in 
dapagliflozin-treated patients than in patients receiving placebo (110 [4.7%] vs 81 [3.5%] in the 
Placebo-Controlled Pool). There were very few serious events, and the small number of events did not 
allow for a complete evaluation of serious UTI events. 
DECLARE results 
The numbers of patients with UTI SAEs/DAEs were balanced between treatment groups: 127 (1.5%) and 
133 (1.6%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates of 4.1 and 
4.5 events per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). There were fewer patients with UTI SAEs in the dapagliflozin group 
compared with the placebo group: 79 (0.9%) and 109 (1.3%), respectively (OT-SAS). SAEs of urosepsis 
were balanced between treatment groups, and there were fewer SAEs of pyelonephritis in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. There were more patients with UTI DAEs in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group: 61 (0.7%) and 35 (0.4%), respectively (OT-SAS). 
Most patients had only 1 UTI. 
AEoSI: genital infections (SAEs/DAEs) 
In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, the frequency of genital infections was 
higher in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared with patients receiving placebo (Placebo-Controlled 
Pool). There were very few serious events, and the small number of events did not allow for a complete 
evaluation of serious genital infections. 
DECLARE results 
There were more patients with genital infections SAEs/DAEs in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group: 76 (0.9%) and 9 (0.1%), respectively, corresponding to event rates of 2.5 and 0.3 events 
per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). The difference was driven by non-serious DAEs of genital infection: there were 
74 (0.9%) and 7 (<0.1%) non-serious DAEs of genital infection in the dapagliflozin group and placebo 
group, respectively (OT-SAS). There were only 2 SAEs of genital infection in each treatment group (OT-
SAS). 
AEoSI: renal events  
In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, events of renal impairment or failure were 
more common in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared with patients receiving placebo (76 [3.2%] vs 
42 [1.8%] in the Placebo-Controlled Pool). SAEs of renal impairment or failure were few in both 
treatment groups. 
Evaluating renal impairment/failure in DECLARE was an EU PAM. 
DECLARE results 
There were fewer patients with renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group: 
422 (4.9%) and 526 (6.1%), respectively, corresponding to event rates of 14.0 and 18.0 events per 1000 
p-y (OT-SAS). There were fewer patients with events reported as acute kidney injury in the dapagliflozin 
group compared with the placebo group: 125 (1.5%) and 175 (2.0%), respectively, of which 67 and 101 
were reported as SAEs (OT-SAS). There were fewer patients with SAEs of renal events in the dapagliflozin 
group compared with the placebo group: 80 (0.9%) and 136 (1.6%), respectively (OT-SAS). There were 
55 (0.6%) and 61 (0.7%) patients with renal events reported as DAEs in the dapagliflozin and placebo 
groups, respectively (OT-SAS). 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 53/89
 
  
  
 
 
There were fewer patients with events of acute impairment of renal function in the dapagliflozin group 
compared with the placebo group: 293 (3.4%) and 376 (4.4%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively, corresponding to event rates of 9.7 and 12.8 events per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). Most events of 
acute impairment of renal function were reported as non-serious AEs: 219 (2.6%) and 254 (3.0%) in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. 
AEoSI: major hypoglycaemic events 
Dapagliflozin reduces blood glucose in a manner dependent on blood glucose concentration. This 
mechanism of action in combination with clinical experience in patients with T2DM suggests that 
dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic risk of hypoglycaemia. However, in patients taking insulin or sulfonylureas 
(SUs) in the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, hypoglycaemic events were more 
common overall and more common in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared with patients receiving 
placebo (Placebo-Controlled Pool). 
DECLARE results 
Major hypoglycaemia was defined as an event where all the following were true: (1) the patient 
experienced symptoms of severe impairment in consciousness or behaviour; (2) the patient needed 
external assistance; (3) intervention was needed to treat the hypoglycaemia; and (4) there was prompt 
recovery of acute symptoms following the intervention. 
There were fewer patients with major hypoglycaemic events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group: 58 (0.7%) and 83 (1.0%), respectively, corresponding to event rates of 1.9 and 2.8 
events per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). Most patients with major hypoglycaemia events in both treatment groups 
were using insulin at the time of the event. In patients using insulin or SUs at the time of the event, there 
were also fewer major hypoglycaemic events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group 
(OT-SAS). 
Other safety event: amputations 
Increased rates of lower-limb amputations were observed in patients treated with the SGLT2 inhibitor 
canagliflozin in the CANVAS Program (Neal et al 2017). However, no increased risk of lower-limb 
amputations has been observed in the overall dapagliflozin clinical development programme or in the 
EMPA-REG study of empagliflozin (Zinman et al 2015). 
Evaluating amputations in DECLARE was an EU PAM and was requested during the study. 
DECLARE results 
The numbers of patients with amputations (surgical and spontaneous/non-surgical) were balanced 
between treatment groups: 123 (1.4%) and 113 (1.3%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively (SAS) (Table 14). Most amputations were reported as SAEs. There were 2 and 4 patients 
with amputations reported as DAEs in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (SAS).

common condition triggering lower-limb amputations was infection in both treatment groups. The most 
common contributing factors to lower-limb amputations were chronic limb ischaemia and neuropathy in 
both treatment groups. 
Other safety event: diabetic ketoacidosis 
There have been post-marketing reports of ketoacidosis, including DKA, in patients with T2DM taking 
dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors, although a causal relationship has not been established. 
Evaluating DKA in DECLARE was an EU PAM. 
DECLARE results 
Potential DKA events were adjudicated and assigned a likelihood of being DKA. Events adjudicated as 
definite DKA or probable DKA are discussed below.  
Definite DKA was defined in the adjudication charter as an event in a clinical setting consistent with DKA 
(history, symptoms, and physical exam), for which no alternative diagnosis was considered a more likely 
primary cause of presentation, and with the following biochemical data: 
  Ketonaemia ≥3.0 mmol/L and/or significant ketonuria (more than 2+ on standard urine sticks), 
and 
  At least one of the following criteria suggesting high anion gap metabolic acidosis:  
-  Arterial or venous pH ≤7.3  
-  Serum bicarbonate ≤18 mEq/L  
-  Anion gap [Na – (Cl + HCO3)] >10 
Probable DKA was defined in the adjudication charter as an event that does not meet strict criteria for 
definite DKA due to incomplete biochemical workup, but for which the clinical setting (history, symptoms, 
and physical exam) is consistent with DKA and there are no alternative diagnoses thought to be the 
primary cause of presentation. Probable was indicated when the adjudicators judged DKA to be the most 
likely clinical diagnosis based on available data. 
There were 71 and 73 potential DKA events sent for adjudication in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively. Events adjudicated as definite or probable DKA were rare overall. There were more patients 
with events of definite or probable DKA in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group: 27 
(0.3%) and 12 (0.1%), respectively, corresponding to event rates of 0.9 and 0.4 events per 1000 p-y1 
(OT-SAS). There were 20 (0.2%) and 9 (0.1%) patients with events of definite DKA and 7 (<0.1%) and 3 
(<0.1%) patients with events of probable DKA in the dapagliflozin group and the placebo group, 
respectively (OT-SAS). 
Events of definite DKA were evenly distributed over time in both treatment groups, and no timepoint was 
identified at which the risk of definite DKA was particularly high (Figure 17). 
1 Event rate per 1000 p-y of events adjudicated as definite or probable DKA is calculated as number of events * 1000/p-y in 
study: 1000*(21+8)/30623=0.9 in the dapagliflozin group and 1000*(9+3)/29749=0.4 in the placebo group.

OT-SAS On-treatment safety analysis set 
The most common contributing factors to definite and probable DKA events were as expected in this 
population and similar between treatment groups (e.g. illness/severe illness, infection, changed or missed 
insulin dose or underdose of insulin, and poor intake of food and/or drink). The most common signs and 
symptoms (as reported by the Investigator) of definite and probable DKA events were as expected for 
DKA events and similar between treatment groups, e.g. abdominal pain, confusion, fatigue, fever sign, 
frequent urination, thirst, fruity scented breath, loss of consciousness, nausea, malaise, vomiting, 
shortness of breath, weakness (OT-SAS). 
Most patients in the dapagliflozin group had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the DKA event 
(16 of 20 patients with definite DKA and 6 of 7 patients with probable DKA). All patients in the placebo 
group with definite or probable DKA events had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the DKA 
event. Three patients in the dapagliflozin group with definite DKA had T1DM; none of the patients in the 
placebo group who had definite DKA had T1DM (OT-SAS).  
There were 4 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 2 patients in the placebo group who died and who 
had definite DKA events occurring in conjunction with the events leading to death. There were 2 patients 
in the dapagliflozin group and 1 patient in the placebo group who died and who had probable DKA events 
occurring in conjunction with the events leading to death. Among these patients, DKA was reported as 
the primary cause of death in 1 patient in the placebo group and as the secondary cause of death in 2 
patients in the dapagliflozin group. The remaining patients did not have DKA reported as a cause of 
death.

Pancreatitis 
Evaluating pancreatitis in DECLARE was an EU PAM. 
DECLARE results 
The numbers of patients with events of pancreatitis SAEs/DAEs were balanced between treatment 
groups: 24 (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and 25 (0.3%) in the placebo group (Table 15). All events 
were reported as SAEs. None of the events in the dapagliflozin group led to discontinuation of study drug.

Clinical consequences of increased haematocrit 
In the original dapagliflozin clinical development programme, small mean increases from baseline were 
observed in haematocrit and haemoglobin in dapagliflozin-treated patients (Placebo-Controlled Pool). 
Marked abnormalities of increased haemoglobin or haematocrit generally occurred in the absence of 
adverse clinical events. 
Evaluating clinical consequences of increased haematocrit was an EU PAM. 
DECLARE results 
There were 202 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 64 patients in the placebo group who had marked 
abnormalities of haematocrit (>55%) or haemoglobin (>18 g/dL). Haematocrit and haemoglobin values 
were recorded every 12 months during the study. There were 681 patients in the dapagliflozin group and

618 patients in the placebo group who had an embolic or thrombotic event (standardised MedDRA query 
Embolic and thrombotic events). 
There were 24 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6 patients in the placebo group who had both 
marked abnormalities of haematocrit or haemoglobin and an embolic or thrombotic event reported at any 
time during the study (Table 16). Review of event narratives suggested that the marked abnormality and 
the event did not occur at the same time during the study in most patients. There were 8 patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 3 patients in the placebo group who had marked abnormalities of haematocrit or 
haemoglobin reported at the study visit closest in time (9 to 282 days) to an embolic or thrombotic event. 
Most of the events were arterial thrombotic or embolic events, and most of the patients had risk factors 
or a medical history of thrombotic or embolic events. 
There was no increased risk of stroke in dapagliflozin-treated patients in DECLARE, and there were 
numerically fewer events of MI in the dapagliflozin group. 
Because only 8 of the 202 patients in the dapagliflozin group with marked abnormalities of haematocrit or 
haemoglobin had thrombotic or embolic events reported at the study visit closest in time to the reporting 
of the abnormality (compared with 3 out of 64 patients in the placebo group), there is no indication that 
the small increases in haematocrit or haemoglobin observed during dapagliflozin treatment are associated 
with an increased risk of thrombotic or embolic events.

Fournier’s gangrene 
The FDA identified a signal of Fournier’s gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis of the genital and perineal area) 
with SGLT2 inhibitors based on post-marketing reports of Fournier’s gangrene in patients treated with 
SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Most of the reports of Fournier’s gangrene in patients treated 
with dapagliflozin contained limited information or included known risk factors for Fournier’s gangrene 
(eg, T2DM and obesity). No cases of Fournier’s gangrene have been identified in dapagliflozin-treated 
patients in MAH-sponsored clinical studies completed before 30 August 2018. 
DECLARE results 
Following communications with the FDA, prior to database lock and treatment allocation unblinding, the 
DECLARE database was broadly searched by PTs indicating genital area infections or necrotizing fasciitis 
(see footnote to Table 17 for the list of PTs). The events were then medically assessed to identify cases of 
Fournier’s gangrene.

Prior to database lock and treatment allocation unblinding for DECLARE, the events were separately 
evaluated by the MAH and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group. Ten events 
were jointly assessed by the MAH and the TIMI Study Group as being Fournier’s gangrene (SAS); 6 of 
these events were on-treatment (OT-SAS). Following unblinding of the DECLARE data, it was determined 
that 2 of the events were in the dapagliflozin group and 8 of the events were in the placebo group (SAS); 
of these, 1 event in the dapagliflozin group and 5 events in the placebo group were on-treatment (OT-
SAS) (Table 18). 
All patients with Fournier’s gangrene were men with T2DM, the group at highest risk for this event. Most 
of the patients had additional risk factors for Fournier’s gangrene (e.g. obesity).

It has been suggested that an increased risk of genitourinary infections associated with SGLT2 inhibitors 
could increase the risk of Fournier’s gangrene. In DECLARE, there was no imbalance in serious genital 
infections or UTIs between treatment groups: there were only 2 SAEs of genital infections in each 
treatment group, and there were fewer SAEs of UTI in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group (79 and 109, respectively). For the 6 cases of Fournier’s gangrene in DECLARE (OT-SAS), no 
events of genital infections or UTIs were recorded proximate, or at any time prior, to the Fournier’s 
gangrene event. Non-SAEs/DAEs of genital infections or UTIs were not to be reported in DECLARE. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Haematology 
Mean haematocrit and haemoglobin levels initially increased in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group and then plateaued. The increases were not considered clinically relevant. 
Clinical chemistry 
Changes in blood chemistry values over time 
There were no clinically relevant changes in blood alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBL), or alkaline phosphatase in either treatment group. Serum

creatinine increased slightly in both treatment groups. There were mean decreases in creatinine clearance 
that were similar between treatment groups. eGFR decreased over time in both treatment groups. At 1 
year, mean eGFR was slightly lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group, and at 4 
years, mean eGFR was slightly higher in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. Blood 
glucose decreased from baseline in the dapagliflozin group over time and remained unchanged in the 
placebo group. 
Changes in blood lipids over time 
There were no clinically relevant changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density 
lipoprotein, or triglycerides in either treatment group. 
Elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase accompanied by elevations in total 
bilirubin 
Any patient with AST or ALT ≥3x upper limit of normal and TBL ≥2x upper limit of normal at any point 
during the study was to have their study drug discontinued and the event reported as an SAE. There were 
24 (0.3%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 20 (0.2%) patients in the placebo group meeting these 
criteria. None of the events in the dapagliflozin group had study drug causality assessed as ‘definite’, 
'highly likely', or ‘probable’ by the adjudication committee. 
Other marked laboratory abnormalities 
There were fewer patients with marked abnormalities of creatinine, creatinine clearance, eGFR, and urine 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. There were fewer 
patients with marked abnormalities of hyperkalaemia in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group. There were more patients with marked abnormalities of haematocrit and haemoglobin in 
the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. 
Urinalysis 
Urine albumin, urine creatinine, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were lower in the dapagliflozin 
group compared with the placebo group at 4 years. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Systolic blood pressure decreased in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. There 
were no clinically relevant changes in diastolic blood pressure or pulse rate in either treatment group.

Effect of sex 
Malignancies, fractures and osteoporotic fractures, UTI SAEs/DAEs, genital infection SAEs/DAEs, and AEs 
leading to amputations were analysed by sex. Key findings in the sex subgroup analyses were: 
  Malignancies, fractures and osteoporotic fractures, and AEs leading to amputations were balanced 
between treatment groups in both the male and female subgroups. 
 
There were 40 (0.7%) and 61 (1.1%) males and 39 (1.2%) and 48 (1.5%) females with UTI SAEs in 
the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS). There were 23 (0.4%) and 9 (0.2%) 
males and 38 (1.2%) and 26 (0.8%) females with UTI DAEs in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively (OT-SAS).

 
There were more patients with genital infection DAEs in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group in both the male and female subgroups. In males, there were 2 SAEs of genital 
infection in each treatment group, and in females, there were no SAEs of genital infection (OT-SAS). 
 
There were fewer patients with renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group in both the male and female subgroups. 
Effect of age 
Exposure and overall AEs in patients ≥75 years of age 
A total of 1092 patients in the study were ≥75 years of age. The median duration of exposure to study 
drug in patients ≥75 years of age was 47 months in both treatment groups. 
An overall summary of AEs in patients 75 years of age is shown in Table 19; refer to Table 12 for the

Key findings in patients 75 years of age were: 
 
The incidence of SAEs and DAEs were balanced between treatment groups. 
  Malignancies were balanced between treatment groups. 
 
There were 40 (7.4%) and 32 (5.8%) patients with fracture events in the dapagliflozin and placebo 
groups, respectively (SAS). 
  AEs suggestive of volume depletion were balanced between treatment groups. 
-  AEs suggestive of volume depletion were reported for 21 (3.9%) and 31 (5.6%) patients 75 
years of age in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS). 
-  SAEs suggestive of volume depletion were reported for 11 (2.0%) and 16 (2.9%) patients 75 
years of age in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS) (see Table 8.18). 
  UTI SAEs were reported for 11 (2.0%) and 8 (1.4%) patients 75 years of age in the dapagliflozin 
and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS) (see Table 8.18). 
  UTI DAEs were reported for 9 (1.7%) and 2 (0.4%) patients 75 years of age in the dapagliflozin and 
placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS) (see Table 8.18). 
 
There were fewer renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group.  
-  Renal AEs were reported for 48 (8.9%) and 62 (11.2 %) patients 75 years of age in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS).  
-  Renal SAEs were reported for 7 (1.3%) and 18 (3.2%) of patients 75 years of age in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS) (see Table 8.18). 
  Amputations were balanced between treatment groups. 
Results of subgroup analyses of patients 75 years of age indicate that the safety profile of dapagliflozin 
in patients 75 years of age is consistent with the safety profile of dapagliflozin in the overall population. 
Analyses of AEoSIs in <65 and  65-year age subgroups 
Malignancies, fractures and osteoporotic fractures, symptoms suggestive of volume depletion, UTI 
SAEs/DAEs, genital infection SAEs/DAEs, renal events, and AEs leading to amputations were analysed for 
patients <65 and 65 years of age. Key findings in the <65 and 65-year age subgroups were: 
  Malignancies were balanced between treatment groups in both the <65 and 65-year age subgroups. 
 
Fractures were balanced between treatment groups in both the <65 and 65-year age subgroups. 
There were fewer osteoporotic fractures in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group 
in both the <65 and 65-year age subgroups. 
  AEs suggestive of volume depletion were generally balanced between treatment groups in both the 
<65 and 65-year age subgroups.  
-  AEs suggestive of volume depletion were reported for 96 (2.1%) and 86 (1.9%) patients <65 
years of age and 117 (3.0%) and 121 (3.1%) patients ≥65 years of age in the dapagliflozin and 
placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS).  
-  SAEs suggestive of volume depletion were reported for 30 (0.6%) and 26 (0.6%) patients <65 
years of age and for 51 (1.3%) and 44 (1.1%) patients ≥65 years of age in the dapagliflozin and 
placebo groups, respectively (OT-SAS).

 
There were fewer UTI SAEs and more UTI DAEs in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group in both the <65 and 65-year age subgroups. 
There were more patients with non-serious DAEs of genital infection in the dapagliflozin group 
compared with the placebo group in both the <65 and 65-year age subgroups. 
There were fewer renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group in both the 
<65 and 65-year age subgroups.  
-  Renal AEs were reported for 176 (3.8%) and 215 (4.7%) patients <65 years of age and 246 
(6.2%) and 311 (7.9%) patients ≥65 years of age in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively (OT-SAS).  
-  Renal SAEs were reported for 34 (0.7%) and 54 (1.2%) of patients <65 years of age and 46 
(1.2%) and 82 (2.1%) of patients ≥65 years of age in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively (OT-SAS). 
  AEs leading to amputations were balanced between treatment groups in both the <65 and 65-year 
age subgroups. 
Results of age subgroup analyses indicate that the safety profile of dapagliflozin is consistent between 
patients <65 and 65 years of age. 
Effect of renal function 
There were 1 262 patients in total who had baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 15 880 patients in 
total who had baseline eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (OT-SAS).  
The proportion of patients with events of sustained confirmed eGFR decrease ≥40% was analysed for 
patients with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Among these patients, there were fewer patients in 
the dapagliflozin group with events of sustained confirmed eGFR decrease ≥40% compared with the 
placebo group. 
Fractures and osteoporotic fractures, symptoms suggestive of volume depletion, renal events, and AEs 
leading to amputations were analysed by baseline eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 
m2, and ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 [EPI-CKD]). Key findings in eGFR subgroups were: 
 
Fractures and osteoporotic fractures and AEs leading to amputations were balanced between 
treatment groups across eGFR subgroups. 
  AEs suggestive of volume depletion were balanced between treatment groups across eGFR 
subgroups, except that there were more patients with SAEs suggestive of volume depletion in the 
dapagliflozin group with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline compared with the placebo group (19 
and 13 events, respectively). 
 
There were fewer renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group across 
eGFR subgroups. 
Renal events were also analysed by albumin/creatinine ratio (<30 mg/g, ≥30 to ≤300 mg/g, >300 
mg/g). There were fewer renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group across 
albumin/creatinine ratio subgroups. 
Results of these subgroup analyses indicate that the safety profile of dapagliflozin is generally consistent 
regardless of renal function. 
Other intrinsic factors 
Additional subgroup analyses included analyses of AEs suggestive of volume depletion and renal events 
by systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline; analyses of renal events and AEs leading to 
amputations by diabetes duration; and analysis of AEs leading to amputations by peripheral arterial 
disease at baseline. The results of these subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the overall 
analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019

There were more patients with AEs leading to amputations in patients with peripheral arterial disease at 
baseline in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (43 and 28 patients, respectively), 
and fewer AEs leading to amputations in patients without peripheral arterial disease at baseline in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (75 and 85 patients, respectively). There was no 
consistent pattern to the occurrence of AEs leading to amputations across the subgroups analysed, 
suggesting the variability is due to the small subgroup sizes. 
Extrinsic factors 
AEs suggestive of volume depletion and renal events were analysed by diuretic use at baseline and 
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use at baseline. AEs 
suggestive of volume depletion were also analysed by loop diuretic use at baseline. AEs leading to 
amputations were analysed by diuretic and loop diuretic use at baseline. Key findings in these subgroup 
analyses were: 
  AEs suggestive of volume depletion were balanced between treatment groups across subgroups with 
and without baseline diuretic, loop diuretic, or ACEi/ARB use.  
 
There were fewer renal events and fewer serious events of acute impairment of renal function in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group across subgroups with and without baseline 
diuretic or ACEi/ARB use. 
  AEs leading to amputations were balanced between treatment groups across subgroups with and 
without baseline diuretic or loop diuretic use. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information is available on the potential impact on safety of such interactions in patients with 
T2DM and CV risk factors or established CV disease. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were more patients with DAEs in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group: 8.1% 
and 6.9% of patients, respectively (OT-SAS). The most common PTs for DAEs in the dapagliflozin group 
were Urinary tract infection, Balanoposthitis, and Pollakiuria, which were more common in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (OT-SAS). The most common PTs for DAEs in the 
placebo group were Urinary tract infection, Bladder cancer, and Acute kidney injury (OT-SAS) (Table 20).

Post marketing experience 
Dapagliflozin was first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in Australia on 05 October 2012 and 
it is currently approved in over 90 countries. Post-marketing experience in the approved T2DM indication 
is summarised in regular periodic benefit-risk evaluation reports (PBRERs) that are submitted to 
regulatory authorities worldwide. The most recent PBRER, with a data lock of 04 October 2018 and 
including approximately 4 856 324 p-y of post-marketing exposure globally (cumulative until 30 
September 2018), concluded that a comprehensive review of clinical studies and post-marketing 
experience revealed no new information to alter the overall positive benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin in 
the approved indication. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin were investigated and documented in the original submission 
for approval of dapagliflozin for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The original T2DM 
submission has been supplemented over time with updated information on the safety and tolerability of 
dapagliflozin, notably with data from a 30-month safety update (30-MSU) cut-off relative to the original 
data cut and with post-marketing data. The original dapagliflozin clinical development programme 
included 21 active- and placebo-controlled studies and 9 885 years of exposure (6 247 p-y in the 
dapagliflozin group and 3638 p-y in the comparator group), and the placebo-controlled pool, which 
included 13 placebo-controlled studies and 4 682 p-y of exposure (2 438 p-y in the dapagliflozin group 
and 2 244 p-y in the placebo group); these were documented in the 30-MSU. With this submission the 
exposure data have been substantially extended. Most importantly, patients have been followed for a 
median of 50 months. The data from DECLARE has not been pooled with data from previous studies. This 
is acceptable due to the differences in the study designs and the collection of safety data. 
DECLARE is included in the RMP for dapagliflozin a Category 3 PASS, in order to further study safety 
concerns identified at the time of the MAA but also identified after the launch of the product. As opposed 
to the studies in the MAA, only selected (non-serious) AEs were collected in addition to SAEs and DAEs. 
Adjudication of important safety variables were performed. 
The DECLARE study provides long-term exposure data in a large number of patients, with more than 
4 000 patients followed for four years and some patients followed up to five years. Although drop-out 
rates were slightly higher in the placebo group, the numbers still remained comparable up to EOT. 
Patients with HF NYHA class I-III, previously not included in the clinical study program, were eligible for 
inclusion in the study. Overall, 1724 patients (10% of the total population) were included in the study. In 
total 56% of patients with HF were in NYHA class II and 7.3% (125 patients) were in NYHA class III. 
There was no imbalance between treatment groups. 
SAEs and AEoSIs were generally balanced between treatment groups. Genital infections, DKA and 
embolic or thrombotic events AND marked abnormality in haematocrit or haemoglobin were the only 
AEoSI with a higher reporting in the dapagliflozin groups, whereas renal events, hypoglycaemias and

Fournier’s gangrene was more commonly reported in the placebo group. The pattern was consistent for 
both the SAS and the OT-SAS. 
SAEs were generally well balanced, with less than an 0.2% difference between treatment groups for most 
PTs.  HF and acute kidney injury were somewhat more common in the placebo group, in line with the 
data presented in the efficacy part of this report. The occurrence of death was balanced between groups 
and in both analysis populations. All-cause mortality and CV death are further discussed in the efficacy 
part of this report. 
During the study, patients were to be treated according to local guidelines and practices in order to 
achieve glycaemic goals, although some medications (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and SGLT2 inhibitors) 
were prohibited. In spite of measures taken, 113 patients in the dapagliflozin treated group were treated 
with dual SGLT2i. The majority (86 out of 113) however stopped dual treatment within 3 months. Thus, 
the exposure is limited, but no unexpected safety issues emerged in this small population. 
During the assessment of the original MAA, imbalances in the occurrence of bladder cancer, breast 
cancer, and prostate cancer were observed which led to concerns on that dapagliflozin could carry an 
increased risk of malignancies, although the overall incidence did not differ from comparators. The data 
from DECLARE, which has a considerably longer follow-up (up to 5 years) and includes a large number of 
patients, the overall incidence rates of malignancies did not differ between dapagliflozin and placebo 
(14.32 and 14.52 events per 1000 p-y). The relative risks varied around 1 but CIs were wide and 
included 1 for all types of cancer except bladder cancer (in favour of dapagliflozin) and “Other known site” 
(in favour of placebo). 
In DECLARE, the relative risk of bladder cancer was lower with dapagliflozin than with placebo (HR 0.57 
[95% CI: 0.35, 0.93]), the number of breast cancer cases was similar in both groups (36 (0.4%) vs 35 
(0.4%)) and a higher number of prostate cancer cases were observed in the dapagliflozin group (73 
(1.4% of male patients) vs 63 (1.2% of male patients)). 
Although 3 to 5 years of exposure is not sufficient to rule out a cancerogenic effect, no overall imbalance 
was observed in the overall incidence in the original studies and there are no non-clinical findings 
suggestive of a genotoxic effect of dapagliflozin. The additional data obtained with DECLARE have not 
strengthened but rather weakened the pattern observed in the MAA with e.g. a lower incidence of bladder 
cancer. 
Concerns were raised during the original MAA on the risk of hepatic events with dapagliflozin, based on 
one case of autoimmune hepatitis. In DECLARE, no hepatic events assessed as definite or highly likely to 
be caused by dapagliflozin was observed. 
Due to findings in the CANVAS program for another SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin), and the fact that in 
the initial data provided with the MAA for dapagliflozin, concerns were raised that treatment with 
dapagliflozin may be associated with an increased risk of fractures, evaluation of bone fractures was 
included in DECLARE as a PAM. Data from the CVOT for another SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin), have not 
shown an increased risk. Data from the dedicated dapagliflozin study D1690C00012 have not shown any 
negative effect on bone markers or BMD. In the DECLARE study, the number of patients with fractures 
were balanced between treatment groups (5.3% vs 5.1%). Thus, there was no evidence for an increased 
risk of fractures with the use of dapagliflozin. 
AEs suggestive of volume depletion were somewhat more common in the dapagliflozin group in the 
clinical development program. In DECLARE, the AEs suggestive of volume depletion included e.g. 
hypotension, syncope and shock. These events were balanced between treatment groups (213 (2.5%) 
and 207 (2.4%)). Thus, these data concerning events suggestive of volume depletions appear reassuring 
but are not considered sufficient to remove warnings regarding the risk of volume depletion on an 
Assessment report

individual basis. Volume depletion should however also be considered in relation to the data on 
haematocrit and thromboembolic events.  
The MAH investigated the clinical consequences of increased haematocrit as requested. There was an 
imbalance between treatment groups with a higher reporting of both embolic and thrombotic events 
(7.9% with dapagliflozin and 7.2% with placebo) and the reporting of marked abnormalities in 
haematocrit or haemoglobin with dapagliflozin (2.4%) compared to placebo (0.7%). In patients 
experiencing both events, there was however no clear temporal association between the occurrence of 
abnormal haematocrit and a thromboembolic event. An association can however not be entirely ruled out 
and since the change in haematocrit is most likely due to volume depletion, this is still considered to be a 
risk with dapagliflozin treatment, especially in vulnerable patients. 
Overall the incidence of serious hypersensitivity reactions was lower with dapagliflozin than with placebo 
(15 (0.2%) and 26 (0.3%)), although there were more patients with DAEs of hypersensitivity reactions in 
the dapagliflozin group. 
Non-serious UTIs are a known side effect of dapagliflozin. The results from DECLARE indicated that 
dapagliflozin is associated with UTI DAEs, but there is no evidence that dapagliflozin is associated with an 
increased risk of serious UTIs, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, as there were fewer patients with 
UTI SAEs in the dapagliflozin group (79 (0.9%) and 109 (1.3%)). 
There were more patients with genital infections SAEs/DAEs in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group: 76 (0.9%) and 9 (0.1%), respectively, corresponding to event rates of 2.5 and 0.3 events 
per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). The difference was driven by non-serious DAEs of genital infection, thus the data 
does not indicate that dapagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of serious genital infections.  
There were fewer patients with renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group 
(422 (4.9%) and 526 (6.1%)). The same pattern was observed for acute kidney injury, SAEs and DAEs. 
Thus, these data do not indicate that the use of dapagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of renal 
events. The effect of dapagliflozin on renal function is also presented in the efficacy part of this report.  
In DECLARE only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. Previous data from the placebo-controlled 
studies have indicated an increased risk of hypoglycaemias in patients on concomitant treatment with 
dapagliflozin and insulin or SU compared to patients on placebo (and insulin or SU). In DECLARE, major 
hypoglycaemic events were few (58 (0.7%) and 83 (1.0%), dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively) 
especially taking the size and duration of the study into account. The number of events was lower for 
dapagliflozin, both in the overall population and in the subgroup using insulin or SU. 
Amputations was introduced as an AEoSI during the course of the study due to a signal raised based on 
data for another SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin. The amendment that included amputations as an AEoSI 
was made in September 2016, i.e. two years before the study was closed. The MAH has provided data 
that show that there was no change in the reporting rate with the introduction of the amendment. The 
data presented does not indicate any apparent increased risk of amputations with dapagliflozin compared 
to placebo (123 (1.4%) and 113 (1.3%)). It is however noted that there were more patients in the 
dapagliflozin groups who had more than 1 amputation (45 vs 30) and also more patients with 
amputations below and above the knee (46 vs 30).  
When analysed by subgroups based on risk factors for amputations, the overall point estimate favours 
placebo, but events are few and the confidence intervals are wide. As a result, no statistically significant 
differences between treatments are observed for any of the subgroups. Notably the point estimates are in 
favour of dapagliflozin for the most vulnerable groups whereas the point estimates are in favour of 
placebo for subgroups theoretically at lower risk. The only exception from this observation is in patients 
with a history of PAD where the point estimate is 1.49 (0.93 to 2.39).  
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 69/89
 
  
  
 
 
Overall, the data do not support an increased risk of amputation or more complicated amputation with 
dapagliflozin treatment. However, taking the diuretic effect of dapagliflozin into account (that may 
jeopardise the peripheral circulation) as well as the observation for canagliflozin, the class warning 
regarding a potential risk in vulnerable patients should remain in section 4.4. 
The large size of the DECLARE study population allowed for a clinically meaningful evaluation of DKA, a 
rare event in patients with T2DM, in dapagliflozin-treated patients compared with previously available 
data. The amendment by which DKA was included as an AEoSI was introduced in September 2016, i.e. 
two years before the closure of the study. The MAH has clarified that no measures to prevent DKA was 
introduced during the study. There was no change in the reporting rate of DKA with the introduction of 
the amendment. The DECLARE results showed that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation 
between dapagliflozin and DKA, although DKA events were rare overall. The clinical presentation, risk 
factors, and contributing factors of DKA events in dapagliflozin-treated patients are similar to what is 
generally observed for DKA events. As observed for the T1DM population, the events were evenly 
distributed over time.   
Events of pancreatitis were also collected. There was no difference in the number or type of events 
between treatment groups (24 (0.3%) with dapagliflozin and 25 (0.3%) with placebo). Thus, the data 
give no indication of an increased risk of pancreatitis with dapagliflozin treatment.  
Following the signal of Fournier’s gangrene with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, but prior to database lock 
and unblinding, the DECLARE safety database was retrospectively searched for events suggestive of 
Fournier’s gangrene. There were 18 patients with events with PTs indicating genital area infections or 
necrotizing fasciitis: 8 (<0.1%) and 10 (0.1%) the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Ten of 
these cases were adjudicated as Fournier’s gangrene, out of which 2 were treated with dapagliflozin. The 
data provided does not indicate an increased risk of Fournier’s gangrene with dapagliflozin treatment, 
although it should be taken into account that data was retrospectively collected in a database where only 
SAEs were routinely reported. 
Apart for the data on haematocrit (see above), there were no remarkable findings with regards to 
laboratory values. As noted in the efficacy part of this report, eGFR was lower in the dapagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group after 1 year whereas eGFR was higher than for placebo after 4 years. Although 
numerically slightly more patients showed increased AST, ALT or total bilirubin levels in the dapagliflozin 
group compared to placebo, this was not reflected as an increase in hepatic events. 
When the safety was assessed by sex, the only apparent difference observed was a higher reporting of 
UTI SAEs in females in both treatment groups and the reporting was lower in the dapagliflozin group than 
in the placebo group. UTI DAEs were more common in the dapagliflozin groups than in the placebo 
groups and more common in females than in males. 
DECLARE included 1092 patients 75 years of age out of which 537 were treated with dapagliflozin. The 
overall reporting of SAEs and AEoSIs was about twice as high in the population 75 years of age 
compared to the overall population, but the reporting was balanced between groups. The overall safety 
profile was comparable to that of the overall population. When analysed by an age cut-off of 65 years, a 
slightly higher reporting of AEs was observed in the older age group, but the safety profile did not differ 
in the older age group compared to the younger age group. 
Effect of renal function on the safety profile was also evaluated. Apart from events suggestive of volume 
depletion, that were more common in patients with eGFR <60 treated with dapagliflozin than in those on 
placebo, there were no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with declining renal function. 
Furthermore, as discussed in the efficacy part of the report, renal events were less common in the 
dapagliflozin group compared to placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 70/89
 
  
  
 
 
AEs suggestive of volume depletion, renal events and amputations were analysed by extrinsic factors, 
such as use of ACEi/ARB and loop diuretics at baseline. These analyses could not identify any influence on 
these events by the extrinsic factors tested. 
There were somewhat more patients with DAEs in the dapagliflozin group (8.1%) than in the placebo 
group (6.9%). Among the most common DAEs the largest numerical imbalance was observed for UTI, 
Balanoposthitis, and Pollakiuria which were more common in the dapagliflozin group. Numerically more 
patients on placebo reported DAEs Bladder cancer or Acute kidney injury. 
No new safety concerns have arisen since the signal on Fournier’s gangrene was evoked for the class of 
SGLT2 inhibitors. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The DECLARE study provides long-term data in a large number of patients treated with dapagliflozin and 
was designed to address a number of safety concerns raised in the assessment of the documentation for 
the MAA. No new safety concerns arise from the data provided.  
The study included a substantial number of elderly subjects (75 years of age) with no indication of a 
different safety profile compared to placebo, supporting the proposed changes to the SmPC for this 
population. Relevant numbers of patients with HF (NYHA Class I-III) were also included. The data 
provided does not raise any safety concerns with the use of dapagliflozin in patients with HF (NYHA class 
I-III) and supports the removal of the warning on lack of experience in this patient group from section 
4.4. 
Data have also been provided on the following safety concerns listed in the RMP: volume depletion, 
clinical consequences of increased haematocrit, bone fracture, serious hypersensitivity reactions and 
pancreatitis, and for which no other PhV activities than DECLARE are ongoing. In addition, data on 
malignancies and specifically bladder cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, has been provided.  No new 
safety concerns arise from the data provided. 
Concerning volume depletion and clinical consequences of increased haematocrit, there are still 
uncertainties with regards to the risk with dapagliflozin use, but the SmPC contains adequate information. 
With regards to the potential risk of amputations the data does not indicate an increased risk with 
dapagliflozin use, but the class warning should remain in the SmPC. 
The data from DECLARE is considered sufficient to conclude that dapagliflozin treatment is not associated 
with an increased risk of bone fracture, serious hypersensitivity reactions or pancreatitis. 
The safety information in the SmPC has been updated based on the submitted data. The proposed 
changes to the RMP are further discussed in section 2.6 of this report. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  Risk management plan for dapagliflozin 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 17.3 for dapagliflozin is acceptable.  
In addition, a revision of the RMP is recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update as 
such: the MAH is requested to reinstate the category 3 study on “Knowledge and understanding of 
additional RMM for DKA in Health Care Professionals and Patients”, in the pharmacovigilance plan of the 
dapagliflozin RMP (please see further information under the Pharmacovigilance Plan subsection below). 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 17.3 with the following content:

As a result of this variation, section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated based on 
the data obtained with the DECLARE study. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to the full text of the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA. However, the changes to the package leaflet are limited and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is changed as shown here: 
“Forxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise 
- 
- 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance. 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
For study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control, cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
T2DM is associated with CV and renal complications. There is increasing recognition of the overlap in CV 
and renal disease; primary dysfunction in either the heart or kidneys often results in secondary 
dysfunction or injury in the other organ. For example, kidney damage is more strongly associated with 
development of CV disease, and in particular HF and CV death, than traditional CV risk factors such as 
hypertension and dyslipidaemia. This confluence of cardiac and renal disease, often referred to as cardio-
renal syndrome, is accentuated by T2DM resulting in a vicious circle consisting of T2DM, HF, and chronic 
renal disease. 
The estimated prevalence of CV disease in patients with T2DM ranges from 14.8% to 40.5% depending 
on age and region with HF more prevalent than history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. CV disease 
is the most common cause of death in patients with T2DM, with at least 50% of T2DM patients globally 
dying from CV disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 80/89
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As a result of the FDA requirements to exclude an increased CV risk associated with products intended for 
the treatment of patients with T2DM, several CVOTs have been or are being performed.   
DECLARE evaluated the effect of dapagliflozin compared to placebo on cardiovascular (CV) and renal 
outcomes in a broad T2DM population with or without established CV disease. In the EU DECLARE was a 
post-authorisation safety study (PASS); the PASS requirement was that DECLARE be designed to 
evaluate bladder cancer. Other potential safety concerns that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
requested be assessed were clinical consequences of increased haematocrit, renal impairment/failure, 
bone fracture, liver injury, breast cancer, prostate cancer, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), amputations, and 
pancreatitis. Some of these requests were made while the study was ongoing. 
Some of these CVOT studies have shown a (modest) superior effect compared to placebo in prevention of 
CV events while others have reported a neutral effect.  The vast majority of these studies have mainly 
included patients with established CV disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
The DECLARE study, was a post-marketing study that evaluated the effect of dapagliflozin on CV events 
with the aim to exclude increased CV risk and evaluating a potential CV benefit. The primary endpoint 
was the composite of CV death, MI and ischemic stroke (MACE).  A composite of heart failure 
hospitalisation and CV death was added as an additional primary efficacy variable while the study was 
ongoing. The secondary objective of the study was to determine the effect on renal events and all-cause 
mortality. The renal composite endpoint was defined as confirmed sustained ≥40% decrease in eGFR to 
eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 and/or ESRD (dialysis ≥90 days or kidney transplantation, confirmed sustained 
eGFR <15ml/min/1.73m2) and/or renal or CV death (time to first event). 
DECLARE included 17160 randomised and assessed T2DM patients, including both patients with 
established CV disease (6974; 40.6%) and without established CV disease (10186; 59.4%) who were 
followed for a median of 4.2 years.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary safety endpoint was met as the upper CI for MACE (CV death, MI and ischaemic stroke) was 
well within the non-inferiority margin of 1.3; HR 0.93 [95%CI 0.84-1.03].  
Dapagliflozin was found to be superior to placebo for the additional primary efficacy endpoint of 
hospitalisation for HF/CV death (HR 0.83 [95%CI 0.73, 0.95]).     
For the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF and CV death, the outcome was driven by the 
reduction in hospitalisations for HF (HR 0.73 [95%CI 0.61, 0.88]) and there was no difference in the 
incidence of CV death. 
The outcome of the secondary endpoint, renal events, was not formally tested. For the composite 
endpoint a HR of 0.76 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.87], was observed, mainly driven by the reduction of sustained 
GFR decrease and ESRD events.  
A number of exploratory endpoints evaluated the effect of dapagliflozin on eGFR and albuminuria. eGFR 
measurements over time show that in the dapagliflozin group there was an initial drop in eGFR during the 
first 6 months after which the decrease in eGFR slowed down. From 6 months and onward the decrease in 
Assessment report  
EMA/476671/2019 
Page 81/89
 
  
  
 
 
 
eGFR was slower in the dapagliflozin group, resulting in a higher mean eGFR at 4 years compared to 
placebo. 
The increase in the albumin to creatinine ratio from baseline was slower in the dapagliflozin treated group 
compared to the placebo group and new onset of macroalbuminuria was delayed in the dapagliflozin 
group compared to the placebo group. Regression in severity of albuminuria in patients with pre-existing 
macroalbuminuria was greater with dapagliflozin than with placebo. Notably, improvements were also 
observed in the placebo group. 
The HR for all-cause mortality was 0.93 [95% CI 0.82-1.04] 
In the dapagliflozin group, a mean decrease of -0.7% in HbA1c was observed at 6 months. After that 
time-point, HbA1c slowly increased and the mean change from baseline was -0.4% at 4 years. In the 
placebo group a mean decrease of -0.2% was observed at 4 years.  
Subgroup analyses for the composite of hospitalisation for HF and CV death, the composite of MACE and 
for the renal composite variables showed consistent findings across the subgroups tested.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The trial showed non-inferiority of dapagliflozin to placebo on the primary outcome MACE whereas 
superiority was not shown. However, the point estimate is rather similar as for other products in the class 
albeit that the upper CI was just above 1 (HR (CI)0.93 (0.84, 1.03)). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
DECLARE is included in the RMP for dapagliflozin a Category 3 PASS, in order to further study safety 
concerns identified at the time of the MAA but also identified after the launch of the product. As opposed 
to the studies in the MAA, only selected (non-serious) AEs were collected in addition to SAEs and DAEs. 
Adjudication of important safety variables were performed. 
The DECLARE study provides long-term exposure data with more than 4 000 patients followed for four 
years and some patients followed up to five years.  
SAEs and AEoSIs were generally balanced between treatment groups. Genital infections, DKA and 
embolic or thrombotic events and marked abnormality in haematocrit or haemoglobin were the only 
AEoSI with a higher reporting in the dapagliflozin groups, whereas renal events, hypoglycaemias and 
Fournier’s gangrene was more commonly reported in the placebo group. 
SAEs were generally well balanced, with less than an 0.2% difference between treatment groups for most 
PTs.  HF and acute kidney injury were somewhat more common in the placebo group. The occurrence of 
death was balanced between groups and in both analysis populations.  
Patients with HF NYHA class I-III, previously not included in the clinical study program, were eligible for 
inclusion in the study. Overall, 1724 patients (10% of the total population) were included in the study. In 
total 56% of patients with HF were in NYHA class II and only 7.3% (125 patients) were in NYHA class III. 
There was no imbalance between treatment groups. The data provided does not raise any safety concerns 
with the use of dapagliflozin in patients with HF (NYHA class I-III) and supports the removal of the 
warning on lack of experience in this patient group from section 4.4.

During the assessment of the original MAA, imbalances in the occurrence of bladder cancer, breast 
cancer, and prostate cancer were observed which led to concerns on that dapagliflozin could carry an 
increased risk of malignancies, although the overall incidence did not differ from comparators. The data 
from DECLARE, which has a considerably longer follow-up (up to 5 years) and includes a large number of 
patients, the overall incidence rates of malignancies did not differ between dapagliflozin and placebo 
(14.32 and 14.52 events per 1000 p-y). The relative risks varied around 1 but CIs were wide and 
included 1 for all types of cancer except bladder cancer (in favour of dapagliflozin) and “Other known site” 
(in favour of placebo). 
In DECLARE, the relative risk of bladder cancer was lower with dapagliflozin than with placebo (HR 0.57 
[95% CI: 0.35, 0.93]), the number of breast cancer cases was similar in both groups (36 (0.4%) vs 35 
(0.4%)) and a higher number of prostate cancer cases were observed in the dapagliflozin group (73 
(1.4% of male patients) vs 63 (1.2% of male patients)). 
In DECLARE, no hepatic events assessed as definite or highly likely to be caused by dapagliflozin was 
observed. 
Evaluation of bone fractures was included in DECLARE as a PAM. In the DECLARE study, the number of 
patients with fractures were balanced between treatment groups (5.3% vs 5.1%).  
AEs suggestive of volume depletion were somewhat more common in the dapagliflozin group in the 
preapproval clinical development program. In DECLARE, the AEs suggestive of volume depletion included 
e.g. hypotension, syncope and shock. These events were balanced between treatment groups (213 
(2.5%) and 207 (2.4%)).  
The clinical consequences of increased haematocrit were evaluated. There was an imbalance between 
treatment groups with a higher reporting of both embolic and thrombotic events (7.9% with dapagliflozin 
and 7.2% with placebo) and the reporting of marked abnormalities in haematocrit or haemoglobin with 
dapagliflozin (2.4%) compared to placebo (0.7%). In patients experiencing both events, there was 
however no clear temporal association between the occurrence of abnormal haematocrit and a 
thromboembolic event.  
Overall the incidence of serious hypersensitivity reactions was lower with dapagliflozin than with placebo 
(15 (0.2%) and 26 (0.3%)), although there were more patients with DAEs of hypersensitivity reactions in 
the dapagliflozin group. 
Non-serious UTIs are a known side effect of dapagliflozin. The results from DECLARE indicated that 
dapagliflozin is associated with UTI DAEs, but there is no evidence that dapagliflozin is associated with an 
increased risk of serious UTIs, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, as there were fewer patients with 
UTI SAEs in the dapagliflozin group (79 (0.9%) and 109 (1.3%)). 
There were more patients with genital infections SAEs/DAEs in the dapagliflozin group compared with the 
placebo group: 76 (0.9%) and 9 (0.1%), respectively, corresponding to event rates of 2.5 and 0.3 events 
per 1000 p-y (OT-SAS). The difference was driven by non-serious DAEs of genital infection, thus the data 
does not indicate that dapagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of serious genital infections.  
There were fewer patients with renal events in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group 
(422 (4.9%) and 526 (6.1%)). The same pattern was observed for acute kidney injury, SAEs and DAEs.   
In DECLARE only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. These events were few (58 (0.7%) and 83 
(1.0%), dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively) especially taking the size and duration of the study into 
account. The number of events was lower for dapagliflozin, both in the overall population and in the 
subgroup using insulin or SU.

The data on amputations presented does not indicate any apparent increased risk of amputations with 
dapagliflozin compared to placebo (123 (1.4%) and 113 (1.3%)). It is however noted that there were 
more patients in the dapagliflozin groups who had more than 1 amputation (45 vs 30) and also more 
patients with amputations below and above the knee (46 vs 30). In the subgroup of patients with 
peripheral arterial disease at baseline, more patients in the dapagliflozin groups experienced an 
amputation than in the placebo group (43 and 28 patients, respectively), whereas the opposite was 
observed in patients without peripheral arterial disease at baseline.  
The DECLARE results showed that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation between 
dapagliflozin and DKA in patients with T2DM, although DKA events were rare overall. The clinical 
presentation, risk factors, and contributing factors of DKA events in dapagliflozin-treated patients are 
similar to what is generally observed for DKA events. As observed for the T1DM population, the events 
were evenly distributed over time.   
Events of pancreatitis were also collected. There was no difference in the number or type of events 
between treatment groups (24 (0.3%) with dapagliflozin and 25 (0.3%) with placebo).  
Following the signal of Fournier’s gangrene with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, the DECLARE safety 
database was retrospectively searched for events suggestive of Fournier’s gangrene. There were 18 
patients with events with PTs indicating genital area infections or necrotizing fasciitis: 8 (<0.1%) and 10 
(0.1%) the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Ten of these cases were adjudicated as 
Fournier’s gangrene, out of which 2 were treated with dapagliflozin.  
Apart for the data on haematocrit (see above), there were no remarkable findings with regards to 
laboratory values. As noted in the efficacy part of this report, eGFR was lower in the dapagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group after 1 year whereas eGFR was higher than for placebo after 4 years. Although 
numerically slightly more patients showed increased AST, ALT or total bilirubin levels in the dapagliflozin 
group compared to placebo, this was not reflected as an increase in hepatic events. 
When the safety was assessed by sex, the only apparent difference observed was a higher reporting of 
UTI SAEs in females in both treatment groups and the reporting was lower in the dapagliflozin group than 
in the placebo group. UTI DAEs were more common in the dapagliflozin groups than in the placebo 
groups and more common in females than in males. 
DECLARE included 1092 patients 75 years of age out of which 537 were treated with dapagliflozin. The 
overall reporting of SAEs and AEoSIs was about twice as high in the population 75 years of age 
compared to the overall population, but the reporting was balanced between groups. The overall safety 
profile was comparable to that of the overall population.  
Effect of renal function on the safety profile was also evaluated. Apart from events suggestive of volume 
depletion, that were more common in patients with eGFR <60 treated with dapagliflozin than in those on 
placebo, there were no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with declining renal function.  
AEs suggestive of volume depletion, renal events and amputations were analysed by extrinsic factors, 
such as use of ACEi/ARB and loop diuretics at baseline. These analyses could not identify any influence on 
these events by the extrinsic factors tested. 
There were somewhat more patients with DAEs in the dapagliflozin group (8.1%) than in the placebo 
group (6.9%). Among the most common DAEs the largest numerical imbalance was observed for UTI, 
Balanoposthitis, and Pollakiuria which were more common in the dapagliflozin group. Numerically more 
patients on placebo reported DAEs Bladder cancer or Acute kidney injury.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although the data concerning events suggestive of volume depletion appear reassuring they are not 
considered sufficient to remove warnings regarding the risk of volume depletion on an individual basis. 
Volume depletion should also be considered in relation to the data on haematocrit and thromboembolic 
events. An association cannot be entirely ruled out and since the change in haematocrit is most likely due 
to volume depletion, this is still considered to be a risk with dapagliflozin treatment, especially in 
vulnerable patients. 
Data on amputations was collected throughout the course of the study. The data provided does not 
indicate an increased risk of amputations with dapagliflozin use (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.82, 1.37). However, 
due to the observations made for another SGLT2i, as well as the known diuretic effect of dapagliflozin 
that may jeopardise the microcirculation, the class warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC should remain.  
The data provided does not indicate an increased risk of Fournier’s gangrene with dapagliflozin treatment, 
although it should be taken into account that data was retrospectively collected in a database where only 
SAEs were routinely reported.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
DECLARE was a well-designed and well-conducted trial, conducted to investigate the impact of 
dapagliflozin treatment on CV risk in patients with T2DM. The trial showed non-inferiority of dapagliflozin 
to placebo on the primary outcome MACE whereas superiority was not shown. However, the point 
estimate is rather similar as for other products in the class albeit that the upper CI was just above 1.  
One difference compared to other CVOTs, e.g. the EMPA-REG study, is the higher proportion of patients 
without established CV disease included in the DECLARE study; 59% compared to 0.5% in EMPA-REG. 
Thus, the study population of DECLARE is reflecting a broader population with T2DM.  
A statistically significant lower risk of hospitalisations due to HF compared to placebo was observed, 
whereas no difference compared to placebo could be shown on CV death or all-cause mortality. A lower 
risk (of the same magnitude) of hospitalisation for HF has also been documented for other products in the 
class and is not unexpected considering the diuretic effect. The majority (90%) of the included patients in 
DECLARE did not have HF at the time of inclusion in the study and the data is therefore mainly relevant 
for patients without HF. The relative risk reduction for hospitalisation due to HF was 27% while the 
absolute reduction was only 0.8%.  
The impact on renal events was investigated and the data indicate that progression of nephropathy was 
slower in the dapagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. Thus, the data provided give no 
indication of a negative effect on renal function. Similar results with respect to renal events were seen in 
the EMPA-REG study. It should be noted that even if the incidence of renal events was lower in the 
dapagliflozin group (relative risk reduction 24%, absolute risk reduction 1.3%) compared to placebo, 
there was still a mean reduction in eGFR during the study also in the dapa-group.  
The MAH originally proposed to update the indication to include “prevention of new or worsening HF or CV 
death” and “prevention of new or worsening nephropathy” in the indication wording. This was not 
accepted by the CHMP and the MAH withdrew this proposal for SmPC section 4.1. The data from DECLARE 
on HF, other CV outcomes and nephropathy are of interest for the prescribers and are reflected in section 
5.1 of the SmPC.  In consistency with previous procedures on outcome studies with SGLT-2 inhibitors, a 
cross-reference to study results on cardiovascular events has been added in SmPC 4.1.  With regards to 
the indication as initially claimed by the MAH, the CHMP is of the view that the patient population eligible 
for treatment with dapagliflozin should be mentioned, i.e. patients with T2DM, without mentioning any 
goal of treatment, i.e. neither improvement of glycaemic control, nor prevention of clinical outcomes. This 
means that the wording of the indication will refer to the patient population for whom treatment with 
dapagliflozin is intended, i.e. patients with T2DM, and the information on the DECLARE study, will be 
included in section 5.1. The CHMP considers both improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of 
other outcomes such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality an integral part of the treatment of T2DM, 
which could best be expressed in a single indication for the treatment of T2DM. Therefore, separate 
prevention indications were not considered approvable. However, the CHMP considered the strengthening 
of the wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC by deleting “improvement of glycaemic 
control” from section 4.1 of the SmPC (as this restriction does no longer adequately reflect the 
demonstrated effects for dapagliflozin) together with the description of the benefits with dapagliflozin 
regarding microvascular events and heart failure, as assessed in this application, in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. The wording “treatment of T2DM” is considered more relevant as it encompasses both glycaemic 
control and results on clinical outcomes.

The DECLARE study provides long-term data in a large number of patients treated with dapagliflozin and 
was designed to address a number of safety concerns raised in the assessment of the documentation for 
the MAA. No new safety concerns arise from the data provided.  
The study included a substantial number of elderly subjects (75 years of age) with no indication of a 
different safety profile compared to placebo, supporting the proposed changes to the SmPC for this 
population. Relevant numbers of patients with HF (NYHA Class I-III) were also included. The data 
provided does not raise any safety concerns with the use of dapagliflozin in patients with HF (NYHA class 
I-III) and supports the removal of the warning on lack of experience in this patient group from section 
4.4. 
Data have also been provided on the following safety concerns listed in the RMP: volume depletion, 
clinical consequences of increased haematocrit, bone fracture, serious hypersensitivity reactions and 
pancreatitis, and for which no other PhV activities than DECLARE are ongoing. In addition, data on 
malignancies and specifically bladder cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer was provided.  
Although 3 to 5 years of exposure is not sufficient to completely rule out a cancerogenic effect, no 
imbalance was observed in the overall incidence in the original studies and there are no non-clinical 
findings suggestive of a genotoxic effect of dapagliflozin. The additional data obtained with DECLARE does 
not support the imbalance in e.g. bladder cancer documented in the data supporting the MAA. 
Concerning volume depletion and clinical consequences of increased haematocrit, there are still 
uncertainties with regards to the risk with dapagliflozin use, but the SmPC contains adequate information. 
This also relates to the potential risk of amputations. 
The data from DECLARE is considered sufficient to conclude that dapagliflozin treatment is not associated 
with an increased risk of bone fracture, serious hypersensitivity reactions or pancreatitis. 
The safety information of the SmPC has been updated based on the submitted data.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The DECLARE study provides important information concerning the long-term safety of dapagliflozin as 
well as the effect on cardiovascular and renal outcomes. The indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC has 
been modified to reflect the glycaemic and CV benefits of dapagliflozin by removing the reference to the 
surrogate goal “to improve glycaemic control” and by inserting a cross reference to the results of the 
DECLARE study presented in section 5.1  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of dapagliflozin is positive.

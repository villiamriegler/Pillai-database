2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI) deficiency, also known as alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, is inherited as an 
autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene encoding A1-PI with more than 150 
different genetic variants recognized. The most common deficiency alleles in North Europe are PI Z and PI S, and 
the majority of individuals with severe A1-PI deficiency are PI type ZZ. 
The prevalence in Western Europe and in the USA is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,500-5, 000 (0.04-0.02%) 
in newborns, and is highly dependent on the Scandinavian descent within the population. 
The diagnosis can be established by detection of low serum levels of A1-PI and isoelectric focusing (Fregonese, 
Stolk 2008). This serious and life-threatening, chronic pulmonary disease often becomes clinically apparent by 
the third to fourth decade of life, and usually progresses to severe respiratory insufficiency and premature 
death. 
The clinical manifestations may widely vary between patients, and are pulmonary emphysema, liver cirrhosis 
and, rarely, as the skin disease panniculitis, and is characterized by low serum levels of A1-PI, the main protease 
inhibitor (PI) in human serum. 
Type ZZ and SZ A1-PI deficiency are risk factors for the development of respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, 
coughing), early onset emphysema, and airflow obstruction early in adult life. Environmental factors such as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 10/102 
 
  
  
cigarette smoking, and dust exposure are additional risk factors and have been linked to an accelerated 
progression of this condition. 
The pathogenesis of emphysema is understood to evolve as described in the “protease-antiprotease imbalance” 
model (Gadek 1990). A1-PI is considered to be the primary antiprotease in the lower respiratory tract, where it 
inhibits neutrophil elastase (NE) produced by activated neutrophils (Gadek 1981). Normal healthy individuals 
produce sufficient A1-PI to control NE activity and are thus able to prevent inappropriate proteolysis of lung 
tissue by NE and the subsequent development of emphysema. Conditions that increase neutrophil accumulation 
and activation in the lung, such as respiratory infection and smoking, in turn increase pulmonary levels of NE. 
Individuals who are severely deficient in endogenous A1-PI are unable to maintain an appropriate antiprotease 
defence and are thereby subject to more rapid proteolysis of the alveolar walls, leading to chronic lung disease 
(emphysema). Although more than 150 allelic variants of the Pi genotype have been identified, more than 95% 
of all patients with severe emphysema caused by A1-PI deficiency have the PiZZ genotype (DeMeo 2004).

The most direct therapeutic approach for A1-PI deficiency in patients with emphysema is to replace the missing 
protease inhibitor, thus re-establishing anti-NE protection of the lower respiratory tract. 
Individuals with low endogenous serum A1-PI concentrations, below 11 µM, generally manifest a significantly 
increased risk for development of emphysema above the general population background risk (Eriksson 1964, 
Eriksson 1965, Gadek 1983, WHO 1996). 
A1-PI is a glycoprotein produced by hepatocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. A1-PI acts as the primary 
inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the lower respiratory tract. Neutrophil elastase is a protease capable of 
destroying alveolar walls in the lower respiratory tract (Wewers 1987). It is produced and secreted by activated 
neutrophils, and is primarily found in the alveolar and bronchial lumina. If NE is present in the lung and not 
regulated by its naturally occurring inhibitor A1-PI, as is the case in A1 PI deficiency, NE can cause excessive 
inflammation and proteolysis of alveolar tissue, leading to progressive emphysema. 
Replacement of the missing protease inhibitor is thought to be the most direct approach to therapy by 
re-establishing the protease/anti-protease balance in the lower respiratory tract. This is thought to prevent 
unopposed destruction of lung tissue and thus slow down emphysema progression.

Purified human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI) concentrate has been used for almost 2 decades for A1-PI 
augmentation therapy in individuals who have a reduced level or absence of functional A1-PI and a clinical 
evident lung disease. A target of achieving A1-PI serum concentrations above the 11 µM threshold has been the 
concept of biochemical efficacy in clinical studies of A1-PI augmentation therapies and thought to provide 
therapeutically relevant anti-NE protection in the lung (Crystal 1990). 
Knowledge of comparative outcomes in different disease subtypes remains limited due to the rarity of diagnosis 
and variability in other risk factors such as smoking. 
No clinical guideline or core SmPC exist for alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor products. No prospective studies have 
addressed optimal treatment levels of A1-PI in plasma for different genetic variants. There are also no 
prospective studies that have determined whether additional incremental clinical benefits may be achieved at a 
population level with treatment to A1-PI concentrations above 11 µM (50 mg/dL) when measured by 
immunonephelometry (or 80 mg/dl when measured by radial immunodiffusion), although the epidemiologic 
evidence suggests this possibility based on the decreasing risk of emphysema and the increasing A1-PI 
concentrations in patients with ZZ, SZ, MZ, and MM genotypes. With the lack of such evidence, the 11 µM 
threshold is still often seen as the concentration to be achieved with augmentation therapy.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The general information about the nomenclature, structure and biochemical characteristics of the active 
substance is considered adequate. 
Briefly, human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) is a 394 amino acid protein which circulates in plasma and 
belongs to the Serpin protein family. Sufficient information on secondary and tertiary structure has been 
provided. The average molecular weight of A1PI cited in the literature varies considerably from 49 to 59 kDa, 
depending on the methodology used. Most values center around 50 – 52 kDa. 
In addition to three N- linked glycosylations at positions 46, 83, and 247, the A1PI molecule may contain other 
potential modifications. Amino acid side chain modifications may include methionine oxidation and asparagines 
deamidation. Oxidation of two methionines in particular, residues 351 and 358 located in the reactive center 
loop, are known to have functional implications for the molecule. Proteolytic cleavage of the five N-terminal 
residues and the C-terminal lysine have also been reported. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturer  
See above section 1.2. 
Description of manufacturing process and in-process controls  
The active substance manufacturing process has been sufficiently described, flow charts have been provided and 
the batch scale has been defined.  
In summary, the active substance is manufactured from pooled human plasma through to the sterile bulk in a 
continuous process. There are two main manufacturing stages: (1) modified Cohn fractionation to obtain 
Fraction IV1 Precipitate from the plasma pool and (2) subsequent purification of the active substance from 
Fraction IV1 Precipitate. Two dedicated virus inactivation/elimination steps are included in the later 
manufacturing stage.  
Plasma pooling and fractionation 
Fraction IV1 Precipitate, from which the active substance is purified, is isolated from pooled human plasma using 
a modified Cohn ethanol fractionation process. In the first step, separation of the cryoprecipitate from the 
plasma pool is accomplished by temperature control and centrifugation. Subsequently, two alternative optional 
steps for the removal of the Prothrombin Complex by physical adsorption to a resin are possible. In the following 
steps, the fractionation process employs the technique of precipitation of specific plasma proteins at defined pH, 
temperature and alcohol concentrations followed by filtration for separation of the precipitates to obtain Fraction 
IV1 Precipitate.  
Purification process, starting from Fraction IV1 
The purification process starts with the extraction of A1-PI  from fraction IV1 precipitate, DTT and aerosil 
treatment followed by ion exchange chromatography (IEC) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). 
After ultra/diafiltration the solution is stabilised followed by pasteurisation . The pasteurised solution is 
ultra/diafiltered, and then nanofiltered for virus removal. The nanofiltration eluate is adjusted/diluted and sterile

filtered into a sterile bulk vessel yielding the active substance.  In response to the Day 120 LoQ additional details 
about the manufacturing process were provided and the description updated accordingly. 
Control of materials 
For the human plasma used as starting material for the manufacture of Human Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor 
reference was given to the centrally certified CSL Behring Plasma Master File (EMA/H/PMF/000001/04). 
Relevant information on and evaluation of the collection, testing, storage and transportation of individual 
plasma donations and plasma pool testing are included in the PMF which is yearly updated.  
Compendial and non-compendial ingredients used in the production process of the active substance were listed. 
The ingredients sodium chloride, mannitol, and sodium phosphate (monobasic monohydrate) were identified as 
excipients in the final formulation. Also auxiliary materials and filter materials were listed. Specifications for 
non-compendial and auxiliary materials were provided including also specification details for the HIC material, 
IEC material, nanofilters and sterile filters.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Although the general approach for defining critical steps, critical quality attributes and critical process 
parameters was found reasonable, further justification of process parameters and quality attributes chosen was 
asked for at Day 120. In the response the description of the manufacturing process was updated to include all 
key process parameters (KPP) and general process parameters (GPP). Also further justification about 
limits/ranges for the quality attributes and process parameters proposed was provided and limits of two 
parameters were narrowed. The response was considered acceptable.    
Process validation 
Comprehensive validation data covering the fractionation and the different steps in the purification part of the 
manufacturing process were provided, demonstrating that the process is capable of producing consistently a 
product of the intended quality within the defined process parameters and quality attributes.  
The validation of the fractionation down to Fraction IV1 was one part of the validation of the revised process for 
another product produced by the manufacturer. These validation data were submitted as part of the MAA for 
Respreeza. All acceptance criteria were met. For the pooling and cryoprecipitation steps the results complied 
with established historical/procedural conditions. The two alternative process steps, involving an optional 
removal of the Prothrombin Complex, were both covered by the process validation and the use of the optional 
steps in the very early part of the plasma fractionation process is found acceptable. 
In addition, process validation of the packaging of chromatography columns (IEC; HIC) has been performed. 
Hold time for the intermediates and filtrates were established based on appropriate validation data. Critical and 
key process parameters were adequately defined in the validation and were satisfactorily covered by the 
validation 
A worst-case approach was used for the validation of pasteurization and nanofiltration. 
In conclusion, the commercial active substance manufacturing process has been adequately validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
During development and since licensing of the product in the USA several changes were made to the 
manufacturing process.

The Applicant showed in the development part that the changes introduced to the manufacturing process of 
A1-PI had no detrimental effects on the quality attributes of A1-PI  drug product and that over time comparable 
A1-PI  drug product was manufactured.  
The major process changes for the material used in the clinical and nonclinical studies have been sufficiently 
described. Material manufactured at the commercial plant and with all changes introduced except one , has been 
included in the latest clinical extension study which was still on-going at the time of opinion. An overview on 
batches by lot numbers used in clinical and non-clinical studies and the respective purification process applied 
has been provided. 
In conclusion, the changes introduced during the development of the current proposed process were adequately 
addressed and in general satisfactorily justified. Comprehensive comparability studies including relevant test 
attributes have been performed and the results demonstrate acceptable comparability to the process previously 
used. Material manufactured throughout the different process changes has been included in clinical trials.   
Characterisation 
The structure of A1-PI was characterised in detail with respect to isoforms, post translational modifications, 
aggregates and C-terminal and N-terminal truncations as well as secondary structure/tertiary structure. Process 
related impurities were identified  which were present in low mM concentrations or below the detection limit of 
the method of analysis. According to the provided reference these concentrations were far below any toxic 
effect. It is considered acceptable not to test every batch for these impurities because they are removed during 
manufacture, e.g. diafiltration steps. 
Specification 
The sterile bulk has been defined as the active substance. Although a sterile bulk is normally not defined as the 
active substance, the structure of this dossier was accepted. Considering that no other steps than filling of the 
sterile bulk into vials and lyophilisation is used for the further manufacture to obtain the drug product,  this 
control strategy is found acceptable.  
The active substance specification includes one additional control parameter. For the control of other quality 
attributes, reference is made to the drug product specification. In response to the Day 120 LoQ the specification 
limit for the additional control parameter was slightly tightened and an action limit was established based on a 
statistical evaluation of historical data. In addition, the specification was updated accordingly. 
Analytical procedures 
A brief summary of the analytical procedures used to test the sterile bulk were provided. Two alternative test 
methods for bacterial endotoxins (Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Gel-clot assay and kinetic turbidimetric 
method) are used and have been acceptably validated. These analytical procedures are performed according to 
European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) methodology.  
Batch analysis 
Results from three batches were provided demonstrating results meeting the active substance specification. 
Reference standard 
For the potency assay an A1-PI in-house standard preparation is used. The same material is used for drug 
product control testing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 15/102 
 
  
  
In the beginning, CSL Behring used an in-house preparation which was calibrated based on its inhibition of a 
titrated trypsin preparation. When the 1st International Standard for A1-PI (plasma derived, NIBSC code: 
05/162) became available CSL Behring calibrated the in-house lot L426403 against this standard for use in 
potency testing of in-process samples and finished product. To keep equivalence between the two 
methodologies and consistency in A1PI product a correction factor was used. Further information about the 
assignment of the correction factor was requested in the Day 120 LoQ. It was responded that a mean difference 
of 8.9% had been observed upon testing of twenty finished product lots using both the old (Y400106) and the 
new (L426403) in-house standards. Subsequently, a correction factor of 8.9% was established to assign 
potency of the new standard and to maintain the same patient dose as what was administered during the pivotal 
clinical trial.  
Also in future, any new Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor Potency Standard, used for final product potency 
determination will be calibrated against the current WHO Standard with the 8.9% correction factor applied. This 
approach, using a correction factor when assigning the potency of a new reference standard calibrated against 
the International WHO standard, can be agreed to. The policy for the establishment of a new reference standard 
and the calibration in case of a change of the international standard, as well as the criteria for acceptance of 
obtained values, has been acceptably described.  
Stability 
The manufacturing process for A1PI is a continuous process thus stability studies for the active substance were 
not part of the CSL Behring stability program. The hold time for the active substance sterile bulk has been 
acceptably justified. At least 3 batches underwent the respective hold (or cumulative holds) and the hold time 
was set based on the shortest hold times applied. No formal hold time studies were performed which is 
considered acceptable.

The data presented on pharmaceutical development is considered satisfactory. The development strategy of the 
final formulation was based on the Applicant’s own experience with products already manufactured by the 
Company as well as information obtained from a competitor’s A1PI(H) product.  
The same formulation was used in A1-PI manufacturing for all preclinical toxicity studies and all clinical trials. 
The aseptic filling operation did not undergo any major process changes from production of the early clinical lots 
of A1-PI. The lyophilisation has been qualified for the current process in two lyophilisers. The lyophilisation cycle 
parameters, as described in the dossier, have remained the same throughout all qualification activities. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer  
See above section 1.2. 
Description of manufacturing process, in-process controls and validation  
The manufacturing process covers aseptic filling of the drug product, lyophilisation, stoppering and sealing of 
the vial. After vial inspection unlabelled vials are shipped to CSL Behring Marburg for secondary packaging and 
labelling. Based on the control test at CSL Behring, Marburg and the OMCL batch release the batch is released 
by the Qualified Person to the EU/EEA market. 
On request, the description of the drug product manufacturing process has been revised and is now considered 
acceptable. The batch formula was provided. Process parameters and quality attributes and the corresponding 
process controls have been clearly described and are deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring the 
manufacturing process. 
Acceptance criteria and data for media fills were given and comply with the requirements in the EU Guidelines to 
Good Manufacturing Practice Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use, Vol 1, Annex 1. 
Criticality of process parameters/quality attributes was assessed and it was concluded that there were no critical 
process parameters or critical quality attributes for the formulation and lyophilisation steps. 
Process validation 
The drug product manufacturing process is considered properly validated. Process simulations of aseptic filling 
were performed at a minimum of every three months on each active filling line and every six months on each 
active lyophiliser. Process simulations were performed utilizing the same equipment and personnel qualified for 
routine production. The lyophilisation process was evaluated in depth showing batch homogeneity within a 
lyophilser from tray to tray and within a tray. 
Media fills were routinely performed for the aseptic filing step and the lyophilisation. The provided data 
demonstrates acceptable maintenance of sterility during the aseptic filling procedure and lyophilisation.

The transport validation provided for the drug product from the site in Kankakee to the Marburg site verified that 
the temperature is maintained at the temperature range of 2 to 25ºC. 
Control of excipients 
The excipients used in the formulation comply with Ph Eur requirements. They are common excipients used in 
marketed parenteral pharmaceutical products. No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the 
manufacture of the drug product. The specification for each of the excipient was provided.  
Product specification 
The drug product specifications were considered, in principle, in compliance with the Ph. Eur. monograph for 
Human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor.  For chosen alternative test methods acceptable correlations to the 
methods referred to in the monograph were demonstrated.  
During the evaluation procedure further justification of the specifications limits has been provided. Release and 
end-of-shelf life specifications for molecular size distribution and protein profile/purity have been introduced 
based on data from clinical trial batches and stability studies. Lower shelf life limits proposed for molecular size 
distribution and protein profile/purity were found acceptable considering the demonstrated good consistency 
between batches both at release and between batches included in the different stability studies. In conclusion, 
the revised specification limits were found acceptably justified. 
Analytical methods 
Acceptable descriptions of all analytical methods were provided in the dossier, also for the methods with 
reference to Ph. Eur. Although the compendial test methods were very briefly described this was found 
acceptable for these methods covered by the Ph. Eur.  
Validation data have been submitted for all methods, also for compendial test methods. The results complied 
with the acceptance criteria and the methods were found suitable for the intended use. At D120 additional data 
was requested for a few test methods to demonstrate that they can be considered comparable to the PhEur 
methods and the response was considered satisfactorily. 
The Applicant applied for approval of an alternative method to the Ph. Eur. pyrogen test for batch release. After 
submission of additional information the use of the alternative method was considered approvable. 
For the A1-PI potency assay an in-house method is used which is similar to the method given in the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. The in-house potency assay was found acceptably validated and the results demonstrated an 
acceptable comparability to the method given in the monograph. As requested the applicant resolved questions 
on the statistical evaluation of results obtained with the in-house potency assay and subsequently, the assay 
was considered approvable for bath release.    
Batch analysis 
The batch analysis data presented for the 3 commercial final container batches (pasteurized in glass bottles) 
complied well with the limits in the proposed drug product specification and demonstrated a satisfactory batch 
to batch consistency.

Container Closure System 
Information provided on the container closure system is found sufficient. Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human) 
is aseptically filled into 50 ml Type I glass vials, stoppered with a 20 mm bromobutyl rubber closure and sealed 
with a 20 mm aluminum body flipcap seal with a polypropylene flip-off cap. The vial and closure were in 
compliance with PhEur. monographs. Relevant specifications were provided, which also included drawings.  
Stability of the product 
The submitted real time/real temperature stability data support the shelf life claim in the SmPC.  
Real time /real temperature stability data as well as data from accelerated studies were provided to support the 
shelf life claim. Therefore, the claimed shelf-life is found acceptably justified. Furthermore, stability after 
reconstitution was claimed. In the response to the day 120 LoQ, results acceptably justifying the proposed 
in-use time and temperature have been provided.  
Adventitious agents 
Non-Viral Adventitious Agents 
Prions 
No material of animal origin is used in the manufacture of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and therefore the 
TSE risk is only related to the use of human plasma as starting material. 
In the summary report and in the adventitious agent safety assessment report, the Applicant has thoroughly 
described all measures taken to minimize the risk of transmitting vCJD with this medicinal product.  
The risk to transmit prions, by the application of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is significantly reduced due 
to careful selection of donors (i.e. exclusive use of plasma sourced according to the centrally certified CSL 
Behring Plasma Master File (PMF; EMA/H/PMF/000001/04). In addition, only a very low prion load in human 
plasma – if any – can be assumed based on studies with laboratory animals. Furthermore, the removal of prions 
(if present in the plasma pool) by selected steps of the manufacturing process of plasma derivatives was shown 
in investigational studies. Results from spiking experiments investigating the capacity of the manufacturing 
process to reduce prions have been provided. This investigation has been performed with another medical 
product, A1-PI (Human) Inhalation Solution. In the response to day 120 LOQ the applicant explained that the 
manufacturing steps investigated for prion removal were identical for A1-PI (Respreeza) and A1-PI (Human) 
Inhalation Solution. The provided studies are therefore applicable also for A1-PI (Respreeza).  
Furthermore, data has also been provided that demonstrates that the routine cleaning procedures implemented 
in the manufacturing process to sanitise equipment and material utilising alkaline solutions effectively remove / 
inactivate prions and therefore a potential cross-contamination by prions to subsequently produced batches can 
be excluded.  
Taken into consideration the low prion load in plasma, the epidemiological situation of vCJD in the donor 
population, the amount of plasma used to produce one dose of final product, and the prion reduction capacity of 
the overall manufacturing process, the risk that Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor will transmit TSEs seems 
remote.

Viral Adventitious Agents 
Measures taken to reduce the risk of viral contamination of Respreeza include three principal complimentary 
approaches ((1) donor selection and testing of single donations and minipools for viral markers; (2) testing of 
plasma pools for viral markers; (3) inclusion of virus inactivation and/or removal steps in the active substance  
manufacturing process). 
A1-PI (H) is produced from human plasma collected in the USA. The overall viral safety strategy includes 
selection of qualified donors, a deferral policy and a look-back procedure. Single donations are screened by an 
adequate testing program for viral markers (anti-HIV-1/2, HBsAg, anti-HCV) and by NAT for HAV, HBV, HCV, 
HIV-1 and high titers of B19V at a minipool level. The plasma pool is also tested for anti-HIV-1/2 and HBsAg and 
by NAT for HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV-1 and high titers of B19V (limit: less than 104 IU B19V DNA per ml). The donor 
selection and donation/plasma testing strategy for viral markers is considered adequate. 
Adequate virus validation studies have been performed to evaluate selected manufacturing steps, 
pasteurisation and virus filtration, for their capacity to inactivate or remove various viruses. Experiments were 
performed on a validated scaled down version of the manufacturing process both at standard conditions and 
worst case conditions to demonstrate robustness of virus reduction. Detailed validation reports (one for each 
virus tested) have been provided. 
For the calculation of the overall reduction factor, the highest reduction factor of the individual step was used by 
the Applicant when in all experiments no residual virus infectivity could be detected (complete virus 
inactivation). If at least one experiment for an individual step resulted in residual virus infectivity, the mean 
virus reduction factor of all these experiments was calculated.  It is, however, considered appropriate to take the 
mean values from the replicate runs.  
An estimate of virus particles in the finished product was submitted by the Applicant in the initial MAA as outlined 
in chapter 9 of Guideline on plasma-derived medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/BWP/706271/2010). In this risk 
assessment, the Applicant assumed that only one of 1000 B19V genomes would represent an infectious virus 
particle. This assumption was made based on cell culture data. However, guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/706271/2010 (Chapter 9.2) outlines that in-vitro data were not acceptable and that a 
conservative approach using virus genomes should be taken. Therefore a revised risk assessment was 
performed by the assessor.  
Based on the revised risk assessment it was concluded at D120 that the applicant should validate additional 
manufacturing steps for reduction of parvovirus B19 in order to maintain the proposed safety claim in the SmPC. 
Otherwise a precautionary warning statement for parvovirus B19 should be introduced in the SmPC section 4.4. 
With the response to the D120 LoQ, the Applicant provided additional virus validation data on parvovirus B19 
removal by fractionation steps in the upstream manufacturing process demonstrating additional reduction of 
parvovirus B19. The additional data contributes to demonstrate sufficient safety margin for B19 to support the 
Applicant’s statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC that the measures taken are considered effective for parvovirus 
B19. 
Furthermore, data has also been provided demonstrating that any virus potentially retained in the production 
system would be adequately removed and/or inactivated prior to re-use of the system, e.g., by sanitisation of 
equipment and material.  
Taken together, safety with regard to enveloped and non-enveloped viruses has been demonstrated in 
compliance with the relevant CHMP guidelines.

Drug product (solvent) 
In the presentation of the finished medicinal product one vial containing 20 ml Water for Injections (WFI) is 
supplied to be used for the reconstitution of the powder. 
Pharmaceutical Development  
The pharmaceutical development of the WFI solvent has been sufficiently described and addressed. 
Manufacture 
The manufacturer of the WFI is listed in section 1.2 of this report. 
Water for Injections in bulk is produced by a distillation process. Starting material for the final product Water for 
Injections is Potable Water which is processed to Purified Water by reverse osmosis. After distillation of Purified 
Water, the Water for Injections in bulk is filled automatically into depyrogenised containers. Immediately after 
filling the containers are automatically stoppered, sealed and sterilised prior to release testing. 
Two different steam sterilisers can be used for the sterilisation process of the filled final WFI containers. The 
sterilisation is performed according to an automated sterilisation program, which is used for both steam 
sterilisers. The qualification documents confirmed the effective sterilisation process of the filled WFI final 
containers. 
The information provided in the dossier for manufacturing of Water for injections is considered sufficient to 
conclude that the WFI is manufactured under GMP compliant conditions in a fully validated process. 
Control of drug product 
The product specification and the choice of routine tests were mostly based on the Ph. Eur. monograph "Water 
for Injections” or equivalent to the monograph. However, some additional tests (Carbon dioxide, TOC and pH) 
were performed according to USP in long term stability studies. This is acceptable. 
All relevant information addressing the control of WFI solvent has been provided. 
Container closure 
The container closure components consist of a 25 ml glass vial (Ph. Eur. type I) and a gray infusion stoppers 
made of chlorobutyl rubber. The stopper is free of latex. They are sealed with crimp caps consisting of a colored 
plastic disc made of polypropylene and an aluminum cap. 
The container closure system for WFI solvent is sufficiently described.  
Stability 
Formal  stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines.  The  performed  analytical 
methods and the respective specifications were according to Ph. Eur.  
Stability data in support of the shelf-life claim and storage conditions for Water for Injections were submitted 
covering  long-term  storage  and  accelerated  storage.  All  stability  lots  reported  meet  the  specification  of  all 
parameters under all conditions applied. The presented stability data from all stability studies are considered 
sufficient to justify the claimed shelf life.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant submitted a full dossier for the product Respreeza (human Alpha1-proteinase Inhibitor (A1-PI)). 
The dossier is in general of good quality and no major issues were identified in the submitted documentation on 
quality during the evaluation procedure.  
In summary, the manufacture of the A1-PI active substance and drug product lead in a validated manufacturing 
process  to  A1-PI  drug  product  of  consistent  batch-to-batch  quality  complying  with  the  monograph  “human 
á-1-proteinase inhibitor (2387)”. The quality of the active substance and drug product is controlled by adequate 
test methods and specifications. Safety with regard to transmissible agents, such as human TSE and enveloped 
and non-enveloped viruses has been demonstrated in compliance with the relevant CHMP guidelines. 
From a quality point of view the product is recommended for approval. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All toxicology and local tolerance studies conducted with Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor CSL Behring GmbH 
(studies No CPG 006/982668/AC, CPG 005/982664/AC, DS 94-053, DS 94-059, CHV 656-193, DS 94-114, CPG 
009/982936,  CPG  007/982329/SE,  CPG  008/982330/SE),  as  well  as  the  safety  pharmacology  study 
(CPG010/983098),  were  performed  in  accordance  with  good  laboratory  practice  (GLP).  The  neoantigenicity 
study (SR 98-014), was not performed under GLP but rather under “GLP-like” conditions. Two pharmacology in 
vitro studies (BD#158-95-07, SR-71r) were not conducted according to GLP. The CHMP is of the view that the 
absence of GLP compliance does not affect the conclusions that can be drawn from these two studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamic effect of A1-PI(H) was demonstrated in vitro by inhibition of its target enzyme, elastase. 
No in vivo pharmacology studies have been performed. 
The Applicant has performed a literature review, citing studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs with 
human A1-PI. In summary, these studies provide support for the notion that human A1-PI is pharmacologically 
active in mice, rats and rabbits. With regard to dogs, a few studies have been conducted where human A1-PI has 
been administered via inhalation. Lung lavage fluid obtained from dogs after inhalation of human A1-PI aerosols 
demonstrated an increase in inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic elastase, in proportion to the presence 
of human Al-PI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 22/102 
 
  
  
The short-term pharmacodynamic activity of aerosolized Prolastin for treatment of pulmonary  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa infection associated with acquired A1-PI deficiency has been demonstrated in a rat model (Cantin 
and Woods, 1999). A similar short-term study could have been conducted with A1-PI(H) in the pallid mouse 
model,  not  only  to  show  proof  of  principle  but  also  to  obtain  valuable  information  on  pharmacokinetic 
parameters. 
The lack of in vivo pharmacology studies is considered acceptable by the CHMP since human plasma-derived 
A1-PI has a well-established physiologic effect in humans. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed because no other pharmacodynamic effects are 
expected. This is regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A safety pharmacology study has been performed in anaesthetized dogs. The results showed that intravenous 
administration of A1-PI(H) at 60 or 240 mg/kg bw (corresponding to estimated human equivalent doses of 33.3 
mg/kg and 133.3 mg/kg, respectively) had no effect on ECG, arterial blood pressure, heart rate,  contractile 
status of the myocardium, or respiratory parameters in any of the animals. A slight increase in femoral blood 
flow and concurrent decrease in femoral resistance were observed in the three dogs that received A1-PI(H) at 
240 mg/kg bw. There were no consistent changes in blood biochemistry, haematology or blood gas parameters 
that could be related to treatment with A1-PI(H) at either dose level. The NOAEL in this study was 60 mg/kg, 
based on the slight effects on femoral blood flow and resistance after administration of 240 mg/kg bw. The 
NOAEL  is  approximately  0.6x  the  intended  clinical  dose,  after  conversion  of  the  dose  in  dogs  to  human 
equivalent dose.  
In vitro electrophysiology studies to assess the potential for delayed ventricular repolarization (e.g. hERG assay) 
have  not  been  conducted  with  A1-PI(H).  No  justification  for  the  absence  of  such  studies  has  been  given. 
However, it is considered unlikely that A1-PI(H) would block the potassium channel of hERG, since the relatively 
small pore size would exclude access to proteins the size of A1-PI(H). 
No safety pharmacology study has been conducted to evaluate effects on the central nervous system. In view of 
the nature of the product this is considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  This  is  regarded  as  acceptable  by  the 
CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  (absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion)  in  animals  have  not  been 
performed with A1-PI(H) due to interference of elimination kinetics with immune reactions directed against the 
human heterologous protein and as PK data obtained with human proteins in animals are not representative for 
the situation in man. The lack of PK studies is regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. The pharmacokinetics of 
A1-PI(H) is known from clinical studies with the competitor product. The half-life of about 5 days has also been 
confirmed  for  A1-PI(H).  Furthermore,  A1-PI(H)  is  a  naturally  occurring  human  plasma  protein  which  will 
undergo the physiological catabolic processes of endogenous proteins which are well defined.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity study no. CPG 006/982668/AC: Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (human) acute intravenous 
toxicity to the mouse 
Three groups of ten mice (5 males/5 females) received a single intravenous injection of API at the ascending 
dose of levels of 60, 240 and 600 mg/kg body weight. A further group has been similarly treated with API 
placebo. After 14 days of observation all animals were sacrificed as scheduled at study termination day 15. 
Clinical signs were confined to transient piloerection in all dose groups and temporarily increased respiration 
within the high dose group. There were no other treatment related effects observed. The NOAEL is 240 mg/kg 
body weight, the acute lethal intravenous dose to mice was shown to be greater than 600 mg/kg body weight.  
Single dose toxicity study no. CPG 005/982664/AC: Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (human) actute intravenous 
toxicity to the rat 
4 groups of 10 rats (5 male/5 female) were treated intravenously by a single dose of API placebo, 60, 240 and 
600 mgAPI/kg body weight. The results of this study demonstrated that transitory clinical signs (piloerection) 
were confined to the high dose group. There were no other evidence of systemic response to treatment. The 
acute lethal intravenous dose to rats was demonstrated to be greater than 600mg/kg body weight.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
As proteins of human origin are immunogenic to animals, long-term administration of CE1226 to animals would 
not generate useful data. Repeat dose toxicity testing was therefore restricted to five daily doses in rats and 
rabbits. 
Repeat dose toxicity study no. DS 94-053: 5-day intravenous toxicity study of Alpha1-Antitrypsin in rats  
60 HSD:Sprague Dawley rats (30males/30females) were used to assess the intravenous toxicity of 60 and 240 
mg API/kg when administered once daily for 5 consecutive days. 10 animals per sex were used for the control 
group (API placebo) and the both treatment groups. The dosing volume was 1.37 ml/kg for the 60 mg/kg/day 
group and 5.50 ml/kg/day for the control and the 240 mg/kg/day group. The results of this study demonstrated 
that i.v. administration of API at 240 mg/kg/day to male and female rats was associated with decreases in some 
blood chemistry parameters (e.g. triglycerides, total protein, albumin, albumin/globulin ratio). The changes in 
blood chemistry parameters were within the historical control range. In addition, increases in the absolute and 
relative splenic weights (females: 17 and 15% higher; males: 12 and 11% higher) were observed in the high 
dose group; however, these changes were not associated with pathological modifications. There were no 
treatment-related clinical signs recorded during the study. No modifications have been found in animals 
receiving 60 mg/kg/day. 
Repeat dose toxicity study no. DS 94-059: 5-day intravenous toxicity study of Alpha1-Antitrypsin in rabbits 
Repeated dose toxicity has been investigated in 24 New Zealand White rabbits (12 males, 12 females) when 
administered intravenous 60 and 240 mg API/kg body weight compared to placebo once daily for 5 consecutive 
days. The dosing volume was 1.4 ml/kg/day for the 60 mg/kg/day group and 5.5 ml/kg/day for the control and 
240 mg/kg/day group. There was no mortality nor any clinical signs related to treatment with API. There were 
no treatment related modifications in body weight, food consumption, or haematology and blood chemistry 
parameters. In both treatment groups increases of the mean lung/bronchus weights of both sexes have been 
found, which are regarded to be possibly correlated with the increased incidence and grade of microscopic 
findings in the lungs. Dose-related increases in the incidence and severity of focal inflammatory changes in both

the lung and myocardium have been found in both treatment groups. In addition, mild to moderate increase in 
absolute and relative group mean spleen weight have been found in the high dose group. 
Repeat dose toxicity study no. CHV 656-193: 5-day intravenous toxicity study of Alpha1-Antitrypsin in rabbits 
Due to the findings of the previous study this study was designed to determine the toxicity of API using a 
different source of rabbits and a test article lot with improved impurity profile. 4 female rabbits were dosed with 
API at a dose level of 240.1 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days compared to a control group receiving API placebo. 
Mean absolute and relative spleen weights were significantly increased; in addition, absolute and relative uterus 
and ovary weights were significantly decreased when compared to the control group. Although not statistically 
significant, the thymus weights were slightly lower in the treatment group. All other organ data were generally 
comparable between control and treatment group. No other treatment-related effects have been observed. 
Repeat dose toxicity study no. DS 94-114: 5 day intravenous toxicitiy study of Alpha1-Antitrypsin in rabbits 
24 NZW (SPF) rabbits (12males/12 females) were used to assess the intravenous toxicity of API when 
administered once daily for five consecutive days. 4 animals per sex were used in each group. Rabbits in the 
control group received API vehicle, while the treatment groups were assigned to dosage levels of 60 and 240 
mg/kg/day. The dosing volume was 2.2 ml/kg for the low dose group, 8.7 ml/kg for the high dose group, and 2.2 
or 8.7 ml/kg respectively for the control group. No treatment related clinical signs, effects on body weight, food 
consumption and gross or microscopic observations have been found. The rabbits of the control group of study 
no. DS 94-114 accidentally showed extreme high uterus weights in comparison to the control groups of the 
other studies whereas the uterus weights of the treated animals were in the normal range. 
Repeat dose toxicity study no. CPG 009/982936: Alpha1-Protease Inhibitor (API) Toxicity study by intravenous 
(bolus) administration to rabbits for 5 days 
This study has been conducted to assess the systemic toxicity of API to the rabbit after daily intravenous bolus 
injection for 5 days. Groups of 5 male and 5 female NZW rabbits were intravenously administered 60 or 240 
mg/kg/day, using 1.4 or 5.5 ml/kg respectively. A further group of 10 rabbits (5 per sex) received the vehicle 
only at same volume of 5.5 ml/kg as the high dose group. The results showed no unscheduled deaths or 
treatment correlated clinical signs. No treatment-related effects on haematology, biochemistry have been noted. 
Females and males receiving 240 mg/kg showed increased spleen weights in comparison with controls. 
Genotoxicity 
No studies on the genotoxic potential of A1-PI(H) have been conducted as this is a physiological human plasma 
protein and is not expected to have mutagenic effects. This is regarded as acceptable by the CHMP and is 
reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed, since A1-PI(H) is a naturally occurring human plasma protein 
and no carcinogenic effects in humans are expected. In addition, life-long administration of A1-PI(H) to animals 
is not possible due to the antigenicity of A1-PI(H) for other species. This is regarded as acceptable by the CHMP 
and is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No animal reproduction studies have been conducted with A1-PI(H) and its safety for use in human pregnancy 
has not been established in controlled clinical trials. The CHMP agreed that since human alpha1-proteinase 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 25/102 
 
  
  
inhibitor is an endogenous human protein, it is considered unlikely that A1-PI(H) will cause harm to the foetus 
when given at recommended doses this is reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The excretion of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor in milk has not been studied in animals. This is reflected in 
section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
No animal fertility studies have been conducted with A1-PI(H) and its effect on human fertility has not been 
established in controlled clinical trials. The CHMP agreed that since human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is an 
endogenous human protein, no adverse effects on fertility are expected when given at recommended doses. 
This is reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Toxicokinetic data 
No studies were performed. This is regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance of A1-PI(H) was tested New Zeeland White Rabbit model as a part of the repeat dose study and 
did not produce any treatment related local reactions. 
Other toxicity studies 
Neoantigenicity study no. SR 98-014: A study on the neoantigenicity of pasteurized Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor 
(human) in rabbits 
One lot of A1-PI(H) pasteurized using 3 different conditions was tested for the presence of neoantigens in a 
rabbit model system. The present study was conducted with A1-PI(H) pasteurized under standard operating 
conditions, as well as 2 more extreme pasteurisation conditions .The results of this study reveal no evidence for 
the existence of neoantigens in the A1-PI(H) samples as a result of pasteurization with the 3 conditions used. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids 
are exempted from a detailed environmental risk assessment because they are unlikely to result in a significant 
risk to the environment. A1-PI(H), being a plasma protein, falls within this category of substances and thus no 
further assessment of the environmental risk of A1-PI(H) is needed. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The most relevant animal model is a genetic mouse model, the so-called pallid mouse, which has an inherited 
A1-PI deficiency and develops emphysema spontaneously (Martorana et al., 1993; De Santi et al., 1995). 
Furthermore other animal models with pulmonary damage or emphysema that comprise direct instillation of 
elastase or repeated endotoxin administration to animals with reduced A1-PI levels do not adequately reflect the 
pathophysiology of emphysema due to A1-PI deficiency. 
Since efficacy testing of A1-PI(H) in adequate animal models is hampered by the development of antibodies 
against A1-PI(H) in animals, no in-vivo studies on the pharmacodynamic properties of A1-PI(H) were conducted. 
However, in-vitro pharmacodynamic studies using a neutrophil elastase inhibition assay demonstrate equal 
specific activity of CE1226 as compared to the registered plasma-derived human A1-PI(H) that has already 
proved efficacy in clinical use. Inhibition of elastase activity is thought to be the major beneficial mechanism of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 26/102 
 
  
  
A1-PI(H) augmentation therapy in emphysema patients, thus, in-vitro demonstration of elastase inhibitory 
activity is considered a good parameter for pharmacodynamic efficacy. 
The toxicological program comprises single and repeated dose toxicity tests in several species, and includes 
local tolerance testing and addresses the potential formation of neoantigen due to pasteurization.  
The performed nonclinical experiments revealed no evidence of toxicological findings at the intended clinical 
dose, a good local tolerability and the absence of the formation of neo-epitopes. However, from a non-clinical 
point of view no safety margin can be identified for A1-PI(H). 
The toxicity studies with intravenous administration of A1-PI(H) up to 5 day duration revealed that potential 
target organs for toxicity could be lung, heart, spleen and uterus. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies longer than 5 days, reproductive toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies, have 
not been performed. Such studies are not considered meaningful due to the production of antibodies against the 
heterologous human protein in animals. Since A1-PI(H) is a protein and a physiological constituent of human 
blood, it is not expected to present carcinogenic, genotoxic, or teratogenic effects. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The safety of Respreeza has been assessed in several preclinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal no special risk 
for humans based on safety pharmacology and short term toxicity studies. This is reflected in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC. Since A1-PI(H) is a protein and a physiological constituent of human blood, it is not expected to present 
carcinogenic, genotoxic, or teratogenic effects. No animal reproduction studies have been conducted with 
A1-PI(H). This is reflected in section 4.6 in the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
A GCP inspection performed by the Irish Medicines Board on the 13th to 16th December 2011 identified critical 
and major deficiencies at the Professor McElvaney, Ireland, centre (studies CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001). 
The satisfactory responses to its findings have been provided.  
The final FDA inspection Report regarding compliance with GCP for human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor CSL 
Behring GmbH (Respreeza, aka Zadalfa and Zemaira in US) has been completed and findings breeching GCP 
were found. The GCP-related FDA inspection findings were related to treatment allocation, dosing irregularities, 
improper dosing documentation, frequency of double-dose infusions, drug accountability, maintenance of the 
blinding of the IMP, lack of documentation relating to inclusion/exclusion criteria and the training of staff. 
Considering clarifications provided by the applicant in writing and in an oral explanation, it is the view of the 
CHMP that it is not expected that the GCP findings would influence the results of the studies that the overall B/R 
of Respreeza could be affected.  
  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
At the primary cut-off date of 1 April 2013, the clinical development program of CE1226 included 6 studies (see

All 4 of the earlier studies (studies 101, 1002, 201, and 2002) investigated the biochemical effect of CE1226 i.v. 
administration in subjects with A1-PI deficiency.  
The single-dose studies were used primarily to characterize the pharmacokinetics of single doses of CE1226 and, 
in the case of study 1002, its bioavailability compared with Prolastin, another A1-PI product.  
The multiple-dose studies were designed to show the long-term maintenance of a trough serum antigenic A1-PI 
concentration above a threshold level of 11 µM during therapy with CE1226 (the basis for demonstrating 
biochemical efficacy) and to show the non-inferiority of CE1226 compared with Prolastin when used for therapy 
of A1-PI deficiency.  
The 2 more recent clinical studies (study 4001 and its extension study 3001) investigated the clinical efficacy 
and safety of CE1226 in support of the current application and proposed indication. Serum concentrations of 
antigenic and functional A1-PI were also measured during these studies, and these variables were considered as 
secondary endpoints in support of the assessments of clinical efficacy.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  applicant  has  performed  a  number  studies  investigating  the  long-term  maintenance  of  a  trough  serum 
antigenic A1-PI concentration above a threshold level of 11 µM during therapy with CE1226. There are no CHMP 
guidelines on the clinical investigation of human plasma-derived alpha1-proteinase inhibitor to apply.  
No  conventional  pharmacokinetic  studies  (absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion,  interaction  etc.) 
studies were performed with CE1226. This is in principle acceptable as the application concerns a plasma derived 
drug product where the aim of the treatment is to raise the plasma level of A1-PI in patients with A1-PI deficiency 
above the 11 μM threshold.  
Bioanalysis 
Antigenic and serum functional A1-PI concentrations have been measured throughout the clinical programme. 
In general significantly lower values were obtained via the functional assay. 
Study 4001 (pivotal) 
Study  4001  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multinational,  multicenter  study  that 
investigated the clinical efficacy of CE1226 in terms of slowing the progression of emphysema in subjects with 
A1-PI deficiency. Secondary endpoints included trough serum antigenic A1-PI concentrations. A total of 180 
subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive weekly 60 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) i.v. infusions of either CE1226 or 
placebo for a period of 24 months. Of the 180 subjects enrolled, 93 were randomized to CE1226 and 87 subjects 
to placebo. Eighty-four subjects in the CE1226 group and 69 subjects in the placebo group completed the study. 
The serum antigenic A1-PI concentrations over time were as follows:

Table 7 - Antigenic A1-PI concentration at each time point in subjects treated with CE1226 in study 4001 
(Screening to Day 720) 
In total, 33 out of 90 subjects treated with CE1226 had 1 or more values below 11 µM at some point during the 
study. In 23 of these subjects, this was a single occurrence. In a further 6 subjects, this happened twice, in 3 
subjects 3 times, and in 1 subject 5 times. Overall, these cases represent approximately 6% of all doses of 
CE1226 administered in the study. Most of these values were narrowly below the limit of 11 µM. The lowest 
single value measured during the study in subjects treated with CE1226 was 7.6 µM. 
Based on a population PK analysis, the residual variability (which approximates the population intra-subject 
variability) of Ctrough was 21.4%. 
Study 3001 (extension to Study 4001) 
In study 3001, non-US subjects who completed study 4001 are receiving CE1226 at a dose of 60 mg/kg/week 
for 2 years. Data are available from 76 subjects who had previously been treated in study 4001 with CE1226 
(Early Start subjects) and 64 subjects who had previously been treated with placebo (Delayed Start subjects). 
Full 48-month data were available from 40 Early Start subjects and 39 Delayed Start subjects.  
Across all time points, a similar proportion of subjects treated with CE1226 as in Study 4001 had A1-PI 
concentrations above 11 µM. 
Study 2002 
The primary objectives of this multicenter, randomized, controlled, multiple-dose study in subjects with A1-PI 
deficiency and emphysema were to demonstrate: (1) that the steady-state trough serum antigenic A1-PI 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 30/102 
 
  
  
 
 
concentrations achieved by weekly i.v. infusion of CE1226 were not inferior to those achieved by weekly i.v. 
infusion of Prolastin, and (2) that CE1226 maintained weekly trough serum antigenic A1-PI concentrations 
above the threshold of 11 µM. Of the 44 subjects (28 men, 16 women) enrolled, 30 were randomized to the 
CE1226-CE1226 group, and 14 subjects were randomized to the Prol-CE1226 group. 
A1-PI levels over time were above the therapeutic threshold of 11 µM with the exception of 2 measurements in 
one subject. Subject 246 had levels of 9.8 µM and 10.4 µM at Weeks 13 and 23, respectively. 
Study 201 
This open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, multiple-dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, and 
biochemical efficacy of CE1226 when administered by weekly i.v. infusion for 6 months at a dose of 60 mg/kg 
(functional activity) to subjects with A1-PI deficiency and emphysema. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
maintenance of weekly trough serum antigenic and functional A1-PI concentrations above a threshold level of 
11 µM from Week 7 to Week 26. 
Approximately 50 subjects were to enter study 201 to ensure completion of 40 evaluable subjects. Because of 
discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the planned statistical analysis as well as 
changes in the manufacturing process of CE1226, the study was discontinued prematurely and replaced by 
study 2002. At the time recruitment was stopped, 9 subjects (7 men, 2 women) had been enrolled at a single 
study center. All 9 subjects completed the 6-month treatment period according to the protocol as well as 2 to 
5 months of additional compassionate-use therapy. 
A total of one single data point was below 11 µM, and that value was 10.5 µM (trough level of Patient No. 10 at 
Week 11). 
Study 1002 
This was a double-blind, single-center, randomized, single-dose, 2x2 crossover study, whose primary objective 
was to compare the bioavailability of CE1226 and Prolastin when administered to subjects with A1-PI deficiency. 
CE1226 and Prolastin were administered as an i.v. dose of 60 mg/kg.  
Study 101 
This open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, single-dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of CE1226, administered as single i.v. infusion doses ranging from 15 to 120 mg/kg to 
subjects with A1-PI deficiency.  
Nineteen subjects (11 men, 8 women) were enrolled in the study and 15 patients were evaluable.  
The 60 mg/kg administration achieved A1PI trough serum concentrations above the 11 uM protective threshold. 
The results were as follows:

Study 101 
This open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, single-dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of CE1226, administered as single i.v. infusion doses ranging from 15 to 120 mg/kg to 
subjects with A1-PI deficiency.  
Nineteen subjects (11 men, 8 women) were enrolled in the study. At screening, serum antigenic A1-PI 
concentrations were between 4.4 and 9.4 µM (mean 5.7 µM). 
Each subject received a single i.v. infusion of either 15 mg/kg (N = 2), 30 mg/kg (N = 5), 60 mg/kg (N = 6), or 
120 mg/kg (N = 6) of CE1226. All 19 subjects completed the 21-day observation period according to protocol. 
Fifteen subjects in the 3 highest dose groups (3 subjects in the 30 mg/kg group, and 6 subjects each in the 60 
and 120 mg/kg groups) had blood samples drawn at pre-infusion, at the end of infusion, 30 minutes after the

end of infusion, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the end of infusion and on Days 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 for 
pharmacokinetic measurements. 
The 60 mg/kg administration achieved A1PI trough serum concentrations above the 11 uM protective threshold. 
Results, based on an antigenic assay, are shown below:

See Figure 1, mean concentration versus days (day 90-1440). 
Studies 201 and 2002 
In the long-term (6-month), multiple-dose studies 201 and 2002, the slope for mean trough serum A1-PI 
concentrations at steady-state was evaluated to assess whether there was a decline over time. 
In study 201, there was no evidence of a downward trend over time.  
Although in study 2002 there was a downward trend in mean trough serum antigenic A1-PI concentrations in 
subjects treated with CE1226 from Week 7 to Week 24, the mean concentration at steady-state remained above 
the threshold of 11 µM, as did the mean trough concentrations in each subject. The negative slope in 
steady-state antigenic A1-PI concentrations appeared to be transient, with a plateau of approximately 16 µM 
being reached after approximately 20 weeks of treatment.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based on a population PK analysis, the residual variability (which approximates the population intra-subject 
variability) of Ctrough was 21.4%. 
Special populations 
 
Impaired renal function 
Not studied. 
 
Impaired hepatic function 
Not studied. 
  Gender 
The effect of gender was not evaluated as a covariate in the dose-exposure model  
 
Race 
The effect of race/ethnicity was not evaluated as a covariate in the dose-exposure model due to limited data, 
100 % of the evaluated subjects were white. 
 
Weight 
Body weight was found to influence the A1-PI slope vs. dose rate in the dose-exposure analysis (coefficient 
-0.836). Higher body weight resulted in higher predicted A1-PI concentrations as a result of the proportional 
weight (mg/kg) based dosing. The mean bodyweight in the evaluated patient population was 77.4 (SD 15.2) kg 
(range 47-170.8 kg). 
 
Elderly 
In the dose-exposure analysis, no statistically significant effect of age on A1-P1 baseline or A1-PI slope vs. dose 
rate was found. The mean age of the evaluated patient population was 53.1 (SD 7.3) years (range 31-67 years). 
 
Children 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of CE1226 in pediatric subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
CHMP considered acceptable that no interaction studies, in vitro or in vivo, has been performed given that the 
active substance is an endogenous compound of a pharmacological class not expected to affect PK related 
processes. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Plasma Protein Binding Study Reports 
CE1226 is a plasma protein presented in its native form, therefore it is considered highly unlikely that it would 
be subject to alterations in biological activity due to plasma protein binding. . This was regarded as acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
Reports of Hepatic Metabolism and Drug Interaction Studies 
The metabolism of CE1226 is understood through the historical study of naturally occurring A1-PI. Normal A1-PI 
and neutrophil elastase are eliminated in the lung in a mutually suicidal interaction uninfluenced by hepatic 
status. Thus product specific hepatic metabolism studies have not been considered necessary. Similarly, as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 34/102 
 
  
  
 
 
therapeutic goal of A1-PI substitution therapy is to replace a deficiency in the circulating level of a naturally 
occurring protein with that same protein of human plasma origin, there is no expectation of a pharmacological 
effect on other drugs. 
Reports of Studies Using Other Human Biomaterials 
For the same reasons as given above for studies using other human biomaterials have not been deemed 
necessary. This was regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI), is a 52 kDa single polypeptide glycoprotein produced by 
hepatocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. A1-PI acts as the primary inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the 
lower respiratory tract. Neutrophil elastase is a protease capable of destroying alveolar walls in the lower 
respiratory tract. It is produced and secreted by activated neutrophils, and is primarily found in the alveolar and 
bronchial lumina (epithelial lining fluid [ELF]). If NE is present in the lung and not regulated by its naturally 
occurring inhibitor A1-PI, as is the case in A1-PI deficiency, NE can cause excessive inflammation and proteolysis 
of alveolar tissue, leading to progressive emphysema. 
Epithelial lining fluid (ELF) was obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in a subset of subjects in studies 101 
and 2002. While study 101 was a single-dose study and BAL was performed 6 days after dosing, the BAL in study 
2002 was performed 11 weeks after the start of weekly dosing (7 days after the 10th dose), at a time when 
serum A1-PI concentrations had achieved steady-state.  
ELF levels were effectively raised.

Purified human human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI) concentrate has been used for almost 2 decades for 
A1-PI augmentation therapy in individuals who have a reduced level or absence of functional A1-PI and a clinical 
evident lung disease. A target of achieving A1-PI serum concentrations above the 11 µM threshold has been the 
concept of biochemical efficacy in clinical studies of A1-PI augmentation therapies. The “protective level” of 
11 µM threshold (50 mg/dL) when measured by immunonephelometry (or 80 mg/dl when measured by radial 
immunodiffusion) has evolved from the observation that patients with heterozygote phenotypes whose levels of 
A1-PI exceed this level are usually free from emphysema (Crystal, 1998). 
The 11 µM threshold has been used as a target in a number of A1-PI augmentation studies also for products who 
have gained approval. Although, there is now at least one ongoing study which explores higher doses of purified 
human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, 120 mg/kg b.w. intravenously every week (SPARTA study).  This study is 
aiming at reaching higher levels of serum A1-PI, i.e. 20 µM, which would be at the lower end of the normal range 
for a healthy subject (20-53 µM). Although the 11 µM threshold has been used in a number of A1-PI 
augmentation studies it cannot truly be considered an optimised established therapy since the A1-PI plasma 
trough levels values in the normal range has not been explored. 
PK/PD 
A post-hoc exposure-response analysis of data in study 4001 indicated a linear relationship between exposure 
and the rate of decline in CT scan lung density. FEV1 was identified as a covariate, patients with lower FEV1 at 
baseline were found to have greater lung density decline rates. The results from the exposure-response analysis 
indicates that doses above 60 mg/kg and a target level higher than 11 µM may add further benefit in terms of 
a slower rate of decline in lung density. 
Mechanism of action 
Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is understood to be the primary anti-protease in the lower respiratory tract, 
where it inhibits neutrophil elastase (NE). Normal healthy individuals produce sufficient alpha1-proteinase 
inhibitor to control the NE produced by activated neutrophils and are thus able to prevent inappropriate 
proteolysis of lung tissue by NE. Conditions that increase neutrophil accumulation and activation in the lung, 
such as respiratory infection and smoking, will in turn increase levels of NE. However, individuals deficient in 
endogenous alpha1-proteinase inhibitor are unable to maintain appropriate antiprotease defence and experience 
more rapid proteolysis of the alveolar walls starting prior to the development of clinically evident chronic 
obstructive lung disease in the third or fourth decade. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No studies have been submitted this was regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
There are no CHMP guidelines on the clinical investigation of human plasma-derived alpha1-proteinase inhibitor 
to apply.  
No conventional absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion studies were performed with CE1226. This is 
in principle be acceptable as the application concerns a plasma derived drug product where the aim of the 
treatment is to raise the plasma level of A1-PI in patients with A1-PI deficiency above the 11 µM threshold.

Individuals with endogenous serum concentrations of A1-PI below 11 ìM generally manifest a significantly 
increased risk for development of emphysema compared with the background risk in the general population 
(World Health Organization 1996, Gadek 1983, Eriksson 1965, Eriksson 1964). Therefore, the maintenance of 
serum antigenic A1-PI concentrations above 11 µìM has, for almost 2 decades, been thought to provide 
therapeutically relevant anti-NE protection in the lung (Crystal 1990).  
Previous studies with other products containing plasma derived alpha1-proteinase inhibitor have demonstrated 
that weekly i.v. infusions at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight increased A1-PI concentrations above the 11 µM 
threshold in a majority of patients (Brantley et al. 2013). 
The focus of this assessment has been to bring clarity regarding the proportion of patients which are expected 
to be above the 11 µM threshold over time following weekly 60 mg/kg i.v. infusions also for this product. 
The possible influence of covariates , e.g. body weight or baseline levels of A1-PI, in relation to the wanted 
outcome, i.e. to be above the 11 µM threshold over time, was also focused on. 
Antigenic and serum functional A1-PI concentrations have been measured throughout the clinical programme. 
Study 4001 may be seen as the pivotal PK study given it included the largest sample size, the most 
heterogeneous population and included CE1226 from process C.  
Based on the presented data, it is expected that 99 % of the patients will reach an average trough serum 
antigenic A1-PI concentration above the threshold level of 11 µM. No clear correlation between specific patient 
characteristics and poor response (A1-PI concentrations below 11 µM) was found. 
Across the studies, PK data has not been stratified according to genotype. On the other hand, considering that 
the majority of patients had the ZZ genotype, conclusions are likely hard to draw regarding other genotypes and 
no request for an additional analysis is made. As subjects with the ZZ genotype has the lowest baseline levels of 
A1-PI, the study population represented “worst case scenario” in terms of increasing A1-PI concentration above 
the threshold level. 
Based on a limited number or patients in study 101, dose proportionality is indicated (although AUC in the 30 
mg/kg dose group is unexpectedly high).  
Pharmacodynamics 
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 3 subjects each at baseline and at Day 7 in the 30, 60, and 120 
mg/kg dosing groups of the single dose Study 101. A subset of 15 subjects (10 on CE1226 and 5 on Prolastin) 
participated in the BAL investigations in Study 2002, each before first infusion and 7 days after last blinded 
infusion at Week 11. In Study 2002 subjects were treated with weekly infusions of 60 mg/kg of A1-PI. An 
increase of antigenic A1-PI levels and A1-PI:NE complexes could be found in the epithelial lining fluid. This 
supports the hypothesis that after intravenous administration, A1-PI arrives in its active form in the lower lung 
where it has the ability to complex with free NE by building complexes.  
As the disease only occurs in adult age, the paediatric population is excluded from the indication and from 
clinical investigations with the product as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC after having received a 
product-specific waiver covering all subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 18 years of age 
has been granted (waiver decision number P/260/2012). 
Tobacco smoke increases the activity of neutrophil elastase in the lungs and thus directly compromises the 
effect of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. This should be referenced in the product information.

Although the 11 µM threshold has been used in a number of A1-PI augmentation studies it cannot truly be 
considered an optimised established therapy since the A1-PI plasma trough levels values in the normal range 
has not been explored. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Augmentation therapy increases the plasma A1-PI concentrations above 11 µM as intended in subjects with 
emphysema with a moderate airflow reduction. The achieved level of A1-PI concentrations in the study 
CE1226_4001 were 16 µM (11-23 µM, 90 % prediction interval) when measured at the end of the dosing period 
and the average serum A1-PI concentration throughout a dosing interval was estimated to be in the order of 19 
to 20 μM which is in the lower range of normal. The CHMP agreed to an approval of A1-PI(H) from a 
pharmacokinetic point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Single doses of CE1226 (15, 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) were administered in study 101 for a dose-ranging 
assessment of serum concentrations of A1-PI. Based upon these data, as well as the no observed adverse effect 
level seen in nonclinical studies, the 60 mg/kg weekly dose of CE1226 was chosen for investigating biochemical 
efficacy in the multiple-dose studies because it was expected to maintain serum antigenic A1-PI concentrations 
well above the widely-published “protective” threshold of 11 µM (Crystal 1990). In addition, this was the 
approved dose for Prolastin, which was used as the active comparator in study 2002. No study has prospectively 
addressed whether additional incremental benefit on lung density or function may be achieved with A1-PI levels 
above the 11 µM level. 
To conclude, the 60 mg/kg weekly dose was chosen based on the expectancy to maintain serum antigenic A1-PI 
concentrations above the threshold of 11 µM. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two phase III studies, CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001 (ongoing), were performed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of A1 PI augmentation therapy over 2-4 years in subjects with A1 PI deficiency. 
CE1226_4001 
Title: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase III/IV study to compare the efficacy 
and safety of 60 mg/kg body weight of Zemaira® weekly i.v. administration with placebo weekly i.v. 
administration in chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in subjects with emphysema due to 
alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3/4 study to compare safety and 
efficacy of a weekly intravenous (i.v.) dose of 60 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) CE1226 with placebo. The study 
population comprised A1-PI deficient subjects with emphysema and reduced lung function, with forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 35% and ≤ 70% predicted. Subjects were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 
to CE1226 or placebo.  
The study consisted of a screening period of 1 week to 1 month, and a treatment period of 24 months. 
During the treatment period, each subject received weekly infusions of the investigational medicinal product 
(IMP). The first dose of the IMP and the doses given during the following quarterly visits at the study center were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 38/102 
 
  
  
administered by the investigator or designate. All other weekly doses could be given by the nurses of a home 
care service or by the family doctor. Where possible, all doses were given at the study center. The subjects 
returned to the study center every 3 months for a physical examination including AE collection, blood draw, and 
study specific procedures. Each subject kept a diary to document all AEs and exacerbations observed, and/or 
any concomitant medication taken during the time between hospital visits.  
CT scans for the primary efficacy analysis were conducted in all subjects prior to start of IMP administration, and 
after 3, 12, 21, and 24 months. Assessment of quality of life (QoL) using the SGRQ were performed in all 
subjects prior to start of IMP administration, after 12 and after 24 months. 
CE1226_3001 
Title: An open-label, non-controlled, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
Zemaira® administration in chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in subjects with emphysema due to 
alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency who completed clinical study CE1226_4001. 
This is an ongoing, open-label, non-controlled, multicenter, multinational study. A1-PI deficient individuals 
with emphysema, who had completed the 2-year treatment and observation period in the 
CE1226_4001 study, except those participating in the USA, were invited to participate in study CE1226_3001. 
All subjects are planned to be treated with treated with weekly intravenous (i.v.) administrations of CE1226 at 
a dose of 60 mg/kg b.w. for up to 2 years. 
Considering the longitudinal results of the 2 studies sequentially, subjects can be considered as early or delayed 
starters on CE1226 treatment. Those subjects who had already been allocated to receive 
CE1226 treatment during study CE1226_4001 represent the Early Start group and had received up to 4 years of 
continuous therapy at the end of study CE1226_3001. Subjects who received placebo in study CE1226_4001 
and only began to receive CE1226 treatment upon entry into study CE1226_3001 represent the Delayed Start 
group and had a maximal exposure of 2 years at the end of study CE1226_3001. 
The subjects returned to the study center every 3 months for a medical review and study-specific procedures. 
Each subject kept a diary to document all AEs and exacerbations (ie, onset and duration) observed, and any 
concomitant medication taken during the time between hospital visits. The investigator or delegate documented 
the use of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) and any AEs he/she might have observed in the subject 
diary. These diaries were collected and checked by the investigator/designate during each visit.  
CT scans for the primary efficacy analysis were performed at Month 36 and at the end of study CE1226_3001 
(Month 48). 
The planned interim analyses compared the efficacy witnessed within and between the Early Start and Delayed 
Start groups in the periods of Baseline to Month 24, Baseline to Month 48, and Month 24 to Month 48. 
Specifically this interim analysis was conducted to: 
•  Confirm, through the pattern of response between the Early Start and Delayed Start groups, that CE1226 
treatment is a disease modifying intervention in emphysema due to A1-PI deficiency (cut-off date: 06 
February 2013). 
•  Examine the 3 hypotheses for exploratory purposes to support the notion of disease modifying effects by 
comparing lung density decline measured by CT in the Early Start and Delayed Start groups within study 
CE1226_3001 and across studies CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001 (cut-off date: 06 February 2013). 
•  Explore the safety and tolerability profiles between the Early Start and Delayed Start groups within study 
CE1226_3001 and across studies CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001 (cut-off date: 01 April 2013).

Objectives 
Study CE1226_4001 
Primary objective 
To investigate the effect of CE1226 on the progression of emphysema, assessed by the decline of lung density, 
measured by CT. 
Key Secondary objective 
The key secondary objectives were to assess the effect of treatment with A1-PI on the following clinical 
assessments: 
  Change in exercise capacity assessed by the ISWT 
  Change in symptoms assessed by the SGRQ 
 
The rate of pulmonary exacerbations 
Additional secondary objectives included assessments of the effect of CE1226 on pulmonary function test (PFT) 
parameters. Incidence and nature of adverse events (AEs), viral serology, and serum A1-PI antibodies, 
laboratory parameter levels, and vital signs were further safety variables. 
Study CE1226_3001 (interim analysis) 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this interim analysis was to investigate the long-term effect of a disease modifying 
benefit of CE1226 on the progression of emphysema, assessed by volume adjusted lung density, measured by 
yearly CT scans. 
Secondary objective 
The following secondary objectives were evaluated during this interim analysis: 
  Absolute and relative (%) change in lung density, as measured by CT scans across time points between 
study CE1226_4001 (Baseline to Month 24) and study CE1226_3001 (Month 24 to Month 48) within the 
Early Start and Delayed Start groups. 
  Safety of CE1226, as assessed throughout study CE1226_3001 by standard adverse event(AE) 
reporting. 
Outcomes/endpoints

Study CE1226_3001 (Interim analysis) 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
 
Primary efficacy variable is the 15th percentile of the lung density measured by the frequency histogram 
of the lung pixels in yearly CT scans. 
Key secondary Endpoints: 
 
 
The key secondary efficacy variables were the absolute and % change of lung density as measured by 
Adjusted P15 from CT scans acquired between Baseline and Month 48, also taking into account 
measures from study CE1226_4001. 
The absolute and % change from Baseline to Month 48 were derived using the values of 
Adjusted P15 of the last assessment of CT scans from study CE1226_3001 and the first assessment of CT scans 
from study CE1226_4001. 
Sample size 
Study CE1226_4001 
It was initially planned to enrol 100 subjects in study 4001, randomized 1:1 to 2 treatment groups (CE1226 and 
placebo). This sample size estimation was based on the results of Dirksen et al. 1999 evaluating the difference 
in yearly decline of lung density between placebo and active treatment in a total of 56 subjects with A1-PI 
deficiency. The average estimates obtained in the Dirksen study from CT scans of the whole lung and of a single 
slice 5 cm below the carina were used for the sample size estimation. With this assumption and considering the 
loss to follow-up, it was estimated that 50 subjects per treatment group would enable the study to achieve 80% 
power at a 1-sided level of significance of 0.025 to detect an effect size of 1 g/L/year on the decline in lung 
density, with a standard deviation (SD) of approximately 2.5 g/L/year. 
Due to the small sample size of the Dirksen study, an unblinded interim analysis was planned to re-estimate the 
sample size of study. The interim analysis was planned to be conducted when 50 subjects had completed the 
2-year treatment period in the study. It was also planned that if 100 subjects had been randomized but the 
interim analysis was not yet able to be performed because an insufficient number of subjects had reached the 
2-year treatment period at the time enrolment reaches 100, then, in order to avoid halting enrolment and

thereby introducing a discontinuity in recruitment, enrolment would continue up to 180 randomized subjects or 
until the interim analysis results were available. whichever occurred first. The decision of enrolment of 180 
subjects was based on the previous sample size assumption and was estimated that it would increase the study 
power to 92% at a 1-sided level of significance of 0.025. If the interim analysis results were available prior to the 
completion of 180 subjects, a decision on the final sample size would be made. 
Based on this, in 2009 CSL Behring submitted a protocol amendment to continue enrolment up to a maximum 
of 180 randomized subjects or until 50 subjects had completed the study so the planned interim analysis could 
be conducted.  
In 2010, a blinded re-estimation of the study sample size was done using data accrued on 69 subjects with at 
least 1 post-baseline CT scan who had either completed the study already or discontinued prematurely. In 
addition, this analysis was also performed for all subjects with at least 2 post-baseline density measurements. 
The slope of the regression line for the decline in lung density based on this blinded sample size re-estimation 
indicated that the SD used in the original sample size estimation can be employed and no re-estimation was 
needed. It also indicated that 180 subjects would provide at least 88% power to detect the previous assumed 
effect size of 1 g/L (SD = 2.5 g/L) difference in the yearly decline in lung density at a 1-sided significance level 
of 0.025, or would be sufficient to maintain at least 80% power to detect 1.07 g/L (SD = 2.17 g/L) difference in 
the yearly decline if the estimate was based on the results generated from CT scans of the whole lung published 
by Dirksen et al. 1999. Since enrolment was almost complete by the time the interim analysis could be 
performed, the decision not to carry out the interim analysis planned in the original protocol was made. 
Study CE1226_3001 
All subject completing study 4001 and meeting the inclusion criteria were eligible for inclusion in study 3001. No 
sample size calculations were performed. 
Randomisation 
Study CE1226_4001 
In study 4001 all subjects screened for the study were entered chronologically on the “subject screening log” at 
the initial visit to the study center. If a subject was not enrolled into the study, the reason was documented on 
the subject screening log. Subjects were randomized at a ratio of 1:1. The randomization was stratified by 
center. A randomization list containing the assignment of subject numbers to treatment groups (CE1226 or 
placebo) was reproducibly generated by a computerized pseudo-random number generator. A copy of the 
randomization list was transferred to the drug supply and logistics group of the Clinical Operations Department 
at CSL Behring. Standard operating procedures were followed to ensure confidentiality of the randomization list. 
Study CE1226_3001 
Study 3001 is an open-label non-randomized study with one single treatment. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study CE1226_4001 
Study 4001 was a double-blind study. CE1226 and placebo were packaged identically. Individual packages were 
identified only by the subject number. The treatment groups randomized to the subject numbers were only 
known to the randomization code administrator, and to the drug supply and logistics group of the Clinical 
Operations Department at CSL Behring.  A potential compromise to the blinding of the IMP was identified early 
in the study due to a visual difference between the reconstituted CE1226 and placebo preparations. This issue 
was addressed by ensuring that the IMP was physically masked after reconstitution. However, it appears that 
this measure was not implemented in a timely fashion at center 11. Thus, for the analyses of AEs, a robustness 
analysis was carried out to account for the potential unblinding issue at center 11.

Study 3001 was an open-label study without blinding. 
Statistical methods 
Study CE1226_4001 
The following analysis populations were defined for the analyses in study 4001: 
Randomized population: All randomized subjects. 
Intention-to-treat (ITT) population: All subjects with A1-PI deficiency that were included in the study and 
randomized. In the ITT analysis, subjects were assigned to the treatment to which they were randomized. 
Per-protocol (PP) population: A subset of the ITT population, in which subjects with a major protocol 
deviation were excluded. Pre-specified definitions of major protocol deviations are summarized in the study 
report. Only data affected by the protocol deviations were excluded. The final decision regarding which subjects 
and which data were excluded from the PP analysis was made before the data were unblinded, during the Blind 
Data Review Meeting. In the PP analysis, subjects were assigned to the treatment groups to which they were 
randomized. 
Safety population: All subjects who were included in the study and who received at least 1 dose of IMP. The 
Safety population was used for the safety analysis. In the safety analysis, subjects were analyzed according to 
the treatment they actually received, defined as the treatment received most of the time during the study. 
The ITT population was the primary population for the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study 4001 is the annual rate of change of lung density, measured as 15th 
percentile from the frequency histogram of the lung pixels (p15) using CT scans. Data were collected at 2 states 
of inspiration, total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC) which were used separately or in 
combination according to different analytical approaches. 
The two different methods proposed to standardize percentile densities for variations in lung volume measured 
from CTs are the physiologic adjustment method and the statistical adjustment method by Dirksen et al (2009). 
Since the physiologic adjustment has the advantage of being intuitively meaningful, and each measured density 
value can be adjusted for simultaneously measured lung volume independent of measurements from other 
scans, the primary efficacy variable, of the study, adjusted P15, is based on the physiologic adjustment. 
adjusted P15 = observed p15 · (measured lung volume / predicted TLC). Predicted TLC will be derived as 
7.99 · [height in m] - 7.08 for males, and 
6.60 · [height in m] - 5.79 for females. 
This will be taken at full inspiration (TLC) and full expiration (FRC). 
For the primary statistical analysis, no values were imputed. All available data were included in the analysis. All 
randomized subjects with at least 1 valid CT scan (at any time point) were included. Missing values were 
assumed to be missing at random (MAR). Descriptive statistics are provided for measured values of Adjusted 
P15 (g/L), change from baseline, and % change from baseline at TLC and FRC inspiration states, and mean of 
TLC and FRC, by quarterly visit and at last visit. Descriptive statistics are presented overall and stratified by the 
baseline  
The primary efficacy variable, Adjusted P15 values, were analyzed at TLC and FRC inspiration states, meaning 
the TLC and FRC values were included in the primary model simultaneously (i.e., TLC and FRC states combined). 
A linear random regression model was applied using SAS PROC MIXED, with country, inspiration state, time 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 45/102 
 
  
  
elapsed since Day 1 (year), treatment, and treatment-by-time interaction (i.e., a regression of Adjusted P15 on 
time within treatment) as fixed effects and subject and subject-by-time interaction as random coefficients. 
Thus, the primary efficacy model contained the subjects’ individual intercept and individual slope. 
The principal interest was in the magnitude of the treatment-by-time interaction (difference of the regressions 
on time within treatment) and its level of significance, because this indicated whether the 2 treatments differed 
in their effect on the rate of decline of Adjusted P15. The difference between the regression coefficients from 
each of the treatments (CE1226 minus placebo), 95% CI for the difference and the 1-sided p-value are 
presented. A 1-sided p-value less than 0.025 and a positive estimate of the treatment difference of CE1226 
minus placebo, i.e., the lower bound of the 95% CI being greater than zero, were taken to indicate superiority 
of CE1226 compared to placebo. 
In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed by applying the primary efficacy analysis model (without 
the fixed effect for inspiration state) to the CT scans at TLC and FRC states separately. 
Statistical adjustment was performed by including the logarithm of measured TLV as a covariate in the statistical 
model.  
Based on the European Medicines Agency’s recommendation (“Guideline on missing data in confirmatory clinical 
trials” dated 02 July 2010), a set of analyses where the missing data were handled in different ways were used 
as sensitivity analyses to verify the results from the primary analysis. The following sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to support the primary analysis using the subject populations: 
•  Complete-case analysis (baseline and Month 24): All subjects with valid CT scans at baseline and Month 
24 were included in this analysis. Missing CT scans at Months 3, 12, or 21 were not imputed. The missing 
values were assumed to be missing completely at random (MCAR). This analysis was considered to have 
more bias in favor of CE1226, as completers are expected to have a better treatment outcome. 
•  Pattern-mixture model with placebo-based pattern imputation: The ITT population was used for this 
imputation including randomized subjects without any valid CT scans. All missing data were replaced by 
multiple imputation based on the subjects randomized to placebo. The missing values were assumed to 
be missing not at random (MNAR). Since the imputations were sampled from the subjects randomized 
to placebo, this analysis was considered to be conservative in favor of placebo. 
•  Worst-case approach: The ITT population was used for this imputation including randomized subjects 
without any valid CT scans. All subjects with a valid CT scan at baseline and a scan at any given time 
point were used for worst-case estimation for the given time point. The missing scans will be imputed in 
the following steps: 1) At each time point scheduled for obtaining CT scans after baseline (i.e., 3, 12, 21, 
and 24 months), a mixed model will be applied similar to the primary model including all subjects with 
data up to this time point. The individual slopes obtained from the model at time i will be ranked. The 
10% subjects with the worst slopes will be selected, provided their slopes fall into a range of ± 3 SD 
around the mean slope (note that the mean slope is by definition 0 in this model). The restriction that 
the individual slopes must fall into a range of ± 3 SD will prevent from selecting extreme outliers which 
are not representative of the data. 2) The individual data at time i of the selected 10% subjects with the 
worst slopes will be used to estimate a linear regression of Adjusted P15 at time t on the baseline value 
of Adjusted P15. The regression model will include sex, age, and the baseline value of Adjusted P15. The 
regression will be estimated for each inspiration state (TLC and FRC) separately. The missing value of a 
subject at this time point will be imputed by the subject’s baseline value multiplied by the regression 
coefficient associated with the baseline value of Adjusted P15 obtained from the regression model as 
described above (at each inspiration state). This method will be repeated at all scheduled time points 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 46/102 
 
  
  
after baseline and missing values at each time point will be imputed accordingly. 3) For subjects without 
any CT scans or without CT scan at baseline, the data points for each inspiration state (TLC and FRC) at 
time t will be imputed based on averaged values of Adjusted P15 at time t obtained from the 10% 
subjects with the worst slopes (falling inside a range of ± 3 SD) by this time point. The Adjusted P15 at 
baseline will be imputed based on averaged values of Adjusted P15 at baseline from the 10% subjects 
with the worst slopes who were ever selected at any time t. 
The effect of the region will be investigated using the primary model with country replaced by region. The 
difference between the regression coefficients from each of the treatments (Zemaira® minus Placebo), 95% CI 
for the difference and the one-sided p-value will be presented. 
Study CE1226_3001 
The results of the interim analysis is included in this application, the purpose and methods for this analysis was 
defined in a protocol amendment 
The following analysis populations were defined for the interim analyses in study 3001: 
ITT population: All subjects included in study CE1226_3001 after having provided signed informed consent. 
ITT* population: A reduced ITT population limited to those subjects with at least 2 valid CT scans during study 
CE1226_3001. 
Safety population: All subjects included in study CE1226_3001 and who received at least 1 dose of IMP during 
the study. 
The ITT and ITT* populations were used for the analysis of efficacy variables. For endpoint analyses, observed 
cases, where subjects with a Baseline and an endpoint assessment available, was included. The Safety 
population was used for all safety analyses. 
In study CE1226_3001, all subjects received CE1226. However, based on the randomization assignment during 
study CE1226_4001, 2 treatment groups were defined as follows: 
•  Early Start group: subjects who were randomized to CE1226 in study CE1226_4001 and continued to 
receive CE1226 in study CE1226_3001. 
•  Delayed Start group: subjects who were randomized to placebo in study CE1226_4001 and were 
reallocated to receive CE1226 in study CE1226_3001. 
In the original protocol the study objective was to collect long-term data on safety and efficacy using the weekly 
dosage of 60 mg/kg b.w. The analysis plan was to use descriptive analysis of the efficacy variables stratified 
according to the assigned treatment in study CE1226_4001 and adverse events were to be summarized on a 
preferred term basis with reference to intensity and presumed relationship to study drug. In substantial 
amendment no. 1 the analysis plan was changed to state: 
The statistical analysis will follow the same lines as planned for the Phase III/IV Zemaira® CE1226_4001 study. 
Efficacy and safety variables will be compared with respect to the randomized treatment group in the Phase 
III/IV Zemaira® CE1226_4001 study. Similar statistical models and methods will be applied. Baseline will be the 
final assessment of the Phase III/IV Zemaira® CE1226_4001  
In version 4 of the protocol the interim analysis was defined. It defined 3 hypotheses to be tested: 
1.  Confirm the efficacy of CE1226 in the first 2 years for those subjects continuing into study CE1226_3001 
(Baseline to Month 24). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 47/102 
 
  
  
2.  Explore the difference in achieved efficacy between the Early Start and Delayed Start groups across all 4 
years (Baseline to Month 48). 
3.  Compare the rate of disease progression between the Early Start and Delayed Start groups in the last 2 
years (Month 24 to Month 48). 
The ITT population was used to examine Hypothesis 1. The ITT* population was used to examine Hypotheses 1, 
2, and 3. 
Substantial amendment no 1. was implemented early, but during patient enrolment period, substantial 
amendment no 2 as resulted in protocol version 4, was implemented in 2013 in order to implement the interim 
analysis. 
The primary endpoint was the 15th percentile of the lung density measured by yearly CT scans. The hypotheses 
tested were not for confirmatory purposes, all analyses were exploratory. No values were imputed. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the annual rate of change in volume-adjusted lung density, Adjusted P15, obtained from 
a linear random regression (mixed effects) model and was expressed as a slope of time and treatment 
interaction from the model. 
The change in the annual rate of lung density decline as measured by Adjusted P15 was calculated based on a 
mixed effects model at TLC and FRC inspiration states separately, as well as at a combined inspiration state. For 
the values corresponding to the TLC and FRC combined inspiration state, a fixed effect of inspiration state 
corrected for the different levels at each inspiration state. The principal interest was in the magnitude of the 
treatment-by-time interaction used to estimate the annual rate of change in lung density decline and its level of 
significance using the data obtained at TLC inspiration state. 
The lung density as measured by Adjusted P15 obtained at TLC state was expected to be less affected by 
unexplained variation (noise) than those taken at FRC (Stoel and Stolk, 2004). The difference between the 
regression coefficients from each of the treatment groups indicated whether the 2 treatment groups differed in 
their effect on the annual rate of change in lung density decline as measured by Adjusted P15 from the CT scans. 
The detailed model specification is provided in the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9). Exploratory examination of 
Hypothesis 1 was made by applying the same primary efficacy endpoint analysis as used in study CE1226_4001, 
however restricted to the smaller subset of subjects who were included in study CE1226_3001. 
Since the data from study CE1226_3001 were no longer obtained from a randomized sample and comparisons 
were exploratory, missing data were not considered to be relevant given the exploratory nature of this interim 
analysis.

Study CE1226_4001 
Most of the subjects who withdrew consent had previously experienced TEAEs (Listing 16.2.7), which may have 
contributed to their decision to withdraw from the study. 
A post-hoc analysis of the proportion of subjects who withdrew from the study over time comparing the CE1226 
and placebo groups revealed a statistically significantly (p = 0.04) lower probability for withdrawal of subjects in 
the CE1226 group 
Protocol deviations (CE1226_4001): 
The number of subjects with major protocol deviations was comparable between the CE1226 (10 [10.8%] 
subjects) and placebo (11 [12.6%] subjects) groups. All subjects with major protocol deviations were excluded 
from the PP population.  
Other deviations 
Deviations related to the conduct of the study were noted at 1 center (Professor McElvaney, Ireland, center 11; 
11 subjects in each treatment group, where a number of exacerbations were confirmed clinically and recorded 
as AEs without recording the symptoms related to the Anthonisen criteria in the CRF. The AEs corresponding to 
the clinically confirmed exacerbations were flagged. For center 11, all exacerbations that fulfilled the Anthonisen 
criteria were included as exacerbations. In addition, the clinically confirmed exacerbations identified by the 
corresponding AE number were also included as exacerbations, irrespective of any symptoms entered in the CRF 
for exacerbations. Sensitivity analyses were carried out after censoring data from center 11 to assess whether 
this issue had any effect on the overall analyses of the exacerbation data. These analyses were performed for 
the exercise capacity test, and for the rate of exacerbations, and showed trends that were similar to the analyses 
including data from center 11. 
Furthermore, a potential compromise to the blinding of the IMP was identified early in the study due to a visual 
difference between the reconstituted CE1226 and placebo preparations. 
Assessment report

This issue was addressed by ensuring that the IMP was physically masked after reconstitution. However, it 
appears that this measure was not implemented in a timely fashion at center 11. Thus, for the analyses of AEs, 
a robustness analysis was carried out to account for the potential unblinding issue at center 11. PTs that were 
deemed “at least possibly related” when they occurred as AEs in subjects at centers other than center 11 were 
all upgraded to “possibly related” at center 11 if they occurred at center 11, regardless of their original causality 
assessment. This robustness analysis revealed no relevant effect on the TEAE or SAE profiles for CE1226 or 
placebo treatments.

Protocol amendments 
There were 6 substantial amendments to the original study protocol (version 1, dated 25 July 2005). The main 
substantial changes are summarized below. Apart from Amendment 1, all amendments were implemented after 
the first subject had been enrolled into the study (01 March 2006). In addition, there were numbers of 
non-substantial amendments.  
The main substantial changes: 
Protocol version 3.0, 26 September 2005, Amendment 1  
The text was updated to provide, in very rare cases, for additional CT scans that could have been necessary 
because of incorrect scans due to technical or human error. A respective reference to literature regarding the 
exercise capacity test was also made. 
Protocol version 4.0, 29 August 2006, Amendment 2 
•  The inclusion criteria have been changed; i.e. the upper age limit has been changed from 60 to 65 years.  
•  A coordinating investigator was nominated. 
•  Missing actions (handing over and reviewing of subject diaries) during the Visits 1 and 2 were added. 
•  No IMP was to be given during Visit 10, because no follow-up period was planned. 
•  The description of the statistical analysis was revised after it was found that, due to an oversight, 
changes to the proposed analysis made in response to discussions with the FDA had not been 
implemented in the protocol. 
•  Revisions were made to describe the nomination of a central laboratory and the involvement of a 
distribution center for issuing the IMP. 
•  The responsible person for SAE reporting was changed. 
• 
Incorrect terms and wording in the study protocol were changed.

Protocol version 5.0, 28 September 2006, Country specific Amendment Czech Republique 
•  The patients were offered the possibility to select the most appropriate and convenient way for the 
regular study medication applications (to either in the study center, or by nurses of a home care service, 
or by the family doctor) 
Protocol version 6.0, 23 July 2008, Amendment 3 
• 
Inclusion criteria were revised to clarify that vaccinated subjects with positive hepatitis A and/or B 
serology and no signs of chronic or acute hepatitis A and/or B could be enrolled in the study. 
•  Exclusion criteria were revised to allow for inclusion of subjects with a positive cotinine test due to 
nicotine replacement therapy (eg, patches, chewing gum) or snuff. 
•  The number of planned study centers was increased due to the low recruitment rate. 
•  Provision was made for genotyping at a central laboratory in countries where genotyping could not be 
performed due to technical reasons. 
•  Appendix 5 (CT Scan) was amended as follows: 
− Clarification of the procedure for acquiring whole lung density evaluations, 
− Clarification of the procedure for replacement of a CT scanner at an institution during conduct of the study, 
− Provision for availability of additional phantom scans during the center qualification procedure, 
− Clarification of the use of a short acting bronchodilator to facilitate holding of breath in the CT procedure, as 
needed. (Change from: A short acting bronchodilator (beta-mimetic spray) with a standardized dose needs to be 
applied within the 4 hours preceding the CT scanning, for standardization purposes and to facilitate breath hold. 
Change to: If optimal therapy for the treatment of the subject’s emphysematous condition is interrupted for any 
reason, a short acting bronchodilator (beta sympathomimetic amine spray) with a standardized dose should be 
used by the subject within the 4 hours preceding the CT scanning to facilitate the required breath holds in the 
procedure.) 
• The description of the statistical analysis of CT evaluations was updated. In the previous version of the study 
protocol, the analysis was defined for the 15th percentile of the lung density (P15) without reference to the lung 
volume. The text was modified to account for this dependency. 
•  The abbreviation list was updated. 
•  The text on documentation and use of study findings was revised. 
•  Changes in department name and staff were implemented. 
•  The name of the sponsor was changed from ZLB Behring to CSL Behring. 
•  Protocol version 7.0, 12 January 2009, Amendment 4 
•  Sample size adaption: up to 180 subjects were to be enrolled until the (originally intended) interim 
analysis, whichever occurred first. 
•  Changes in study personnel were documented. 
•  Contact information (fax and email) was updated for SAE reporting. 
Assessment report

•  The text was revised to include the need for pregnancy occurring during the study to be reported. 
•  Additional units ( or < 80 mg/dL) were added for the serum A1-PI levels specified in the inclusion criteria 
to < 11 µM or < 80 mg/dL) 
•  Diagnosis of A1-PI deficiency criteria, A1-PI level was changed from < 11 µM to < 11 µM or < 80 mg/dL. 
•  Accovion GmbH was removed from the protocol. 
•  Administrative changes were documented. 
Protocol version v.2.0, 12 October 2010, Amendment 5 
Changes were made to the proposed statistical analysis (see below), and the SAE reporting process was 
clarified. 
Protocol version V1.0, 27 June 2012, Amendment 6 
•  The document was placed into the latest version of CSL Behring’s protocol document template 
(STPRE011 version 9). 
•  The analysis of the primary endpoint was clarified. 
•  The key secondary objectives were listed separately from the remaining secondary objectives and were 
ranked in the following hierarchical order: change in exercise capacity assessed by ISWT, change in 
symptoms score assessed by SGRQ, and risk of pulmonary exacerbation assessed by the annual rate of 
exacerbations. The rationale for this change was to identify those key secondary efficacy parameters 
that would help to explain the clinical relevance of the primary objective, ie, lung density change 
measured by CT scan. The text pertaining to secondary endpoints and efficacy variables, as well as 
exploratory endpoints and efficacy variables, was adjusted accordingly throughout the study protocol. 
•  Text describing determination of the sample size and the study population was modified to reflect the 
historical data more accurately and describe each subject population in this study more extensively. 
•  The primary efficacy analysis was updated because a physiological adjustment (lung volume-adjusted) 
lung density was applied in this study for the primary analysis. 
•  The secondary efficacy analysis was updated and elaborated according to the order of the adjusted key 
and additional secondary objectives mentioned above. 
•  The safety analysis was updated to include details of the analysis method and an updated definition of 
ARs to “AEs starting within 72 hours of the end of IMP administration plus all AEs at least possibly related 
to the administration of IMP”; this update to the definition was made in order to comply with FDA 
requirements. 
•  The interim analysis was removed from the study protocol per communication with the FDA dated 10 
May 2011. 
Changes in the planned analyses 
Originally (amended protocol 4 dated 12 January 2009) it was planned to carry out an unblinded re-estimation 
of the sample size once 50 subjects had completed the 2-year treatment period. Instead, in 2010 a blinded 
reestimation of the study sample size was done using data accrued on 69 subjects with at least 1 post-baseline 
CT scan who had either completed the study already or withdrew prematurely. Due to the outcome of this 
blinded re-estimation of the study sample size the planned unblinded interim analysis was not conducted.

In the amended protocol 6 dated 27 June 2012, it was stated that the number of exacerbations (and related 
symptoms) would be analyzed using a Poisson regression model, and that the procedure GENMOD would be 
used for the Poisson regression. This was a typographic error in the protocol. The number of exacerbations (and 
related symptoms) were analyzed using a negative binomial model, as stated in the synopsis of, and elsewhere 
in, the protocol. 
During blinded review of the data, it was decided to implement the following changes to the analysis: 
•  Present analysis of other pulmonary function assessments, BMI, SGRQ total, activity, and impacts 
scores, and CRP only for ITT population. The ITT population was the population of primary interest. 
•  Present correlation analyses only for the PP population. It was assumed that the variation in the PP 
population would be smaller than in the ITT population. Relationships between variables would be more 
pronounced in the PP population. 
•  Omit the analysis of exacerbation related symptoms. Only very few symptoms were entered on the CRF 
when the definition of an exacerbation was not fulfilled. The data did not support the analyses outlined 
in the study protocol. 
•  Omit the stratification based on i-BODE score as the dyspnea scale was only collected for subjects with 
exacerbations that fulfilled the Anthonisen criteria. 
•  Omit the analysis of proportion of subjects who stopped the exercise capacity test. The question in the 
CRF “Was the test stopped prematurely?” was not answered consistently because “premature stop of 
the test” was not clearly defined. 
•  Calculate “expected compliance” in addition to “overall compliance.” It was considered of interest to 
relate compliance, not only to the actual treatment duration, but also to the planned treatment duration. 
• 
Include the number of screening failures in summary tables and listings. This is a requirement from 
regulatory authorities. 
In addition, an error was corrected in the description of the “worst-case approach” sensitivity analysis of the 
primary efficacy variable. The 99% CI originally suggested is a measure for the accuracy of the estimated mean 
and is not suitable for identifying outliers. Outliers among estimates for the individual slopes were instead 
defined by all values outside a range of ± 3 SD around the mean (the mean being 0 by definition in this model). 
The summary tables for demographic and other baseline characteristics were only presented overall, and not 
stratified by the baseline parameters described in the SAP. 
The mean annual rate of change in Adjusted P15 and its 95% CI were presented based on subjects with 
particular patterns of valid CT scans only for the primary analysis, but not for the sensitivity analyses. 
Study CE1226_3001 
Protocol amendments 
There were 2 substantial amendments to the original study protocol (dated 30 November 2007). The main 
changes are summarized below. 
The first of 2 global substantial amendments in study CE1226_3001 was implemented on 23 July 2008 to 
harmonize the statistical analysis methods to match those foreseen for study CE1226_4001 and introduce a 
more detailed efficacy analysis under the assumptions that the full results for study CE1226_3001 would follow 
2 years after closure of study CE1226_4001 and, more importantly, that no interim analysis was anticipated in 
study CE1226_3001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 54/102 
 
  
  
The second amendment dates from May 2013 and reflects changes to the SAP for study CE1226_3001 following 
the corroboration of study CE1226_4001 data with the 4-part methodology published by Dirksen et al 2009. 
Specifically, both study CE1226_4001 and the EXACTLE study achieved statistical significance with similar 
methodology assessing the change from Baseline using statistically adjusted lung density obtained at the TLC 
inspiration state. Confirming this pattern of efficacy over a 4-year period as well as examining the disease 
modifying effects of CE1226 through the 3 hypotheses postulated, 2 years prior to study completion was the 
rationale for introducing this interim analysis into study CE1226_3001. 
Changes in the planned analyses 
The statistical analyses included in this interim were performed as specified in the protocol 
Amendment 2 and the SAP, both dated on 15 May 2013. 
This interim analysis is in addition to the planned analyses after completion of the study. 
Specifically, the following analytical changes were introduced for the interim analysis: 
 
Tables for demography and Baseline characteristics added for subjects with CT scans until Month 36 and 
until Month 48. 
  Add analysis of rate of change in Adjusted P15 for subjects who have at least 2 valid scans from Month 
24 to 48. 
  Use only subjects who have Baseline, Month 24, and Month 48 CT scans for analyses of absolute and % 
change in Adjusted P15. 
  Use Baseline CT scan as covariate for analyses of change in Adjusted P15 from Baseline at Month 24 and 
change from Baseline at Month 48 analyses. Use Month 24 CT scan as covariate for change from Month 
24 at Month 48 analysis. 
  Use 1-sided p-value for analyses of rate of change in Adjusted P15 according to impact of exploratory 
covariates. 
  Use arithmetic means instead of least-squares means to estimate mean change in Adjusted P15 from 
Baseline at Month 24 and mean Change from Month 24 at Month 48. Use paired t-test to compare the 
mean difference of changes between the 2 periods instead of the mixed model approach proposed in the 
SAP.

Study CE1226_4001 
Medical history 
The proportion of subjects who had a medical history that was not ongoing at baseline was 72.0% in the CE1226 
group and 63.2% in the placebo group. Among these subjects, the SOC with the highest incidence of medical 
history was surgical and medical procedures, with an incidence of 41.9% in the CE1226 group and of 42.5% in 
the placebo group. The next most common (at least 10% of subjects in either group) SOCs affected, were 
infections and infestations (19.4% with CE1226 and 9.2% with placebo), gastrointestinal disorders (11.8% with 
CE1226 and 10.3% with placebo), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (8.6% with CE1226 and 
11.5% with placebo).  
Within the SOC of infections and infestations, medical history PTs present in more than 1 subject in either 
treatment group were: pneumonia (7 subjects in the CE1226 and 1 subject in placebo group), hepatitis A (5 
subjects in the CE1226 and 1 subject in placebo group), hepatitis B (1 subject in the CE1226 and 2 subjects in 
placebo group), and bronchitis (no subjects in the CE1226 and 2 subjects in placebo group). The incidences in 
the remaining SOCs were generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups. 
Concurrent illnesses  
The proportion of subjects with concurrent illnesses was 93.5% in the CE1226 group and 95.4% in the placebo 
group. The majority of subjects in each group had concurrent illnesses that were mild or moderate in severity. 
The proportion of subjects with severe concurrent illnesses was 21.5% in the CE1226 group and 27.6% in the 
placebo group. As expected for the study population, the highest incidence of concurrent illnesses was in the 
SOC of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; the proportion of subjects in this SOC was 63.4% in the 
CE1226 group and 72.4% in the placebo group.

The next most common incidences (≥ 20% of subjects in either group) were in the SOCs of nervous system 
disorders (31.2% with CE1226 and 28.7% with placebo), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (30.1% 
with CE1226 and 24.1% with placebo), gastrointestinal disorders (28.0% with CE1226 and 25.3% with placebo), 
vascular disorders (24.7% with CE1226 and 27.6% with placebo), congenital, familial and genetic disorders 
(21.5% with CE1226 and 16.1% with placebo), and psychiatric disorders (14.0% with CE1226 and 21.8% with 
placebo). The proportion of subjects with concurrent illnesses in the remaining SOCs was less than 20% in both 
groups. 
Prior and/or concomitant medications  
The proportion of subjects with prior medications was 34.4% in the CE1226 group and 33.3% in the placebo 
group. The most frequent prior medications, used by at least 5% of subjects in either group, were hepatitis 
vaccines (5.4% subjects with CE1226 and 8.0% subjects with placebo), selective beta-2-adrenoreceptor 
agonists (7.5% subjects with CE1226 and 3.4% subjects with placebo), glucocorticoids (5.4% subjects with 
CE1226 and 3.4% subjects with placebo), and propionic acid derivatives (2.2% subjects with CE1226 and 5.7% 
subjects with placebo). The proportions of subjects for all remaining classes of prior medications were less than 
5% in both groups.  
The proportion of subjects on concomitant medications was 98.9% in the CE1226 group and 97.7% in the 
placebo group. The most frequent concomitant medications (by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] 
Classification System), used by at least 20% of subjects in either group, were influenza vaccines (54.8% with 
CE1226 and 55.2% with placebo), anilides (54.8% with CE1226 and 49.4% with placebo), glucocorticoids (47.3% 
with CE1226 and 39.1% with placebo), macrolides (39.8% with CE1226 and 39.1% with placebo), selective 
beta-2-adrenoreceptor agonists (35.5% with CE1226 and 36.8% with placebo), propionic acid derivatives (31.2% 
with CE1226 and 39.1% with placebo), combinations of penicillins (including beta-lactamase) (34.4% with 
CE1226 and 34.5% with placebo), fluoroquinolones (33.3% with both CE1226 and placebo), penicillins with 
extended spectrum (34.4% with CE1226 and 29.9% with placebo), natural opium alkaloids (25.8% with CE1226 
and 27.6% with placebo), and adrenergics and other drugs for obstructive airway (23.7% with CE1226 and 27.6%

Post Hoc analysis:  
The primary efficacy analysis was repeated using statistically Adjusted P15 values. In the ITT population, the 
treatment difference for the annual rate of change in statistically Adjusted P15 at the TLC and FRC states 
combined was 0.64 g/L in favour of CE1226 an marginally not statistically significant (1-sided p-value of 0.029). 
The difference in the annual rate of decline in Adjusted P15 of 0.65 g/L in favour of CE1226 at the TLC state was 
statistically significant (p-value of 0.021). The 0.61 g/L difference in favour of CE1226 at FRC state did not 
achieve significance (p-value of 0.068).

Extrapolation of data and clinical relevance of results according to the Applicant 
The importance of the reduced decline in lung density for subjects treated with CE1226 is potentially very high. 
The terminal event for a patient with severe A1-PI deficiency and progressive emphysema is usually death or 
lung transplantation. Within study CE1226_4001, the average lung density based on the last available 
measurement at TLC state for the 5 subjects who died, underwent lung transplantation, or had severe 
respiratory dysfunction, irrespective of treatment group, was just below 20 g/L (n = 5; section 5.3.5.1.1, 
CE1226_4001 CSR, Listing 16.2.6.1,  subjects 5104, 5201, 9107, 1116, and 5105). Using this level of lung 
density as a threshold level, and the observed reduction in alveolar tissue destruction in subjects treated with 
CE1226, the time towards respiratory failure can theoretically be extrapolated. Such a hypothetical calculation 
is shown below in the Table, where the available data for CE1226 are projected over time.  
While acknowledging the limitation of basing this calculation on lung density data from only 5 subjects, this 
example indicates that for subjects treated with CE1226 the time to reach putative terminal respiratory function 
is potentially extended by 5.8 years, representing an approximately 50% increase. CSL Behring therefore 
believes that the results of study CE1226_4001 indicate an important benefit of CE1226 treatment for patients 
with A1−PI deficiency and symptomatic loss of lung function.

Secondary key efficacy endpoints 
  Change in exercise capacity assessed by the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT). 
In the ITT population, the mean distance walked in the exercise capacity test at Day 1 was slightly lower with 
CE1226 (424.5 m [SD: 183.0]) compared with placebo (435.1 m [SD: 199.7]). The mean change from Day 1 to 
Month 24 in the distance walked was lower with CE1226 (10.8 m [SD: 139.8]) compared with placebo (16.1 m 
[SD: 101.6]). In the PP population, the mean change from Day 1 to Month 24 in the distance walked was higher 
with CE1226 (17.7 m [SD: 141.7]) compared with placebo (14.0 m [SD: 103.6]). 
Analysis of the treatment difference for the change from Day 1 to Month 24 for observed values using an 
ANCOVA revealed a change in the distance walked that was 13.1 m in favour of placebo, as compared with 
CE1226 (Table 16). However, this difference was not statistically significant. A similar trend was observed for 
the PP population.

  Change in symptoms assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). 
Higher scores in the SGRQ indicate more limitations in terms of overall health, daily life, and perceived 
well-being in subjects with obstructive airways disease. 
In the ITT population, the mean SGRQ symptoms score with CE1226 (46.5 [SD: 22.7]) and placebo (44.1 [SD: 
24.8]) was comparable at Day 1. The mean change from Day 1 to Month 24 in the SGRQ symptoms score was 
-1.39 (SD: 16.7) with CE1226 and 2.01 (SD: 20.1) with placebo. Similar trends were also seen in the PP 
population. 
Analysis of the treatment difference for the change from Day 1 to Month 24 in SGRQ symptoms score for 
observed values using an ANCOVA revealed a change of 1.11 in favour of CE1226, as compared with placebo. 
However, this difference was not statistically significant. A similar trend was observed for the PP population.

The annual exposure-adjusted incidence rate of exacerbations in the ITT population was 1.70 (95% CI: 1.51 to 
1.89) exacerbations/subject year with CE1226 and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.23 to 1.61) exacerbations/subject year with 
placebo. The annual exposure adjusted incidence rate of exacerbations in the PP population was 1.80 (95% CI: 
1.59 to 2.01) exacerbations/subject year with CE1226 and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16 to 1.55) exacerbations/subject 
year with placebo. Analysis of the treatment difference for the rate of exacerbations per subject year using a 
negative binomial regression model revealed an estimated exacerbation ratio of 1.26 in favour of placebo, as 
compared with CE1226. However, this difference was not statistically significant. A similar trend was observed 
for the PP population. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
  Adjusted P15 change from baseline to Month 24: The change between Adjusted P15 obtained by CT 
scans at baseline and at Month 24. 
The analysis of the treatment difference for the change from baseline to Month 24 in Adjusted P15 was planned 
in the protocol as a secondary efficacy analysis. Analysis of the treatment difference for the change from 
baseline to Month 24 in physiologically Adjusted P15 for observed values using a mixed effects model revealed 
changes ranging from 0.89 to 1.32 g/L and in favor of CE1226, i.e. TLC+FRC: 1.04 g/L (p=0.058, one sided 
p-value), TLC: 1.32 g/L (p=0.028, one sided p-value) and FRC: 0.89 g/L (p=0.115, one sided p-value).  
Similar differences were observed for the PP population, but they did not achieve statistical significance.

Duration of exacerbations 
The mean duration of exacerbations and the mean relative duration of exacerbations (relative to subject’s total 
treatment duration) were slightly higher with CE1226 (0.26 years and 13.8%, respectively) compared with 
placebo (0.18 years and 10.8%, respectively) (see Table above). Similar trends were also seen in the PP 
population. Analysis of the treatment difference for the relative duration of exacerbations using a Wilcoxon rank 
sum test revealed a Hodges-Lehmann estimate for the median difference of 0.56 in favour of placebo, as 
compared with CE1226. This difference was not statistically significant. A similar trend was also seen in the PP 
population (1.37 in favour of placebo), although in this case the treatment difference was statistically significant. 
Hospitalizations due to exacerbations 
The proportion of subjects with no hospitalization due to exacerbations was comparable between CE1226 
(86.0%) and placebo (89.7%). The number of subjects with 1 hospitalization was 10 (10.8%) subjects with 
CE1226 and 5 (5.7%) subjects with placebo; there were no relevant differences in the proportion of subjects 
with 2, 3, or > 3 hospitalizations between the 2 groups.  
Table 22- Number of hospitalizations due to exacerbations (frequencies) (ITT population) 
Source: CSR CE1226_4001 
The proportions of subjects requiring hospitalization due to exacerbations were comparable between the 2 
groups in every quarterly visit interval. Similar trends were also generally seen in the PP population. 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of hospitalizations due to exacerbations in the ITT population was 0.11 
hospitalizations/subject year with both CE1226 and placebo. Similar results were also seen in the PP population. 
The mean duration of hospitalizations and the mean relative duration of hospitalizations due to exacerbations 
(relative to subject’s total treatment duration) were 0.04 years and 6.22%, respectively, with CE1226 and 0.02 
years and 2.16%, respectively, with placebo (see table above). Similar trends, but with smaller treatment 
differences, were seen in the PP population. Analysis of the overall treatment difference using different statistical 
models for the relative duration of hospitalization, for the number of hospitalizations due to exacerbations, and 
for the number of subjects requiring hospitalization due to exacerbations showed no statistically significant 
differences between the 2 treatment groups in the ITT or PP populations. 
Antibiotic treatment for exacerbations 
The mean duration of antibiotic treatment and the mean relative duration of antibiotic treatment for 
exacerbations (relative to subject’s total treatment duration) were comparable for CE1226 (0.03 years and

also seen in the PP population. 
The proportion of subjects requiring antibiotic treatment for exacerbations were generally higher with CE1226 
compared with placebo in the quarterly visit intervals; proportion during these intervals ranged between 21.5% 
and 32.3% with CE1226, and between 17.2% and 24.1% with placebo (See Table below). A similar trend was 
also seen in the PP population.

At Month 24, the mean plasma antigenic A1-PI level was 0.73 mg/mL (SD: 0.17), median 0.71, range 0.34-1.20 
mg/mL with CE1226 and 0.27 mg/mL (SD: 0.11), median 0.24, range 0.18-0.95 g/ml, with placebo. The mean 
change from Day 1 to Month 24 was 0.46 mg/mL (SD: 0.16) with CE1226 and -0.00 mg/mL (SD: 0.06) with 
placebo. For the functional A1-PI trough levels at Month 24, the mean level was 0.51 mg/mL (SD: 0.14) with 
CE1226 and 0.13 mg/mL (SD: 0.07) with placebo. The mean change from Day 1 to Month 24 was 0.38 mg/mL

Source; Summary Clinical Efficacy, 
Clinical relevance of the efficacy results in study CE1226_4001 
Lung loss measured via whole lung CT densitometry, i.e. the 15th percentile point, is a physiological endpoint 
used in clinical A1-PI augmentation therapy studies. CT densitometry has previously been accepted by the CHMP 
as an acceptable method to detect progression of emphysema in patients with A1-PI deficiency. It is agreed that 
“TLC” inspirations state is the most suitable endpoint to use in studies since it has the best possibility to detect 
small differences in lung density. Thus, lung density measured at the “TLC” inspiration state is a relevant 
parameter to use as it measures the physiological change in the organ which is affected of the disease.

The nearly significant efficacy results for the pre-defined primary analysis of “TLC/FRC combined” supported by 
the result of the analysis of “TLC only” having a nomial p-value less than 0.05 support the evidence of effect, i.e. 
of a reduction of the rate of lung density decline. The data was also reanalysed using the mixed effects model 
repeated measures model used by Stolk (2007) and this method gave p=0.001 for the treatment difference 
when analysing “TLC/FRC combine”. Hence, supporting the primary analysis.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI, company code CE1226), also known as 
alpha1-antitrypsin, is supported by one completed phase 3 study (CE1226_4001) and one ongoing study 
(CE1226_3001, interim analysis) for the final claimed indication “Respreeza is indicated for maintenance 
treatment, to slow the progression of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor 
deficiency (ie, serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels <11 µM or phenotypes PiZZ, PiZ(null), Pi(null,null), 
PiSZ). 
Patients are to be under optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment and show evidence of 
progressive lung disease (eg, lower forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) predicted, impaired walking 
capacity or increased number of exacerbations) as evaluated by a healthcare professional experienced in the 
treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.” 
Study CE1226_4001 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase III/IV study to 
compare the efficacy and safety of 60 mg/kg body weight of CE1226 weekly i.v. administration with placebo 
weekly i.v. administration. The study duration was 24 months. The use of placebo as the comparator arm is 
supported. Completion of the study took more than six years, lasting from March 2006 to September 2012. 
Starting in April 2008 an open-label extension study (CE1226_3001) was set up. Study CE1226_3001 is still 
ongoing, and is an open-label, non-controlled, multicenter, multinational study. Subjects who had completed 
the 2-year treatment and observation period in the CE1226_4001 study, except those participating in the USA, 
were invited to participate in study CE1226_3001 now solely with active treatment.  All subjects are planned to 
be treated with weekly intravenous administrations of CE1226 at a dose of 60 mg/kg b.w. for up to 24 months. 
Those subjects who had already been allocated to receive CE1226 treatment during study CE1226_4001 
represent the ”Early Start” group and will have received up to 48 months of continuous therapy at the end of 
study CE1226_3001. Subjects who received placebo in study CE1226_4001 and only began to receive CE1226 
treatment upon entry into study CE1226_3001 represent the “Delayed Start” group and will have a maximal 
exposure of 24 months at the end of study CE1226_3001. This study is awaited to be finished in September 
2015 and is included in the RMP.  
The Applicant has performed a second interim analysis of study CE1226_3001 with a cut-off date of 31 
December 2013. The data now includes 97 subjects who have completed the study in contrast to 65 subjects 
who were included in the first interim analysis.

The study populations consist of male and female A1-PI deficient subjects (serum A1-PI levels < 11 μM, or < 50 
mg/dL as determined by nephelometry), non-smokers, with emphysema and reduced lung function, with forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 35% and ≤ 70% predicted. A recommendation to restrict A1-PI therapy 
to subjects with moderate airflow obstruction is supported by data of Seersholm (Seersholm et al. 1997), who 
stratified subjects by initial FEV1% predicted showing a significant effect of treatment only in the group of 
patients with an initial FEV1% predicted of 31-65%. The same is reflected in the statement of the American 
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (2003) which states that benefits of augmentation therapy in 
individuals with severe (e.g. FEV1 ≤35% predicted) or mild (e.g. FEV1 ≥50-60% predicted) airflow obstruction 
are less clear. Subpopulation analysis with regards to the FEV1 was not concluded at the end in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC, but rather to show evidence of progressive lung disease (e.g. lower forced expiratory volume per second 
(FEV1) predicted, impaired walking capacity or increased number of exacerbations) as evaluated by a healthcare 
professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. 
The time points for evaluation of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints were 3, 12, 21, and 24 
months in study CE1226_4001 and 12 and 24 months in study CE1226_3001. The primary objective in both 
studies was to investigate the effect of CE1226 on the progression of emphysema, assessed by the decline of 
lung density, measured by CT. 
The primary efficacy variable was the lung volume-adjusted lung density (Adjusted P15) estimated by the 15th 
percentile of the frequency histogram of the lung pixels. Lung loss measured via whole lung CT densitometry, 
i.e. the 15th percentile point, is a physiological endpoint used in clinical A1-PI augmentation therapy studies. CT 
densitometry has previously been accepted by the CHMP as an acceptable method to detect progression of 
emphysema in patients with A1-PI deficiency. It is agreed that “TLC” inspirations state is the most suitable 
endpoint to use in studies since it has the best possibility to detect small differences in lung density. Thus, lung 
density measured at the “TLC” inspiration state is a relevant parameter to use as it measures the physiological 
change in the organ which is affected of the disease.   
The used primary endpoint in the clinical study CE1226_4001 the “Lung volume-adjusted lung density (Adjusted 
P15) estimated by the 15th percentile of the frequency histogram of the lung pixels” is a complex endpoint since 
it not only includes CT scans at different inspiration states, TLC and FRC, but also combines the different 
inspiration states (TLC+FRC, TLC, FRC) and uses two methods to standardise density values for total lung 
volume (physiological and statistical). In the primary efficacy analysis the physiological adjustment (Adjusted 
P15 = observed P15 x (observed mTLV/predicted TLC)) was used for the analysis for “TLC and FRC combined”, 
“TLC” and “FRC” inspirations states. The inclusion of only the “TLC” inspiration state” seems the most suitable 
endpoint for future studies. 
A large number of secondary endpoints were included in the study and during the study the objectives have 
been clarified and the ranking of them have been altered during the study. However, no formal statistical 
hierarchical ranking has been performed. Among the secondary endpoints FEV1, exacerbations, and antigenic 
and functional A1-PI plasma levels are considered most relevant when considering the disease. 
A GCP inspection performed by the Irish Medicines Board on the 13th to 16th December 2011 identified critical 
and major deficiencies at the Professor McElvaney, Ireland, centre (studies CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001). 
Satisfactory responses to its findings have been provided.  
Respreeza is approved by the FDA since 2003. The pivotal studies (4001 and 3001) for the current EU 
application was also submitted to the FDA as an efficacy supplement along with an application for an extended 
indication. In this context, the FDA performed a GCP inspection of 4 study sites. The inspection report (July 2014) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 76/102 
 
  
  
identified some GCP departures which was communicated to the company September 2014 and the FDA 
concluded that the studies were not adequate to consider for supporting the requested new application.  
The Applicant has acknowledged that during the course of the CE1226_4001 study, there were GCP departures. 
Many of the issues identified by the FDA inspectors were identified by CSLB/contract research organizations 
(CROs) during routine study monitoring, review of monitoring reports, and/or during CSLB quality assurance 
audits. In addition, an independent clinical quality assurance has been performed. Following identification of 
issues, related corrective measures/actions were implemented, including process updates, training, and site 
communications. For those topics that could have potentially impacted the integrity of the clinical data, the 
Applicant has demonstrated that the corrective actions applied during the course of the studies did positively 
impact the overall GCP compliance. The main concerns were inability to verify that subjects received the correct 
active or placebo investigational medicinal product and issues referring to dosing irregularities as well as issues 
related to blinding of the IMP.  
The Applicant’s has submitted their responses to the inspection findings in the response to the Day 180 
outstanding issues and has provided additional clarifications in subsequent responses. During an oral 
explanation at the CHMP, the applicant clearly justified, from a GCP perspective that the pivotal studies for the 
MAA, inspected by the FDA in July 2014 and previously for one site by the Irish medicines Board 2011 are 
adequate to support an approval. The CHMP concluded that the GCP findings would not influence the results of 
the studies in a way that the B/R of the product could be affected.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the ITT population the majority of the patients were Caucasian with approximately equal numbers of females 
and males. The age ranged from 31 to 67 years in study CE1226_4001 and from 33 to 69 in study CE1226_3001. 
As far as available, the Applicant provided information regarding smoking history from most of the study 
subjects. No relevant differences were found between the two treatment groups with regard to smoking history. 
The dosing regime in both studies was 60 mg /kg b.w once weekly. Approximately 80% of the subjects in the 
study received a 120 mg/kg dose, although, the total exposure of the 120 mg/kg dose was low and roughly 
corresponds to 4 weeks exposure for the concerned 75 subjects. Thus, there is limited safety data for the 120 
mg/kg dose. 
The predefined primary statistical analysis, i.e. assessing the annual rate of change in lung density, using 
physiologically Adjusted P15 at “TLC and FRC states combined“ in a mixed effects model, resulted in a difference 
in the annual rate of decline in Adjusted P15 of 0.62 g/L in favour of CE1226 (p = 0.029, one sided p-value). In 
study CE1226_4001, the annual rate of change in lung density, using physiologically Adjusted P15 using only 
the total lung capacity “TLC” state in a mixed effects model, rendered a difference of 0.74 g/L (p=0.017, one 
sided p-value) in favour of CE1226 in study CE1226_4001. The documented difference in decline of the lung 
density between CE1226 and placebo treatment indicate that CE1226 has an effect on this parameter.  The 
observed value is slightly lower but is of the same magnitude as the observed value of 0.86 g/L/year in the 
EXACTLE study (Dirksen et al, 1999). 
The nearly significant efficacy results for the pre-defined primary analysis of “TLC/FRC combined” supported by 
the result of the analysis of “TLC only” having a nominal p-value less than 0.05 support the evidence of effect, 
i.e. of a reduction of the rate of lung density decline. The data was also reanalysed using the mixed effects model 
repeated measures model used by Stolk (2007) and this method gave p=0.001 for the treatment difference 
when analysing “TLC/FRC combine”. Hence, supporting the primary analysis. The Applicant has performed both 
a priori and post hoc sensitivity analyses to evaluate whether baseline differences in lung density between the 
treatment groups have driven the direction of primary efficacy variable outcomes, consistently favouring 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 77/102 
 
  
  
CE1226 over placebo, or have a profound impact on the magnitude of effect. To explore this question, sensitivity 
analyses of the primary endpoint were completed with baseline lung density as a covariate. Overall the results 
were similar to the primary analysis and their impact on the results was negligible. Thus, a decline in lung loss, 
measured via whole lung CT densitometry using TLC state, is observed for the CE1226 treated arm compared to 
the placebo arm. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints in study CE1226_4001, very slight trends in favour of CE1226 for FEV1, 
DLco, ISWT and total SGRQ are seen although a negative trend for rates and proportion of severe exacerbations 
is observed. The results may not be unexpected since the study CE1226_4001 was not large enough or long 
enough to detect differences in secondary endpoints. The subjects were further permitted to use concomitant 
respiratory medications without any restriction and there were some differences between the two arms. 
Furthermore, it seems that the subjects in the CE1226 arm had a more severe disease when compared to the 
placebo arm, i.e. lung density at TLC state values were 45.5 vs 48.9 g/L for the CE1226 and placebo groups, 
respectively, which could possibly affect the results. Overall, it has to be concluded that there is no support from 
secondary endpoints. 
The Applicant has performed a second interim analysis of study CE1226_3001 with a cut-off date of 31 
December 2013. The data now includes 97 subjects who have completed the study in contrast to 65 subjects 
who were included in the first interim analysis. The subjects treated with placebo had an annual rate of decline 
of -2.06 g/L/year and when switched over to receive CE1226 (Delayed start group), the annual rate of decline 
was -1.31 g/L/year.  This is similar to the value seen in study CE1226_4001 where the annual rate of decline was 
-1.37 for subjects treated with CE1226 (Early start group). The annual rate of decline is -1.08 g/L/year 
treatment year 3-4 in the subjects who received CE1226 from the beginning (including year 1-2; Early start 
group). Overall, the new interim analysis data for study CE1226_3001 support the results observed in study 
CE1226_4001.  
In the study CE1226_4001 study the A1-PI concentrations were measured at the end of a dosing period and are 
trough concentrations. The mean trough concentrations in the CE1226 group in the CE1226_4001 was 
approximately 16 µM (11-23 µM, 90 % prediction interval). In addition, the Applicant has developed a 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) model and estimated the average serum A1-PI concentration throughout a 
dosing interval to be in the order of 19 to 20 μM in study CE1226_4001 which is in the lower range of normal.  
To summarise, the pre-specified primary endpoint (TLC/FRC combined) did not reach statistical significance, 
however, was close to doing so. The analysis of CT in TLC, the full inspiration state, demonstrated a statistically 
significant difference to placebo, accompanied by a consistent result in FRC at resting expiration. The Applicant 
provides published evidence that TLC is the less variable and therefore most robust inspiration state to follow 
changes in lung tissue, and more sensitive to detect small changes. It is therefore regarded acceptable to 
consider the results of CT measurements at TLC state as the primarily relevant ones. Thus, a decline in lung loss, 
measured via whole lung CT densitometry using TLC state, is observed for the CE1226 treated arm compared to 
the placebo arm. 
The mean trough A1-PI concentrations in the CE1226 group in the CE1226_4001 was approximately 16 µM 
(11-23 µM, 90 % prediction interval) and the estimated average serum A1-PI concentration throughout a dosing 
interval is in the order of 19 to 20 μM which is in the lower range of normal. 
In the performed pivotal study, the mean trough A1-PI concentrations in subjects receiving Respreeza was 
approximately 16 µM (11-23 µM, 90 % prediction interval) and the estimated average serum A1-PI 
concentration throughout a dosing interval is in the order of 19 to 20 μM which is in the lower range of normal.

Thus, it has been shown that treatment increases serum levels but it should be noted that the relationship 
between achieved serum level and clinical effect on lung density is currently not known. 
Furthermore, CHMP has agreed on a randomized, long-term PAES as recommended by the expert panel to study 
the dose-relationship if the higher API levels achieved in the blood might influence the rate of lung density 
decline and whether that would support an increased dose of 120mg/kg based on scientific observation of the 
population treated that previous efficacy evaluations might not have covered in population with higher rate of 
exacerbations. 
The Applicant has in response to a raised question regarding the initially proposed post authorisation study  
committed to conduct a randomized, long term, high/low dose study that will evaluate the effect of a high dose 
(120 mg/kg) as both a routine therapy as well as an up-titration regimen for those subjects whose lung density 
decline persists above 2 g/L/y following administration of 60 mg/kg therapy as a post authorisation commitment. 
The preliminary outlined study begins with a run-in period followed by a randomized treatment period (60 
mg/kg, 120 mg/kg) with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the two doses. This is strongly 
endorsed. The Applicant proposes that following the treatment period, subjects who are persistent fast decliners, 
will be up-titrated in a blinded manner. All aspects of the study need to be thoroughly discussed and a 
centralised scientific advice regarding the study design is recommended. The CHMP endorses the Applicant’s 
commitment to seek centralised scientific advice regarding the study design. 
Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened in the context of the ongoing assessment of the 
Respreeza(human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor) application for marketing authorisation in the EU as requested 
by the CHMP during the November 2014 plenary meeting and took place on the 14 January 2015. The 
conclusions were the following: 
Question 1.  
What is the strength of the available evidence (e.g. data from registries, published clinical trial data, 
Cochrane review from 2010) supporting efficacy of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI) 
replacement therapy in slowing the destruction of lung tissue that leads to emphysema in adults 
with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency and clinically evident lung disease? 
The experts agreed that there is a consistent effect of i.v. A1-PI(H) augmentation therapy on lung density 
demonstrated across clinical trials; however, there is a lack of robust evidence that this translates into a 
clinically relevant effect. 
Published clinical studies on the efficacy are overall non-conclusive of the overall efficacy The experts referred to 
several publications, including a prospective study from Wencker et al. in 1998 showing that the decline in FEV1 
was slowed by i.v. A1-PI treatment compared to historical data, and a study from Stockley et al in 2013, in which 
pooling the results of two previous small trials on replacement therapy showed a statistically significant 
reduction in the loss of CT but with no difference in the FEV1 favouring the treatment. In 2010 a Cochrane report 
[Gotsche, 2010] recommend against A1-PI therapy on the grounds of lack evidence of clinical benefit.  
Correlation of CT-measured lung density with functional and patient-reported outcomes in A1-PI deficiency was 
reviewed in several studies, with exercise capacity [Dowson 2001], lung function measures, including FEV1, 
FEV1/FVC, and DLCO [Gould 1991, Kinsella 1990], and health status indices [Dowson, 2001] correlating 
variably with CT density Dirksen in 2009 showed a longitudinal correlation between decline in lung density and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 79/102 
 
  
  
 
 
decline in FEV1, but not with DLCO or SGRQ, over a period of 30 months. The variability of the correlation of 
functional endpoints with CT in baseline conditions and as parameters of progression of the disease is due to a 
number of reasons including the different pathogenetic drivers of the changes in indices of airflow limitation 
(FEV1) vs. indices of emphysema, the latter better reflected by CT densitometry (ref). The measurement of gas 
transfer parameters such as DLCO is subject to large longitudinal variability. 
In conclusion, the expert panel agreed that there remains uncertainty how lung density decline rate translates 
into clinically relevant effect. This is compounded by the fct that individuals with severe AT defriciancy decline at 
different rates, with some developnig significant and progressive lung disease and others not. 
It is likely though that augmentation therapy has an effect on emphysema. Experts expressed also the view that 
this uncertainty is to remain as it is not possible to solve the question through feasible clinical trials particularly 
due to high variability of clinical outcome measures, as discussed above. The experts noted that the impact on 
the beneficial clinical effect might be influenced due to the late diagnosis of patients. On the other hand there 
might be an opportunity on the assessment of relevant clinical benefit in specific subpopulations, such as fast 
decliners (in density and/or lung function) vs. slow decliners.  
Question 2.  
What is the strength of the available evidence that A1-PI concentration in the serum is a surrogate 
for clinical efficacy? Is a A1-PI concentration threshold of 11 µM sufficiently justified considering 
that the normal range for healthy subjects is between 20-53 µM? 
The expert panel concurred serum A1-PI concentration is being used as a surrogate endpoint (biological) of 
efficacy. This is not demonstrated directly in relation to levels of A1-PI reached by replacement treatment but on 
the published literature that has shown a higher risk of developing emphysema due to A1-PI deficiency with 
lower A1-PI serum levels and genotype PiZZ. 
The experts noted that the 11 μM threshold is primarily based on publications by Eriksson that showed 
individuals with endogenous serum A1-PI concentrations below 11 μM manifest a significantly increased risk for 
development of emphysema above the general population background risk [Eriksson 1964, Eriksson 1965]. 
There is no further significant support for this threshold. As not all subjects with lower than average A1-PI serum 
levels will develop emphysema, current recommendations from the ATS/ERS 2003 and the CTS 2012 
recommend treatment with A1-PI augmentation therapy to individuals with A1-PI serum concentrations <11 μM 
presenting with clinical signs of lung function decline.  
Historically this target has been translated into a dosing of 60 mg/kg BW. However, the experts unanimously 
agreed that there would be a benefit to conduct further clinical studies to investigate whether some patients 
would benefit from higher doses. 
Question 3.  
What is the clinical relevance of lung density measurements as a parameter of clinical efficacy? Do 
the efficacy results in studies CE1226_4001 and 3001 with respect to lung density measurements 
(taking into account imbalances between the two treatment groups in the lung density at baseline) 
establish a clinically relevant effect? 
The experts panel agreed that lung density measurements by CT scan have been used since the 1980s and is the 
most sensitive-to-change endpoint in emphysema and uniquely suitable as a clinical study endpoint due to its 
direct and validated representation and quantification of the anatomical changes underlying this condition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 80/102 
 
  
  
 
 
The Applicant has undertaken a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (CE1226_4001 and 3001) 
to assess the impact of A1-PI augmentation therapy over 24 (to 48 in the extended trial) months in subjects with 
emphysema secondary to severe A1-PI deficiency. In this study, the expert panel agreed that A1-PI 
augmentation showed slowing the decline in lung density as a surrogate of progressive destruction of the lung 
parenchyma in emphysema, measured by the CT lung density decline. The expert panel agreed the data 
includes heterogeneous population mixing rapid decliners in lung density compared to slow decliners and 
therefore the evidence of clinical emphysema lung density decline rate in non-smokers might not be clear, which 
is not unexpected. However, from the clinical trials indirect conclusions can be drawn on clinical benefit on 
emphysema through the lung density measurements. 
The expert panel also confirmed the validity of the CT density measurements performed at TLC (Total Lung 
capacity) since they ensure a much lower variability than the scans taken at FRC (Functional residual capacity). 
In this respect, the experts also confirmed the plausibility of the changes in primary endpoint from the density 
measured at TLC and FRC scans to the density measured on scans acquired at TLC.  
Question 4.  
In study 4001, no beneficial effect was documented for clinical endpoints (e.g. effect on the 
functional lung parameters and clinical symptoms like exacerbations). Is demonstration of effect 
on such endpoints required to establish a clinically relevant effect of the treatment in question? 
The expert panel agreed that the pivotal trial design (with regards to size and duration) was not powered to 
detect an effect on either lung function or the rate and severity of exacerbations. 
The expert panel point of view is that assessment of lung function, i.e., FEV1, FEV1 % predicted, FVC, FEV1/FVC 
and Dlco, as well as exacerbations are not evidence in the degree/decline of lung tissue. 
Overall however, the view expressed by several experts was that no further data would be required to be 
convinced that at least some selected patients would derive clinical relevant effects from the treatment. For 
details of such patient population see response to question 6. 
Question 5.  
On which of the endpoints discussed in questions 2 – 4 above an effect would have to be 
demonstrated, as a minimum, to conclude that the effect provided by treatment in question is 
clinically relevant. 
The expert panel agreed that clinically relevant effect of augmentation therapy would have to demonstrate an 
elevation of the mean trough serum A1 PI level in subjects to above 11 μM and a reduction of the rate of lung 
density decline as measured by CT scan. Physiological measures such as 6 min walking test as well as health 
status indices with the SGQR (St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire and Short Form-36) [Dowson 2001b] 
could be considered as secondary endpoints. 
No minimum pre-defined lung density decline rate by g/l/yr measured by CT scan was considered as endpoints 
to demonstrate a clinical relevant effect. Mortality-related endpoints have been proven non-realistic even in 
trials non- A1 PI deficient COPD with thousands of patients, and are therefore even less an option in a disease 
as rare as A1 PI deficiency.

Question 6.  
What would be the appropriate target population in clinical practice for alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor 
replacement therapy, especially regarding the patient´s phenotype, severity of the disease and 
level of lung obstruction? 
The expert panel agreed that the appropriate target population in clinical practice for alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor 
replacement therapy would be patients presenting with a combination of risk factors: 
 
 
 
 
 Significant lung density decline, 
severity of emphysema,  
deficient/low level of A1PI concentration, below 11 μM 
phenotype/genotype.at risk 
The expert panel agreed not to be too restrictive on lung function (FEV1) in the target population and specifically 
not to define a lower cut-off; the treatment recommendations from the Canadian Thoracic Society in 2012 
recommending treatment for patients whose FEV1 is between 25 and 80 percent of predicted and/or a diffusing 
capacity below 70% of predicted were noted. 
The expert panel concurred that specialist centres should establish the treatment of an individual patient as the 
decision on treatment needs to be individual and currently it is not possible to define any exact criteria. It is 
necessary to identify factors predicting natural course and outcome of treatment that could be used in future 
clinical practice. 
The experts suggested that the patients assumed to benefit from the treatment, i.e. the therapeutic indication 
population should be defined by both the threshold of serum A1-PI <11 μM AND having a phenotype/genotype 
associated with severe deficiency, risk of progression based on phenotype, decline when non smoking severtiy 
of emphsyema at diagnosis, presence of pther co-morbidities affectiung longevity and symptoms 
Additional comments from the ad-hoc expert group: 
The expert panel strongly supported the need to conduct further studies e.g. using also data from national 
registries of A1-AP deficiency and the AIR international registry. The scope of post-authorization studies 
includes establishing whether the serum levels of API have an influence in the lung density decline, and establish 
a dose-relationship if the higher API levels achieved in the blood might influence the rate of lung density decline 
and whether that would support an increased dose. 
Furthermore, using the existing study data for the product the experts recommended to perform sensitivity 
analysis to identify potential confounding factors for clinical response (like fast vs. slow decliners, A1-PI 
pharmacokinetics, severity of emphysema). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, it is agreed that augmentation therapy increases the plasma A1-PI concentrations above 11 µM as 
intended in subjects with emphysema with evidence of progressive lung disease The achieved A1-PI through 
level in the study CE1226_4001 were 16 µM and the average serum A1-PI concentration throughout a dosing 
interval was estimated to be in the order of 19 to 20 μM which is in the lower range of normal.  
A statistical significant decline in lung loss, measured via whole lung CT densitometry using “TLC” state, is 
observed for the CE1226 treated arm compared to the placebo arm.

The clinical relevance of the magnitude of the effect on lung density seen with CE1226, difference of 0.74 
g/L/year compared to placebo, was thoroughly discussed at an ad hoc expert meeting (14 January 2015).  The 
experts concluded that it is considered likely that augmentation therapy has an effect on emphysema, although, 
uncertainty remains how lung density decline rate translates into clinically relevant effect. Experts expressed 
also the view that this uncertainty is to remain as it is not possible to solve the question through feasible clinical 
trials particularly due to high variability of clinical outcome measures, as discussed above. The experts noted 
that the impact on the beneficial clinical effect might be influenced due to the late diagnosis of patients. On the 
other hand there might be an opportunity on the assessment of relevant clinical benefit in specific 
subpopulations, such as fast decliners (in density and/or lung function) vs. slow decliners. 
At the ad hoc expert meeting the expert panel concurred serum A1-PI concentration is being used as a surrogate 
endpoint (biological) of efficacy. This is not demonstrated directly in relation to levels of A1-PI reached by 
replacement treatment but on the published literature that has shown a higher risk of developing emphysema 
due to A1-PI deficiency with lower A1-PI serum levels and genotype PiZZ. The expert panel agreed that clinically 
relevant effect of augmentation therapy would have to demonstrate an elevation of the mean trough serum A1 
PI level in subjects to above 11 µM and a reduction of the rate of lung density decline as measured by CT scan.  
In this respect the results in the CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001 extension studies have provided these two 
requisites since reassuring level of A1-PI concentrations were achieved and a statistically significant difference in 
lung density decline between CE1226 and placebo treatment, measured at full inspiration, was observed. The 
magnitude of the effect on lung density seen with CE1226, difference of 0.74 g/L/year compared to placebo, is 
of the same magnitude as reported in other studies (Dirksen 1999, 2009). 
The Applicant has made several attempts to address the possible clinical relevance of the observed effects in the 
pivotal study. The Applicant has conducted a new post-hoc analysis to evaluate longitudinal Pearson’s 
correlations between lung density decline and FEV1 decline based on the preliminary 4-year data from studies 
CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001 extension (analyses performed with data available in January 2015). The 
results indicate a moderate correlation between the change in lung density and the change in FEV1 at 48 months. 
The potential correlation of CT-measured lung density with functional and patient-reported outcomes in A1-PI 
deficiency has been reviewed in several studies. In two studies (Dirksen in 2009, Parr 2006) a correlation 
between decline in lung density and decline in FEV1 over a period of 30-36 months was observed. Thus, there is 
some support for a clinical relevant effect expressed as a reduced worsening of FEV1 in connection with reduced 
decline in lung density.  
The Applicant has moreover discussed the correlation between mortality and decline in lung-density. The results 
from both the NHLBI registry (Dawkins 2009), and UK registry studies (Stockley, to be published) are presented 
again. Overall these data indicate that the rate of lung density decline measured by CT densitometry is strongly 
associated with mortality risk among those patients with FEV1 values between 30% and 50% of predicted. This 
unpublished data has to be interpreted carefully, but a more rapid regression of lung density is detrimental for 
the patient. This is also supported in a publication by Dawkins 2009. Although, the data is not providing any 
direct evidence with respect to the beneficial effect of the magnitude of the effect on lung density seen with 
treatment with CE1226. 
Furthermore, the Applicant has made an attempt to provide a clinical context of this magnitude of difference, by 
projected the length of time that it would take patients starting with the average lung density observed in study 
CE1226_4001 (approximately 45 g/L) to reach a theoretical terminal lung density level, which in this study 
corresponded to approximately 20 g/L based on whether they received augmentation therapy or not. This 
hypothetical calculation suggests that the difference approached approximately 6 years longer until patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 83/102 
 
  
  
receiving CE1226 reached this level of lung density compared to those who received placebo. However, there 
are limitations with the performed extrapolation as also acknowledged by the Applicant. 
To conclude, the efficacy of the treatment has been demonstrated as far as it possibly can be achieved. 
Furthermore, CHMP has agreed on a randomized, long-term PAES as an Annex II condition as recommended by 
the expert panel to study the dose-relationship if the higher API levels achieved in the blood might influence the 
rate of lung density decline and whether that would support an increased dose of 120mg/kg based on scientific 
observation of the population treated that previous efficacy evaluations might not have covered in population 
with higher rate of exacerbations. 
The Applicant has in response to a raised question regarding the initially proposed post authorisation study 
committed to conduct a randomized, long term, high/low dose study as an Annex II condition that will evaluate 
the effect of a high dose (120 mg/kg) as both a routine therapy as well as an up-titration regimen for those 
subjects whose lung density decline persists above 2 g/L/y following administration of 60 mg/kg therapy as a 
post authorisation commitment. The preliminary outlined study begins with a run-in period followed by a 
randomized treatment period (60 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg) with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of 
the two doses. This is strongly endorsed. The Applicant proposes that following the treatment period, subjects 
who are persistent fast decliners, will be up-titrated in a blinded manner. All aspects of the study need to be 
thoroughly discussed and a centralised scientific advice regarding the study design is recommended. The CHMP 
endorses the Applicant’s commitment to seek centralised scientific advice regarding the study design. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is based on the 6 clinical studies presented: studies 101 (RPR118635-101), 1002 
(CE1226/2-1002), 201 (RPR118635-201), 2002 (CE1226/2-2002) and the pivotal clinical study (CE1226_4001; 
performed in subjects with A1-PI deficiency and clinical evidence of emphysema) with its extension 
(CE1226_3001). 
Patient exposure 
Across the program a total of 221 unique subjects were treated with A1-PI at a dose of 60 mg/kg or more (6 
patients received 120 mg/kg and 87 received placebo). The demographics of the safety population are 
appropriate to allow for conclusions of safety profile for the population to be treated. Over 90% of subjects had 
the severe ZZ genotype, and most subjects had FEV1 % predicted values of ≤ 70%, indicating that the 
population comprised moderately to severely affected subjects with A1-PI deficiency. They were in average 52 
years old (only 2 were > 65 in the A1-PI treated group). They were predominantly men (58 %) with a normal 
weight span (54 % >BMI 25 and 86 % <30). All were non-smokers.  
The duration of exposure varies between studies. Counted as years of exposure the database is completely 
dominated by the pivotal study CE1226_4001 (2 years) with its extension CE1226_3001 (with a duration of 2 
years at data lock point for the interim analysis). However, the latter does not add information in comparison to 
placebo, as it was single armed. Of the 221 patients totally enrolled, 93 participated in CE1226_4001 and an 
additional 63 (previously treated with placebo) participated in CE1226_3001.  
In an attempt to summarise data from all studies, the applicant has compared the exposure-adjusted incidence 
rates (EAIR) between treatment groups. This EAIR was calculated as the total number of events that occurred 
during the subject exposure time divided by the subject exposure time (in years), which was defined as the sum 
of the total exposure time of all subjects in a treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 84/102 
 
  
  
Adverse events 
Overall, there were 2709 adverse reactions reported in the 221 subjects in the A1-PI group, 1071 in the 87 
subjects in the placebo group. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate was 6.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
6.11, 6.59) with A1-PI and 7.18 (95% CI: 6.76, 7.62) with placebo, thus non-overlapping. The apparent 
difference in EAIR in favour of placebo was however not confirmed by the data from the largest placebo 
controlled study (CE1226_4001). In this study the overall frequency of adverse reactions were comparable 
between groups. The frequency is higher in the A1-PI (CE1226 in the table) group for the most frequent events 
but the numerical difference is small.

CE1226_4001 (so called “early start”) and those who received placebo in that study (so called “delayed start”). 
Active treatment is thus delayed 2 years in the latter group.

Adverse reactions of exploratory interest 
The applicant has defined a number of adverse reactions as of exploratory interest as they are related to the 
drug formulation as such (hypersensitivity events including anaphylactic reaction and hypersensitivity and viral 
transmission).  
For hypersensitivity events the following MedDRA categories (SMQs) were considered: anaphylactic reactions, 
anaphylactic shock and hypersensitivity. There were 180 events recorded in the A1-PI group (0.25 events per 
patient year) and 51 in the placebo group (0.15 events per patient year). During the first 6 months of treatment 
24 % of the patients experience a hypersensitivity reaction in the A1-PI group compared to 16 % in the placebo 
group. These figures include the PTs “cough” and dyspnoea” and thus it is difficult to distinguish between 
symptoms linked to the disease progress as such as adverse reactions from treatment. Upon request, the 
applicant further discussed hypersensitivity. A new search using the criteria SMQs anaphylactic/anaphylactoid 
shock conditions – narrow, anaphylactic reaction – narrow and hypersensitivity - narrow was performed. Data 
were provided expressed as percentage of patients affected for A1-PI and placebo for 6 month and 24 months.

EMA/CHMP/76739/2015

Table 32 Hypersensitivity events study CE1226_3001 
The relevant texts in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated with regards to the results from this 
summary. Hypersensitivity remains the most important identified risks and the applicant made further efforts to 
distinguish, to the extent possible, hypersensitivity reactions manifested in the airways from symptoms of the 
disease to be treated. No signals of such mix were found.   
A1-PI is a human plasma-derived product and therefore inherits the theoretical risk of transmission of 
blood-borne pathogens. There was however no viral safety concern in any of the 6 clinical studies with A1-PI. 
The tests performed included hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis C antibody, HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody, 
hepatitis B core antibody, human immunodeficiency virus type-1/type-2 (HIV-1/-2) antibodies, and sampling 
for potential polymerase chain reaction testing. 
In all 6 clinical studies with A1-PI, subjects were evaluated for A1-PI antibody and immunoglobulin A, and 
immune complex profile C1q binding assay was also evaluated in studies 101, 1002, 201, and 2002. No immune 
complexes or A1-PI antibodies were detected in any subject in any of the clinical studies. 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
Exacerbation of COPD was recorded in 40 out of 221 patients (18.1 %) during the first 6 month of treatment. 
The corresponding figure for placebo is 11/149 (12.6 %). The overall incidence rate was 0.59 and 0.36 events 
per patient year respectively. Based on incidence rate this was the most common adverse reaction in the test 
group with an odds ratio versus placebo of 1.66 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.23). The definition of COPD exacerbation and 
serious COPD exacerbation differs between the safety and the efficacy part of the dossier.  Due to these findings, 
the Applicant was asked to justify their assessment that there would be no increased risk of COPD exacerbations 
with CE1226 treatment. In response, the applicant presented their data as “COPD composite” events thereby 
linking COPD as an adverse reaction with clinical exacerbations. Consistent with the observation in the 
efficacy-part of the dossier it was concluded that the number of COPD exacerbations was not lowered following 
treatment. As COPD is an end stage of the disease to be treated it was unexpected to note that the incidence rate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 87/102 
 
  
  
 
was significantly higher than in the placebo group (0.59 and 0.36 events per patient year respectively; odds 
ratio 1.66 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.23)). This finding is directly linked also to the efficacy of the product. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The incidence rate for serious adverse reactions was similar between groups (0.37 events/patient-year for A1-PI 
and 0.40 for placebo. The most common organ system affected in the test group was respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (0.12 events/patient year in the A1-PI group, and 0.06 in the placebo group, COPD being 
the most prevalent PT. No relevant differences between treatment groups in any other PTs with at least 2 
adverse reactions could be shown. The remaining severe adverse reactions were single occurrences in either 
treatment group. 
Six deaths occurred during the course of the clinical program. Three of the deaths occurred in the placebo group 
(breast cancer metastatic, sepsis, and pneumonia) and 1 in the Prolastin group (respiratory arrest). The two 
deaths that occurred in the CE1226 group were due to respiratory arrest and COPD. 
There were altogether 14 events of neoplasms in the A1-PI group and 7 in the placebo group. The incidence rate 
was similar. Of these 14, 7 were lung neoplasms and the rest a variety of difference types. All lung neoplasms 
were benign. 
For cardiac events the incidence rate was higher for A1-PI than for placebo (0.07 and 0.02 events/patient year 
respectively. The risk ratio was 3.26 [95 % CI: 0.99-10.72). The number of events was (28/437 and 3/149 
events/patient years respectively. A variety of different PTs were recorded. There were 3 records of cardiac 
failure in the A1-PI treated group and none in the placebo group. A search on “Embolic and thrombotic events”, 
found 9 TEAEs in subjects with an exposure duration of at least 6 months (7 events in CE1226, 2 events in 
placebo). All of these TEAEs were causally unrelated apart from 1 TEAE of thrombosis in the CE1226 group. 
Subjects with exposure durations of at least 3 months had 7 thrombotic events in CE1226, 3 thrombotic events 
in placebo group, and with at least 12 months 5 thrombotic events in CE1226, 2 thrombotic events in placebo 
group.  
Laboratory findings 
No integrated analysis of clinical laboratory safety was performed. There were no clinically significant findings 
for haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis or coagulation parameters in either of the single-dose studies. In 
the multiple-dose studies (201 and 2002), A1-PI was similar to Prolastin with respect to the incidence and type 
of test results for these parameters. Since the findings on clinical laboratory safety were minor in the earlier 
studies, haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation parameters were not analyzed in studies 
CE1226_4001 and CE1226_3001. A justification was provided for not investigating clinical laboratory safety in 
the long-term study versus placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
The potential effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors of interest on the safety of A1-PI treatment was assessed by 
examining similarities and differences for incidence rate ratios of A1-PI versus placebo for each subgroup. A 
number of subgroups were analysed (sex, age, genotype, BMI, FEv1 % predicted, A1-PI concentration and 
adjusted P15. No firm conclusions could be drawn from this subgroup analysis. 
Immunological events 
In all 6 clinical studies with A1-PI, subjects were evaluated for A1-PI antibody and immunoglobulin A, and 
immune complex profile C1q binding assay was also evaluated in studies 101, 1002, 201, and 2002. No immune 
complexes or A1-PI antibodies were detected in any subject in any of the clinical studies.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The proportion of subjects with concomitant medications was 96.4% during treatment with A1-PI, 98.9% during 
treatment with placebo, and 87.5% during treatment with Prolastin. The most frequent concomitant 
medications (ie, given to more than 40% of CE1226 subjects) were anilides, glucocorticoids, influenza vaccines, 
and selective beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonists. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were 3 adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment in the CE1226 group and 12 in the 
placebo group. All TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were single occurrences of each PT; the 3 events 
in the CE1226 group were back pain, COPD, and lung transplant. 
Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, since US in July 2003 until July 2013, CSL Behring Global Pharmacovigilance received a total of 
321 reports of AEs spontaneously reported. The majority of reports originated from the US market. The 
cumulative subject exposure in the market setting is estimated as 400,549 doses. 
Overall, 18 fatal reports were received. No causal relationship to the application of A1-PI was reported for these 
cases. In each of the cases, the subject’s underlying disease provided a plausible alternative explanation. 
Of the total 321 reports received, 120 cases were identified using the search criteria to identify potential 
hypersensitivity/allergic/anaphylactic reaction cases. 
Cumulatively, 12 case reports of suspected transmission of infectious agents were received. These cases 
included PTs of influenza, viral upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis viral, viral infection, infectious 
mononucleosis, nosocomial infection, and hepatitis C. The causality to A1-PI for the hepatitis C case was 
assessed as unlikely.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As A1-PI is intended to replace a human protein in deficient patients prominent safety concerns are not expected 
besides possibly reactions related to the infusion itself, hypersensitivity reactions and viral/prion safety and a 
warning to patients is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The studies were relatively small with a total safety 
database of only 221 exposed patients. The applicant has presented a summary analysis of data from all studies 
but due to different treatment durations in different groups and the fact that the extension study CE1226_2003 
included patients who had been placebo treated for two years following diagnosis the figures in this summary 
analysis are uncertain. Anyway, overall it appears as if the overall safety pattern is acceptable with similar rates 
of adverse reactions in the A1-PI treated patients and placebo treated controls. As expected there were cases of 
hypersensitivity reaction, e.g. urticaria at the injections sites (8 cases vs zero in the placebo group). In response 
to the LoQ, the applicant has recalculated their figures but nevertheless a further update was needed to describe 
how often a particular patient is likely to experience hypersensitivity in section 4.8 of the SmPC. To the extent 
possible there should be an attempt to distinguish hypersensitivity reaction manifested in the airways from the 
ongoing disease. The number of cardiovascular events appears somewhat higher in the A1-PI treated patients 
but there are no mechanistic rational for this finding and most events occurred in one single patient. Thrombotic 
and embolic events have been reported as TEAEs, but mainly assessed as causally unrelated to treatment. A 
clearer presentation of the data was presented in response to LoQ showing that there was no increased risk.  
Haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation parameters were only analysed in single dose 
studies and in studies 201 and 2001, both 6 months treatments without comparator or with comparison to 
Prolastin, respectively. The justification provided by the applicant for not investigating clinical laboratory safety 
in the long-term study CE1226_4001 versus placebo was regarded as satisfactory by the CHMP. 
As COPD is an end stage of the disease to be treated it was unexpected to note that the incidence rate was 
significantly higher than in the placebo group (0.59 and 0.36 events per patient year respectively; odds ratio 
1.66 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.23)). This finding is directly linked also to the efficacy of the product. 
Post-marketing data from US does not indicate any specific safety concerns. The table with adverse reactions in 
the SmPC section 4.8 was further discussed with regard to choice of denominator for frequency. CHMP 
concluded that the denominator should be number of subjects and not number of infusions given.

The recommended infusion rate given 
under section 4.2 should be adhered. 
During the first infusions, patient’s clinical 
state, including vital signs, should be 
closely monitored throughout the infusion 
period. If any reaction takes place that 
might be related to the administration of 
Respreeza, the rate of infusion should be

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Alpha1-proteinase  inhibitor (A1-PI)  deficiency,  also  known as  alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency  is a genetic rare 
disorder that manifests as pulmonary emphysema and is characterized by low serum levels of A1-PI, the main 
protease inhibitor (PI) in human serum.  
Respreeza contains human alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, powder and solvent for solution for infusion, 1000 mg, 
and the recommended dose is 60 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously once a week. 
The efficacy of human alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor for the proposed indication of “maintenance treatment, to 
slow the progression of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency 
(e.g.  genotypes  PiZZ,  PiZ(null),  Pi(null,null),  PiSZ).  Patients  are  to  be  under  optimal  pharmacologic  and 
non-pharmacologic  treatment  and  show  evidence  of  progressive  lung  disease  (e.g. lower  forced  expiratory 
volume  per  second  (FEV1)  predicted,  impaired  walking  capacity  or  increased  number  of  exacerbations)  as 
evaluated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency” 
was evaluated for 2-4 years in the pivotal phase III study CE1226_4001 and the extension study CE1226_3001 
(expected Final CSR to be submitted in September 2015). Subjects (non-smokers) with A1-PI deficiency (serum 
A1-PI  levels < 11 μM, or  <  50 mg/dL as determined by  nephelometry) with  emphysema and reduced  lung 
function,  with  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  (FEV1)  ≥  35%  and  ≤  70%  predicted  were  eligible  for 
enrolment into the pivotal study. 
Lung loss measured at total lung capacity (TLC) via whole lung CT densitometry, i.e. the 15th percentile point, 
is considered a relevant endpoint to use as it measures the physiological change in the organ which is affected

of the disease. The documented difference in study CE1226_4001 in decline of the lung density between CE1226 
and placebo treatment (TLC inspiration state: -1.45 g/L/year, -2.19 g/L/year; difference between arms 0.74 
g/L/year (p=0.017, one sided p-value)) show that CE1226 has an effect on this parameter. The results of the 
second interim  analysis of study CE1226_3001 with  a cut-off date of  31  December 2013  support the effect 
observed in study CE1226_4001. The observed value  is slightly lower but is of the same magnitude as  the 
observed value of 0.86 g/L/year measured at “TLC state” in the EXACTLE study (Dirksen et al, 1999).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The results of the functional and patient reported endpoints in study CE1226_4001 showed no clear beneficial 
effects for the patients in the CE1226 arm in comparison to the patients in the placebo arm. The results are not 
unexpected since the study CE1226_4001 was not large enough or long enough, and will be completed with the 
ongoing long-term CE1226_3001in the RMP and  Post authorisation efficacy study in Annex II. The subjects 
were further permitted to use concomitant respiratory medications without any restriction and there were some 
differences between the two arms. Further information on the long-term use wil be provided with the submission 
of the  
The mean trough A1-PI concentrations in the CE1226 group in the CE1226_4001 was approximately 16 µM 
(11-23 µM, 90 % prediction interval) and the estimated average serum A1-PI concentration throughout a dosing 
interval is in the order of 19 to 20 μM which is in the lower range of normal. However, the relationship between 
achieved serum level and effect on lung density is not known. 
The Applicant has committed to conduct a randomized, long term, high/low dose study that will evaluate the 
effect of a high dose (120 mg/kg) as both a routine therapy as well as an up-titration regimen for those subjects 
whose lung density decline persists above 2 g/L/y following administration of 60 mg/kg therapy as a post 
authorisation commitment. The preliminary outlined study begins with a run-in period followed by a randomized 
treatment period (60 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg) with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the two 
doses. The Applicant also commits that following the treatment period, subjects who are persistent fast decliners, 
will be up-titrated in a blinded manner. All aspects of the study need to be thoroughly discussed and a 
centralised scientific advice regarding the study design is recommended. The CHMP endorses the Applicant’s 
commitment to seek centralised scientific advice regarding the study design. Furthermore the CHMP agreed to 
the final report of CE1226_3001to be completed September 2015.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The aim of the treatment is to substitute A1-PI deficient patients and as the level of exposure is not exceeding 
the endogenous level in healthy subjects no adverse reactions related to the protein itself is expected. With 
regard to the general pattern of adverse reactions no specific concerns are raised. The most common adverse 
reactions recorded are either common ailments such as headache (31.2/23.0) and nasopharyngitis (19.4/17.2) 
or symptoms related to the progression of the disease. (Figures in parentheses refer to frequencies expressed 
as percentage recorded in the pivotal study CE1226_4001 for A1-PI and placebo respectively.) 
The frequencies of severe adverse reactions are similar in the groups treated with A1-PI and placebo and there 
are no specific signals pointing at certain areas of concern. 
An important identified risk linked tothe use ofthe product is hypersensitivity and is reflected in the RMP. In the 
pivotal clinical trial CE1226_4001 the overall frequency of hypersensitivity reactions appears rather high (16 % 
for the treatment group and 19 % for placebo) but similar between groups. Furthermore the risk of 
hypersensitivity is reflected in section the 4.4 of the smPC as a special warning and health care professionals 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015

should monitor the patient throughout the infusion rate, and there are limited data regarding the use of this 
medicinal product in home-treatment / self-administration. furthermore in section 4.8 of the SmPC as listed 
undesirable effect. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
With regard to the disease related symptoms these were in some cases more prominent in the group treated 
with A1-PI: COPD exacerbations (22.6/17.2), condition aggravated (20.4/13.8), dyspnoea (12.9/4.6) and 
oropharyngeal pain (11.8/6.9).  
The incidence rate of COPD exacerbations was significantly higher than in the placebo group (0.59 and 0.36 
events per patient year respectively; odds ratio 1.66 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.23).  
The database is relatively small with only 221 exposed subjects. Thus the frequency of adverse reactions other 
than the most common cannot be estimated with any precision. . Healthcare professionals are asked to report 
any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
post-authorisation studies will gather more information with regards to the precision of the undesirable effects. 
Weekly intravenous infusions of a human blood product may carry risks related to the aseptic reconstitution 
technique and the administration technique especially if the product is to be given be self-administration, 
nevertheless this risk is adequately mitigated by information in the product information. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency is a genetic rare disorder that can manifest in symptoms from different 
organs, e.g as pulmonary emphysema. The pathogenesis of the disease is reduced serum levels of A1-PI, the 
main protease inhibitor in human serum. Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor has been developed for 
maintenance treatment with the intention to slow the underlying destruction of lung tissue leading to 
emphysema in adults with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1 PI) deficiency with clinically evident lung disease.  
A statistical significant decline in lung loss, measured via whole lung CT densitometry using “TLC” state, is 
observed for the Respreeza treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The magnitude of the effect is similar to 
previous studies of substitution therapy. It has not been fully documented in clinical studies that a slower rate 
of decline in lung loss translates into clinically relevant outcomes. The clinical relevance of the magnitude of the 
effect on lung density seen with Respreeza was thoroughly discussed at an ad hoc expert meeting and it was 
concluded that in patients with severe disease and high risk of progression of emphysema it is expected that 
treatment with Respreeza will have a beneficial effect. 
The beneficial effect of Respreeza -treated subjects demonstrated a consistent pattern of slower lung density 
decline than those receiving placebo. The annual rate of lung density decline, as measured by CT scan at total 
lung capacity (TLC) over 2 years was lower with Respreeza (-1.45 g/L) as compared with placebo (-2.19 g/L), 
reflecting a 34% reduction (p = 0.017, 1-sided) as described in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The main safety concerns are hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been observed during the treatment. In 
the most serious cases, allergic reactions may progress to severe anaphylactic reactions even when the patient 
has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administrations as described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
In the performed pivotal study, the mean trough A1-PI concentrations in subjects receiving Respreeza was 
approximately 16 µM (11-23 µM, 90 % prediction interval) and the estimated average serum A1-PI 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015 
Page 99/102 
 
  
  
 
concentration throughout a dosing interval is in the order of 19 to 20 μM which is in the lower range of normal. 
Thus, it has been shown that treatment increases serum levels but it should be noted that the relationship 
between achieved serum level and clinical effect on lung density is currently not known. A randomized, 
long-term PAES as an Annex II condition as recommended by the expert panel to study the dose-relationship if 
the higher API levels achieved in the blood might influence the rate of lung density decline and whether that 
would support an increased dose of 120mg/kg based on scientific observation of the population treated that 
previous efficacy evaluations might not have covered in population with higher rate of exacerbations 
No specific safety concerns have arisen in the clinical studies. 
Symptoms related to the progression of the disease (e.g. COPD, condition aggravated and dyspnoea) were 
somewhat more common in patients treated with Respreeza. However, as the subjects in the arm treated with 
Respreeza also had a more severe disease when compared to the subjects in the placebo arm at base line, the 
apparently more rapid progression of the disease in patients treated with Respreeza could be due to imbalance 
at study inclusion. It is also noted that the rate of severe exacerbations appears similar independent of 
treatment.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The effect of human alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor treatment on slowing the decline in lung density in adults with 
documented  severe  alpha1-proteinase  inhibitor  deficiency  is  considered  to  outweigh  the  few  safety  issues 
identified. The benefit risk balance is therefore considered to be positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Respreeza  is  approved  by  the  FDA  since  2003.  The  pivotal  studies  (4001  and  3001)  for  the  current  EU 
application was also submitted to the FDA as an efficacy supplement along with an application for an extended 
indication. In this context, the FDA performed a GCP inspection of 4 study sites. The inspection report (July 
2014) identified some GCP departures which was communicated to the company September 2014 and the FDA 
concluded that the studies were not adequate to consider for supporting the requested new application.  
The Applicant has acknowledged that during the course of the CE1226_4001 study, there were GCP departures. 
Many of the issues identified by the FDA inspectors were identified by CSLB/contract research organizations 
(CROs) during routine study monitoring, review of monitoring reports, and/or during CSLB quality assurance 
audits. In addition, an independent clinical quality assurance has been performed. Following identification of 
issues, related corrective measures/actions were implemented, including process updates, training, and site 
communications. For those topics that could have potentially impacted the integrity of the clinical data, the 
Applicant has demonstrated that the corrective actions applied during the course of the studies did positively 
impact the overall GCP compliance. The main concerns were inability to verify that subjects received the correct 
active or placebo investigational medicinal product and issues referring to dosing irregularities as well as issues 
related to blinding of the IMP.  
The  Applicant’s  has  submitted  their  responses  to  the  inspection  findings  in  the  response  to  the  Day  180 
outstanding  issues  and  has  provided  additional  clarifications  in  subsequent  responses.  During  an  oral 
explanation at the CHMP, the applicant clearly justified, from a GCP perspective that the pivotal studies for the 
MAA, inspected by the FDA in July 2014 and previously for one site by the Irish medicines Board  2011 are 
adequate to support an approval. The CHMP concluded that the GCP findings would not influence the results of 
the studies in a way that the B/R of the product could be affected.  
The  Applicant  has  committed  to  perform,  as  agreed  with  the  CHMP  ,a  randomized,  long-term  PAES  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76739/2015

recommended by the expert panel to study the dose-relationship if the higher API levels achieved in the blood 
might influence the rate of lung density decline and whether that would support an increased dose of 120mg/kg 
based  on  scientific  observation  of  the  population  treated  that  previous  efficacy  evaluations  might  not  have 
covered in particular in populations with frequent exacerbations as described in Annex II.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Respreeza is indicated for maintenance treatment, to slow the progression of 
emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (e.g. genotypes PiZZ, 
PiZ(null), Pi(null,null), PiSZ). Patients are to be under optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment 
and show evidence of progressive lung disease (e.g. lower forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) 
predicted, impaired walking capacity or increased number of exacerbations) as evaluated by a healthcare 
professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency is favourable and therefore

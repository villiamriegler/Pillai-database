NovoSeven (eptacog alfa) 
An overview of NovoSeven and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is NovoSeven and what is it used for? 
NovoSeven is a medicine used to treat  bleeding episodes and to prevent bleeding after surgical 
procedures. It is used in  patients with  the following conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
congenital haemophilia (a bleeding disorder present from birth)  who have developed or are 
expected to develop ‘inhibitors’  (antibodies) against factor VIII or IX; 
acquired haemophilia (a bleeding disease caused by the development of inhibitors  to factor VIII); 
congenital factor VII deficiency; 
•  Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (a rare bleeding disorder), who cannot be treated with  a transfusion 
of platelets (components that help the blood to clot). 
The medicine is also used to treat  patients with  severe postpartum haemorrhage (serious bleeding 
after giving birth), when medicines that stimulate  the muscles of the womb to contract (uterotonic 
medicines) are not effective at controlling the  bleeding. 
NovoSeven contains the active substance eptacog alfa.  
How is NovoSeven used? 
NovoSeven can only be obtained with  a prescription. When used to treat  bleeding episodes or prevent 
bleeding after surgery, treatment  should be started under the supervision of a doctor who has 
experience in the  treatment of haemophilia or bleeding disorders.  
The medicine is available as a powder and solvent that  are made up  into a solution to be injected into 
a vein. The dose depends on the patient’s condition  and body weight and the type of bleed. 
Patients or carers may be able to give NovoSeven themselves after suitable training. For more 
information about using NovoSeven, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or pharmacist.

How does NovoSeven work? 
The active substance in NovoSeven, eptacog alfa, is almost identical to a human protein called 
factor VII and works in the same way. In the body, factor VII is involved in  blood clotting.  It activates 
another factor called factor X, which starts  the clotting  process at the site of the bleed. By activating 
factor X, NovoSeven is able to  help control the  bleeding when the  body’s own clotting  factors are 
reduced, absent, or not working properly. 
Because factor VII acts directly on factor X, independently from factors VIII and IX, NovoSeven can be 
used in patients with  haemophilia who  have developed inhibitors to factor VIII or IX. NovoSeven can 
also be used to replace the missing factor VII in patients with  factor VII deficiency. 
What benefits of NovoSeven have been shown in studies? 
NovoSeven has been studied in patients with  haemophilia and in patients with  factor VII deficiency. 
The main measure of effectiveness was the  number of bleeding episodes that were controlled 
effectively.  
In a study involving 61 patients  with  haemophilia who had developed inhibitors, 84% of the 57  serious 
bleeds and 59%  of the 38  surgical bleeds were controlled effectively with NovoSeven. In another study 
in 60 patients  with  mild to moderate bleeding episodes, which investigated whether NovoSeven could 
be used in the  home setting,  90% of the bleeding episodes were controlled effectively. 
Data on the  use of NovoSeven in patients with  Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia were obtained from a 
registry of patients treated with  the medicine, which showed that treatment  with  NovoSeven was 
successful in 79%  of the bleeding episodes (262  out of 333)  and 88%  of the  surgeries (140 out of 
159). 
NovoSeven has also been studied in  patients with  severe postpartum haemorrhage. When given 
together with  standard care, the medicine was found to be more effective than  standard care alone at 
controlling bleeding, measured by the  need for surgical treatment  to block or tie a bleeding blood 
vessel (embolisation or ligation)  to stop the bleeding. In a study  involving 84 women with  severe 
postpartum haemorrhage whose bleeding could not be controlled with a uterotonic medicine, 50% (21 
out of 42) of women treated with  NovoSeven together with  standard care needed embolisation and/or 
ligation to  stop the bleeding compared with 83%  (35 out of 42) of those given standard care alone.  
What are the risks associated with NovoSeven? 
The most common side effects with  NovoSeven (which may affect up to 1 in  100 patients) are venous 
thromboembolic events (problems caused by blood clots in the veins), rash, pruritus  (itching),  urticaria 
(hives), fever and reduced effectiveness of treatment.  
NovoSeven must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to eptacog alfa, to mouse, 
hamster or cow proteins, or to  any of the other ingredients. 
For the full list  of side effects and restrictions, see the package leaflet. 
Why is NovoSeven authorised in the EU? 
In patients with  bleeding disorders, NovoSeven has been shown to  be effective at  preventing and 
controlling bleeding episodes, including after surgery. In women experiencing severe postpartum 
haemorrhage that cannot be effectively controlled by uterotonic medicines, NovoSeven reduces the

need for surgical procedures to control the  bleeding. The European Medicines Agency therefore decided 
that  NovoSeven’s benefits are greater than  its risks and it  can be authorised in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
NovoSeven? 
Recommendations and precautions to  be followed by healthcare professionals and patients  for the safe 
and effective use of NovoSeven have been included in  the summary of product characteristics and the 
package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of NovoSeven are continuously monitored. Side effects reported 
with  NovoSeven are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.

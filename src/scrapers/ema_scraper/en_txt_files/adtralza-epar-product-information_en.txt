4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Adtralza is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult and adolescent 
patients 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment 
of atopic dermatitis. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of tralokinumab for adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older is an 
initial dose of 600 mg administered either as: 
- 
four 150 mg injections given by pre-filled syringes 
or 
- 
two 300 mg injections given by pre-filled pens 
This initial dose is followed by a 300 mg injection administered every other week either as: 
- 
two 150 mg injections given by pre-filled syringes 
or 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
one 300 mg injection given by pre-filled pen.   
At prescriber’s discretion, every fourth week dosing may be considered for patients who achieve clear 
or almost clear skin after 16 weeks of treatment. The probability of maintaining clear or almost clear 
skin may be lower with every fourth week dosing (see section 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response 
after 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve 
further with continued treatment every other week beyond 16 weeks. 
Tralokinumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. The use of topical corticosteroids, 
when appropriate, may provide an additional effect to the overall efficacy of tralokinumab (see 
section 5.1). Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used, but should be reserved for problem areas 
only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas.  
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be 
resumed at the regular scheduled time. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Limited data are available 
in patients > 75 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. Very limited data are available in 
patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment. Very limited data are available in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
High body weight 
For patients with high body weight (> 100 kg), who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks 
of treatment, reducing the dose to every fourth week might not be appropriate (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of tralokinumab in children below the age of 12 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
The pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen should not be shaken. After removing the pre-filled syringes or 
pre-filled pen from the refrigerator, they should be allowed to reach room temperature by waiting for:  
- 
- 
30 minutes before injecting the pre-filled syringe 
45 minutes before injecting the pre-filled pen. 
Tralokinumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except the 5 cm 
around the navel. If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. 
For the initial 600 mg dose, four 150 mg pre-filled syringes or two 300 mg pre-filled pens should be 
administered consecutively in different injection sites within the same body area. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each dose. Tralokinumab should not be injected into 
skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. 
A patient may self-inject tralokinumab or the patient's caregiver may administer tralokinumab if their 
healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to 
patients and/or caregivers on the administration of tralokinumab prior to use. Detailed instructions for 
use are included at the end of the package leaflet.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity  
If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of tralokinumab 
should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Conjunctivitis 
Patients treated with tralokinumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following standard 
treatment should undergo ophthalmological examination (see section 4.8). 
Helminth infection 
Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. It is 
unknown if tralokinumab will influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting 
IL-13 signalling. 
Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating treatment with 
tralokinumab. If patients become infected while receiving tralokinumab and do not respond to 
antihelminth treatment, treatment with tralokinumab should be discontinued until infection resolves. 
Vaccinations 
Live and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with tralokinumab as clinical 
safety and efficacy have not been established. Immune responses to the non-live tetanus and 
meningococcal vaccines were assessed (see section 4.5). It is recommended that patients should be 
brought up to date with live and live attenuated immunisations in agreement with current 
immunisation guidelines prior to treatment with tralokinumab. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 150 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The safety and efficacy of concurrent use of tralokinumab with live and live attenuated vaccines has 
not been studied. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immune responses to non-live vaccines were assessed in a study in which adult patients with atopic 
dermatitis were treated with an initial dose of 600 mg (four 150 mg injections) followed by 300 mg 
every second (other) week administered as subcutaneous injection. After 12 weeks of tralokinumab 
administration, patients were vaccinated with a combined tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis 
vaccine, and a meningococcal vaccine and immune responses were assessed 4 weeks later. Antibody 
responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal vaccine were similar in tralokinumab-treated and 
placebo-treated patients. No adverse interactions between either of the non-live vaccines or 
tralokinumab were noted in the study. Therefore, patients receiving tralokinumab may receive 
concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations.  
For information on live and live attenuated vaccines, see section 4.4. 
Interactions with cytochrome P450 
Tralokinumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. 
Clinically relevant interactions between tralokinumab and inhibitors, inducers, or substrates of 
metabolising enzymes are not expected, and no dose adjustment is needed. 
The effects of tralokinumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP substrates, caffeine (CYP1A2), 
warfarin (CYP2C9), metoprolol (CYP2D6), omeprazole (CYP2C19) and midazolam (CYP3A), were 
evaluated in atopic dermatitis patients after repeated administration. No effects were observed for 
caffeine and warfarin. Small numerical changes, which were not clinically significant, were observed 
for Cmax of omeprazole, AUC of metoprolol and AUC and Cmax of midazolam (the largest difference 
being for midazolam Cmax with a decrease of 22%). Therefore, clinically relevant impact of 
tralokinumab on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicinal products metabolised by the CYP 
enzymes is not expected. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited amount of data from the use of tralokinumab in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of tralokinumab during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tralokinumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after 
ingestion. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
tralokinumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies did not show any effects on male and female reproductive organs and on sperm count, 
motility and morphology (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tralokinumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (23.4%; mainly reported as 
common cold), injection site reactions (7.2%), conjunctivitis (5.4%) and conjunctivitis allergic (2.0%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions observed from clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by system organ class and 
frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000). Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The 
frequencies are based on the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies in the 
atopic dermatitis population.

Injection site reactions  
The long-term safety of tralokinumab was assessed in 2 monotherapy studies up to 52 weeks, and in 
a combination study with topical corticosteroids up to 32 weeks. The long-term safety of tralokinumab 
is further assessed in an open-label extension study (ECZTEND) for up to 5 years of treatment in 
adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD (atopic dermatitis) receiving 300 mg of 
tralokinumab every two weeks (Q2W). Interim safety data up to 39 months were generally consistent 
with the safety profile observed up to week 16 in the pool of 5 adult studies.  
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Conjunctivitis and related events 
Conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in atopic dermatitis patients who received tralokinumab 
(5.4%) compared to placebo (1.9%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 
5 studies. Conjunctivitis was reported at a higher frequency in patients with severe atopic dermatitis 
compared to subjects with moderate atopic dermatitis in both the tralokinumab group (6.0 vs 3.3%; 
initial treatment period) and placebo group (2.2 vs 0.8%; initial treatment period). Most patients 
recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. 
The rate of conjunctivitis in the interim safety data from the long-term open-label extension study 
(ECZTEND) was 3.37 events/100 patient years of exposure, compared with 22.0 events/100 patient 
years of exposure in the initial 16 weeks treatment period. 
Keratitis was reported in 0.5% of subjects treated with tralokinumab during the initial treatment 
period. Of these, half were classified as keratoconjunctivitis, all were non-serious and mild or 
moderate in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation. 
The rate of keratitis in the interim safety data from the long-term open-label extension study 
(ECZTEND) was 0.15 events/100 patient years of exposure, compared with 1.7 events/100 patient 
years of exposure in the initial 16 weeks treatment period. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eosinophilia 
Adverse reactions of eosinophilia were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with tralokinumab and 
0.3% of patients treated with placebo during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool 
of 5 studies. Tralokinumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in 
eosinophil count compared to patients treated with placebo. Eosinophilia (≥ 5 000 cells/mcL) was 
measured in 1.2% of tralokinumab-treated patients and 0.3% of placebo-treated patients in the initial 
treatment period. However, the increase in the tralokinumab-treated patients was transient, and mean 
eosinophil counts returned to baseline during continued treatment. The safety profile for subjects with 
eosinophilia was comparable to the safety profile for all subjects. 
Eczema herpeticum 
Eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.3% of the subjects treated with tralokinumab and in 1.5% of 
subjects in the placebo group in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies 
in atopic dermatitis. The rate of eczema herpeticum in the initial 16 weeks treatment period was 
1.2 events/100 years of exposure. The rate of eczema herpeticum in the interim safety data from the 
long-term open-label extension study (ECZTEND) was 0.60 events/100 years of exposure. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with tralokinumab. 
Anti-drug-antibody (ADA) responses were not associated with any impact on tralokinumab exposure, 
safety, or efficacy.  
In ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, ECZTRA 3, and the vaccine-response study, the incidence of ADA up to 
16 weeks was 1.4% for patients treated with tralokinumab and 1.3% for patients treated with placebo; 
neutralising antibodies were seen in 0.1% of patients treated with tralokinumab and 0.2% of patients 
treated with placebo. 
The ADA incidence for subjects who received tralokinumab up to 52 weeks was 4.6%; 0.9% had 
persistent ADA and 1.0% had neutralising antibodies. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (including pain and redness) occurred more frequently in patients who received 
tralokinumab (7.2%) compared to placebo (3.0%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in 
the pool of 5 studies. Across all treatment periods in the 5 studies in atopic dermatitis, the vast 
majority (99%) of injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity, and few patients (< 1%) 
discontinued tralokinumab treatment. Most injections site reactions reported had a short duration with 
approximately 76% of the events resolving within 1 to 5 days. 
The rate of injection site reactions in the interim safety data from the long-term open-label extension 
study (ECZTEND) was 5.8 events/100 patient years of exposure, compared with 
51.5 events/100 patient years of exposure in the initial 16 weeks treatment period. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of tralokinumab was assessed in patients 12 to 17 years of age (adolescents) with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in a monotherapy study of 289 adolescents (ECZTRA 6) and in a 
long-term open-label extension study (ECZTEND) including 127 adolescents transferred from 
ECZTRA 6. The safety profile of tralokinumab in these patients followed through the initial treatment 
period of 16 weeks and the long-term treatment period of 52 weeks (ECZTRA 6), as well as in the 
interim safety data from the long-term open-label extension study up to 21 months (ECZTEND) were 
similar to the safety profile from studies in adults. However, a lower frequency of subjects with 
conjunctivitis was observed with tralokinumab in adolescents (1.0%) than in adults (5.4%), and, unlike 
in adults, the frequency of conjunctivitis allergic was similar for tralokinumab and placebo in 
adolescent patients.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific treatment for tralokinumab overdose. In clinical studies with tralokinumab, single 
intravenous doses of up to 30 mg/kg and multiple subcutaneous doses of 600 mg every 2 weeks for 
12 weeks were found to be well tolerated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, Agents for dermatitis, excluding 
corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH07. 
Mechanism of action 
Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the type 2 
cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-13 receptors. Tralokinumab 
neutralises the biological activity of IL-13 by blocking its interaction with the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα 
receptor complex. IL-13 is a major driver of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic 
dermatitis and inhibiting the IL-13 pathway with tralokinumab in patients decreases many of the 
mediators of type 2 inflammation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In clinical trials, treatment with tralokinumab resulted in reduced levels of type 2 inflammation 
biomarkers in both lesional skin (CCL17, CCL18 and CCL26) and in blood (CCL17, periostin and 
IgE). In lesional skin, treatment with tralokinumab led also to reductions in epidermal thickness and to 
increase in marker of epithelial barrier integrity (loricrin). Skin colonization with 
Staphylococcus aureus was reduced more than 10-fold in patients treated with tralokinumab. 
Treatment with tralokinumab also resulted in a shift of the stratum corneum lipid profile from a 
lesional to that of non-lesional skin, indicating improvement of the skin barrier integrity. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of tralokinumab as monotherapy and with concomitant topical corticosteroids 
(TCS) were evaluated in three pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
(ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3) in 1 976 patients 18 years of age and older with moderate-
to-severe atopic dermatitis defined by Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or 4 
(moderate or severe), an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score of ≥ 16 at baseline, and a 
minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10%. Eligible patients enrolled into the three 
studies had previous inadequate response to topical medicinal products. 
In all three studies, patients received 1) an initial dose of 600 mg tralokinumab (four 150 mg 
injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg every two weeks (Q2W) up to week 16 or 2) matching 
placebo. In ECZTRA 3, patients received concomitant topical corticosteroids on active lesions as 
needed. Tralokinumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in all studies.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, to evaluate the maintenance of response, patients responding to the 
initial 16-week treatment with tralokinumab (i.e. achieved IGA 0 or 1, or EASI-75) were 
re-randomised to 1) tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W or 2) tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W (alternating 
tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo Q2W) or 3) placebo Q2W up to 52 weeks. The main endpoints for 
evaluating maintenance of response were IGA 0 or 1 and EASI-75 at week 52. Patients responding to 
the initial 16-week treatment with placebo continued on placebo. Subjects not achieving IGA 0 or 1 or 
EASI-75 at week 16 and subjects who did not maintain the response during the maintenance period 
were transferred to open-label treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional use of topical 
corticosteroids. The studies had a treatment period of 52 weeks. 
In ECZTRA 3, patients responding to the initial 16-week treatment with tralokinumab + TCS (i.e. 
achieved IGA 0 or 1, or EASI-75) were re-randomised to 1) tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS or 2) 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W + TCS (alternating tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo Q2W) up to 
32 weeks. The main endpoints for evaluating maintenance of response were IGA 0 or 1 and EASI-75 
at week 32. Patients responding to the initial 16-week treatment with placebo + TCS continued on 
placebo + TCS. Patients who at week 16 did not achieve IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 continued on 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS treatment, irrespectively of their initial treatment. The study had a 
treatment period of 32 weeks. 
In ECZTRA 1, 802 patients were enrolled (199 to placebo, 603 to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W). 
In ECZTRA 2, 794 patients were enrolled (201 to placebo, 593 to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W).  
In ECZTRA 3, 380 patients were enrolled (127 to placebo + TCS, 253 to tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W + TCS).  
Endpoints 
In all three pivotal studies, the primary endpoints were achievement of IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost 
clear”) and a reduction of at least 75% in EASI (EASI-75) from baseline to week 16. Secondary 
endpoints included the reduction of itch as defined by at least a 4-point improvement in the Worst 
Daily Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) from baseline to week 16, reduction in the SCORing 
Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scale from baseline to week 16, and change from baseline to week 16 in 
the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Additional secondary endpoints included reduction of at 
least 50% and 90% in EASI (EASI-50 and EASI-90, respectively) and reduction in Worst Daily 
Pruritus NRS (weekly average) from baseline to week 16. Other endpoints included change from 
baseline to week 16 in the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), at least 4-point improvement in 
POEM, and Eczema-related Sleep NRS. 
Baseline characteristics  
In the monotherapy studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2), across all treatment groups, the mean age 
was 37.8 years, 5.0% of the patients were 65 years of age or older, the mean weight was 76.0 kg, 
40.7% were female, 66.5% were White, 22.9% were Asian, and 7.5% were Black. In these studies, 
49.9% of patients had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate atopic dermatitis, 49.7% of patients had a 
baseline IGA of 4 (severe atopic dermatitis), and 42.5% of patients had received prior systemic 
immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate). The mean 
baseline EASI score was 32.3, mean baseline Worst Daily Pruritus NRS was 7.8, mean baseline DLQI 
was 17.3, the baseline mean SCORAD score was 70.4, the baseline mean POEM score was 22.8, and 
the baseline mean physical and mental components of SF-36 were 43.4 and 44.3, respectively. 
In the concomitant topical corticosteroids study (ECZTRA 3), across both treatment groups, the mean 
age was 39.1 years, 6.3% of the patients were 65 years of age or older, the mean weight was 79.4 kg, 
45.0% were female, 75.8% were white, 10.8% were Asian, and 9.2% were black. In this study, 53.2% 
of patients had a baseline IGA score of 3, 46.3% of patients had a baseline IGA of 4, and 39.2 % of 
patients received prior systemic immunosuppressants. The baseline mean EASI score was 29.4, the 
baseline Worst Daily Pruritus NRS was 7.7, the baseline mean DLQI was 17.5, the baseline mean 
SCORAD score was 67.6, the baseline mean POEM score was 22.3.

Clinical response 
Monotherapy studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) – initial treatment period 0-16 weeks 
In ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, from baseline to week 16, a significantly greater proportion of patients 
randomised to and dosed with tralokinumab achieved IGA 0 or 1, EASI-75, and/or an improvement of 
≥ 4 points on the Worst Daily Pruritus NRS compared to placebo (see Table 2).

In both monotherapy studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2), tralokinumab reduced itch, as measured by 
the percent change from baseline in Worst Daily Pruritus NRS, already at Week 1 compared to 
placebo. The reduction in itch was observed in parallel with improvements in objective signs and 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis and quality of life. 
In the two studies, fewer patients randomised to Adtralza 300 mg Q2W needed rescue treatment 
(topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, non-steroidal immunosuppressants) as compared to 
patients randomised to placebo (29.3% versus 45.3%, respectively, across both studies). Use of rescue 
treatment was higher if patients had severe atopic dermatitis at baseline (39.3% if under tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W treatment versus 56.7% in placebo group). 
Monotherapy Studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) – maintenance period (week 16-52) 
To evaluate maintenance of response, 185 subjects from ECZTRA 1 and 227 subjects from 
ECZTRA 2 treated with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W for 16 weeks who achieved IGA 0 or 1 or 
EASI-75 at week 16 were re-randomised to an additional 36-week treatment of 1) 300 mg

(IGA 0/1 or EASI-75) at week 52 in the monotherapy pool were 56.2% and 50% for tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W among subjects achieving clinical response at week 16, 
respectively.

ECZTRA 2 achieved EASI-75 at week 52. The clinical response was mainly driven by continued 
tralokinumab treatment rather than optional topical corticosteroids treatment.  
32-Week concomitant TCS study (ECZTRA 3) – initial treatment period 0-16 weeks 
In ECZTRA 3 from baseline to week 16, a significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS achieved IGA 0 or 1, EASI-75, and/or an improvement of 
≥ 4 points on the Worst Daily Pruritus NRS compared to placebo + TCS (see Table 4).

In ECZTRA 3, subjects who received tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W from Week 0 to 16 used 50% less of 
the supplied topical corticosteroids at Week 16 as compared to subjects who received placebo. 
In the concomitant TCS study (ECZTRA 3), tralokinumab + TCS reduced itch, as measured by the 
percent change from baseline in Worst Daily Pruritus NRS, already at Week 2 compared to 
placebo + TCS. The reduction in itch was observed in parallel with improvements in objective signs 
and symptoms of atopic dermatitis and quality of life. 
32-Week concomitant TCS study (ECZTRA 3) – maintenance period 16-32 weeks 
To evaluate maintenance of response, subjects treated with tralokinumab 300 mg + TCS for 16 weeks 
in the ECZTRA 3 study and who achieved IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 at week 16 were re-randomised to 
an additional 16-week treatment of 1) tralokinumab 300 mg every two weeks (Q2W) + TCS or 
2) alternating tralokinumab 300 mg + TCS and placebo every two weeks (tralokinumab Q4W) for a 
cumulative 32-week study treatment. High maintenance of clinical efficacy at week 32 were seen 
across tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS and tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W + TCS among subjects 
achieving clinical response at week 16 (see Table 5).

Among all the subjects who achieved either IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 at week 16, the mean percentage 
improvement in EASI score from baseline was 93.5% at week 32 when maintained on tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W + TCS and 91.5% at week 32 for subjects on tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W + TCS. 
Of the subjects randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS who did not achieve IGA 0 or 1 or

continuously with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS for additional 16 weeks.  
The continued improvement among the subjects who did not achieve IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 at 
week 16 occurred in conjunction with the improvement of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS and objective 
signs of atopic dermatitis including SCORAD.

Patient-reported outcomes  
In both monotherapy studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) and in the concomitant TCS study 
(ECZTRA 3) tralokinumab improved patient-reported symptoms of atopic dermatitis, as measured by 
POEM, and the impact of atopic dermatitis on sleep, as measured by Eczema-related sleep NRS, at 
week 16 compared to placebo. A higher proportion of patients treated with tralokinumab had clinically 
meaningful reductions in POEM, (defined as at least 4 point improvement) from baseline to week 16 
compared to placebo. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in adolescents 
The efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in adolescent patients was evaluated in a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ECZTRA 6) in 289 adolescent 
patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis defined by IGA score ≥ 3 in 
the overall assessment of atopic dermatitis lesions on a severity scale of 0 to 4, an EASI score ≥ 16 at 
baseline, and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 10%. Eligible patients enrolled into this study had 
previous inadequate response to topical medication. 
Patients received an initial dose of 600 mg tralokinumab or 300 mg on day 1 followed by 
300 mg Q2W or 150 mg Q2W, respectively, up to week 16. To evaluate the maintenance of response 
up to week 52, patients responding (i.e. achieved IGA 0 or 1, or EASI-75) to the initial 16-week 
treatment with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q2W, without the use of rescue medication, 
were re-randomized to Q2W or Q4W (subjects initially treated with tralokinumab 300 mg were 
re-randomized 1:1 to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W or tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W; subjects initially 
treated with tralokinumab 150 mg were re-randomized 1:1 to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W or 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W). Patients not achieving IGA 0/1 or EASI-75 at week 16 and patients who 
did not maintain the response during the maintenance treatment period and those that used rescue 
medication during the initial period were transferred to open-label treatment with tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W with optional use of topical corticosteroids. Patients randomised to placebo in the initial 
treatment period who achieved a clinical response at week 16 continued to receive placebo Q2W in the 
maintenance treatment period. 
In this study, the mean age was 14.6 years, the mean weight was 61.5 kg, 48.4% were female, 56.7% 
were White, 24.6% were Asian, and 11.1% were Black. At baseline 53.3% of patients had a baseline 
IGA score of 3 (moderate atopic dermatitis), 46.7% of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe atopic 
dermatitis), the mean BSA involvement was 51.1%, and 21.1% of patients had received prior systemic 
immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate). Also, at baseline 
the mean EASI score was 31.7, the baseline Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS score was 7.6, the 
baseline mean SCORAD score was 67.8, the baseline mean POEM score was 20.4, and the baseline 
mean Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was 13.2. Overall, 84.4% of patients had at 
least one co-morbid allergic condition; 68.2% had allergic rhinitis, 50.9% had asthma, and 57.1% had 
food allergies. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 
(“clear” or “almost clear”) and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least 75% 
in EASI from baseline) at week 16. Secondary endpoints included the reduction in itch, as measured 
by the proportion of subjects with ≥ 4 point improvement in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS from 
baseline, the absolute change in SCORAD from baseline to week 16 and the absolute change in 
CDLQI from baseline to week 16. Additional secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects 
with EASI-50 and EASI-90. Other endpoints included proportion of patients with ≥ 6 point 
improvement in CDLQI and POEM at week 16.

A greater proportion of patients achieved EASI-90 at week 16 in the tralokinumab 150 mg group 
(19.4%) and tralokinumab 300 mg group (17.5%) compared with the placebo group (4.3%). 
Greater improvements in patient-reported symptoms and impacts on quality of life (e.g., sleep) were 
observed at week 16 in the tralokinumab 150 mg and tralokinumab 300 mg groups compared with 
placebo, as measured by the proportion of patients with ≥ 6 point improvement in POEM and the 
proportion of patients with ≥ 6 point improvement in CDLQI. 
In line with the monotherapy results in adults, adolescent efficacy data indicate that the clinical benefit 
achieved at Week 16 is sustained through Week 52. 
Of the subjects randomised to tralokinumab who did not achieve IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 at week 16 or 
used rescue mediation during the initial period and were transferred to open label tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W + optional TCS, 33.3% achieved IGA 0 or 1 at week 52, and 57.8% achieved EASI-75 
at week 52. The clinical response was mainly driven by continued tralokinumab treatment rather than 
the optional topical corticosteroids treatment. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
tralokinumab in one or more subset of the paediatric population in atopic dermatitis (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous (SC) dose of tralokinumab median time to maximum concentration in serum (tmax) 
were 5-8 days. The absolute bioavailability of tralokinumab following SC dosing was estimated by 
population PK analysis to be 76%. In a phase 1 trial (10 subjects per arm), bioavailability was 
estimated to be 62% for the 150 mg dose and 60% for the 300 mg dose. 
Steady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following a 600 mg starting dose and 300 mg 
every other week. Across clinical studies (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3), the mean ±SD 
steady-state trough concentration ranged from 98.0±41.1 mcg/mL to 101.4±42.7 mcg/mL for 300 mg 
dose administered every other week. 
Distribution 
A volume of distribution for tralokinumab of approximately 4.2 L was estimated by population PK 
analysis. 
Biotransformation 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because tralokinumab is a protein. Tralokinumab is 
expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
Tralokinumab is eliminated through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway. Half-life is 22 days, 
consistent with the typical estimate for human IgG4 monoclonal antibodies targeting soluble 
cytokines. In ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3, clearance was estimated by population PK 
analysis to be 0.149 L/day. In phase 1 trials with IV dosing, clearance was estimated to be between 
0.179 and 0.211 L/day 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Exposure of tralokinumab increases proportionally to the dose of tralokinumab between 150-600 mg. 
Special populations 
Gender 
Gender was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic 
exposure of tralokinumab determined by population PK analysis. 
Age 
Age was not found to be associated with clinically relevant impact of systemic exposure of 
tralokinumab determined by population PK analysis. 109 subjects above 65 years were included in the 
analysis. 
Race 
Race was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure 
of tralokinumab by population PK analysis.  
Hepatic impairment 
Tralokinumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. 
No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab. Mild hepatic impairment was not found to affect the PK of 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tralokinumab determined by population PK analysis. Very limited data are available in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
Tralokinumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No 
clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab. Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal 
impairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of tralokinumab. 
Very limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. 
High body weight  
Tralokinumab exposure (AUC) was lower in subjects with higher body weight (see section 4.2).

where F = 0.761. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab in paediatric patients below 12 years has not yet been studied. 
For adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the mean ±SD steady-state through 
concentration (at week 16) was 112.8±39.2 mcg/mL for 300 mg dose administered every other week. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints) and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
The mutagenic potential of tralokinumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are 
not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tralokinumab. An evaluation of the available 
evidence related to IL-13 inhibition and animal toxicology data with tralokinumab does not suggest an 
increased carcinogenic potential for tralokinumab. 
Enhanced pre- and postnatal studies with tralokinumab in monkeys did not identify adverse effects in 
maternal animals or their offspring up to 6 months post-partum. 
No effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs, menstrual cycle and sperm analysis 
were observed in sexually mature monkeys treated subcutaneously with tralokinumab up to 
350 mg/animal (females) or 600 mg/animal (males) (AUC exposure up to 15-fold higher than in 
human patients receiving tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Adtralza is and what it is used for 
Adtralza contains the active substance tralokinumab.  
Tralokinumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that blocks the action of a protein called 
IL-13. IL-13 plays a major role in causing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. 
Adtralza is used to treat adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Adtralza may be used with eczema medicines that you 
apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. 
Using Adtralza for atopic dermatitis can improve your eczema and reduce the related itching and skin 
pain. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Adtralza 
Do not use Adtralza: 
- 
if you are allergic to tralokinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Adtralza. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Adtralza. 
Allergic reactions 
Very rarely, medicines can cause allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and severe allergic reactions 
called anaphylaxis. You must look out for signs of these reactions (such as breathing problems, 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
swelling of the face, mouth, and tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (because of low blood 
pressure), hives, itching and skin rash) while you are using Adtralza. 
Stop using Adtralza and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs of an 
allergic reaction. Such signs are listed in the beginning of section 4. 
Parasitic infection in the intestines

• 
• 
• 
Make sure the labels show the correct name of the medicine, Adtralza. 
Check the expiry date on the syringes. 
Check the medicine through the viewing windows. The medicine should be clear to opalescent, 
colourless to pale yellow. 
Do not use the Adtralza pre-filled syringes if:  
• 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o 
o 
o 
the expiry date on the syringes has passed 
the medicine is cloudy, discoloured, or has particles in it 
the pre-filled syringes look damaged or have been dropped 
If you cannot use the syringes, dispose of them in a puncture-resistant container and use new syringes.

about it. 
Step 2: Choosing and preparing injection area 
Injection by caregiver only 
Self-injection or injection by caregiver 
2a: Choose the area for your injections 
• 
You may inject into: 
o 
o

other hand and throw it into the puncture-resistant container. 
• 
Do not try to recap the Adtralza pre-filled syringes. 
• 
Do not hold the plunger rod or plunger head while removing the needle cover. 
• 
You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. 
• 
Do not touch the needle, or let it touch any surface. 
3b: Insert the needle 
With one hand, gently pinch and hold a fold of skin where you cleaned the injection area. With the 
other hand, insert the needle completely into your skin at a 45-90 degree angle. 
3c: Inject the medicine 
Use your thumb to firmly push the plunger head all the way down. All the medicine is injected when 
you cannot push the plunger head any further. 
54

Lift your thumb off the plunger head. The needle will automatically move back inside the syringe 
body and lock into place. 
• 
Place a dry cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection area for a few seconds. Do not rub the 
injection area. If needed, cover the injection area with a small bandage. 
There may be a small amount of blood or liquid where you injected. This is normal. 
• 
Throw away the used Adtralza pre-filled syringe in a puncture-resistant container. See Step 5 
“Disposing of Adtralza”. 
Step 4: Injecting the second syringe 
repeat 
To get your full prescribed dose, you will need to give a second injection. Get a new Adtralza 
pre-filled syringe and repeat Steps 3 and 5.

one. 
Step 5: Disposing of Adtralza 
• 
Put the used Adtralza pre-filled syringes in a puncture-resistant container straight away after 
use. 
o 
Do not throw the Adtralza pre-filled syringes in your household trash. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you do not have a puncture-resistant container, you may use a household container that is: 
o 
o 
made of heavy-duty plastic, 
can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to 
come out, 
upright and stable during use, 
leak-resistant, and 
properly labelled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. 
o 
o 
o 
•  When your puncture-resistant container is almost full, you will need to follow your community 
guidelines for the right way to dispose of your puncture-resistant container.  
Do not recycle your used puncture-resistant container.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Adtralza is and what it is used for 
Adtralza contains the active substance tralokinumab.  
Tralokinumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that blocks the action of a protein called 
IL-13. IL-13 plays a major role in causing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. 
Adtralza is used to treat adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Adtralza may be used with eczema medicines that you 
apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. 
Using Adtralza for atopic dermatitis can improve your eczema and reduce the related itching and skin 
pain. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Adtralza 
Do not use Adtralza: 
- 
if you are allergic to tralokinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Adtralza. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Adtralza. 
Allergic reactions 
Very rarely, medicines can cause allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and severe allergic reactions 
called anaphylaxis. You must look out for signs of these reactions (such as breathing problems,

swelling of the face, mouth, and tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (because of low blood 
pressure), hives, itching and skin rash) while you are using Adtralza. 
Stop using Adtralza and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs of an 
allergic reaction. Such signs are listed in the beginning of section 4. 
Parasitic infection in the intestines 
Adtralza may reduce your resistance to infections caused by parasites. Any parasitic infection should 
be treated before you start treatment with Adtralza. Tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset 
stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration which could be signs of a parasitic infection. If you live in a 
region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region, tell your doctor. 
Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in 
vision. 
Children

Step 3: Injecting Adtralza 
3a: Pull off the Adtralza cap

the puncture-resistant container. The needle guard is now exposed. It is there to prevent you from 
touching the needle.  
• 
Do not try to recap the pre-filled pen. This could cause the injection to happen too soon or 
damage the needle. 
Do not try to touch or push on the needle guard with your finger. This could cause needle stick 
injury. 
• 
3b: Place the Adtralza pre-filled pen at the injection site so that you can see the viewing window 
You can gently pinch the skin where you cleaned the injection area or give the injection without 
pinching the skin. Follow your healthcare professional´s instructions on how to inject.

Place the needle guard of the pre-filled pen flat against your skin (90-degree angle) at the 
injection site you have cleaned. Make sure you can see the viewing window.  
•  Do not change the position of the pre-filled pen after the injection has started. 
If the pre-filled pen is removed too soon, you may see a stream of medicine coming from the pre-
filled pen. If this happens you may not have received your full dose. Call your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.

can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to 
come out, 
upright and stable during use, 
leak-resistant, and

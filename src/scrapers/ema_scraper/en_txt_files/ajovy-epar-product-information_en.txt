CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
AJOVY is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per 
month. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of 
migraine. 
Posology 
Two dosing options are available: 
•  225 mg once monthly (monthly dosing) or 
•  675 mg every three months (quarterly dosing) 
When switching dosing regimens, the first dose of the new regimen should be administered on the 
next scheduled dosing date of the prior regimen.  
When initiating treatment with fremanezumab, concomitant migraine preventive treatment may be 
continued, if considered necessary by the prescriber (see section 5.1). 
The treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further 
decision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to 
continue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter.

Missed dose 
If a fremanezumab injection is missed on the planned date, dosing should resume as soon as possible 
on the indicated dose and regimen. A double dose must not be administered to make up for a missed 
dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is limited data available on the use of fremanezumab in patients ≥65 years of age. Based on the 
results of population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of AJOVY in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not yet 
been established. No data are available.  
Method of administration  
Subcutaneous use. 
AJOVY is for subcutaneous injection only. AJOVY can be injected into areas of the abdomen, thigh, 
or upper arm that are not tender, bruised, red, or indurated. For multiple injections, injection sites 
should be alternated. 
Patients may self-inject if instructed in subcutaneous self-injection technique by a healthcare 
professional. For further instructions on administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely with fremanezumab (see section 4.8). Most reactions 
have occurred within 24 hours of administration although some reactions have been delayed. Patients 
should be warned about the symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions. If a serious 
hypersensitivity reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and do not continue treatment with 
fremanezumab (see section 4.3). 
Major cardiovascular diseases 
Patients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see 
section 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients.

Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., is essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with AJOVY. No pharmacokinetic 
drug interactions are expected based on the characteristics of fremanezumab. Furthermore, 
concomitant use of acute migraine treatments (specifically analgesics, ergots, and triptans) and 
migraine preventive medicinal products during the clinical studies did not affect the pharmacokinetics 
of fremanezumab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of AJOVY in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of AJOVY during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fremanezumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be excreted 
in breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. 
Afterwards, use of fremanezumab could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
AJOVY has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of over 2,500 patients (more than 1,900 patient years) have been treated with AJOVY in 
registration studies. More than 1,400 patients were treated for at least 12 months. 
Commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were local reactions at the injection site 
(pain [24%], induration [17%], erythema [16%] and pruritus [2%]). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
ADRs from clinical studies and post-marketing reports are presented according to MedDRA system 
organ classification. Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness. Frequency categories are based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare 
(<1/10,000). Within each system organ class, ADRs are ranked by frequency, most frequent reactions 
first. 
The following ADRs have been identified for AJOVY (Table 1).

Injection site reactions 
The most frequently observed local reactions at the injection site were pain, induration and erythema. 
All local injection site reactions were transient and predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Pain, 
induration and erythema were typically observed immediately after injection while pruritus and rash 
appeared within a median of 24 and 48 hours, respectively. All injection site reactions resolved, 
mostly within a few hours or days. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation 
of the medicinal product. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported rarely. These reactions mostly occurred within 24 hours of 
administration although some reactions have been delayed. 
Immunogenicity 
In placebo-controlled studies, 0.4 % of patients (6 out of 1,701) treated with fremanezumab developed 
anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The antibody responses were of low titer. One of these 6 patients 
developed neutralising antibodies. With 12 months of treatment, ADA were detected in 2.3% of the 
patients (43 out of 1,888) with 0.95% of the patients developing neutralising antibodies. The safety 
and efficacy of fremanezumab were not affected by ADA development. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 2,000 mg have been administered intravenously in clinical trials without dose-limiting 
toxicity. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or 
symptoms of adverse reactions and given appropriate symptomatic treatment if necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists. ATC 
code: N02CD03.

Mechanism of action 
Fremanezumab is a humanised IgG2Δa/kappa monoclonal antibody derived from a murine precursor. 
Fremanezumab selectively binds the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks both 
CGRP isoforms (α-and β-CGRP) from binding to the CGRP receptor. While the precise mechanism of 
action by which fremanezumab prevents migraine attacks is unknown, it is believed that prevention of 
migraine is obtained by its effect modulating the trigeminal system. CGRP levels have been shown to 
increase significantly during migraine and return to normal with headache relief. 
Fremanezumab is highly specific for CGRP and does not bind to closely related family members (e.g., 
amylin, calcitonin, intermedin and adrenomedullin). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of fremanezumab was assessed in two randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-
controlled phase III studies in adult patients with episodic (Study 1) and chronic migraine (Study 2). 
The patients enrolled had at least a 12-month history of migraine (with and without aura) according to 
the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) diagnostic criteria. Elderly patients 
(>70 years), patients using opioids or barbiturates on more than 4 days per month, and patients with 
pre-existing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and thromboembolic events were 
excluded. 
Episodic migraine study (Study 1) 
The efficacy of fremanezumab was evaluated in episodic migraine in a randomised, multicentre, 
12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (Study 1). Adults with a history of episodic migraine 
(less than 15 headache days per month) were included in the study. A total of 875 patients 
(742 females, 133 males) were randomised into one of three arms: 675 mg fremanezumab every three 
months (quarterly, n=291), 225 mg fremanezumab once a month (monthly, n=290), or monthly 
administration of placebo (n=294) administered via subcutaneous injection. Demographics and 
baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study arms. Patients had a 
median age of 42 years (range: 18 to 70 years), 85% were female, and 80% were white. The mean 
migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 9 migraine days per month. Patients were allowed 
to use acute headache treatments during the study. A sub-set of patients (21%) was also allowed to use 
one commonly used concomitant, preventive medicinal product (beta-blockers, calcium channel 
blocker/benzocycloheptene, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Overall, 19% of the patients had 
previously used topiramate. A total of 791 patients completed the 12-week double-blind treatment 
period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of 
migraine days during the 12-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints were the achievement of 
at least 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days (50% responder rate), mean change 
from baseline in the patient reported MIDAS score, and change from baseline in monthly average 
number of days of acute headache medicinal product use. Both monthly and quarterly dosing regimens 
of fremanezumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement from 
baseline compared to placebo for key endpoints (see Table 2). The effect also occurred from as early 
as the first month and sustained over the treatment period (see Figure 1).

In patients on one other concomitant, migraine preventive medicinal product, the treatment difference 
for the reduction of monthly migraine days (MMD) observed between fremanezumab 675 mg 
quarterly and placebo was -1.8 days (95% CI: -2.95, -0.55) and between fremanezumab 225 mg 
monthly and placebo -2.0 days (95% CI: -3.21, -0.86). 
In patients who had previously used topiramate the treatment difference for the reduction of monthly 
migraine days (MMD) observed between fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly and placebo was -2.3 days 
(95% CI: -3.64, -1.00) and between fremanezumab 225 mg monthly and placebo -2.4 days 
(95% CI: -3.61, -1.13). 
Chronic migraine study (Study 2) 
Fremanezumab was evaluated in chronic migraine in a randomised, multicentre, 12-week, placebo-
controlled, double-blind study (Study 2). The study population included adults with a history of 
chronic migraine (15 headache days or higher per month). A total of 1,130 patients (991 females, 
139 males) were randomised into one of three arms: 675 mg fremanezumab starting dose followed by 
225 mg fremanezumab once a month (monthly, n=379), 675 mg fremanezumab every three months 
(quarterly, n=376), or monthly administration of placebo (n=375) administered via subcutaneous 
injection. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between 
the study arms. Patients had a median age of 41 years (range: 18 to 70 years), 88% were female, and 
79% were white. The mean headache frequency at baseline was approximately 21 headache days per 
month (of which 13 headache days were of at least moderate severity). Patients were allowed to use 
acute headache treatments during the study. A sub-set of patients (21%) was also allowed to use one 
commonly used concomitant, preventive medicinal product (beta-blockers, calcium channel 
blocker/benzocycloheptene, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Overall, 30% of the patients had 
previously used topiramate and 15% onabotulinumtoxin A. A total of 1,034 patients completed the 
12-week double-blind treatment period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of 
headache days of at least moderate severity during the 12-week treatment period. Key secondary 
endpoints were the achievement of at least 50% reduction from baseline in monthly headache days of 
at least moderate severity (50% responder rate), mean change from baseline in the patient reported 
HIT-6 score, and change from baseline in monthly average number of days of acute headache 
medicinal product use. Both monthly and quarterly dosing regimens of fremanezumab demonstrated 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement from baseline compared to placebo for 
key endpoints (see Table 3). The effect also occurred from as early as the first month and sustained 
over the treatment period (see Figure 2).

In patients on one other concomitant, migraine preventive medicinal product, the treatment difference 
for the reduction of monthly headache days (MHD) of at least moderate severity observed between 
fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly and placebo was -1.3 days (95% CI: -2.66, 0.03) and between 
fremanezumab 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose and placebo -2.0 days 
(95% CI: -3.27, -0.67). 
In patients who had previously used topiramate the treatment difference for the reduction of monthly 
headache days (MHD) of at least moderate severity observed between fremanezumab 675 mg 
quarterly and placebo was -2.7 days (95% CI: -3.88, -1.51) and between fremanezumab 225 mg 
monthly with 675 mg starting dose and placebo -2.9 days (95% CI: -4.10, -1.78). In patients who had 
previously used onabotulinumtoxin A the treatment difference for the reduction of monthly headache 
days (MHD) of at least moderate severity observed between fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly and 
placebo was -1.3 days (95% CI: -3.01, -0.37) and between fremanezumab 225 mg monthly with 
675 mg starting dose and placebo -2.0 days (95% CI: -3.84, -0.22). 
Approximately 52% of the patients in the study had acute headache medication overuse. The observed 
treatment difference for the reduction of monthly headache days (MHD) of at least moderate severity 
between fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly and placebo in these patients was -2.2 days (95% CI: -3.14, 
-1.22) and between fremanezumab 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose and placebo -2.7 days 
(95% CI: -3.71, -1.78). 
Long-term study (Study 3) 
For all episodic and chronic migraine patients, efficacy was sustained for up to 12 additional months in 
the long-term study (Study 3), in which patients received 225 mg fremanezumab monthly or 675 mg 
quarterly. 79% of patients completed the 12-month treatment period of Study 3. Pooled across the two 
dosing regimens, a reduction of 6.6 monthly migraine days was observed after 15 months relative to 
Study 1 and Study 2 baseline. 61% of patients completing Study 3 achieved a 50% response in the last 
month of the study. No safety signal was observed during the 15-month combined treatment period. 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
The efficacy and safety of fremanezumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, use of 
concomitant preventive medicinal products (beta-blockers, calcium channel 
blocker/benzocycloheptene, antidepressants, anticonvulsants), use of topiramate or 
onabotulinumtoxin A for migraine in the past, and acute headache medication overuse. 
There is limited data available on the use of fremanezumab in patients ≥65 years of age (2% of the 
patients). 
Difficult to treat migraine  
The efficacy and safety of fremanezumab in a total of 838 episodic and chronic migraine patients with 
documented inadequate response to two to four classes of prior migraine preventive medicinal 
products was assessed in a randomised study (Study 4), which was composed of a 12-week double-
blind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by a 12-week open-label period. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of 
migraine days during the 12-week double-blind treatment period. Key secondary endpoints were the 
achievement of at least 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days, the mean change from 
baseline in the monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity and change 
from baseline in monthly average number of days of acute headache medicinal product use. Both 
monthly and quarterly dosing regimens of fremanezumab demonstrated statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement from baseline compared to placebo for key endpoints. Therefore, 
the results of Study 4 are consistent with the main findings of the previous efficacy studies and in 
addition demonstrate efficacy in difficult to treat migraine, including mean reduction in monthly 
migraine days (MMD) of -3.7 (95% CI: -4.38, -3.05) with fremanezumab quarterly and -4.1 (95% CI: 
-4.73, -3.41) with fremanezumab monthly compared to -0.6 (95% CI: -1.25, 0.07) in placebo-treated 
patients. 34% of the patients treated with fremanezumab quarterly and 34% of the patients treated with 
fremanezumab monthly achieved at least 50% reduction in MMD, compared to 9% in placebo-treated 
patients (p<0.0001) during the 12-week treatment period. The effect also occurred from as early as the 
first month and was sustained over the treatment period (see Figure 3). No safety signal was observed 
during the 6-month treatment period.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
AJOVY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of migraine headaches (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After single subcutaneous administrations of 225 mg and 675 mg fremanezumab, median time to 
maximum concentrations (tmax) in healthy subjects was 5 to 7 days. The absolute bioavailability of 
fremanezumab after subcutaneous administration of 225 mg and 900 mg in healthy subjects was 55% 
(±SD of 23%) to 66% (±SD of 26%). Dose proportionality, based on population pharmacokinetics, 
was observed between 225 mg to 675 mg. Steady state was achieved by approximately 168 days 
(about 6 months) following 225 mg monthly and 675 mg quarterly dosing regimens. Median 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accumulation ratio, based on once monthly and once quarterly dosing regimens, is approximately 2.4 
and 1.2, respectively. 
Distribution 
Assuming the model-derived estimated bioavailability of 66% (±SD of 26%) holds for the patient 
population, the volume of distribution for a typical patient was 3.6 L (35.1% CV) following 
subcutaneous administration of 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg of fremanezumab. 
Biotransformation 
Similar to other monoclonal antibodies, fremanezumab is expected to be degraded by enzymatic 
proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. 
Elimination 
Assuming the model-derived estimated bioavailability of 66% (±SD of 26%) holds for the patient 
population, central clearance for a typical patient was 0.09 L/day (23.4% CV) following subcutaneous 
administration of 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg of fremanezumab. The formed small peptides and 
amino acids may be re-used in the body for de novo synthesis of proteins or are excreted by the 
kidney. Fremanezumab has an estimated half-life of 30 days. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis looking at age, race, gender, and weight was conducted on data 
from 2,546 subjects. Approximately twice as much exposure is expected in the lowest body weight 
quartile (43.5 to 60.5 kg) compared to the highest body weight quartile (84.4 to131.8 kg). However, 
body weight did not have an observed effect on the clinical efficacy based on the exposure-response 
analyses in episodic and chronic migraine patients. No dose adjustments are required for 
fremanezumab. No data on exposure-efficacy relationship in subjects with body weight >132 kg is 
available. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Since monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways or metabolised in the 
liver, renal and hepatic impairment are not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab. 
Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) have not been studied. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of integrated data from the AJOVY clinical studies did not reveal a 
difference in the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment or hepatic impairment relative to those with normal renal or hepatic function (see 
section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
As fremanezumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been 
conducted.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What AJOVY is and what it is used for 
What AJOVY is 
AJOVY is a medicine containing the active substance fremanezumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type 
of protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target in the body.  
How AJOVY works 
A substance in the body called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in 
migraine. Fremanezumab attaches to CGRP and prevents it from working. This reduction in CGRP's 
activity reduces migraine attacks. 
What AJOVY is used for 
AJOVY is used to prevent migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. 
What are the benefits of using AJOVY 
AJOVY reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and days with headache. This medicine also 
decreases the disability associated with migraine and it reduces the need for medicines used to treat 
migraine attacks. 
2.  What you need to know before you use AJOVY  
Do not use AJOVY 
Do not use this medicine if you are allergic to fremanezumab or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get any signs of a serious allergic 
reaction, e.g. trouble breathing, swelling of the lips and tongue, or severe rash, after injecting AJOVY. 
These reactions can occur within 24 hours after using AJOVY but can sometimes be delayed. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had cardiovascular disease (problems affecting the heart and 
blood vessels) before using this medicine, because AJOVY has not been studied in patients with 
certain cardiovascular diseases. 
Children and adolescents 
AJOVY is not recommended for children and adolescents below the age of 18 years because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and AJOVY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of AJOVY during 
pregnancy as the effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known. 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
this medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will use AJOVY while breast-feeding.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. 
AJOVY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use AJOVY 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
Read the “Instructions for Use” for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using AJOVY. 
How much and when to inject 
Your doctor will discuss and decide with you the most appropriate dosing schedule. There are two 
alternative recommended dosing options: 
- 
- 
one injection (225 mg) once a month (monthly dosing) or 
three injections (675 mg) every 3 months (quarterly dosing) 
If your dose is 675 mg, inject the three injections one after another, each in a different place. 
AJOVY is given by injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your doctor or nurse will 
explain to you or your caregiver how to give the injection. Do not inject AJOVY until you or your 
caregiver have been trained by your doctor or nurse. 
Use a reminder method such as notes in a calendar or diary to help you remember your next dose so 
that you do not miss a dose or have a dose too soon after the last one. 
If you use more AJOVY than you should 
If you have used more AJOVY than you should, tell your doctor. 
If you forget or miss to use AJOVY 
If you have missed a dose of AJOVY, inject your missed dose as soon as you can. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are not sure when to inject AJOVY, talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

1.  What AJOVY is and what it is used for 
What AJOVY is 
AJOVY is a medicine containing the active substance fremanezumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type 
of protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target in the body.  
How AJOVY works 
A substance in the body called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in 
migraine. Fremanezumab attaches to CGRP and prevents it from working. This reduction in CGRP's 
activity reduces migraine attacks. 
What AJOVY is used for 
AJOVY is used to prevent migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. 
What are the benefits of using AJOVY 
AJOVY reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and days with headache. This medicine also 
decreases the disability associated with migraine and it reduces the need for medicines used to treat 
migraine attacks. 
2.  What you need to know before you use AJOVY  
Do not use AJOVY 
Do not use this medicine if you are allergic to fremanezumab or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get any signs of a serious allergic 
reaction, e.g. trouble breathing, swelling of the lips and tongue, or severe rash, after injecting AJOVY. 
These reactions can occur within 24 hours after using AJOVY but can sometimes be delayed.

blood vessels) before using this medicine, because AJOVY has not been studied in patients with 
certain cardiovascular diseases. 
Children and adolescents 
AJOVY is not recommended for children and adolescents below the age of 18 years because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and AJOVY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of AJOVY during 
pregnancy as the effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known. 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
this medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will use AJOVY while breast-feeding.  
Driving and using machines

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use AJOVY 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
Read the “Instructions for Use” for the pre-filled pen carefully before using AJOVY. 
How much and when to inject 
Your doctor will discuss and decide with you the most appropriate dosing schedule. There are two 
alternative recommended dosing options: 
- 
- 
one injection (225 mg) once a month (monthly dosing) or 
three injections (675 mg) every 3 months (quarterly dosing) 
If your dose is 675 mg, inject the three injections one after another, each in a different place. 
AJOVY is given by injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your doctor or nurse will 
explain to you or your caregiver how to give the injection. Do not inject AJOVY until you or your 
caregiver have been trained by your doctor or nurse. 
Use a reminder method such as notes in a calendar or diary to help you remember your next dose so 
that you do not miss a dose or have a dose too soon after the last one. 
If you use more AJOVY than you should 
If you have used more AJOVY than you should, tell your doctor. 
If you forget or miss to use AJOVY 
If you have missed a dose of AJOVY, inject your missed dose as soon as you can. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are not sure when to inject AJOVY, talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

in the carton. 
AJOVY pre-filled pen (before use)  
AJOVY pre-filled pen (after use)  
•  The blue plunger moves down the viewing window during the injection. The blue plunger fills 
the window when the injection is complete. (Note: When the blue plunger has filled the 
viewing window you will still be able to see the grey stopper.)  
•  When injecting AJOVY, hold the pre-filled pen so that your hand does not cover the viewing 
window. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
 
Step 1: Getting ready for an injection  
a)  Gather the following supplies for your injection: 
−  1 or 3 AJOVY pre-filled pens to enable 1 or 3 injections depending on your dose 
−  1 alcohol swab per injection 
−  1 gauze pad or cotton ball per injection 
−  1 sharps disposal or puncture-resistant container 
b)  Place the supplies you have gathered on a clean, flat surface. 
c)  Wait for 30 minutes to let AJOVY reach room temperature (<30 °C) to reduce 
discomfort during injection.  
−  Do not leave the pre-filled pen in direct sunlight. 
−  Do not warm up the pre-filled pen using a microwave or any other heat source. 
d)  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry well with a clean towel. 
e)  Inspect your AJOVY pre-filled pen. 
−  Check the pen label. Make sure the name AJOVY appears on the label. 
−  Check that the medicine in the pen viewing window looks clear and is colourless to 
slightly yellow. 
−  You may see small air bubbles in the pre-filled pen. This is normal. 
−  Do not use the pre-filled pen if you see any of the following: 
  The pen looks damaged. 
  The expiration date has passed or the pre-filled pen has been out of the 
refrigerator for longer than 7 days. 
  The medicine is cloudy, discoloured, or contains particles. 
f)  Choose your injection area. 
−  Choose an injection area from the following areas: 
  Your stomach area (abdomen), avoid about 5 cm around the belly button 
  The front of your thighs, about 5 cm above the knee and 5 cm below the 
groin 
  The back of your upper arms, in the fleshy areas of the upper back portion 
− 
If multiple injections are required, they may be given in the same or different area 
(abdomen, thigh, upper arm), but you should avoid injecting in exactly the same place. 
41 
 
 
 
 
g)  Clean your injection area. 
−  Clean the chosen injection area using a new alcohol swab. 
−  Wait 10 seconds to allow the skin to dry before injecting. 
−  Do not inject AJOVY into an area that is tender, red, hot, bruised, hardened, tattooed 
or that has scars or stretch marks. 
Step 2: How to inject  
a)  Remove the protective cap and do not replace.  
−  Pull the protective cap straight off. Do not twist. 
−  Do not put the protective cap back on the pre-filled pen, to avoid injury and infection. 
−  Do not touch the needle shield area. 
b)  Inject by following the steps below. 
−  Place the pre-filled pen at a 90° angle against your skin at the injection site. 
−  Press down on the pre-filled pen and keep pressed down against the skin for about 30 
seconds. Do not remove pressure until the 3 steps below are complete. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  You hear the first 
“click” (this signals 
the start of the 
injection and the blue 
plunger starts to 
move). 
2.  You hear a second “click” 
(about 15 seconds after the 
first “click”; the plunger 
will be moving to the 
bottom of the viewing 
window as the medicine is 
being injected). 
3.  You wait another 10 seconds 
(to make sure all of the 
medicine is injected). 
c)  Check that the blue plunger has filled the viewing window and remove the pre-filled pen 
from your skin.

window and you are able to see the grey stopper, remove the pre-filled pen from the 
skin by lifting the pre-filled pen straight up and dispose straightaway into a sharp 
disposal container (see step 3). 
−  As the pre-filled pen is lifted from the skin, the needle shield returns to the original 
position and locks into place, covering the needle. 
−  Do not put the protective cap back on the pre-filled pen at any time to avoid injury 
and infection. 
d)  Apply pressure at the injection site. 
−  Use a clean, dry cotton ball, or gauze to gently press on the injection site for a few 
seconds. 
−  Do not rub the injection site or re-use the pre-filled pen. 
Step 3: Disposal of the pre-filled pen  
a)  Dispose of your pre-filled pen right away. 
−  Put your used pre-filled pens in a sharps disposal container right away after use.  
−  Do not throw away (dispose of) pre-filled pens with your household waste.

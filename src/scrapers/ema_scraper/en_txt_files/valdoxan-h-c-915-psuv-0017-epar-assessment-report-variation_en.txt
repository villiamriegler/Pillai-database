1. PSUR Data  
1.1.  Introduction 
Agomelatine is a new antidepressant with a distinct neurochemical profile. It is a melatonin 
receptor agonist (MT1 and MT2) and a subtype 5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. The 
indication is major depressive episodes in adults. 
The data presented is  the 6th PSUR for Valdoxan covering the period 20022012 – 19022013. 
As part of the procedure, the MAH proposed to update the product information as follows: 
- 
Include “restless leg syndrome” as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC and update the 
package leaflet accordingly. 
1.2.  Worldwide marketing authorisation status 
Agomelatine was first authorised in Ukraine on 28.08.2006 and in the EU on 19.02.2009 
(IBD/EURD). 
Agomelatine is approved in more than 80 countries.  
1.3.  Overview of exposure and safety data  
1.3.1.  Actions taken in the reporting interval for safety reasons 
During the assessment of PSUR 5 (period 20.02.2011-19.02.2012) 6 cases of hepatic failure were 
discovered (updated to 8 cases in the variation procedure that followed). For some of these, non-
compliance with recommendations in the SmPC was noticed, and some seemed to occur in 
connection with dose increase (from 25 to 50 mg). This led to updates to the SmPC recommending 
that monitoring of liver enzymes should be performed when the dosage is increased and with the 
same intervals as recommended when treatment is started (i.e. after 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks). 
Additionally, an increase in the incidence of transaminase elevations > 3 ULN was noted (from 
1,2% and 1,7% to 1,4% and 2,5% on 25 and 50 mg, respectively). A DHPC was submitted in 
October 2012 with information that severe hepatotoxic reactions, including hepatic failure, had 
been reported. Prescribers were informed about the updates to the SmPC and reminded to strictly 
adhere to the treatment recommendations for monitoring of the liver function. In December 2012 
updated educational material was submitted, including a monitoring scheme to be used as a tool 
for the physician to document that the recommended liver monitoring has been performed in each 
individual patient. 
To document the effectiveness of the DHPC and educational material, the MAH is currently 
performing a prescription survey in France, Germany, Greece and Spain (results to be submitted to 
EMA in December 2013). 
In October 2012, angioedema was detected as a signal in the Eudravigilance database. CHMP 
adopted the PRAC recommendation to include urticaria, face oedema and angioedema as ADRs in 
section 4.8 of the SPC. 
In February 2013, a signal of QT-prolongation was generated in the Eudravigilance database. QT-
prolongation has also been generated as a signal in the WHO-database  (SIGNAL May 2013, 
Analyses of Reports in the global ICSR Database-Vigibase).

1.3.2.  Changes to reference safety information 
The RSI in effect at the end of the reporting period, corresponds to section 4.3 to 4.9 of the SmPC 
proposed in the context of finalization of the variation related to elderly patients. It is dated 
15.02.2013. 
Updates to the RSI in the current PSUR period: 
Section 4.4. 
- 
information that cases of severe hepatic ADRs, including hepatic failure and elevations of 
liver transaminases > 10 ULN, have been reported. 
-  Recommendations that monitoring of liver enzymes should be performed when the dose is 
increased (from 25 to 50 mg) and with the same intervals as recommended when 
treatment is initiated (i.e. after 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks). 
-  Statement to stop treatment immediately if signs or symptoms of potential liver injury 
occur. Signs and symptoms were described. 
- 
information that no effect is documented in patients ≥ 75 years and that agomelatine is not 
recommended in this age group 
Section 4.5 
Information that the following agents can interact with agomelatine: 
- 
- 
- 
ofloxacin (inhibitor of CYP1A2) 
rifampicin (inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) 
smoking (inducer of CYP1A2) 
Section 4.8: 
The following ADRs were added: 
- 
hepatic failure, jaundice, vomiting, weight increased, weight decreased, urticaria, 
angioedema and face oedema 
The frequency of elevated liver transaminases was updated 
Based on information in the current PSUR (6), the MAH proposes to include “restless leg syndrome” 
as an ADR in section 4.8. (See below discussions and Annex 1) 
No further risk minimisation measures are proposed. 
1.3.3.  Estimated exposure and use patterns 
Cumulative subject exposure in clinical trials 
A total of 14 156 patients were involved in the 47 completed phase II or III clinical trials conducted 
during the agomelatine development plan and 3701 patients were involved in phase IV studies. In 
addition, at the data-lock point of the report, 659 additional patients were involved in the ongoing 
studies. 
The following table displays the number of patients and exposure based on follow-up duration, 
expressed in patient-months, in phase II, III and IV studies:

1.3.5.  Summaries of significant findings from clinical trials in the 
reporting interval 
Completed clinical trials 
During the period covered by this report, five new clinical studies were analyzed: CL2.067, 
CL3.069, CL3.070 and CL3.071 and CL3.073. 
Efficacy findings 
Since MA the MAH has performed six short term studies with different active comparators. These 
are summarised in the section 4. Benefit evaluation. A renewal of the MA for Valdoxan is currently 
ongoing. In this connection the CHMP-Rapporteur has summarized results from 13 studies 
performed after grant of marketing authorisation (including the six studies already mentioned). 
CHMP opinion/RSI of this renewal is foreseen in July 2013. 
Two post commitment studies investigating Agomelatine in the treatment of Major Depressive 
Episodes either in adult (CL3.069) or in elderly (CL3.070) populations, have been performed in 
the actual PSUR interval. 
CL3.069 study (REC 3) aimed at demonstrating the clinical efficacy and safety of at least one of 
the three dose regimens of agomelatine (10, 25, 25-50 mg/day) versus placebo given once a day 
for six weeks in out-patients suffering from moderate to severe MDD. A total of 549 patients were 
enrolled. A total of 505 (92%) patients completed the mandatory W0-W6 period, and 411 (75%) 
entered the double-blind, optional extension period of 18 weeks. 
According  to  the  current  SmPC,  the  dose  may  be  increased  to  50  mg/day  if  no  improvement  is 
seen  after  two  weeks  on  25  mg/day.  One  of  the  main  objectives  of  this  study  was  therefore  to 
demonstrate that the 50 mg dose was more efficacious compared to the 25 mg/dose, as this has 
previously not been shown.  
CHMP concluded that the study does not have a design to allow for a conclusion regarding the 
efficacy of increasing the dose to 50 mg in patients not responding to 25 mg. For the 2 groups 
(25 mg fixed and 25-50 mg) the results are considered clinically relevant compared to placebo, 
however, the difference between the two groups is marginal. It was concluded that the data 
indicated that some patients may still benefit from an increased dose compared to those continuing 
on the 25 mg dose. However, the risk of liver related ADRs is increased on the higher dose. The 
MAH has therefore proposed the following for inclusion in section 4.2 of the SmPC:” Decision of 
dose increase has to be balanced with a higher risk of transaminases elevation. Any dose increase 
to 50 mg should be made on an individual patient benefit/risk basis and with strict respect of LFT 
monitoring.” to reflect the increased risk with the higher dose. This amendment was endorsed by 
CHMP. Accordingly, the MAH has been requested to apply for a type II variation to include this 
information in the SPC. 
Study CL3.070 (FUM 002), assessed by the CHMP, aimed at studying the efficacy and safety of 
agomelatine (25-50 mg/day) for 8 weeks in elderly patients suffering from MDD. A total of 218 
patients were randomized to either agomelatine 25-50 mg/day or placebo. An optional double-blind 
extension period up to 16 weeks was scheduled for this study. Out of the 222 randomized patients, 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 7/73 
 
 
 
 
175 (79 %) completed the mandatory W0-W8 period and 146 (66 %) entered the double-blind 
extension period. The clinical study in patients 65 years and older, revealed a statistically 
significant difference on the primary endpoint, HAM-D 17, between the agomelatine group and the 
placebo group in the full analysis set. The clinical relevance seemed modest; however, it was in line 
with the effect observed for agomelatine in other clinical studies in younger adults. On the 
contrary, no effect was documented for the sub-group of patients ≥75 years. In addition, the 
exposure of agomelatine was shown to increase several fold in this age group compared to patients 
<75 years. The MAH was requested to submit a Type II variation, and the SmPC was amended in 
order to reflect the results achieved in elderly patients.  
Study CL3-20098-073: 
This study aimed at comparing 3 different ways to initiate agomelatine after antidepressant 
treatment by SSRI or SNRI, using the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms check-list: 
either by immediate substitution or by initiation of agomelatine with 2 different taperings of the 
previous drug, in depressed out-patients requiring a change in their antidepressant treatment due 
to an insufficient treatment efficacy (associated or not with poor acceptability). 
Group 1: agomelatine 25 mg o.d. and previous antidepressant at therapeutic dose o.d (20 mg for 
paroxetine, 75 mg for venlafaxine) on the 1st week then at half therapeutic dose on the 2nd week, 
then placebo on the 3rd week (Long tapering). 
Group ½: agomelatine 25 mg o.d. and previous antidepressant at half therapeutic dose o.d. (10 
mg for paroxetine, 35.5mg for venlafaxine) on the 1st week, then placebo on the 2nd and 3rd 
week (Short tapering) 
Group 0: agomelatine 25 mg o.d. on the 3 first weeks (Immediate substitution). 
MAH’s evaluation of the results: 
This international, controlled, phase III study conducted in outpatients suffering from major 
depressive disorder and with insufficient antidepressant treatment efficacy showed that whatever 
the switch strategy (long tapering, short tapering or immediate substitution), discontinuation 
symptoms occurred after the previous antidepressant treatment stop: however, discontinuation 
symptoms were less frequent with long tapering than with short tapering and immediate 
substitution. This was mainly due to the lower number of patients affected (complementary 
analysis). Psychic symptoms were the most frequently reported (nervousness/anxiety, agitation, 
increased dreaming/nightmares, bouts of crying, sudden worsening of mood, trouble 
sleeping/insomnia). Whatever the switch strategy, patients were markedly improved over time 
after intake of agomelatine 25 mg, with a high rate of responders despite failure of the previous 
antidepressant treatment by SSRI or SNRI. Efficacy was similar in all groups after 8 weeks of 
treatment even if for few criteria (feeling good and some emotions) improvement was found 
slightly better in patients with immediate substitution than in patients with tapering of the previous 
AD. For most of efficacy criteria, improvement was clearly less marked when discontinuations 
symptoms were more frequent. This study thus suggested a direct impact of discontinuations 
symptoms on efficacy as judged by the physician (CGI), sleep, daytime sleepiness and in a less 
extent on emotions. 
Emergent adverse events were less frequent in patients with long tapering than in patients with 
short tapering and immediate substitution. This likely reflected the differences in withdrawal 
symptoms evidenced with the DESS. Globally, the greater the length of time of the tapering, the 
lower the number of emergent adverse events there was. Regarding biology and other safety 
criteria, no relevant difference was observed according to the switch strategy.

PRAC position: 
The MAH was advised to consider whether treatment recommendations when therapy is switched 
from another antidepressant therapy (SSRI or SNRI), can be derived from this study. If so, 
treatment recommendations should be included in the SmPC as this is clinical important 
information for the prescriber. 
Study CL2-20098-067: 
This phase II exploratory, multicentre, randomised study conducted in moderate to severe MDD 
patients and healthy volunteers, investigated the effects of treatment (agomelatine or placebo) on 
cerebral activation during an emotional stimulus processing paradigm. This was a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open extension period of 6 months with agomelatine 
(25 mg).Functional MRI Profiles were compared with MRI profiles of healthy volunteers.  
MAH’s evaluation of the results: 
The MAH concludes that agomelatine has an early effect (after 1 week of treatment) on the 
automatic control of self-referential and emotional processes (translated by decreased activations 
of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the amygdala). This early effect was observed before clinical 
improvement of symptoms as there was no relevant difference between agomelatine and placebo 
groups in terms of symptomatic disease. Agomelatine has a later effect (after 7 weeks of 
treatment) leading to a more balanced allocation between cognitive control and automatic 
processes of self-referential relevance (translated by decreased activation of dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex and an increased activation of ventral anterior cingulate). 
Overall the fMRI results suggest that brain changes induced by agomelatine target specific regions 
involved in self-processing and cognitive regulation of emotion.  Agomelatine showed different 
brain effects at W1 and at W7, suggesting a specific time course of brain changes in order to 
correct depressive symptoms. 
No unexpected adverse events were reported. 
Safety findings 
An updated Integrated Analysis of Safety (IAS) was performed on a pool of 46 studies coded with 
MedDRA 15.0 version (cut-off date: 16 November 2012) in order to monitor the risks mentioned in 
the RMP and to detect potential new signals. 
Regarding the known identified hepatic risk monitored in the framework of the RMP and based on 
the overall agomelatine clinical trial database, a higher incidence (1.75%) of transaminases 
elevation (> 3ULN) has been observed after administration of agomelatine 25-50 mg (1.34% on 
agomelatine 25 mg, 2.51% on agomelatine 50 mg) as compared to placebo (0.50%). 
PRAC comments: 
The updated incidences of elevated liver transaminases > 3 ULN are in accordance with incidences 
calculated previously from pooled clinical trials (2.5% for the 50 mg dose compared with 1.4% for 
the 25 mg dose). 
This updated IAS confirmed the known safety profile of agomelatine.  
Valdoxan/Thymanax

No unexpected safety findings were observed in clinical studies completed during the reported 
period. 
Ongoing clinical trials 
During the period of this PSUR, 7 clinical efficacy and safety interventional studies with 
agomelatine were in progress, one in healthy volunteers CL1.081 and six in patients (CL2.072, 
CL3.060, CL3.074, CL3.078, CL3.080 and CL3.083). Around 300 subjects were exposed to 
agomelatine during the reported period. 
Blind Safety Analysis (BSA) was performed in December 2012, on four pooled ongoing studies 
(CL2.072, CL3.060, CL3.080 and CL3.083) in order to monitor the risks mentioned in the RMP and 
to detect potential new signals. The safety analysis performed in blind condition showed no new or 
unexpected findings. 
Regarding the identified risk monitored in the framework of the RMP, three patients experienced a 
transaminases increase > 3 ULN. Among these 3 cases, 2 patients (from CL3.083 study) had a 
transaminases increase between 3-5 ULN, and 1 (from CL3.060 study) had transaminase increase 
> 10 ULN. Two cases were evaluated by the MAH’s Liver Safety Committee, as possibly related and 
one as unlikely related to the treatment. 
Five cases of transaminase increase > 3ULN from CL3.069 study have been unblinded during the 
period of this PSUR (2 cases under agomelatine 50 mg, 2 under 25 mg and 1 case under 10 mg). 
Those cases are taken into account in the last updated Integrated Analysis of Safety (for 
cumulative re-estimated incidence of transaminase increase > 3ULN presented in the relevant 
section below). One case of transaminase increase > 3 ULN from CL3.074 study, unblinded during 
the reported period, occurred under sertraline treatment. 
PRAC comments: 
The reports of increased transaminases from these studies are similar to the reports of 
hepatotoxicity that has been seen previously with agomelatine. Consequently, no new information 
with regards to hepatotoxicity was identified from these reports.  
1.3.6.  Findings from non-interventional studies 
One prospective observational study (CLE-20098-068) conducted according to the European Risk 
Management Plan (EuRMP), was ongoing with 6 365 patients included at the data-lock point of the 
report. The objective is to evaluate the safety of agomelatine in current medical practice in 
depressed patients, with focus on hepatobiliary disorders, suicidality, skin events, patients with 
known renal impairment and elderly patients. This study allows an active surveillance of 
agomelatine on an international scale in usual medical practice. 
Transaminases increase:  
Twenty seven (27) cases of transaminases increase >3ULN were reported, 4 were considered as 
serious and related to agomelatine. 
Out of the 27 patients, 16 had one value ranging between (3-5 ULN), nine (9) patients had one 
value ranging (5-10 ULN) and two (2) patients had one value > 10 ULN. 
Transaminases increase occurred in 17 female patients and 10 male patients. The median time to 
detection was 45 days (range 8-168 days). Eight patients already had abnormal transaminases 
values at baseline. Neither specific signs nor symptoms were reported except for one patient with 
jaundice related to hepatitis C. 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 10/73 
 
 
 
Most of the patients had confounding factors for transaminases increase, mainly 
overweight/obesity (13 cases), and/or concomitant drugs with known potential hepatotoxicity (14 
cases). Six patients had medical history of alcohol abuse or past of alcohol abuse; three other 
patients had pre-existing liver disease (1 fatty liver, 2 liver steatosis). One other patient with a 
known alcohol abuse and chronic hepatitis C had a liver fibrosis and a hepatomegaly reported in 
the medical history. Two patients presented diabetes at baseline. 
Agomelatine was withdrawn in 24 patients (23 recovered or recovering), and maintained in 3 cases 
(all recovered).  
PRAC comments: 
Overall, the 27 cases of transaminases increased from this non-interventional study seemed to 
follow the pattern of such reactions that is known to occur with agomelatine. In many of the cases 
the patients had risk factors for hepatic injury, such as overweight, diabetes and alcohol abuse, 
which is already included in a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In some of the cases, it was 
noted that the patients had an increase in transaminases exceeding 3 X upper limit of normal at 
baseline, thus treatment should not have been initiated had the recommendations in the SmPC 
been strictly adhered to. Overall, it is considered that no new information has been identified from 
these reports.  
Suicide events:  
Thirty three (33) suicide events  were reported in 29 patients during the period of the PSUR, 
whatever the seriousness and relationship. Among these 33 events, there were: 1 completed 
suicide, 9 suicidal attempts, 5 intentional overdoses, 2 intentional self injuries, 1 suicidal 
behaviour, and 15 cases of suicidal ideation. 
Three (3) suicidal events were considered as serious and related to the treatment: 1 case of suicide 
attempts with an intentional overdose and 2 cases of suicidal ideation/behaviour. 
Skin reaction:  
One case of Rash and one case of Cold sweat were assessed as serious and related to agomelatine. 
Pregnancy: Three cases of pregnancies were reported (including one pregnancy with spontaneous 
abortion considered by the physician as serious and related). 
Other Serious Adverse Drug Reactions: 22 patients experienced a serious adverse drug reaction 
(63 events) during the covered period, not including cases of transaminase increase, suicide events 
or skin reactions. The most frequently reported events were: fatigue and asthenia (6 patients), 
dizziness and vertigo (6 patients), nausea (5 patients), headache and migraine (5 patients) and 
depression or depressed mood (4 patients). 
The MAH concludes that no new relevant safety information was identified from the ongoing cohort 
study. 
1.3.7.  Lack of efficacy in controlled clinical trials 
In study CL3.070 efficacy was proven in patients < 75 years, but not in patients ≥ 75 years (FUM 
002). Further information about this study is given in section 2.3.5. 
1.3.8.  Late-breaking information 
No new important information.

1.4.  Discussion and conclusions on PSUR data 
Agomelatine is approved in more than  80 countries.  
During the PSUR-period, a signal of angioedema was generated in the EV database. Following 
recommendation from PRAC, angioedema, urticaria and face oedema were included as ADRs in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Further, a signal of QT-prolongation was generated in EV, as well as in the WHO-database. 
This signal was under evaluation at the time of this report.

Signal evaluation 
A signal detection process is performed at least every 3 months according to internal procedure. All 
worldwide sources are considered. 
Different factors are taken into account in this process such as chronological and 
semiologicalanalysis of events, association to other listed events, confounding factors, 
pharmacological, plausibility and disproportionality analysis in the MAH database. 
The methods of signal’s evaluation include: 
- Review of cases and estimated incidence, 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 12/73 
 
 
 
 
 
- Non clinical and clinical study results, 
- Literature searches, 
- Epidemiological data and post-authorization studies results, 
- Disproportionality analysis in MAH database if relevant, 
- Any other information provided in the context of regulatory procedures or ongoing benefit-risk 
monitoring if applicable, 
- Other ICSR with similar events terms 
An Integrated Analysis of Safety(IAS) of the clinical data was performed through 2 data sets: 
The Overall Safety Set (OSS) includes all completed phase II and phase III S20098 studies in 
adults. This set includes all Servier studies and, since 2011 clinical studies performed by a Servier 
licensee whatever patient’s treatment duration. 
The Overall Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Set (OSS PC DB) includes completed placebo-
controlled studies (26 studies), with a focus on the marketed 25-50mg doses. It corresponds to a 
set of patient with the same treatment duration. It represents a total of 7 096 patients. This 
analysis was performed to overcome the bias due to the difference of treatment duration in the 
OSS. 
During the period covered by this report, two IAS were specifically reviewed: 
- IAS 2011 groups together 44 studies with a total of 13 228 patients, 
- IAS 2012 groups together 46 studies with a total of 13 819 patients. 
Events under close monitoring 
The following events have been under close monitoring in the actual PSUR period: 
Confusion, tinnitus, pancreatitis, hyponatraemia/SIADH, convulsion, blood bilirubin increased, 
muscular events and blood pressure increased, urticaria, alopecia, palpitations, oedema peripheral, 
panic attacks, muscle spasm and tremor. 
Confusion, tinnitus, pancreatitis, hyponatraemia/SIADH, convulsion, blood bilirubin increased, 
muscular events and blood pressure increased. 
Following PSUR 5 the MAH was requested to perform a cumulative review of these cases and 
assess the causality with agomelatine. If relevant, the MAH should consider the need for 
implementing risk minimisation measures.  
This was addressed  in SIAMED PAC No. PSU 011.1.  
It was concluded that the information was too scarce to evaluate the causality between the events 
and  agomelatine. Consequently, the MAH was requested to present an updated cumulative 
overview of these events based on relevant SMQ. In particular, the following information was 
requested: 
a)  Cases with positive rechallenge, including narratives 
b)  Cases with positive dechallenge, including narratives 
c)  Cases recovering during continuous treatment 
d)  Cases where symptoms increased in severity when agomelatine treatment was added to 
other concomitant treatment likely to induce the event

Further on, the MAH was asked to discuss with reference to the SmPC-guidelines, if there is 
evidence to include any of the events in the SmPC.  
Alopecia, palpitations, oedema peripheral, panic attacks, muscle spasm and tremor 
Following PSUR 5 the MAH was requested to discuss these events in the next PSUR. 
Confusion

Page 14/73 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
When the signal was closed on 19.08.2012, 44 events had been reported to the MAH. Later 
additional 12 cases have been reported. 
Review of the narratives indicates that these cases to a great extent could be possibly attributed to 
agomelatine. However, we agree that many confounding factors are present.  
Data from pooled clinical trials (Integrated analysis of safety) show no significant difference in 
incidence of confusion between agomelatine and placebo. The cumulative incidence since grant of 
MA has decreased since the previous PSUR (no 5) period (from 7.8/100 000 PY to 6.6/100 000 PY). 
The PRAC endorses the position that confusion should no longer be under close monitoring.

Some cases indicating a causal relationship with agomelatine. 
S1000****  
This case was received from a Psychiatrist.  
The patient was a 65-year-old female with a medical history of Cerebrovascular accident in SEP-
2009. She was treated with VALDOXAN 25mg daily for Anxious depression since 2010 (exact start 
date unknown). On 23-AUG-2010 Valdoxan daily dosage was increased to 50mg.  
Concomitant treatments included Calcitriol, Calcium, Levothyroxine, Acetylsalicylic acid (75mg daily 
since SEP-2009), Atorvastatin, Valproate (750mg daily since JUN-2004), Zolpidem and Cafeine / 
Dextropropoxyphene / Paracetamol.  
Previous antidepressant treatment included Fluoxetine which was progressively withdrawn.  
In 2010, in the month after the increase of Valdoxan daily dosage to 50mg, she experienced Ear 
buzzing and ringing. She also experienced Electric shock and tingling sensation in head.  
Valdoxan was decreased to 25 mg daily. Ten days after the dose decrease, she experienced an 
Anxiodepressive reaction.  
Ear buzzing and ringing, Electric shock and tingling sensation in head improved.  
Valdoxan was increased again to 50 mg daily. Symptoms reoccurred (Positive rechallenge).

Not recovered at the time of the report  
Company’s comment: Patient with a medical history of recent cerebrovascular accident. The 
possibility that tinnitus was a sequelae of this accident was not excluded. 
S1200**** 
This case was received from Regulatory Authorities.The patient was a 48-year-old female patient 
with an unknown medical history.She has been treated with VALDOXAN 25 mg (25 mg daily) since 
10-NOV-2011 for depression. Valdoxan was initiated the same day as the patient was hospitalised 
for an unknown reason.Concomitant medications, if any, were not reported.VALDOXAN daily 
dosage was increased to 50mg daily at a not specified date.Since 10-NOV-2011, the patient 
experienced tinnitus.On 01-DEC-2011, she experienced hearing decreased.On 30-JAN-2012, 
VALDOXAN 50mg daily was stopped.Outcome: Recovering since 30-JAN-2012.Suspected 
medications (with imputability) according to the Regulatory Authority (doubtful): VALDOXAN 25 mg 
(C2,S1,I1).  
Protocol CLE-20098-068*. [Observational cohort study to evaluate the safety of Agomelatine in 
standard medical practice in depressed patients. A prospective, observational (non-interventional), 
international, multicentre cohort study.] Post Authorisation Study.The patient was a 46-year old 
male with a medical history of borreliosis since 2004 and depression. No alcohol, no tobacco 
consumption. He had been treated with VALDOXAN (25 mg daily) since 17-DEC-2011 for 
depression.Previous treatment included Amitriptyline (dose unknown) from 01-JUL-2008 to 17-
DEC-2010 for depression.In DEC-2010, shortly after Valdoxan initiation, the patient complained of 
tinnitus in both ears. A block of atlanto-occipital joints was suspected. Additionally, migraine was 
suspected.VALDOXAN was stopped on 31-JAN-2011. Treatment with Amitryptilin was re-introduced 
(dosages, treatment dates not available).Recovered. Investigator's opinion (31-MAR-2011): 
assessed this case as serious (medically important) and related to Valdoxan due to the time 
coherence.The questions wether an underlying reason for tinnitus had been found or wether 
problems with the atlanto-occipital joints could be confirmed, were declared as unsolvable by the 
investigator. 
PRAC comments: 
Despite some confounding factors, cases of tinnitus above indicate a possible relationship with 
agomelatine. 
Two additional cases have been reported after the signal was closed, and the total number of cases 
is now 54. 
The incidence of tinnitus has increased since the last PSUR period (from 5.3/100 000 PY  to 6.1/100 
000) PY. 
About half of the events occurred within few days (up to one week) after introducing agomelatine. 
There are two cases with positive rechallenge, and 18 with positive dechallenge. Four patients had 
a favourable outcome (recovered or recovering) while agomelatine was maintained at the same 
dosage. 
As stated by the MAH, tinnitus may be associated with depression. Other confounding factors are 
discussed by the MAH and include tinnitus in the medical history, hypertension, concomitant drugs 
and recent withdrawal of other antidepressant therapy 
Clinical trial data based on IAS 2012, show no significant difference in the incidence of tinnitus 
between agomelatine and placebo. However, data indicates a trend that the incidence is higher in 
the agomelatine-group vs placebo group (1,57% vs. 0.81% in the OSS and 0,30% vs. 0,21% in the 
OSS DB PC-set, respectively). 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013

Analysis of the MAH’s database shows disproportionality concerning reports of tinnitus between 
agomelatine and all the other Servier’s drugs (0,35% and 0,16%, respectively).  
Tinnitus is labeled for SSRIs and TCAs.  
Considering the totality of the available data the PRAC considers that there is sufficient information 
to conclude that a causal relationship between agomelatin and tinnitus is at least a reasonable 
possibility. It is suggested that tinnitus should be included in SPC 4.8 as a common adverse 
reaction. 
Pancreatitis 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 19/73 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
The cumulative incidence of pancreatitis is 2.1 /100 000 PY compared with 2.3 /100 000 PY after 
the previous PSUR (5) period. 
The PRAC agrees with the MAH that in some cases, the diagnosis of pancreatitis cannot be 
confirmed, as sufficient investigations are lacking. In at least two cases, the diagnosis of 
pancreatitis can be excluded.  
One patient was diagnosed with exudative pancreatitis (several drugs could be suspected). 
Agomelatine was reintroduced, and the patient was discharged after two weeks in hospital 
(negative rechallenge). 
In one case the patient had previously experienced alcoholic pancreatitis, as well as toxic 
pancreatitis related to olanzapine. 
In another case exudative pancreatitis was diagnosed after the first intake of agomelatine. 
The PRAC accepts the MAH’s conclusion that so far there is little evidence to support an 
association between agomelatine and pancreatitis. However, due to the severity of this condition, 
the PRAC considers that pancreatitis should remain under close monitoring.

S1100**** – positive rechallenge 
This case was received from the Regulatory Authorities and then from a Psychiatrist.  
The patient was a 78-year-old female with a medical history of microvascular ischaemia, 
depression and hyponatraemia with previous antidepressant (Mirtazapine). She had been treated 
with VALDOXAN (25 mg daily) for depression since the beginning of 2011. Concomitant treatments 
included Acetylsalicylic acid, Ramipril, Alendronate, Latanoprost / Timolol, Calcium and 
Ciprofloxacin (1000mg daily).  
On 03-JUN-2011, she experienced hyponatraemia (no biological value reported). The patient was 
admitted to hospital and VALDOXAN was stopped. No treatment was prescribed. Recovered on 12-
JUN-2011 (positive dechallenge). VALDOXAN (50 mg daily) was reintroduced on 13-JUN-2011 and 
blood sodium decreased again (positive rechallenge).  
VALDOXAN was stopped and the patient was discharged without any antidepressant. Recovered. 
According to the physician, the patient was vulnerable to low sodium levels. Company’s comment: 
Patient with a medical history of hyponatraemia and concomitantly treated with Alendronate, which 
is known to induce hyponatraemia.

S1200****-positive rechallenge 
This case was received from the Regulatory Authorities.The patient was a 67-year-old female with 
a medical history of arterial hypertension. She has been treated since 11-APR-2012 with 
VALDOXAN (25 mg daily), associated with OLMESARTAN / HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE (40 mg / 12.5 
mg daily), FUROSEMIDE, Potassium, Nebivolol, Risedronic acid and Tramadol / Paracetamol since 
2005. No information on previous medication, if any.  
In APR-2010, blood sodium was normal.  
On 27-APR-2012, lab tests showed blood sodium 119 mmol/L.  
 On 28-APR-2012, lab tests showed blood sodium 109 mmol/L. The patient was hospitalized for 
hyponatraemia. OLMESARTAN / HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE was stopped.  
Blood sodium then increased to 128mmol/L on 08-MAY-2012.  
VALDOXAN was stopped on 09-MAY-2012. FUROSEMIDE was maintained. Blood sodium then 
increased to 139mmol/L on 17-MAY-2012 (136 mmol/L on 24-MAY-2012).  
The patient was discharged on 01-JUN-2012 and VALDOXAN was reintroduced.  
On 11-JUN-2012, the patient was hospitalized for disturbance of consciousness (Glasgow 12) and 
general physical health deterioration. Blood sodium was 103 mmol/L. Natriuresis 69 mmol/L. 
Consciousness state then worsened with onset of coma (Glasgow 8). Sodium (IV) was prescribed.  
On 13-JUN-2012, blood sodium was 136 mmol/L. The patient presented with left basal 
pneumopathy.  
On 16-JUN-2012, the situation worsened and the patient died on 17-JUN-2012. Fatal outcome.  
Suspected medications (with imputability) according to the Regulatory Authority for the event 
"Hyponatremia": VALDOXAN (C3, S1, I3)/Likely, OLMESARTAN / HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE (C1, S2, 
I1)/doubtful  and FUROSEMIDE (C1, S2, I1)/doubtful.  
S1200**** – positive dechallenge 
This case was received from a Psychiatrist. The patient was a 60-year-old female patient with a 
medical history of alcoholism and depression. She has been treated with VALDOXAN 25 mg (25 mg 
daily) for depression since JAN-2012. Concomitant medications included: Hydroxyzine and 
Zolpidem, indication, daily dose and start date were not reported. At initiation of treatment with 
VALDOXAN 25 mg, laboratory values were normal, including blood sodium ( actual values were not 
provided). On an unspecified date at the end of FEB-2012, the patient experienced hyponatremia 
(120 mmol/L). In FEB-2012, VALDOXAN 25 mg was stopped. Two weeks after VALDOXAN 25 mg 
withdrawal, blood sodium was within the normal range (values were not provided). Outcome: 
Recovered. 
PRAC comments: 
In most of the cases agomelatine can possibly be related to hyponatraemia. However, it is 
recognized that most cases have confounding factors, like use of  other substances being 
associated with hyponatraemia (for instance diuretics and antidepressants). This also applies to the 
three cases with positive rechallenge, although agomelatine remains the main suspected agent. 
Some of the patients had a medical history making them vulnerable to hyponatraemia. In four 
cases outcome was favourable although agomelatine was maintained at the same dose.  
The MAH informed that six additional reports have been received after the above analysis, but 
considered that they did not raise any new safety concern. Accordingly, the total number of 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 23/73 
 
 
 
hyponatraemia cases reported to the MAH was thirty (30). 
The cumulative incidence since MA is 3.1/100 000 PY (2.9/100 000 PY in the previous PSUR (5) 
period. 
Hyponatraemia is a potential serious condition. Clinical trial data based on IAS 2012, show no 
significant difference in the incidence of hyponatraemia between agomelatine (0.06%) and placebo 
group (0%). 
Considering the totality of the available data, the PRAC considered that there was some evidence 
indicating a causal relationship between agomelatine and hyponatraemia. To further elucidate this 
issue, the MAH was asked to submit all narratives that had previously not been submitted, 
including narratives for the six new cases of hyponatraemia. 
Hyponatraemia is labeled for SSRIs and SNRIs.

Presentation of some cases: 
S1100**** – positive rechallenge 
This case was received from a Psychiatrist.  
The patient was a 44-year-old female, with a medical history of insufficiently controlled 
hypotension, hyperthyroidism, anaemia with severe fatigue, depressive episode and epilepsy 
(treated by antiepileptics in the past). She was treated with VALDOXAN 25mg daily for depression 
since 05-MAY-2011.  
In 2003, neurological examination was performed and the diagnosis of epilepsy was not confirmed. 
As a consequence, antiepileptics were stopped. But the patient still experienced epilepsy crisis from 
time to time (the last one in MAR-2011).  
After Valdoxan introduction, on 17-MAY-2011 the patient had an episode of epilepsy, or a cardiac 
syncope (according to the physician from the emergency department). Neurological and cardiologic 
investigations were performed. The diagnosis of epilepsy was not confirmed, but could not be 
excluded. VALDOXAN was stopped and no new epileptic episode occurred.  
After re-introduction of Valdoxan by the patient's initiative, a new epileptic episode occurred. 
(Positive rechallenge). The reporter wondered if Valdoxan could have lowered the convulsive 
threshold in this patient (suspected mechanism).  
VALDOXAN was maintained.  
Recovered.  
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 25/73 
 
 
 
 
 
Company’s comment: Patient with a medical history of convulsions. Investigations performed were 
not conclusive. Epilepsy (occurring before Valdoxan initiation) was not excluded. 
PRAC comments: 
A positive rechallenge was seen. However, agomelatine was maintained, and no information about 
the outcome is available 
S1101**** – positive dechallenge: 
This case was received from a Physician. The patient was a 50-year-old female, with a medical 
history of depression and epilepsy for years (date of onset unspecified). She had been treated with 
VALDOXAN (25 mg daily), for depression, since OCT-2011 (exact date unknown). No previous 
antidepressant medication. Concomitant medications included Levetiracetam (2000 mg daily) and 
Carbamazepine (600 mg daily), as long-term treatment of epilepsy. Under these treatments, the 
patient was free of attacks for a long time.In OCT-2011, one week after Valdoxan initiation, the 
patient experienced generalized seizure attacks with unconsciousness, urine loss and mucosal bites 
up to three times a week. VALDOXAN was stopped in NOV-2011, after two weeks of treatment. No 
seizure occurred since then (recovered). The reporter assessed the event as life-threatening.  
S1200****- positive dechallenge: 
This case was received from a Physician. The patient was a 47-year-old female with no relevant 
medical history. She has been treated since 03-APR-2012 with VALDOXAN (25 mg daily) for 
depression. No concomitant medication was reported. On 29-APR-2012, the patient was 
hospitalised for epilepsy. Neurological exam and ECG were normal. VALDOXAN was stopped. 
Outcome: Recovered.  
PRAC comments:  
Additional three cases were been reported after the MAH’s analysis. Accordingly, a total of 36 
cases of convulsions have been reported since MA. The cumulative incidence since grant of MA is 
4.3/ 100 000 PY (4.7/100 000 PY following the previous PSUR (5) period). 
The conclusion whether agomelatine can induce convulsions is a difficult one to make.  
Nearly half of the cases occurred within the first week of therapy which can support an 
association. Twelve (12) patients had epilepsy/convulsions in their medical history. However, 
information is often insufficient to evaluate whether the condition was under control before 
agomelatine was introduced. At least one patient(S1101**** – described above) had been stabile 
on anticonvulsant therapy for a long time, but experienced several generalized seizure attacks 
with unconsciousness after starting with agomelatine. The reporter assessed the reactions as life-
threatening. The patient recovered upon agomelatine withdrawal.  
In some cases the patient had recently stopped taking SSRI before agomelatine was introduced 
with possible impact on their threshold for convulsions. 
Out of the 38 cases of Convulsion received since Market Authorisation, 4 patients had a 
favourable outcome (recovered or recovering) while Agomelatine was maintained at the same 
dosage (narratives not provided). 
Clinical trial data based on IAS 2012, show no significant difference in the incidence of convulsions 
between agomelatine and placebo. However, data indicates a trend that the incidence is higher in 
the agomelatine-group (0.06%) vs placebo group (0%). 
Convulsions is labeled for SSRIs and SNRIs. 
Considering the totality of the available data the PRAC considered that there was sufficient 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 26/73 
 
 
 
information to conclude that a causal relationship between agomelatine and convulsions is at least 
a reasonable possibility. It was suggested that convulsions should be included in SPC 4.8 as a rare 
adverse reaction. 
Myalgia 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 27/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
Seven cases were reported after the MAH’s analysis was performed. The cumulative incidence since 
MA was 8.1/100 000 PY (no data available from the last PSUR (5) period). 
Myalgia may be associated with depression and is otherwise prevalent in the population. 
Accordingly, it was difficult to evaluate whether agomelatine can provoke myalgia in depressed 
patients.  
Based on pooled clinical data (IAS 2012), no significant difference between agomelatine and 
placebo was seen regarding incidence of myalgia.  
The PRAC considered that myalgia should no longer be under close monitoring.  
Increased blood pressure 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 28/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
The total number of cases were 87 (6 cases reported after the analysis was performed). The 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 29/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cumulative incidence since grant of MA had increased since the last PSUR (5) period (from 
8.4/100 000 PY to 10.6/100 000 PY). 
Positive rechallenge was reported in four cases. 31% had hypertension in their medical history. 
The PRAC agrees with the MAH’s conclusion that many cases are poorly documented. According to 
the MAH 43% of the cases did not present any blood pressure values, and 75% of cases did not 
have base line values.  
No significant difference in incidence of increased blood pressure was seen between agomelatine 
and placebo in pooled clinical data (IAS 2012).However, data indicateed a trend that the incidence 
was higher in the agomelatine group. 
The PRAC considered that increased blood pressure should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Bilirubin increased 
The MAH was requested to pay special attention to cases of bilirubin > 2ULN concomitant with 
ALAT and/or ASAT > 3ULN,  because such cases may predict serious drug-induced liver injuries. 
In PSUR 6, the MAH did not presented any analysis of bilirubin increase, but listed blood bilirubin 
increase as a closed signal. 
PRAC comments: 
The MAH presented cases with bilirubin > 2 ULN with concomitant increase > 3 ULN of ASAT/ALAT 
together  with  the  data  on  hepatotoxicity  in  the  PSUR.  Additionally,  as  jaundice  was  listed  in  the 
SmPC, it was not considered necessary to submit any further data as requested in PAC PSU 011.1. 
Additionally,  as  bilirubin  increased  was  considered  to  fall  within  the  category  of  hepatotoxicity, 
which  was  an  important  identified  risk,  it  was  no  longer  considered  necessary  to  keep  bilirubin 
increased under close monitoring. 
MAH’s discussion on the following events under close monitoring: 
Following evaluation of PSUR (5) the MAH was asked to discuss the following events in the next 
PSUR (6): 
Alopecia, palpitations, oedema peripheral, panic attacks, muscle spasm and tremor.  
Alopecia 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 30/73 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
No alopecia was seen in non-clinical studies. 
No significant difference in incidence of alopecia was observed between agomelatine and placebo 
in IAS 2012. 
The PRAC considered that alopecia should no longer remain under close monitoring.

PRAC comments: 
The total number of cases were 76 (8 cases reported after the MAH’s analysis was performed). 
A significantly higher incidence of events was seen for agomelatine compared to placebo based on 
OSS. However, based on the OSS DB PC, no significant differences were seen. As the last 
mentioned safety set corresponds to a set of patients with the same treatment duration, this 
safety set was considered to be the most appropriate. 
The PRAC considered that palpitations should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Oedema peripheral

Page 33/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
The total number of events was 40 (eight cases reported after finalization of the analysis). 
No significant difference in incidence of oedema peripheral was seen between agomelatine and 
placebo based on pooled clinical data (IAS 2012). 
The PRAC considered that oedema peripheral should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Panic attacks

PRAC comments: 
The total number of cases were 41 (6 cases reported after finalization of the analysis). 
No significant difference in incidence of panic attacks was seen between agomelatine and placebo 
based on pooled clinical data (IAS 2012). 
The PRAC considered that panic attacks should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Muscle spasm

PRAC comments: 
The total number of cases was 40 ( 4 cases reported after finalization of the analysis). 
No significant difference in incidence of muscle spasm was seen between agomelatine and placebo 
based on pooled clinical data (IAS 2012).However, it is a trend that the incidence is higher in the 
agomelatine group. 
The PRAC considered that muscle spasm should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Tremor 
PRAC comments: 
The total number of reports was 65 (11 cases reported after MAHs analysis). 
No significant difference in incidence of tremor was seen between agomelatine and placebo based 
on pooled clinical data (IAS 2012). 
The PRAC considered that tremor should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Other unlisted events 
In the AR of PSUR 5, the MAH was requested to answer the following questions: 
- 
In the next PSUR a cumulative overview of cases of thrombocytopenic purpura should 
be submitted. The MAH should consider whether there is sufficient evidence that 
information about this events should be included in the SPC/PIL. 
Valdoxan/Thymanax

Page 36/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
In the next PSUR a cumulative overview of cases of possible interactions with warfarin 
and other anticoagulants should be submitted. The MAH should consider whether there 
is sufficient evidence that this event should be informed about  in the SPC/PIL. 
- 
In the next PSUR the MAH should provide an overview of the cumulative number of 
photosensitivity reported and discuss causality with agomelatine. 
Trombocytopenic purpura

Page 37/73 
 
 
 
 
 
PRAC comments: 
The MAH informed about two cases with positive dechallenge. No narratives were provided. 
Overall, the evidence was not considered sufficient to conclude on an association between 
agomelatine and thrombocytopenic purpura. 
The MAH was requested to keep thrombocytopenic purpura under close monitoring. 
Drug interaction with anticoagulants

PRAC comments: 
No narratives were submitted, making it impossible to evaluate these cases. However, the 
committee was aware of a serious case of interaction between agomelatine and warfarin, with an 
increased INR three days after agomelatine introduction (F/42 years old). It was not clear whether 
this case was included in the MAH’s database. 
It was recommended that narratives be provided to investigate this highly important issue. 
Drug interactions with anticoagulants should be held under close monitoring.

PRAC comments: 
Information on the case reports was insufficient. In addition, it was not possible to draw any 
conclusion regarding causality with agomelatine from the IAS. 
For the period from the last PSUR only two cases of photosensitivity were reported. The majority of 
the reported events were classified as non-serious. Consequently, the PRAC considered that 
photosensitivity should no longer be under close monitoring. 
Restless leg syndrome 
Restless leg syndrome has been generated as a signal in the MAH’s database in this PSUR period:

PRAC comments: 
A significant difference in incidence between the agomelatine group and the placebo group in both 
IAS and OSS PC DBS was found. The PRAC supported the MAH’s conclusion on the RLS, and a SPC 
update to include restless leg syndrome as an ADR in section 4.8 within this PSUR procedure was 
endorsed.  
Evaluation of risks and new information 
The following events were under close monitoring in the PSUR period: 
Confusion, tinnitus, pancreatitis, hyponatraemia/SIADH, convulsion, blood bilirubin increased, 
muscular events and blood pressure increased, urticaria, alopecia, palpitations, oedema peripheral, 
panic attacks, muscle spasm and tremor. 
Urticaria had been included in section 4.8 of the SPC in the context of angioedema being generated 
as a signal in the EV database. 
For the other events, the MAH performed comprehensive signal evaluations. 
Based on the review of these data, and with emphasis on the Integrated Analysis of Safety (IAS), 
the PRAC considered that the following events should no longer be under close monitoring: 
Confusion, myalgia, blood pressure increased, blood bilirubin increased, alopecia, 
palpitations, oedema peripheral, panic attacks, muscle spasm and tremor. 
For the events tinnitus and convulsions, the PRAC considered that evidence was sufficient for 
these events to be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a respective update of the package 
leaflet to follow.  
The PRAC considered that there was some evidence indicating that agomelatine could induce 
hyponatraemia. However, this needed to be elucidated in more detail. The MAH was asked to 
submit narratives of cases that had previously not been submitted, including narratives of the 
latest reported cases. 
Pancreatitis should remain under close monitoring. 
Additionally, thrombocytopenic purpura and drug interactions with anticoagulants should 
be included as events under close monitoring. 
Restless leg syndrome was generated as a signal in the MAH’s database. The PRAC 
recommended that restless leg syndrome be added in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a respective 
update of the package leaflet to follow.  
Restless leg syndrome, tinnitus and convulsions should be classified in the category “other risk”.

Characterisation of risks  
Important identified risk - Hepatotoxicity 
Evaluation of post-marketing data from PSUR 6: 
Overall, 12 cases of severe hepatic dysfunction (hepatic failure or cases not reported as hepatic 
failure, but with evocative signs and symptoms of severe hepatic dysfunction such as 
encephalopathy, coagulation disorders) were received cumulatively. Eight (8) of these cases had 
been assessed by the CHMP during the assessment of PSUR 5 and the type II variation submitted 
following the conclusions of PSUR 5. The remaining 4 cases were presented by the MAH in PSUR 6: 
S1201****In this case, a 90 year old woman with moderate overweight and a past medical history 
of hypertension, prinzmetal’s angina, polyarthrosis and retinal ablation. The patient also had a 
recent history of GI bleeding following intake of NSAIDs (with abnormal clotting, INR 1.5, 
protrhombin time 51 %) and worsening of the general condition. Agomelatine was started at 25 mg 
daily. The patient used concomitant medications such as NSAIDs, hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide, 
oxazepam, pantoprazole, metoprolol, melperone and ramipril. Approximately one month after first 
intake of agomelatine there was a increase of ALT to 19 ULN, AST to 7.5 ULN, GGT 12 ULN and a 
concomitant increase in leucocytes count to 14 300 , CRP to 6.2 and a decrease in natreamia to 
128. Prothrombin time was 48 %. Agomelatine was stopped and transaminase level rapidly 
improved; 3 days after last intake of agomelatine ALT was 10.5 ULN and AST 1.7 ULN. 4 days later 
the patient died. The MAH considers that a lot of confounding factors could be incriminated, more 
likely than Agomelatine to be responsible for liver enzyme disturbances such as numerous 
concomitant treatments, hyponatremia suggesting hydro-electric disturbances, cardiovascular 
events with ischemic liver. The death is not related to liver failure (no bilirubin elevation) but more 
probably to the general and cardiovascular condition. The MAH has assessed the case as possibly 
related to agomelatine.  
S1300****:  
This case concerns a male patient between 50 and 60 years old. The patient had a medical history 
of depression and chronic alcohol intake for many years. He has been treated since an unspecified 
date in 2011 with agomelatine (dose unspecified) for depression. No information on previous or 
concomitant medication, if any. No information on liver function tests at baseline, if performed. On 
an unspecified date (possibly in the end of 2011), lab tests showed increased liver enzymes 
(Increased transaminases, not "very high" according to the reporter). Agomelatine was stopped 
after one or two months of treatment. The patient was admitted to hospital one week later for 
suspicion of liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis (previously not diagnosed). He presented with 
coagulopathy (increase of Prothrombin time, no information on Factor V). No information on clinical 
signs (including icterus). The patient was transferred from the Geriatric Unit to the 
Gastroenterology Unit, where he eventually died a few days later. No liver biopsy was performed. 
No autopsy was performed. No further information was available. Outcome: Fatal. According to the 
reporter, the transaminase increase was related to the alcoholic cirrhosis. In a follow up 
information the reporter was eventually not sure that the patient died. The MAH has assessed this 
case as not assessable. 
S1300****: 
This case concerns a 42 year old female patient with an unspecified medical history treated with 
agomelatine 25 mg daily for an unspecified indication. One week after initiation of treatment, the 
patient was hospitalized for massive paracetamole intake with suicidal intention. AST was 6646 
IU/L and ALT 4890 IU/L. The patient was jaundiced with impaired consciousness and INR of 6.28. 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 43/73 
 
 
 
Fatal outcome occurred 8 days after the patient was admitted to hospital. The MAH has assessed 
the case as not related to agomelatine. 
S1300**** 
This case concerns a 45 year female patient with medical history if obesity, sleeve gastrectomy 
followed by gastric by-pass, alcoholism and chronic hepatitis B infection treated with entecavir. 
HBV replication was reported to be well controlled. She has been treated since an unspecified date 
with VALDOXAN (dose and indication were not specified). Concomitant treatment included 
Entecavir for hepatitis B. No information on previous medication, if any. No information on baseline 
lab tests, if performed. In FEB-2013, three to four months after Valdoxan initiation, the patient was 
hospitalized for encephalopathy, confusion, AST increase (800-1000 IU/L), slight ALT increase 
(around 100 IU/L), Prothrombin level 28%, ALP increase and GGT increase. Lab tests showed no 
paracetamol in blood. No information regarding viral serologies, except negative hepatitis B viral 
load. The patient was treated with Lactulose, with positive effect on encephalopathy. As lab tests 
then showed worsening of Prothrombin level decrease and AST increase, the patient was 
transferred to the intensive care unit. Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed (with severe CPK increase). 
The patient presented with hepatic insufficiency, pneumopathy and multiorgan insufficiency. Liver 
biopsy showed deterioration of liver, with severe hepatic fibrosis. The patient eventually died on 
06-FEB-2013 in a context of cardiovascular failure and multiorgan insufficiency. No further 
information available. Fatal outcome. According to the GP, liver function tests were prescribed and 
performed (no other informations).  
The MAH assessed the case as follows:  
Serum bilirubin is unavailable, but we are told she had conjunctival icterus (i.e. jaundice). Taken 
together, the normal ALT, elevated AST and high AST:ALT ratio with jaundice, low serum albumin 
and prolonged prothrombin time suggests to us that she has alcoholic hepatitis possibly with 
disseminated intravascular coagulation. The later liver histology which showed steatohepatitis is 
consistent with this diagnosis. The patient was transferred to another department at the university 
hospital due to liver and respiratory failure developing severe bilateral pneumonia: criteria for 
ARDS are well documented clinically, and by laboratory and CT scan findings. 
At initial hospital admission the aminotransferase were normal or only moderately increased for 
AST (probably 2-3xULN) while features for marked liver dysfunction were present (prothrombin 
and factor V levels below 30% of normal). The PT level may also be decreased in patients with 
disseminated intravascular coagulation. CT scan reportedly showed enlarged fatty liver without 
evidence for portal hypertension. Necropsy a few days later apparently showed steatohepatitis with 
portal and sinusoidal fibrosis. 
These findings indicate that severe liver disease was present when the patient developed 
pneumonia. The features are characteristic for alcoholic liver disease [moderately increased 
aminotransferase (AST>ALT)] potentiated by obesity. The fact that the patient had stopped taking 
alcohol 3-4 weeks earlier does not rule out this diagnosis, particularly in the context of obesity. 
Although chronic hepatics B might have participated in causing fibrosis, the description of the 
lesions found at necropsy suggests that viral replication was actually well controlled, as otherwise 
indicated by undetectable HBV DNA in serum. The low level of ALT is unusual for an agomelatine-
induced liver injury. 
Thereafter, the patient developed circulatory failure combined with anemia (hemoglobin level 5.7 
mmol/L) and respiratory failure. The development of severe hypotension and hypoxemia secondary 
to ARDS and anemia fully explains the subsequent marked increase in serum aminotransferase 
levels due to ischemic (or hypoxic) hepatitis as well as multiorgan failure and death. Hypoxic 
hepatitis has been well documented by post mortem findings in the liver. What is not completely 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 44/73 
 
 
 
clear is whether bacterial infection was responsible for bilateral pneumonia. Bacterial infection is 
extremely common in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Although the responsibility of 
agomelatine, as aggravating factor cannot be ruled out, its responsibility would be unlikely. 
The MAH concluded that the case was unlikely related to agomelatine. 
PRAC comments: 
The PRAC considered that one case had a temporal relationship between agomelatine and the 
observed increase in transaminases. However, due to the serious underlying diseases and several 
concomitant treatments, causality with agomelatine could not be established. In another case it 
was agreed with the MAH that the case report did not include enough information to assess 
causality, whereas in a third case the observed event of liver failure was likely due to paracetamol 
overdose and not related to agomelatine. In the last case the history of alcohol abuse and hepatitis 
B precluded the assessment of causality with agomelatine. The AST/ALT-ratio of more than 2:1 
may be suggestive of alcoholic injury. However, a possible role of agomelatine as having an 
additive effect, could not be ruled out, due to the observed temporal relationship. 
Overall, the 4 cases of severe hepatic dysfunction received during the reporting period and not 
previously assessed by the CHMP, included several confounding factors making it difficult to 
evaluate the causality with agomelatine. It was concluded that these cases were not considered to 
add any new knowledge with regards to the hepatotoxic potential of agomelatine.  
During the reporting period of PSUR 6, 57 cases were received reported as hepatitis or with a 
transamine increase > 10 ULN and/or transaminase increase > 3 ULN, with concomitant bilirubin 
increase > 2 ULN. In these cases the daily dosage of agomelatine was 25 mg in 29 of the cases 
(51%), 50 mg in 20 cases (35%), 75 mg in 1 case and not specified in the remaining 7 cases. 28 
of the patients had a medical history of alcoholism and/or obesity/overweight and/or transaminase 
increase and/or another risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), such as hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia or diabetes mellitus. In 5 of the cases (9%) agomelatine was taken 
concomitantly with medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury.  
The time to onset of these cases was from 1 day to 22 months, with 19 (33 %) of the events 
occurring between 6 and 12 weeks after agomelatine initiation.  
According to the MAH’s evaluation, in 10 of the 57 cases (18 %) the SmPC guidance was not 
adequately followed as agomelatine was not immediately stopped despite the occurrence of 
biological and/or clinical signs of potential liver injury. According to the MAH the outcome was 
favourable in 24 cases (16 patients recovered, 8 patients recovering), were the SmPC guideline 
was followed. 
The MAH’s group of experts, the Liver Safety Committee considered that 1 case was not 
assessable, 2 cases not related to agomelatine, in 3 cases agomelatines role was assessed as 
probable, and in 19 as possible. The remaining 23 cases have not yet been evaluated by the MAH’s 
expert group.  
PRAC comments: 
The serious hepatotoxic reactions presented in these reports caused concern. However, as such 
reactions have been known to occur with agomelatine, they were not considered to add any new 
information on the safety profile of agomelatine. In the previous PSUR period (PSUR 5), there were 
45 cases of hepatitis, transaminases > 10 ULN and/or transaminases > 3 ULN with concomitant 
bilirubin increase > 2 ULN. The number of reports in PSUR 6 was slightly higher with 57 cases, 
however this could be explained by higher exposure to agomelatine in the period of PSUR 6, along 
with increased attention on reporting following the dissemination of the DHPC and updated 
educational material towards the end of 2012. As the data lock point for PSUR 6 was 19.02.2013, 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 45/73 
 
 
 
only 4 months after the dissemination of the DHPC and updated educational material, the risk 
minimisation measures were not expected to had had any major impact on reducing the number of 
serious hepatotoxic reactions or improving compliance with the SmPC at the time of DLP of PSUR 
6.  
It was noted that the adherence to the SmPC guideline was associated with a favourable outcome 
in 66 % of these cases. This emphasizes the importance of strictly complying with the guidance in 
the SmPC. In its assessment of cases of non-compliance with the SmPC, the MAH has focused on 
cases were recommendations in section 4.4 to immediately stop treatment with agomelatine 
following occurrence of biological and/or clinical signs of potential liver injury were not followed. 
However, there was no analysis of whether liver function tests has been performed according the 
guidance of the SmPC. Early detection of potential liver injury is also of outmost importance to 
reduce the severity of hepatotoxic reactions. When analyzing the effect of risk minimisation and 
compliance to the SmPC in future reports, the MAH was advised to include an analysis of whether 
liver function tests have been performed according to the SmPC.  
Additionally, the MAH was asked in the Assessment Report for the previous PSUR (PSUR 5) to 
provide follow up information about 6 cases of hepatitis that were not evaluated in PSUR 5 due to 
lack of documentation. Of these 6 cases, 1 poorly documented case has not yet been evaluated by 
the MAH’s expert committee. 3 poorly documented cases were considered closed as the reporters 
refused to provide additional information. These cases were evaluated as not assessable. The 
remaining 2 cases were evaluated as possible related to agomelatine in one case, and unlikely 
related in the last case. Overall, the MAH considered that these cases did not have any impact on 
the overall conclusion of the last PSUR.  
PRAC comments: 
It was agreed that these cases did not impact the overall conclusion of the last PSUR. Hepatitis is 
listed as an adverse event in the SmPC of agomelatine. 
In addition to the cases presented in the above categories, there were 69 cases of transaminases > 
3 ULN reported in the period covered by PSUR 6. This is similar to the reporting in the previous 
PSUR (PSUR 5), were 77 cases of transaminases increased > 3 ULN was reported. The MAH’s 
analysis of the cases from PSUR 6 showed that in 15 of these 69 cases the SmPC guideline to 
discontinue agomelatine was not followed, whereas of the 38 cases were the SmPC guidance was 
followed, 26 cases had a favourable outcome.  
PRAC comments: 
As  with  the  more  severe  reactions  presented  above,  these  cases  emphasized  the  importance  of 
adherence to the SmPC guideline. Overall, the reporting of increased transaminases > 3 ULN was 
similar  to  the  incidence  in  previous  PSURs,  thus  no  new  information  on  the  safety  profile  of 
agomelatine was identified from these reports. 
In the Final Assessment Report to PSUR 5, the MAH was asked to provide follow up information of 
36 cases of ASAT/ALAT > 3 ULN that were not evaluated in PSUR 5 due to lack of documentation. 
Of these 36 cases 4 poorly documented cases were not submitted to the MAH at the time of data 
lock point of PSUR 6. 6 cases were considered closed as the reporters refused to provide additional 
information. These cases were evaluated as not assessable. In the remaining 26 cases, the role of 
agomelatine was assessed as probable in 4 cases, possible in 11 cases, unlikely in 9 cases and 2 
cases were assessed as not related to agomelatine. The MAH considers that these cases did not 
change the overall conclusion of PSUR 5 a conclusion that was supported by the PRAC. 
An increase was seen in the reporting of cases of transaminases ≤ 3 ULN of 49 % from 15.2/100 
000 patient years in the previous PSUR to 22.6/100 000 patient year in the period covered by this 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 46/73 
 
 
 
PSUR. This could be explained by the increased attention to reporting of hepatic adverse events 
following the dissemination of the DHPC in October 2012.  
Overall, the incidence of liver adverse events was 79.6/100 000 patient years in the period covered 
by PSUR 6, an increase from the 62.4 / 100 000 patient years reported with the previous PSUR 5. 
According to the MAH, the overall increase in cases with liver adverse events could be explained by 
the 49 % increase of incidence of cases with transaminases ≤ 3 ULN.  
PRAC comments: 
Although the incidence of liver adverse events was slightly increased from the previous PSUR, it 
should be noted that the incidence reported within this period was lower than the incidence 
reported within the PSUR preceding PSUR 5, with a incidence of 79.6/100 000 patient years in 
PSUR 6 compared to 83.4/100 000 patient years in PSUR 4. 
Overall no new findings with regards to hepatotoxicity were identified from the data presented in 
this PSUR. The reported events were similar in frequency and severity compared to previous 
PSURs. The reports of severe hepatotoxic reactions were of concern, but it was considered too 
early to evaluate the effect of the risk minimisation measures implemented following the conclusion 
of the previous PSUR (PSUR 5). 
Cumulative review 
Based on the updated overall agomelatine clinical trials database, an increased incidence (1. 75 %) 
of transaminase elevations (> 3 ULN) has been observed after administration of agomelatine 25/50 
mg (1.34 % at 25 mg/d and 2.51 % at 50 mg/d) as compared to placebo (0.50 %). In clinical 
trials, hepatic reactions observed on Agomelatine usually consist in asymptomatic isolated 
transaminases elevation in majority of patients, detectable within the first months of treatment and 
reversible after drug cessation or on treatment. When considering the patients for which a follow-
up was available on treatment, 52% of the patients who reported a transaminase elevation > 3ULN 
recovered under Agomelatine maintained treatment. No severe hepatic dysfunction has been 
reported in clinical studies. 
In post-marketing surveillance, 746 cases of Liver adverse reactions have been received since 
Market Authorisation, including 12 cases of severe hepatic dysfunction. The incidence of reported 
cases is stable since 2010, with the incidence of liver adverse events varying from 107.6/100 000 
patient years in PSUR 2 to 62.4/100 000 patient years in PSUR 5. In the 335 cases of transaminase 
increase > 3 ULN, hepatitis and/or severe hepatic dysfunction received since Market Authorisation, 
the role of Agomelatine was assessed by the Liver Safety Committee as probable in 38 cases 
(11.3%), possible in 107 cases (31.9%) and unlikely in 46 cases (13.7%). Twenty-one (21) cases 
were considered as not related to Agomelatine (6.3%), and 29 cases were considered as not 
assessable (8.7%). One case was not evaluated as there was no transaminase increase (0.3%). 
The remaining 93 cases (27.8%) were not yet evaluated at the time of this report. 
Out of the 335 patients, 244 (72.8%) were female. The ratio of female patients is slightly higher 
than in the global population of patients who presented with adverse reactions under Agomelatine 
treatment (64.6% of female). However, the gender was not specified in 4.5% of the cases of the 
global population, which constitutes a bias in the analysis. Taken into account all 746 cases of Liver 
adverse reactions, the ratio of female patients is comparable with the global population: 479 
patients out of 746 were female (64.2%, gender being not specified in 4.4% of the cases). In 
conclusion, female patients do not seem to be at higher risk of hepatic adverse reaction. 
In 34.1% of the patients who presented with hepatitis or liver failure, a Non-Alcoholic 
SteatoHepatitis (or risk factors for NASH) was reported in medical history, which is slightly less 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 47/73 
 
 
 
than in the population with isolated transaminase increase > 3 ULN (37.8%). NASH or risk factors 
for NASH do not seem to be a risk factor for more severe hepatic adverse reactions. 
In 5.6% of the patients who presented with hepatitis or liver failure, baseline lab tests showed 
elevated transaminases, which is less than in the population with isolated transaminase increase > 
3 ULN (13.4%). An abnormal baseline lab test does not seem to be a risk factor for more severe 
hepatic adverse reactions. No risk factor was identified from post-marketing surveillance. 
MAH’s conclusion: In clinical trials, hepatic reactions observed on Agomelatine usually consist in 
asymptomatic isolated transaminases elevation in majority of patients, detectable within the first 
months of treatment and reversible on treatment or after drug cessation. No severe hepatic 
dysfunction in clinical studies has been reported. The mechanism of potential liver adverse 
reactions still appears to be usually cytolytic. 
There is neither evidence of cholestatic nor of associated hypersensitivity reactions. An 
idiosyncratic mechanism is the most probable. 
Cases of liver injury, including hepatic failure, elevations of liver enzymes exceeding 10 times 
upper limit of normal, hepatitis and jaundice have been reported in patients treated with 
agomelatine in the post-marketing surveillance, but no risk factor was identified. Since cases of 
severe liver dysfunction have been reported, risk minimization measures (SPC updates, updated 
physician’s guide distribution and DHPC dissemination) have been implemented in 2012. 
In view of the above data, the MAH considered that the additional risk minimization measures 
proposed are appropriate to contribute to the optimization of benefit/risk for Agomelatine in the 
interest of the patient. 
Hepatotoxic reactions remain under close monitoring. 
PRAC comments: 
Overall, it was considered that the cumulative review of the identified risk of hepatotoxicity did not 
reveal any new information. The frequency of increased transaminases > 3 ULN is in accordance 
with the number stated in the SmPC. The reporting of liver adverse events from post marketing is 
stable, and comparable to the finding in previous PSUR intervals.  
In the conclusion of the Final Assessment Report of PSUR 5, the MAH was asked to report any 
association between slightly elevated ASAT/ALAT pre-treatment and more severe elevation later 
during treatment or post-treatment. The MAH concluded that there was no such association based 
on the fact that 5.6 % of the patients who presented with hepatic failure or hepatitis had elevated 
transaminases at baseline, compared to the population with isolated transaminases increase > 3 
ULN where the number was 13.6 %. The position of the MAH that there did not seem to be any 
clear association based on these data, was endorsed. However, due to the relatively low number of 
cases in the category with the most severe hepatic reactions, it was difficult to draw any firm 
conclusions. The MAH was advised to continue in future PSURs to analyse the reports to elucidate if 
there were any risk factors for the development of the more severe hepatoxic reactions. 
The MAH was also asked to discuss if reports of elevated ASAT/ALAT were associated with NASH 
(non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) or any of the risk factors for NASH such as hypertension, obesity, 
diabetes type II and metabolic syndrome. The MAH concluded that there was no association with 
NASH or risk factors for NASH and the most severe hepatic adverse events of hepatitis and hepatic 
failure. Among the patients presenting with hepatitis or hepatic failure, 34.1 % had NASH or risk 
factors for NASH, compared to 37,8 % of patients with isolated increases in transaminases > 3 
ULN. Again, the PRAC agreed that these data did not indicate any association between NASH or risk 
factors of NASH, and the more severe hepatic adverse events, but no firm conclusion could be 
drawn due to the relative low number of cases in the category with more severe events.  
Valdoxan/Thymanax

Additionally, the MAH was asked to calculate the incidence of hepatic adverse events in women and 
compare this with the incidence of such events in men. The MAH concluded that female patients do 
not seem to be at higher risk of hepatic adverse events. The PRAC agreed with this assessment, as 
the MAH’s analysis showed that of the 746 liver adverse events, the ratio of female patients was 
64.2 %, compared to 64. 6 % ratio of female patients for all adverse events. Thus, there did not 
seem to be any indication that females were at higher risk of hepatic adverse events.  
Important identified risk – Interactions with potent CYP 1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, 
ciprofloxacin) 
During the 48-month period of post-marketing surveillance, 5 cases of drug interaction with potent 
CYP 1A2 inhibitors (1 non-HCP) were reported, which corresponds to an estimated incidence of 0.6 
/ 100 000 patient years. Out of the 5 cases, 2 were assessed as serious. 
The outcome was recovered in 4 cases and unknown in 1 case. These cases did not provide any 
new safety insight to Agomelatine safety. 
The MAH concluded that interaction with potent CYP 1A2 inhibitors should be maintained as 
important identified risk and listed as contraindication and continue to be closely monitored. 
PRAC comments: 
The MAH’s conclusion was supported by the PRAC. No new information regarding this important 
identified risk was identified from this cumulative review. Interactions with potent CYP 1A2 
inhibitors should continue to be closely monitored, and listed in the RMP as an important identified 
risk.

PRAC comments: 
In the previous PSUR-period, the incidence of suicidal events had not increased. However, the 
incidence of the most severe events (suicide attempt and completed suicide) had increased. The 
MAH was asked to follow up and comment upon this concern in the next PSUR (6). It was 
reassuring that the incidence of all categories of suicidal events decreased in this PSUR period.

PRAC comments: 
The PRAC does not agree that the percentage of patients having attempted suicide was similar 
between the 18-30 years age group and in the > 30 years age group. 
The percentage of persons having attempted suicide was higher in  patients aged 18-30 years 
compared with patients > 30 years. However, this has been addressed in the following statement 
in the SmPC: 
“A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressants in adult patients with 
psychiatric disorders, showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants 
compared to placebo, in patients less than 25 years old.” 
Concerning elderly patients, no data have been submitted, and the risk of suicidality could not be 
assessed in this group of patients. The MAH was requested to present data in the next PSUR on the 
frequency of suicidal events in elderly people (> 65 years) and compare with frequencies in 
younger age groups. 
Important potential risk- Skin reactions 
Skin reactions have been considered as important potential risk. 
Based on the available information, the MAH proposes to no longer consider this risk as important. 
The cumulative review of cases originating from post-marketing notifications showed:  
A trend for decrease over time in frequency since Market Authorisation; the reported incidence of 
Skin reactions (serious and non-serious) reported within the last period covered (February 2012 – 
February 2013) (39.0 / 100 000 patient-years) was lower than the cumulative incidence since 
Market Authorisation (50.7 / 100 000 patient-years). 
Most of the events (87%) are non-serious: over the 48-month period of post-marketing 
surveillance, 618 skin reactions were reported in 434 patients, including 536 non serious events. 
Most of the reported events (84%) were listed events. 
Potential severe, drug-related cases were extremely rare, and in most of these cases, the diagnosis 
and / or the role of Agomelatine seemed questionable. From post-marketing surveillance, two life-
threatening events were reported: 
-  One case of Stevens Johnson Syndrome which occurred after 6 months of treatment in a 
patient concomitantly treated with quetiapine. Diagnosis was confirmed by a dermatologist 
and the role of Agomelatine was assessed as unlikely (inadequate time to onset). 
-  One case of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis which occurred after 9 days of treatment. The role 
of Agomelatine was assessed as doubtful. 
No fatal case was reported since Market authorization.

In completed clinical trials, no serious cutaneous adverse events occurred since Market 
Authorisation. 
PRAC comments: 
A prospective observational study (CLE-20098-068) was ongoing and intended among other things, 
to study skin reactions. The PRAC considered that skin reactions should be an important potential 
risk until this study is finalized in 2015. 
Important missing information – pregnancy and breastfeeding 
Since Market Authorization, 87 cases of pregnancy were reported (including 49 pregnancy follow-
ups), associated with 4 cases of breastfeeding. Patients were aged between 18 and 44 years; 21 
had history of full-term pregnancies. Among these 87 cases, 77 patients were exposed to 
Agomelatine during the 1st trimester of pregnancy; 12 during the 1st and 2nd trimester, and 7 
patients during the whole pregnancy. Four patients were only exposed to Agomelatine during the 
2nd trimester, two in the 3rd trimester and one in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. 
The pregnancy outcome was spontaneous abortion or foetal death in 9 cases, and spontaneous 
delivery without abnormalities in 35 cases. 
The MAH has concluded that no new safety insight to agomelatine safety was provided from these 
cases.  
PRAC comments: 
According to the analysis presented by the MAH, alternative causes of the observed pregnancy 
outcomes were identified in many of these cases, thus no new conclusions with regards to 
agomelatine safety in pregnancy could be drawn from these reports. Four (4) cases of drug 
exposure during breast feeding were reported. No adverse events were reported from these 4 
cases.  
Important missing information – hepatic impairment 
Since Market Authorization, 1 case was reported in a patient with a medical history of 
Hepatic impairment, from post-marketing sources. The patient had a medical history of 
hepatopathy and presented with CRP, ALT, AST and GGT increase 3 weeks after Agomelatine 
initiation. Agomelatine was stopped. The patient recovered from ALT and AST increase (recovering 
for GGT increase, unknown outcome for CRP increase). 
The MAH concluded that this case did not provide any new safety insight to Agomelatine safety. 
This was endorsed by the PRAC.  
Important missing information – severe and moderate renal impairment: 
Since Market Authorization, 19 cases were reported in patients with a medical history of 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 54/73 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment, from post-marketing sources. Out of these 19 patients, 4 presented with Liver 
adverse reactions. No event was reported more than 3 times. 
The MAH concluded that these cases did not provide any new safety insight to Agomelatine safety. 
PRAC comments: 
Cumulatively there were 19 reports of adverse events in patients with a history of renal 
impairment. There did not seem to be any pattern indicating a higher risk of a particular adverse 
event in patients with renal impairment. Overall, these data did not indicate any increased risk of 
adverse events in patient with renal impairment, however, no firm conclusions could be drawn.  
Important missing information- Elderly 
716 events have been reported cumulatively in 220 patients aged 75 years and over. The frequent 
unlisted events were confusional state (11 cases), drug ineffective (10 cases) and hyponatraemia 
(9 cases).  
Important missing information- Paedriatic population 
Cumulatively, 96 events were reported in 44 patients aged under 18 years. No risk factors can be 
derived from these data. 
Discussion and conclusion on signal and risk evaluation 
No new findings with regards to hepatotoxicity were identified from the data presented in this 
PSUR. 
Concerning the important potential risk of suicide, the updated data was reassuring. Both the 
interval reported and cumulative incidences of suicidal events decreased as compared with 
previous PSUR periods. However, the risk of suicidal events in elderly patients could not be 
assessed as no data were submitted. The MAH was asked to comment on this issue in the next 
PSUR.  
The PRAC considered that skin reactions should remain to be an important potential risk until the 
prospective observational study (CLE-20098-068) is finalized in 2015.  
The MAH was asked to include restless leg syndrome, tinnitus and convulsions as ADRs in section 
4.8 of the SPC and to update the he Package leaflet accordingly. 
There was evidence that agomelatine could induce hyponatraemia. To elucidate this further, the 
MAH was asked to submit narratives for all cases that were not submitted previously, including 
narratives for the six latest reported cases. 
No other risk minimisation activities were deemed necessary. 
Effectiveness of risk minimisation 
Additional risk minimisation measures were implemented for the important identified risk of 
hepatotoxicity. A DHPC as well as an updated educational material, were distributed towards the 
end of 2012 to inform about serious hepatic ADRs that were associated with agomelatine. 
Additionally, prescribers were advised to strictly adhere to the treatment recommendations in the 
SmPC.  
The educational material also gave information on the contraindications for the concomitant use of 
agomelatine and potent CYP 1A2 inhibitors (i.e. ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine). 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 55/73 
 
 
 
The MAH was in the process of performing a prescription survey (MEA 005) to evaluate the 
effectiveness of this risk minimisation measure. The protocol was previously approved by CHMP, 
with a planned submission date in December 2013. 
3.  Benefit evaluation 
Important baseline efficacy and effectiveness information 
Agomelatine is indicated in the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults. At the time of 
grant of marketing authorisation in 2009 the CHMP considered that the magnitude of the short-
term efficacy was not similar to the effect generally shown for the SSRIs. However, the effect 
demonstrated in the second relapse prevention study was in line with what has been shown for the 
SSRIs. The CHMP concluded that with the proposed liver monitoring program, and considering the 
otherwise favourable safety profile compared to other antidepressants, the effect magnitude 
demonstrated was sufficient to provide a clinically valuable alternative in the antidepressant 
treatment armamentarium for some patients. 
According to the MAH,  results observed with agomelatine in 6 new head-to-head short-term 
studies with different active comparators (Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, Escitalopram) support  
both the efficacy of agomelatine in MDD (HAM-D17 scale) and its magnitude of effect, being 
comparable to those of other first line reference antidepressants treatments. 
The MAH claimed that in view of the distinct pharmacological profile of agomelatine, translating 
into additional clinical benefits (early alleviation of sleep disturbances and daytime drowsiness and 
improved tolerability profile compared to the SSRI/SNRIs group) this has been enriched with new 
data on sleep and daytime functioning vs. escitalopram (Quera-Salva et al., 2011; Corruble et al., 
EPA 2011) and on emotional processing in three studies. 
Efficacy and safety of agomelatine was also investigated in patients with generalized anxiety 
disorder (GAD). Short term and long term efficacy (HAM-A scale) were demonstrated in two 
studies, according to the MAH.  
Newly identified information on efficacy and effectiveness 
Since the MA in 2009, the MAH completed 6 short-term studies (8-12 weeks duration): CL3.045, 
CL3.046, CL3.048, CL3.052, CL3.056, and CL3.063 vs. active comparators. These studies had 
not been assessed by the CHMP at the time of this report. The main efficacy results of these new 
studies are briefly discussed below. 
Study CL3.045 was a direct, short-term (8 weeks) comparison of agomelatine versus fluoxetine.  
Change on the HAMD-17 scale was the main efficacy criterion. A total of 504 patients with severe 
depression (baseline HAM-D total score ≥ 25) were enrolled in Western Europe/Latin America and 
randomised to agomelatine 25-50 mg/day or fluoxetine 20-40 mg/day. Results for the primary 
efficacy endpoint are shown in Table 1; superiority over fluoxetine was claimed (p=0.024). 
Responder rates at Week 8 are shown in Table 2. 
Study CL3.052 had a similar design as study CL3.045, but was only conducted in Asian countries. 
A total of 609 patients with severe depression were randomised to agomelatine 25-50 mg or 
fluoxetine 20-40 mg/day. Results for the primary efficacy endpoint (HAMD-17 scale) after 8 weeks 
of treatment are shown in Table 1. Non-inferiority compared to fluoxetine was claimed based on a 
pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.5 (p=0.015); superiority was not shown. Responder rates 
at Week 8 are shown in Table 2. 
In study CL3.046 agomelatine 25-50 mg/day was compared with sertraline 50-100 mg/day. A 
total of 306 patients were randomised and followed up for 6 weeks. The primary aim of this study 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 56/73 
 
 
 
was to study effects on different aspects of sleep and daytime condition; effects on depression 
were assessed with the HAMD-17 total score as a secondary endpoint (Table 1). Superiority over 
sertraline was claimed for this secondary endpoint (p<0.001). Responder rates at Week 6 are 
shown in Table 2. The short-term data from this study were already submitted during the MA 
procedure. It was concluded by the CHMP that although the magnitude of effect was considered to 
be of marginal clinical relevance (pre-specified efficacy analysis: difference HAMD-17 score = 1.68, 
p=0.031), it was concluded that agomelatine had documented some short-term efficacy. 
Study CL3.056 also aimed to study the effects of agomelatine on different aspects of sleep and 
daytime condition, and used HAMD-17 total score as a secondary efficacy criterion. In all, 129 
patients were randomised to agomelatine 25-50 mg/day or escitalopram 10-20 mg/day. Non-
inferiority, based on a pre-defined margin of 1.5, was claimed compared with escitalopram 
(p=0.002), Table 1). Superiority was not shown. Responder rates at Week 6 are listed in Table 2. 
Study CL3.063 had a similar design as study CL3.056 and aimed to study effects of agomelatine 
on various aspects of sleep and daytime condition. Changes on the HAMD-17 total score were 
assessed as a secondary efficacy criterion. Patients (n=321) were randomized to agomelatine 25-
50 mg/day or escitalopram 10-20 mg/day. Results for the secondary efficacy endpoint are shown 
in Table 1. Non-inferiority versus escitalopram was claimed (p=0.003), based on a pre-defined 
margin of 1.5. Superioriy was not shown. Responder rates at Week 12 are listed in Table 2. 
Study CL3.048 aimed at studying the quality of sleep in patients aged >60 years old, and used 
HAM-D 17 total score as a secondary efficacy criterion. A total of 403 patients with severe 
depression were randomized to either agomelatine 25-50 mg/day, or paroxetine 20-30 mg/day. 
Results for the secondary efficacy endpoint are shown in Table 1. No statistically significant 
treatment differences for antidepressant activities were seen and superiority/non-inferiority versus 
paroxetine was not claimed. Responder rates at Week 12 are shown in Table 2.

Clinical studies in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): 
During the reporting interval, in two post commitment studies, agomelatine was according to the 
MAH found to be an effective treatment of Major Depressive Episodes, either in adult (CL3.069) or 
in elderly (CL3.070) populations. In both cases, magnitudes of the effects in terms of HAM-D total 
scores or responder rates favourably compared to those reported in recently published comparable 
studies with existing SSRIs/SNRIs according to the MAH’s analysis. CL3.069 study evidenced a 
dose response for agomelatine, with both superiority of the 10 mg dose over placebo and 
superiority of agomelatine 25 mg and 25-50 mg over both agomelatine 10 mg and placebo (HAM-
D17 scale). This study confirmed the effective dosage range, with the recommended therapeutic 
doses (25 mg and 25-50 mg) being the best therapeutic options. In CL3.070 study, observed 
differences on HAM-D17 scale between agomelatine (25-50 mg) and placebo were also statistically 
significant. In the sub-population of patients under 75, i.e. the recommended target elderly 
population for agomelatine treatment, the results favourably compared with the rare positive 
studies reported with other antidepressants in similar populations (Raskin et al., 2007; Schneider 
et al., 2003; Sheikh et al., 2004; Rapaport et al., 2009; Rapaport et al., 2003; Tedeschini et al., 
2011; Katona et al., 2012) and demonstrated the antidepressant efficacy of agomelatine in elderly 
patients up to 75 years old. 
PRAC comments: 
Study CL3.069 was evaluated by the CHMP and the committee considered that the study did not 
have a design to allow conclusion regarding the efficacy of increasing the dose to 50 mg in patients 
not responding to 25 mg. For the two groups (25 mg fixed and 25-50 mg) the results were 
considered clinically relevant compared to placebo, however, the difference between the two 
groups was marginal. It was concluded that the data indicated that some patients may still benefit 
from an increased dose compared to those continuing on the 25 mg dose. However, the risk of 
liver related ADRs was increased on the higher dose. The MAH proposed the following for inclusion 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC:” Decision of dose increase has to be balanced with a higher risk 
of transaminases elevation. Any dose increase to 50 mg should be made on an individual 
patient benefit/risk basis and with strict respect of LFT monitoring.” to reflect the 
increased risk with the higher dose. This amendment was endorsed by the CHMP. Accordingly, the 
MAH was requested to apply for a type II variation to include this information in the SmPC. 
Study CL3.070 (FUM 002) was assessed by the CHMP. The aim was to study the efficacy and safety 
of agomelatine (25-50 mg/day) for 8 weeks in elderly patients suffering from MDD. A total of 218 
patients were randomized to either agomelatine 25-50 mg/day or placebo. An optional double-blind 
extension period up to 16 weeks was scheduled for this study. Out of the 222 randomised patients, 
175 (79 %) completed the mandatory W0-W8 period and 146 (66 %) entered the double-blind 
extension period. The clinical study in patients 65 years and older, revealed a statistically 
significant difference on the primary endpoint, HAM-D 17, between the agomelatine group and the 
placebo group in the full analysis set. The clinical relevance seemed modest; however, it was in line 
with the effect observed for agomelatine in other clinical studies in younger adults. On the contrary, 
no effect was documented for the sub-group of patients ≥75 years. In addition, the exposure of 
agomelatine was shown to increase several fold in this age group compared to patients <75 years. 
The MAH was requested to submit a Type II variation and the SmPC were amended in order to 
reflect the results achieved in elderly patients.  
The MAH has since grant of MA completed 9 nine new randomised double-blind studies (2 placebo-
controlled and 7 active controlled studies) including 3347 patients. In addition, 4 new studies (1 
active controlled and 3 placebo-controlled studies) enrolling a total of 1660 patients with MDD have 
been conducted in the US by a Servier licensee,. Based on an assessment of the main results of  
these 13 new clinical studies, enrolling approximately 5000 patients with MDD, the overall efficacy 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 59/73 
 
 
 
of agomelatine in the currently approved indication was considered modest, but generally in line 
with findings from previously submitted and assessed studies that formed the basis for the EU 
approval in 2009. However, in some studies treatment with agomelatine was not superior to 
placebo and/or an active control (SSRI/SRNI). 
Characterisation of benefits 
Overall, following the evaluation of studies submitted since grant of MA, the efficacy in the 
approved indication was considered modest, but in line with findings from the studies forming the 
basis for the EU approval in 2009. 
During the reporting period an effect in patients above 65 years of age was shown in line with the 
effect seen in younger adults, however, no effect was seen in patients ≥75 years. 
Discussion on benefits 
Based on an assessment of the main results of 13 new clinical studies enrolling approximately 5000 
patients with major depressive disorder, the overall efficacy of agomelatine based on short- and 
long-term outcomes on the HAM-D scale was considered modest, but generally in line with findings 
from previously submitted and assessed studies that formed the basis for the EU approval in 2009. 
In some of the newly performed studies, treatment with agomelatine was not superior to placebo 
and/or an active control (SSRI/SRNI). Differences on the HAM-D scale were, however, rather small 
and the clinical relevance of these findings could be questioned. 
4.  Benefit-risk balance 
The clinical efficacy on major depression was considered modest, however agomelatine has 
characteristics distinct from other antidepressants that may be valuable for a subset of patients, 
such as a positive effect on sleeping disturbances, a prominent symptom of major depression. 
Among the risks identified with agomelatine, hepatotoxicity was considered to be the most 
important. This caused concern, but it was decided that the risk might be acceptable provided that 
the recommendations in the SmPC were strictly followed. The overall benefit-risk balance of 
agomelatine in the treatment of patients with MDD remained positive. 
5.  Comments from Member States 
General comments: 
The severity of the cases of hepatotoxicity in the context of additional risk factors were worrying 
and further risk minimisation measures should be implemented (see below). 
In term of efficacy, the new US placebo controlled efficacy studies should be assessed by the CHMP 
(the comparative studies with active arm without placebo arm were not considered 
methodologically adequate, to allow the assessment of the benefit of agomelatine as assay 
sensitivity was not ensured). 
Hepatotoxicity 
It was agreed that hepatotoxicity remained the main safety concern for agomelatine. Four months 
after the dissemination of the DHPC and updated educational material, the risk minimisation 
measures did not seem to have any major impact on reducing the number of serious hepatotoxic 
reactions or improving compliance with the SmPC, as supported by the PSUR data. The 
effectiveness of these measures should be further investigated through the prescription survey 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 60/73 
 
 
 
performed by the MAH (study report submission in December 2013). However, there were doubts 
about the additional value of the prescription survey on this issue. 
For  that  reason  the  following  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  and  updates  of  the  SmPC 
were proposed: 
  The  monitoring  of  liver  function  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  should  be  included  in  bold 
type  within  a  black  box  according  to  the  Guideline on  Summary  of  product  characteristics 
(September 2009, rev. 2) in order to attract the prescriber’s attention on this risk and the 
importance to perform monitoring of liver function.  
 An elevation of transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of the normal range should be 
reinforced as a contraindication. 
 An abdominal ultrasound should be recommended at initiation of Valdoxan. 
  It  should  be  stated  in  section  4.8  that  few  cases  of  hepatic  failure  were  reported  with 
fatal outcome or liver transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors. 
  The  treatment  should  be  initiated  and  supervised  by  a  physician  experienced  in 
depression as an additional risk minimisation measure. 
Rationale:  
During the covered period, 2 fatal cases of hepatic failure were reported in the context of alcohol 
consumption. The role of agomelatine as having an additive deleterious hepatic effect in patients 
with substantial alcohol intake is likely. No information on monitoring of liver function at Valdoxan 
initiation was provided for these 2 cases. 
After the data lock-point, an additional case of acute hepatic failure was reported. The patient 
consumed alcohol for several years and experienced acute hepatic failure 30 days after Valdoxan 
initiation (bilirubin: 165mg/L, ALP: 152UI/L, GGT: 200UI/L, AST: 1739UI/L, ALT: 665UI/L, Factor V: 
47%) that required Valdoxan discontinuation. No information on monitoring of liver function is 
provided. The patient had not recovered at the time of reporting. 
Caution was recommended when prescribing Valdoxan for patients with hepatic injury risk factors 
as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (section 4.4). As the monitoring of liver function detailed in the 
SmPC does not allow diagnosis of steatosis, an abdominal ultrasound should be recommended at 
initiation of Valdoxan.  
Considering preliminary data from the prospective observational study (CLE-20098-068), the 
recommendations in the SmPC did not seem to be systematically strictly adhered to (i.e initiation 
of Valdoxan in patients with an increase in transaminases exceeding 3X upper limit of normal at 
baseline). Therefore, an elevation of transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of the normal range 
should be reinforced as a contraindication. 
The treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in depression in order 
to ensure an optimal benefit / risk assessment on an individual basis.

Elderly patients 
The clinical study CL3.070 concluded to a modest clinical relevance of agomelatine in patients 65 
years and older; however it was in line with the effect observed for agomelatine in other clinical 
studies in younger adults. On the contrary, no effect was documented for the small sub-group of 
patients ≥ 75 years. The CHMP concluded that agomelatine should not be used by patients in this 
age group which is stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In order to attract the prescribers’ attention 
on this recommendation for this vulnerable population, it should also appear in the section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
An analysis of suicidal events in elderly patients (> 65 years)  and a cumulative review of post-
marketing cases reported in patients 65 years and older (≥ 75 years) since Valdoxan market was 
recommended to be performed.  
Regarding that no effect was documented for the sub-group of patients ≥ 75 years and the higher 
vulnerability of this population, Valdoxan use in elderly patients should continue to be closely 
monitored and a new study in this population should be performed. Without this commitment, a 
contradiction in patients ≥ 75 years should be discussed. 
Hyponatremia 
Evidence was presented indicating a causal relationship between agomelatine and event of 
hyponatremia. Hyponatremia should be listed in the section 4.8 as post-marketing event provided 
that this signal is confirmed further to analysis of narrative cases. A warning concerning this 
adverse reaction should also be added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
PRAC position: 
Introduction of black box: 
In accordance with the SmPC Guideline, especially important safety information may be included in 
bold type within a box in exceptional cases. This is a measure rarely used in EU SmPCs. The 
warning regarding hepatotoxicity already has a central placement at the top of section 4.4 in the 
Valdoxan SmPC. Additionally, the risk of hepatotoxicity has also been clearly communicated 
through Dear Healthcare Professional Communication and Educational Materials. The additional 
benefit of introducing a “black box” is therefore considered to be marginal, and it could be 
questioned if the requirements for “exceptional cases” are fulfilled, in accordance with the SmPC 
guideline. Overall, the PRAC did not support the proposal to introduce a black box. 
Introduction of elevated transaminases > 3 ULN as a contraindication: 
In the SmPC it is stated that therapy should be discontinued if serum transaminases exceeds 3 X 
upper limit of normal. Regarding initiation of treatment, it is recommended to exercise caution 
when administering agomelatine to patients with pretreatment elevated transaminases (> the 
upper limit of normal ranges and ≤ 3 times upper limit of the normal range). Although these 
recommendations should be interpreted to not initiate treatment in patients with transaminases > 
3 ULN, this is not explicitly stated in the SmPC. The addition of the proposed contraindication would 
therefore serve as a clarification of the current recommendations, and the proposal is therefore 
supported by the PRAC. 
Recommendation to perform abdominal ultrasound: 
The PRAC did not consider that it was warranted to introduce a recommendation to perform 
abdominal ultrasound in all patients prior to initiation of treatment. The SmPC includes a warning 
to exercise caution when prescribing agomelatine for patients with hepatic risk factors e.g. 
obesity/overweight/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, substantial alcohol intake or concomitant 
medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury. The decision to perform any further 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 62/73 
 
 
 
investigations such as abdominal ultrasound to elucidate potential hepatic risk factors should be 
left to the decision of the treating physician based on an overall evaluation of each individual 
patient. It was not considered appropriate to introduce a general recommendation for abdominal 
ultrasound in all patients, and it was considered that such a measure would be difficult to carry out 
in practice.  
Update of section 4.8 
The proposal to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with information of cases of fatal outcome or liver 
transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors was supported. It was also considered that the 
same text should also be included in section 4.4. 
Initiation of treatment by physician experienced in the treatment of depression: 
Psychiatrists are best qualified in treating depression, however they are not in general expected to 
have any particular expertise in the monitoring and treatment of hepatotoxic reactions.  Depression 
is also a frequent diagnose among patients treated by general practitioners, who are considered as 
well qualified for monitoring hepatic function as psychiatrists. The PRAC did not consider that the 
above proposal would be an efficient risk minimisation measure, and therefore did not support it.  
The PRAC supported the proposal that information should be included in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
on the fact that agomelatine should not be used in patients ≥ 75 years of age.  It was agreed that 
the use of agomelatine in this population, should be closely monitored in the following PSUR-
period.  
Study CL3.070 only included 48 patients receiving agomelatine. As antidepressant agents in 
general are frequently used in elderly patientsthe PRAC recommended reiterating the message to 
the prescribers with regards to the lack of efficacy in patients ≥ 75 years of age and risk of 
hepatotoxicity. 
Concerning suicidality in elderly: 
Suicidality is addressed in the SmPC. Section 4.4. contains the standard text on suicidality that is 
included in SmPCs of all antidepressants on the market. “Suicidal thoughts or behavior” is stated 
as an ADR in section 4.8. The MAH was requested to present in the following PSUR, data on 
frequency of suicidal events in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) compared with frequency in younger 
age groups. The PRAC did not consider that a cumulative review of post-marketing suicidal events 
in elderly patients would provide additional information. However, if the frequency of suicidal 
events in elderly patients, based on data from pooled clinical trials, turned out to be higher than in 
lower age groups, further activities may be warranted. 
The proposal regarding hyponatraemia was endorsed. 
6.  MAH’s responses and comments to the preliminary 
assessment report: 
6.1.  Request for supplementary information 
There is some evidence that agomelatine can induce hyponatraemia. However, to 
elucidate this in more detail, the MAH is asked to submit narratives of all cases 
previously not submitted. 
The MAH has submitted case narratives for all cases of hyponatraemia previously not submitted 
(20 cases).

In total 33 cases of hyponatraemia were reported to the MAH.  
PRAC comments: 
The additional cases did not provide further evidence on the association of agomelatine with 
hyponatraemia. Alternative explanations were present in most cases, like concomitant drugs 
and/or vulnerability of the patient to hyponatraemia. In other cases sufficient information was 
lacking to assess causality (i.e. information on time relationship and/or outcome). 
Hyponatraemia is labeled for most of the other classes of antidepressant drugs like tricyclics, 
SSRI, SNRI and mirtazapine.  However, agomelatine has a different mechanism of action than 
these drug classes (melatonin-agonist (MT1-and MT2) as well as a 5-HT2c-antagonist). 
The PRAC considered that evidence was not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between 
agomelatine and hyponatraemia. 
In future PSURs, the MAH was requested to present narratives of all new cases of hyponatraemia. 
Special attention should be paid to cases with positive rechallenge, positive dechallenge and cases 
recovering during continuous treatment. Efforts should be taken to collect all relevant information 
to assess causality for these cases. 
Based on the review of data on safety and efficacy, the PRAC considered that the risk-benefit 
balance of medicinal products containing the active substance agomelatine remained favorable, but 
recommended that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) be varied as described: 
-  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add restless leg syndrome with a frequency 
≥ 1/1000 – 1/100 
-  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add tinnitus with a frequency ≥ 1/100 to 
<1/1 
-  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add convulsions with a frequency ≥1/10 000 
to <1/1000 
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
MAH’S RESPONSE: 
6.1.1.  Restless leg syndrome 
The MAH agreed to update section 4.8 with restless leg syndrome (frequency  ≥ 1/1000 to < 
1/100). 
6.1.2.  Tinnitus 
The MAH consented to update section 4.8 with tinnitus. However, they argued that the frequency 
should be ≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100, and this was endorsed by the PRAC.

6.2.  Convulsions 
Further to PSUR 6 PRAC preliminary assessment report on 8th July 2013, MAH was requested to 
include Convulsion in section 4.8 of Valdoxan SmPC as rare adverse reaction. 
In view of the update of data from post-marketing as well as further explanation regarding 
preclinical and clinical data, the MAH still considered convulsion as a false signal and proposed not 
to incorporate this event in section 4.8 of Valdoxan SmPC 
Preclinical data used to support the MAH position 
Several preclinical studies have shown the anticonvulsant properties of melatonin in different 
rodent models (mice, rat, guinea pigs) of epilepsy. In the amygdala kindled rats (established model 
for temporal lobe human epilepsy), melatonin (75mg/kg, i.p. acutely) increased the after-discharge 
threshold and suppressed generalized seizures (Mevissen et al., 1998). In models of epilepsy 
induced by drugs (pilocarpine, penicillin, pentetrazole, kainate) or electroshock, melatonin (10-
80mg/kg i.p. or 40-80μg i.c.v. acute or chronic treatment) increased the latency and decreased the 
frequency of convulsions in rats (Costa-Lotufo et al.,2002; Yildirim and Marangoz, 2006; 
Tchekalarova et al., 2013) and guinea pigs (Solmaz et al., 2009), and increased the seizure 
threshold in mice (Borowicz et al., 1999; Yahyavi-Firouz-Abadi et al., 2006). Moreover the selective 
melatonin receptor ramelteon ( 200mg/kg 5 days) attenuated seizure periodicity and frequency in 
the mice lacking the potassium channel subunit KCNA1 chronic epilepsy model (Feneglio-Simeone 
et al, 2009). In clinics, several data from clinical studies and case reports are in line with a 
beneficial effect of melatonin in epileptic patients. Indeed, chronic melatonin (3-50mg) reduced the 
seizure frequency, an effect mainly in children and adolescents (Molina-Carballo et al., 1997; 
Fauteck et al., 1999; Peled et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2005; Uberos et al., 2011, Goldberg-Stern et 
al.,2012). Preclinical safety pharmacology studies have shown that agomelatine had a protective 
effect against electroshock-induced convulsions in mice (32 and 128 mg/kg NP08127). In rats 
agomelatine (64 and 128 mg/kg) increased the ECS threshold (NP15704). In line with these data 
the anticonvulsivant effects of agomelatine (25-75 mg/kg i.p. acutely) on pentylenetetrazole and 
pilocarpine-induced convulsions by increasing convulsions latency has been described (Aguiar et al, 
2012). 
Globally, the data from preclinical studies were in favor of the anticonvulsant effects of melatonin 
agonists and specially agomelatine. Furthermore, melatonin was shown to have anticonvulsant 
effects in epileptic patients. 
PRAC comments: 
Safety pharmacology studies with agomelatine and melatonin have demonstrated increased 
electroconvulsive threshold in mice and rats, indicating lack of a pro-convulsive effect of 
agomelatine. Further, no seizures were reported in general toxicity studies with agomelatine in 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 65/73 
 
 
 
 
rats and monkeys. In line with these findings, the MAH provided literature references, all 
indicating anti-convulsive effects of melatonin-receptor activation in different animal models.   
In conclusion, existing non-clinical data did not indicate a pro-convulsive effect of agomelatine.  
Although preclinical data are not necessarily relevant for humans, these data provided an element 
of uncertainty to the recommendation that section 4.8 of the SmPC should be updated with 
“convulsions”.  
As regards melatonin an article in the journal «Drug Safety» concluded that there was clearly a 
need for large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to establish the role of 
melatonin in either predisposing to or decreasing the likelihood of seizures. However, the limited 
human data and considerable animal work suggest that melatonin was unlikely to cause significant 
seizure exacerbations and, perhaps in higher doses, might have antiepileptic properties.  
(Siddharth Jain, Besag FMC. Does Melatonin Affect Epileptic Seizures? Drug Saf 2013; 36:207-215). 
Phase II and III Clinical data to support the MAH position 
The Integrated Analysis of Safety was performed on data from forty six (46) completed clinical 
studies. The Overall safety set (OSS), includes data from all Phase II and Phase III studies of 
patients with MDD or with one of the different diseases studied in the agomelatine development 
program (e.g. elderly patients with primary insomnia or with Alzheimer's disease, patients with 
delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients with schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder…). It 
consists in 9364 patients who received agomelatine (8410 patients received agomelatine 25/50 
mg), 1851 received placebo and 2604 received an active control (fluoxetine, paroxetine, 
venlafaxine, escitalopram, sertraline or duloxetine). 
Five cases of Seizures on agomelatine (dose 25/50 mg) out of 8410 agomelatine-treated patients 
(0.06%) were reported as an adverse event during phase II and III development program. 
Among those 5 cases, the following PT terms were recorded: 2 cases of Convulsion, 2 cases of 
Epilepsy and 1 case of Grand mal convulsion. 
Among 5 patients, 2 had a medical history of epilepsy. The event was serious in both cases. One 
other patient had a medical history of syncope, a familial history of epilepsy and the urine THC 
(TetraHydroCannibinol) test was positive while seizures occurred (concomitant use of cannabinoids). 
In two remaining patients, the event occurred 366 days after the first intake of the study drug in 
the first case and 365 days after the study beginning (and one day after the last study drug intake) 
in the second one. In this last patient, the seizures occurred in the context of venipuncture (3 
attempts). 
In conclusion, no particular concern rose from the analysis of these 5 cases. 
PRAC conclusion: 
It was agreed that causality seemed doubtful for the two cases occurring one year after treatment 
initiation. For the other cases information was too scarce to assess causality. 
To assess causality in more detail, narratives for the cases seen in clinical studies were asked to 
be provided in the following PSUR. 
Post-marketing data 
Pr. 22 July 2013, 44 cases have been reported.

In 50% of the cases, dechallenge was positive, however, this concept is difficult to take into  
account when events occur as crisis that by nature is an event with a brief duration. Evolution was 
favourable in 85% of the cases with documented outcome. Five patients recovered under 
treatment. Amongst these 5 cases, follow up information was provided for 3 cases and no 
convulsive crisis reoccurred from 1 to 3 months after the initial event, although patient remained 
under Valdoxan. Eight patients amongst the 44 presented with neurological exploration such as 
Brain CT scan, MRI and/or EEG. 
No new safety concern arose from the post-marketing analysis of the cases of Convulsion and 
related terms. 
PRAC comments: 
It was agreed that cases with positive dechallenge were difficult to interpret. 
The case with positive rechallenge was previously discussed in this report. 
It should be noted that 5 patient had a favorable outcome while agomelatine was maintained at 
the same dosage. Narratives for these cases were asked to be provided in the PSUR to follow. 
Narratives should also be submitted for the 8 patients with neurological exploration. 
Overall the MAH considers that the data from preclinical studies were in favour of the 
anticonvulsant effects of melatonin agonists and specially agomelatine. Five cases of Seizures on 
agomelatine (dose 25/50 mg) out of 8410 agomelatine-treated patients (0.06%) were reported as 
an adverse event during phase II and III clinical trials. 
44 cases have been reported post-marketing. The review of data from post marketing surveillance 
showed that 73 % of the patients had a relevant context, medical history or concomitant 
medication that could explain convulsions.  
All cases presented with imputability assessed as doubtful except 1 case, assessed as likely 
because of positive rechallenge, in a patient with untreated well known medical history of epilepsy, 
which was poorly documented. The MAH considered that this case did not raise any safety concerns. 
In 50% of the cases dechallenge was positive, however, this concept is difficult to take into account 
when events occur as crisis that by nature is an event with a brief duration. 
In accordance, the signal “Convulsion” remains a false signal and the MAH argued that it was not 
relevant to update the SmPC and leaflet accordingly.

PRAC comments: 
Preclinical data did not indicate a pro-convulsive effect of agomelatine. Safety pharmacology 
studies with agomelatine and melatonin demonstrated increased electroconvulsive threshold in 
mice and rats. 
An article published in the journal “Drug Safety” concluded that there was limited human data and 
considerable animal work suggesting that melatonin was unlikely to cause  significant seizure 
exacerbations and, perhaps in higher doses, might have antiepileptic properties. However, large 
randomized double blind and placebo-controlled trials were recommended as needed to assess the 
role of melatonin as regards effect on convulsions. 
As previously discussed, human data on the possible association between agomelatine and 
convulsions remained difficult to interpret. 
Based on the totality of preclinical and clinical data, the PRAC endorsed the opinion that it was too 
premature to include “convulsion” as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SPC. The MAH was requested to 
submit narratives of all cases of convulsions reported in the PSUR (7) period to follow, where the 
causality between agomelatine and convulsions could be re-evaluated.  
6.3.  Study CL3-20098-073:  
The MAH should consider whether treatment recommendations when therapy is switched 
from another antidepressant therapy (SSRI or SNRI), can be derived from this study. If 
so, treatment recommendations should be included in the SmPC as this is clinical 
important information for the prescriber. 
RESPONSE 
In view of the above mentioned assessment’s comment the MAH proposes to submit a variation 
within 2 months after the end of the renewal procedure and PSUR assessment procedure in order 
to reflect in the SmPC treatment recommendations when therapy is switched from another 
antidepressant therapy (SSRI or SNRI) derived from the CL3-20098-073. 
PRAC comments: 
The above proposal was supported. 
7.  Literature 
The PRAC-Rapporteur has recently been made aware of a publication describing two cases of 
delirium associated with agomelatine*. Positive rechallenge was noted in both cases.  
At DLP of PSUR 6, there were 9 cases of delirium and 2 cases of delirium tremens in the MAH’s 
database. There were 56 cases of “confusional state”. In addition, the following ADRs are stated in 
section 4.8 of the SPC: agitation, irritation, aggression and hallucinations. 
The authors discuss that delirium may possibly involve the melatonin-receptors MT1 and MT2, as 
hallucinations, amnesia, agitation and behavioral changes have been reported for the selective 
MT1/MT2-agonist ramelteon. 
In the next PSUR the MAH was asked to perform a cumulative review of cases of delirium and 
discuss whether delirium should be stated as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SPC.

8.  Final assessment conclusions and actions  
Data from PSUR no 6 did not change the benefit-risk profile of the product.  
Based on an assessment of the main results of 13 new clinical studies, enrolling approximately 
5000 patients with major depressive disorder, the overall efficacy of agomelatine based on 
outcomes on the HAM-D scale was considered modest, but generally in line with findings from 
previously assessed studies that formed the basis for the EU approval in 2009.  
Hepatotoxicity remained the main safety concern. Data from this PSUR confirmed previous 
knowledge in this area. To clarify the recommendations in the SmPC, the PRAC considered that 
section 4.3 of the SmPC should be updated to include a contraindication in patients with 
transaminases exceeding 3 X upper limit of normal. Further to this, section 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC should be updated to include information on cases of hepatic failure reported with fatal 
outcome or liver transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors. Otherwise, the risk 
minimisation measures were considered to be sufficient. The MAH was in the process of performing 
a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of these risk minimisation measures, the results of which 
were to be discussed in the following PSUR.  
Skin reactions and suicide were still considered to be important potential risks of the product. 
Restless leg syndrome, Tinnitus:  
Restless leg syndrome and tinnitus were to be included as adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC with a frequency “uncommon”. The package leaflet was to be updated accordingly. 
Convulsions 
Forty-four (44) cases were reported in the post-marketing period. About one-third of the cases 
occurred within a week after start of treatment, suggesting a time-relationship. Positive 
rechallenge was seen in one case, and positive dechallenge in 22 cases. The value of dechallenge 
in this context was, however, difficult to interpret as the event was of short duration. Clinical trial 
data showed no significant difference in the incidence of convulsions between agomelatine and 
placebo. However, data indicated a trend that the incidence was higher in the agomelatine-group 
(0,06%) vs placebo-group (0%). 
Preclinical data demonstrated an increased electroconvulsive threshold of agomelatine and 
melatonin in mice and rats. A leading article in the journal “Drug Safety” concluded that based on 
preclinical and limited human data, melatonin was unlikely to cause significant seizure 
exacerbations and might even have antiepileptic activity in higher doses.  
Based on the totality of data, the PRAC was of the opinion that it was too premature to include 
“convulsions” in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  The causality between agomelatine and convulsions was 
to be re-evaluated following the next PSUR-period. 
Hyponatraemia 
Thirty-three (33) cases of hyponatraemia were reported.  Positive rechallenge was seen in three 
cases, while positive dechallenge was seen in nine cases. Clinical trial data showed no significant 
difference in the incidence of hyponatraemia between agomelatine (0,06%) and placebo (0%), 
however, a trend indicating a higher incidence in the agomelatine-group could be seen. 
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 71/73 
 
 
 
There was evidence indicating that agomelatine could induce hyponatraemia. However, data were 
too scarce to establish a causal relationship. The causality was to be re-evaluated following the 
next PSUR-period.  
Events under close monitoring 
Pancreatitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, drug interactions with anticoagulants as well as use of 
agomelatine in patients ≥ 75 years, were recommended to remain under close monitoring in the 
following PSUR period.  
The following events were decided not to be under close monitoring any longer: confusion, blood 
bilirubin increased, myalgia, blood pressure increased, alopecia, palpitations, oedema peripheral, 
panic attacks, muscle spasm, tremor and photosensitivity. 
PSUR for the next period 
The PSUR should be submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The PRAC noted the MAH’s commitment to submit a variation within 2 months after the end of the 
renewal procedure and PSUR assessment procedure in order to reflect in the SmPC treatment 
recommendations when therapy is switched from another antidepressant therapy (SSRI or SNRI) 
derived from the CL3-20098-073 study. 
9.  Request for supplementary information 
In the next PSUR the MAH was asked to submit narratives for all the cases of hyponatraemia 
reported. Additionally they should submit narratives for: 
- 
the 5 cases of convulsions reported with favourable outcome while agomelatine was 
maintained at the same dosage.  
the 8 cases with neurological exploration.  
cases of convulsions seen in clinical studies  
cases of convulsions reported in the next PSUR-period 
- 
- 
- 
10.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of data on safety and efficacy, the PRAC considered that the risk-benefit 
balance of medicinal products containing the active substance agomelatine remained favourable 
but recommended that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) be varied as follows: 
  Update of section 4.2 to state that agomelatine should not be used in patients ≥ 75 years. 
  Update of section 4.3 of the SmPC to add transaminases exceeding 3X upper limit of 
normal as a contraindication. 
  Update section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC with information about cases of hepatic failure 
reported with fatal outcome or liver transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors. 
  Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add restless leg syndrome with a frequency ≥ 1/1000 
– 1/100.  
  Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add tinnitus with a frequency ≥ 1/1000 to <1/100 
 
The Package leaflet is to be updated accordingly.   
Valdoxan/Thymanax  
EMA/702809/2013 
Page 72/73 
 
 
 
Moreover, the PRAC recommended that a DHPC should be submitted to remind the prescribers on 
efforts to be taken to avoid serious hepatic ADRs. In addition, prescribers should be reminded that 
efficacy has not been shown in patients > 75 years and that agomelatine should not be used in this 
population.  
The PRAC recommended that the PL should be amended with appropriate headings to attract the 
patient’s attention to the information about potential serious hepatic ADRs and how to avoid them. 
This message needs to remain consistent with the relative sections of the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH was requested to address the following issues in the next PSUR: 
  When analysing the effect of risk minimisation and compliance in future PSURs, the MAH 
should include analysis of whether liver function tests have been performed according to 
the SmPC. 
 
The MAH should present data on the frequency of suicidal events in elderly people (> 65 
years) and compare with frequencies in younger age groups. 
 
The MAH should perform a cumulative review of cases of delirium and discuss whether 
delirium should be stated as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SPC.  
 
The MAH should perform a cumulative review of new cases of convulsions and 
hyponatraemia. 
The following events should be under close monitoring in the next PSUR period:  
 
pancreatitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, drug interactions with anticoagulants and adverse 
events as well as lack of efficacy in elderly patients ≥ 75 years.

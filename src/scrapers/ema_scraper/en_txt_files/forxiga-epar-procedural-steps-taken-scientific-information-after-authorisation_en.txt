In addition, the Worksharing applicant took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in 
Edistride, Ebymect and Xigduo PI and to update the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflets 
the following dosage recommendation in case of renal 
impairment has been updated in section 4.2 and 4.4. 
Forxiga, Edistride: dapagliflozin should not be initiated in 
patients with a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 
mL/min and should be discontinued at GFR persistently 
below 45 mL/min. No dosage adjustment is required based 
on renal function. 
Xigduo, Ebymect: the maximum daily dose of metformin 
should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors 
that may increase the risk of lactic acidosis should be 
reviewed before considering initiation of metformin in 
patients with GFR < 60 mL/min. 
The results of study D1690C00024 (DERIVE) have been

and prolonged release exenatide (a GLP 1 receptor agonist) 
was compared to dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release 
exenatide alone in subjects with inadequate glycaemic 
control on metformin alone (HbA1c ≥ 8% and ≤ 12%). All 
treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to 
baseline. The combination treatment with dapagliflozin 10 
mg and prolonged release exenatide group showed superior 
reductions in HbA1c from baseline compared to 
dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release exenatide alone. 
Combination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged

release exenatide resulted in significantly greater 
reductions in fasting plasma glucose, in 2 hour post 
prandial glucose, in body weight and systolic blood 
pressure at week 28, as compared to either agent alone.  
These efficacy results were reflected in section 5.1 of the

glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) analogues had not been 
studied, was removed from section 4.4 as result of the

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC of Xigduo 
(dapaglifozin and metformin) and Forxiga 
(dapaglifozin) in order to reflect the long-term 
findings from  208 weeks (4 years) of administration 
of dapagliflozin as add-on-to metformin compared 
with a sulphonylurea (SU; i.e, glipizide) as add-on to 
metformin. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
reported in the clinical study report of study D1690C00004. 
Based on it the MAH has updated section 5.1 of the SmPC 
of Xigduo (dapaglifozin and metformin) and Forxiga 
(dapaglifozin) in order to reflect the long-term findings 
from 208 weeks of administration of dapagliflozin as add-
on-to metformin compared with a sulphonylurea (glipizide) 
as add-on to metformin. 
The study was designed to show non-inferiority for 
dapagliflozin versus glipizide at 52 weeks and the primary 
endpoint was met. At the end of the first extension period 
(LT1) some deterioration of HbA1c was observed, however, 
less prominent for dapagliflozin with a between treatment 
difference of  0.18 %. During the LT2 extension, HbA1c 
continued to rise but slower in the dapagliflozin treated 
Page 28/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
group than in the glipizide treated group, resulting in a 
between treatment difference of -0.30 % at 208 weeks. 
Overall about 20 % of patients completed the study without 
the need for rescue medication in both treatment groups 
(20 % vs 18 %, dapagliflozin and glipizide respectively) 
thus managed to maintain an acceptable metabolic control 
for four years with either dapagliflozin or glipizide. Due to 
the progressive nature of T2DM it is well known that 
treatment has to be intensified over time and maintaining 
effect over four years is considered clinically relevant albeit 
in a limited proportion of the patients. 
The data also show that the effect of both treatments on 
body weight, which had stabilised for both treatments at 52 
weeks, was maintained over the study duration resulting in 
a decrease in body weight (compared to baseline) of about 
-3.5 kg in the dapagliflozin treated group and a treatment 
difference of 4.38 kg at week 208. 
The safety data provided (up to 208 weeks treatment) 
confirm the safety profile known for dapagliflozin. The most 
common AEs are related to the increased excretion of 
urinary glucose, i.e. genital infections and UTI (urinary 
tract infections); there appears to be no increase in serious 
UTI over time compared to glipizide treatment.  
In conclusion, the data provided support the long-term use 
of dapagliflozin in the treatment of T2DM. The data 
supporting a maintained efficacy, both with regards to 
HbA1c and body weight, over the 208 week study period 
for a relevant proportion of patients is considered of 
relevance for the prescriber and the changes proposed to 
section 5.1 is therefore accepted.  
This application was submitted for a Type II variation,

on the safety and efficacy of Dapagliflozin reflecting the 
results of study D1693C00005, which evaluated 
dapagliflozin in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who had 
inadequate glycaemic control on a background treatment 
combination of metformin and sulfonylurea. 
The CHMP considered that the results from study 
D1693C00005 showed convincing efficacy results. A 
statistical significant placebo-corrected reduction in HbA1c 
of -0.62 was observed after 24 weeks which was 
considered a clinically relevant effect size. It can therefore 
be concluded that dapagliflozin is effective as add on to 
standard therapy to control glucose levels in type 2 
diabetes patients receiving metformin and a sulphonylurea 
in combination. An additional effect on body weight and 
blood pressure was shown as well.  
In addition no episodes of major hypoglycaemia were 
reported. No new safety concerns were identified by the 
CHMP. 
The CHMP considered that based on the submitted data it is 
appropriate to accept the proposed PI changes meant to 
reflect that the existing evidence supports the use of 
Forxiga in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea 
taken concomitantly.

The new clinical data are derived from a single clinical 
order to add information on the efficacy and safety of 
dapagliflozin as add-on to DPP-4 inhibitor 
(sitagliptin), with or without metformin. This 
variation is supported by data from Study 
D1690C00010. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
study (D1690C00010) that was stratified based on 
concomitant metformin use (sitagliptin monotherapy and 
sitagliptin + metformin). The primary efficacy evaluation 
was based on the first 24 weeks of treatment; maintenance 
of efficacy was also assessed as an exploratory objective at 
the 48-week time point. 
The placebo-corrected HbA1c reductions observed with 
dapagliflozin at Week 24 were maintained through Week 48 
overall and within each stratum. Mean HbA1c levels 
gradually increased over time in the placebo group, 
whereas they remained relatively stable or increased to a 
lesser extent in the dapagliflozin group (Figure 1), resulting 
in numerical improvements in placebo-corrected estimates 
between Weeks 24 and 48 (-0.46% and -0.68%, 
respectively), excluding rescue, repeated measures 
analysis. 
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reductions observed during 
week 24 and week 48 showed that the effect of 
dapagliflozin compared to placebo on FPG were maintained 
until week 48 overall and in both strata; this is reflected in

section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Postprandial glucose levels showed a mean decrease from 
baseline in the absolute 2-hour post liquid meal glucose 
level compared to placebo at week 24 and was maintained 
until week 48; this point has also been refelcted in section 
5.1 of the SmPC.  
Subjects with baseline seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
≥130 mmHg and a measurement of seated SBP at week 8, 
week 24, and week 48 did not show a mean change from 
baseline in seated SBP at either time point in the 
dapagliflozin group compared to placebo (-0.86 mmHg 
versus placebo). The results suggest that dapagliflozin had 
no meaningful effect on seated SBP compared to placebo in 
subjects with baseline seated SBP ≥130 mmHg at week 8 
and continued to show no effect on seated SBP until week 
48.  
Overall, subjects in the dapagliflozin group showed a mean 
decrease from baseline in total body weight compared to 
placebo of 2.03 kg at week 24 and of 2.22 kg at week 48. 
Referring to strata, the placebo-corrected mean decrease 
from baseline in total body weight was 1.86 kg at week 24 
and 2.23 kg at week 48 in stratum 1 as well as 2.04 kg at 
week 24 and 2.07 kg at week 48 in stratum 2. The results 
suggest that the effect of dapagliflozin compared to placebo 
on total body weight at week 24 was maintained until week 
48 overall and in both strata; this is reflected in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
The proportion of subjects achieving therapeutic glycaemic 
response defined as decrease in HbA1c of at least 0.7% 
from baseline was larger by 20.9% in the dapagliflozin than 
in the placebo group at week 48. The CHMP agreed that no 
conclusion on the maintenance of therapeutic glycaemic 
Page 32/35 
 
 
 
 
 
response could be drawn because the criterion for 
therapeutic glycaemic response was not evaluated at week 
24. At Week 48 when added to sitagliptin (with or without 
metformin), the adjusted mean change from baseline for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo was -0.30% and 0.38%, 
respectively. This has been reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
The results of the submitted data reflecting treatment with 
dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to DPP-4 Inhibitor 
sitagliptin, with or without metformin, over 48 weeks did 
not identify any new safety concerns. However, there were 
tendencies to higher incidences of hypovolemia and 
adverse events of renal impairment which emphasise the 
importance of the warnings and precautions included in the 
SmPC.

Based on the review of the submitted data and 
to: 
• Change in frequency figures in Section 4.8, in the 
sub-section on “Vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related 
genital infections” to achieve consistency within this 
section, and also across this section and the sub-
section on “Urinary tract infections” and to make the 
SmPC more clinically relevant for prescribers. 
• Correct the figures reported in Table 5, Section 5.1 
(Pharmacodynamic properties, under heading 
“Combination therapy”) due to a consistent 
programming error in late phase clinical studies with 
dapagliflozin. 
• Correct the data in Section 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic 
properties), in the sub-section on “Fasting plasma 
glucose” (under heading ”Glycaemic control”) in 
justifications which were generated by the MAH in order to 
correct the following: 
- two programming errors that affected only analyses of 
proportional efficacy endpoints  
- inconsistencies identified in the SmPC, Section 4.8 which 
affected the frequency figures mentioned for Vulvovaginitis, 
balanitis and related genital infections 
- an error associated with the omission of pioglitazone data 
from the SmPC affecting the figures mentioned in Section 
5.1, sub-section “Fasting plasma glucose” (under headings 
“Glycaemic control” and “Combination therapy”) 
- a correction of a rounding-off error which affected section 
5.1 of the SmPC, subsection “Patients with renal 
impairment” 
the CHMP concluded that the updated figures are

order to remove the data related to pioglitazone. 
• Correct a rounding-off error in Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC, in the sub-section on “Patients with renal 
impairment” 
introducing numerically small changes and do not impact 
the evaluation and prior conclusions on the reported clinical 
efficacy and safety results. 
Moreover, the CHMP considers that the proposed SmPC 
changes reflect in an appropriate manner the updated

updated the SmPC sections 4.8 in order to report the 
frequency of the major and minor hypoglycaemic events 
and 5.1 in order to indicate that effect is maintained 
compared to placebo and dapagliflozin appeares to be at 
least as effective as glipizide during the 52 weeks up to 104 
weeks study period following the initial 52 weeks study 
period reported previously. 
Concerning safety, in general, the identified risks were 
confirmed. Concerning potential risks, there were 
tendencies to higher incidences of hypovolaemia and AEs of 
renal impairment which are appropriately reflected through 
the already present SmPC warnings and precautions. 
In addition the reported figure for the body weight after 
short term treatment was corrected so that it does not 
include data after rescue treatment is given.

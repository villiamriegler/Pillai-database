Extension of indication for Bydureon to include the add-on use of exenatide in combination with 
dapagliflozin to patients whose diabetes is not adequately controlled with metformin based on the study 
D5553C00003 (Duration 8 study); section 4.1 of the SmPC is updated in order to align the indication 
wording with more recently approved glucose-lowering agents. Section 5.1 of the SmPC is also updated 
with the results of study D5553C00003 (Duration 8 study). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor editorial 
changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the updated RMP version 24 has been submitted. 
The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0130/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (P/0130/2016) was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

The purpose of this application is to provide information on the efficacy and safety of concomitant add-on 
treatment with exenatide and dapagliflozin as add-on to metformin, supporting addition of new study 
data to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), section 5.1. 
As the combination with SGLT2 inhibitors is not covered by the current wording of the indication, an 
update of SmPC section 4.1 has been proposed, and the MAH proposed at the same time to simplify the 
wording to be in line with more recently approved glucose-lowering agents including other glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). 
Exenatide once weekly 
Exenatide, a GLP-1RA, exerts its glycaemic-lowering effect by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin 
secretion, suppressing glucagon release, and delaying gastric emptying.  In addition, it lowers weight by 
inducing satiety through central mechanisms.  
Dapagliflozin  
Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2).  SGLT2 inhibition leads to 
pharmacologically controlled glucosuria, which leads to subsequent glycaemic effects, including lowering 
of FPG and PPG, and reductions in HbA1c and weight.  The glucosuria results in a mild osmotic diuresis 
which is associated with reductions in SBP. 
Rationale for combination therapy with exenatide and dapagliflozin 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 5/51 
 
  
  
 
 
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that is characterised by defects in multiple organ systems and 
usually requires combination therapy with agents that target different pathways.  Because physiological 
defects may be manifested differently in individual patients, and patients differ in their care needs due to 
differences in demographics, comorbidities, individual preferences and other factors, individualisation of 
diabetes management is emphasised in international guidelines as essential for successful diabetes care.  
The availability of various types and combinations of diabetes therapy is consistent with this emphasis on 
patient-centered care.   
The combination of exenatide and dapagliflozin is expected to have greater glucose-, weight- and blood 
pressure (BP)-lowering effects compared to the individual agents due to complimentary mechanisms of 
action (MOAs).  Dapagliflozin reduces plasma glucose in an insulin-independent fashion by causing 
excretion of urinary glucose, in contrast to the insulin-dependent mechanisms of glucose lowering with 
exenatide, including stimulation of insulin release and glucagon suppression.  The urinary loss of calories 
that leads to weight loss with dapagliflozin may be associated with a compensatory increase in food 
intake; this effect may be counteracted by the increase in satiety that occurs with exenatide.  In addition, 
the BP-lowering effects of dapagliflozin and exenatide are also likely due to at least partially differing 
mechanisms: dapagliflozin leads to osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, whereas the mechanism by which 
exenatide lowers SBP is unknown, potentially due to vasodilation and/or natriuresis.  Both agents act via 
glucose-dependent mechanisms and do not intrinsically increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.  
The clinical programme for this submission consists of a single Phase 3 study, Study D5553C00003.  The 
efficacy and safety data from the 28-week treatment period of this study support concomitant add-on 
treatment with the combination of EQW 2 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg od in patients with T2DM who have 
inadequate glycaemic control on metformin. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was performed because exenatide as a moderately sized naturally-
occuring peptide  is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment, in line with the current ERA 
guideline (CPMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP

2.3.2.  Main study 
A 28-week, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Phase 3 Study with a 
24-week Extension Phase Followed by a 52-week Extension Phase to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of Simultaneous Administration of Exenatide Once Weekly 2 mg and Dapagliflozin Once 
Daily 10 mg Compared to Exenatide Once Weekly 2 mg Alone and Dapagliflozin Once Daily 10 
mg Alone in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes who have Inadequate Glycaemic Control on 
Metformin 
Methods 
Study D5553C00003 was a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre, Phase III 
efficacy and safety study with a 24- and subsequent 52-week extension of simultaneous administration of 
EQW 2 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg QD compared to EQW 2 mg alone and dapagliflozin 10 mg QD alone 
in T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin.

Flow chart of study design 
EQW  Exenatide once weekly; HbA1c  Haemoglobin A1c  
The study consisted of a Screening Visit (Visit 1), a 1-week placebo Lead-in period, a Randomization Visit 
(Visit 3), and 9 further visits at 1- to 4-week intervals during a treatment period of 28 weeks. At the end 
of treatment, patients were to enter a 24-week extension period (Extension Period 1), with 3 further 
visits at 8-week intervals and a subsequent 52-week extension period (Extension Period 2) with 4 further 
visits at 13-week intervals. A follow-up visit was conducted 10 weeks after the last dose of study 
medication in Extension Period 2. 
Study participants 
The population selected for this study were patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on 
metformin, with a stable dose of metformin ≥1500 mg/day for at least 2 months prior to screening. The 
HbA1c inclusion criterion at randomisation (ie, 8.0% to 12.0%, inclusive) was selected to include patients 
with poor glycaemic control.  
The exclusion criterion at randomisation for creatinine clearance was <60 mL/min (1 mL/s) (calculated by 
Cockcroft-Gault formula) or a measured serum creatinine value of ≥133 µmol/L for male patients and 
≥124 µmol/L for female patients. These exclusion criteria are consistent with prescribing guidelines for 
metformin, dapagliflozin, and EQW. 
The purpose of the majority of the inclusion and exclusion criteria was to limit confounding factors that 
may complicate the interpretation of the study results (e.g., corticosteroid-induced T2DM, 
haemoglobinopathies that would interfere with the HbA1c analyses), or to exclude patients whose safety 
could be compromised by participation in the study. 
Treatments 
This was a double-blind, active-controlled study. The comparison of the combination of dapagliflozin and 
exenatide with its individual components is consistent with regulatory guidance regarding the 
investigation of combination products (CHMP 2009).

Background therapy 
Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy in both the United States (US) and the 
European Union (EU). 
Dapagliflozin 
The 10 mg dose was chosen for this study as it has been extensively studied in Phase III trials and has 
demonstrated a favourable benefit-risk profile. In addition, it is the most effective approved dose and 
therefore the most appropriate option for patients with very poor glycaemic control. 
Exenatide 
The 2 mg dose was used for this study as it is the dose that was studied in the Phase III program, and is 
the only approved dose of exenatide once weekly. EQW was provided as a kit containing 1 vial of 
exenatide powder for injection, 1 syringe with diluents, 2 vial adaptors, and 2 23-Gauge x 5/16 inch 
needles. i.e. as SDT. 
Rescue 
During 28-Week randomised treatment period, patients with inadequate glycaemic control based on 
progressively stricter glycaemic criteria (Table 1) remained in the study and received open-label rescue 
therapy with basal insulin while they continued receiving study medication. 
Table 1 Criteria for initiation of rescue therapy during the randomised 28-week 
treatment period 
Patients who meet the rescue criteria during the 28-Week treatment period had to complete Rescue visit 
procedures (equivalent to the Week 28 assessments) before receiving open-label rescue therapy. 
Rescued patients with central laboratory HbA1c values >8.0% despite a maximum tolerated dose of 
rescue therapy for 12 weeks were to be discontinued from the study and referred for additional anti-
hyperglycaemic therapy. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To compare the change from baseline in HbA1c at 28 weeks between exenatide once weekly (EQW) 2 mg 
and dapagliflozin 10 mg administered simultaneously compared to EQW 2 mg alone and dapagliflozin 10 
mg alone. 
Secondary objectives 
To compare the effect of EQW+dapagliflozin to EQW+placebo and/or to dapagliflozin+placebo, on 
changes in glycaemic control and anthropometric measures.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28. 
Secondary endpoints 
Glycaemic  
 
Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0%.  
  Change in FPG and 2-hour PPG after a standardised liquid meal tolerance test (MTT) from 
baseline to Week 28, and FPG from baseline to Week 2.  
Body weight 
  Change in total body weight from baseline to Week 28.  
 
Proportion of patients achieving weight loss ≥5.0%.  
Blood pressure 
  Change in SBP from baseline to Week 28.  
Sample size 
A total of 209 patients per treatment group were required assuming a mean difference of 0.35% in HbA1c 
change from baseline with EQW+dapagliflozin versus each monotherapy and a standard deviation of 
1.1% and 90% power (based on a 2-sample t-test at a 0.05 significance level). Assuming a 5% drop-out 
rate prior to Week 4 (Visit 6), the first visit where HbA1c was to be tested, 220 patients per treatment 
arm (a total of approximately 660 patients) would have post-baseline measurements of HbA1c and thus 
be included in the primary endpoint analysis. Assuming 40% screen failure, a total of 1100 patients were 
to be screened. 
Randomisation 
Patients who met all study requirements based on inclusion and exclusion criteria were centrally 
randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio at Visit 3 (Day 0) by the IVRS/IWRS to receive 1 of 3 treatments: 
EQW+dapagliflozin, EQW+placebo or dapagliflozin+placebo. Randomisation was stratified by baseline 
HbA1c (<9.0% or ≥9.0%). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Patients, the investigator, study site personnel, and Sponsor personnel 
involved with data review and analysis were blinded starting at Visit 3/randomisation. Masking of 
treatment assignment was achieved through the use of matching placebo injections and placebo tablets. 
The trial was on-going at the time of the analyses on data collected from the 28 weeks of treatment. The 
Sponsor and applicable representative(s) were unblinded in Extension Periods 1 and 2 i.e. from Week 28 
onwards. Sites and patients were to remain blinded during Extension Periods 1 and 2, until the study 
completion and final database lock.  
Statistical methods 
The Statistical Analysis Plan has not been amended and the current version (number 1.0) is dated 05 
February 2016. No changes were made to the planned analyses. 
The primary efficacy analysis assessed the benefit of the combination of EQW+dapagliflozin over the 
individual components for the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28. Superiority of the combination 
treatment group was to be concluded if and only if the comparisons of the combination treatment group 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 10/51 
 
  
  
against both control groups (EQW+placebo and dapagliflozin+placebo) were statistically significant.  
The primary efficacy analysis set was the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) based on all randomised patients who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline HbA1c assessment with 
patients analysed as randomised. 
The primary endpoint was analysed using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) that included 
treatment, region, baseline HbA1c stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0%), week (Weeks 4, 8, 12 6, 20, 24, and 28), 
and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects. Baseline HbA1c was included as a continuous 
covariate. If a patient’s last available measurement during the 28-week assessment period was from an 
unscheduled visit or Early Termination visit, it was mapped to the next closest scheduled visit and 
included in the MMRM analysis. No other missing data imputation was performed. Data collected after the 
initiation of the glycaemic rescue therapy or at the post-treatment follow-up visits after a premature 
treatment discontinuation, were excluded from the analysis.  
Data collected post rescue therapy and post discontinuation of study medication were included in two 
sensitivity analyses using the same MMRM model as that for the primary efficacy analysis. For the 
primary endpoint, supportive analyses were further performed using the same MMRM model as in the 
primary analysis but based on the PP analysis set and the Randomised analysis set (all patients who 
signed informed consent and were randomised). The Per-protocol (PP) set was a subset of the ITT set 
excluding subjects with important protocol violation(s). In addition, an ANCOVA examining the last 
available observation prior to receiving rescue therapy in ITT analysis set was conducted.   
Two additional methods of sensitivity analyses were performed to compare the results from a MAR-based 
(missing at random) analysis (MMRM) versus a MNAR–based analysis under several MNAR scenarios 
(missing not at random). The first using copy reference (CR) or Placebo-Based Multiple Imputation which 
assumes that values of patients from the experimental arm who discontinue treatment or initiate rescue 
therapy will subsequently follow a trajectory of outcomes in the control arm. The second was a Tipping 
Point Analysis to find a “tipping point” corresponding to a value of delta where the study conclusion of a 
significant treatment effect would no longer hold. 
For the secondary endpoints, the same MMRM model (as in the primary analysis) was used for continuous 
variables and a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test was used for categorical variables. A 
sequential gatekeeping procedure (Dmitrienko et al 2009) was applied to the primary and secondary 
endpoints in order to control the family-wise type I error rate. If superiority of the combination treatment 
group was established for the primary endpoint at 5% level of significance the set of 7 secondary 
endpoints were to be tested sequentially based on a pre-defined hierarchical order. 
In the analysis of proportion of patients with weight loss ≥5% and HbA1c <7.0% at Week 28 patients 
with missing data were treated as non-responders. Additional analyses were performed were missing 28-
week data was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).  
The trial was on-going at the time of the analyses conducted when all patients had completed 28 weeks 
of treatment. The analyses for the entire 52-week treatment period will be performed when all the 
patients completed the Extension Period 1. Similar analyses for the entire 104-week treatment period will 
be performed when all the patients completed the Extension Period 2.

EQW+placebo group, and 109 patients (46.8%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. 
The most frequently used new concomitant medications were paracetamol (6.5%), insulin glargine 
(4.6%), amoxicillin (4.0%), and ciprofloxacin (4.0%). Insulin glargine was the rescue medication used in 
this study. 
Use of rescue medication 
A total of 36 (5.2%) patients used rescue medication: 9 patients (3.9%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 
10 patients (4.3%) in the EQW+placebo group, and 17 patients (7.3%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo 
group. 
The most frequently used rescue medication was insulin glargine (29 patients; 4.2%). Open-label titrated 
basal insulin was the protocol-defined rescue medication. 
Numbers analysed

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 28  
The combination of EQW+dapagliflozin was superior to EQW alone or dapagliflozin alone in reducing 
HbA1c over 28 weeks. 
Mean HbA1c decreased from baseline to Week 28 for all treatment groups (Table 8). The LS mean change 
in HbA1c was -1.98% for the EQW+dapagliflozin group, -1.60% for the EQW+placebo group, and -1.39% 
for the dapagliflozin+placebo group. The difference in LS mean change between the EQW+dapagliflozin 
group and EQW+placebo group was -0.38% (p=0.004) and the difference in LS mean change between 
the EQW+dapagliflozin group and dapagliflozin+placebo group was -0.59% (p<0.001).

Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
The results for each of the supportive and sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary 
analysis. In comparing the analyses, the difference in estimated treatment differences was overall small, 
ranging from -0.34 to -0.38 for EQW+dapagliflozin vs EQW alone and from -0.51 to -0.59 for 
EQW+dapagliflozin vs dapagliflozin alone. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
As additional analyses, the primary efficacy variable, change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28, was 
analysed by the following baseline subgroup categories: age, sex, region, ethnic group, baseline BMI, 
baseline HbA1c, diabetes duration, race, and eGFR. 
At Week 28, a potential treatment by age subgroup interaction was observed (<65 vs ≥65, p=0.008). 
There were few patients in the ≥65 subgroup (21 to 29 per treatment group), which limits the 
interpretability of the interaction term for this subgroup analysis.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Glycaemic endpoints 
The EQW+dapagliflozin group had between 1.6 and 2.3 times as many patients who achieved HbA1c 
<7.0% at Week 28 compared with the EQW+placebo and dapagliflozin+placebo groups, respectively 
(Table 11).  The combination of EQW+dapagliflozin was also superior to EQW+placebo and 
dapagliflozin+placebo in reducing FPG at Weeks 2 and 28, and 2-hour PPG at Week 28 (Table 11). 
Body weight endpoints

The combination of EQW+dapagliflozin was superior to EQW+placebo and dapagliflozin+placebo in 
reducing mean body weight and the proportion achieving weight loss ≥5% at Week 28 (Table 11).  The 
effect on weight loss was additive in the EQW+dapagliflozin group compared to the individual therapies. 
Blood pressure 
The combination of EQW+dapagliflozin was superior to EQW alone and dapagliflozin alone in reducing 
systolic blood pressure over 28 weeks (Table 11).  The BP-lowering effect was at least additive for 
EQW+dapagliflozin compared to the individual therapies.

Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c ≤6.5% from baseline at Week 28 
The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c ≤6.5% at Week 28 was 30.3% in the EQW+dapagliflozin 
group, 18.5% in the EQW+placebo group, and 10.4% in the dapagliflozin+placebo group at Week 28 .  A 
greater proportion of patients achieved HbA1c ≤6.5% at Week 28 in the EQW+dapagliflozin group 
compared to the EQW+placebo group (p=0.003), and the dapagliflozin+placebo group (p<0.001).  All 
patients with missing data were treated as non-responders. 
Change in diastolic blood pressure from baseline at Week 28 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in the 3 treatment groups or statistical 
differences between treatment groups for DBP change from baseline to Week 28.  
Change in lipid profiles from baseline to Week 28 
There were no clinically relevant changes in cholesterol parameters (total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], or non-HDL cholesterol) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group 
or in the EQW+placebo group.  There were small increases in total cholesterol, LDL, and non-HDL 
cholesterol in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.  There was a clinically meaningful decrease in mean 
triglycerides in each of the 3 treatment groups EQW+dapagliflozin group (-0.31 mmol/L) compared to the 
EQW+placebo (-0.18 mmol/L) and dapagliflozin+placebo (-0.11 mmol/L) groups from baseline to 
Week 28. The nominal p-values for the differences between the EQW + dapagliflozin group and the 
dapagliflozin + placebo and EQW + placebo groups were 0.036 and 0.181, respectively.   
Exploratory pharmacokinetic endpoint 
Exenatide and dapagliflozin pharmacokinetic profiles 
The exenatide and dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics (PK) in the EQW + dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin + 
placebo, and EQW + placebo treatment groups were evaluated. No difference in exenatide exposure or 
dapagliflozin exposure across the EQW+dapagliflozin, EQW+placebo or dapagliflozin+placebo groups were 
seen. High inter-individual variability in data was observed. 
Long-term efficacy  
Study D5553C00003 efficacy data from the extension up to 52 weeks are summarised in the following. 
In total, 81% of the 695 randomised patients completed the 52-week treatment period and 75% of 
randomised patients completed treatment. The drop-out rate was highest in the EQW+placebo group 
(23%) and lower in the two other groups (16% in the EQW+dapa group and 17% in the dapa+placebo 
group).

Larger proportions of patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% in the EQW + dapagliflozin group compared to the 
EQW alone and dapagliflozin alone groups at Week 28 and Week 52. 
The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 52 was 33.8% in the EQW + dapagliflozin 
group, 24.2% in the EQW + placebo group (p=0.024 for the treatment comparison against EQW + 
dapagliflozin group), and 15.2% in the dapagliflozin + placebo group (p<0.001 for the treatment 
comparison against EQW + dapagliflozin group). The difference in proportion of patients who achieved 
HbA1c <7% between the EQW + dapagliflozin group and EQW + placebo group was 9.5% and between 
the EQW + dapagliflozin group and dapagliflozin + placebo group was 18.6%. 
All patients with missing endpoint data were treated as non-responders. 
Long-term efficacy up to 104 weeks will be available 2Q 2018.

Study D5553C00003 was a 28-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre, Phase 3b 
efficacy and safety study with a 24- and subsequent 52-week extension of simultaneous administration of 
EQW 2 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg od compared to EQW 2 mg + placebo and dapagliflozin 10 mg od + 
placebo in patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin. The total study 
duration will be 2 years; this submission presents data from the 28-week treatment period and the first 
extension period up to 52 weeks. 
The three-armed study designs allows for assessment of the contribution of each of the components in 
the combined therapy. 
The study included patients with T2DM treated with metformin only and with poor metabolic control as 
reflected by a HbA1c between 8% and 12%. This is adequate considering that two glucose lowering drugs 
were initiated at once. No restrictions regarding BMI were included in the criteria. The study duration is 
sufficient to allow assessment of the short-term effect on HbA1c. Long-term data up to 104 weeks will be 
available once the second extension period of the study have been finalised. 
The rationale for choosing the combination of a GLP1-RA (exenatide) and a SGLT2-inhibitor is based on 
the complementary MOAs of the two different drugs. The doses selected were based on the respective 
product information. The use of metformin as the background medication is supported by current 
guidelines. Criteria for starting rescue therapy (i.e. basal insulin) were in place. 
The statistical considerations regarding the study design are overall acceptable. The trial was on-going at 
the time of the analyses of the 28-week data; however, sites and patients were to remain blinded until 
study completion and final database lock (after extension period 2). Randomisation was 1:1:1 and 
stratified by baseline HbA1c (<9.0% or ≥9.0%). Efficacy data were to be continuously collected also 
during rescue therapy and post-treatment follow-up. The study was seemingly sufficiently powered and 
took into account the proportion of patients (assumed to be 5%) expected to be excluded from the 
primary Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis. The sample size calculation was based on a mean difference of 
0.35% in HbA1c change from baseline, EQW+dapagliflozin versus each monotherapy.  
Considering planned analyses no changes were made and the Statistical Analysis plan had not been 
amended. For the primary and the set of 7 secondary efficacy endpoints multiplicity was sufficiently 
handled through the use of a gatekeeping testing strategy. In addition (considering two pairwise 
comparisons) superiority of the combination treatment group was to be concluded if and only if the 
comparisons of the combination treatment group against both control groups (EQW+placebo and 
dapagliflozin+placebo) were statistically significant; hence no further multiplicity correction was needed. 
To be included in the ITT set a patient had to have been randomised, should have received at least one 
dose of study medication, and have at least one HbA1c post-baseline assessment. The first visit where 
HbA1c was to be evaluated was at Week 4 (Visit 6). The primary endpoint and continuous secondary 
endpoints were analysed using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) based on the assumption 
of data missing at random (MAR) i.e. that treatment response can be estimated without bias using 
exclusively observed data. In the analyses, data collected after initiation of rescue therapy and after 
treatment discontinuation were excluded. Several sensitivity and supportive analyses were planned and 
have been presented. Among them the primary analysis repeated based on the Randomised set and 
analyses using the primary MMRM model but taking data collected post rescue therapy and post 
discontinuation of study medication into account. Two sensitivity analyses were performed to address 
violations of the missing at random (MAR) assumption, one analysis using a Placebo-Based Multiple 
Imputation and a Tipping Point Analysis.

In general the study appears well conducted. Important protocol violations were relatively few (10 % of 
patients), evenly distributed between treatment groups and mainly related to compliance with treatment. 
In the EQW+dapagliflozin arm a total of 206/231 (89.2%) completed the 28 week treatment period. In 
the EQW monotherapy arm and in the dapagliflozin monotherapy arm it was 196/231 (84.8%) and 
209/233 (89.7%) respectively.  Of those who discontinued the study, the most common reasons were 
withdrawal by subject, lost to follow-up and adverse event.  
Overall, 14.7% (102/695) discontinued study treatment; 14.3% (33/231) of patients in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group, 18.6% (43/231) of patients in the EQW+placebo group, and 11.2% (26/233) 
of patients in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. 
It was few patients who used rescue, more in the in the dapagliflozin+placebo group however than in the 
other two arms. In the whole study population it was 36/695 (5.2%) whereof 9/231 (3.9%) in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group, 10/231 (4.3%) in the EQW+placebo group, and 17/233 (7.3%) in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo group. 
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm was excluded from the ITT analysis set; 3/231 
(1.3%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin arm, 4/231 (1.7%) in the EQW+placebo arm and 3/233 (1.3%) in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo arm. All patients but one in the EQW+placebo treatment group who did not receive 
treatment was excluded due to missing required efficacy assessment.  In the primary ITT analysis it was 
however 14.3% (98/685) of the patients who did not contribute with data and overall, this implied that 
15.5% (108/695) of those who had been randomised were excluded in the primary analysis.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary ITT analysis included 197/228 (86.4%), 192/227 (84.6%) and 198/230 (86.1%) patients in 
the EQW+dapagliflozin, EQW+placebo and dapagliflozin+placebo arm respectively. 
The study included subjects in general representative of poorly controlled T2DM patients. The population 
was, however, rather heterogeneous with e.g. BMI ranging from 19 to 65, HbA1c ranging from 6.6% to 
12.6%. The duration of diabetes was also very variable from 2 months up to 39 years.  
Inclusion was based on screening values. The MAH has clarified that only 5 of the 41 patients with 
baseline HbA1c <8.0% had an HbA1c below the lower limit for inclusion at screening.  With regards to 
renal function, different methods to assess renal function were applied at screening compared to the 
remaining part of the study. The difference between these methods explains the discrepancies observed 
in all but one of the 25 cases with eGFR below <60 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline.  Thus the number of 
patients actually violating inclusion criteria was low. 
At baseline, all patients but two were on a metformin dose of 1500 mg or more and the maximum dose 
used was 3000 mg.  No patients were using basal insulin at baseline. 
The difference in HbA1c mean change from baseline week 28 in the primary analysis was -0.38 (-0.63, -
0.13; p=0.003) for EQW+dapagliflozin vs EQW+placebo and -0.59 (-0.84, -0.34; p<0.001) for 
EQW+dapagliflozin vs dapagliflozin+placebo. 
Thus the contribution of exenatide to the effect of the combination was larger than that of dapagliflozin. 
However, both monotherapies contributed with a clinically relevant effect although the dapagliflozin effect 
is of somewhat borderline character.  
Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis supporting a conclusion 
of superiority in favour of the combined treatment of EQW and dapagliflozin over each monotherapy. In 
comparing the analyses, the difference in estimated treatment differences was overall small (the 
exception being the analysis based on the PP set; not presented here), ranging from -0.34 to -0.38 for 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 28/51 
 
  
  
EQW+dapagliflozin vs EQW alone and from -0.51 to -0.59 for EQW+dapagliflozin vs dapagliflozin alone 
implying that e.g. the exclusion of post rescue and post treatment discontinuation data had minor impact.  
However, most of the sensitivity analyses were based on the same MMRM model as used in the primary 
analysis and several was seemingly based on data from the same number of patients as in the primary 
analysis including the analysis on all randomised patients in which estimated outcomes was identical to 
the outcomes in the primary analysis. Although the number of patients excluded in the analyses was 
fairly well balanced between the treatment arms, this concerned approximately 15% of randomised 
patients. While both the analysis using a placebo-based multiple imputation and the Tipping Point analysis 
are appreciated as such, again MMRM was used and the same proportion of patients as in the primary 
analysis were excluded. None of the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint included all randomised 
patients and it may be that none was sufficiently conservative to challenge the primary analysis. In 
addition, the analyses of 4 (out of 5) continuous secondary endpoints were based on the same MMRM 
model as was used in the primary analysis resulting in the exclusion of data from similar proportions of 
patients as in the primary analysis. The MAH was asked to repeat analyses of the primary and continuous 
secondary endpoints based on a data set with better adherence to the ITT-principle (e.g. the currently 
defined (modified) ITT for which the exclusion of approximately 1.4% of randomised patients can be 
accepted). The MAH clarified that analyses involved all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose 
of study medication and had at least 1 on-treatment measurement and that no patient from this study 
population was excluded from any of the efficacy analysis. The only new analyses provided in response to 
this request were analyses of secondary endpoints including post-rescue/post study medication 
discontinuation data. The results taking these data into account were consistent with the results of 
analyses excluding these data. For SBP this was the primary analysis approach (and hence, the “new” 
analysis provided was the same as the one already presented in e.g. the CSR). Sensitivity analyses of the 
primary endpoint were requested to be performed based on all randomised patients using a conservative 
imputation approach in case data was missing. In at least one analysis patients with missing endpoint 
data, patients in need of rescue therapy and patients who discontinued the study and/or study treatment 
should be handled as treatment failures (using baseline observation carried forward). Additional 
sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint (Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28) using ANCOVA 
(BOCF) have now been provided. Although not based on all randomised but ITT; this is not further 
pursued considering the minor difference and the statistically convincing outcomes. Irrespective of 
analysis, differences between the treatments were (still) statistically convincing with outcomes appearing 
to be robust; for the comparison of EQW+Dapa versus EWQ+placebo; estimates were very similar 
compared to the outcome in the primary analysis. For EQW+Dapa versus Dapa+Placebo the difference 
between the treatments was slightly smaller (point estimate of e.g. -0.45) compared to the outcome in 
the primary analysis (point estimate -0.59). For the above sensitivity analyses it was (as requested) 
clarified in how many cases endpoint data were available at week 28, and in how many cases endpoint 
data were missing and imputation used.  
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint. There was a statistically significant 
interaction with age. Older subjects (≥65 years) showed an overall greater effect of the combination than 
younger patients (<65 years) (-2.39% vs -1.91%). The treatment effect of both monotherapies was 
numerically lower in the older age group, the difference between age groups being most pronounced for 
dapagliflozin. The responder analysis by age group was in line with the analysis for change from baseline 
HbA1c. The lower effect of dapagliflozin in the older age group is in line with the data from previous 
studies with dapagliflozin, whereas no difference in effect by age has been observed with EQW. There is 
currently no apparent explanation to the higher than expected effect of the combination in the older 
patients. However, due to the low number of subjects, the data has to be interpreted with caution.  
The subgroup analysis by HbA1c showed that the effect of both the combination and the monotherapies 
was, as expected, most pronounced in patients with HbA1c ≥9%. The outcome of the primary analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 29/51 
 
  
  
was only preserved in patients with HbA1c 8-9%, thus the combination was superior to both 
monotherapies in this group.   
In the largest subgroup, i.e. patients with HbA1c ≥9%, the combination was only superior to 
monotherapy with dapagliflozin. 
In the subgroup with HbA1c <8%, which was the smallest subgroup, the combined treatment and 
monotherapy with dapagliflozin showed a comparable effect to that observed in patients with HbA1c 
8-9%, whereas a lower effect was observed in the EQW monotherapy group. Superiority of the 
combination was not shown for any of the monotherapies, the number of patients with HbA1c <8 was 
however low, thus the data should be interpreted with caution. 
In order to better understand the impact of baseline HbA1c on the outcome, a table with data on 
responders (HbA1c <7%) by baseline HbA1c (HbA1c <8%, HbA1c 8-9% and HbA1c ≥9%) was provided. 
Although the change in HbA1c is most pronounced in the subgroup with HbA1c > 9% at baseline, the 
responder rate in this subgroup is lower than in the subgroups with lower baseline HbA1c as may be 
expected. A similar pattern, with more responders with combination therapy and less for the single 
components, was observed for all three subgroups. 
The combination of EQW+dapagliflozin was superior to EQW alone and dapagliflozin alone for all 
secondary endpoints.  
The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 28 was 44.7% in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 
26.9% in the EQW+placebo group, and 19.1% in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. The difference 
between the EQW+dapagliflozin group and EQW+placebo group was 17.4% (p<0.001) and between the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group and dapagliflozin+placebo group was 25.6% (p<0.001). This analysis, based on  
the ITT set excluding only 1.4% of randomised patients treating all patients with missing endpoint data 
as non-responders, is considered to support a superior efficacy of EQW+dapagliflozin in reducing HbA1c.  
Body weight decreased by -3.6 kg in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, -1.6 kg in the EQW+placebo group, 
and -2.2 kg in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. Thus there was an additive effect on body weight by the 
combination. This was also reflected by a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving a body 
weight reduction of ≥5% in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (33%) compared to the EQW+placebo group 
(14%), and the dapagliflozin+placebo group (20%).  
An additive effect was also observed on SBP at Week 28. SBP decreased by -4.3 mmHg in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group, -1.2 mmHg in the EQW+placebo group, and -1.8 mmHg in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo group.  
Efficacy data up to 52 weeks has been provided. There was a slight increase in HbA1c of about 0.2% in 
all treatment groups between week 28 and week 52 but an adequate effect was maintained and the 
differences observed between treatment arms at week 28 were essentially maintained. The body weight 
remained essentially stable in all treatment groups between week 28 and 52 with only a slight increase. 
The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% decreased with about 10 % in the EQW+dapa group 
and about 5% in the monotherapy groups between week 28 and 52. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The combination of exenatide QW and dapagliflozin was superior to monotherapy with either exenatide or 
dapagliflozin on top of metformin in lowering HbA1c after 28 weeks. The effect was maintained up to 52 
weeks.

2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety and tolerability of exenatide and dapagliflozin as both single agent therapies and in 
combination with other therapies for T2DM, including metformin, were thoroughly documented and 
evaluated in the clinical development programmes for BYDUREON and FORXIGA. 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with EQW were mainly gastrointestinal related (nausea 
which was the most frequent reaction and associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over 
time, and diarrhoea). In addition, injection site reactions (pruritus, nodules, erythema), hypoglycaemia 
(with a sulphonylurea), and headache occurred. Most adverse reactions associated with prolonged-release 
exenatide were mild to moderate in intensity. The risk of hypoglycaemia is low and dependent on the 
background therapy used. 
Since immediate-release exenatide has been marketed, acute pancreatitis has been reported with a 
frequency not known and acute renal failure has been reported uncommonly. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction with dapagliflozin treatment was hypoglycaemia, which 
depended on the type of background therapy used in each study. In general the rate of minor 
hypoglycaemias was low (<5%). Other adverse reactions reported are related to the glucosuric effect of 
dapagliflozin such as events related to volume depletion and uro-genital infections. 
Patient exposure 
The mean duration of exenatide exposure was similar across the treatment groups in 
Study D5553C00003.  The mean duration of dapagliflozin exposure was similar across the treatment 
groups. 
The mean duration of exenatide/placebo exposure was 174.6 days in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 
175.0 days in the EQW+placebo group, and 183.0 days in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. 
The mean duration of dapagliflozin/placebo exposure was 180.2 days in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 
179.8 days in the EQW+placebo group, and 188.5 days in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. 
Adverse events  
AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by similar numbers of patients across the 
treatment groups (Table 13).  Adverse events related to study drug and AEs leading to discontinuation 
were higher in the EQW+dapagliflozin and EQW+placebo groups than in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.  
During the study, 5 subjects died.

All adverse events 
The SOCs with the greatest frequency of AEs (>5% in any treatment group) included: infections and 
infestations (EQW+dapagliflozin, 24.2%; EQW+placebo, 26.5%; dapagliflozin+placebo, 26.2%); GI 
disorders (15.6%; 15.2%; 11.6%; respectively); general disorders and administration site conditions 
(13.9%; 13.5%; 9.0%;); nervous system disorders (13.0%; 5.7%; 8.2%); skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (5.6%; 3.0%; 3.0%); investigations (4.8%; 9.6%; 7.7%); musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders (4.3%; 7.4%; 7.3%); and metabolism and nutrition disorders (3.5%; 5.2%; 4.3%). 
Headache, dizziness, dermatitis, and rash were more common in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (4.8%, 
3.5%, 1.3%, and 0.9%, respectively) compared to the EQW+placebo (3.5%, 0.4%, 0%, and 0.4%, 
respectively) and dapagliflozin+placebo groups (3.0%, 1.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).   
One patient in the EQW+placebo group had an AE of diabetic ketoacidosis.  The event was moderate in 
severity and considered unrelated to study drug. 
No malignancies were reported during the study other than skin neoplasms. 
Adverse events reported as related to study drug 
Adverse events reported as related to study drug as judged by the investigator were higher in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin (26%) and EQW+placebo (23%) groups than in the dapagliflozin+placebo (15.9%) 
group.     
The most common AEs related to study drug were injection site nodule (EQW+dapagliflozin, 7.8%; 
EQW+placebo, 5.7%; dapagliflozin+placebo, 4.7%), nausea (3.9%, 7.0%, and 1.3%, respectively), 
vomiting (0.4%, 3.5%, and 1.7%, respectively), diarrhoea (1.7%, 3.0%, and 0.4%, respectively), and 
injection site induration (1.7%; 2.6%; 0.9%, respectively).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
A total of 5 patients died during the study: 3 patients (1.3%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (PTs: 
multiple injuries, arteriosclerosis coronary artery, and toxicity to various agents), 1 patient (0.4%) in the 
EQW+placebo group (myocardial infarction), and 1 patient (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group 
(ischaemic stroke).  None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.   
Other serious adverse events 
The frequency and types of SAEs during the 28-week treatment period were low and similar across 
treatment groups: SAEs were reported by 10 patients (4.3%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 8 patients 
(3.5%) in the EQW+placebo group, and 10 patients (4.3%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.    
More SAEs were reported in the following SOCs for the EQW+dapagliflozin group compared to the 
dapagliflozin+placebo and EQW+placebo groups (>1% difference): GI disorders and hepatobiliary 
disorders. 
Anaphylactic reaction SAEs were reported for a total of 2 patients.  The event in the EQW+placebo group 
was severe in intensity, required hospitalisation, and was considered related to study drug.  The event in 
the dapagliflozin+placebo group was severe in intensity, required hospitalisation, and was considered not 
related to study drug.   
At the PT level, no SAE was reported by more than 1 patient per treatment group.

Adverse events of special interest 
Incidence of hypoglycaemia 
Major hypoglycaemia was an event that resulted in loss of consciousness, seizure or coma (or other 
mental status change consistent with neuroglycopenia), which resolved after administration of glucagon 
or glucose. In addition, any event that required third party assistance to resolve because of severe 
impairment in consciousness or behaviour and was associated with a plasma or capillary glucose 
concentration of <3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) was classified as major hypoglycaemia. 
Minor hypoglycaemia was a non-major hypoglycaemia event that had symptoms consistent with 
hypoglycaemia and had plasma or capillary glucose value of <3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) prior to treating the 
episode. 
There were no events of major or minor hypoglycaemia in the study.   
A total of 8 patients (3.5%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 3 patients (1.3%) in the EQW+placebo 
group, and 3 patients (1.3%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group had hypoglycaemia events which were 
classified as other (defined as not meeting criteria for major or minor hypoglycaemia).  Glucose values for 
these events ranged from 3.0 mmol/L to 4.2 mmol/L.  Most events were associated with symptoms, most 
events were considered mild, and there were no severe events.  
Other adverse events of special interest 
Adjudicated CV events 
There were few confirmed adjudicated CV events in the study, with no relevant differences in event 
numbers across treatment groups: a total of 1 patient in the EQW+dapagliflozin group and 2 patients 
each in the EQW+placebo and dapagliflozin+placebo groups had confirmed adjudicated CV events.   
Adjudicated hepatic events 
During the study, 2 events met criteria for hepatic adjudication.  One event was an SAE of hepatic 
enzyme increased in the EQW+placebo group that met biochemical Hy’s Law criteria.  The other event 
was elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.  Both events were 
adjudicated by a blinded hepatic adjudication committee and considered unlikely to be causally related to 
study drug.  
Volume depletion 
There were few potentially volume depletion-related events reported in this study: 2 patients (0.9%) in 
the EQW+dapagliflozin group (3 events in total, all of dehydration), no patients in the EQW+placebo 
group, and 3 patients (1.3%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group (2 events were of hypotension and one 
of syncope).  None of these events were SAEs or led to discontinuation, and all of these events resolved.    
Pancreatitis-related events 
During the study, 2 pancreatitis-related events were reported: 1 patient (0.4%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin 
group, 1 patient (0.4%) in the EQW+placebo group.  Neither of the events was an SAE.  Both events led 
to discontinuation and 1 event was considered related to study drug.  
Acute renal failure-related events 
Few acute renal failure-related events were reported in this study: no patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin 
group, 2 patients (0.9%) in the EQW+placebo group, and 1 patient (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo 
group.  None were SAEs, none led to study discontinuation, none of the events were considered related to 
study drug, and all events resolved.

Pancreatic carcinoma related- or thyroid neoplasm-related events 
No pancreatic carcinoma-related events or thyroid neoplasm-related events were reported during the 
study. 
Injection site-related events 
There were greater numbers of injection site-related AEs in the EQW+dapagliflozin (12.1%) and 
EQW+placebo (11.7%) groups than in the dapagliflozin+placebo (6.9%) group.  Most of these events 
were mild in intensity and considered related to study drug.   
Gastrointestinal-related events 
Gastrointestinal-related events were reported more commonly in the EQW+dapagliflozin (36 patients, 
15.6%) and EQW+placebo (35 patients, 15.2%) groups than in the dapagliflozin+placebo (27 patients, 
11.6%) group. Most GI-related events were mild or moderate in intensity.  The most commonly reported 
AEs were nausea and diarrhoea.  Four of GI-related events were reported as SAEs in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group; all 4 events had different PTs (abdominal pain lower, anal haemorrhage, 
gastrooesophageal reflux disease, and umbilical hernia). 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin+placebo groups showed an increase in mean 
haemoglobin and haematocrit from baseline to Week 28 (mean change from baseline to Week 28 in 
haemoglobin: EQW+dapagliflozin, 3.6 g/L; and dapagliflozin+placebo, 4.6 g/L; haematocrit: 
EQW+dapagliflozin 0.01, dapagliflozin+placebo 0.01).  In the EQW+placebo group, changes in mean 
haemoglobin and haematocrit during the 28-week treatment period were -1.5 g/L and -0.01, 
respectively.   
Clinical chemistry 
The mean eGFR was slightly decreased in all treatment groups, and to the smallest extent in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group.  At Week 28, the mean change from baseline was -0.59 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group, -0.39 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the EQW+placebo group, and -2.04 mL/min/1.73 m2 
in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.  
Individual marked laboratory abnormalities 
Creatinine elevations >1.5x higher than pre-treatment creatinine were reported for more patients in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group (14 patients; 6.1%) compared to the EQW+placebo (9 patients; 3.9%) and 
dapagliflozin+placebo groups (9 patients; 3.9%).  One patient in the EQW+dapagliflozin group had a 
creatinine elevation (≥221 μmol/L).  In the EQW+dapagliflozin group, all but 2 of the cases were one-
time elevations, and in 6 of 14 patients, the creatinine value remained within the normal range.  One of 
the creatinine elevations in the EQW+dapagliflozin group was reported as an AE and none were reported 
as SAEs. 
Haematocrit elevations (>0.55) were reported for 2 patients (0.9%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 
no patients in the EQW+placebo group, and 4 patients (1.7%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.  None 
of these events were associated with AEs. 
Elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase accompanied by elevations in total 
bilirubin 
One patient (E7886303) in the EQW+placebo group met biochemical Hy’s Law Criteria (ALT ≥3x upper 
limit of normal (ULN) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥3x ULN and total bilirubin ≥2x ULN).  The 
Assessment report

event was initially reported as an AE of elevated liver enzymes on Day 57 that was moderate in intensity 
and did not require additional treatment.  The investigator did not consider this event an SAE; however, 
the investigator was asked to upgrade the event to an SAE based on protocol specifications.  This event 
was adjudicated by a blinded adjudication committee as unlikely to be causally related to study drug. 
Urinalysis  
Mean urine glucose/creatinine ratio increased from baseline in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, did not 
increase in the EQW+placebo group, and showed the greatest increase from baseline in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo group over time.  These findings are consistent with the MOA of dapagliflozin. 
Vital signs  
Pulse rate increased from baseline in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (mean change from baseline at Week 
28 was 2.1 bpm).  In the EQW+placebo group, mean change from baseline was 0.7 bpm. Pulse rate 
remained stable during the study in the dapagliflozin+placebo group (mean change from baseline was 
-0.1 bpm). 
Few patients had a documented BP value <90/55 mmHg at any time in the study (Table 15).  Between 
19% and 32% of patients had decreases in SBP of >20 mmHg or DBP of >10 mmHg; the incidence of 
these findings was similar in the EQW+dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin+placebo groups, and slightly higher 
than in the EQW+placebo group.

Anti-exenatide antibodies  
A majority of patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin and EQW+placebo groups developed anti-exenatide 
antibodies at some point over the 28-week treatment period.  Patients with positive antibodies had a 
higher rate of injection-site-related AEs. 
Anti-exenatide antibodies were observed in 74.4% of patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin group and 76.1% 
of patients in the EQW+placebo group at any time during the study.  The EQW+dapagliflozin group 
showed a greater percentage of patients (41.7%) with high positive antibody titres as compared to the 
EQW+placebo group (28.0%).  The proportion of patients positive for anti-exenatide antibodies plateaued 
at Week 8 and remained stable through the end of the 28-week treatment period.  
The mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar across anti-exenatide antibody status and titre at 
Week 28 in both the EQW+dapagliflozin and EQW+placebo groups.  Injection site-related AEs were more 
common among patients who were positive for exenatide anti-exenatide antibodies (10.8% in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group and 10.4% in the EQW+placebo group) compared to patients who were 
negative (1.3% for both subgroups).

Safety in special populations 
No data provided. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No data provided. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rate of discontinuations due to AEs was low in all groups.  More patients discontinued due to AEs in 
the EQW+dapagliflozin (3.9%) and EQW+placebo (4.8%) groups than in the dapagliflozin+placebo group 
(2.1%).   
The most commonly reported AE leading to discontinuation of EQW/placebo or dapagliflozin/placebo was 
nausea (1.0% overall), reported by 1 patient (0.4%) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 5 patients (2.2%) 
in the EQW+placebo group, and 1 patient (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin+placebo group.  At the PT level, no 
other AE leading to discontinuation was reported by more than 1 patient per treatment group. 
Post marketing experience 
Limited data are available from post-marketing reports of concomitant use of EQW+dapagliflozin. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
With study D5553C00003, 28 week data on the concomitant treatment with exenatide and dapagliflozin 
has been provided. A total of 694 patients were included in the study out of which 231 received the 
combined treatment. The mean duration of exposure to both exenatide and dapagliflozin was about 180 
days with a slightly shorter exposure for active EQW than for active dapagliflozin. 
The overall reporting of AEs was somewhat higher in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (57%) compared to 
the EQW group (54%) and the dapagliflozin group (52%).  
Treatment related AEs were more common in the EQW treated groups (EQW+dapagliflozin, 26%; EQW 
23%) than in the dapagliflozin treated group (16%). 
Common adverse events constituted about 40% of all AEs in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 45% in the 
EQW group and 32% in the dapagliflozin group. GI events were more common with EQW than with 
dapagliflozin. Injection site nodules were observed in all treatment groups, most common with 
EQW+dapagliflozin (7.8%) but common also with placebo (5.2%). UTIs were fairly balanced but most 
common with dapagliflozin (5.6% vs 4.3% with EQW+dapagliflozin and 5.2% with EQW). 
For the SOCs with the greatest frequency of AEs, the reporting was rather well balanced between groups. 
Headache, dizziness, dermatitis, and rash were more common in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (4.8%, 
3.5%, 1.3%, and 0.9%, respectively) compared to the EQW+placebo (3.5%, 0.4%, 0%, and 0.4%, 
respectively) and dapagliflozin+placebo groups (3.0%, 1.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).  One patient in 
the EQW+placebo group had an AE of diabetic ketoacidosis.  No malignancies were reported during the 
study other than skin neoplasms.  
AEs judged as drug related were mainly GI events and injection site reactions, in line with the known 
safety profile for exenatide. 
Five deaths occurred during the study, 3 of which were in the EQW+dapagliflozin groups. Two of these 
deaths were due to trauma/suicide. The three remaining deaths were all CV deaths, one in each 
treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 37/51 
 
  
  
The overall reporting of SAEs was balanced between groups. There were more SAEs in the SOC GI 
disorders and hepatobiliary disorders for EQW+dapagliflozin (4 and 3) than with EQW (0 and 1) whereas 
no such events were reported for dapagliflozin. Two anaphylactic reactions were reported, one in the 
EQW group and one in the dapagliflozin group. At the PT level, no SAE was reported by more than 1 
patient per treatment group and no specific patterns could be observed. 
Hypoglycaemia was an AE of special interest in the study. As expected, the incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was low and no events met the criteria of minor or major hypoglycaemia. A total of 8 patients (3.5%) in 
the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 3 patients (1.3%) in the EQW+placebo group, and 3 patients (1.3%) in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo group had hypoglycaemia events with glucose values ranging from 3.0 mmol/L to 
4.2 mmol/L. 
With regards to other AEs of special interest, CV events were few and balanced between groups. Two 
patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin group and 3 patients in the dapagliflozin group reported events 
potentially volume depletion-related. One pancreatitis related event was reported each in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin and EQW group. Two patients in the EQW group and one in the dapagliflozin group 
had events related to acute renal failure. There were no cases of pancreatic or thyroid cancer. 
Comparable rates of injection site reactions were observed in the two EQW groups (12%) and 7% of 
patients in the dapagliflozin+placebo group reported such events. 
Gastrointestinal-related events were equally common in the two EQW groups (15.6 and 15.2%), but 
rather common also in the dapagliflozin group (12%). The findings in the EQW groups were expected 
based on the increased rate of GI events observed with EQW in previous studies. 
Increases in haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed in both dapagliflozin groups, consistent with 
changes observed in the dapagliflozin programme. Decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit were 
observed in the EQW group. A slight decrease in eGFR was observed in all three groups, most pronounced 
in the dapagliflozin group. Creatinine elevations >1.5 ULN were most common in the EQW+dapagliflozin 
group (6.1%) and less common in the monotherapy groups (3.9% in both groups). Many events were 
one-time elevations. Haematocrit elevations (>0.55) were most common in the dapagliflozin group 
(1.7%) and in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (0.9). 
One patient in the EQW group met biochemical Hy´s law criteria. This was not related to treatment but to 
underlying hepatobiliary disease. 
An increase in heart rate was observed in the EQW treated groups with the most pronounced increase 
(2.1 bpm) in the EQW+dapagliflozin group. These findings are consistent with results observed in other 
EQW studies. No increase was observed in the dapagliflozin group. 
Only one patient in the dapagliflozin group had a SBP <90 mmHg. Two patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin 
group and 4 in the dapagliflozin group had DBP <55 at any time of the study. Between 20-30% of 
patients had a >20 mmHg decrease in SBP (lowest in the EQW group) and 26-32% had a >10 mmHg 
decrease in DBP (lowest rate in the EQW group). 
About 75% of patients in both groups treated with EQW developed anti-exenatide antibodies at any time-
point during the study. Although a larger proportion of patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin treated group 
(42%) had high positive titres at any time point compared to patients on EQW monotherapy (28%) there 
was no apparent difference between treatment arms at the time-points when antibodies were measures 
(week 4, 8, 12, 20 and 28). The rate of high antibody titres at study endpoint was consistent with the 
rate observed in a previous comparable study with EQW. 
The occurrence of antibodies did not affect the effect on HbA1c but injection site-related events were 
more common in patients with ADA. Increased injection site related AEs in patients with positive 
antibodies have also been observed in previous EQW studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 38/51 
 
  
  
Safety data was also presented by age groups < 65 years and ≥ 65 years. Due to the imbalance in the 
number of patients in each group (607 patients < 65 years and 87 patients ≥ 65 years) the interpretation 
of data has to be made with caution. There was no apparent difference in the overall reporting of AEs 
between age groups and the reporting was numerically lower in the older age. Nor was there any 
apparent difference in the pattern of AEs reported. The only finding of some significance was the 
observation that the decrease in eGFR observed at week 1 was more pronounced in the older age group. 
The recovery was also smaller in this age group at week 28. 
Apart from this finding, the data presented give no indication on a difference in the safety profile for the 
combination therapy or the single components across the two age groups. 
The safety data reported with the 52 week CSR did not reveal any new safety concerns. The overall 
reporting of AEs was slightly higher in the EQW+dapa group and comparable in the two monotherapy 
arms. The reporting of AEs was lower during the extension phase of the study and there was change in 
the pattern of reported AEs. Seven SAEs were reported during the extension phase (1 in the EQW+dapa 
group, 4 in the EQW+placebo group and 2 in the dapa+placebo group). Among these events, 1 event of 
renal neoplasm was reported in the EQW+placebo group. There were no deaths during extension phase of 
the study. There were no events of major hypoglycaemia during the extension phase. In total 24 patients 
reported hypoglycaemias and the reporting was slightly higher with the combination treatment. There 
was a decrease in the proportion of patients with positive antibody titers from week 28 to week 52. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data provided with study D5553C00003 is in line with the known safety profile for exenatide 
and dapagliflozin. There was no indication of added toxicity in the group on combination therapy although 
the overall reporting of AEs was slightly higher in this group compared to monotherapy. No new safety 
concerns that arise from the data presented (up to 52 weeks of treatment).  
2.4.3.  PSUR cycle

(1)To establish a multicentre 
registry of incident cases of 
MTC in adults in the US in 
order to characterize their 
medical histories and 
possible risk factors, 
including history of treatment 
with EQW and other long-
acting GLP-1RAs; (2) To 
systematically monitor the 
annual incidence of MTC in 
the US through the NAACCR 
to identify any possible 
increase related to the 
introduction of EQW and 
other long-acting GLP-1RAs 
into the US market 
The primary objective of this 
study is to test the 
hypothesis that glycaemic 
control, as measured by 
change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint, with 
exenatide BID daily is 
superior (in at least 1 of the 
exenatide treatment arms) to 
that of placebo after 28 
weeks of treatment in 
adolescent patients with 
T2DM who are naïve to 
antidiabetes agents, or 
patients who are being 
treated with metformin, an 
SU, or a combination of 
metformin and an SU. 
Primary objectives: To assess 
the effect on glycaemic 
control, as measured by 
HbA1c, of exenatide QW 
following 14 weeks of 
treatment compared to 
placebo in adolescents with 
T2DM; to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of exenatide 
QW compared to placebo 
following 14 weeks of 
treatment in adolescents with

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study D5553C00003 was a 28-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre, Phase 3b 
efficacy and safety study of simultaneous administration of exenatide (EQW) 2 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg 
od compared to EQW 2 mg + placebo and dapagliflozin 10 mg od + placebo in patients with T2DM. The 
patients were to have inadequate glycaemic control on metformin as reflected by HbA1c between 8% and 
12%. The total study duration will be 2 years; this submission presents data from the 28-week main 
treatment period. The rationale for choosing the combination of a GLP1-RA (exenatide) and a SGLT2-
inhibitor (dapagliflozin) is based on the complementary MOAs of the two different drugs. The three-armed 
study designs allows for assessment of the contribution of each of the components to the effect of the 
combined therapy. 
The primary objective of the study was met since the difference in HbA1c mean change from baseline 
week 28 in the primary analysis was -0.38 (-0.63, -0.13; p=0.003) for EQW+dapagliflozin vs 
EQW+placebo and -0.59 (-0.84, -0.34; p<0.001) for EQW+dapagliflozin vs dapagliflozin+placebo. Thus 
superiority of the combined treatment over each of the monotherapies was shown. The contribution of 
exenatide (-0.59%) to the effect of the combination was larger than that of dapagliflozin (-0.38%).  
The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 28 was 44.7% in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 
26.9% in the EQW+placebo group, and 19.1% in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. The difference 
between the EQW+dapagliflozin group and EQW+placebo group was 17.4% (p<0.001) and between the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group and dapagliflozin+placebo group was 25.6% (p<0.001).  
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint. There was a statistically significant 
interaction with age. Older patients (≥65 years) showed an overall greater effect of the combination than 
younger patients (<65 years) (-2.39% vs -1.91%). The effect of both monotherapies was lower in older 
patients compared to younger patients, with the largest difference between age groups observed with 
dapagliflozin. 
The subgroup analysis by HbA1c showed that the effect of both the combination and the monotherapies 
was, as expected, most pronounced in patients with HbA1c ≥9%. The outcome of the primary analysis 
was only preserved in patients with HbA1c 8-9%, thus the combination was superior to both 
monotherapies in this group.  In the subgroup of patients with HbA1c ≥9%, which constitutes the largest 
subgroup, the combination was only superior to monotherapy with dapagliflozin and in the smallest 
subgroup with HbA1c <8%, superiority of the combination was not shown over any of the monotherapies. 
A similar pattern, with more responders with combination therapy and less for the single components, 
was observed for all three subgroups. Although the change in HbA1c is most pronounced in the subgroup 
with HbA1c > 9% at baseline, the responder rate in this subgroup is lower than in the subgroups with 
lower baseline HbA1c as may be expected. 
Body weight decreased with -3.6 kg in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, with -1.6 kg in the EQW+placebo 
group, and with -2.2 kg in the dapagliflozin+placebo group. Thus there was an additive effect on body 
weight by the combination.  
An additive effect was also observed on SBP at Week 28. SBP decreased by -4.3 mmHg in the 
EQW+dapagliflozin group, -1.2 mmHg in the EQW+placebo group, and -1.8 mmHg in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo group.  
Efficacy data up to 52 weeks has been provided. There was a slight increase in HbA1c of about 0.2% in 
all treatment groups between week 28 and week 52 but an adequate effect was maintained and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 46/51 
 
  
  
differences observed between treatment arms at week 28 were essentially maintained. The body weight 
remained essentially stable in all treatment groups between week 28 and 52 with only a slight increase. 
The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% decreased with about 10 % in the EQW+dapa group 
and about 5% in the monotherapy groups between week 28 and 52. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The duration of the favourable effects has only been studied up to 52 weeks. However, at 52 weeks, only 
a slight attenuation of the effect was observed. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
With study D5553C00003, 28 week data on the concomitant treatment with exenatide and dapagliflozin 
has been provided. A total of 694 patients were included in the study out of which 231 received the 
combined treatment. The mean duration of exposure to both exenatide and dapagliflozin was about 180 
days with a slightly shorter exposure for active EQW than for active dapagliflozin. 
The overall reporting of AEs was somewhat higher in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (57%) compared to 
the EQW group (54%) and the dapagliflozin group (52%).  
Treatment related AEs were more common in the EQW treated groups (EQW+dapagliflozin, 26%; EQW 
23%) than in the dapagliflozin treated group (16%). 
Common adverse events constituted about 40% of all AEs in the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 45% in the 
EQW group and 32% in the dapagliflozin group. GI events were more common with EQW than with 
dapagliflozin. Injection site nodules were observed in all treatment groups, most common with 
EQW+dapagliflozin (7.8%) but common also with placebo (5.2%). UTIs were fairly balanced but most 
common with dapagliflozin (5.6% vs 4.3% with EQW+dapagliflozin and 5.2% with EQW). 
For the SOCs with the highest frequency of AEs, the reporting appeared balanced between groups. 
Headache, dizziness, dermatitis, and rash were more common in the EQW+dapagliflozin group (4.8%, 
3.5%, 1.3%, and 0.9%, respectively) compared to the EQW+placebo (3.5%, 0.4%, 0%, and 0.4%, 
respectively) and dapagliflozin+placebo groups (3.0%, 1.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).  One patient in 
the EQW+placebo group had an AE of diabetic ketoacidosis.  No malignancies were reported during the 
study other than skin neoplasms.  
AEs judged as drug related were mainly GI events and injection site reactions, in line with the known 
safety profile for exenatide. 
The overall reporting of SAEs was balanced between groups. There were more SAEs in the SOC GI 
disorders and hepatobiliary disorders for EQW+dapagliflozin (4 and 3) than with EQW (0 and 1) whereas 
no such events were reported for dapagliflozin. Two anaphylactic reactions were reported, one in the 
EQW group and one in the dapagliflozin group.  
Hypoglycaemia was an AE of special interest in the study. As expected, the incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was low and no events met the criteria of minor or major hypoglycaemia. A total of 8 patients (3.5%) in 
the EQW+dapagliflozin group, 3 patients (1.3%) in the EQW+placebo group, and 3 patients (1.3%) in the 
dapagliflozin+placebo group had hypoglycaemia events with glucose values ranging from 3.0 mmol/L to 
4.2 mmol/L. 
A comparable proportion of patients in both groups treated with EQW developed anti-exenatide antibodies 
(about 75%), however, a larger proportion of patients in the EQW+dapagliflozin treated group (42%) had 
Assessment report  
EMA/538242/2017 
Page 47/51 
 
  
  
high positive titres compared to patients on EQW monotherapy (28%). The MAH is asked to discuss if 
there is any biological rationale for this observed difference. 
The occurrence of antibodies did not affect the effect on HbA1c but injection site-related events were 
more common in patients with ADA. 
Safety data was also presented by age groups < 65 years and ≥ 65 years. Due to the imbalance in the 
number of patients in each group (607 patients < 65 years and 87 patients ≥ 65 years) the interpretation 
of data has to be made with caution. There was no apparent difference in the overall reporting of AEs 
between age groups and the reporting was numerically lower in the older age. Nor was there any 
apparent difference in the pattern of AEs reported. The only finding of some significance was the 
observation that the decrease in eGFR observed at week 1 was more pronounced in the older age group. 
The recovery was also smaller in this age group at week 28. Apart from this finding, the data presented 
give no indication on a difference in the safety profile for the combination therapy or the single 
components across the two age groups. 
The safety data reported for the extension of the study, with 52 week of exposure to the combination 
treatment, did not reveal any new safety concerns. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety data available only covers 52 weeks of exposure, however, the reporting of AEs decreased 
over time and no new safety concerns arose during the extension of the study.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Study D5553C00003 provides short-term (28 weeks) data on combined treatment with a GLP1-RA 
(exenatide) and a SGLT2-inhibitor (dapagliflozin). The population of T2DM patients included were in 
rather poor metabolic control with a mean HbA1c in baseline of 9.3%. The combination therapy resulted 
in a clinically relevant HbA1c reduction of almost 2%. The largest contribution appears to be from 
exenatide, whereas the contribution from dapagliflozin was less prominent. However, when taking the 
rate of responders into account, there was a clinically relevant increase in the rate of responders both in 
comparison to EQW and dapagliflozin monotherapy.  
In addition to the effects on metabolic control, additive effects on both body weight and SBP were 
observed. The magnitude of these effects is considered clinically relevant, especially as longer term data 
(52 week) show that this effect is maintained over time. 
The safety data provided does not indicate that there is any additive toxicity or change in the safety 
profile when exenatide is used concomitantly with dapagliflozin. There was a somewhat higher reporting 
of AEs in the EQW+dapagliflozin treated group but the pattern of reported events did not differ compared 
to the known safety profile for each of the monotherapies. A somewhat higher occurrence of high titers of 
anti-exenatide antibodies was observed with combined treatment which possibly explains the higher 
reporting of injection site reactions in this group. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit risk balance for the combined use of exenatide and dapagliflozin is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
T2DM is a progressive disease where metabolic control is often difficult to achieve. Once life style changes 
are insufficient to maintain metabolic control, metformin remains the first step in pharmaceutical 
Assessment report

Page 49/51 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment. Upon failure on metformin, current treatment guidelines recommend individualised treatment, 
combining existing treatment options based on the patient’s needs. A majority of T2DM patients is 
overweight and hypertensive, thus there is a need for treatment options which at least not aggravate 
these conditions.  
Concomitant treatment with exenatide and dapagliflozin resulted in a significantly greater reduction of 
HbA1c when compared to exenatide or dapagliflozin alone. Both agents have weight and blood pressure 
reducing properties and an additive effect was observed in the study. 
The beneficial effects were achieved without any substantial change in the safety profile known for the 
two agents. 
The combination of exenatide with dapagliflozin could therefore be an important treatment option in 
patients where further weight increase or increase in blood pressure needs to be avoided and when there 
is a need for improvement of the metabolic control. 
Since the initial authorisation of exenatide once weekly, the wording of the indication for medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes has evolved, and in addition more data, including from study 
D5553C00003 (Duration 8 study),  has been accumulated regarding the combined use of exenatide once 
weekly with other products for the treatment of diabetes representing the standard of care. Therefore, 
the wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC refers now in more general terms to the 
combined use of exenatide once weekly with other products for the treatment of diabetes. Although the 
wording of the indication is relatively broad, the combinations studied are clearly described in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bydureon is positive.

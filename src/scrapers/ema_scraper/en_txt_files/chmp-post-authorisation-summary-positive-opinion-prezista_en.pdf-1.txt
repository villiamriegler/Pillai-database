Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Prezista 
darunavir 
On 20 January 2011 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Prezista. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag 
International N.V.. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify 
the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a change to an indication as follows: 
“Prezista 400 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens: 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-experienced adults with no darunavir resistance associated 
mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count 
≥ 100 cells x 106/l. In deciding to initiate treatment with Prezista in such ART-experienced adults 
genotypic testing should guide the use of Prezista.” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indications for Prezista 400mg tablets will be as follows2: 
“Prezista, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. 
Prezista 400 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see section 4.2):

1.  Introduction 
On October 15, 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Modigraf (CSR F506CL-
0403), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the follow up measure FUM008. Modigraf received a 
marketing authorisation from the European commission in May 2009 for the indication of prophylaxis 
and treatment of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients. 
In the opinion of the CHMP, the available pharmacokinetic data were considered limited in the 
paediatric population. This study therefore was performed to provide greater understanding of the 
pharmacokinetics in patients 12 years or younger undergoing liver, kidney or heart transplantation and 
forms an integral part of the follow up measures agreed to by the MAH. 
The MAH does not suggest any updates of the Modigraf SmPC. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study (A multicentre, open-label, PK study of Modigraf (tacrolimus granules) 
in de novo paediatric allograft recipients) is a stand-alone study following the procedure for an art 46 
paediatric study report. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The formulation used in the study is the same as the formulation currently marketed in the EU. The 
Marketing Authorisation of Modigraf in the EU already includes a full paediatric indication. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  Study F506CL-0403:  A multicentre, open-label, PK study of Modigraf (tacrolimus granules) in de 
novo paediatric allograft recipients 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study F506-CL-0403 was a multicentre, open-label, single arm, phase 4 study designed to determine 
the pharmacokinetics of systemic tacrolimus following oral administration of Modigraf® (tacrolimus 
granules), after the first oral dose and at steady state in paediatric patients undergoing de novo liver, 
kidney or heart transplantation. 
In the words of the MAH, the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice, ICH guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Methods 
Objective 
•  Primary objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus following oral administration 
of Modigraf, after the first oral dose and at steady state in paediatric patients undergoing de novo 
allograft transplantation. 
•  Secondary objective: To determine safety and efficacy of Modigraf 
Study design 
This was a multicentre, open-label, single arm study. 
Study population 
Paediatric patients undergoing liver, kidney or heart transplantation (or multiorgan transplants as long 
as one of the organs transplanted was liver, kidney or heart) and meeting the inclusion criteria and not 
meeting any of the exclusion criteria prior to initiation of tacrolimus therapy were enrolled. Modigraf 
was specifically targeted for the paediatric population and for this reason it was deemed necessary to 
collect data from the 12-year-old and under age group, which represents the population most likely to 
have some difficulty or be unable to swallow capsule formulations. Prior to enrolment, IC was obtained 
from the patient’s parent(s) or their legal representative(s). Assent from the patient was also obtained 
where applicable. 
The exclusion criteria included: 
1.  The patient had previously received another organ transplant. 
2.  Patient had a high immunological risk, defined as a panel reactive antibody score > 50% in the 
previous 6 months (only applicable for renal transplant recipients). 
3.  Cold ischemia time of the donor kidney greater than 30 h (only applicable for renal transplant 
recipients). 
4.  Patient received an ABO incompatible donor organ. 
5.  Patient had significant renal impairment, defined as having serum creatinine ≥230 µmol/L 
(≥2.6 mg/dL) pretransplantation (not applicable for renal transplant recipients). 
6.  Patient had significant liver disease, defined as having elevated ALT and/or AST and/or total 
bilirubin levels 3 times the upper value of the normal range during the 28 days prior to 
transplantation (not applicable for liver transplant recipients). 
7.  Patient with pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 Wood units which was unresponsive to 
treatment. 
8.  Patients with malignancies or a history of malignancy within the last 5 years. 
9.  Patient had a significant, uncontrolled systemic infection and/or severe diarrhoea, vomiting, active 
upper gastrointestinal disorder that may have affected the absorption of tacrolimus or has an 
active peptic ulcer. 
10.  Patient required systemic immunosuppressive medication for any indication other than 
transplantation. 
11.  Recipient or donor known to be HIV, HCV or HBV positive.

12.  Known allergy or intolerance to steroids, macrolide antibiotics, basiliximab or tacrolimus. 
13.  Patient was participating in another clinical trial and/or has been taking an investigational drug in 
the 3 months prior to transplantation. 
14.  Patient was unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol. Patients taking or 
requiring to be treated with medication or substances prohibited by this protocol. 
No power calculations had been performed; however based on previous experience from 
pharmacokinetic studies, 36 patients with 2 complete pharmacokinetic profiles, were likely to provide 
sufficient pharmacokinetic data. 
Treatments 
The initial daily dose for Modigraf was 0.3 mg/kg per day orally given in 2 doses (equals 0.15 mg/kg 
twice daily) postoperatively. The first dose of 0.15 mg/kg of tacrolimus was to be administered within 
24 h after reperfusion (this period may have been extended up to 5 days for heart transplant 
recipients). Subsequent oral tacrolimus doses were adjusted based on clinical evidence of efficacy and 
occurrence of adverse events, and observing the following recommended whole blood trough level 
range of 5 to 20 ng/ml. 
The initial dose and dose modification recommendations for all patients in this study were in line with 
the Modigraf SmPC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetics 
Two pharmacokinetic profiles were taken as follows: 
•  Profile 1: First dose of tacrolimus after reperfusion 
•  Profile 2: Day 7 (+ 7 days) after a minimum of 4 days without a dose change (due to the higher 
clearance in very young children this may have been possible after 3 days), when the patients are 
expected to be at steady state. 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus were determined: AUCtau, Cmax, tmax and 
Ctrough. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. Time of 
blood sampling was (hours after dosing): 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. The lower limit of 
quantification for tacrolimus in whole blood is 0.5 ng/mL. 
Efficacy 
The efficacy of Modigraf was described from the following parameters:  
● Rejection episodes: Acute rejection episodes; Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) episodes; 
Severity of BPAR.  
● Patient and graft survival: Death and reason for death; Graft loss and reason for graft loss. 
The histological evaluation of the biopsy was performed by the local histopathologist following the 
“Histological Grading of Liver Biopsies for Rejection”, the “Banff 97 diagnostic categories for renal 
allograft biopsies – Banff ’07 update” or the “standardised nomenclature of the International Society of 
Heart and Lung Transplantation”.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/417677/2016   
Page 4/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute rejection episodes were classified as Spontaneously Resolving Acute Rejection, Corticosteroid 
Sensitive Acute Rejection, Corticosteroid Resistant Acute Rejection, or Other Acute Rejection 
Definitions. 
Patient survival was defined as any patient known to be alive at week 2.  
Graft survival was defined as any patient who did not experience graft failure during the study. As this 
is a 2-week study, graft failure was defined as retransplantation, nephrectomy, requiring ongoing 
dialysis, or death. The date of graft failure was the earliest date of any of these events. Kidney 
transplanted patients who underwent a nephrectomy or who required ongoing dialysis were counted as 
patients with graft failure with the date of nephrectomy or the date of started dialysis as date of event. 
Safety 
AE collection began at the time of the first study related procedure at baseline (visit 1) and continued 
until up to 30 days after the final intake of study medication, i.e., even if they occurred after the ESV. 
The following standard with 3 grades was to be used to measure the severity of AEs, including 
abnormal clinical laboratory values. Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities; Moderate: Affects 
normal daily activities; Severe: Inability to perform daily activities.

Pharmacokinetic results 
Tacrolimus Mean Trough Levels by Visit 
The mean (SD) trough level of tacrolimus is shown in the table below (Table 21). All observed mean 
values by visit were included in the recommended level range of 5 to 20 ng/mL. 
In patients under 5 years of age, the mean (SD) trough level of tacrolimus was 8.86 (2.76) ng/mL in 
the heart transplant group, 14.20 (3.72) ng/mL in the liver transplant group and 9.73 (2.12) ng/mL in 
the kidney transplant group. In patients 5 years of age or older, the mean (SD) trough level of 
tacrolimus was 10.90 (2.91) ng/mL in the heart transplant group, 18.40 (7.72) ng/mL in the liver 
transplant group and 9.23 (2.28) ng/mL in the kidney transplant group. 
Most of the patients (96.2%) had their dose adjusted during the study. Increases and decreases of 
dose were similarly reported in the heart and liver transplant groups. However, more decreases than 
increases of dose were reported in the kidney transplant group (12 [80.0%] vs 8 [53.2%]). These 
characteristics were similar in both age subgroups (age <5 years and age ≥5 years).

Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Day 1: The mean AUCtau was 224.13 h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 210.56 h*ng/mL in 
patients with liver transplant and 97.40 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney transplant. Observations from 
studies in adult patients with heart, liver and kidney transplants have shown that the oral 
bioavailability was similar across different populations. However, a higher clearance has been observed 
from studies in adult patients with kidney transplant. Thus, the data generated from the current study 
in paediatric transplant patients are in line with the observations in adult populations. 
Overall, the mean AUCtau was 209.29 h*ng/mL in patients 5 years of age or older and 163.42 
h*ng/mL in patients under 5 years of age. 
Steady state: The mean AUCtau was 165.17 h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 
195.08 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 208.32 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney 
transplant. Overall, the mean AUCtau was 199.49 h*ng/mL in patients 5 years of age or older and 
184.78 h*ng/mL in patients under 5 years of age. See Table 28 below.

Overall, Ctrough and AUCtau were positively correlated both at day 1 and week 1 (Pearson’s 
coefficients were 0.81 and 0.87, respectively). Overall, similar positive correlations between Ctrough 
and AUCtau were shown in both age categories (< 5 years and ≥ 5 years). 
The MAH’s PK conclusions 
•  Out of 52 patients enrolled, 38 patients had 2 evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles (12 [70.6%] in 
the heart transplant group, 14 [70.0%] in the liver transplant group and 12 [80.0%] in the kidney 
transplant group). The number of patients in the age subgroups was small, with fewer patients in 
the (≥5 years) cohort than in the (<5 years) cohort (16 vs 36, respectively: 8 vs 9 in the heart 
transplant group, 3 vs 17 in the liver transplant group and 5 vs 10 in the kidney transplant group, 
respectively). 
•  Overall, the mean AUCtau for the first pharmacokinetic profile (day 1) was 224.13 h*ng/mL in 
patients with heart transplant, 210.56 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 97.40 h*ng/mL 
in patients with kidney transplant. The mean AUCtau for the second PK profile (week 1) was 165.17 
h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 195.08 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 
208.32 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney transplant. 
•  Overall, Ctrough and AUCtau were positively correlated both at day 1 and week 1 on the PKAS 
(Pearson’s coefficients were 0.81 and 0.87, respectively).

CHMP’s comment: 
When Modigraf received a marketing authorisation for the indication of prophylaxis and treatment of 
transplant rejection in adult and paediatric kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients, the available 
pharmacokinetic data were considered limited in the paediatric population by the CHMP. The MAH has 
therefore performed a study to provide greater understanding of the pharmacokinetics in patients 
12 years or younger. 
Tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, primarily eliminated via CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. In 
adults, the clearance of the compound has been shown to differ between healthy subjects and patients 
with increased clearance rates contributing to a shorter half-life in transplant recipients. In adult and 
paediatric liver transplant patients, the half-life of tacrolimus is 11.7 hours and 12.4 hours, 
respectively, compared with 15.6 hours in adult kidney transplant recipients. 
In the Modigraf SmPC, it is also stated that highly variable age dependent clearance and half-life have 
been observed in limited paediatric clinical investigations, especially in early childhood. It is therefore 
not fully understood why the MAH has chosen to display the PK results with an age cut off of 5 years 
old, since the children which potentially may differ in tacrolimus PK are expected to be younger than 
5 years. 
It should be noted that Modigraf dosing is primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and 
tolerability in each patient individually, aided by blood level monitoring. The recommended initial doses 
in the Modigraf SmPC are intended to act solely as a guideline. For these reasons the way that the 
MAH has analysed the PK data from the present study may be considered sufficient, even though 
model based analysis would have been preferred over non-compartmental analysis to obtain the most 
efficient use of data. However, to further support the dose recommendation the MAH is asked to 
display the parameters dose normalised AUCtau and Ctrough and/or estimated Cl with age as a 
continues variable. Plots with the PK parameter on the y axis and age on the x axis for both Day 1 and 
steady state should be provided. Based on the results, the MAH should further discuss whether the 
starting dose and dosing frequency is optimal across the entire age range investigated.

In the heart transplant group, 1 patient had a BPAR reported as mild in severity. In the liver transplant 
group, 1 patient had a BPAR classified as 4 – 5 (mild rejection) and 2 patients had a BPAR classified as 
6 – 7 (moderate rejection) according to the liver rejection activity index score. 
Death or graft loss 
There were no deaths or graft losses. 
The MAH’s efficacy conclusions 
−  Five patients experienced acute rejection episodes. In the heart transplant group, 2 patients 
had rejections with 1 classified as a BPAR. In the liver transplant group, 3 patients had 
rejections and all were classified as BPAR. No rejection occurred in the kidney transplant 
group.  
−  There were no deaths or graft losses. 
Safety results 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar in patients under 5 years of age and 5 years of age or older (32 
[88.9%] and 14 [87.5%], respectively.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs in patients less than 5 years of age were hypertension (9 [25.0%] 
patients) followed by diarrhea (6 [16.7%] patients), vomiting, toxicity to various agents, metabolic 
acidosis, pyrexia, anemia and blood creatinine increased (5 [13.9%] patients each). The most

commonly reported TEAEs in patients 5 years of age or older were hypertension and hypokalemia (4 
[25.0%] patients each). 
There were 7 (13.5%) patients who reported 12 severe TEAEs. None of the severe TEAEs led to study 
discontinuation. 
Overall, a total of 19 serious TEAEs were reported by 17 (32.7%) patients (4 [23.5%] patients with 
heart transplant, 9 [45.0%] patients with liver transplant and 4 [26.7%] patients with kidney 
transplant). The SOCs for which serious TEAEs were most commonly reported were “injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications” (4 [7.7%] patients) followed by “hepatobiliary disorders” and “
investigations” (3 [5.8%] patients each). The most commonly reported serious TEAEs were toxicity to 
various agents and blood creatinine increased (3 [5.8%] patients each). 
Overall, the highest incidence of high biochemistry potentially clinically significant (PCS) cuts for 
pediatrics was for alkaline phosphatase (34 [66.7%] patients) followed by AST (25 [48.1%] patients) 
and GGT (23 [45.1%] patients). The highest incidence of low biochemistry PCS cuts for pediatrics was 
for creatinine (36 [69.2%] patients) and total bilirubin (23 [44.2%] patients). 
A mean decrease from baseline of eGFR was shown at weeks 1 and 2 in patients with heart and liver 
transplants (-9.0 and -16.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 and -53.0 and -52.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). At 
day 1, a mean decrease of eGFR from baseline was shown in patients with heart transplant whereas a 
mean increase of eGFR from baseline was shown in patients with liver transplant (-9.3 and 7.8 
mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively).

The MAH’s safety conclusions 
−  Overall, 46 (88.5%) patients reported at least 1 TEAE. The most frequently reported common (
≥ 10% in any organ transplant) TEAEs were hypertension (13 [25.0%] patients) followed by 
diarrhea (9 [17.3%] patients) and vomiting (8 [15.4%] patients).  
−  Overall, 34 (65.4%) patients reported at least 1 drug-related TEAE. The most commonly 
reported drug-related TEAEs were hypertension (10 [19.2%] patients) followed by toxicity to 
various agents (6 [11.5%] patients).  
−  Overall, 17 (32.7%) patients reported at least 1 serious TEAE. The most commonly reported 
serious TEAEs were toxicity to various agents and blood creatinine increased (3 [5.8%] 
patients each).  
−  One patient with liver transplant reported 2 TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation.

−  The incidence of TEAEs was similar in patients under 5 years of age and in patients 5 years of 
age or older (32 [88.9%] and 14 [87.5%], respectively). No unexpected clinically relevant 
differences between both age categories were identified.  
−  Overall, there were no unexpected clinically relevant changes in laboratory evaluations or vital 
signs results.  
−  There were no deaths. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided pharmacokinetic data from children 12 years old and younger. Any updates of 
the SmPC are not suggested.  
In the first round of assessment, some additional clarifications were requested from the MAH. A 
requested analysis with age as a continuous variable was provided, and no obvious relation was 
detected. The MAH explains that this is expected, during the immediate post-transplant period, many 
factors (e g hematocrit and plasma albumin) influence the PK of tacrolimus, and there is a high inter- 
and intra-patient variability. In this period, dose is a poor predictor of exposure, and after the fixed 
starting dose the subsequent doses are based on therapeutic drug monitoring. The MAH explains that 
the approved starting dose has been evaluated in phase 2/3 trials and no change is indicated based on 
the new data. This is agreed.  
The MAH also provided a discussion on the relevance of Ctrough as a surrogate for AUCtau. As Ctrough 
is the most used and validated surrogate marker for TDM, it is agreed that exploring other surrogate 
time points would be beyond the scope of this procedure. A discussion was also provided regarding the 
changes in tacrolimus PK over time, and it was concluded that the current data cannot be used to 
explore such changes further.  
As a secondary objective also efficacy and safety data was collected in the study and non-randomised 
two weeks data reported in heart transplantation (n=17), liver transplantation (n=20), and kidney 
transplantation (n=15), including 30 days safety follow-up. The overall mean age was 4.3 years with 
almost 70% of patients below the age of 5 years, and the median duration of study drug exposure 12 
days in the heart and kidney transplant groups and 14 days in the liver transplant group. 
No graft losses or deaths were reported. Acute rejection was observed in 5 patients: 2 in the heart 
group whereof 1 BPAR and 3 in the liver group whereof all BPARs; 2 of the latter were classified as 
moderate rejection. 
Serious TEAEs were recorded in 17 (33%) patients. Seven (14%) patients reported 12 severe TEAEs. 
One patient in the liver group had the study drug discontinued due to TEAEs. The overall incidence of 
TEAEs was similar in the above and below 5 years age groups. 
Given the non-randomised design, short study duration and small patient groups, no decisive 
conclusions on efficacy and safety can be drawn from this study. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
A study report providing some new information of the PK and PD of tacrolimus in children has been 
submitted, and the data has been discussed. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics is very variable and 
dependent on many factors apart from age, and dosing is based on therapeutic drug monitoring. It is

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/417677/2016   
Page 18/22 
 
 
 
 
 
agreed that the new data does not suggest any need for a modification of the starting dose 
recommendation in children. The MAH does not suggest any changes in the SmPC, which is supported.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No further regulatory actions needed. 
Additional clarifications requested 
For questions in the first round of assessment, see below. 
Assessment of the MAH´s responses to the additional 
clarifications requested 
The MAH has provided their response to the additional clarifications requested. A general description of 
the use of tacrolimus in children, the role of TDM and the impact of factors other than age on the PK of 
tacrolimus has been provided. The MAH´s concludes that the new data is limited, and does not suggest 
any need for an updated dosing instruction in children. This is agreed.  
Question 1 Regarding Table 28, it appears that the column headers Cmax and Tmax have been 
switched. The MAH should clarify. 
MAH´s comment 
The MAH agrees and is in the process of issuing an erratum as a corrected page 
CHMP´s comment: 
The MAH will update the table.  
Issue solved. 
Question 2 The MAH should clarify why a cut off of 5 years old has been used when analysing the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data, since the children which potentially may differ in tacrolimus PK are 
expected to be younger than 5 years. 
MAH´s comment: 
In the original protocol that was approved by the CHMP, there was no intention of analyzing PK as a 
function of age as the sample size in this study was too small to merit such evaluations.  
CHMP´s comment: 
The study size and the many confounding factors are acknowledged, limiting the possibility to address 
the effect of age on tacrolimus PK from the current data. In addition, the MAH has provided a plot with 
age as a continuous variable, see below. 
Issue solved.

Question 3. To further support the current dose recommendations, the MAH is asked to display 
tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters using age as a continues variable. Plots with PK parameter (e g 
dose normalised AUCtau and Ctrough and/or estimated clearance, respectively) on the y axis and age 
on the x axis for both Day 1 and steady state should be provided. Based on the results, the MAH 
should further discuss whether the starting dose and dosing frequency is optimal across the entire age 
range investigated.  
MAH´s comment: 
To ensure that an appropriate systemic exposure is achieved, the prevailing practice is to conduct TDM 
based on the trough whole blood concentrations (Ctrough). Although tacrolimus systemic exposure 
(AUCtau) is the critical parameter for both safety and efficacy in transplant recipients (Undre et al, 
1999 and Kuypers et al 2004) AUC monitoring is not practical in routine clinical practice. For this 
reason, Ctrough is used as a surrogate of overall exposure. The relationship between Ctrough and 
AUCtau has been evaluated in study F506-CL-0403. Overall, Ctrough and AUCtau were positively 
correlated both at day 1 and week 1 (Pearson’s coefficients were 0.81 and 0.87, respectively). This is a 
more relevant parameter for TDM.  
However, as discussed above, a relationship between age and PK parameter of exposure is not 
expected during the early post-transplant period owing to several confounding factors. Nevertheless, 
MAH has examined the relationship between age and AUCtau for the first profile and this is presented 
in Figure below. 
As expected there is no correlation between age (range 0.33 to 12.5 years) and AUCtau at a fixed dose 
of 0.15 mg/kg (equivalent to a daily dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day) recommended as starting dose. These 
data suggest that it is not possible to define the starting dose based on individual patient’s age.

CHMP´s comment: 
The MAH has provided the requested analysis with age as a continuous variable, and no obvious 
relation was detected.  
The MAH explains that this is expected, during the immediate post-transplant period, many factors (e 
g hematocrit and plasma albumin) influence the PK of tacrolimus, and there is a high inter- and intra-
patient variability. In this period, dose is a poor predictor of exposure, and after the fixed starting dose 
the subsequent doses are based on therapeutic drug monitoring. The MAH explains that the approved 
starting dose has been evaluated in phase 2/3 trials and no change is indicated based on the new data. 
This is agreed.  
Issue solved 
Question 4. The MAH is also asked to comment on the use of Ctrough concentrations as a surrogate 
for AUCtau in this study considering that numerous studies have suggested inadequacy of Ctrough in 
reflecting total drug exposure. The MAH is asked to comment on alternative surrogate time points (e g 
2 or 3 hours post-dose) to estimate AUC0-12 in this population. 
MAH´s comment: 
Although a number of publications have suggested alternative surrogate marker for TDM, Ctrough 
remains the most used and validated surrogate for TDM. This issue was discussed by a group of 
experts, and they have reached a consensus position (Wallemacq et al, 2009). The consensus paper 
defines that Ctrough as optimal surrogate marker for TDM.  
It is also important to note that Ctrough has been successfully used to optimize tacrolimus based 
immunosuppressive therapy in children for more than 2 decades; if an alternative surrogate is desired, 
it will need to undergo full clinical validation through randomized control trials.  
CHMP´s comment: 
The MAH describes Ctrough as the most used and validated surrogate marker for TDM, and it is agreed 
that exploring other surrogate time points would be beyond the scope of this procedure.  
Issue solved 
Question 5. Considering that physiological modifications (such as haematocrit level and those related 
to growth) are expected to occur during the first year post-transplantation in young transplanted 
patients and that cellular rejection episodes may occur up to 12 months post-surgery, the MAH is 
asked to comment on how these modifications may impact tacrolimus clearance after the early period, 
up to 1 year post-transplantation. 
MAH´s comment: 
F506-CL-0403 is limited in that it is only a 2 week study and therefore limited in what conclusions can 
be drawn. Data from studies in adult patients suggest that it takes between 6 weeks to 12 weeks for 
haematocrit, plasma protein to normalize (Undre et al 2000 kidney and Undre et al 1998 Liver). 
Although it is not possible to analyse the data from this short term PK study, data from the follow up 
study F506-CL-0404 may be able to provide further opportunity to evaluate impact of other factors on 
PK of tacrolimus. However, it is unlikely that with such small number of patients any meaningful 
conclusions can be elucidated.

CHMP´s comment: 
The MAH acknowledges that tacrolimus PK may change over time, depending on many factors. It is 
however agreed that data from the current study cannot be used to study long-term changes due to 
the short observation period. As regular monitoring of these patients is performed this is not 
considered a major issue.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab or venetoclax is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) (see section 5.1).
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for 
patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with this medicinal product should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced 
in the use of anticancer medicinal products.
Posology
MCL
The recommended dose for the treatment of MCL is 560 mg (four capsules) once daily.
CLL and WM
The recommended dose for the treatment of CLL and WM, either as a single agent or in combination, 
is 420 mg (three capsules) once daily (for details of the combination regimens, see section 5.1).
Treatment with IMBRUVICA should continue until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the 
patient. In combination with venetoclax for the treatment of CLL, IMBRUVICA should be 
administered as a single agent for 3 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days), followed by 12 cycles of 
IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax. See the venetoclax Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for 
full venetoclax dosing information.
2
When administering IMBRUVICA in combination with anti-CD20 therapy, it is recommended to 
administer IMBRUVICA prior to anti-CD20 therapy when given on the same day.
Dose adjustments
Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of ibrutinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
The dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 280 mg once daily (two capsules) when used concomitantly
with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.
The dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 140 mg once daily (one capsule) or withheld for up to 
7 days when it is used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
IMBRUVICA therapy should be withheld for any new onset or worsening grade 2 cardiac failure, 
grade 3 cardiac arrhythmias, grade ≥3 non-haematological toxicity, grade 3 or greater neutropenia with 
infection or fever, or grade 4 haematological toxicities. Once the symptoms of the toxicity have 
resolved to grade 1 or baseline (recovery), resume IMBRUVICA therapy at the recommended dose as 
per the tables below.

Missed dose
If a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a 
return to the normal schedule the following day. The patient should not take extra capsules to make up 
the missed dose.
Special populations
Elderly
No specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥65 years).
Renal impairment
No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment were treated in IMBRUVICA clinical studies. No dose adjustment is 
needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine 
clearance). Hydration should be maintained and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. 
Administer IMBRUVICA to patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min creatinine clearance) 
only if the benefit outweighs the risk and monitor patients closely for signs of toxicity. There are no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Ibrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In a hepatic impairment study, data showed an increase in 
ibrutinib exposure (see section 5.2). For patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh class A), the 
recommended dose is 280 mg daily (two capsules). For patients with moderate liver impairment 
(Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily (one capsule). Monitor patients for signs 
of IMBRUVICA toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed. It is not recommended to 
administer IMBRUVICA to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
Severe cardiac disease
Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from IMBRUVICA clinical studies.
Paediatric population
IMBRUVICA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years as efficacy 
has not been established. Currently available data in patients with mature B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.
Method of administration
IMBRUVICA should be administered orally once daily with a glass of water approximately at the 
same time each day. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water and should not be opened, 
broken, or chewed. IMBRUVICA must not be taken with grapefruit juice or Seville oranges (see 
section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort is contraindicated in patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Bleeding-related events
There have been reports of bleeding events in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include minor bleeding events such as contusion, epistaxis, and 
petechiae; and major bleeding events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial 
haemorrhage, and haematuria.
Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with 
IMBRUVICA.
4
Use of either anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet function (antiplatelet agents) 
concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major bleeding. A higher risk for major 
bleeding was observed with anticoagulant than with antiplatelet agents. Consider the risks and benefits 
of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs 
and symptoms of bleeding.
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.
IMBRUVICA should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of 
surgery and the risk of bleeding.
The mechanism for the bleeding-related events is not fully understood. Patients with congenital 
bleeding diathesis have not been studied.
Leukostasis
Cases of leukostasis have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. A high number of 
circulating lymphocytes (>400 000/mcL) may confer increased risk. Consider temporarily withholding 
IMBRUVICA. Patients should be closely monitored. Administer supportive care including hydration 
and/or cytoreduction as indicated.
Splenic rupture
Cases of splenic rupture have been reported following discontinuation of IMBRUVICA treatment. 
Disease status and spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound) 
when IMBRUVICA treatment is interrupted or ceased. Patients who develop left upper abdominal or 
shoulder tip pain should be evaluated and a diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered. 
Infections
Infections (including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalisation 
and death. Most patients with fatal infections also had neutropenia. Patients should be monitored for 
fever, abnormal liver function tests, neutropenia and infections and appropriate anti-infective therapy
should be instituted as indicated. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who 
are at increased risk for opportunistic infections.
Cases of invasive fungal infections, including cases of Aspergillosis, Cryptococcosis and 
Pneumocystis jiroveci infections have been reported following the use of ibrutinib. Reported cases of 
invasive fungal infections have been associated with fatal outcomes.
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported 
following the use of ibrutinib within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening 
neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected then appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment suspended until PML is excluded. If any 
doubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML including MRI 
scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat 
neurological assessments should be considered.
Hepatic events
Cases of hepatotoxicity, hepatitis B reactivation, and cases of hepatitis E, which may be chronic, have 
occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Hepatic failure, including fatal events, has occurred in 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Liver function and viral hepatitis status should be assessed before 
initiating treatment with IMBRUVICA. Patients should be periodically monitored for changes in liver 
function parameters during treatment. As clinically indicated, viral load and serological testing for 
infectious hepatitis should be performed per local medical guidelines. For patients diagnosed with 
hepatic events, consider consulting a liver disease expert for management.
5
Cytopenias
Treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) were 
reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
Cases of ILD have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for 
pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. If symptoms develop, interrupt IMBRUVICA and manage 
ILD appropriately. If symptoms persist, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and 
follow the dose modification guidelines.
Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure
Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have occurred in patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA. Patients with advanced age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status ≥2, or cardiac co-morbidities may be at greater risk of events including sudden 
fatal cardiac events. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure 
have been reported, particularly in patients with acute infections or cardiac risk factors including 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia. 
Appropriate clinical evaluation of cardiac history and function should be performed prior to initiating 
IMBRUVICA. Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment for signs of clinical 
deterioration of cardiac function and clinically managed. Consider further evaluation (e.g., ECG, 
echocardiogram), as indicated for patients in whom there are cardiovascular concerns.
For patients with relevant risk factors for cardiac events, carefully assess benefit/risk before initiating 
treatment with IMBRUVICA; alternative treatment may be considered.
In patients who develop signs and/or symptoms of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, IMBRUVICA should 
be temporarily discontinued and a thorough clinical benefit/risk assessment should be performed 
before possibly restarting therapy.
In patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy, alternative treatment 
options to IMBRUVICA should be considered. In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy 
with IMBRUVICA a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be 
undertaken. In patients at high risk and where alternatives to IMBRUVICA are non-suitable, tightly 
controlled treatment with anticoagulants should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure during IMBRUVICA
treatment. In some of these cases cardiac failure resolved or improved after IMBRUVICA withdrawal 
or dose reduction. 
Cerebrovascular accidents
Cases of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke including fatalities 
have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, with and without concomitant atrial 
fibrillation and/or hypertension. Among cases with reported latency, the initiation of treatment with 
IMBRUVICA to the onset of ischaemic central nervous vascular conditions was in the most cases 
after several months (more than 1 month in 78% and more than 6 months in 44% of cases) 
emphasising the need for regular monitoring of patients (please see section 4.4 Cardiac arrhythmia and 
Hypertension and section 4.8).
Tumour lysis syndrome
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Patients at risk of 
tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Monitor patients closely 
and take appropriate precautions.
6
Non-melanoma skin cancer
Non-melanoma skin cancers were reported more frequently in patients treated with IMBRUVICA than 
in patients treated with comparators in pooled comparative randomised phase 3 studies. Monitor 
patients for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer.
Hypertension
Hypertension has occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA (see section 4.8). Regularly monitor 
blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA and initiate or adjust antihypertensive medication 
throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate.
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
Cases of HLH (including fatal cases) have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. HLH 
is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterised by clinical signs and 
symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterised by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, 
hypertriglyceridaemia, high serum ferritin and cytopenias. Patients should be informed about 
symptoms of HLH. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should 
be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered.
Drug-drug interactions
Co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with IMBRUVICA may lead to increased 
ibrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased IMBRUVICA exposure and consequently a risk for lack of 
efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong or 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided whenever possible and co-administration should only 
be considered when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Patients should be 
closely monitored for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity if a CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.5). If a CYP3A4 inducer must be used, closely monitor patients for signs of 
IMBRUVICA lack of efficacy.
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking
IMBRUVICA (see section 4.6).
Excipients with known effect
Each capsule contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), and is essentially sodium-free.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Ibrutinib is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).
Agents that may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations
Concomitant use of IMBRUVICA and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit 
CYP3A4 can increase ibrutinib exposure and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
Co-administration of ketoconazole, a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, 
increased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. Simulations using 
fasted conditions suggested that the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin may increase the AUC of 
ibrutinib by a factor of 14. In patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, 
co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole increased Cmax by 6.7-fold and AUC 
by 5.7-fold. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, cobicistat, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose to 140 mg (one capsule) for the duration of the inhibitor 
use or withhold IMBRUVICA temporarily (for 7 days or less). Monitor patient closely for toxicity and 
follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
7
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors
In patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, co-administration of the 
CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin increased Cmax by 3.4-fold and AUC by 3.0-fold. If a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, 
crizotinib, diltiazem, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone and dronedarone) is indicated, 
reduce IMBRUVICA dose to 280 mg (two capsules) for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor 
patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Mild CYP3A4 inhibitors
Simulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A4 inhibitors azithromycin and
fluvoxamine may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by <2-fold. No dose adjustment is required in 
combination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification 
guidance as needed.
Co-administration of grapefruit juice, containing CYP3A4 inhibitors, in eight healthy subjects, 
increased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively. 
Grapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see section 4.2).
Agents that may decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations
Administration of IMBRUVICA with inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease ibrutinib plasma 
concentrations.
Co-administration of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, decreased 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 92 and 90%, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong 
or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin). Preparations containing 
St. John's Wort are contraindicated during treatment with IMBRUVICA, as efficacy may be reduced. 
Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A4 induction. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong
or moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be used, monitor patient closely for lack of efficacy (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). Mild inducers may be used concomitantly with IMBRUVICA, however, patients 
should be monitored for potential lack of efficacy.
Ibrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. A lower Cmax was observed 
in fasted healthy subjects administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 
40 mg once daily for 5 days (see section 5.2). There is no evidence that the lower Cmax would have 
clinical significance, and medicinal products that increase stomach pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) 
have been used without restrictions in the pivotal clinical studies.
Agents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by ibrutinib
Ibrutinib is a P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor in vitro. As no clinical data 
are available on this interaction, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp and 
BCRP after a therapeutic dose. To minimise the potential for an interaction in the GI tract, oral narrow 
therapeutic range, P-gp or BCRP substrates such as digoxin or methotrexate should be taken at least 
6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA. Ibrutinib may also inhibit BCRP in the liver and increase the 
exposure of medicinal products that undergo BCRP-mediated hepatic efflux, such as rosuvastatin.
In studies of ibrutinib (420 mg) in combination with venetoclax (400 mg) in CLL patients, an increase 
in venetoclax exposure (approximately 1.8-fold based on AUC) was observed compared with 
monotherapy data for venetoclax.
In a drug interaction study in patients with B-cell malignancies, a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib did 
not have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. In the 
same study, 2 weeks of treatment with ibrutinib at 560 mg daily had no clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel), the CYP3A4 substrate 
midazolam, nor the CYP2B6 substrate bupropion.

4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception in females
Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant 
women. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for up to 3 months 
after ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective 
contraceptive measures while taking IMBRUVICA and for three months after stopping treatment. 
Pregnancy
IMBRUVICA should not be used during pregnancy. There are no data from the use of IMBRUVICA
in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether ibrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed 
children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
IMBRUVICA.
Fertility
No effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the 
maximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose [HED] 16 mg/kg/day) (see 
section 5.3). No human data on the effects of ibrutinib on fertility are available.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
IMBRUVICA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Fatigue, dizziness and asthenia have been reported in some patients taking IMBRUVICA and should 
be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhoea, neutropenia, musculoskeletal 
pain, haemorrhage (e.g., bruising), rash, nausea, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia, and upper respiratory 
tract infection. The most common grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥5%) were neutropenia, 
lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and pneumonia.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety profile is based on pooled data from 1 981 patients treated with IMBRUVICA in four 
phase 2 clinical studies and eight randomised phase 3 studies and from post-marketing experience. 
Patients treated for MCL in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 560 mg once daily and patients 
treated for CLL or WM in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 420 mg once daily. All patients in 
clinical studies received IMBRUVICA until disease progression or no longer tolerated, except for 
studies with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax where patients received fixed duration 
treatment (Studies CLL3011 and PCYC-1142-CA). The median duration of IMBRUVICA treatment 
across the pooled dataset was 14.7 months. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 
14.7 months (up to 52 months); MCL was 11.7 months (up to 28 months); WM was 21.6 months (up 
to 37 months).
Adverse reactions in patients treated with ibrutinib for B-cell malignancies and post-marketing adverse 
reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are defined as 
follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Discontinuation and dose reduction due to adverse reactions
Of the 1 981 patients treated with IMBRUVICA for B-cell malignancies, 6% discontinued treatment 
primarily due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, rash, 
thrombocytopenia, and haemorrhage. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 
approximately 8% of patients.
Elderly
Of the 1 981 patients treated with IMBRUVICA, 50% were 65 years of age or older. Grade 3 or higher 
pneumonia (11% of patients age ≥65 versus 4% of patients <65 years) and thrombocytopenia (11% of 
patients age ≥65 years versus 5% of patients <65 years) occurred more frequently among elderly 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA.
Long-term safety
The safety data from long-term treatment with IMBRUVICA over 5 years from 1 284 patients 
(treatment-naïve CLL/SLL n=162, relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL n=646, relapsed/refractory MCL 
n=370, and WM n=106) were analysed. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 
51 months (range, 0.2 to 98 months) with 70% and 52% of patients receiving treatment for more than 
2 years and 4 years, respectively. The median duration of treatment for MCL was 11 months (range, 0 
to 87 months) with 31% and 17% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, 
respectively. The median duration of treatment for WM was 47 months (range, 0.3 to 61 months) with 
78% and 46% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, respectively. The 
overall known safety profile of IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained consistent, other than an 
increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety concerns identified. The prevalence for 
11
Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 7% (year 1-2), 9% (year 2-3), 9% (year 3-4), and 
9% (year 4-5); the overall incidence for the 5-year period was 11%.
Paediatric population
The safety assessment is based on data from a Phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with 
either a rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and dexamethasone (RICE) regimen, or a 
rituximab, vincristine, ifosfamide, carboplatin, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (RVICI) regimen, as 
background therapy or background therapy alone in paediatric and young adult patients (aged 3 to 
19 years) with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see section 5.1). No new 
adverse reactions were observed in this study.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There are limited data on the effects of IMBRUVICA overdose. No maximum tolerated dose was 
reached in the phase 1 study in which patients received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1 400 mg/day). In a 
separate study, one healthy subject who received a dose of 1 680 mg experienced reversible grade 4 
hepatic enzyme increases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)]. 
There is no specific antidote for IMBRUVICA. Patients who ingested more than the recommended 
dose should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EL01.
Mechanism of action
Ibrutinib is a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib forms a 
covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition 
of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signalling
molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. The BCR pathway is 
implicated in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies, including MCL, diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and CLL. BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through the 
B-cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis 
and adhesion. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B-cell 
proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.
In preclinical tumour models, the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax resulted in increased 
cellular apoptosis and anti-tumor activity compared to either agent alone. BTK inhibition by ibrutinib 
increases CLL cell dependence on BCL-2, a cell survival pathway, while venetoclax inhibits BCL-2 
leading to apoptosis. 
Lymphocytosis
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (i.e., ≥50% increase from 
baseline and an absolute count >5 000/mcL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, has 
been observed in about three fourths of patients with CLL treated with IMBRUVICA. This effect has 
also been observed in about one third of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL treated with 
IMBRUVICA. This observed lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be 
considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings. In both disease types, 
lymphocytosis typically occurs during the first month of IMBRUVICA therapy and typically resolves 
12
within a median of 8.0 weeks in patients with MCL and 14 weeks in patients with CLL. A large 
increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes (e.g., >400 000/mcL) has been observed in some 
patients.
Lymphocytosis was not observed in patients with WM treated with IMBRUVICA.
In vitro platelet aggregation
In an in vitro study, ibrutinib demonstrated inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. 
Ibrutinib did not show meaningful inhibition of platelet aggregation using other agonists of platelet 
aggregation.
Effect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology
The effect of ibrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 20 healthy male and female subjects in a 
randomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic 
dose of 1 680 mg, ibrutinib did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. The 
largest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the baseline adjusted mean differences between 
ibrutinib and placebo was below 10 ms. In this same study, a concentration dependent shortening in 
the QTc interval was observed (-5.3 ms [90% CI: -9.4, -1.1] at a Cmax of 719 ng/mL following the 
supratherapeutic dose of 1 680 mg).
Clinical efficacy and safety
MCL
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were evaluated 
in a single open-label, multi-center phase 2 study (PCYC-1104-CA) of 111 patients. The median age 
was 68 years (range: 40 to 84 years), 77% were male and 92% were Caucasian. Patients with ECOG 
performance status of 3 or greater were excluded from the study. The median time since diagnosis was 
42 months, and median number of prior treatments was 3 (range: 1 to 5 treatments), including 35% 
with prior high-dose chemotherapy, 43% with prior bortezomib, 24% with prior lenalidomide, and 
11% with prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. At baseline, 39% of patients had bulky 
disease (≥5 cm), 49% had high-risk score by Simplified MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI), 
and 72% had advanced disease (extranodal and/or bone marrow involvement) at screening.
IMBRUVICA was administered orally at 560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Tumour response was assessed according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) 
for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. The primary endpoint in this study was 
investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR). Responses to IMBRUVICA are shown in Table 2.

The efficacy data was further evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating an 
ORR of 69%, with a 21% complete response (CR) rate and a 48% partial response (PR) rate. The IRC 
estimated median DOR was 19.6 months.
The overall response to IMBRUVICA was independent of prior treatment including bortezomib and 
lenalidomide or underlying risk/prognostic factors, bulky disease, gender or age.
13
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA were demonstrated in a randomised phase 3, open-label, 
multicenter study including 280 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy (Study 
MCL3001). Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA orally at 560 mg once daily 
for 21 days or temsirolimus intravenously at 175 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of the first cycle followed by 
75 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Treatment on both arms continued until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years (range, 34; 88 years), 74% 
were male and 87% were Caucasian. The median time since diagnosis was 43 months, and median 
number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 9 treatments), including 51% with prior high-dose 
chemotherapy, 18% with prior bortezomib, 5% with prior lenalidomide, and 24% with prior stem cell 
transplant. At baseline, 53% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 21% had high-risk score by 
Simplified MIPI, 60% had extranodal disease and 54% had bone marrow involvement at screening.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to the revised International Working 
Group (IWG) for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. Efficacy results for Study MCL3001 are 
shown in Table 3 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS in Figure 1.

Single agent
A randomised, multicenter, open-label phase 3 study (PCYC-1115-CA) of IMBRUVICA versus 
chlorambucil was conducted in patients with treatment-naïve CLL who were 65 years of age or older. 
Patients between 65 and 70 years of age were required to have at least one comorbidity that precluded 
the use of frontline chemo-immunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. 
Patients (n=269) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity, or chlorambucil at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 
of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles, with an allowance for intrapatient dose increases up 
to 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerability. After confirmed disease progression, patients on chlorambucil were 
able to crossover to ibrutinib.
The median age was 73 years (range, 65 to 90 years), 63% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. 
Ninety one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 9% had an 
ECOG performance status of 2. The study enrolled 269 patients with CLL. At baseline, 45% had 
advanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 35% of patients had at least one tumor ≥5 cm, 39% with 
baseline anaemia, 23% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 65% had elevated β2 microglobulin 
>3 500 mcg/L, 47% had a CrCL <60 mL/min, 20% of patients presented with del11q, 6% of patients 
presented with del17p/tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation, and 44% of patients presented with 
unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV).
Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC according to International Workshop on CLL
(IWCLL) criteria indicated an 84% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression 
15
in the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1115-CA are shown in Table 4 and the 
Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
There was a statistically significant sustained platelet or haemoglobin improvement in the ITT 
population in favor of ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In patients with baseline cytopenias, sustained 
haematologic improvement was: platelets 77.1% versus 42.9%; haemoglobin 84.3% versus 45.5% for 
ibrutinib and chlorambucil, respectively.

48-month follow-up 
With a median follow-up time on study of 48 months in Study PCYC-1115-CA and its extension 
study, an 86% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed 
for patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS was not reached in the 
IMBRUVICA arm and was 15 months [95% CI (10.22, 19.35)] in the chlorambucil arm; (HR=0.14 
[95% CI (0.09, 0.21)]). The 4-year PFS estimate was 73.9% in the IMBRUVICA arm and 15.5% in 
the chlorambucil arm, respectively. The updated Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 4. 
The investigator-assessed ORR was 91.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 36.8% in the chlorambucil 
arm. The CR rate according to IWCLL criteria was 16.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 3.0% in the 
chlorambucil arm. At the time of long-term follow-up, a total of 73 subjects (54.9%) originally 
randomised to the chlorambucil arm subsequently received ibrutinib as cross-over treatment. The 
Kaplan-Meier landmark estimate for OS at 48-months was 85.5% in the IMBRUVICA arm.
The treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1115-CA was consistent across high-risk patients 
with del17p/TP53 mutation, del11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.

Combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL were further 
evaluated in a randomised, multi-center, open-label, phase 3 study (PCYC-1130-CA) of IMBRUVICA 
in combination with obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. The study 
enrolled patients who were 65 years of age or older or <65 years of age with coexisting medical 
conditions, reduced renal function as measured by creatinine clearance <70 mL/min, or presence of 
del17p/TP53 mutation. Patients (n=229) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg 
daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or chlorambucil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on 
Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. In both arms, patients received 1 000 mg of 
obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8 and 15 of the first cycle, followed by treatment on the first day of 
5 subsequent cycles (total of 6 cycles, 28 days each). The first dose of obinutuzumab was divided 
between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg). 
The median age was 71 years (range, 40 to 87 years), 64% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (48%) or 1-2 (52%). At baseline, 52% had 
advanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 32% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 44% with 
baseline anaemia, 22% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 28% had a CrCL <60 mL/min, and the 
median Cumulative Illness Rating Score for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) was 4 (range, 0 to 12). At baseline, 
65% of patients presented with CLL/SLL with high risk factors (del17p/TP53 mutation [18%], del11q 
[15%], or unmutated IGHV [54%]). 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 77% 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression in the IMBRUVICA arm. With a 
median follow-up time on study of 31 months, the median PFS was not reached in the 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab arm and was 19 months in the chlorambucil+obinutuzumab arm. 
Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1130-CA are shown in Table 5 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS 
is shown in Figure 5.

Any grade infusion-related reactions were observed in 25% of patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 58% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab. Grade 3
or higher or serious infusion-related reactions were observed in 3% of patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 9% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab.
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL or SLL were 
further evaluated in a randomised, multi-center, open-label, phase 3 study (E1912) of IMBRUVICA in 
combination with rituximab (IR) versus standard fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) 
chemo-immunotherapy. The study enrolled previously untreated patients with CLL or SLL who were 
70 years or younger. Patients with del17p were excluded from the study. Patients (n=529) were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either IR or FCR. IMBRUVICA was administered at a dose of 420 mg daily 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Fludarabine was administered at a dose of 
25 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide was administered at a dose of 250 mg/m2, both on Days 1, 2, and 3 
of Cycles 1-6. Rituximab was initiated in Cycle 2 for the IR arm and in Cycle 1 for the FCR arm and 
was administered at a dose of 50 mg/m2 on Day 1 of the first cycle, 325 mg/m2 on Day 2 of the first 
cycle, and 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of 5 subsequent cycles, for a total of 6 cycles. Each cycle was 28 days.
The median age was 58 years (range, 28 to 70 years), 67% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (98%) or 2 (2%). At baseline, 43% of 
patients presented with Rai Stage III or IV, and 59% of patients presented with CLL/SLL with high 
risk factors (TP53 mutation [6%], del11q [22%], or unmutated IGHV [53%]).
With a median follow-up time on study of 37 months, efficacy results for E1912 are shown in Table 7. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS, assessed according to IWCLL criteria, and OS are shown in

Fixed duration combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of fixed duration therapy with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax
versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated CLL
were evaluated in a randomised, open-label, phase 3 (CLL3011) study. The study enrolled patients 
with previously untreated CLL who were 65 years or older, and adult patients <65 years of age with a 
CIRS score >6 or CrCL ≥30 to <70 mL/min. Patients with del 17p or known TP53 mutations were 
excluded. Patients (n=211) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA in combination with 
22
venetoclax or chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the IMBRUVICA plus
venetoclax arm received single agent IMBRUVICA for 3 cycles followed by IMBRUVICA in 
combination with venetoclax for 12 cycles (including 5-week dose-titration schedule). Each cycle was 
28 days. IMBRUVICA was administered at a dose of 420 mg daily. Venetoclax was administered 
daily, starting with 20 mg for 1 week, followed by 1 week at each dose level of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 
200 mg, then the recommended daily dose of 400 mg. Patients randomised to the chlorambucil plus
obinutuzumab arm received treatment for 6 cycles. Obinutuzumab was administered at a dose of 
1 000 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 in Cycle 1. In Cycles 2 to 6, 1 000 mg obinutuzumab was given on 
Day 1. Chlorambucil was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight on Days 1 and 15 of 
Cycles 1 to 6. Patients with confirmed progression by IWCLL criteria after completion of either fixed 
duration regimen could be treated with single-agent IMBRUVICA. 
The median age was 71 years (range, 47 to 93 years), 58% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (35%), 1 (53%), or 2 (12%). At baseline, 18% 
of patients presented with CLL with del 11q and 52% with unmutated IGHV.
At baseline assessment for risk of tumor lysis syndrome, 25% of patients had high tumor burden. After 
3 cycles of single-agent IMBRUVICA lead-in therapy, 2% of patients had high tumor burden. High 
tumor burden was defined as any lymph node ≥10 cm; or any lymph node ≥5 cm and absolute 
lymphocyte count ≥25×109/L.
With a median follow-up time on study of 28 months, efficacy results for Study CLL3011 assessed by 
an IRC according to IWCLL criteria are shown in Table 9, the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown 
in Figure 8, and rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity are shown in Table 10.

CLL in Study CLL3011
The treatment effect of IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax was consistent across the high-risk CLL 
population (TP53 mutation, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV), with a PFS HR of 0.23 [95% 
CI (0.13, 0.41)].
Overall survival data were not mature. With a median follow-up of 28 months, there was no 
significant difference between treatment arms with a total of 23 deaths: 11 (10.4%) in the 
IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax arm and 12 (11.4%) in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab arm with a 
OS HR of 1.048 [95% CI (0.454, 2.419)]. After 6 months additional follow-up, 11 (10.4%) and 16 
(15.2%) deaths were reported in the IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax arm and the chlorambucil plus
obinutuzumab arm, respectively with OS HR estimated at 0.760 [95% CI (0.352, 1.642]).

IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax and, at the corresponding time point, was 12.4% (13/105) by NGS 
assay and 16.2% (17/105) by flow cytometry in patients treated with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab.
TLS was reported in 6 patients treated with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab and no TLS was reported 
in IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax.
Overall follow-up of 58 months (median of 52 months)
With an overall follow-up of 58 months (median follow-up time on study of 52 months) in Study 
CLL3011, a 77% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was 
observed for patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The overall survival hazard ratio was 0.458 [95% CI 
(0.257, 0.818), nominal p=0.0068, not type 1 error controlled]. There were 17 (16.0%) deaths in the 
IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax arm and 36 (34.3%) in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab arm. 
Median time to next treatment was not reached for either arm (HR=0.164; 95% CI: 0.081, 0.330) with 
9.4% of subjects in the IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax arm and 41.0% of subjects in the chlorambucil 
plus obinutuzumab arm having initiated subsequent anticancer therapy.

The safety and efficacy of fixed duration therapy with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax
in patients with previously untreated CLL were further evaluated in a cohort of the phase 2, 
multi-center, 2-cohort study (PCYC-1142-CA). The study enrolled previously untreated patients with 
CLL who were 70 years or younger. The study enrolled 323 patients, of these, 159 patients were 
enrolled to fixed duration therapy consisting of 3 cycles of single agent IMBRUVICA followed by 
IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax for 12 cycles (including 5-week dose titration 
schedule). Each cycle was 28 days. IMBRUVICA was administered at a dose of 420 mg daily. 
Venetoclax was administered daily, starting with 20 mg for 1 week, followed by 1 week at each dose 
level of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, then the recommended daily dose of 400 mg. Patients with 
confirmed progression by IWCLL criteria after completion of the fixed duration regimen could be 
retreated with single-agent IMBRUVICA.
The median age was 60 years (range, 33 to 71 years), 67% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (69%) or 1 (31%). At baseline, 13% of patients 
had del 17p, 18% with del 11q, 17% with del 17p/TP53 mutation, 56% with unmutated IGHV and 
19% with complex karyotype. At baseline assessment for risk of tumor lysis syndrome, 21% of 
patients had high tumor burden. 
26
After 3 cycles of single-agent IMBRUVICA lead-in therapy, 1% of patients had high tumor burden. 
High tumor burden was defined as any lymph node ≥10 cm, or any lymph node ≥5 cm and absolute 
lymphocyte count ≥25×109/L.

Patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy
Single agent
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with CLL were demonstrated in one uncontrolled 
study and one randomised, controlled study. The open-label, multi-center study (PCYC-1102-CA) 
included 51 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, who received 420 mg once daily. IMBRUVICA
was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years 
(range: 37 to 82 years), median time since diagnosis was 80 months, and median number of prior 
treatments was 4 (range: 1 to 12 treatments), including 92.2% with a prior nucleoside analog, 98.0% 
with prior rituximab, 86.3% with a prior alkylator, 39.2% with prior bendamustine and 19.6% with 
prior ofatumumab. At baseline, 39.2% of patients had Rai Stage IV, 45.1% had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 
35.3% had deletion 17p and 31.4% had deletion 11q.
ORR was assessed according to the 2008 IWCLL criteria by investigators and IRC. At a median 
duration follow-up of 16.4 months, the ORR by IRC for the 51 relapsed or refractory patients was 
64.7% (95% CI: 50.1%; 77.6%), all PRs. The ORR including PR with lymphocytosis was 70.6%.
Median time to response was 1.9 months. The DOR ranged from 3.9 to 24.2+ months. The median 
DOR was not reached.
A randomised, multi-center, open-label phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA versus ofatumumab 
(PCYC-1112-CA) was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Patients (n=391) were 
randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, or ofatumumab for up to 12 doses (300/2 000 mg). Fifty-seven patients randomised to 
ofatumumab crossed over following progression to receive IMBRUVICA. The median age was 
67 years (range: 30 to 88 years), 68% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 91 months and the median 
number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 13 treatments). At baseline, 58% of patients had at least 
one tumour ≥5 cm. Thirty-two percent of patients had deletion 17p (with 50% of patients having 
deletion 17p/TP53 mutation), 24% had 11q deletion, and 47% of patients had unmutated IGHV.
Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by an IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 78% 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression for patients in the IMBRUVICA 
arm. Analysis of OS demonstrated a 57% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death for 
patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1112-CA are shown in Table 13.

Final Analysis at 65-month follow-up
With a median follow-up time on study of 65 months in Study PCYC-1112-CA, an 85% reduction in 
the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed for patients in the 
IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS according to IWCLL criteria was 
44.1 months [95% CI (38.47, 56.18)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 8.1 months [95% CI (7.79, 8.25)] 
in the ofatumumab arm, respectively; HR=0.15 [95% CI (0.11, 0.20)]. The updated Kaplan-Meier 
curve for PFS is shown in Figure 11. The investigator-assessed ORR in the IMBRUVICA arm was 
87.7% versus 22.4% in the ofatumumab arm. At the time of final analysis, 133 (67.9%) of the 
196 subjects originally randomised to the ofatumumab treatment arm had crossed over to ibrutinib 
treatment. The median investigator-assessed PFS2 (time from randomisation until PFS event after first 
subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy) according to IWCLL criteria was 65.4 months [95% CI (51.61, not 
estimable)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 38.5 months [95% CI (19.98, 47.24)] in the ofatumumab 
29
arm, respectively; HR=0.54 [95% CI (0.41, 0.71)]. The median OS was 67.7 months [95% CI (61.0, 
not estimable)] in the IMBRUVICA arm.
The treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1112-CA was consistent across high-risk patients 
with deletion 17p/TP53 mutation, deletion 11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.

Combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients previously treated for CLL were further evaluated 
in a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with BR 
versus placebo+BR (Study CLL3001). Patients (n=578) were randomised 1:1 to receive either 
IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily or placebo in combination with BR until disease progression, or 
unacceptable toxicity. All patients received BR for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Bendamustine 
was dosed at 70 mg/m2 infused IV over 30 minutes on Cycle 1, Days 2 and 3, and on Cycles 2-6, 
Days 1 and 2 for up to 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in the first cycle, 
Day 1, and 500 mg/m2 Cycles 2 through 6, Day 1. Ninety patients randomised to placebo+BR crossed 
over to receive IMBRUVICA following IRC confirmed progression. The median age was 64 years 
(range, 31 to 86 years), 66% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 6 years and the median number of 
prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, 56% of patients had at least one tumour 
≥5 cm, 26% had del11q.
Progression free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria. Efficacy results for 
Study CLL3001 are shown in Table 15.

WM
Single agent
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM (IgM-excreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) were
evaluated in an open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial of 63 previously treated patients. The median 
age was 63 years (range: 44 to 86 years), 76% were male, and 95% were Caucasian. All patients had a 
baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 74 months, and the 
median number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, the median serum 
IgM value was 3.5 g/dL, and 60% of patients were anaemic (haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL or 6.8 mmol/L).
IMBRUVICA was administered orally at 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. The primary endpoint in this study was ORR per investigator assessment. The ORR and DOR 
were assessed using criteria adopted from the Third International Workshop of WM. Responses to 
IMBRUVICA are shown in Table 16.

The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM were further evaluated in patients with 
treatment-naïve or previously treated WM in a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study 
of IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab versus placebo in combination with rituximab 
(PCYC-1127-CA). Patients (n=150) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg 
daily or placebo in combination with rituximab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Rituximab was administered weekly at a dose of 375 mg/m2 for 4 consecutive weeks (weeks 1-4) 
followed by a second course of weekly rituximab for 4 consecutive weeks (weeks 17-20).
The median age was 69 years (range, 36 to 89 years), 66% were male, and 79% were Caucasian. 
Ninety-three percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 7% of patients 
had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-five percent of patients were treatment-naïve, and 
55% of patients were previously treated. The median time since diagnosis was 52.6 months 
31
(treatment-naïve patients=6.5 months and previously treated patients=94.3 months). Among 
previously treated patients, the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 6 treatments). 
At baseline, the median serum IgM value was 3.2 g/dL (range, 0.6 to 8.3 g/dL), 63% of patients were 
anaemic (haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL or 6.8 mmol/L) and MYD88 L265P mutations were present in 77% 
of patients, absent in 13% of patients, and 9% of patients were not evaluable for mutation status.
At the primary analysis, with a median follow-up of 26.5 months, the IRC-assessed PFS hazard ratio
was 0.20 [95% CI (0.11, 0.38)]. PFS hazard ratios for treatment-naïve patients, previously treated 
patients, and patients with or without MYD88 L265P mutations were consistent with the PFS hazard 
ratio for the ITT population.
Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions were observed in 1% of patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA+rituximab and 16% of patients treated with placebo+rituximab.
Tumor flare in the form of IgM increase occurred in 8.0% of subjects in the IMBRUVICA+rituximab 
arm and 46.7% of subjects in the placebo+rituximab arm.
Final Analysis at 63-month follow-up
With an overall follow-up of 63 months, efficacy results as assessed by an IRC at the time of the final 
analysis for PCYC-1127-CA are shown in Table 17 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in 
Figure 12. PFS hazard ratios for treatment-naïve patients (0.31 [95% CI (0.14, 0.69)]) and previously 
treated patients (0.22 [95% CI (0.11, 0.43)]) were consistent with the PFS hazard ratio for the ITT 
population.

Figure 12: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1127-CA (Final 
Analysis)
Study PCYC-1127-CA had a separate monotherapy arm of 31 patients with previously treated WM 
who failed prior rituximab-containing therapy and received single agent IMBRUVICA. The median 
age was 67 years (range, 47 to 90 years). Eighty-one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1, and 19% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. The median 
number of prior treatments was 4 (range, 1 to 7 treatments). With an overall follow-up of 61 months, 
the response rate observed in Study PCYC-1127-CA monotherapy arm per IRC assessment was 77% 
(0% CR, 29% VGPR, 48% PR). The median duration of response was 33 months (range, 2.4 to 60.2+ 
months). The overall response rate per IRC observed in the monotherapy arm was 87% (0% CR, 29% 
VGPR, 48% PR, 10% MR). The median duration of overall response was 39 months (range, 2.07 to 
60.2+ months).
Paediatric population
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of IMBRUVICA in paediatric and young adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were evaluated in a two-part, multi-
centre, open-label Phase 3 study (LYM3003) of IMBRUVICA in combination with either a rituximab, 
ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide and dexamethasone (RICE) regimen or a rituximab, vincristine, 
ifosfamide, carboplatin, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (RVICI) regimen, as background therapy. 
Part 1 of the study (21 patients aged 3 to 17 years) evaluated the dose to be used in part 2 (51 patients 
aged 3 to 19 years) (see section 5.2).
In part 2, patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA as 440 mg/m2 daily (age 
below 12 years) or 329 mg/m2 (age 12 years and older) with background therapy, or background 
therapy alone until completion of 3 cycles of therapy, transplantation, disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) superiority was not met 
suggesting no additional benefit from adding ibrutinib to RICE or RVICI (see section 4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Ibrutinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hours. Absolute 
bioavailability in fasted condition (n=8) was 2.9% (90% CI=2.1 – 3.9) and doubled when combined 
34
with a meal. Pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib does not significantly differ in patients with different B-cell 
malignancies. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The steady state AUC observed 
in patients at 560 mg is (mean ± standard deviation) 953 ± 705 ng h/mL. Administration of ibrutinib in 
fasted condition resulted in approximately 60% of exposure (AUClast) as compared to either 
30 minutes before, 30 minutes after (fed condition) or 2 hours after a high fat breakfast.
Ibrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In fasted healthy subjects 
administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, 
compared to ibrutinib alone, geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 83% (68-102%), 92% (78-110%), 
and 38% (26-53%) for AUC0-24, AUClast, and Cmax, respectively.
Distribution
Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration 
dependence in the range of 50 to 1 000 ng/mL. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vd, ss/F) was approximately 10 000 L.
Metabolism
Ibrutinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 to produce a dihydrodiol metabolite with an inhibitory 
activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib. Involvement of CYP2D6 in
the metabolism of ibrutinib appears to be minimal.
Therefore, no precautions are necessary in patients with different CYP2D6 genotypes.
Elimination
Apparent clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1 000 L/h. The half-life of ibrutinib is 4 to 13 hours.
After a single oral administration of radiolabeled [14C]-ibrutinib in healthy subjects, approximately 
90% of radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours, with the majority (80%) excreted in the faeces 
and <10% accounted for in urine. Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for approximately 1% of the 
radiolabeled excretion product in faeces and none in urine.
Special populations
Elderly
Population pharmacokinetics indicated that age does not significantly influence ibrutinib clearance 
from the circulation.
Paediatric population
Pharmacokinetic data show that ibrutinib exposures in children with relapsed or refractory mature B-
cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, aged 12 years and older receiving a daily dose of 329 mg/m2 and those 
aged 3 years to below 12 years receiving a daily dose of 440 mg/m2, were generally within the range 
of exposures observed in adult patients administered a daily dose of 560 mg.
Gender
Population pharmacokinetics data indicated that gender does not significantly influence ibrutinib 
clearance from the circulation.
Race
There are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics.
Body weight
Population pharmacokinetics data indicated that body weight (range: 41-146 kg; mean [SD]: 
83 [19 kg]) had a negligible effect on ibrutinib clearance.
Renal impairment
Ibrutinib has minimal renal clearance; urinary excretion of metabolites is <10% of the dose. No 
specific studies have been conducted to date in subjects with impaired renal function. There are no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2).
35
Hepatic impairment
Ibrutinib is metabolised in the liver. A hepatic impairment trial was performed in non-cancer subjects 
administered a single dose of 140 mg of medicinal product under fasting conditions. The effect of 
impaired liver function varied substantially between individuals, but on average a 2.7-, 8.2-, and 
9.8-fold increase in ibrutinib exposure (AUClast) was observed in subjects with mild (n=6, Child-Pugh
class A), moderate (n=10, Child-Pugh class B) and severe (n=8, Child-Pugh class C) hepatic 
impairment, respectively. The free fraction of ibrutinib also increased with degree of impairment, with 
3.0, 3.8 and 4.8% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver impairment, respectively, compared 
to 3.3% in plasma from matched healthy controls within this study. The corresponding increase in 
unbound ibrutinib exposure (AUCunbound, last) is estimated to be 4.1-, 9.8-, and 13-fold in subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see section 4.2).
Co-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-gp, nor other major transporters, except 
OCT2. The dihydrodiol metabolite and other metabolites are P-gp substrates. Ibrutinib is an in vitro
inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP (see section 4.5).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
The following adverse effects were seen in studies of 13-weeks duration in rats and dogs. Ibrutinib 
was found to induce gastrointestinal effects (soft faeces/diarrhoea and/or inflammation) and lymphoid 
depletion in rats and dogs with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day in 
both species. Based on mean exposure (AUC) at the 560 mg/day clinical dose, AUC ratios were 
2.6 and 21 at the NOAEL in male and female rats, and 0.4 and 1.8 at the NOAEL in male and female 
dogs, respectively. Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOEL) (60 mg/kg/day) margins in the dog are 
3.6-fold (males) and 2.3-fold (females). In rats, moderate pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (considered 
adverse) was observed at doses of ≥100 mg/kg in male rats (AUC exposure margin of 2.6-fold) and 
not observed in females at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 21.3-fold). Mildly 
decreased trabecular and cortical bone was seen in female rats administered ≥100 mg/kg/day (AUC 
exposure margin of 20.3-fold). All gastrointestinal, lymphoid and bone findings recovered following 
recovery periods of 6-13 weeks. Pancreatic findings partially recovered during comparable reversal 
periods.
Juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted.
Carcinogenicity/genotoxicity
Ibrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse at oral doses up 
to 2 000 mg/kg/day with an exposure margin of approximately 23 (males) to 37 (females) times the 
human AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily.
Ibrutinib has no genotoxic properties when tested in bacteria, mammalian cells or in mice.
Reproductive toxicity
In pregnant rats, ibrutinib at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day was associated with increased post-implantation 
loss and increased visceral (heart and major vessels) malformations and skeletal variations with an 
exposure margin 14 times the AUC found in patients at a daily dose of 560 mg. At a dose of 
≥40 mg/kg/day, ibrutinib was associated with decreased foetal weights (AUC ratio of ≥5.6 as 
compared to daily dose of 560 mg in patients). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 1.3 times the AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).
In pregnant rabbits, ibrutinib at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day or greater was associated with skeletal 
malformations (fused sternebrae) and ibrutinib at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day was associated with 
increased post-implantation loss. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rabbits at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 2.0 times the exposure (AUC) in patients with MCL administered ibrutinib 560 mg 
daily and 2.8 times the exposure in patients with CLL or WM receiving ibrutinib dose 420 mg per 
day). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the AUC of 
ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).
36
Fertility
No effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the 
maximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (HED 16 mg/kg/day).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab or venetoclax is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) (see section 5.1).
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for 
patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with this medicinal product should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced 
in the use of anticancer medicinal products.
Posology
MCL
The recommended dose for the treatment of MCL is 560 mg once daily.
CLL and WM
The recommended dose for the treatment of CLL and WM, either as a single agent or in combination, 
is 420 mg once daily (for details of the combination regimens, see section 5.1).
Treatment with IMBRUVICA should continue until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the 
patient. In combination with venetoclax for the treatment of CLL, IMBRUVICA should be 
administered as a single agent for 3 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days), followed by 12 cycles of 
IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax. See the venetoclax Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for 
full venetoclax dosing information.
When administering IMBRUVICA in combination with anti-CD20 therapy, it is recommended to 
administer IMBRUVICA prior to anti-CD20 therapy when given on the same day.
Dose adjustments
Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of ibrutinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
The dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 280 mg once daily when used concomitantly with moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors.
The dose of ibrutinib should be reduced to 140 mg once daily or withheld for up to 7 days when it is 
used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
IMBRUVICA therapy should be withheld for any new onset or worsening grade 2 cardiac failure, 
grade 3 cardiac arrhythmias, grade ≥3 non-haematological toxicity, grade 3 or greater neutropenia with 
infection or fever, or grade 4 haematological toxicities. Once the symptoms of the toxicity have 
resolved to grade 1 or baseline (recovery), resume IMBRUVICA therapy at the recommended dose as 
per the tables below.

Missed dose
If a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a 
return to the normal schedule the following day. The patient should not take extra tablets to make up 
the missed dose.
Special populations
Elderly
No specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥65 years).
Renal impairment
No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment were treated in IMBRUVICA clinical studies. No dose adjustment is 
needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine 
clearance). Hydration should be maintained and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. 
Administer IMBRUVICA to patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min creatinine clearance) 
only if the benefit outweighs the risk and monitor patients closely for signs of toxicity. There are no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).
41
Hepatic impairment
Ibrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In a hepatic impairment study, data showed an increase in 
ibrutinib exposure (see section 5.2). For patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh class A), the 
recommended dose is 280 mg daily. For patients with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh 
class B), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily. Monitor patients for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity 
and follow dose modification guidance as needed. It is not recommended to administer IMBRUVICA 
to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
Severe cardiac disease
Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from IMBRUVICA clinical studies.
Paediatric population
IMBRUVICA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years as efficacy 
has not been established. Currently available data in patients with mature B-cell non-Hodgkin
lymphoma are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.
Method of administration
IMBRUVICA should be administered orally once daily with a glass of water approximately at the 
same time each day. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and should not be broken or 
chewed. IMBRUVICA must not be taken with grapefruit juice or Seville oranges (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort is contraindicated in patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Bleeding-related events
There have been reports of bleeding events in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include minor bleeding events such as contusion, epistaxis, and 
petechiae; and major bleeding events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial 
haemorrhage, and haematuria.
Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with 
IMBRUVICA.
Use of either anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet function (antiplatelet agents) 
concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major bleeding. A higher risk for major 
bleeding was observed with anticoagulant than with antiplatelet agents. Consider the risks and benefits 
of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs 
and symptoms of bleeding.
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.
IMBRUVICA should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of 
surgery and the risk of bleeding.
The mechanism for the bleeding-related events is not fully understood. Patients with congenital 
bleeding diathesis have not been studied.
Leukostasis
Cases of leukostasis have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. A high number of 
circulating lymphocytes (>400 000/mcL) may confer increased risk. Consider temporarily withholding 
42
IMBRUVICA. Patients should be closely monitored. Administer supportive care including hydration 
and/or cytoreduction as indicated.
Splenic rupture
Cases of splenic rupture have been reported following discontinuation of IMBRUVICA treatment. 
Disease status and spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound) 
when IMBRUVICA treatment is interrupted or ceased. Patients who develop left upper abdominal or 
shoulder tip pain should be evaluated and a diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered.
Infections
Infections (including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalisation 
and death. Most patients with fatal infections also had neutropenia. Patients should be monitored for 
fever, abnormal liver function tests, neutropenia and infections and appropriate anti-infective therapy 
should be instituted as indicated. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who 
are at increased risk for opportunistic infections.
Cases of invasive fungal infections, including cases of Aspergillosis, Cryptococcosis and 
Pneumocystis jiroveci infections have been reported following the use of ibrutinib. Reported cases of 
invasive fungal infections have been associated with fatal outcomes.
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported 
following the use of ibrutinib within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening 
neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected then appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment suspended until PML is excluded. If any 
doubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML including MRI 
scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat 
neurological assessments should be considered.
Hepatic events
Cases of hepatotoxicity, hepatitis B reactivation, and cases of hepatitis E, which may be chronic, have 
occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Hepatic failure, including fatal events, has occurred in 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Liver function and viral hepatitis status should be assessed before 
initiating treatment with IMBRUVICA. Patients should be periodically monitored for changes in liver 
function parameters during treatment. As clinically indicated, viral load and serological testing for 
infectious hepatitis should be performed per local medical guidelines. For patients diagnosed with 
hepatic events, consider consulting a liver disease expert for management.
Cytopenias
Treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) were 
reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
Cases of ILD have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for 
pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. If symptoms develop, interrupt IMBRUVICA and manage 
ILD appropriately. If symptoms persist, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and 
follow the dose modification guidelines.
Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure 
Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have occurred in patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA. Patients with advanced age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status ≥2, or cardiac co-morbidities may be at greater risk of events including sudden 
fatal cardiac events. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure 
have been reported, particularly in patients with acute infections or cardiac risk factors including 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia. 
43
Appropriate clinical evaluation of cardiac history and function should be performed prior to initiating 
IMBRUVICA. Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment for signs of clinical 
deterioration of cardiac function and clinically managed. Consider further evaluation (e.g., ECG, 
echocardiogram), as indicated for patients in whom there are cardiovascular concerns.
For patients with relevant risk factors for cardiac events, carefully assess benefit/risk before initiating 
treatment with IMBRUVICA; alternative treatment may be considered.
In patients who develop signs and/or symptoms of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, IMBRUVICA should 
be temporarily discontinued and a thorough clinical benefit/risk assessment should be performed 
before possibly restarting therapy.
In patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy, alternative treatment 
options to IMBRUVICA should be considered. In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy 
with IMBRUVICA a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be 
undertaken. In patients at high risk and where alternatives to IMBRUVICA are non-suitable, tightly 
controlled treatment with anticoagulants should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure during IMBRUVICA 
treatment. In some of these cases cardiac failure resolved or improved after IMBRUVICA withdrawal 
or dose reduction. 
Cerebrovascular accidents
Cases of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke including fatalities 
have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, with and without concomitant atrial 
fibrillation and/or hypertension. Among cases with reported latency, the initiation of treatment with 
IMBRUVICA to the onset of ischaemic central nervous vascular conditions was in the most cases 
after several months (more than 1 month in 78% and more than 6 months in 44% of cases) 
emphasising the need for regular monitoring of patients (please see section 4.4 Cardiac arrhythmia and 
Hypertension and section 4.8).
Tumour lysis syndrome
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Patients at risk of 
tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Monitor patients closely 
and take appropriate precautions.
Non-melanoma skin cancer
Non-melanoma skin cancers were reported more frequently in patients treated with IMBRUVICA than
in patients treated with comparators in pooled comparative randomised phase 3 studies. Monitor 
patients for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer.
Hypertension
Hypertension has occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA (see section 4.8). Regularly monitor 
blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA and initiate or adjust antihypertensive medication 
throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate.
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
Cases of HLH (including fatal cases) have been reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. HLH 
is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterised by clinical signs and 
symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterised by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, 
hypertriglyceridaemia, high serum ferritin and cytopenias. Patients should be informed about 
symptoms of HLH. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should 
be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered.
Drug-drug interactions
Co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with IMBRUVICA may lead to increased 
ibrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of 
44
CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased IMBRUVICA exposure and consequently a risk for lack of 
efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong or 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided whenever possible and co-administration should only 
be considered when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Patients should be 
closely monitored for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity if a CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.5). If a CYP3A4 inducer must be used, closely monitor patients for signs of 
IMBRUVICA lack of efficacy.
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking 
IMBRUVICA (see section 4.6).
Excipients with known effect
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Each film-coated tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), and is essentially sodium-free.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Ibrutinib is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).
Agents that may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations
Concomitant use of IMBRUVICA and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit 
CYP3A4 can increase ibrutinib exposure and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
Co-administration of ketoconazole, a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, 
increased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. Simulations using 
fasted conditions suggested that the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin may increase the AUC of 
ibrutinib by a factor of 14. In patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, 
co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole increased Cmax by 6.7-fold and AUC 
by 5.7-fold. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, cobicistat, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose to 140 mg for the duration of the inhibitor use or 
withhold IMBRUVICA temporarily (for 7 days or less). Monitor patient closely for toxicity and 
follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors
In patients with B-cell malignancies taking IMBRUVICA with food, co-administration of the 
CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin increased Cmax by 3.4-fold and AUC by 3.0-fold. If a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, 
crizotinib, diltiazem, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone and dronedarone) is indicated, 
reduce IMBRUVICA dose to 280 mg for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor patient closely for 
toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Mild CYP3A4 inhibitors
Simulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A4 inhibitors azithromycin and 
fluvoxamine may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by <2-fold. No dose adjustment is required in 
combination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification 
guidance as needed.
Co-administration of grapefruit juice, containing CYP3A4 inhibitors, in eight healthy subjects, 
increased exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively. 
Grapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see section 4.2).
45
Agents that may decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations
Administration of IMBRUVICA with inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease ibrutinib plasma 
concentrations.
Co-administration of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, decreased 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) of ibrutinib by 92 and 90%, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong 
or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin). Preparations containing 
St. John's Wort are contraindicated during treatment with IMBRUVICA, as efficacy may be reduced. 
Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A4 induction. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong 
or moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be used, monitor patient closely for lack of efficacy (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). Mild inducers may be used concomitantly with IMBRUVICA, however, patients 
should be monitored for potential lack of efficacy.
Ibrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. A lower Cmax was observed 
in fasted healthy subjects administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 
40 mg once daily for 5 days (see section 5.2). There is no evidence that the lower Cmax would have 
clinical significance, and medicinal products that increase stomach pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) 
have been used without restrictions in the pivotal clinical studies.
Agents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by ibrutinib
Ibrutinib is a P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor in vitro. As no clinical data 
are available on this interaction, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp and 
BCRP after a therapeutic dose. To minimise the potential for an interaction in the GI tract, oral narrow 
therapeutic range, P-gp or BCRP substrates such as digoxin or methotrexate should be taken at least 
6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA. Ibrutinib may also inhibit BCRP in the liver and increase the 
exposure of medicinal products that undergo BCRP-mediated hepatic efflux, such as rosuvastatin.
In studies of ibrutinib (420 mg) in combination with venetoclax (400 mg) in CLL patients, an increase 
in venetoclax exposure (approximately 1.8-fold based on AUC) was observed compared with 
monotherapy data for venetoclax. 
In a drug interaction study in patients with B-cell malignancies, a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib did 
not have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. In the 
same study, 2 weeks of treatment with ibrutinib at 560 mg daily had no clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel), the CYP3A4 substrate 
midazolam, nor the CYP2B6 substrate bupropion.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception in females
Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant 
women. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for up to 3 months 
after ending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective 
contraceptive measures while taking IMBRUVICA and for three months after stopping treatment.
Pregnancy
IMBRUVICA should not be used during pregnancy. There are no data from the use of IMBRUVICA 
in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether ibrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed 
children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
IMBRUVICA.
46
Fertility
No effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the 
maximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose [HED] 16 mg/kg/day) (see 
section 5.3). No human data on the effects of ibrutinib on fertility are available.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
IMBRUVICA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Fatigue, dizziness and asthenia have been reported in some patients taking IMBRUVICA and should 
be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhoea, neutropenia, musculoskeletal 
pain, haemorrhage (e.g., bruising), rash, nausea, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia, and upper respiratory 
tract infection. The most common grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥5%) were neutropenia, 
lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and pneumonia.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety profile is based on pooled data from 1 981 patients treated with IMBRUVICA in four
phase 2 clinical studies and eight randomised phase 3 studies and from post-marketing experience. 
Patients treated for MCL in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 560 mg once daily and patients 
treated for CLL or WM in clinical studies received IMBRUVICA at 420 mg once daily. All patients in 
clinical studies received IMBRUVICA until disease progression or no longer tolerated, except for 
studies with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax where patients received fixed duration 
treatment (Studies CLL3011 and PCYC-1142-CA). The median duration of IMBRUVICA treatment 
across the pooled dataset was 14.7 months. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 
14.7 months (up to 52 months); MCL was 11.7 months (up to 28 months); WM was 21.6 months (up 
to 37 months).
Adverse reactions in patients treated with ibrutinib for B-cell malignancies and post-marketing adverse 
reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are defined as 
follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Discontinuation and dose reduction due to adverse reactions
Of the 1 981 patients treated with IMBRUVICA for B-cell malignancies, 6% discontinued treatment 
primarily due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, rash,
thrombocytopenia, and haemorrhage. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 
approximately 8% of patients.
Elderly
Of the 1 981 patients treated with IMBRUVICA, 50% were 65 years of age or older. Grade 3 or higher 
pneumonia (11% of patients age ≥65 versus 4% of patients <65 years) and thrombocytopenia (11% of 
patients age ≥65 years versus 5% of patients <65 years) occurred more frequently among elderly 
patients treated with IMBRUVICA.
Long-term safety
The safety data from long-term treatment with IMBRUVICA over 5 years from 1 284 patients 
(treatment-naïve CLL/SLL n=162, relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL n=646, relapsed/refractory MCL 
n=370, and WM n=106) were analysed. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 
51 months (range, 0.2 to 98 months) with 70% and 52% of patients receiving treatment for more than 
2 years and 4 years, respectively. The median duration of treatment for MCL was 11 months (range, 0
to 87 months) with 31% and 17% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, 
respectively. The median duration of treatment for WM was 47 months (range, 0.3 to 61 months) with 
78% and 46% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, respectively. The 
overall known safety profile of IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained consistent, other than an 
increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety concerns identified. The prevalence for 
Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 7% (year 1-2), 9% (year 2-3), 9% (year 3-4), and 
9% (year 4-5); the overall incidence for the 5-year period was 11%.
Paediatric population
The safety assessment is based on data from a Phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with 
either a rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and dexamethasone (RICE) regimen, or a 
rituximab, vincristine, ifosfamide, carboplatin, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (RVICI) regimen, as 
background therapy or background therapy alone in paediatric and young adult patients (aged 3 to 
19 years) with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see section 5.1). No new 
adverse reactions were observed in this study.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There are limited data on the effects of IMBRUVICA overdose. No maximum tolerated dose was 
reached in the phase 1 study in which patients received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1 400 mg/day). In a 
separate study, one healthy subject who received a dose of 1 680 mg experienced reversible grade 4 
hepatic enzyme increases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)]. 
There is no specific antidote for IMBRUVICA. Patients who ingested more than the recommended 
dose should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EL01.
49
Mechanism of action
Ibrutinib is a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib forms a 
covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition 
of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signalling 
molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. The BCR pathway is
implicated in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies, including MCL, diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and CLL. BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through the 
B-cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis 
and adhesion. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B-cell 
proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.
In preclinical tumour models, the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax resulted in increased 
cellular apoptosis and anti-tumor activity compared to either agent alone. BTK inhibition by ibrutinib 
increases CLL cell dependence on BCL-2, a cell survival pathway, while venetoclax inhibits BCL-2 
leading to apoptosis. 
Lymphocytosis
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (i.e., ≥50% increase from 
baseline and an absolute count >5 000/mcL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, has 
been observed in about three fourths of patients with CLL treated with IMBRUVICA. This effect has 
also been observed in about one third of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL treated with 
IMBRUVICA. This observed lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be 
considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings. In both disease types, 
lymphocytosis typically occurs during the first month of IMBRUVICA therapy and typically resolves 
within a median of 8.0 weeks in patients with MCL and 14 weeks in patients with CLL. A large 
increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes (e.g., >400 000/mcL) has been observed in some 
patients.
Lymphocytosis was not observed in patients with WM treated with IMBRUVICA.
In vitro platelet aggregation
In an in vitro study, ibrutinib demonstrated inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. 
Ibrutinib did not show meaningful inhibition of platelet aggregation using other agonists of platelet 
aggregation.
Effect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology
The effect of ibrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 20 healthy male and female subjects in a 
randomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic 
dose of 1 680 mg, ibrutinib did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. The 
largest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the baseline adjusted mean differences between 
ibrutinib and placebo was below 10 ms. In this same study, a concentration dependent shortening in 
the QTc interval was observed (-5.3 ms [90% CI: -9.4, -1.1] at a Cmax of 719 ng/mL following the 
supratherapeutic dose of 1 680 mg).
Clinical efficacy and safety
MCL
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were evaluated 
in a single open-label, multi-center phase 2 study (PCYC-1104-CA) of 111 patients. The median age 
was 68 years (range: 40 to 84 years), 77% were male and 92% were Caucasian. Patients with ECOG 
performance status of 3 or greater were excluded from the study. The median time since diagnosis was 
42 months, and median number of prior treatments was 3 (range: 1 to 5 treatments), including 35% 
with prior high-dose chemotherapy, 43% with prior bortezomib, 24% with prior lenalidomide, and 
11% with prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. At baseline, 39% of patients had bulky 
disease (≥5 cm), 49% had high-risk score by Simplified MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI), 
and 72% had advanced disease (extranodal and/or bone marrow involvement) at screening.
50
IMBRUVICA was administered orally at 560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Tumour response was assessed according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) 
for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. The primary endpoint in this study was 
investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR). Responses to IMBRUVICA are shown in Table 2.

The efficacy data was further evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating an 
ORR of 69%, with a 21% complete response (CR) rate and a 48% partial response (PR) rate. The IRC 
estimated median DOR was 19.6 months.
The overall response to IMBRUVICA was independent of prior treatment including bortezomib and 
lenalidomide or underlying risk/prognostic factors, bulky disease, gender or age.
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA were demonstrated in a randomised phase 3, open-label, 
multicenter study including 280 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy (Study 
MCL3001). Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA orally at 560 mg once daily 
for 21 days or temsirolimus intravenously at 175 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of the first cycle followed by 
75 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Treatment on both arms continued until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years (range, 34; 88 years), 74% 
were male and 87% were Caucasian. The median time since diagnosis was 43 months, and median 
number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 9 treatments), including 51% with prior high-dose 
chemotherapy, 18% with prior bortezomib, 5% with prior lenalidomide, and 24% with prior stem cell 
transplant. At baseline, 53% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 21% had high-risk score by 
Simplified MIPI, 60% had extranodal disease and 54% had bone marrow involvement at screening.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to the revised International Working 
Group (IWG) for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) criteria. Efficacy results for Study MCL3001 are 
shown in Table 3 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS in Figure 1.

Patients previously untreated for CLL
Single agent
A randomised, multicenter, open-label phase 3 study (PCYC-1115-CA) of IMBRUVICA versus 
chlorambucil was conducted in patients with treatment-naïve CLL who were 65 years of age or older. 
Patients between 65 and 70 years of age were required to have at least one comorbidity that precluded 
the use of frontline chemo-immunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. 
Patients (n=269) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity, or chlorambucil at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 
15 of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles, with an allowance for intrapatient dose increases 
up to 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerability. After confirmed disease progression, patients on chlorambucil 
were able to crossover to ibrutinib.
The median age was 73 years (range, 65 to 90 years), 63% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. 
Ninety one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 9% had an 
ECOG performance status of 2. The study enrolled 269 patients with CLL. At baseline, 45% had 
advanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 35% of patients had at least one tumor ≥5 cm, 39% with 
baseline anaemia, 23% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 65% had elevated β2 microglobulin 
>3 500 mcg/L, 47% had a CrCL<60 mL/min, 20% of patients presented with del11q, 6% of patients 
presented with del17p/tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation, and 44% of patients presented with 
unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV).
Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC according to International Workshop on CLL 
(IWCLL) criteria indicated an 84% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression 
52
in the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1115-CA are shown in Table 4 and the 
Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
There was a statistically significant sustained platelet or haemoglobin improvement in the ITT 
population in favor of ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In patients with baseline cytopenias, sustained 
haematologic improvement was: platelets 77.1% versus 42.9%; haemoglobin 84.3% versus 45.5% for 
ibrutinib and chlorambucil, respectively.

48-month follow-up 
With a median follow-up time on study of 48 months in Study PCYC-1115-CA and its extension 
study, an 86% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed 
for patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS was not reached in the 
IMBRUVICA arm and was 15 months [95% CI (10.22, 19.35)] in the chlorambucil arm; (HR=0.14 
[95% CI (0.09, 0.21)]). The 4-year PFS estimate was 73.9% in the IMBRUVICA arm and 15.5% in 
the chlorambucil arm, respectively. The updated Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 4. 
The investigator-assessed ORR was 91.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 36.8% in the chlorambucil 
arm. The CR rate according to IWCLL criteria was 16.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm versus 3.0% in the 
chlorambucil arm. At the time of long-term follow-up, a total of 73 subjects (54.9%) originally 
randomised to the chlorambucil arm subsequently received ibrutinib as cross-over treatment. The 
Kaplan-Meier landmark estimate for OS at 48-months was 85.5% in the IMBRUVICA arm.
The treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1115-CA was consistent across high-risk patients 
with del17p/TP53 mutation, del11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.

Combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL were further 
evaluated in a randomised, multi-center, open-label, phase 3 study (PCYC-1130-CA) of IMBRUVICA 
in combination with obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. The study 
enrolled patients who were 65 years of age or older or <65 years of age with coexisting medical 
conditions, reduced renal function as measured by creatinine clearance <70 mL/min, or presence of 
del17p/TP53 mutation. Patients (n=229) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg 
daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or chlorambucil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on 
Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. In both arms, patients received 1 000 mg of 
obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8 and 15 of the first cycle, followed by treatment on the first day of 
5 subsequent cycles (total of 6 cycles, 28 days each). The first dose of obinutuzumab was divided 
between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg). 
The median age was 71 years (range, 40 to 87 years), 64% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (48%) or 1-2 (52%). At baseline, 52% had 
advanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 32% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 44% with 
baseline anaemia, 22% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 28% had a CrCL <60 mL/min, and the 
median Cumulative Illness Rating Score for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) was 4 (range, 0 to 12). At baseline, 
65% of patients presented with CLL/SLL with high risk factors (del17p/TP53 mutation [18%], del11q 
[15%], or unmutated IGHV [54%]). 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 77% 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression in the IMBRUVICA arm. With a 
median follow-up time on study of 31 months, the median PFS was not reached in the 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab arm and was 19 months in the chlorambucil+obinutuzumab arm. 
Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1130-CA are shown in Table 5 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS 
is shown in Figure 5.

Any grade infusion-related reactions were observed in 25% of patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 58% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab. Grade 3 
or higher or serious infusion-related reactions were observed in 3% of patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 9% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab.
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL or SLL were 
further evaluated in a randomised, multi-center, open-label, phase 3 study (E1912) of IMBRUVICA in 
combination with rituximab (IR) versus standard fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) 
chemo-immunotherapy. The study enrolled previously untreated patients with CLL or SLL who were 
70 years or younger. Patients with del17p were excluded from the study. Patients (n=529) were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either IR or FCR. IMBRUVICA was administered at a dose of 420 mg daily 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Fludarabine was administered at a dose of 
25 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide was administered at a dose of 250 mg/m2, both on Days 1, 2, and 3 
of Cycles 1-6. Rituximab was initiated in Cycle 2 for the IR arm and in Cycle 1 for the FCR arm and 
was administered at a dose of 50 mg/m2 on Day 1 of the first cycle, 325 mg/m2 on Day 2 of the first 
cycle, and 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of 5 subsequent cycles, for a total of 6 cycles. Each cycle was 28 days.
The median age was 58 years (range, 28 to 70 years), 67% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (98%) or 2 (2%). At baseline, 43% of 
patients presented with Rai Stage III or IV, and 59% of patients presented with CLL/SLL with high 
risk factors (TP53 mutation [6%], del11q [22%], or unmutated IGHV [53%]).
With a median follow-up time on study of 37 months, efficacy results for E1912 are shown in Table 7.

Fixed duration combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of fixed duration therapy with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax 
versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated CLL 
were evaluated in a randomised, open-label, phase 3 (CLL3011) study. The study enrolled patients 
with previously untreated CLL who were 65 years or older, and adult patients <65 years of age with a 
CIRS score >6 or CrCL ≥30 to <70 mL/min. Patients with del 17p or known TP53 mutations were 
excluded. Patients (n=211) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA in combination with 
venetoclax or chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the IMBRUVICA plus
59
venetoclax arm received single agent IMBRUVICA for 3 cycles followed by IMBRUVICA in 
combination with venetoclax for 12 cycles (including 5-week dose-titration schedule). Each cycle was 
28 days. IMBRUVICA was administered at a dose of 420 mg daily. Venetoclax was administered 
daily, starting with 20 mg for 1 week, followed by 1 week at each dose level of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 
200 mg, then the recommended daily dose of 400 mg. Patients randomised to the chlorambucil plus
obinutuzumab arm received treatment for 6 cycles. Obinutuzumab was administered at a dose of 
1 000 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 in Cycle 1. In Cycles 2 to 6, 1 000 mg obinutuzumab was given on 
Day 1. Chlorambucil was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight on Days 1 and 15 of 
Cycles 1 to 6. Patients with confirmed progression by IWCLL criteria after completion of either fixed 
duration regimen could be treated with single-agent IMBRUVICA. 
The median age was 71 years (range, 47 to 93 years), 58% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (35%), 1 (53%), or 2 (12%). At baseline, 18% 
of patients presented with CLL with del 11q and 52% with unmutated IGHV.
At baseline assessment for risk of tumor lysis syndrome, 25% of patients had high tumor burden. After 
3 cycles of single-agent IMBRUVICA lead-in therapy, 2% of patients had high tumor burden. High 
tumor burden was defined as any lymph node ≥10 cm; or any lymph node ≥5 cm and absolute 
lymphocyte count ≥25×109/L.
With a median follow-up time on study of 28 months, efficacy results for Study CLL3011 assessed by 
an IRC according to IWCLL criteria are shown in Table 9, the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown

IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax and, at the corresponding time point, was 12.4% (13/105) by NGS 
assay and 16.2% (17/105) by flow cytometry in patients treated with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab.
TLS was reported in 6 patients treated with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab and no TLS was reported 
in IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax.
Overall follow-up of 58 months (median of 52 months)
With an overall follow-up of 58 months (median follow-up time on study of 52 months) in Study 
CLL3011, a 77% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was 
observed for patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The overall survival hazard ratio was 0.458 [95% CI 
(0.257, 0.818), nominal p=0.0068, not type 1 error controlled]. There were 17 (16.0%) deaths in the 
IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax arm and 36 (34.3%) in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab arm. 
Median time to next treatment was not reached for either arm (HR=0.164; 95% CI: 0.081, 0.330) with 
9.4% of subjects in the IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax arm and 41.0% of subjects in the chlorambucil 
plus obinutuzumab arm having initiated subsequent anticancer therapy.

The safety and efficacy of fixed duration therapy with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax
in patients with previously untreated CLL were further evaluated in a cohort of the phase 2, 
multi-center, 2-cohort study (PCYC-1142-CA). The study enrolled previously untreated patients with 
CLL who were 70 years or younger. The study enrolled 323 patients, of these, 159 patients were 
enrolled to fixed duration therapy consisting of 3 cycles of single agent IMBRUVICA followed by 
IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax for 12 cycles (including 5-week dose titration 
schedule). Each cycle was 28 days. IMBRUVICA was administered at a dose of 420 mg daily. 
Venetoclax was administered daily, starting with 20 mg for 1 week, followed by 1 week at each dose 
level of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, then the recommended daily dose of 400 mg. Patients with 
confirmed progression by IWCLL criteria after completion of the fixed duration regimen could be 
retreated with single-agent IMBRUVICA.
The median age was 60 years (range, 33 to 71 years), 67% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. All 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (69%) or 1 (31%). At baseline, 13% of patients 
had del 17p, 18% with del 11q, 17% with del 17p/TP53 mutation, 56% with unmutated IGHV and 
19% with complex karyotype. At baseline assessment for risk of tumor lysis syndrome, 21% of 
patients had high tumor burden. 
63
After 3 cycles of single-agent IMBRUVICA lead-in therapy, 1% of patients had high tumor burden. 
High tumor burden was defined as any lymph node ≥10 cm, or any lymph node ≥5 cm and absolute 
lymphocyte count ≥25×109/L.
With a median follow-up time on study of 28 months, efficacy results for PCYC-1142-CA assessed by 
an IRC according to IWCLL criteria are shown in Table 11, and rates of minimal residual disease 
(MRD) negativity are shown in Table 12.

No TLS was reported in patients treated with IMBRUVICA in combination with venetoclax.
Patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy
Single agent
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with CLL were demonstrated in one uncontrolled 
study and one randomised, controlled study. The open-label, multi-center study (PCYC-1102-CA) 
included 51 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, who received 420 mg once daily. IMBRUVICA 
was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years 
(range: 37 to 82 years), median time since diagnosis was 80 months, and median number of prior 
treatments was 4 (range: 1 to 12 treatments), including 92.2% with a prior nucleoside analog, 98.0% 
with prior rituximab, 86.3% with a prior alkylator, 39.2% with prior bendamustine and 19.6% with 
prior ofatumumab. At baseline, 39.2% of patients had Rai Stage IV, 45.1% had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 
35.3% had deletion 17p and 31.4% had deletion 11q.
ORR was assessed according to the 2008 IWCLL criteria by investigators and IRC. At a median 
duration follow-up of 16.4 months, the ORR by IRC for the 51 relapsed or refractory patients was 
64.7% (95% CI: 50.1%; 77.6%), all PRs. The ORR including PR with lymphocytosis was 70.6%. 
Median time to response was 1.9 months. The DOR ranged from 3.9 to 24.2+ months. The median 
DOR was not reached.
A randomised, multi-center, open-label phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA versus ofatumumab 
(PCYC-1112-CA) was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Patients (n=391) were 
randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, or ofatumumab for up to 12 doses (300/2 000 mg). Fifty-seven patients randomised to 
ofatumumab crossed over following progression to receive IMBRUVICA. The median age was 
67 years (range: 30 to 88 years), 68% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 91 months and the median 
number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 13 treatments). At baseline, 58% of patients had at least 
one tumour ≥5 cm. Thirty-two percent of patients had deletion 17p (with 50% of patients having 
deletion 17p/TP53 mutation), 24% had 11q deletion, and 47% of patients had unmutated IGHV.
Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by an IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 78% 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression for patients in the IMBRUVICA 
arm. Analysis of OS demonstrated a 57% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death for 
patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. Efficacy results for Study PCYC-1112-CA are shown in Table 13.

Final Analysis at 65-month follow-up
With a median follow-up time on study of 65 months in Study PCYC-1112-CA, an 85% reduction in 
the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed for patients in the 
IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS according to IWCLL criteria was 
44.1 months [95% CI (38.47, 56.18)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 8.1 months [95% CI (7.79, 8.25)] 
in the ofatumumab arm, respectively; HR=0.15 [95% CI (0.11, 0.20)]. The updated Kaplan-Meier 
curve for PFS is shown in Figure 11. The investigator-assessed ORR in the IMBRUVICA arm was 
87.7% versus 22.4% in the ofatumumab arm. At the time of final analysis, 133 (67.9%) of the 
196 subjects originally randomised to the ofatumumab treatment arm had crossed over to ibrutinib 
treatment. The median investigator-assessed PFS2 (time from randomisation until PFS event after first 
subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy) according to IWCLL criteria was 65.4 months [95% CI (51.61, not 
estimable)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 38.5 months [95% CI (19.98, 47.24)] in the ofatumumab 
66
arm, respectively; HR=0.54 [95% CI (0.41, 0.71)]. The median OS was 67.7 months [95% CI (61.0, 
not estimable)] in the IMBRUVICA arm.
The treatment effect of ibrutinib in Study PCYC-1112-CA was consistent across high-risk patients 
with deletion 17p/TP53 mutation, deletion 11q, and/or unmutated IGHV.

Combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients previously treated for CLL were further evaluated 
in a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with BR 
versus placebo+BR (Study CLL3001). Patients (n=578) were randomised 1:1 to receive either 
IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily or placebo in combination with BR until disease progression, or 
unacceptable toxicity. All patients received BR for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Bendamustine 
was dosed at 70 mg/m2 infused IV over 30 minutes on Cycle 1, Days 2 and 3, and on Cycles 2-6, 
Days 1 and 2 for up to 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in the first cycle, 
Day 1, and 500 mg/m2 Cycles 2 through 6, Day 1. Ninety patients randomised to placebo+BR crossed 
over to receive IMBRUVICA following IRC confirmed progression. The median age was 64 years 
(range, 31 to 86 years), 66% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 6 years and the median number of 
prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, 56% of patients had at least one tumour 
≥5 cm, 26% had del11q.
Progression free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria. Efficacy results for 
Study CLL3001 are shown in Table 15.

WM
Single agent
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM (IgM-excreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) were 
evaluated in an open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial of 63 previously treated patients. The median 
age was 63 years (range: 44 to 86 years), 76% were male, and 95% were Caucasian. All patients had a 
baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 74 months, and the 
median number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, the median serum 
IgM value was 3.5 g/dL, and 60% of patients were anaemic (haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL or 6.8 mmol/L).
IMBRUVICA was administered orally at 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. The primary endpoint in this study was ORR per investigator assessment. The ORR and DOR 
were assessed using criteria adopted from the Third International Workshop of WM. Responses to 
IMBRUVICA are shown in Table 16.

and a 51% PR rate.
Combination therapy
The safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM were further evaluated in patients with treatment-
naïve or previously treated WM in a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of 
IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab versus placebo in combination with rituximab 
(PCYC-1127-CA). Patients (n=150) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg 
daily or placebo in combination with rituximab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Rituximab was administered weekly at a dose of 375 mg/m2 for 4 consecutive weeks (weeks 1-4) 
followed by a second course of weekly rituximab for 4 consecutive weeks (weeks 17-20).
The median age was 69 years (range, 36 to 89 years), 66% were male, and 79% were Caucasian. 
Ninety-three percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 7% of patients 
had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-five percent of patients were treatment-naïve, and 
55% of patients were previously treated. The median time since diagnosis was 52.6 months (treatment-
68
naïve patients=6.5 months and previously treated patients=94.3 months). Among previously treated 
patients, the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 6 treatments). At baseline, the 
median serum IgM value was 3.2 g/dL (range, 0.6 to 8.3 g/dL), 63% of patients were anaemic 
(haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL or 6.8 mmol/L) and MYD88 L265P mutations were present in 77% of 
patients, absent in 13% of patients, and 9% of patients were not evaluable for mutation status.
At the primary analysis, with a median follow-up of 26.5 months, the IRC-assessed PFS hazard ratio 
was 0.20 [95% CI (0.11, 0.38)]. PFS hazard ratios for treatment-naïve patients, previously treated 
patients, and patients with or without MYD88 L265P mutations were consistent with the PFS hazard 
ratio for the ITT population.
Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions were observed in 1% of patients treated with 
IMBRUVICA+rituximab and 16% of patients treated with placebo+rituximab.
Tumor flare in the form of IgM increase occurred in 8.0% of subjects in the IMBRUVICA+rituximab 
arm and 46.7% of subjects in the placebo+rituximab arm.
Final Analysis at 63-month follow-up
With an overall follow-up of 63 months, efficacy results as assessed by an IRC at the time of the final 
analysis for PCYC-1127-CA are shown in Table 17 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in 
Figure 12. PFS hazard ratios for treatment-naïve patients (0.31 [95% CI (0.14, 0.69)]) and previously 
treated patients (0.22 [95% CI (0.11, 0.43)]) were consistent with the PFS hazard ratio for the ITT 
population.

Figure 12: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS (ITT Population) in Study PCYC-1127-CA (Final 
Analysis)
Study PCYC-1127-CA had a separate monotherapy arm of 31 patients with previously treated WM 
who failed prior rituximab-containing therapy and received single agent IMBRUVICA. The median 
age was 67 years (range, 47 to 90 years). Eighty-one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1, and 19% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. The median 
number of prior treatments was 4 (range, 1 to 7 treatments). With an overall follow-up of 61 months, 
the response rate observed in Study PCYC-1127-CA monotherapy arm per IRC assessment was 77% 
(0% CR, 29% VGPR, 48% PR). The median duration of response was 33 months (range, 2.4 to 60.2+ 
months). The overall response rate per IRC observed in the monotherapy arm was 87% (0% CR, 29% 
VGPR, 48% PR, 10% MR). The median duration of overall response was 39 months (range, 2.07 to 
60.2+ months).
Paediatric population
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of IMBRUVICA in paediatric and young adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were evaluated in a two-part, multi-
centre, open-label Phase 3 study (LYM3003) of IMBRUVICA in combination with either a rituximab, 
ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide and dexamethasone (RICE) regimen or a rituximab, vincristine, 
ifosfamide, carboplatin, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (RVICI) regimen, as background therapy. 
70
Part 1 of the study (21 patients aged 3 to 17 years) evaluated the dose to be used in part 2 (51 patients 
aged 3 to 19 years) (see section 5.2).
In part 2, patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA as 440 mg/m2 daily (age 
below 12 years) or 329 mg/m2 (age 12 years and older) with background therapy, or background 
therapy alone until completion of 3 cycles of therapy, transplantation, disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) superiority was not met 
suggesting no additional benefit from adding ibrutinib to RICE or RVICI (see section 4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Ibrutinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hours. Absolute 
bioavailability in fasted condition (n=8) was 2.9% (90% CI=2.1 – 3.9) and doubled when combined 
with a meal. Pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib does not significantly differ in patients with different B-cell 
malignancies. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The steady state AUC observed 
in patients at 560 mg is (mean ± standard deviation) 953 ± 705 ng h/mL. Administration of ibrutinib in 
fasted condition resulted in approximately 60% of exposure (AUClast) as compared to either 
30 minutes before, 30 minutes after (fed condition) or 2 hours after a high fat breakfast.
Ibrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In fasted healthy subjects 
administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, 
compared to ibrutinib alone, geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 83% (68-102%), 92% (78-110%), 
and 38% (26-53%) for AUC0-24, AUClast, and Cmax, respectively.
Distribution
Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration 
dependence in the range of 50 to 1 000 ng/mL. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vd, ss/F) was approximately 10 000 L.
Metabolism
Ibrutinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 to produce a dihydrodiol metabolite with an inhibitory 
activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib. Involvement of CYP2D6 in 
the metabolism of ibrutinib appears to be minimal.
Therefore, no precautions are necessary in patients with different CYP2D6 genotypes.
Elimination
Apparent clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1 000 L/h. The half-life of ibrutinib is 4 to 13 hours.
After a single oral administration of radiolabeled [14C]-ibrutinib in healthy subjects, approximately 
90% of radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours, with the majority (80%) excreted in the faeces 
and <10% accounted for in urine. Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for approximately 1% of the 
radiolabeled excretion product in faeces and none in urine.
Special populations
Elderly
Population pharmacokinetics indicated that age does not significantly influence ibrutinib clearance 
from the circulation.
Paediatric population
Pharmacokinetic data show that ibrutinib exposures in children with relapsed or refractory mature B-
cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, aged 12 years and older receiving a daily dose of 329 mg/m2 and those 
aged 3 years to below 12 years receiving a daily dose of 440 mg/m2, were generally within the range 
of exposures observed in adult patients administered a daily dose of 560 mg.
71
Gender
Population pharmacokinetics data indicated that gender does not significantly influence ibrutinib 
clearance from the circulation.
Race
There are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics.
Body weight
Population pharmacokinetics data indicated that body weight (range: 41-146 kg; mean [SD]: 
83 [19 kg]) had a negligible effect on ibrutinib clearance.
Renal impairment
Ibrutinib has minimal renal clearance; urinary excretion of metabolites is <10% of the dose. No 
specific studies have been conducted to date in subjects with impaired renal function. There are no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
Ibrutinib is metabolised in the liver. A hepatic impairment trial was performed in non-cancer subjects 
administered a single dose of 140 mg of medicinal product under fasting conditions. The effect of 
impaired liver function varied substantially between individuals, but on average a 2.7-, 8.2-, and 
9.8-fold increase in ibrutinib exposure (AUClast) was observed in subjects with mild (n=6, Child-Pugh 
class A), moderate (n=10, Child-Pugh class B) and severe (n=8, Child-Pugh class C) hepatic 
impairment, respectively. The free fraction of ibrutinib also increased with degree of impairment, with 
3.0, 3.8 and 4.8% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver impairment, respectively, compared 
to 3.3% in plasma from matched healthy controls within this study. The corresponding increase in 
unbound ibrutinib exposure (AUCunbound, last) is estimated to be 4.1-, 9.8-, and 13-fold in subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see section 4.2).
Co-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-gp, nor other major transporters, except 
OCT2. The dihydrodiol metabolite and other metabolites are P-gp substrates. Ibrutinib is an in vitro
inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP (see section 4.5).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
The following adverse effects were seen in studies of 13-weeks duration in rats and dogs. Ibrutinib 
was found to induce gastrointestinal effects (soft faeces/diarrhoea and/or inflammation) and lymphoid 
depletion in rats and dogs with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day in 
both species. Based on mean exposure (AUC) at the 560 mg/day clinical dose, AUC ratios were 
2.6 and 21 at the NOAEL in male and female rats, and 0.4 and 1.8 at the NOAEL in male and female 
dogs, respectively. Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOEL) (60 mg/kg/day) margins in the dog are 
3.6-fold (males) and 2.3-fold (females). In rats, moderate pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (considered 
adverse) was observed at doses of ≥100 mg/kg in male rats (AUC exposure margin of 2.6-fold) and 
not observed in females at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 21.3-fold). Mildly 
decreased trabecular and cortical bone was seen in female rats administered ≥100 mg/kg/day (AUC 
exposure margin of 20.3-fold). All gastrointestinal, lymphoid and bone findings recovered following 
recovery periods of 6-13 weeks. Pancreatic findings partially recovered during comparable reversal 
periods.
Juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted.
Carcinogenicity/genotoxicity
Ibrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse at oral doses up 
to 2 000 mg/kg/day with an exposure margin of approximately 23 (males) to 37 (females) times the 
human AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily.
Ibrutinib has no genotoxic properties when tested in bacteria, mammalian cells or in mice.
72
Reproductive toxicity
In pregnant rats, ibrutinib at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day was associated with increased post-implantation 
loss and increased visceral (heart and major vessels) malformations and skeletal variations with an 
exposure margin 14 times the AUC found in patients at a daily dose of 560 mg. At a dose of 
≥40 mg/kg/day, ibrutinib was associated with decreased foetal weights (AUC ratio of ≥5.6 as 
compared to daily dose of 560 mg in patients). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 1.3 times the AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).
In pregnant rabbits, ibrutinib at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day or greater was associated with skeletal 
malformations (fused sternebrae) and ibrutinib at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day was associated with 
increased post-implantation loss. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rabbits at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 2.0 times the exposure (AUC) in patients with MCL administered ibrutinib 560 mg 
daily and 2.8 times the exposure in patients with CLL or WM receiving ibrutinib dose 420 mg per 
day). Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the AUC of 
ibrutinib at a dose of 560 mg daily) (see section 4.6).
Fertility
No effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the 
maximum dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (HED 16 mg/kg/day).

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What IMBRUVICA is and what it is used for
What IMBRUVICA is
IMBRUVICA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance ibrutinib. It belongs to a 
class of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors.
What IMBRUVICA is used for
It is used to treat the following blood cancers in adults:

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a type of cancer affecting the lymph nodes, when the disease has 
come back or has not responded to treatment.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called 
lymphocytes that also involves the lymph nodes. IMBRUVICA is used in patients who have not 
previously been treated for CLL or when the disease has come back or has not responded to 
treatment.
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called 
lymphocytes. It is used in patients who have not previously been treated for WM or when the 
disease has come back or has not responded to treatment or in patients for whom chemotherapy 
given together with an antibody is not a suitable therapy.
How IMBRUVICA works
In MCL, CLL and WM, IMBRUVICA works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a protein in the 
body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, IMBRUVICA helps kill 
and reduce the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of the cancer.
2. What you need to know before you take IMBRUVICA
Do not take IMBRUVICA

if you are allergic to ibrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John’s Wort, used for depression. If you are not 
sure about this, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine.


Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IMBRUVICA:

if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that 
increase your risk of bleeding (see section “Other medicines and IMBRUVICA”)
if you have irregular heart beat or have a history of irregular heart beat or severe heart failure, or 
if you feel any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, 
fainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs
if you have liver problems, including if you ever had or now have a hepatitis B infection (a liver 
infection)
if you have high blood pressure
if you have recently had any surgery, especially if this might affect how you absorb food or 
medicines from your stomach or gut
if you are planning to have any surgery– your doctor may ask you to stop taking IMBRUVICA
for a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery
if you have kidney problems.






If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
or while taking this medicine (see section “Possible side effects”).
When taking IMBRUVICA, tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: 
memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare but 
serious brain infection which can be fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML).
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: sudden numbness or weakness 
in the limbs (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding 
speech, sight loss, difficulty walking, loss of balance or lack of coordination, sudden severe headache 
with no known cause. These may be signs and symptoms of stroke.
Tell your doctor immediately if you develop left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib 
cage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of rupture of the spleen) after you stop 
taking IMBRUVICA.
Effects on the heart
Treatment with IMBRUVICA may affect the heart, especially if you already have heart diseases such 
as rhythm problems, heart failure, high blood pressure, have diabetes or are of advanced age. The 
effects may be severe and could cause death, including sometimes sudden death. Your heart function 
will be checked before and during treatment with IMBRUVICA. Tell your doctor immediately if you 
feel breathless, have difficulty breathing when lying down, swelling of the feet, ankles or legs and 
weakness/tiredness during treatment with IMBRUVICA – these may be signs of heart failure.
You may experience viral, bacterial, or fungal infections during treatment with IMBRUVICA. Contact 
your doctor if you have fever, chills, weakness, confusion, body aches, cold or flu symptoms, feel tired 
or feel short of breath, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). These could be signs of an infection.
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
There have been rare reports of excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation 
(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. If you 
experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your 
doctor immediately.
Tests and check-ups before and during treatment
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown 
of cancer cells have happened during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without treatment. This 
may lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another 
healthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS.
115
Lymphocytosis: Laboratory tests may show an increase in white blood cells (called “lymphocytes”) in 
your blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This 
does not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts before or during the treatment and in rare cases they may need to give you another medicine. 
Talk to your doctor about what your test results mean.
Events related to the liver: Your doctor will do some blood tests to check whether your liver is 
working properly or that you do not have a liver infection, known as viral hepatitis, or whether 
hepatitis B has become active again, which could be fatal.
Children and adolescents
IMBRUVICA should not be used in children and adolescents.
Other medicines and IMBRUVICA
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and 
supplements. This is because IMBRUVICA may affect the way some other medicines work. Also
some other medicines can affect the way IMBRUVICA works.
IMBRUVICA may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes:

acetyl salicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or 
naproxen
blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin or other medicines for blood clots
supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed.


If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking IMBRUVICA.
Also tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines – The effects of IMBRUVICA or 
other medicines may be influenced if you take IMBRUVICA together with any of the following
medicines:

medicines called antibiotics to treat bacterial infections – clarithromycin, telithromycin, 
ciprofloxacin, erythromycin or rifampicin
medicines for fungal infections – posaconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole or 
voriconazole
medicines for HIV infection – ritonavir, cobicistat, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, 
atazanavir, or fosamprenavir
medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy - aprepitant
medicines for depression - nefazodone
medicines called kinase inhibitors for treatment of other cancers – crizotinib or imatinib
medicines called calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure or chest pain – diltiazem or
verapamil
medicines called statins to treat high cholesterol - rosuvastatin
heart medicines/anti-arrhythmics – amiodarone or dronedarone
medicines to prevent seizures or to treat epilepsy, or medicines to treat a painful condition of the 
face called trigeminal neuralgia – carbamazepine or phenytoin.





If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking IMBRUVICA.
If you are taking digoxin, a medicine used for heart problems, or methotrexate, a medicine used to 
treat other cancers and to reduce the activity of the immune system (e.g., for rheumatoid arthritis or 
psoriasis), it should be taken at least 6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA.
116
IMBRUVICA with food
Do not take IMBRUVICA with grapefruit or Seville oranges (bitter oranges) – this includes 
eating them, drinking the juice or taking a supplement that might contain them. This is because it can 
increase the amount of IMBRUVICA in your blood.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What IMBRUVICA is and what it is used for
What IMBRUVICA is
IMBRUVICA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance ibrutinib. It belongs to a 
class of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors.
What IMBRUVICA is used for
It is used to treat the following blood cancers in adults:



Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a type of cancer affecting the lymph nodes, when the disease has 
come back or has not responded to treatment.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called 
lymphocytes that also involves the lymph nodes. IMBRUVICA is used in patients who have not 
previously been treated for CLL or when the disease has come back or has not responded to 
treatment.
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called 
lymphocytes. It is used in patients who have not previously been treated for WM or when the 
disease has come back or has not responded to treatment or in patients for whom chemotherapy 
given together with an antibody is not a suitable therapy.
How IMBRUVICA works
In MCL, CLL and WM, IMBRUVICA works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a protein in the 
body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, IMBRUVICA helps kill 
and reduce the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of the cancer.
2. What you need to know before you take IMBRUVICA
Do not take IMBRUVICA

if you are allergic to ibrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
122

if you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John’s Wort, used for depression. If you are not 
sure about this, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IMBRUVICA:

if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that 
increase your risk of bleeding (see section “Other medicines and IMBRUVICA”)
if you have irregular heart beat or have a history of irregular heart beat or severe heart failure, or 
if you feel any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, 
fainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs
if you have liver problems, including if you ever had or now have a hepatitis B infection (a liver 
infection)
if you have high blood pressure
if you have recently had any surgery, especially if this might affect how you absorb food or 
medicines from your stomach or gut
if you are planning to have any surgery– your doctor may ask you to stop taking IMBRUVICA 
for a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery
if you have kidney problems.






If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
or while taking this medicine (see section “Possible side effects”).
When taking IMBRUVICA, tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: 
memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare but 
serious brain infection which can be fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML).
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: sudden numbness or weakness 
in the limbs (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding 
speech, sight loss, difficulty walking, loss of balance or lack of coordination, sudden severe headache 
with no known cause. These may be signs and symptoms of stroke.
Tell your doctor immediately if you develop left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib 
cage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of rupture of the spleen) after you stop 
taking IMBRUVICA.
Effects on the heart
Treatment with IMBRUVICA may affect the heart, especially if you already have heart diseases such 
as rhythm problems, heart failure, high blood pressure, have diabetes or are of advanced age. The 
effects may be severe and could cause death, including sometimes sudden death. Your heart function 
will be checked before and during treatment with IMBRUVICA. Tell your doctor immediately if you 
feel breathless, have difficulty breathing when lying down, swelling of the feet, ankles or legs and 
weakness/tiredness during treatment with IMBRUVICA – these may be signs of heart failure.
You may experience viral, bacterial, or fungal infections during treatment with IMBRUVICA. Contact 
your doctor if you have fever, chills, weakness, confusion, body aches, cold or flu symptoms, feel tired 
or feel short of breath, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). These could be signs of an infection. 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
There have been rare reports of excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation 
(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. If you 
experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your 
doctor immediately.
Tests and check-ups before and during treatment
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown 
of cancer cells have happened during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without treatment. This 
123
may lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another 
healthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS.
Lymphocytosis: Laboratory tests may show an increase in white blood cells (called “lymphocytes”) in 
your blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This 
does not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts before or during the treatment and in rare cases they may need to give you another medicine. 
Talk to your doctor about what your test results mean.
Events related to the liver: Your doctor will do some blood tests to check whether your liver is 
working properly or that you do not have a liver infection, known as viral hepatitis, or whether 
hepatitis B has become active again, which could be fatal.
Children and adolescents
IMBRUVICA should not be used in children and adolescents.
Other medicines and IMBRUVICA
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and 
supplements. This is because IMBRUVICA may affect the way some other medicines work. Also 
some other medicines can affect the way IMBRUVICA works.
IMBRUVICA may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes:

acetyl salicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or 
naproxen
blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin or other medicines for blood clots
supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed.


If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking IMBRUVICA.
Also tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines – The effects of IMBRUVICA or 
other medicines may be influenced if you take IMBRUVICA together with any of the following 
medicines:

medicines called antibiotics to treat bacterial infections – clarithromycin, telithromycin, 
ciprofloxacin, erythromycin or rifampicin
medicines for fungal infections – posaconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole or 
voriconazole
medicines for HIV infection – ritonavir, cobicistat, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, 
atazanavir, or fosamprenavir
medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy - aprepitant
medicines for depression - nefazodone
medicines called kinase inhibitors for treatment of other cancers – crizotinib or imatinib
medicines called calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure or chest pain – diltiazem or 
verapamil
medicines called statins to treat high cholesterol - rosuvastatin
heart medicines/anti-arrhythmics – amiodarone or dronedarone
medicines to prevent seizures or to treat epilepsy, or medicines to treat a painful condition of the 
face called trigeminal neuralgia – carbamazepine or phenytoin.

124
If you are taking digoxin, a medicine used for heart problems, or methotrexate, a medicine used to 
treat other cancers and to reduce the activity of the immune system (e.g., for rheumatoid arthritis or 
psoriasis), it should be taken at least 6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA.
IMBRUVICA with food
Do not take IMBRUVICA with grapefruit or Seville oranges (bitter oranges) – this includes 
eating them, drinking the juice or taking a supplement that might contain them. This is because it can 
increase the amount of IMBRUVICA in your blood.

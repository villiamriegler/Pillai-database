1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.4 (type II): Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to describe the persistence of anti-HBs 
antibodies in subjects 6 years of age having received 
a hexavalent vaccine based on the final results from 
study A3L00052; this is a phase IV, open-label, 
multi-centre study in children previously vaccinated 
in Study A3L38a with 3 doses of either 
hepatitis B component of Hexyon/Hexacima was evaluated 
in infants. For a 2-dose primary infant series at 3 and 5 
months of age without hepatitis B at birth, followed by a 
toddler booster at 11-12 months of age, 53.8% of children 
were seroprotected (anti-HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL) at 6 years 
of age, and 96.7% presented an anamnestic response after 
a challenge dose with a standalone Hepatitis B vaccine. 
These data support persisting immune memory induced in 
infants primed with Hexyon/Hexacima. 
Immunogenicity data in HIV-exposed infants (infected and 
Hexacima/Hexyon (Group 1) or Infanrix Hexa (Group 
uninfected) showed that Hexyon//Hexacima is

C.I.4 (type II): Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC  in order to reword safety and immunogenicity 
information regarding individuals with 
immunodeficiency based on the final results from

of HIV-exposed infants whatever their HIV status at birth. 
No specific safety concern was observed in this population. 
Inclusion of syncope within the precautions for use. 
Syncope can occur following, or even before, any 
vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle 
injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling

C.I.4 (type II) - Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC in order to revise the warning regarding 
preterm infants and to add new information on 
immunogenicity in preterm infants and in infants 
born from women vaccinated during pregnancy, 
based on the final results from study A3L00053-EXT; 
this is an observational cohort study conducted by 
the Center for the Evaluation of Vaccination in 
Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Institute of 
immunogenicity data have been made available for 105 
preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 28 to 36 
weeks). These data support the use of 
Hexacima/Hexaxim/Hexyon in preterm infants. As expected 
in preterm infants, lower immune response has been 
observed for some antigens, when indirectly compared to 
term infants, although seroprotective levels have been 
achieved. Immune responses to 
Hexacima/Hexaxim/Hexyon in infants born (preterm and 
term) to women vaccinated with Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria 
and acellular pertussis) during pregnancy were included in 
the product information. The rate of seroprotected prior to 
their own primary vaccination is lower in the pre-term 
Page 19/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
born. Nevertheless, a benefit of the maternal immunization 
is seen for both groups. 
The data shown for the Pertussis antigens show that the 
maternal immunization results in higher geometric mean 
concentrations (GMCs) in the infants regardless of pre-term 
status and after the primary and booster immunization all 
GMCs are similar regardless of vaccination group. The fold 
increases due to primary immunization are lower in the 
maternally-vaccinated. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

safety concerns.  
C.I.z (type IB) - Update of sections 2 and 4.4 of the

the labeling and package leaflet of medicinal

package leaflet is updated accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH/SOH took the opportunity to 
introduce editorial changes in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5

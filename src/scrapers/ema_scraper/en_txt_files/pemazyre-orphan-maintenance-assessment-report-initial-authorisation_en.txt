2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to diagnose/prevent/treat the condition with the medicinal product containing 
pemigatinib was considered justified based on in vivo data in a model of the condition supporting 
inhibition of tumour growth, and preliminary clinical observations reporting responses in affected 
patients; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of liver 
insufficiency, cholestasis, cholangitis, weight loss and cachexia. Patients with unresectable tumours 
die between 6 and 12 months following diagnosis. Death usually occurs from liver failure or 
infectious complications accompanying the progressive biliary obstruction; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1.5 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Biliary tract cancer (BTC) comprises a heterogeneous group of invasive carcinomas that arise from the 
epithelial lining of the gallbladder and bile ducts, with most being adenocarcinomas (over 90%). They 
are sub classified into anatomical subtypes with specific characteristics. Intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), originates from the biliary tree within the liver, and extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) originates outside of the liver parenchyma; the latter is further subdivided 
into perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA or Klatskin tumour) and distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA). 
Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) arises from the mucosa cells of the gallbladder and is also classified as an 
extrahepatic biliary cancer. BTC is mostly sporadic with genetic, environmental and/or cultural risk 
factors are discussed in the literature. 
The therapeutic indication “Pemazyre monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally 
advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion 
or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy” falls within the 
scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of biliary tract cancer”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed with a positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Please refer to the European Public Assessment Report.

Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Prognosis of biliary tract cancer, especially when metastatic, is dismal. The 5-year survival rate varies 
by stage: 50% for stage I, 30% for stage II, 10% for stage III, and 0% for stage IV (Valle et al 2017. 
Cancer Discov. 2017;7(9): 943–962). 
The COMP acknowledged that the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the 
development of liver insufficiency, cholestasis, cholangitis, weight loss and cachexia. Patients with 
unresectable tumours die between 6- and 12 months following diagnosis. Death usually occurs from 
liver failure or infectious complications accompanying the progressive biliary obstruction. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor reviewed literature and registries and approached the issue of prevalence as a sum of the 
patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and number of patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC). The 
COMP acknowledged that appropriate data for estimating the prevalence of the condition would be 
available in the European Cancer Information System (ECIS). 
The following incidence data were first retrieved as a first step of the estimation and reporting of 
prevalence. 
•  GBC: According to the ECIS, there were 7,764 estimated incident cases of GBC in 2020 in the 
27 countries in the EU (EU27).  
•  CCA: According to the ECIS, there were also 60,934 estimated incident cases of liver cancer in 
2020 in the EU27, and the sponsor also referred to a publication by Banales and colleagues 
reporting that CCA comprises approximately 15% of all primary liver tumours (Banales et al. 
Nature reviews Gastroenterology and hepatology, vol 17, September 17, 2020). Based on this, 
an estimate of 9,140 incident cases (60,934*0.15) of CCA in 2020 in the EU27 was estimated. 
As a second step, the duration of the disease was considered on the basis of survival, and the sponsor 
made particular reference to the survival statistics in a publication by Alabraba and co-workers form a 
UK tertiary centre (Alabraba et al, 2019, European Journal of Surgical Oncology, 45, 1660-7). Based 
on that paper, a total number of 12,395 prevalent cases for GBC and 15,413 cases of CCA were 
estimated, yielding a total of 0.62 prevalent cases of BTC per 10,000. 
The COMP considered that in the absence of sensitivity analysis of the used assumptions regarding 
survival and representation of all anatomic subtypes, a more conservative approach would be 
appropriate. It was considered therefore that the ECIS registry would support an incidence of all BTC of 
approximately 1 per 10,000 and the duration of the condition would be approximately 1.5 year for the 
purpose of this exercise. This was also in line with previous procedures of the Committee on the same 
indication. 
It was therefore concluded that the prevalence would be approximately 1.5 per 10,000 at the time of 
maintenance of designation.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Several products are used off-label in the proposed condition: gemcitabine, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, 5-
Fluorouracil (5-FU), carboplatin, mitomycin C, doxorubicin, interferon-alfa 2b, epirubicin, capecitabine, 
irinotecan, docetaxel.  
It is acknowledged that these treatments are not specifically authorised for this condition and that the 
current methods of treatment cannot be considered satisfactory.  
There is an ESMO clinical practice guideline for biliary cancer (Valle et al, Ann Oncol (2016) 27 (suppl 
5): v28-v37).  
•  Surgery: radical surgery (with lymphadenectomy) is the only curative treatment of BTC. 
Evidence base is weak for adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy or 
chemotherapy alone). 
• 
First line systemic chemotherapy: the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or 
inoperable disease: Cisplatin/gemcitabine is the reference chemotherapy regimen for patients 
with good performance status (PS; 0-1); oxaliplatin may be substituted for cisplatin where 
there is a concern about renal function, gemcitabine monotherapy may be considered for 
patients with PS 2. 
•  Second line: no established second-line chemotherapy regimen; patients should be encouraged 
to participate in clinical trials. Radiotherapy may be considered in patients with localised 
disease, after first-line chemotherapy. Radioembolisation may be considered in patients with 
inoperable iCCA, usually after first-line chemotherapy. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable, since there are no satisfactory methods currently authorised in the EU for treatment of 
patients with biliary tract cancer. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 01 February 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of biliary tract cancer (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 1.5 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of liver 
insufficiency, cholestasis, cholangitis, weight loss and cachexia. Patients with unresectable tumours 
die between 6- and 12 months following diagnosis. Death usually occurs from liver failure or 
infectious complications accompanying the progressive biliary obstruction; 
EMA/OD/0000039241 
Page 6/7 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition;  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Pemazyre, pemigatinib, for 
Treatment of biliary tract cancer (EU/3/18/2066) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction  
2.1.1.  Problem statement  
Disease or condition 
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is lack of, or inadequate, production of gonadotropins, i.e. follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH), from the pituitary gland and can be caused by a 
primary  defect  in  gonadotropin  secretion  by  the  pituitary  gonadotrophs,  or  from  absent  or  inadequate 
gonadotropin  releasing  hormone  (GnRH)  secretion  by  the  hypothalamus.  This  results  in  insufficient 
testicular  function  and  deficiencies  in  endogenous  testosterone  production  and  spermatogenesis.  When 
gonadotropin deficiency occurs before puberty (prepubertal), puberty is delayed or absent.

Claimed therapeutic indication 
Current indication 
Elonva 100 mcg and 150 mcg has been approved in females, for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). In 
the treatment of women of reproductive age, the dose of Elonva (100 and 150 mcg) is based on weight 
and age.  
Claimed indication 
Based on the final results of the paediatric study P043, the Applicant initially requested for the following 
extension of the indication: 
“Elonva is indicated for the treatment of adolescent males (14 to less than 18 years) with hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism, in combination with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG).” 
The following posology is proposed: 
“Paediatric population 
In the treatment of adolescent males (14 to less than 18 years) with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the 
dose of Elonva is based on body weight. 
For males weighing less than or equal to 60 kg: 100 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 
weeks, followed by concomitant administration of Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG in males weighing 
less than or equal to 60 kg. For patients initiating therapy with 100 micrograms, consider increasing the 
dose if their body weight increases to greater than 60 kg during the course of treatment. 
For  males  weighing  more  than  60  kg:  150  micrograms  of  Elonva  once  every  two  weeks  for  12  weeks, 
followed by concomitant administration of Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG, in males weighing greater 
than 60 kg.” 
Epidemiology  
HH is a very rare condition. It is estimated that the incidence of CHH is 1-10:100,000 live births and 
approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of cases are caused by Kallmann syndrome (KS) and idiopathic HH, 
respectively (Fraietta R et al; Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism revisited. Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2013;68 
Suppl 1:81-8).  
Biologic features 
Male HH is characterized by impaired secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins, FSH, and LH,  
HH  can  be  the  result  of  failed  secretion  of  the  pituitary  gonadotropins,  FSH  and  LH,  by  the  pituitary  or 
absent or inadequate GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus, resulting in insufficient testicular function and 
deficiencies in testosterone and spermatogenesis.  
Typically,  FSH  and  LH  secretion  begins  shortly  before  birth  and  a  neonatal  surge  in  these  hormones  in 
response  to  a  robust  secretion  of  GnRH  from  the  hypothalamus  is  indicative  of  an  intact  and  functional 
hypothalamic pituitary gonadotrope (HPG) axis. Following this neonatal surge in the secretion of GnRH and 
subsequently  of  FSH  and  LH,  GnRH  secretion  from  the  hypothalamus  decreases  to  very  low  levels 
throughout  childhood.  An  initial  event  during  puberty  is  the  increase  in  the  frequency  and  amplitude  of 
pulsatile  GnRH  secretion,  followed  by  the  pulsatile  secretion  of  FSH  (initially)  and  LH  from  pituitary 
gonadotropes, and hence the stimulation of the testes and ultimate development of sexual maturity.

The clinical manifestations of HH depend on the stage of development at which the deficiency occurs (pre- 
or  post-pubertal).  When  the  deficiency  occurs  before  puberty  (prepubertal),  the  pubertal  transition  is 
delayed  or  absent.  The  condition  can  be  congenital  or  acquired  and  can  occur  in  isolation,  idiopathic 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), in association with anosmia/hyposmia, KS, or as part of a multiple 
pituitary hormone deficiency syndrome.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Clinical presentation of hypogonadism at birth is rare, with abnormal genitalia occurring in ~1 in 4,500 live 
births.  Hypogonadism  established  after  birth,  throughout  childhood,  is  usually  inapparent  until  pubertal 
age;  at  this  point,  the  hypogonadal  condition  manifests  as  delayed  puberty.  The  prevalence  of  delayed 
puberty in the general population has not been thoroughly investigated. In this context, it is important to 
note that the current definition of delayed puberty is based on an arbitrary cut-off of 14 years. Using this 
definition,  early  studies  have  found  a  prevalence  of  delayed  puberty  of  <2%  among  boys  in  the  United 
States (Salonia et al, Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2019).  
Management 
Treatment of adolescent males with HH 
Currently, no FSH treatment is approved for adolescent males with HH. 
FSH treatment of adult patients with HH: 
•  RecFSH  has  shown  to  be an  effective  and  safe  drug  for  several  indications  including  adult  male  HH. 
RecFSH (Puregon) is approved for the treatment of deficient spermatogenesis in adult males who are 
infertile due to hormonal insufficiency and is administered concomitantly with hCG for 3 to 4 months 
before  any  improvement  in  spermatogenesis  is  expected.  To  assess  response,  semen  analysis  is 
recommended  4  to  6  months  after  the  start  of  treatment.  If  a  patient  has  not  responded  after  this 
period, combination therapy may be continued for 18 months or longer to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Puregon is to be given at a dose of 450 IU/week preferably divided into 3 doses of 150 IU concomitantly 
with hCG. Although not indicated for use in adolescent males, recFSH has been used to induce puberty 
in adolescent males with HH, while hCG is approved for induction of puberty in adolescent males with 
HH. 
•  RecFSH  Gonal-F  is  approved  for  the  stimulation  of  spermatogenesis  in  men  who  have  congenital  or 
acquired  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  with  concomitant  human  Chorionic  Gonadotropin  (hCG) 
therapy. It is noted that for the lack of LH, hCG is given instead of LH. LH and hCG share the same alfa 
subunit and bind on the Leydig cell receptors, but hCG has half-life of 36 hours, while half live of LH is 
only 30 minutes. Gonal-F should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with 
hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination 
treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months 
may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
The  primary  goal  in  the  treatment  of  adolescent  male  HH  is  to  increase  testosterone  (T)  levels  (either 
through the administration of exogenous T, or by using hCG to stimulate LH receptors on Leydig cells of 
the testes and induce the production of endogenous T from Leydig cells). This leads to a pubertal growth 
spurt and the development of male secondary sexual characteristics. Another important goal is to stimulate 
spermatogenesis  to  support  fertility;  this  requires  treatment  with  FSH  to  stimulate  the  proliferation  and 
maturation of Sertoli cells in the testes, initiated before hCG treatment.  
Historically, boys with HH were given exogenous testosterone to induce the development of male secondary 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 9/75 
 
 
 
 
 
sexual characteristics. However, boys that are not exposed to FSH may miss a critical state of testicular 
development with regard to spermatogenesis.  
Currently, modern treatment protocols for adolescent males with HH use a 3-staged approach:  
- 
- 
- 
a short period of treatment with FSH-only to promote Sertoli cell proliferation and maturation, 
followed  by  treatment  with  a  combination  of  FSH  and  hCG  to  stimulate  Leydig  cell  function  and 
increase T production until testicular volumes attain adult size,  
after which gonadotropin therapy can be stopped and T supplementation can be used to maintain 
male secondary sexual characteristics until fertility is desired.  
This approach allows for both the induction of puberty and maturation of Sertoli cells in early onset HH so 
that spermatogenesis and future fertility are not compromised. 
Inhibin B has been shown to be a useful surrogate for monitoring spermatogenic activity in boys treated 
with hCG when semen analysis is not feasible.  
2.1.2.  About the product  
Elonva, corifollitropin alfa [CFA] is a recombinant gonadotropin, consisting of the α-subunit of human FSH 
and a hybrid subunit composed of the sequence of the α-subunit of human FSH and the carboxy-terminal 
peptide (CTP) part of the α-subunit of hCG. It has the same mechanism of action as FSH, but different 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. A single injection of corifollitropin alfa replaces 7 days of daily 
recombinant FSH injections. Elonva 100 and 150 mcg is approved through centralised procedure 
(EU/1/09/609/001-002) in January 2010 for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS) in combination with a 
Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist for the development of multiple follicles in women 
participating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program.  
Regarding the currently requested indication in adolescents with HH, the Applicant claimed that since 
treatment of HH in males usually requires long-term FSH treatment, the use of CFA may result in fewer 
medication errors and improved compliance. Both CFA and recFSH act at the same FSH receptor in the 
ovary or testes, therefore either can be used for gonadal stimulation. However, it is noted that currently 
the recFSH is not approved for treatment of adolescent males with HH, but only in adult patients with HH. 
CFA has been approved in females for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in 69 countries since 2010. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice  
The MAH stated that Study P043:MK8962, “A Phase III, Multi-Center, Open Label, Single-Group Trial to 
Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of MK-8962 (corifollitropin alfa) in Combination with human Chorionic 
Gonadotropin (hCG) for Initiation or Restoration of Puberty as Assessed by Increased Testicular Volume in 
Adolescent Males 14 to <18 Years Old with Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (MK-8962-043)”, is part of 
an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for corifollitropin alfa (CFA) in the European Union (EU); EMEA-
000306PIP01-08-M04 (decision P/0143/2019).  
The original PIP was issued in December 2008 and a PIP modification was agreed upon by the Paediatric 
Committee  (PDCO)  in  August  2011  to  extend  the  timelines  for  the  planned  clinical  study.  The  PIP  was 
modified in December 2013 to include two sequential, open-label, non-comparative studies (one in adult 
men with HH and then one in adolescent males with HH), instead of a single two-staged study, primarily to 
facilitate better execution of the studies. This modified PIP was approved by the PDCO in May 2014. 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 10/75 
 
 
 
 
 
One  of  the  modified  studies  was  Study  P031,  an  “open-label,  non-comparative,  multi-centre  safety  and 
efficacy  study  of  corifollitropin  alfa  (CFA)  in  association  with  hCG  in  male  adults  with  hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism  (HH)”  and  included  18  adult  males.  CFA  use  resulted  in  doubling  of  the  mean  testicular 
volume and induction of spermatogenesis in 77% of adult males who remained azoospermic after treatment 
with hCG. The dose used in Study P031 was based on the results from Study P022, a “Phase 1, open-label, 
repeated  single  dose,  multicenter  PK  study  in  adult  males  with  HH”  and  was  in  general  adequately 
substantiated. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The Applicant stated that the submitted studies were in compliance with GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects  
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction  
GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC (Table 1). 
Table 1 Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
This extension of indication to adolescent males with HH is based on the following clinical studies: 
Study P022 (also known as study 38801) was an open label repeated single dose study in healthy adult 
men (incorrectly indicated as HH males in Table 2 below). Four single dose SC injections of 15 µg were 
given with 4 weeks interval.  
Study P022 was already submitted in support of the currently registered indication in women and is not 
included in the current submission.  
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 11/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study P031, a Phase 3 study, assessed PK, PD, efficacy, and safety of corifollitropin alfa (CFA, Elonva®, 
MK-8962) in combination with hCG in azoospermic adult men with HH. The dose to be used in study P043 
was based on studies P022 and P031. CFA was administered at 150 µg once every 2 weeks. 
Study P043 was a Phase 3, single-group, open-label efficacy and safety study in adolescent males (14 to 
less than 18 years of age) with HH. In this study, CFA was administered alone (once every 2 weeks) for 
the first 12 weeks and in combination with hCG (twice weekly) for the following 52 weeks. The dose of CFA 
is based on weight, and a single dose of 100 μg (body weight ≤60 kg) or 150 μg (body weight >60 kg) was 
administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall once every 2 weeks in the morning on the same day of 
the week. This dosing regimen was selected based on population PK modeling of the results of studies P022 
and P031. 
The extension of the indication to adolescent males was supported by 2 Pop PK studies. At first, a Pop PK 
analysis  was  performed  in  adult  males  with  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  (HH),  based  on  a  Phase  1 
study in healthy adult men (study P022, also indicated as study 38801) and a Phase 3 study in azoospermic 
adult men with HH (study P031). Subsequently, the model in adult males was extended with data from a 
Phase 3 study in adolescent males with HH (study P043). An overview of the studies included in the Pop PK 
analyses is shown in Table 2. 
Table 2 Overview of studies included in population PK analysis 
2.3.2.1 Paediatric PK/PD study P043  
In study P043, a total of 17 male adolescents were allocated to CFA (priming period) for 12 weeks followed 
by combined treatment with CFA and hCG for 52 weeks. A total of 16 subjects completed the combined 
treatment period; 1 subject discontinued because of adverse effects. Subjects weighing ≤60 kg received a 
dose of 100 µg and subjects weighing > 60 kg received a dose of 150 µg. Body weight was ≤60 kg for 11

in study P043 was performed pre-dose and at 6-24 h, 32-52 h, 72-120 h, 144-192 h, and 216-264 h after 
the first dose and pre-dose before 7th and 13th day and in week 12, 24, 36, 48 and 64 and at > 7 days after 
discontinuation.  In  2  participants,  the  dose  of  CFA  was  increased  per  protocol  from  100  to  150  µg.  The 
majority of participants received CFA for ≥ 52 weeks (n=16); 1 participant received CFA for ‘>36 weeks to 
48 weeks’. The results from PK measurements in study P043 are shown in Table 3 below.

Adolescent Males 14 to <18 Years Old with HH (study P043) 
No comparison was made between the groups receiving 100 µg and 150 µg.  
No PK parameters such as AUC, Cmax and Cmin were calculated in study P043 using non-compartmental 
methods.  
Mean pre-dose (trough) CFA serum concentrations ranged from 301 ng/L to 864 ng/L and were generally 
similar.  After  repeated  dosing  with  CFA  alone  and  co-administered  with  hCG,  mean  and  median 
concentrations at visit 8 and 9 (CFA alone), respectively, were similar to concentrations at visits 11-13 (CFA 
+ hCG). CFA serum concentrations appeared comparable in participants with body weights ≤60 kg receiving 
100 µg doses of CFA and participants with body weights >60 kg receiving 150 µg doses of CFA based on 
non-summarized, individual data. 
2.3.2.2 POP PK modeling in adult men  
The objectives of the analyses were to: 
•  Develop Population PK model for Elonva (MK-8962) in male patients in order to: 
o  Obtain individual exposure estimates for patients in study P031 to support exploratory 
PKPD evaluations 
o  Enable simulations of PK in adolescent male patients for different Elonva regimens 
• 
Explore PK-PD relationships for endpoints of interest, specifically testicular volume and sperm 
count 
•  Assess what doses of MK-8962 would produce drug exposure above FSH-IR level of 4 IU/L 
The population PK analysis in adult males included available CFA concentration-time data from studies 
P022 and P031. Additionally, FSH immunoreactivity (FSH-IR) data were included from study P031. In 
study P022, PK sampling was performed after the 1st and 3rd dose: pre-dose and 
1,2,4,6,8,10,16,24,30,36,48,72, 96,144,192,240,288 and 336 h post-dose. In study P031, PK sampling 
was performed pre-dose and at 6-24, 32-52, 96, 168 and 240 h after the first dose, and pre-dose before 
the 3rd, 9th, 15th and 21st injection and at endpoint and follow up. FSH-IR samples were collected pre-
dose every 4 weeks. The PK/PD dataset included available testicular volume, sperm count, testosterone 
and estradiol observations from study P031 to support exploration of potential associations.

For the modeling and simulation pertinent to this application, data on CFA PK in males were considered 
and based upon historical experience with Puregon (recombinant FSH which is approved for use in adult 
males), serum trough FSH immunoreactivity (FSH-IR) ≥ 4 IU/L was selected as the criteria to obtain the 
target exposure in adolescent male HH patients. Notably, cross reactivity of the FSH assay to CFA is 
known to occur owing to the structural similarity of CFA and FSH. Consequently, the historical population 
PK models have jointly described FSH and CFA kinetics and output pharmacokinetic targets expressed as 
FSH-IR. To this end, any target FSH-IR reflected endogenous FSH and CFA concentrations and not 
endogenous FSH alone.  
CFA and FSH-IR were analysed using a non-linear mixed effects model. The starting point was the 
existing Pop PK model in females. In this model, pharmacokinetics were described using a one-
compartment model with first order absorption from the subcutaneous depot and first order elimination. 
The model in females included also endogenous FSH. Endogenous FSH was however removed from the 
model because no measurable FSH is present prior to treatment in the HH male population. All original 
covariates were removed from the model, as they may not apply in a male population. FSH concentration 
data were integrated into the previous analysis by estimating a scaling factor between FSH and CFA 
concentrations. A scaling factor was estimated to scale between MK-8962 and FSH-IR concentration 
measurements. Based on the experience in women, body weight was planned to be tested as a covariate 
on CL and V a priori. Graphical exploration was then used to assess any remaining relationships between 
CFA PK parameters and the covariates age and BMI. A formulation component was also included to 
account for the use of different formulations between the two studies (non-protein free in study P022 and 
protein-free in study P031). 
To quantify the impact of body weight on CFA and FSH-IR exposure, two types of simulations were 
performed: 
•  Deterministic simulation, in which AUCss values were calculated for MK-8962 and FSH-IR, based 
on the final model estimates for CL and any potential effect of body weight, given a range of 
Elonva doses for a range of body weights. 
•  Stochastic simulation, in which individual estimates of AUCss and Cmin for MK- 8962 and FSH-IR 
were predicted at CFA doses of 100 µg and 150 µg once every two weeks for 1000 adolescent 
male patients aged from 14 to 18. 
The simulations from the population PK model were subsequently used to explore the resulting exposure 
values obtained with different CFA doses in male patients of different body weight. Key assumptions that 
are implied in these simulations are:  
1.  Apart from the body weight effect on clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V), the PK and 
PD are the same in adolescent and adult HH male patients; 
2.  CFA has similar PD compared to Puregon (recFSH) in HH male population; 
3.  Serum FSH-IR levels after treatment with CFA should be at least as high as after treatment with 
2x225 IU or 3x150 IU Puregon per week. As treatment with 2x 225 IU or 3x150 IU Puregon per 
week resulted in a pre-dose value ≥ 4 IU/L (nadir), a trough FSH immunoreactivity levels ≥ 4 
IU/L was selected as a criteria to select the dose and interval for adolescent males. 
Data programming was conducted in SAS v 9.3. Population PK analysis was conducted in NONMEM v 7.2. 
Post processing of Pop PK analysis results as well as the complete PK-PD evaluation were conducted in R-
Studio using R version 2.15.2.

A total of 31 patients were included in the dataset for Pop PK analysis, 13 subjects from study P022 and 
18 subjects from study P031. Three patients from study P022 were excluded because measurable CFA 
concentrations were present prior to treatment and these patients had elevated concentrations 
throughout the study. Furthermore, concentrations below the LLOQ were set to zero. The resulting 
dataset consisted of a total of 431 CFA concentrations and 229 FSH IR concentrations. 
The final model was a one-compartment model with first order absorption. Body weight was added as a 
covariate on CL and V. Other covariates age and BMI were evaluated based on ETA estimates (see Figure 
1).

Parameter estimates for the final model are presented in Table 4. All fixed effect parameters, including 
the body weight effect, were estimated with relatively high precision. Goodness of fit plots are shown in 
Figure 2. The estimated relative bioavailability fraction accounting for formulation differences (26%, see 
Table 4) was consistent with the difference in exposure observed in a direct comparison between the 
protein-free and non-protein-free formulations in study P022 (AUC 20% higher for protein-free).

Simulations 
In order to obtain a summary of individual MK-8962 exposure estimates, a simulation was conducted in 
which individual PK profiles for study P031 were predicted on the basis of the individual post-hoc 
parameter estimates. From these predicted profiles, non-compartmental PK parameter estimates were 
derived. These are summarized in Table 5. 
Table 5 Estimated CFA PK parameters in adult males 
Additional simulations were performed to predict typical CFA AUC, typical FSH-IR trough concentrations 
as well as FSH-IR PK profiles in adolescent male patients for a range of body weight values and CFA 
doses. The simulation results are presented in Table 6 and Figure 4 and Figure 5 for a restricted set of 
body weight values and CFA doses. Results indicate that the majority of the population will achieve CFA 
exposure near the target AUC of 1200 ng.h/mL.

In high body weight patients (> 100 kg) however, CFA exposure would be predicted to remain below this 
target value.

MK-8962 in different body weight groups for adolescents (FSH-IR of 4IU/L labeled as a 
horizontal dashed line) based on model in adult males 
Simulations using the population PK model demonstrate that trough serum FSH-IR levels are expected to 
remain above 4 IU/L when adolescent males are treated once every two weeks with either 100 µg (for a 
body weight of ≤60 kg) or 150 µg (for a body weight of >60 to 100 kg) of CFA. When treating adolescent 
males weighing >100 kg, 150 µg CFA every two weeks may result in a trough serum FSH-IR level slightly 
below 4 IU/L in the majority of subjects. These results were the basis for the dose selected for study P043. 
A threshold above which efficacy is expected is mentioned as 4 IU/L for FSH-IR. This is based on the 
trough concentration to recFSH (Puregon).   
Reference  was  provided  describing  the  model  on  which  the  estimation  of  the  exposure  to  Puregon  was 
based upon (publication Rose et al, 2016). There are some uncertainties with the derivation of the target 
exposure, such as product differences (recFSH and Puregon vs Elonva), differences between populations 
(the literature models are based on women instead of men and a different indication), and differences in 
study conditions (e.g. single dose versus steady state, etc.), which result in uncertainties on the derived 
target  exposure. There  are  no  clinically  relevant  consequences  (e.g.  different  posology  or  indication 
consequences) associated with the proposed target exposure. The data indicated no relationship between 
exposure and clinical measures. Nonetheless, Elonva was considered to be effective, which indicates that 
the exposure to Elonva is rather high. Additionally, the current posology did not translate into limiting safety 
risks.  
In the prior model in women, pharmacokinetics were reported to be described using a one-compartment 
model with first order absorption from the subcutaneous depot and first order elimination. The final model 
in men was the same basic model with some minor adaptations. It is agreed that endogenous FSH was 
removed from the model. The situation that no measurable FSH is present prior to treatment, would not 
account for healthy men, but can be assumed for the patient population. 
Clearance, volume of distribution, Ka, relative bioavailability, scaling factor, effect of body weight on CL 
and V, and proportional error of CFA and FSH-IR were estimated with high precision (RSE 6 – 16%). 
Interindividual variation in CL, V and Ka was estimated with somewhat higher RSE (34 – 37%). Goodness

of fit plots showed adequate fit. Visual predictive check showed sufficient fit, except that the variability 
was somewhat higher in the predicted values compared to the observed values.  
Comparable exposure is observed in groups weighing 30 – 60 kg receiving 100 µg on the one hand, and 
groups weighing 60 – 100 kg receiving 150 µg on the other hand. Mean and approximately the 25th and 
75th percentile of FSH-IR are expected to remain above the threshold of 4 IU/L. In adolescent males 
weighing >100 kg, 150 µg CFA every two weeks may result in a trough serum FSH-IR level slightly below 
4 IU/L in the majority of subjects. Considering the lack of an exposure-efficacy relationship, this is not 
expected to be clinically relevant. 
2.3.2.3. POP PK- modeling in adolescent males  
The population PK in adolescent males is based on the model in adult men, as described above. The data 
from study P043 were combined with the previously available data in adult men. Pre-dose concentrations 
above the LLOQ, measurements below the LLOQ and missing values were reported to have been excluded 
from the analysis.  
Objectives of the analyses were: 
•  Update the prior CFA population PK model, based upon adult male data, to adequately describe the 
PK of CFA in adolescent males being treated for HH. 
•  Analyze the effects of intrinsic factors such as body weight, age, and height. 
•  Characterize the PK parameters Cmax, Cmin, AUC, CL and V of CFA in study P043, a clinical study 
in adolescent males. 
CFA  plasma  concentration-time  data  were  analyzed  using  a  nonlinear-mixed  effects  modeling  approach. 
Endogenous FSH levels in males with HH are negligible. In study P043, only adolescent males with FSH < 
2 IU/L were enrolled.  
Time matched CFA and FSH concentrations were visualized stratified by study. Assessment indicated that 
the  relation  was  highly  significant  for  study  P031,  while  there  was  no  clear  discernible  relation  in  study 
P043. Based on this observation, it was concluded that it was not scientifically appropriate to use a linear 
scaling factor to describe CFA concentrations in terms of FSH immunoreactivity as had been done in the 
adult male HH model. Also, the futility of the FSH/CFA interrelation in study P043 precluded the estimation 
of separate scaling factors by study. Apparently different FSH assays were used with a different level of 
cross-reactivity of the FSH assay for CFA in the two HH male patient studies. 
The  FSH  concentrations  and  scaling  factor  were  therefore  removed  from  the  model.  Body  weight  was 
retained  as  a  covariate.  Other  potential  covariates  (age,  BMI,  height)  were  investigated  using  graphical 
exploration followed by linear regression (continuous covariates) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing.  
Data programming was conducted in SAS v 9.3. Population PK analysis was conducted in NONMEM 7.4.3. 
run on a grid of Intel Xeon servers running the CentOS 7 Linux with Open Grid Scheduler, GNU Fortran 
Compiler (Version 4.8.5), and Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN, version 4.8.1). Post processing of population PK 
analysis results was conducted in R-Studio version 1.3. using R version 4.0.2. 
Results 
In total, 43 males were included in the population PK dataset, 10 subjects from study P022, 16 subjects 
from study P031, and 17 subjects from study P043. The final analysis dataset consisted of a total of 565 
CFA concentrations, 267 from healthy adult males, 164 from adult males with HH, and 134 from adolescent 
males with HH. Since in three subjects from study P022, measurable CFA concentrations were present prior 
to treatment, and these subjects had elevated concentrations throughout the study, these subjects were

excluded from the analysis in agreement with the previous model. Also, samples with measurable pre-dose 
from trials P031 and P043 were excluded, one from each study.  
The final model was a one-compartment model with first order absorption. As mentioned above, the scaling 
factor between CFA and FSH was removed from the model. The relative bioavailability parameter to account 
for the use of different formulations between the studies P022 (non-protein free formulation) on the one 
hand and P031 and P043 (protein-free commercial formulation) on the other hand, was retained. Effect of 
body weight on central volume of distribution and clearance was fixed to 1 and 0.75 respectively (estimates 
in run215 [run previously to the final run] were 1.2 with RSE 15.3% and 0.76 with RSE 23.2% respectively). 
This  was  reported  to  be  in  agreement  with  literature  (no  reference  provided).  Graphical  exploration  of 
covariates is shown in Figure 6. No additional covariates were included.

Table 9 Predicted CFA AUCss and Cmin values for different combinations of CFA dose and body 
weight based on model including adolescent males 
The Pop PK model showed a good fit in both adult men and adolescents. 
Ka, volume of distribution, clearance, relative bioavailability and proportional error of CFA were estimated 
with high precision (RSE 5 – 12%). Interindividual variation in CL, V and Ka was estimated with somewhat 
higher RSE (28 – 41%). Goodness of fit plots and VPC showed good fit except for somewhat higher predicted 
variability than observed.  
Estimated V 32 L and CL 0.22 L/h for the model including adult and adolescent males were similar to those 
in adult men alone (V 35 L and CL 0.20 L/h).  
When  simulated  PK  parameters  for  adolescents  (subjects  in  study  P043)  are  compared  to  simulated 
parameters  for  adult  men  (arithmetic  mean)  (based  on  studies  P022  and  P031),  Cmax  is  comparable 
between adolescents and adult men (6.5 ng/mL vs 5.7 ng/mL), which also goes for AUCss (949 ng.h/mL 
vs 1013 ng.h/mL). Average estimated Cmin is 40% lower for adolescents than for adult men (0.65 ng/mL 
vs  1.1  ng/mL).  The  lack  of  a  relationship  between  exposure  and  testicular  volume  indicates  that  the 
difference in Cmin between adolescents and adults (0.65 ng/mL vs 1.1 ng/mL) is not expected to cause a 
difference in efficacy. 
AUCss  and  Cmin  were  comparable  between  both  paediatric  dose  groups.  As  in  adult  men,  exposure  is 
expected  to  be  lower  when  body  weight  exceeds  100  kg.  Considering  the  lack  of  an  exposure-efficacy 
relationship, this is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
No actually measured pharmacokinetic data were provided. No non-compartmental analysis was performed 
because of the relatively sparse PK sampling that was performed in the studies. The visual predictive check 
indicates that the Pop PK model has an acceptable fit: in general, all observations were within the predicted 
area.  
Three subjects from study P022 were excluded from the Pop PK analyses of both studies P031 and P043, 
because they had measurable CFA concentrations prior to treatment. Two subjects from study P031 were 
removed from the Pop PK analysis based on adult + adolescent subjects, but not from the Pop PK analysis 
based on adult subjects only. This because in the analysis based on adult + adolescent subjects, only CFA 
concentrations were used, whereas only FSH-IR concentrations (no CFA concentrations) were available for 
these subjects, which is agreed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
Mechanism of action 
CFA  has  been  shown  to  have  the  same  pharmacodynamic  profile  as  (rec)FSH,  but  with  a  markedly 
prolonged duration of FSH activity. In women CFA has been shown to initiate and sustain multiple follicular 
growth for an entire week, therefore a single subcutaneous injection of the recommended dose of CFA could 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 25/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
replace the first seven injections of any daily (rec)FSH preparation in a controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) 
treatment cycle. The long duration of FSH activity was achieved by adding the carboxy-terminal peptide of 
the β-subunit of hCG to the β-chain of human FSH. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No separate pharmacodynamic data have been submitted within the dossier. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling  
An exploration of potential PK-PD correlations for testicular volume is presented in Figure 11, based on data 
from studies P022 and P031. There appear to be no clear relationships between testicular volume and MK-
8962  AUC,  neither  when  looking  at  the  average  testicular  volume  (or  change  from  baseline)  over  the 
complete treatment period, or after Day 150. Also, as indicated by the confidence intervals of the regression 
lines including a horizontal (flat) line, no significant linear relationships were identified for any of the four 
TV measures. 
Figure 11 PK-PD correlations for testicular volume  
Figure 12 presents the results of exploratory logistic regression analyses for sperm count response (defined 
as  any  sperm  count  observation  >  1·106  in  a  subject).  When  based  on  all  data  across  the  complete 
treatment period, a trend for increased response with increasing AUC is apparent. However, this trend does

not reach statistical significance (p-value 0.132). When restricted to the first 200 days of treatment, no 
trend for a relationship is seen.

There were insufficient data to establish reliable PK-PD relationships. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
The Pop PK model showed a good fit in both adult men and adolescents.  
A threshold above which efficacy is expected is mentioned as 4 IU/L for FSH-IR. This is based on the trough 
concentration to recFSH (Puregon). Reference was provided describing the model on which the estimation 
of the exposure to Puregon was based (publication Rose et al, 2016). There are some uncertainties with 
the  derivation  of  the  target  exposure,  such  as  product  differences  (recFSH  and  Puregon  vs  Elonva), 
differences between populations (the literature models are based on women instead of men and a different 
indication), and differences in study conditions (e.g. single dose versus steady state, etc.), which result in 
uncertainties  around  the  derived  target  exposure. There  are  no  clinically  relevant  consequences  (e.g. 
different  posology  or  indication  consequences)  associated  with  the  proposed  target  exposure.  The  data 
indicated no relationship between exposure and clinical measures. Nonetheless, Elonva was considered to 
be effective, which indicates that the exposure to Elonva is rather high. Additionally, the current posology 
did not translate into limiting safety risks. Therefore, this issue will not be further pursued. 
When  simulated  PK  parameters  for  adolescents  (subjects  in  study  P043)  are  compared  to  simulated 
parameters for adult men (arithmetic mean) (based on studies P022 and P031), Cmax is comparable between 
adolescents and adult men (6.5 ng/mL vs 5.7 ng/mL), which also goes for AUCss (949 ng.h/mL vs 1013 
ng.h/mL).  Average  estimated  Cmin  is  40%  lower  for  adolescents  than  for  adult  men  (0.65  ng/mL  vs  1.1 
ng/mL). The lack of a relationship between exposure and testicular volume indicates that the difference in 
Cmin between adolescents and adults (0.65 ng/mL vs 1.1 ng/mL) is not expected to cause a difference in 
efficacy.  
AUCss  and  Cmin  were  comparable  between  both  paediatric  dose  groups.  As  in  adult  men,  exposure  is 
expected  to  be  lower  when  body  weight  exceeds  100  kg.  Considering  the  lack  of  an  exposure-efficacy 
relationship, this is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
No actually measured pharmacokinetic data were provided. No non-compartmental analysis was performed 
because of the relatively sparse PK sampling that was performed in the studies. The visual predictive check 
indicates that the Pop PK model has an acceptable fit: in general, all observations were within the predicted 
area.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
The proposed indication can be accepted from a pharmacokinetic point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy  
Study P043 
This  clinical  overview  summarizes  results  from  a  global,  Phase  3,  single-group,  open-label  efficacy  and 
safety study of corifollitropin alfa (CFA, Elonva®, MK 8962) in combination with hCG for the treatment of 
HH in adolescent males (14 to less than 18 years of age) (study P043). In this study, CFA was administered 
alone for the first 12 weeks and in combination with hCG for the following 52 weeks.  
Study P031 
Additionally, this clinical overview references results from a Phase 3 study (study P031) that assessed PK, 
PD, efficacy, and safety of CFA in combination with hCG in azoospermic adult men with HH. The PK and PD 
results from study P031 were used to select the dose of CFA to be used in adolescent males in study P043.  
Study P043 was earlier submitted and assessed within the Article 46 procedure EMEA/H/C/ 
001106/P46/019.

Study P043 
Study  P043  was  a  phase  III,  multi-centre,  open  label,  single-group  trial  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and 
safety of MK-8962 (corifollitropin alfa) in combination with hCG for initiation or restoration of puberty as 
assessed by increased testicular volume in adolescent males 14 to <18 years old with HH. 
The  study  protocol  and  study  results  of  P043  were  earlier  assessed  and  agreed  within  the  Article  46 
procedure EMEA/H/C/ 001106/P46/019. 
Further, the protocol of Study P043 has been agreed upon in the PIP for CFA (PIP decision: P/0143/2019).  
Methods 
Study design 
This was a multi-centre, open-label, single-group study evaluating the treatment of corifollitropin alfa (MK-
8962) in combination with hCG (500 to 5000 IU) sc given twice weekly to induce and/or restore puberty 
and induce and/or restore spermatogenesis in adolescent males with HH.

The study included a screening period, priming period with CFA, combined treatment period with CFA and 
hCG for 52 weeks, and a follow-up visit. Each subject participated in the trial for approximately 73 weeks 
from the time the subject signs the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact.  
The study design diagram is presented in Figure 13. 
Figure 133 Study design diagram  
After a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, each subject was treated for 12 weeks with MK-8962 alone (i.e., 
priming phase).  
The  rationale  for  the  priming  period  with  CFA  instead  of  hCG  in  adolescents  with  HH  was  to  mimic  the 
gonadotropin  pattern  of  normal  puberty,  stimulating  FSH  receptors  on  Sertoli  cells  with  CFA  prior  to 
stimulation  of  LH  receptors  on  Leydig  cells  with  hCG,  to  induce  testicular  growth,  masculinization,  and 
preservation of future fertility in these participants. This approach was supported by evidence of successful 
induction of testicular growth and fertility with recFSH pre-treatment followed by GnRH therapy in men with 
CHH and prepubertal testes (Dwyer AA et al; J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2013;98:E1790-E1795). 
After completion of the Priming Phase, the subject started on combined treatment with both MK-8962 and 
hCG for 52 weeks. At the end of the combined treatment phase or at premature discontinuation, a post-
treatment follow-up visit was scheduled at least 21 days after the last MK-8962 injection (and at least 7 
days  after  the  last  hCG  injection).  After  the  post-treatment  follow-up  visit,  subjects  who  prematurely 
discontinued  study  medication  but  did  not  withdraw  consent  continued  to  be  followed  up  until  they  had 
reached Week 64 after initial treatment allocation.  
Subjects discontinued from the treatment due to the presence of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
may continue to be followed until the ADA result becomes negative or until clinically stable for up to 12 
months after treatment discontinuation. 
Although the study design has been agreed within the Article 46 procedure EMEA/H/C/ 001106/P46/019 
the open label design with no randomisation in a small heterogeneous population provides very limited data 
in support of this sequential treatment regime (CFA + CFA/HCG) in prepubertal adolescents. HH is a rare 
condition  and  the  challenges  to  recruitment  are  acknowledged.  Ideally  a  randomized  controlled  study

comparing  different  treatment  approaches  i.e.  sequential  vs  combined  treatment)  would  have  been 
conducted to properly evaluate the effect of peripubertal priming on future spermatogenesis. The optimality 
of the treatment paradigm (CFA + CFA/HCG) has been sufficiently discussed with reference to published 
literature and clinical guidelines.  
Duration of treatment  
The total duration of the study was 73 weeks, the active treatment period was 64 weeks. 
Study participants 
A total of 17 male adolescents were allocated to CFA (priming period) for 12 weeks and combined treatment 
with CFA and hCG for 52 weeks. 
Adolescent male participants who met the following key criteria were eligible to participate in the study: 
Inclusion Criteria 
1.  14 to <18 years of age at the time when consent/assent was signed, with treatment to begin before 
the subject’s 18th birthday. 
2.  Diagnosis  of  HH  (either  isolated  or  associated  with  panhypopituitarism),  either  congenital  or 
acquired with onset before puberty.  
Note:  Subjects  with  drug-induced  HH  (e.g.,  misuse  of  anabolic  steroids,  chronic  use  of 
glucocorticoids or narcotic analgesics, etc.) are excluded. 
3.  Bilateral  pre-gonadarche  testes  as  defined  by  testicular  volume  <4.0  mL  for  each  testicle,  as 
determined by ultrasound and assessed by a qualified investigator (if qualified) or local radiologist 
with appropriate training and expertise in reading testicular ultrasound.  
Note: subjects with a volume of <4.0 mL in one testicle and a volume of 4-8 mL in the other testicle 
are considered to be pre-gonadarche and may participate, if there is no history or evidence of a 
primary testicular disorder (see exclusion criteria 1 and 2). 
4.  Circulating levels of Total T less than the LLN of 8.3 nmol/L as specified by the central laboratory 
for a young healthy adult male. 
5.  FSH ≤2 IU/L and LH ≤2 IU/L. 
6.  Inhibin B levels ≤35 pg/mL. Note: if the subject has inhibin B levels >35 pg/mL and meets all of 
the other inclusion/exclusion criteria, either a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) stimulation test or GnRH IV 
infusion test may be performed. The subject may be enrolled if either of the following is met: 
1)  GnRH agonist (GnRHa) stimulation test: LH level of <3 IU/L at all of the following time points: 
0, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after subcutaneous administration of a GnRH agonist, eg., 500 μg 
of leuprolide acetate. 
2)  GnRH IV infusion test: LH peak <5.8 IU/L and FSH peak <4.6 IU/L at all of the following time 
points: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 minutes during intravenous infusion of GnRH 100 micrograms 
over 120 minutes. 
Exclusion Criteria 
1.  History of bilateral cryptorchidism (maldescended testes) or unilateral cryptorchidism treated after 
the age of 2 years. 
2.  History or presence of clinically significant testicular problems (e.g., epididymitis, orchitis, testicular 
torsion, varicocele Grade III, testicular atrophy, occlusive azoospermia, etc) that in the opinion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 30/75 
 
 
 
 
 
the  investigator  would  impair  the  subject’s  response  to  treatment  or  has  had  known  damage  or 
injury to the vas deferens. 
3.  Previous treatment with GnRH, gonadotropins (e.g., hCG, FSH) or androgens (e.g., T, etc.).  
Note: Use of GnRH and gonadotropins for diagnostic testing purposes only was allowed. Subjects 
with use of hCG and androgen therapy before 2 years old could have been included in the study. 
Subjects with transient use of androgens (i.e., for less than 2 weeks) that was stopped at least 6 
months before signing informed consent could have also been included in the trial. 
4.  Untreated or inadequately treated pituitary or hypothalamic tumour. 
5.  Uncontrolled  endocrinopathies,  including  thyroid,  adrenal,  and  pituitary  disorders  not  on  stable 
replacement therapies (i.e., subject has not been on stable doses for at least 3 months).  
Note: The subject with a free T4 level outside the normal laboratory range at the time of screening 
was excluded but may have been rescreened once he had been on a stable dose of replacement 
therapies for at least 3 months. 
6.  History of active pituitary hypersecretion as evidenced by hyperprolactinemia or Cushing’s disease, 
or acromegaly, or any other active pituitary hypersecretion syndrome. Note: Subjects were treated 
and are clinically stable, with no evidence of hypersecretion for at least 12 months before screening, 
may have participated. 
7.  Hypophysectomy within a period of 12 months before the start of screening. 
8.  Had an allergy/sensitivity to gonadotropins or its/their excipients. 
This study excluded boys who had previously received GnRH, gonadotropins or testosterone treatment. For 
pubertal induction, testosterone is currently a recommended treatment among paediatric endocrinologists 
(Boehm 2015).1 There is limited information regarding the effect of this treatment regimen on patients who 
have already been commenced on testosterone or any gonadotropin or GnRH treatment. Wording on this 
effect has been included in the final agreed wording for section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

Treatments 
The study medications are outlined in the table below. 
The participant and his legal guardian (or someone designated by the participant’s legal guardian such as 
a caregiver or parent) were instructed at Visit 2 on home-administration of CFA injections. The first 3 
doses of CFA were administered by the participant at the trial site on V2/Day 1, Visit 7 (V7)/Week 2 (Day 
15), and Visit 8 (V8)/Week 4 (Day 29) as witnessed doses. Later injections were self-administered by the 
participant or administered by the participant’s legal guardian (or the designated person who had been 
appropriately trained) at home. 
At Visit 9 (V9)/Week 12 (Day 85), the subject entered a 52-week MK-8962 and hCG combined treatment 
phase. The first dose of hCG was self-administered (or administered by an appropriately trained person 
designated by the subject’s legal guardian) at the trial site as a witnessed dose at V9. During the 
combined treatment phase, the subject had site visits every 8 to 12 weeks from V9 until treatment 
completion at Visit 15 (V15)/Week 64. 
Dose of MK-8962 
Subjects with body weight ≤60 kg were given MK-8962 100 μg and subjects with body weight >60 kg 
were given MK-8962 150 μg. During the course of the trial, for subjects receiving MK-8962 100 μg, the 
dose of MK-8962 should be adjusted to 150 μg if the subject’s body weight increases by 2 kg or more 
from the previous visit to a value greater than 60 kg. For subjects receiving MK-8962 150 μg, the dose 
should not be down-titrated for the rest of the trial regardless of any changes in body weight. 
Dose titration for hCG 
The dose of hCG was adjusted between 500 IU and 5,000 IU (inclusive) in order to keep the Total T and 
E2 levels within the normal ranges as defined in the paragraph below. Blood samples collected at Visit 
9/Week 12 and each of the subsequent visits were evaluated for the Total T and E2 levels. Based on the 
results of these tests, the investigator or qualified designee should log into the Interactive Voice/Web 
Response System (IVRS/IWRS) between pre-specified visits to request additional medication if hCG up-
titration is needed. 
The normal range for Total T for this study is defined as the mean ± 2 standard deviation (SD) for a 
young, healthy male population, and the exact limits are assay-specific. The reference range used by the 
Sponsor-designated central lab is 240.00 – 950.00 ng/dL (or 8.3 – 33.0 nmol/L). 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 32/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During hCG treatment, serum E2 levels should also be evaluated to avoid clinically relevant elevations of 
E2 levels (should be monitored towards maintaining <40% above the upper limit of normal in men [the 
ULN from the Sponsor-designated central laboratory is 40.00 pg/mL] ). 
Table 10 MK-8962 and hCG Dosing Schedule 
Objectives 
The primary objectives are: 
In adolescent males 14 to <18 years old with HH: 
• 
• 
To estimate the change from baseline in testicular volume (measured as the sum of volumes of left 
and right testes by ultrasound) after 64 weeks of treatment with MK-8962 (in combination with hCG 
for the last 52 weeks).  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-8962 over 64 weeks of treatment, including evaluation 
of development of antibodies to MK-8962. 
The secondary objectives are: 
In adolescent males 14 to <18 years old with HH, to evaluate the following parameters over 64 weeks of 
treatment with MK-8962 (in combination with hCG for the last 52 weeks): 
•  Change from baseline in Tanner Stage of pubertal development.  
•  Growth velocity (height).  
•  Change from baseline in inhibin B concentrations.  
•  Change from baseline in levels of endocrine parameters (i.e., LH, calculated free T, Total T, estradiol 
[E2], SHBG, and AMH).  
• 
• 
Testicular sonographic pattern reflecting pubertal development.  
PK of MK-8962 (based on serum MK-8962 concentrations). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline (Day 1) to Week 64 in log-transformed testicular volume (measured as the 
sum of volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound).  
Secondary endpoints: 
• 
Tanner Stage of pubertal development at Weeks 12, 36, and 64.  
•  Growth velocity at Weeks 36 and 64.  
•  Change from baseline in serum inhibin B concentrations at Week 64.  
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 33/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Changes from baseline in endocrine parameters LH, Total T, T, E2, SHBG, and AMH at Weeks 12, 36, 
and 64.  
•  Characterization of testicular sonographic pattern reflecting pubertal development through 64 weeks 
of treatment.  
•  Characterization of MK-8962 PK (based on serum MK-8962 concentrations) through 64 weeks of 
treatment. 
Sample size 
This was an estimation study. Approximately 15 subjects were to be enrolled. 
Assuming a screen failure rate of approximately 50-60%, approximately 30-40 subjects were to be 
screened to enrol approximately 15 subjects. Assuming a discontinuation rate of 30%, it was estimated 
that 10 subjects will complete. If the discontinuation rate exceeded 30%, enrolment was to be reopened 
to assure the target number of completers. The total number of enrolled subjects was not to exceed 35. 
Randomisation 
Dispensing of medication and assignment of screening and randomization numbers will be performed via 
the IVRS/IWRS. After signing informed consent, the investigator or qualified designee should enter the 
subject in the IVRS/IWRS and the system will assign a screening number. After evaluation of all screening 
data, indicating that the subject complies with all selection criteria, the subject can be assigned a 
randomization number to enter the MK -8962 priming phase. No stratification based on age, sex or other 
characteristics will be used in this trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis for testicular volume was based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from Day 1 (Baseline) in log-transformed testicular 
volume was analysed using a mixed model with a fixed effect for baseline and time point and a random 
effect for each participant. The geometric mean increase in testicular volume and its 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were obtained by exponentiation.  
The mean change from the first day of combined treatment (Week 12) to Week 64 in log-transformed 
testicular volume was also analysed using a mixed model with a fixed effect for time point. For each time 
point, the mean change from Week 12 to that time point and the associated 95% CI were calculated. The 
geometric mean increase in testicular volume and its 95% CI were obtained by exponentiation.  
The analyses for all secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted on the FAS population.  
The change in serum inhibin B concentrations after Weeks 12, 36, and 64 were summarized. Growth 
velocity over the 36- and 64-week treatment periods was extracted using the slopes estimated from an 
overall mixed random intercept and random slope model of height (cm) and time (in years) and age as 
covariates. Tanner Staging was recorded for both testicular volume and pubic hair at baseline, Weeks 12, 
36, and 64. Serum concentrations of hormones (LH, total T, E2, SHBG, and AMH) were summarized by 
assessment. Sonographic testicular patterns were listed and any changes over time were described.  
The PK analysis was conducted in the All-Subjects-Pharmacokinetically-Evaluable group. Serum CFA 
concentrations were obtained using a solid phase enzyme-immunoassay specific for CFA. Descriptive 
statistics for the serum concentrations by time-point were calculated.

Safety analyses were performed in the ASaT population, which consisted of all randomized participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review 
of relevant endpoints including AEs, presence of MK-8962 antibodies, predefined limits of change 
(PDLCs), laboratory tests, and vital signs. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 25 male participants were screened and 17 were allocated across 9 sites in 4 countries. All 
participants completed the study as per protocol. One participant discontinued study medication due to an 
SAE. All non-randomized participants were screen failures (Table 11). 
Table 11 Disposition of Subjects 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study was conducted in 4 countries, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Russian Federation. Seventeen subjects 
were enrolled in the study. 
Only one patient was recruited from Europe, with the rest of the population recruited outside the EU 
However, since the efficacy and safety analyses are based on a common biological mechanism linking 
treatment to outcome, there is in general no reason to expect that baseline characteristics and findings in 
HH patients differ across geographic regions. This is supported by public literature indicating baseline 
characteristics of the participants in study P043 to be comparable to the baseline characteristics reported 
for adolescent males with HH from EU countries at the start of treatment (Barrio R et al, Fertil Steril.

2007;156:105-11). 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 8 (47.1%) participants had 1 or more important protocol deviations (PD), and 8 participants 
had 1 or more PDs considered clinically important. The majority of clinically important PDs were related to 
Assessment report

study procedures, with failure to perform significant efficacy evaluations, missing LH, FSH or hCG being 
the most common procedural deviations, but the deviations identified in this study are not expected to 
affect the interpretation of safety or efficacy results. A listing of important PDs is presented by 
participant, study site, and clinical importance in Table 13. 
No important protocol deviations were classified as serious GCP compliance issues. The last 3 months of 
the study were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. No protocol deviations associated with the 
pandemic were reported.

Baseline data 
The 17 subjects were recruited in 9 centres in the following countries: Mexico (n=1), Brazil (n=4), Russia 
(n=11) and Italy (n=1). 
Demographic characteristics 
All participants were prepubertal adolescent males with a mean age of 15.5 years, with a mean height of 
161.4 cm, mean testicular volume of 2.2 mL prepubertal levels of FSH, LH, and total T, and Tanner I for 
genital development (with the exception of 1 participant with Tanner II genitalia) and Tanner I, II or III 
pubic hair. 
The demographic data are summarized in the table below.

At baseline study participants had a mean bilateral testicular volume <4.0 mL for each testicle, Total T 
less than the LLN of 8.3 nmol/L and FSH ≤2 IU/L and LH ≤2 IU/L all of which complied with the inclusion 
criteria. 
An inhibin B cut-off of 35 pg/mL was also included in the inclusion criteria. Mean Inhibin B levels at 
baseline were 44.9 ng/L with a median of 25 ng/L but with a range of 11-144. The 2 subjects with a 
baseline inhibin B level >35 ng/L were diagnosed with CHH based on the same pattern of testicular 
growth as patients with levels <35 ng/L. The 3rd patient’s diagnosis remains unclear based on course on 
TV growth. CHH is a heterogeneous disorder and variability in biomarker levels is not unusual and that 
therefore diagnosis might be challenging.

Medical history 
All participants had 1 or more endocrine disorders pertaining to the pituitary gland reported in their 
medical history: 14 had HH without olfaction deficit/olfactive bulb hypoplasia, 1 had CHARGE syndrome, 1 
had KS, and 1 had a HH diagnosis of unknown origin.  
Concomitant medications 
The most frequent prior medications included levothyroxine (47.1%), somatropin (35.3%), 
hydrocortisone (29.4%), and desmopressin (23.5%). The most frequent concomitant medications 
included levothyroxine (52.9%), somatropin (41.2%), hydrocortisone (35.3%), and desmopressin 
(23.5%). These reported concomitant medications were expected in this subject population, given the 
underlying etiology of HH in these participants. 
Compliance 
All participants were 100% compliant (ie, no missed injections) with CFA during the priming period and 
combined treatment period. Although hCG compliance was not specifically collected, an increase in hCG 
levels was observed after Week 12 and maintained throughout the rest of the study. 
Extent of exposure 
All participants received 6 or 7 doses of CFA before starting hCG. During the combined treatment period, 
participants received CFA with 500 to 5000 IU of hCG. In 2 participants, the dose of CFA was increased 
per protocol from 100 to 150 µg. The majority of participants received CFA for ≥52 weeks (n=16), 1 
participant received CFA for ‘>36 weeks to 48 weeks’. 
The mean duration of CFA and HCG was 442 days (range 294 to 462 days) and 352 days (range 210 to 
371 days), respectively (see Table 15 and 16). 
Table 15 Extent of exposure to corifollitropin alfa by dose all subjects as treated (overall 
treatment period) 
Table 16 Extent of exposure to HCG by dose all subjects as treated (combined treatment 
period) 
All participants received 6 or 7 doses of CFA every 2 weeks for 12 weeks before starting hCG (priming 
phase). During the combined treatment period, participants received CFA with 500 to 5000 IU of hCG for 
52 weeks. In 2 participants, the dose of CFA was increased per protocol from 100 to 150 µg based on 
increased body weight.  
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022

One patient received CFA for ‘>36 weeks to 48 weeks’, 12 patients received CFA for ‘>52 to 64 weeks’ 
and four patients were given CFA for ‘>64 weeks’. The mean duration of CFA and hCG was 442 days 
(range 294 to 462 days) and 352 days (range 210 to 371 days), respectively. 
All subjects received at least 12 weeks of CFA prior to starting hCG. Further, most patients were exposed 
for a median duration of 64 weeks. One patient suffered from an AE and discontinued treatment at 42 
weeks and that two patients had shorter treatment duration due to a switch in dose strength from 100 to 
150 μg. It is therefore considered that the duration of CFA was generally 64 weeks and that the divergent 
doses due to body weight and treatment durations were explainable. Further, the hCG dose was allowed 
to vary in each subject and dose was titrated based on individual response of the subject so that both 
testosterone and oestrogen levels were maintained in an acceptable range. This explains that the hCG 
dose could range from 500 to 5000 IU based on subject response and therefore the overall dose varied 
substantially.  
Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis for testicular volume and the analyses for all secondary efficacy endpoints was 
based on the FAS population. 
Two other populations were used for supportive analyses of testicular volume, the completers and MITT 
populations. The MITT population included all participants who had received at least 36 weeks of 
treatment (12 weeks of priming with CFA and 24 weeks of combined treatment with CFA and hCG) and 
had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measurement of testicular volume at ≥36 weeks of treatment. 
The completers population included participants who remained on the study medication regimen and 
completed through Week 64.  
Of the total 17 allocated participants, a total of 13 participants were included in the FAS population. A 
total of 16 participants were included in the MITT population, and 16 participants were included 
completers population (Table 17).

Efficacy results 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Testicular Volume Change 
Testicular volume was measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. 
Priming period 
In the priming period, the mean testicular volume changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 2.5 mL 
(mean fold increase of 1.83 (95% CI of 1.58, 2.13; Table 18)). 
Table 18 Analysis of testicular volume (mL) change from baseline to week 12 
Overall treatment period 
During the overall treatment period, the increase noted in testicular volume at Week 64 changed from a 
geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 12.9 mL, mean fold increase of 9.43 mL (95% CI of 7.44, 11.97; Table 19). 
There was a continuous increase in mean testicular volume (measured by ultrasound), with the largest 
increase noted at Week 64. 
The mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 was less than the testicular volume observed 
at the end of normally-timed puberty. This reflected the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while 
normal puberty lasts for 2 to 3 years. At Week 64, three participants had a change of testicular volume of 
≥20 mL from baseline.

Figure 14 Analysis of Testicular Volume Change Over Time 
Note: The geometric mean of testicular volume at baseline was 1.4 mL. 
The primary endpoint for efficacy was shown by an increase in testicular volume, measured as the sum of 
volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. In the priming period on CFA alone, with the aim to 
stimulate FSH receptors on Sertoli cells, the mean testicular volume changed from a geometric mean of 
1.4 mL to 2.5 mL, mean fold increase of 1.83 (95% CI of 1.58, 2.13).  
During the overall treatment period, the increase noted in testicular volume at Week 64 changed from a 
geometric mean of 1.4 mL at baseline to 12.9 mL, mean fold increase of 9.43 (95% CI of 7.44, 11.97). It 
was noted that the mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 (geometric mean 12.9 mL) 
was less than the testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed puberty, but that this is as 
expected considering the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while normal puberty lasts for 2 to 3 
years. This explanation can be accepted as the testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed 
puberty is ≥24 mL (Rohany et al; 2017).  
While it may be possible to treat HH adolescents with gonadotropins for a longer duration, the exposure 
to gonadotropins at the start of puberty is likely to increase the chances of successful induction of 
spermatogenesis when fertility is desired in the future. Testicular growth and the hormonal profile 
induced during therapy in study P043 suggest that future fertility is therefore likely to be preserved in 
these males unlike the situation in HH adolescents treated exclusively with hCG or T to induce 
masculinization in adolescence. The rationale behind the treatment paradigm and the duration of 
treatment has further been sufficiently explained by literature data.

The increase in mean testicular volume during the overall treatment period was symmetric in both testes, 
which is shown in the table below (Table 20).

Laterality 
Body weight and dose 
Participants who began the study weighing ≤60 kg (and received 100 μg CFA), and participants who 
began the study weighing >60 kg (and received 150 μg CFA), had similar increases in mean testicular 
volume (Table 21). 
Table 21 Summary of Testicular Volume (mL) Change by Weight 
Secondary efficacy endpoint - Tanner Stage of Development 
Genital Growth 
At the start of the study, 12 participants (92.3%) in the FAS were prepubertal (Tanner I) and 1 
participant was in early puberty (Tanner II) for genital growth. At Week 36, most participants had 
progressed and were in mid puberty (Tanner III). At Week 64, 1 participant was in early puberty (Tanner 
II), 5 participants were in mid puberty (Tanner III), and 6 participants were in late puberty (Tanner IV/V) 
(Figure 15). One participant had a genital assessment (Tanner staging) collected outside the Week 64 
analysis window and was not included in the FAS analysis. 
Pubic hair 
At Week 64, all participants had pubic hair development ranging from Tanner III to V indicating pubertal 
progress. 
Figure 15 Summary of Tanner stage over time Genital Growth 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 43/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By week 64 all but one study participant was at Tanner Stage ≥3 and 6 study participants were at Tanner 
stage IV or V for genital growth 
Pubic hair development was similar in the 12 subjects who were Tanner Stage 1 or 2 at baseline. Seven 
subjects were Tanner Stage IV or V at week 64. Less than half of participants had achieved the final 
stages of pubertal change further suggesting that treatment duration was too short.  
Development of secondary sexual characteristics is often a key outcome for the adolescent patients 
themselves in order to deal with the psychological distress that can be associated with sexual infantilism. 
Treatment duration should be adequate to support virilisation. 
Secondary endpoint - Growth velocity 
Participants demonstrated an increased linear growth in response to hCG, indicative of pubertal changes. 
Growth velocity at Week 36 (8.2 cm/year) and Week 64 (7.4 cm/year) was as expected in HH boys, who 
were responding to therapy. 
The participants started at a mean pre-treatment height of 160.1 cm ±10.5 cm. At the end of the study, 
mean height was 169.3 cm ±8.4 cm. Data are summarised in Table 22 below.  
It was noted that boys undergoing normally-timed puberty have been reported to have a mean 
prepubertal height of 156 cm at age 13, with increases from 5 cm/year to 7 cm/year during the first year 
of puberty. For participants in this study, mean baseline height was greater than 156 cm, reflecting the 
fact that they were older than 13 at the beginning of the study. Changes in height and growth velocities

observed in study participants are generally consistent with the changes observed in boys with normally-
timed puberty. 
Table 22 Summary of growth velocity (cm/year) at week 64 
The study participants demonstrated increased growth velocity, with 8.2 cm/year at week 36 and 7.4 
cm/year at week 64, which is generally consistent with the changes observed in boys with normally-timed 
puberty. 
Secondary endpoint - Serum inhibin B concentrations 
The inhibin B surge occurs immediately after initiation of CFA suggesting a direct stimulatory effect on the 
Sertoli cells. Inhibin levels increased from a mean 32 ± 35.3 ng/mL to 134.38 ± 141 ng/mL at week 12. 
Inhibin levels remain fairly constant over the remainder of the study. The observed increase in inhibin B 
levels is consistent with proliferation of Sertoli cells in response to CFA. The number of Sertoli cells is 
associated with sperm-producing capacity. The inhibin B response suggests that the testicles had matured 
and that the transition from AMH to inhibin B production in the testicles associated with puberty had 
occurred. 
Figure 16 Summary of Inhibin B over time 
Source: [P043MK8962: adam-adsl; adeh] 
Inhibin levels increased from a mean 32 ± 35.3 ng/mL to 134.38 ± 141 ng/mL at week 12. Inhibin levels 
remain fairly constant over the remainder of the study. These inhibin values fall short of the inhibin 
values reported for healthy young men Winters et al 2013 (183-248pg/ml depending on BMI).

Secondary endpoint - Endocrine parameters (LH, Total T, T, E2, SHBG, and AMH) 
LH and FSH 
There was no evidence of spontaneous puberty (LH ≤3 IU) in any participant during the study (Table 23). 
Results of FSH levels were consistent with the pattern observed for LH.  
Table 23 Summary of LH (IU/L) change from baseline by time point 
Testosterone (T) 
Total T levels increased in response to hCG administered starting from Week 12. Mean total T levels at 
Week 64 (5.42 μg/L) were within the normal range (1 – 12 μg/L) observed in adolescent boys undergoing 
normally timed puberty (See Table 24; Figure 17 below).

Figure 17 Summary of total testosterone over time 
Antimullerian Hormone (AMH) 
There was an initial increase in AMH during the priming period, which is consistent with stimulation by 
CFA alone. After Week 12, when CFA was combined with hCG, mean AMH levels decreased, with the 
lowest AMH value at Week 64 (Figure 18). These results suggest that pubertal progression in response to 
treatment resulted in further Sertoli cell and testicular maturation. The production of T in response to 
hCG led to a transition from AMH to inhibin B production in Sertoli cells, a finding associated with puberty.

Estradiol (E2) 
The increased estradiol observed in response to treatment was consistent with the changes in total T 
levels and reflect peripheral aromatization of T (Table 25). No participant reported an AE of 
gynecomastia. 
Table 25 Summary of estradiol (ng/L) change from baseline by time point 
Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) 
The production of SHBG in the liver is regulated by the ratio of T and E2 levels (among others). During 
male puberty, a change in the T/E2 ratio in favour of T leads to a decrease in SHBG levels as observed in 
the participants in this study in response to administration of hCG (Table 26). 
Table 261 Summary of SHBG (ug/dL) change from baseline by time point 
Secondary endpoint - Testicular sonographic pattern 
Participants with HH have a hypoechogenic pattern of the testicular parenchyma, which becomes more 
normo-echogenic with testicular maturation after gonadotropin treatment.  
Changes in echogenicity in testicular sonographic patterns reported in participants were consistent with 
the testicular maturation observed (Table 27).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
In  the  Extension  of  indication  procedure,  an  additional  indication  was  claimed  for  Elonva  (Corifollitropin 
alfa;  CFA)  for  treatment  of  adolescent  males  (14  to  less  than  18  years)  with  hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism  (HH),  in  combination  with  human  Chorionic  Gonadotropin  (hCG).  CFA  is  a  recombinant 
gonadotropin, which has the same mechanism of action as FSH, but different PK properties, i.e. a longer 
T1/2 which reduces the injection frequency. The dose recommendation is based on body weight, i.e. 100 
micrograms for body weight ≤ 60 kg; 150 micrograms for body weight > 60 kg. The dose regimen is Elonva 
once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by concomitant administration of Elonva (once every 2 weeks) 
with hCG. No treatment duration has been recommended. 
The rationale for the pre-treatment with CFA in HH  adolescents is to mimic the sequential gonadotropin 
release pattern of normal puberty, i.e. at the initial stage of puberty, FSH secretion induces proliferation of 
Sertoli cells in the prepubertal testis, leading to an increase in gonadal size. Due to subsequent LH secretion, 
Leydig cells in the testes start production of T, resulting in cessation of Sertoli cell proliferation, followed 
by maturation of the Sertoli cells, resulting in the completion of spermatogenesis. This sequential exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 53/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  the  pubertal  testes  to  FSH  and  LH  is  thought  to  be  necessary  for  normal  testicular  development  and 
subsequent future fertility.  
The clinical pharmacology program consisted of two Pop PK studies, on which results the dose to be used 
in the clinical trial in male adolescents with HH is based.  
Pivotal data for efficacy and safety of the selected CFA regimen in this new indication were collected via 
study P043. 
The study protocol of study 043 has been assessed and agreed upon in the paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP) for CFA (PIP decision: P/0143/2019). Further, the protocol and study results of P043 were assessed 
and agreed within the Article 46 procedure EMEA/H/C/ 001106/P46/019, submitted earlier this year. 
Design and conduct of clinical study P043 
P043 was a multi-centre, open-label, single-group study evaluating the treatment of CFA in combination 
with  hCG  to  induce  and/or  restore  puberty  and  induce  and/or  restore  spermatogenesis  with  a  total 
maximum  duration  of  73  weeks  in  adolescent  males  with  HH.  This  single-arm  study  is  considered 
acceptable, since HH is a rare disease and recruitment of a sufficient number of subjects for both treatment 
and comparator arm would be unfeasible. The study was performed from February 2017 until June 2020. 
Proposed dose strength, which is in relation to weight, is the same as the current posology for women, and 
combined regimen with hCG were considered adequate, as discussed in the clinical pharmacology section. 
The proposed sample size and methodology are in line with the assessment of the protocol as agreed in 
the PIP (PIP-decision P/0143/2019), and therefore acceptable. 
To mimic the sequential gonadotropin release pattern of normal puberty, i.e. at the initial stage of puberty, 
a 2-stage treatment approach proposed to the treatment of HH which is started with CFA treatment (priming 
period) to stimulate proliferation of immature Sertoli cells and germ cells. This increases testicular size and 
increases  circulating  inhibin  B  levels.  Subsequently,  a  combined  treatment  of  CFA  +  hCG  is  given  to 
stimulate  Leydig  cells  in  the  testes  to  start  production  of  testosterone  for  the    development  of  male 
secondary  sexual  characteristics,  pubertal  growth  spurt  and  maturation  of  Sertoli  cells.  Although  the 
proposed sample size and methodology are in line with the assessment of the protocol as agreed in the 
PIP, it is difficult to fully evaluate long-term outcomes of adolescent patients treated with this regimen in 
this small open label study with no randomisation in a small heterogeneous population. However, HH is a 
rare condition and the challenges with recruitment are acknowledged. There is no quantitative measure of 
achievement of spermatogenesis in this study, though increased MTV, decreasing anti-Müllerian hormone 
levels and increases in Inhibin B levels were suggestive of initiation of spermatogenesis.  
Patient management once pubertal development has been achieved, will include long-term treatment with 
testosterone  to  maintain  secondary  sexual  characteristics.  This  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the 
SmPC. Transition from paediatric to adult treatment is also addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Study participants 
At least 15 treatment-naïve adolescent male participants of 14 to <18 years of age with the diagnosis of 
HH, either congenital or acquired with onset before puberty, were to be enrolled in the study. The inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were acceptable and reflect the pre-puberty HH male population with pre-gonadarche 
testes. 
Efficacy endpoints 
The primary and secondary objectives and endpoints were considered adequate for the specific male HH 
population  with  appropriate  parameters  for  evaluation  of  the  pubertal  development  and  therefore 
acceptable and was in line with the agreed PIP (PIP decision: P/0143/2019).  
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 54/75 
 
 
 
 
 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  is  described  as  the  change  from  baseline  (Day  1)  to  Week  64  in  log-
transformed testicular volume (measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound). 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints concerned the Tanner stage of pubertal development at Weeks 12, 36, 
and 64, growth velocity at Weeks 36 and 64, change from baseline in serum inhibin B concentrations at 
Week 64 and changes from baseline in endocrine parameters LH, Total T, T, E2, SHBG, and AMH at Weeks 
12, 36, and 64. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient flow 
17 patients were enrolled in the study across 9  sites in 4 countries: Mexico (n=1), Brazil (n=4),  Russia 
(n=11) and Italy (n=1). Only one patient was recruited from Europe, with the rest of the population was 
recruited  outside  the  EU.  Since  the  efficacy  and  safety  analyses  are  based  on  a  common  biological 
mechanism linking treatment to outcome, there is in general no reason to expect that the findings differ 
across geographic regions. This is supported by public literature indicating baseline characteristics of the 
participants in study P043 to be comparable to the baseline characteristics reported for adolescent males 
with HH from EU countries at the start of treatment (Barrio R et al, Fertil Steril. 1999 Feb;71(2):244-8; 
Giagulli VA et al, J Sex Med. 2011;8:3471-8; Raivio T et al, Eur J Endocrinol 2007;156:105-11). 
The number of patients who completed the study was high with 94% (16/17). One patient discontinued 
due to the occurrence of an adverse event (see ‘safety’ section). Almost half of the patients (n=8, 47%) 
did have protocol deviations, which were mostly related to study procedures and consequently few missing 
data. None of the deviations were classified as serious and they are not expected to affect the findings. 
Demographics and disease characteristics 
The 17 participants, who were included in the study, can be considered representative of pre-pubertal HH 
patients based on Tanner stages and hormone levels. Thirteen patients were included in the full analysis 
set (FAS). These were subjects who received any dose of CFA and who had a baseline of at least one post-
baseline measurement of testicular volume. 
Of note, the mean age of the patients was 15.5 years, with a majority over 16 years. The patients, included 
in  the  study,  were  older  than  adolescent  males,  who  normally  start  puberty  at  around  the  age  of  13. 
However, this is expected given the rationale for selecting the lower age limit of 14 years, as the diagnosis 
of HH in adolescent males younger than 14 years is difficult to establish, and the likelihood of HH as the 
diagnosis  is  higher  in  males  who  are  14  years  and  older.  Additionally,  delayed  puberty  is  not  generally 
treated (for the induction of secondary sexual characteristics) before the age of 14 years. However, the 
older age is not expected to have consequences for the outcome of the study. 
Treatment of subjects who initiate treatment age 17 may require treatment past age 18 years until the 
desired induction of puberty and maturation of Sertoli cells has been reached. The wording of the indication 
in  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC  should  state  adolescent  males  14  years  and  older  and  this  wording  was 
implemented in the Product Information.  
Only one study participant was from the EU. Baseline characteristics of the participants in Study P043 were 
generally  comparable  to  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the  cohorts  of  HH  adolescents  identified  in  4 
published studies that included European HH adolescents (Rohayem Clinical Endocrinology 2017; 86: 75-

Giagulli). The underlying aetiology of HH varied across studies and the P043 trial had the fewest patients 
with  diagnosed  KS  (n=1/17)  and  the  greatest  percentage  of  patients  with  HH  without  olfaction  deficit 
(n=14/17). The clinical features of male hypogonadism experienced by KS patients are at the more severe

end  of  the  spectrum  and  therefore  are  expected  to have  a  similar  response  to  treatment  as  subjects  in 
study P043. 
Extent of exposure 
All participants received 6 or 7 doses of CFA before starting hCG. During the combined treatment period, 
participants received CFA with 500 to 5000 IU of hCG. In 2 participants, the dose of CFA was increased per 
protocol from 100 to 150 µg.  
Regarding the duration of the use of CFA and hCG, it was noticed that the length of the treatment periods 
differed  among  the  included  patients,  although  the  study  was  set  up  for  a  total  treatment  period  of  64 
weeks. The mean duration of combined CFA and hCG was 442 days (range 294 to 462 days) and 352 days 
(range  210  to  371  days),  respectively.  Further,  the  dose  of  hCG  applied  varied  between  patients.  All 
subjects received at least 12 weeks of CFA prior to starting hCG. Further, most patients were exposed for 
a median total treatment duration of 64 weeks. One patient suffered from an AE and discontinued treatment 
at 42 weeks and two patients had shorter treatment duration due to a switch in dose strength from 100 to 
150 μg. It is therefore considered that the treatment duration of CFA followed by CFA + hCG was generally 
64  weeks.  Further,  the  hCG  dose  was  allowed  to  vary  in  each  subject  and  dose  was  titrated  based  on 
individual response of the subject so that both testosterone and oestrogen levels were maintained in an 
acceptable  range.  This  explains  that  the  hCG  dose  could  range  from  500  to  5000  IU  based  on  subject 
response and therefore the overall hCG dose varied substantially. 
Efficacy 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint for efficacy was shown by an increase in testicular volume, measured as the sum of 
volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. In the priming period on CFA alone, with the aim to stimulate 
FSH receptors on Sertoli cells, the mean testicular volume changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 
2.5 mL, mean fold increase of 1.83 (95% CI of 1.58, 2.13).  
During the overall treatment period, the increase noted in testicular volume at Week 64 changed from a 
geometric mean of 1.4 mL at baseline to 12.9 mL, mean fold increase of 9.43 (95% CI of 7.44, 11.97) mL. 
It was noted that the mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 (geometric mean 12.9 mL) 
was  less  than  the  testicular  volume  observed  at  the  end  of  normally-timed  puberty,  but  that  this  is  as 
expected considering the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while normal puberty lasts for 2 to 3 
years. This explanation can be accepted as the testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed 
puberty is ≥24 mL (Rohany et al; 2017). 
While it may be possible to treat HH adolescents with gonadotropins for a longer duration, the exposure to 
gonadotropins  at  the  start  of  puberty  is  likely  to  increase  the  chances  of  successful  induction  of 
spermatogenesis when fertility is desired in the future. Testicular growth and the hormonal profile induced 
during therapy in study P043 suggest that future fertility is therefore likely to be preserved in these males 
unlike  the  situation  in  HH  adolescents  treated  exclusively  with  hCG  or  T  to  induce  masculinization  in 
adolescence.  
A background discussion with reference to clinical guidelines and recent scientific literature was provided, 
to support their claim that mimicking the sequential gonadotropin release pattern of normal puberty with 
the proposed sequential treatment at pubertal age will likely improve the chances of future fertility. 
Secondary endpoints 
One of the key secondary endpoints concerned the Tanner Stage of pubertal development of the patients. 
92% of subjects went to higher Tanner stages (III, IV and V) during the course of the study. Furthermore, 
all participants had developed pubic hair.  
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 56/75 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, growth velocity from baseline to Week 64 was 8.2 cm/year at week 36 and 7.4 cm/year at 
week 64, which are generally consistent with the changes observed in boys with normally-timed puberty.  
Also, the serum inhibin B levels, a surrogate marker of spermatogenesis, increased on the use of CFA alone 
to  week  12.  Levels  were  maintained  up  to  week  64.  Levels  rose  from  a  mean  at  Baseline  of  51.3 
pg/mL(±46.92) to a mean of 98.6 pg/mL (±44.28) at week 52 visit. This suggests that the testicles had 
matured and that the transition from AMH to inhibin-B production seen in the testicles with puberty has 
occurred. 
Regarding the endocrine parameters, total testosterone levels increased from Week 12 in response to hCG 
to a mean total T level at Week 64 was 5.42 μg/L. Variations in testosterone levels were within the normal 
range  (1-12  μg/L)  observed  in  adolescent  boys.  The  decreased  AMH  levels  increased  on  CFA  alone  and 
decreased after hCG was added, suggesting a transition from AMH to inhibin B production in the testicles, 
in  line  with  normal  puberty.  Changes  in  E2  (increase)  and  SHBG  levels  (decrease)  were  consistent  with 
increased testosterone production. LH and FSH levels remained unchanged, suggesting that spontaneous 
puberty did not occur. 
The results from the secondary objectives can therefore be considered supportive of the primary endpoint. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
P043 was a multi-centre, open-label, single-group study evaluating the treatment of CFA in combination 
with  hCG  to  induce  and/or  restore  puberty  and  induce  and/or  restore  spermatogenesis  with  a  total 
maximum duration of 73 weeks in adolescent males with HH. 
The applied regimen of 12 weeks of pre-treatment with Elonva and subsequently 52 weeks of Elonva/hCG 
combined  showed  to  induce  testicular  development  (measured  by  increase  in  testicular  volume)  and 
development of secondary sexual characteristics in all 13 patients included in the efficacy FAS population. 
The results from the secondary objectives were supportive of an induction of  pubertal development and 
induction of spermatogenesis.  
The wording of the indication has been amended as previously requested to allow subjects who have started 
treatment  at  the  age  of  17  to  be  treated  past  the  age  of  18  years.  Moreover,  the  amended  dose 
recommendations, including the treatment duration, for Elonva in adolescent males have been amended in 
the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety  
Introduction 
One of the primary safety objectives was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-8962 over 64 weeks 
of treatment, including evaluation of development of antibodies to MK-8962, and adverse events, laboratory 
assessments, and vital sign measurements. 
Safety analyses were performed in the ASaT population of the P043 study which included all 17 participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication. AEs were collected from the time of informed consent 
until the follow-up visit (21 to 45 days after the last day of administration of CFA). 
Patient exposure 
See section ‘extent of exposure’. The mean duration of CFA and hCG was 442 days (range 294 to 462 days) 
and 352 days (range 210 to 371 days), respectively.

Sixteen of the 17 participants experienced at least one AE. The most commonly reported AEs were from 
the SOCs Investigations (52.9%), Infections and infestations (41.2%) and Reproductive system and breast 
disorders (41.2%). Overall, the most common AEs (>20%) were spermatocele (n=5), increased E2 (n=5), 
increased blood T (n=4),  and headache (n=4). One participant had an AE of  increased E2 related to an 
accidental hCG overdose. This overdose case is further discussed below. In the priming period, the most 
frequently  reported  AEs  (>10%)  were  headache  (n=3)  and  rhinorrhoea  (n=2).  This  seems  to  be  in  line 
with what is been expected for CFA.

Drug-related adverse events 
In the overall treatment period, drug-related AEs (as determined by the investigator) were reported for 9 
participants  (Table  36).  Seven  participants  had  AEs  related  to  hCG  that  included  increased  blood  T  and 
increased  E2;  2  participants  had  AEs  related  to  CFA  that  included  vomiting,  injection  site  pain,  and hot 
flush; and 1 participant had an AE related to both CFA and hCG (acne).

Seven participants had AEs related to hCG that included increased blood T and increased E2; 2 participants 
had AEs related to CFA that included vomiting, injection site pain, and hot flush; and 1 participant had an 
AE related to both CFA and hCG (acne).  
The  most  commonly  reported  drug-related  AEs  were  generally  from  similar  SOCs  as  observed  in  all 
commonly reported AEs, except for spermatocele, see discussion above. This seems to be in line with what 
is been expected for CFA and hCG. The AEs are in general sufficiently addressed in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
and presented in a separate ADR table.  
Intensity 
•  All  AEs  were  mild to  moderate  in  intensity.  AEs  reported  with  moderate intensity  included  acne, 
fracture,  hyperphagia,  migraine, 
rhinitis,  back  pain,  craniopharyngioma, 
allergic 
foot 
nasopharyngitis, scrotal disorder, tinea infection, and vomiting.  
•  Both acne and vomiting were considered possibly related to study medication.  
• 
There were no AEs with severe intensity reported.

There were no deaths reported in this study. 
Serious adverse events 
There  was  one  SAE  in  the  study.  One  participant  had  an  SAE  of  recurrent  craniopharyngioma.  This 
participant had a medical history of craniopharyngioma. This SAE led to discontinuation of study medication 
and  was  considered  by  the  investigator  not  related  to  study  medication.  The  SAE  of  recurrence  of 
craniopharyngioma was treated and the participant completed the study off study medication. 
The narrative of this patients is as follows: 
MK-8962 150 μg once every 2 weeks was started on Day 1 for the treatment of HH and was continued for 
12 weeks, followed by combined treatment with MK-8962 150 μg once every 2 weeks and hCG starting at 
1500 IU twice a week on Day 86. 
The participant had a medical history of craniopharyngioma approximately 12 years before study entry. On 
Day 113 the nonserious AE of increased blood testosterone was reported. The dose of hCG was reduced 
from  1500  IU  to  1000  IU  on  Day  128.  On  Day  113  the  laboratory  result  for  testosterone  was  59.4997 
nmol/L  (NR:  3.47-  41.64  nmol/L);  on  Day  1  the  laboratory  result  for  testosterone  was  0.0999  nmol/L. 
Increased blood testosterone resolved on Day 170 (14.7998 nmol/L). 
On Day 282 the participant experienced headache, and on Day 292, a brain MRI showed craniopharyngioma 
(SAE, recurrence of craniopharyngioma, moderate intensity, onset Day 282). On Day 296 the participant 
experienced  moderate  vision  impairment  compared  with  the  basal  level.  A  neurological  examination 
confirmed the diagnosis of recurrence of craniopharyngioma. Study medication was discontinued on Day 
298 in response to recurrence of craniopharyngioma, with the last dose of MK-8962 administered on Day 
282 and the last dose of hCG administered on Day 292, and the participant entered posttreatment follow-
up. The participant had received 21 doses of MK-8962. An ophthalmologist examination on Day 299 showed 
worsening of optic nerve atrophy in the right eye. The participant underwent transsphenoidal endoscopic 
resection of the craniopharyngioma on Day 348. Recurrence of craniopharyngioma resolved on Day 351. 
Headache had resolved and vision had recovered to the basal level. Results from an MRI performed on Day 
403 showed residual tissue of craniopharyngioma. 
The participant completed the study on Day 450, with the last contact on the same day. 
In the opinion of the investigator, recurrence of craniopharyngioma was considered not related to MK-8962 
or hCG and increased blood testosterone was considered related to hCG and not related to MK-8962.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Prespecified AEs of special interest included anti-MK-8962 antibodies (ie, anti-drug antibodies; ADA), and 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
Anti-MK-8962 Antibodies 
There were no cases of confirmed anti-MK-8962 antibodies. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
There were 3 participants with hypersensitivity AEs: gingival oedema and rhinitis allergic (n=1), Dermatitis 
contact (n=1) and Pruritus (n=1).  
All  AEs  were  mild  in  intensity,  except  for  allergic  rhinitis  (moderate),  considered  not  related  to  study 
medication by the investigator, and resolved while the participant was still on study medication. 
Overdose 
One participant overdosed with hCG. The investigator provided instructions to up titrate the participant’s 
hCG  from  1500  IU  to  2000  IU,  and  parent  mistakenly  gave  the  participant  a  dose  of  5000  IU  hCG  (the 
entire contents of the 5000 IU vial) instead of 2000 IU for 6 doses (2 weeks). The participant had an AE of 
increased estradiol during this period. 
The case narrative is as follows: 
MK-8962 150 μg once every 2 weeks was started on Day 1 for the treatment of HH and was continued for 
12 weeks, followed by combined treatment with MK-8962 150 μg once every 2 weeks and hCG starting at 
1000 IU twice a week starting on Day 86 and then hCG dose was increased to 1500 IU twice a week starting 
on Day 135.  
On Day 358 the investigator increased the dose of hCG to 2000 IU twice a week. On Day 370 hCG 5000-
IU  vials  were  dispensed  to  the  participant  at  an  unscheduled  visit.  On  Day  373  accidental  overdose 
(nonserious AE, accidental overdose with adverse effect, mild intensity) was reported when the participant 
was administered the entire 5000-IU vial of hCG per dose (5000 IU hCG twice a week) from Days 373 to 
390.  Retraining  of  the  participant  and  the  participant’s  guardians  was  performed,  accidental  overdose 
resolved on Day 390, and hCG 2000 IU twice a week was administered starting on Day 394. On Day 394 
laboratory  test  results  showed  increased  E2  (nonserious  AE,  mild  intensity),  which  occurred  due  to 
overdose, and testosterone was within the normal range.

The participant completed treatment, with the last dose of MK-8962 and hCG administered on Day 450. 
Increased E2 resolved on Day 474 (Table). The participant completed the study on Day 474, with the last 
contact on the same day. 
In the opinion of the investigator, accidental overdose was considered not related to MK-8962 or hCG and 
increased E2 was considered related to hCG and not related to MK-8962. 
Hepatic Safety 
No participants met the biochemical criteria for drug-induced livery injury. 
Cerebrovascular disorder 
One  participant  with  underlying  hypopituitarism  underwent  a  routine  endocrine  evaluation  and  was 
discovered to have elevated prolactin levels and 'cerebral discirculation' on Day 295. Upon further inquiry, 
this AE term meant 'a minimal disorder of cerebral blood flow that often has no clinical signs and is not a 
sign of a stroke or a cerebrovascular accident'. An MRI on Day 349 reported no changes or other symptoms 
from previous examinations. The AE of ‘cerebral discirculation’ was ongoing and stable at the final visit. 
The  investigator  assessed  the  AE  as  not  related  to  study  medication.  The  verbatim  term  of  ‘cerebral 
discirculation’ was mapped to the PT of cerebrovascular disorder. 
Laboratory findings 
The changes over time for blood chemistry (ALP and creatinine), haematology and prespecified endocrine 
laboratory values (T, E2, and SHBG) were expected to change while participants underwent puberty.  
Safety  ranges  for  each  parameter  were  used  to  identify  markedly  abnormal  chemistry  or  haematology 
values during the study: 
•  5 participants had 1 value >1.5 x ULN for ALP 
• 
The last serum creatinine values for 3 participants met the PDLC criterion of increase in creatinine of 
≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline; however, all 3 values were below the ULN (1.2 mg/dL). 
•  No participants met the PDLC criteria for ALT, AST, bilirubin, or drug-induced liver injury. 
•  One participant met the PDLC criterion of last haemoglobin value (12.2 g/dL) (baseline 13.7 g/dL; NR: 
12.7 g/dL–18.1 g/dL) at Week 36. Haematocrit had decreased by 5% from baseline (to 38%) and was 
slightly below the LLN (39.5%). The MCV was unchanged and was within the NR at all measurements. 
A subsequent CBC sample obtained at Week 64 was clotted and no repeat samples were obtained. 
• 
Elevated  prolactin  levels  (NR:  130-600  mIU/L)  were  noted  for  1  participant  during  a  routine  clinical 
evaluation scheduled in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients 
with hypopituitarism. On Day 295, an AE of ‘blood prolactin increased’  was first noted (2445 mIU/L). 
A  pituitary  MRI  revealed  no  changes  from  previous  scans.  This  participant  had  an  associated  AE  of 
cerebrovascular disorder. Repeat prolactin levels were stable (Day 301; 2301 mIU/L, Day 307; 2506 
mIU/L,  Day  352;  2092  mIU/L).  The  AE  of  elevated  prolactin  was  considered  not  related  to  study 
medication. 
Vital signs 
Vital  signs  (including  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  and  body  weight),  and  clinical  laboratory  parameters 
(serum haematology and chemistry) were measured at visits during the overall treatment period and at 
the follow-up visit. No notable changes from baseline in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate 
were observed through Week 64. The only notable change was in height, which is expected in adolescent

males undergoing puberty. Expected increases in weight with no notable changes in BMI were observed 
through Week 64. Data are summarised in the Table 37 below.

Safety in special populations 
The current submission provides information in support of the existing CFA safety profile with respect to 
adolescent boys (14 to 17 years old). It does not provide new safety information on use in pregnancy or 
when lactating, overdose, drug interactions, drug abuse, withdrawal or rebound, effects on ability to drive 
machinery, or on impairment of mental ability. 
Based on the cumulative data in the clinical development program, no safety signal has been identified. In 
the  1  participant  who  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  a  SAE  of  recurrent  craniopharyngioma, 
testicular volume decreased after discontinuation.  
The  number  of  participants  in  study  P043  is  low.  Despite  the  small  group  size,  baseline  and  end-of-
treatment characteristics are generally similar to males with HH presenting to endocrinology clinics. These 
findings suggest that the results from study P043 will be applicable to the general population of adolescents 
with HH N/A. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One participant discontinued study medication due to an SAE of craniopharyngioma, but continued in the 
study. The investigator considered this SAE not related to study medication.  
Post marketing experience 
Safety of CFA in Female Population  
Elonva (CFA) is approved in the female population for COS. 
In post-marketing reports, hypersensitivity reactions, both local and generalized including bruising, pain, 
redness, swelling, itching, and rash, were reported, the majority of which were mild and transient in nature. 
Very rarely, generalized reactions including erythema and rash have been observed. 
Thromboembolic events, both in association with and separate from OHSS, have been reported following 
fertility treatment with gonadotropins, including Elonva. Intravascular thrombosis, which may originate in 
venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the extremities. 
Safety of CFA in Adult Male Population  
In  adult  males  with  HH  (P031),  AEs  that  were  reported  included  headache,  acne,  rash,  increased  blood 
testosterone, increased blood estradiol, epididymal cyst, gynecomastia, and injection site reaction. 
Safety of CFA PK studies 
Safety information collected in the PK studies, that have been discussed earlier in the AR, is in line with the 
findings in the P043 trial.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety  
One  of  the  primary  objectives  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  MK-8962  over  64  weeks  of 
treatment, including evaluation of development of antibodies to MK-8962, and adverse events, laboratory 
assessments, and vital sign measurements. 
Safety analyses were performed in the ASaT population of the P043 study which included all 17 participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication. AEs were collected from the time of informed consent 
until the follow-up visit (21 to 45 days after the last day of administration of CFA). Safety information from 
the adult study (P031) and the PK studies are in line with safety data from the main trial. No safety concerns 
have been identified.  
Adverse events 
Sixteen of the 17 participants experienced at least one AE. The most commonly reported AEs were from 
the SOCs Investigations (52.9%), Infections and infestations (41.2%) and Reproductive system and breast 
disorders (41.2%). Overall, the most common AEs (>20%) were spermatocele (n=5), increased E2 (n=5), 
increased blood T (n=4),  and headache (n=4). One participant had an AE of  increased E2 related to an 
accidental hCG overdose. In the priming period, the most frequently reported AEs (>10%) were headache 
(n=3) and rhinorrhoea (n=2).  
The cases of spermatocele, were not considered as drug-related, although the number of reported cases 
was  relatively  high  with  5  out  of  17  patients  (29%).  However,  the  incidence  rate  of  spermatocele  is 
consistent with the background incidence in published studies in patients with HH. Based on the cumulative 
review of the 5 cases, in one case the event was resolved during treatment and therefore a clear association 
of the use of CFA and the occurrence of the event of spermatocele within this case is considered unlikely. 
The  other  4  cases  had  not  resolved  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study.  It  can  be  agreed  that  the  initiated 
increase in testicular volume during this study can be considered an important confounding factor, which 
may have made these testicular cysts more apparent on imaging as the study progressed. Considering also 
the high  prevalence  of  spermatocele  in  the  general  population,  the  suggested  contribution of  congenital 
anomalies in this area, and the lack of a mechanism of action, it is acceptable to not consider spermatocele 
an ADR. 
Drug-related adverse events 
Nine participants had drug-related AEs. Seven participants had AEs related to hCG that included increased 
blood T and increased E2; 2 participants had AEs related to CFA that included vomiting, injection site pain, 
and  hot  flush;  and  1  participant  had  an  AE  related  to  both  CFA  and  hCG  (acne).  The  most  commonly 
reported  drug-related  AEs  were  generally  from  similar  SOCs  as  observed  in  all  commonly  reported  AEs, 
except for spermatocele. This seems to be in line with what is been expected for CFA and hCG. The AEs are 
sufficiently addressed in section 4.8 of the SmPC and presented in a separate table.  
Serious adverse events 
All AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.  
There  were  no  deaths  reported  in  this  study.  Only  one  SAE  has  been  reported.  This  SAE  concerned  a 
recurrent craniopharyngioma. The patient discontinued study medication, but remained in the study. Based 
on the information of the narrative, it can be agreed that CFA of hCG has not contributed to the SAE, as 
the  participant  had  a  medical  history  of  craniopharyngioma  approximately  12  years  before  study  entry. 
Craniopharyngiomas are generally benign but are known to recur after resection. Although it is unknown 
whether this concerns a malignant form, it is known that malignant craniopharyngiomas are very rare, but 
are  associated  with  poor  prognosis.  The  reported  SAE  seems  therefore  not  to  be  related  to  the  trial 
medication.

Adverse events of special interest 
AEs  of  special  interest  for  CFA  were  anti-MK-8962  antibodies  (i.e.,  anti-drug  antibodies;  ADA),  and 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
Anti-MK-8962 antibodies 
No cases of confirmed anti-MK-8962 antibodies were reported. 
Hypersensitivity 
There were 3 participants with hypersensitivity AEs: gingival oedema and rhinitis allergic (n=1), dermatitis 
contact (n=1) and pruritus (n=1). These AEs were considered not related to study medication and resolved 
while the participant was still on study medication.  
One  accidental  overdose  case  of  hCG  has  been  reported  and  not  with  CFA.  Consequently,  E2  became 
increased and was thus considered related to hCG, but the AE was resolved at the end of the study.  
Also one AE of ‘cerebral discirculation’ was observed. The AE was ongoing and stable at the final visit. The 
investigator assessed the AE as not related to study medication, which can be agreed. 
Of note, no clinical studies have been performed in elderly, patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment 
and younger children (< 14 years of age), but this has been sufficiently described in the SmPC.  
Clinical laboratory data 
Clinical laboratory data did not show unexpected values or changes due to study medication. 
Vital signs 
No notable changes from baseline in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate were observed through 
Week 64. Expected increases in weight and height with no notable changes in BMI were observed through 
Week 64. 
Long-term safety 
Long  term  safety  data  in  adolescent  males  who  had  received  this  sequential  treatment  of  CFA  priming 
followed by combined CFA + hCG treatment at pubertal age for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism will be 
monitored via routine pharmacovigilance (see RMP assessment). However, according to current guidelines, 
after  completion  of  this  treatment,  these  patients  will  receive  long-term  treatment  with  testosterone  to 
maintain secondary sexual characteristics. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety  
Based  on  the  study  data  of  Study  P043,  CFA  in  combination  with  hCG  indicated  for  male  adolescents 
suffering from HH was generally well tolerated. There were no severe AEs and no SAEs, except one SAE of 
recurrence of pre-existing craniopharyngioma leading to discontinuation, but was considered not-related to 
the  study  medication.  Further,  no  cases  of  confirmed  anti-MK-8962  antibodies  were  reported.  Clinical 
laboratory data did not show unexpected values or changes due to study medication and no notable changes 
from baseline through week 64 were observed in the vitals sign assessments. 
The main drug-related adverse events were increased E2 and increased blood T. The distribution appears 
to be in line with what has been expected for this type of medication and the use of hCG. The current safety 
profile of CFA does not suggest any safety concerns.

2.7.  Update of the Product information  
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to implement some minor 
editorial and formatting changes throughout the Product Information.  
Please refer to the attached Product Information, which includes all changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation  
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.  
It is agreed with the MAH that the few changes to the package leaflet proposed in this variation are limited 
to the information in section 1 (“What Elonva is and what it is used for), section 3 (“How to use Elonva”) 
and section 4 (“Possible side effects”) to add information on the use of Elonva in adolescent males.  
There are no other proposed changes to the content of the package leaflet; in particular the key messages 
for the safe use of the medicinal product are not impacted. There are no proposed changes to the content

of the Instructions for Use. Just replacement of one picture to a more gender friendly picture is proposed. 
Furthermore, the design, layout and format of the package leaflet and the Instructions for Use are not be 
affected by the proposed revisions. 
It is therefore agreed with the MAH that the proposed revisions in the Package leaflet do not constitute 
significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Elonva  (Corifollitropin  alfa;  CFA)  is  a  recombinant  gonadotropin  and  is  designed  as  a  sustained  follicle 
stimulant with the same pharmacodynamic profile as (rec) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), but with a 
markedly  prolonged  duration  of  FSH  activity.  The  medicinal  product  is  currently  indicated  for  Controlled 
Ovarian Stimulation (COS) in combination with a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist for 
the development of multiple follicles in women participating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) 
program. 
The following additional indication was approved: Elonva is indicated for the treatment of adolescent males 
(14  years  and  older)  with  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism,  in  combination  with  human  Chorionic 
Gonadotropin (hCG). 
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is lack of, or inadequate, production of gonadotropins, i.e. FSH and 
luteinising hormone (LH), from the pituitary gland and can be caused by a primary defect in gonadotropin 
secretion by the pituitary gonadotrophs, or from absent or inadequate GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus. 
This results in insufficient testicular function and deficiencies in endogenous testosterone production and 
spermatogenesis. When gonadotropin deficiency occurs before puberty (prepubertal), puberty is delayed 
or absent. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
The  primary  goal  in  the  treatment  of  male  HH  is  to  increase  testosterone  (T)  levels  (either  through  the 
administration of exogenous T, or by using hCG to stimulate LH receptors on Leydig cells of the testes and 
induce the production of endogenous T from Leydig cells). This leads to a pubertal growth spurt and the 
development  of  male  secondary  sexual  characteristics.  Another  important  goal  is  to  stimulate 
spermatogenesis to  support  fertility.  This  requires treatment  with  FSH  to  stimulate  the  proliferation  and 
maturation of Sertoli cells in the testes, to be initiated before hCG treatment.  
It is noted that to compensate for the lack of LH, hCG is given instead of LH. LH and hCG share the same 
alfa subunit and bind to the Leydig cell receptors, but hCG has a half-life of 36 hours, while the half live of 
LH is only 30 minutes. 
Historically, boys with HH were given exogenous testosterone to induce the development of male secondary 
sexual characteristics. However, boys that are not exposed to FSH may miss a critical state of testicular 
development with regard to spermatogenesis.  
Currently, modern treatment protocols for adolescent males with HH use a 3-staged approach:  
- 
a short period of treatment with FSH-only to promote Sertoli cell proliferation and maturation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 69/75 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
followed  by  treatment  with  a  combination  of  FSH  and  hCG  to  stimulate  Leydig  cell  function  and 
increase T production until testicular volumes attain adult size,  
after which gonadotropin therapy can be stopped and T supplementation can be used to maintain 
male secondary sexual characteristics until fertility is desired.  
This approach allows for both the induction of puberty and maturation of Sertoli cells in early onset HH so 
that spermatogenesis and future fertility are not compromised. 
The rationale for the pre-treatment with FSH in HH  adolescents is to mimic the sequential gonadotropin 
release pattern of normal puberty, i.e. at the initial stage of puberty, FSH secretion induces proliferation of 
Sertoli cells in the prepubertal testis, leading to an increase in gonadal size. Due to subsequent LH secretion, 
Leydig cells in the testes start production of T, resulting in cessation of Sertoli cell proliferation, followed 
by maturation of the Sertoli cells, leading to the completion of spermatogenesis. This sequential exposure 
of  the  pubertal  testes  to  FSH  and  LH  is  thought  to  be  necessary  for  normal  testicular  development  and 
subsequent future fertility.  
Elonva (Corifollitropin alfa; CFA) is a recombinant gonadotropin, which has the same mechanism of action 
as FSH, but different PK properties, since it has a markedly prolonged duration of FSH activity due to a 
longer T1/2. A single injection of corifollitropin alfa replaces 7 days of daily recombinant FSH. The Applicant 
claimed  that  since  treatment  of  HH  in  males  usually  requires  long-term  treatment,  the  use  of  CFA  may 
result in fewer medication errors and improved compliance. The dose recommendation is, based on body 
weight, 100 or 150 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by concomitant 
administration of Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
In line with the approved PIP (PIP-decision: P/0143/2019), one clinical, multi-centre, open-label, single-
group  trial  (P043)  was  submitted  to  evaluate  the  treatment  of  CFA  in  combination  with  hCG  to  induce 
and/or restore puberty and induce and/or restore spermatogenesis with a total maximum duration of 73 
weeks in 17 adolescent males from 14 to 18 years of age with HH enrolled from 9 study sites in 4 countries 
in Mexico, Brazil, Russia and Italy. The trial consisted of a prime period of 12 weeks with CFA alone and a 
combined treatment period of 52 weeks with CFA in combination with the use of hCG. The protocol and 
study  results  of  P043  were  assessed  and  agreed  within  the  Article  46  procedure  EMEA/H/C/ 
001106/P46/019, submitted in October 2020. 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
Increase in testicular volume  
The primary endpoint for efficacy was shown by an increase in testicular volume, measured as the sum of 
volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. In the priming period on CFA alone, with the aim to stimulate 
FSH receptors on Sertoli cells, the mean testicular volume changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 
2.5  mL  (mean  fold  increase  of  1.83  (95%  CI  of  1.58,  2.13)).  During  the  overall  treatment  period,  the 
increase noted in testicular volume at Week 64 changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 12.9 mL, 
mean fold increase of 9.43 (95% CI of 7.44, 11.97).  
It was noted that the mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 (geometric mean 12.9 mL) 
was  less  than  the  testicular  volume  observed  at  the  end  of  normally-timed  puberty  but  that  this  is  as 
expected considering the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while normal puberty lasts for 2 to 3 
years. This explanation can be accepted (according to Rohany et al (2017) testicular volume observed at 
the end of normally-timed puberty is ≥24 mL).

EMA/329358/2022 
Page 70/75 
 
 
 
 
 
Supportive secondary endpoints 
One of the key secondary endpoints concerned the Tanner Stage of pubertal development of the patients. 
92% of subjects went to higher Tanner stages (III, IV and V) during the course of the study. Furthermore, 
all participants had developed pubic hair. Additionally, growth velocity from baseline to Week 64 was 8.2 
cm/year at week 36 and 7.4 cm/year at week 64, which is generally consistent with the changes observed 
in  boys  with  normally-timed  puberty.  Also,  the  serum  inhibin  B  levels,  a  surrogate  marker  of 
spermatogenesis, increased on the use of CFA alone to week 12. Levels were maintained through week 64. 
Regarding  the  endocrine  parameters,  levels  (T,  E2,  AMH,  SHBG)  reached  normal  ranges  as  observed  in 
adolescent  boys  and  were  maintained  through  week  64.  The  results  from  the  secondary  objectives  can 
therefore be considered supportive of the primary endpoint.  
Study design  
Regarding  the  duration  of  the  use  of  CFA  and  hCG,  from  the  data  provided,  it  is  clear  that  all  subjects 
received at least 12 weeks of CFA prior to starting hCG. Further, most patients were exposed for a median 
total duration of 64 weeks. Further, the hCG dose was allowed to vary in each subject as the dose was 
titrated based on individual response of the subject so that both testosterone and oestrogen levels were 
maintained in an acceptable range. Therefore, the hCG dose could range from 500 to 5000 IU based on 
subject response and therefore the overall dose varied significantly. The hCG dose applied (500-5000 IU) 
also is added to section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Baseline data 
One subject from Europe was included in this study. Since the efficacy and safety analyses are based on a 
common biological mechanism linking treatment to outcome, there is in general no reason to expect that 
baseline characteristics and findings in HH patients differ across geographic regions. Further, compared to 
other published studies conducted in adolescents in the EU, Study P043 trial had the fewest patients with 
diagnosed KS and the greatest percentage of patients with HH without olfactory impairment. The Applicant 
adequately justified with background literature that the clinical features of male hypogonadism experienced 
by KS patients can be expected to have a similar response to treatment as subjects in study P043. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
The open label uncontrolled nature of this study makes it difficult to fully evaluate the treatment effect of 
the combination of CFA and hCG. 
Although  pubertal  development  (induced  with  hCG  treatment)  was  apparent  in  all  study  participants  by 
week 64, only 6 study participants were at Tanner stage IV or V for genital growth and 7 were Tanner Stage 
IV or V at week 64 for pubic growth. Development of secondary sexual characteristics is often a key outcome 
for  the  adolescent  patients  themselves.  Treatment  duration  should  be  long  enough  to  ensure  adequate 
virilisation. This aspect is reflected in section 4.2. 
After achieving adult gonadal development to a satisfactory level, long-term treatment with testosterone is 
required in these patients to maintain these and refers to a number of literature reports that outline the 
need to also manage the side effects of testosterone treatment and address psychosocial aspects of CHH 
along  with  the  long-term  health  effects  of  treatment  in  terms  of  cardiovascular  health,  and  bone 
metabolism. The statements are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the need and the purpose 
for long-term treatment of patients with HH with testosterone  and that no follow-up efficacy or safety data 
are available once the combined treatment with CFA and hCG at pubertal age has been completed. 
A  baseline  inhibin  B  cut-off  of  35  pg/mL  was  included  in  the  inclusion  criteria.  Mean  Inhibin  B  levels  at 
baseline were 44.9 ng/L with a median of 25 ng/L but with a range of 11-144.  For the 2 subjects with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/329358/2022 
Page 71/75 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline inhibin B level >35 ng/L it can be concluded that they nevertheless were correctly diagnosed. The 
diagnosis  of  the  3rd  patient  remains  unclear  based  on  course  of  TV  growth.  However,  CHH  is  a 
heterogeneous disorder and variability in biomarker levels is not unusual. 
Regarding the primary endpoint, it was noted that the mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 
64 (geometric mean 12.9 mL) was less than the testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed 
puberty, although this is as expected considering the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while normal 
puberty lasts for 2 to 3 years.  
The SmPC indicates that duration of treatment may be necessary for 52 weeks or longer. In the absence 
of follow-up data after the treatment has ended, no conclusions can be drawn whether this treatment also 
increases  future  fertility  chances.  However,  on  theoretical  grounds  and  published  data,  an  association 
between degree of testicular volume and initiation of spermatogenesis may increase future success with 
fertility-inducing  treatments  in  adult  males  and  therefore,  the  induction  of  testicular  growth  and 
spermatogenesis in adolescent males with HH is likely to increase future fertility chances. 
The treatment of subjects who initiate treatment at age 17 may require treatment past age 18 years until 
the  desired  induction  of  puberty  and  maturation  of  Sertoli  cells  has  been  reached.  The  wording  of  the 
indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC states that the treatment is indicated in adolescent males aged 14 
years and older. Section 4.4 has been updated to indicate that after completed pubertal transition with the 
current treatment regimen, long-term treatment with testosterone is required in these patients to maintain 
secondary sexual characteristics, but that follow-up treatments have not been evaluated. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
One  of  the  primary  objectives  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  MK-8962  over  64  weeks  of 
treatment, including evaluation of development of antibodies to MK-8962, and adverse events, laboratory 
assessments, and vital sign measurements, in the ASaT population of the P043 study, which included all 
17 participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Based on the study data of Study P043, 
CFA in combination with hCG indicated for male adolescents suffering from HH was generally well tolerated.  
Sixteen of the 17 participants experienced at least one AE. The most commonly reported AEs were from 
the SOCs Investigations (52.9%), Infections and infestations (41.2%) and Reproductive system and breast 
disorders (41.2%). Overall, the most common AEs (>20%) were spermatocele (n=5), increased E2 (n=5), 
increased blood T (n=4), and headache (n=4). Nine participants had drug-related AEs. All AEs were mild 
to moderate in intensity. 
The number of cases of spermatocele were relatively high with 5 out of 17 patients (29%). Considering 
also the high prevalence of spermatocele in the general population, the suggested contribution of congenital 
anomalies in this area of disease, and the lack of a mechanism of action, spermatocele is not considered 
an ADR. 
There were no deaths reported in this study. Only one SAE has been reported, which concerned a recurrence 
of pre-existing craniopharyngioma leading to discontinuation and was considered not-related to the study 
medication.  
Further,  no  cases  of  confirmed  anti-MK-8962  antibodies  were  reported.  Clinical  laboratory  data  did  not 
show unexpected values or changes due to study medication and no notable changes from baseline through 
week 64 were observed in the vitals sign assessments. 
Long term safety data in adolescent males with HH who have received CFA at pubertal age for induction of 
gonadal  development  and  initiation  of  secondary  sexual  characteristics  will  be  monitored  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The applied regimen of 12 weeks of pre-treatment with CFA and subsequently 52 weeks of CFA combined 
with hCG is proposed for the new indication of treatment of adolescent males (14 years and older) with HH. 
The single uncontrolled study in 17 patients with HH had a generally appropriate study design and included 
a sufficient number of subjects (n=17) representative for the rare target population. The results showed a 
clinically  relevant  increase  in  testicular  volume  accompanied  by  appropriate  evidence  of  pubertal 
progression as assessed by Tanner stage, growth velocity and other pubertal developmental parameters. 
Regarding the other pubertal developmental parameters, increased testosterone levels, growth velocity and 
progression of puberty (Tanner III, IV and V) indicated appropriate responses to CFA priming followed by 
combined treatment with CFA + hCG. Decreasing anti-müllerian hormone levels and increases in Inhibin B 
levels were suggestive of initiation of spermatogenesis. These findings are highly relevant for future fertility 
in  these  males  unlike  the  situation  in  HH  adolescents  treated  exclusively  with  hCG  or  T  to  induce 
masculinization  in  adolescence  and  might  even  be  of  benefit  for  a  better  quality  of  life  in  terms  of  an 
improved body image and potentially future fertility prospects. 
Regarding safety, in general, the clinical safety profile appeared to be well tolerated by the target population 
in terms of the frequency, nature and severity of adverse events. Only one SAE has been reported, not-
related to the study medication. Further, no ADAs were detected and there were no clinically meaningful 
changes in clinical laboratory data or vitals sign assessments. Longer-term safety data beyond completion 
of this CFA + hCG treatment at pubertal age will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
In terms of benefit, the applied regimen of 12 weeks of pre-treatment with CFA and subsequently 52 weeks 
of CFA combined with hCG showed adequate induction of testicular development, measured by a significant 
and clinically relevant increase in testicular volume from prepubertal to mid pubertal size, in adolescent 
males with HH. Important findings on development of secondary sexual characteristics by increased Tanner 
Stage, growth velocity and endocrine parameters were supportive of an induction of pubertal development 
and induction of spermatogenesis. The use of CFA appeared to be well-tolerated with an acceptable safety 
profile and without unexpected safety signals over a treatment period of 64 weeks. Long term safety data 
in adolescent males with HH who have received CFA followed by CFA + hCG for gonadal development and 
induction  of  secondary  sexual  characteristics  at  pubertal  age  will  be  monitored  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance.  
While it is recognised that HH is considered a rare disease and the number of adolescent patients in the 
pivotal study is limited, the natural history of HH is well-characterised, the mechanism of action/role of the 
product  in  the  development  of  puberty  is  well-established  and  the  safety  profile  of  the  product  is  well-
characterised as it is has been marketed since 2010. Based on these considerations, the data in the dossier 
at hand is considered sufficiently comprehensive to support a positive conclusion on the balance of benefits 
and risks of CFA.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
None.

3.8.  Conclusions  
The  overall  B/R  of  Elonva  is  positive  in  the  treatment  of  adolescent  males  (14 years  and  older)  with 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, in combination with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). 
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to include treatment of adolescent males (14 years and older) with 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, in combination with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) for Elonva, 
based on final results of the paediatric study P043. Study P043 was an open-label, non-comparative, 
multi-center safety and efficacy study of corifollitropin alfa in association with hCG in male adolescents 
with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, part of the paediatric investigation plan; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 10 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to implement some minor editorial and formatting 
changes throughout the PI.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan  P/0143/2019  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the  SmPC  and,  as 
appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

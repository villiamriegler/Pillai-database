3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 κ isotype monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that 
selectively binds and neutralises vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Binding of VEGF-A to its 
receptors triggers angiogenesis and neovascularisation by promoting vascular endothelial cell 
proliferation/ migration and an increased vascular permeability resulting in leakage. The neutralisation 
of VEGF results in a reduced vascular leakage. 
Lucentis (ranibizumab) is registered via Centralised Procedure (EMEA/H/C/000715) and is indicated in 
adults for: 
−  the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
−  the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), 
−  the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), and 
−  the treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion 
(branch RVO or central RVO). 
Problem statement 
The pathophysiology of ROP is characterised by abnormal neovascularisation. The disruption of 
angiogenesis in preterm infants with ROP typically occurs in 2 postnatal phases (Hellström et al 2013). 
In Phase 1 (~22 to 30 weeks postmenstrual age), high oxygen saturation in the immature retina 
(relative hyperoxia), coupled with low concentrations of growth factors and nutrients normally present 
in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy, lead to suppression of new vessel growth. As a result, 
the metabolically active but poorly vascularised retina becomes hypoxic. In Phase 2 (~31 to 44 weeks 
postmenstrual age), the hypoxic environment in the retina stimulates release of various angiogenic 
factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that lead to proliferation of new blood 
vessels. In preterm infants with disrupted angiogenesis, the abnormal neovascularisation and the leaky 
new blood vessels formed in this environment result in intraocular fibrosis, leading to retinal distortion, 
detachment, and visual disability. 
A regulator of angiogenesis, VEGF, plays a key role in the progression of ROP and is involved in both 
phases of ROP pathophysiology. The levels of VEGF differ in the two phases of abnormal 
neovascularisation and are associated with different outcomes. Suppression of VEGF by non-
physiologically high tissue oxygenation in Phase 1 of ROP inhibits normal vessel growth, whereas 
upregulation of VEGF induced by relative hypoxia in Phase 2 of ROP leads to pathological 
neovascularisation (Chen and Smith 2007). Excessive levels of VEGF lead to abnormal vascular 
proliferation and ultimately, if left untreated, to retinal detachment, which may result in blindness. 
Treatment modalities targeted toward reducing VEGF levels have the potential to halt and reverse the 
hypoxic neovascular response (Smith 2008). Intravitreal injection of neutralising anti-VEGF antibodies 
had demonstrated a significant reduction in the neovascular response in animal studies (Aiello 1995). 
Higher ocular VEGF levels have been detected in the vitreous of ROP patients and are associated with 
more severe disease (Lashkari 2000, Sonmez et al 2008). Several publications have reported the 
successful treatment of infants with ROP with anti-VEGF agents (e.g. Mintz-Hittner et al 2011, Stahl et 
al 2018). 
There is no approved medicinal treatment for ROP and the current standard of care is laser ablation 
therapy, which is effective, but ablation of the retina results in restricted visual fields.

The development programme and Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific Advice 
Development program 
•  No new preclinical studies have been submitted. 
•  Biopharmaceutical development. 
For the proposed new indication, a low-volume, high-accuracy syringe for administration of a fixed 
volume of 20 µl of Lucentis® solution for injection, corresponding to a dose of 0.2 mg, for the 
treatment of the paediatric population via intravitreal injection, was developed. Development of a low-
volume, high-accuracy syringe is part of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Paediatric Investigation 
Plan (PIP) for ranibizumab (Lucentis). 
•  Clinical development programme (see Section 5.4). 
Study H2301 (RAINBOW, Core study) A randomized, open-label, three-arm parallel-group study to 
determine if intravitreal ranibizumab is superior to laser ablation therapy in the treatment of ROP. In 
addition, two doses of ranibizumab are investigated (0.1 mg and 0.2 mg).  
Study H2301E1 (RAINBOW extension) is a currently ongoing Extension Study evaluating the long-term 
efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg compared with laser therapy in treatment of 
ROP, 40 weeks post baseline visit in core study. Patients were eligible to participate in the Extension 
Study H2301E1 if they had successfully completed the 24-week Core Study H2301. 
The remainder of the Extension Study is observational. 
Both studies are part of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for 
ranibizumab (Lucentis) (PIP EMEA-000527-PIP04-13-M01). The positive opinion and report on the final 
PIP compliance check was received on 29 October 2018. 
Compliance with CHMP guidance/Scientific Advice 
A national advice was provided by the Swedish MPA on 08 June 2018 with a follow-up advice on 29 
August 2018.  
It was emphasised that it should be demonstrated that ranibizumab has no detrimental effects on 
visual function and that ranibizumab has a favourable outcome on visual function in the long-term 
compared with laser treatment. Subsequently, the clinical study protocol was amended to address 
these issues including the collection of additional visual function data (CRFB002H2301E1 v01, 31-Jul-
2018). 
3.2.  Quality aspects 
3.2.1.  Pharmaceutical Development (3.2.P.2) 
Novartis has recently developed a low-volume, high-accuracy syringe for administration of a fixed 
volume of 20 μl of Lucentis solution for injection, corresponding to a dose of 0.2 mg, for the treatment 
of the paediatric population via intravitreal injection. The low-volume high-accuracy syringe will be 
provided as a standalone device to be used in combination with Lucentis 10 mg/ml solution for 
injection in vial. The low-volume syringe will be provided together with an injection needle in the 
VISISURE device box. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 8/101 
 
 
 
 
 
The low-volume, high-accuracy syringe is sterile and intended to be used in combination with the 
registered presentations of Lucentis solution for injection in vials and the recommended devices: an 
18-G × 1½-inch filter needle and a 30-G × ½ inch injection needle.  
The syringe development consisted of a series of device prototypes leading to the final validated device 
design that meets the requirements of the device suitable to be placed on the market. This syringe 
was designed for accurate administration of a defined volume of 20 μl. 
To minimise user variability and improve consistency between injections, the syringe includes a small-
diameter barrel and a dose control feature, which ensures a fixed, pre-defined travel distance of the 
plunger. Based on the syringe design features, technical criteria and usability studies, this syringe is 
considered to be appropriate for the intravitreal delivery of the drug product to neonates.  
The functionalities of the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe and 1-ml Plastipak™ syringe from Becton 
Dickinson, a syringe that has been used with Lucentis in clinical investigations involving paediatric 
population, are substantially equivalent for the intended use. Therefore, it is expected that the safety 
and efficacy profiles for both devices would be equivalent in the intended paediatric population; 
however, only the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe is intended for commercialisation as a 
standalone device for use with the paediatric population in the European Union. 
Dose accuracy data obtained for the two syringes using the same gravimetric test and a target volume 
of 20 µl are provided below. In addition, information on compatibility of the drug product with the low-
volume, high-accuracy syringe is provided. Information on compatibility of the drug product with 1-ml 
Plastipak syringe, a syringe that has been used for administration of Lucentis solution for injection to 
the adult population, is already filed in current section 3.2.P.2 and is not provided in this section 
dedicated to information on paediatric device development.  
Dose accuracy 
Dose accuracy testing was conducted on the CE-marked low-volume, high-accuracy syringe. The 
testing was carried out on three syringe lots that were filled by the test operator with two batches of 
Lucentis solution for injection. The analytical procedure used for testing was based on a gravimetric 
determination of the amount of liquid expelled from a syringe. The testing was conducted in a manner 
and under the conditions that are representative of proposed use, such as following proposed 
instructions for use and using an 18-G × 1½-inch filter needle and a 30-G × ½-inch injection needle. 
The target volume was set at manufacture to 20 μl.  
The results show that the expelled volume for all samples tested was within the requirements set and 
consistent among the syringe lots and Lucentis batches tested. The expelled volumes observed as part 
of this testing are within the range of volumes observed for syringes used in paediatric clinical 
investigations with Lucentis with a target volume of 20 µl  
The dose accuracy results for - syringe lots used in paediatric clinical investigations show that expelled 
volumes for two target volumes for individual syringe lots remain well differentiated with a low 
incidence of overlapping volumes. 
Dosing errors/human factor study 
Information on human factor studies is provided in section 3.2.P.2, accompanied by a summary 
included in subsection 5 (‘Human factor studies conducted for low-volume, high-accuracy syringe’) of 
section 3.2.P.2.  
In brief, based on the human factors engineering evaluation studies, a comprehensive use-related risk 
analysis, a risk-benefit analysis and planned risk mitigation measures as presented in section 3.2.P.2,

Novartis considers that the low-volume high-accuracy syringe provided in the VISISURE device kit is 
reasonably safe and effective for the intended users, uses and use environments. 
Following completion of human factors engineering evaluation studies, the instructions for use 
(unbranded) and a reminder card for the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe were submitted for 
information only. 
Summary of human factor studies conducted for low-volume, high-accuracy syringe 
The human factors engineering (HFE)/usability engineering activities undertaken during the 
development of the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe for delivery of 0.02 mL as part of VISISURE 
device kit were carried out in accordance with the IEC 62366-1:2015-part 1. The VISISURE device kit 
consists of the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe, a 30G (½ inch) injection needle, instructions for 
use (IFU) and a reminder card (a supportive labelling that outlines key use steps for the syringe). 
Several HFE formative evaluation studies have been performed during the development of the 
VISISURE device kit to guide the device design and device kit labelling (that includes IFU and reminder 
card) and to gain confidence that the design has been optimized for safe and effective use. Details on 
the last two HFE formative evaluation studies, which have been performed with the devices, labelling 
and training materials similar to those of the final VISISURE device kit were submitted by the MAH. 
In parallel to optimizing the design and conducting HFE activities during the development, use-related 
risks associated with the VISISURE device kit were iteratively analysed, updated and mitigated 
according to Novartis risk management procedures following ISO 14971 standard. 
Finally, an HFE summative evaluation study was performed in four countries (UK, Spain, Germany and 
Italy) to collect evidence that the intended users are able to safely and effectively use the VISISURE 
device kit after receiving representative device training and following a representative time decay 
period. 
A total of fifteen ophthalmologists/retinal surgeons and fifteen ophthalmic assistants participated in the 
HFE summative evaluation study. The ophthalmologists/retinal surgeons were trained on the use of the 
VISISURE device kit one to seven weeks prior to the evaluation session with the training material 
corresponding to device labelling.  
The study was a non-interventional, simulated human factors evaluation requiring bilateral injection 
(two injections: one injection in each eye) in a simulated environment. The VISISURE device kit was 
made available to the participants during the evaluation session. According to the MHRA guidelines 
(Guidance for Medical Devices Including Drug-Device Combination Products, version 1.0, September 
2017), the participants were not prompted to read the device labelling just prior to the evaluation. 
The ophthalmologists/retinal surgeon participants’ ability to use the VISISURE device kit with the 
specimen of Lucentis "vial + filter needle pack" presentation (anonymized and including the 
representative double-sided leaflet for adults and preterm infants) to simulate the preparation and 
injection into a “mock-up neonate” was assessed. 
Overall, based on the evaluation, twenty-five out of thirty participants (ophthalmologists/retinal 
surgeons and ophthalmic assistants) successfully performed their respective steps without any use 
errors on the first evaluation and twenty-four out of thirty participants successfully performed the 
second evaluation without any use errors. The majority of the participants accurately delivered the 
dose of 0.02 mL within the tolerance limit. 
Specifically focusing on the dose delivery, twelve out of fifteen ophthalmologists withdrew enough drug 
and also performed the air-liquid separation and removal of air bubbles correctly to give the intended 
dose (within the intended dose tolerance limit). Three out of fifteen (20%) withdrew enough drug but 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 10/101 
 
 
 
performed the air-liquid separation step incorrectly (held the syringe not according to the IFU, i.e. 
incorrect orientation of the syringe) on both injections resulting in potential delivery of no dose to the 
patient. Later, during the root cause analysis or while looking at the instructions for use, two out of 
these three realised their use error for this step. 
All the findings of the summative study were incorporated into the comprehensive medical device risk 
assessment. The outcome of this risk assessment resulted in: 
•  Modifications of the risk control measures outlined in the IFU, reminder card and corresponding 
education support for air-liquid separation step: 
–  by emphasising (pictorially and in text) the orientation of the syringe when performing the air-
liquid separation technique 
–  by including caution statement in the IFU that non-compliance to the instructed air-liquid 
separation step in the IFU could result in an inaccurate dose and therefore strongly convey this 
message. 
• 
Elaboration of an institutional educational plan to provide an educational support to institutions 
explaining how to use the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe for Lucentis administration to the 
paediatric population. This also reinforces that the specific low-volume, high-accuracy syringe 
as part of the VISISURE device kit has to be used for the paediatric indication, as instructed in 
the Lucentis vial patient leaflet. 
Based on the updated risk assessment, a risk-benefit analysis was performed for the residual risks of 
using the VISISURE device kit. The benefits of using the VISISURE device kit, when used as intended, 
include high accuracy and high precision in delivering the prescribed 0.02 mL dose. The increase in the 
precision is by reducing the user’s variability by design and the repeatability compared to the state-of-
the-art syringes. Of the residual risk, in case the treatment effect is not satisfying (including use 
errors, which could result in administration of an incorrect dose among other reasons of unsatisfactory 
treatment), the ophthalmologist identifies disease progression during the frequent check-ups, and if 
required will apply the current standard of care – laser ablation. 
However, besides the undesirability of undue treatment delays due to inappropriate dosing of 
ranibizumab which are not mentioned by the company, it should also be considered that inappropriate 
syringe preparation before intravitreal treatment could result in intravitreal air bubbles. It has been 
reported that this may be associated with potential serious complications in premature infants with 
ROP (e.g. Sukgen et al. Int Ophtalmol. 2017. 37;1:215-9). According to the authors, when considered 
the vitreous volume of the eye of the premature baby, the presence of air bubbles would easily cause 
elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and subsequent compromised ocular perfusion; alternatively, air 
bubbles may cause sterile inflammatory reactions.  
Accordingly, the MAH was asked to repeat an evaluation of the current instructions for use, to evaluate 
whether the changes that have been made have improved the correct use of the device. This additional 
evaluation assessed the impact of the changes made to the instructions for use (IFU), the reminder 
card and corresponding training materials for the VISISURE device kit, containing the low-volume, 
high-accuracy syringe, on the use of the syringe. A particular emphasis was made on the air-liquid 
separation step. 
The evaluation was a non-interventional, simulated human factors evaluation requiring bilateral 
injection. The design of this evaluation was similar to the one used for the summative evaluation, 
including training and evaluation sessions that were separated by a decay period of 3 to 5 weeks. 
However, only ophthalmologists/retinal surgeons were evaluated as part of the HFE evaluation as 
changes made to the IFU, the reminder card and training materials affected only this user group. A 
Assessment report

total of 15 ophthalmologists/retinal surgeons participated in this HFE evaluation. Similarly to the initial 
HFE summative evaluation, this HFE formative evaluation was a non-interventional, simulated human 
factors evaluation requiring bilateral injection (two injections: one injection in each eye) in a simulated 
environment. Overall, 15 out of 15 (100%) participants performed the air-liquid separation step 
successfully. All the participants held the syringe in the correct orientation. Additionally, no new use 
errors associated with the modified IFU, RC and corresponding training material were observed 
although one new use error was observed related to the ‘assemble the injection needle onto the 
syringe step’. However, this error was likely not related to the changes made in the training materials.  
The HFE evaluation results confirm that the risk mitigation measures to update the IFU for the 
VISISURE device kit are effective and significantly improved usability of the CE-marked syringe 
included in the VISISURE device kit. Based on the HFE evaluations and comprehensive use-related risk 
analysis, the VISISURE device kit used with Lucentis vial kit is safe and effective for the intended 
users, uses and use environments. 
Compatibility 
The low-volume, high-accuracy syringe has been shown to be physically and chemically compatible 
with the drug product. The evaluation of compatibility was based on a comparison of the results of 
analysis of Lucentis (batch S0043 885607) that was either subjected to contact with a syringe 
(incubation for 1 h) or not subjected to such contact.  
The preparation of samples in syringes was conducted by following proposed instructions for use and 
using an 18-G × 1½-inch filter needle and a 30-G × ½-inch injection needle.  
The compatibility data for the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe presented in the variation are 
consistent with those provided for 1 ml syringe in the registration package for ranibizumab submitted 
in year 2006. Section [3.2.P.2] of the dossier was updated to include relevant additional data on 
appearance (subsection 4 ‘Evaluation of compatibility of low-volume, high-accuracy syringe’).  The 
data on appearance were obtained using the same batch of ranibizumab drug product as the one that 
was used to generate the compatibility data presented in section 3.2.P.2, which was provided as part 
of the variation. 
Section [3.2.P.2] of the dossier was updated to include relevant information on the device  
According to the variation guideline (2013/C 223/01), for a type I.B.IV.a.1 variation to add a CE-
marked administration device, which is not an integrated part of the primary packaging, 
documentation on leachables is not required. Leachables study is part of the pre-requisite for CE-
marking of the device and supports the general use of the device. Hence, the information was not 
provided as part of the initial submission for variation EMEA/H/C/000715/II/0074/G.  
However, section [3.2.P.2] of the dossier was updated to include information on leachables (subsection 
4 ‘Evaluation of compatibility of low-volume, high-accuracy syringe’). Observed leachables can be 
regarded as of no concern from a toxicological point of view, confirming that the syringe is suitable for 
use with the drug product to the same degree as 1 ml Plastipak™ syringe from Becton Dickinson, 
which was used in Study H2301 and is already available on the market and used for administration of 
the treatment with ranibizumab to the adult population.  
Novartis confirms that the filter needle (or ‘18-G × 1½-inch filter needle’ as mentioned in section 
3.2.P.2) co-packed in the registered ranibizumab presentation (EU/1/06/374/004) has been used in 
compatibility testing of the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe as stated in section [3.2.P.2]. Thus, this 
filter needle (Becton Dickinson blunt filter needle, reference number 305211) is considered to be 
compatible with the syringe.

The compatibility data presented are representative of and support the intended use of the VISISURE 
device kit, including the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe and the injection needle, which is fully 
compatible with all currently registered ranibizumab vial presentations. 
Labelling information and/or instructions for use (IFU) for a stand-alone device regulated under 
Directive 93/42/EEC amended by 2007/47/EC concerning medical devices were provided for the ease 
of assessment only. Therefore any subsequent revisions of these IFU are not considered regulatory 
relevant.  
3.2.2.  Regional (3.2.R) 
The drug product vial may either be co-packed with medical devices (an individual filter needle or a 
filter needle with a 1 ml syringe and an injection needle) or medical devices may be provided 
separately (a filter needle, a syringe, an injection needle). Information on the device intended for 
administration with a low volume high accuracy syringe, which is CE-marked according to the Council 
Directive 93/42/EEC, is provided in Table R-1 below. 
Table R-1 Medical device used with Lucentis solution for injection in a vial  intended for administration 
with a low volume high accuracy syringe 
Additional information on co-packed medical devices is provided in section ‘Container Closure System’ 
[3.2.P.7]. Information on the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe that is to be used for administration 
of the drug product only to a paediatric population is provided in section [3.2.P.2]. 
A reference to the CE certificate issued by the Notified Body for the low volume, high-accuracy syringe 
has been added to Table 1-1 of section [3.2.R]. In addition, a reference to the name/identity of the 
device (i.e. low-volume, high-accuracy syringe for delivery of 0.02 ml) that matches that stated on the 
EC certificate and Declaration of conformity has been added to Table 1-1 of section 3.2.R.  
The original 52 certificate that was issued on October 3, 2018 by the Notified Body (BSI Assurance UK 
Limited) located in the UK. Due to Brexit, certification for the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe was 
transferred from BSI Assurance UK Limited, a Notified Body located in the UK, to BSI Group The 
Netherlands B.V., a Notified Body located in the Netherlands. Thus, an updated EC certificate was 
issued on February 22, 2019 by the Notified Body located in the Netherlands. In addition, a new 
Declaration of conformity issued by Novartis on February 28, 2019 and replacing previously submitted 
declaration (dated October 5, 2018) is provided in section 3.2.R.  
Novartis considers that the low-volume high-accuracy syringe provided in a standalone device kit to be 
used in combination with Lucentis 10 mg/ml solution for injection in vial complies with the applicable 
regulatory requirement and is in line with regulatory guidance and feedback received throughout the 
development of the syringe.  
The MAH discussed the option to develop a pre-filled syringe in the context of providing an improved 
drug delivery solution for a safer and more suitable administration, to minimize medication errors in 
preterm infants. 
The agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) mandated the development of an age-appropriate low-
volume syringe to ensure accuracy of small volume delivery (quality measure). The binding element of 
the PIP did not mandate the development of a pre-filled syringe (PFS), as confirmed by the opinion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 13/101 
 
 
 
 
 
adopted by the PDCO, on 19-Oct-2018, confirming the compliance with all measures in the agreed PIP, 
including the quality measure based on submission of an EC certificate/Declaration of Conformity 
pertaining to the registration of the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe. 
Novartis considers the current proposal to administer Lucentis to preterm infants with retinopathy of 
prematurity (ROP) with the proposed low-volume, high-accuracy syringe adequate and justified on the 
following basis: 
• 
The entire volume of Lucentis solution has to be withdrawn from the vial for proper preparation 
and accurate delivery of the dose to both adults and pre-term infants. The lost volumes from 
the Lucentis vial presentation are small and similar for the adult and for the preterm infant 
treatment. Therefore, with the low number of candidates and the frequency of treatment for 
the preterm population, the foreseen losses are considered negligible and acceptable. 
•  A new layout of the product information has been designed providing separate and specific 
information for the treatment of preterm infants (double-sided leaflet), ensuring clarity and 
readability for both patients, parents/guardians and healthcare professionals. 
•  Results from a new (human factors engineering) HFE study for the low-volume, high-accuracy 
syringe demonstrated that the new IFU and reminder card are effective risk mitigation 
measures and have significantly improved usability. 
•  Multiple measures are being proposed to ensure correct administration and use of the low 
volume high accuracy syringe in the paediatric population, thereby minimizing medication 
errors. 
The current PFS technologies would not meet the dose accuracy requirement mandated by the PIP and 
existing technologies would not be adaptable into a pre-filled low-volume syringe. A new PFS 
development program has a number of technical challenges and uncertainties and would not 
necessarily reduce usability risks. 
Based on the above, Novartis considers administration of Lucentis using the low-volume, high-accuracy 
syringe a safe and the most suitable option in order to ensure accuracy of small volume delivery. 
After discussions with the PDCO, the agreed PIP mandated the development of an age-appropriate low 
volume syringe, but not a PFS 
An initial PIP for the condition Retinopathy of Prematurity (EMEA-000527-PIP04-13) was submitted to 
the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) on 27-May-2013 and approved on 06-Aug-2014 (EMA decision 
P/0186/2014). The PIP included two measures for completion by December 2018: 
•  A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and ocular and systemic safety of ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
and 0.1 mg compared to laser for the treatment of ROP (clinical measure); and 
•  Development of an age-appropriate low-volume syringe to ensure accuracy of small volume 
delivery (quality measure). 
The agreed PIP did not mandate development of a PFS and acknowledged that the current adult PFS 
presentation was not adapted to administer the proposed low volume to preterm infants. 
To address the quality measure of the PIP, Novartis has undertaken the development of a sterile, low-
volume, high-accuracy syringe for the administration of a fixed volume of 20 μL with high accuracy, 
corresponding to the proposed 0.2 mg dose for the treatment of preterm infants with ROP. 
The proposed method of administration using the low volume high accuracy syringe, which is planned 
to be registered as a stand-alone device and fulfils the binding quality measure of the PIP, was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 14/101 
 
 
 
discussed during a pre-submission meeting with the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency (MPA). The 
MPA agreed with Novartis that the low volume high accuracy syringe developed by Novartis was 
appropriate for the treatment of this population. MPA also agreed to the proposal of a double-sided 
leaflet, with one side providing information for indications in the adult population and the other side 
addressing the paediatric indication exclusively, in order to reduce medication errors. 
The PDCO adopted an opinion confirming the compliance of all measures in the agreed PIP, including 
the quality measure, on 19-Oct-2018 based on submission of an EC certificate/Declaration of 
Conformity pertaining to the registration of the low-volume, high-accuracy syringe for the 
administration of a fixed volume of 20 μL. 
The use of the low volume high accuracy syringe requires to empty the entire Lucentis vial content for 
accurate administration of both the adult and pre-term infant dose. 
The recommended dose of Lucentis 10 mg/mL solution for injection is 20 μL for pre-term infants and 
50 μL for adults, corresponding to a 0.2 mg dose and a 0.5 mg dose respectively. 
The preparation of the low volume high accuracy syringe for administration of a 20 μL dose of Lucentis 
in preterm infants requires a number of steps during which some drug product solution is left in the 
filter needle or used for priming. In addition, the drug product solution is also captured in the low-
volume high-accuracy syringe assembly due to presence of dead volumes in the syringe and the 
injection needle (part of VISISURE kit). Finally, in order to allow high accuracy of the syringe, the 
dosing has to be made only on the cylindrical portion of the syringe barrel in order to remove the 
variability triggered by the stopper deformation when reaching the end of the barrel. Therefore a 
higher dead volume is calculated in the low volume high accuracy syringe compared to conventional 
syringes. This would also apply to a new high accuracy PFS technology. As a consequence, to 
accommodate the preparation and injection of Lucentis with the low volume high accuracy syringe, a 
minimum volume of 0.21 mL of drug product solution in the vial is required to deliver an accurate 20 
μL dose. Thus, the entire fill volume of a vial (0.23 mL) will have to be used for preparation of a dose 
of Lucentis to be administered to preterm infants, as prompted in the VISISURE device kit IFU. 
This minimum fill volume (0.21 mL) for the low volume high accuracy syringe is very similar to the 
minimum fill volume required to prepare an adult dose with a 1 mL syringe (0.22 mL) for a 50 μL dose 
and very close to the entire fill volume of a vial (0.23 mL). Therefore, the actual discarded volumes 
from the Lucentis vial presentation are small and similar for the adult and for the preterm infant 
treatment. 
With the low number of candidates and the frequency of treatment for the preterm population, the 
foreseen losses are considered negligible and acceptable. 
The proposed product information has been designed to provide separate and specific information for 
the treatment of preterm infants 
In order to ensure clarity and readability for both patients and healthcare professionals, Novartis has 
proposed a double-sided patient leaflet for the Lucentis vial presentations, with one side of the leaflet 
providing information for all adult indications and the other side providing paediatric specific 
information exclusively. This approach has been agreed during a pre-submission meeting with the 
Swedish MPA. 
The double-sided leaflet underwent a successful focused readability test. For this test key points of 
information were selected from the adults and premature babies sides of the leaflet. The test 
demonstrated that all participants were able to find the correct side of the leaflet. The results also 
demonstrated that for both sides of the leaflet, at least 90% of the participants were able to find each 
Assessment report

Page 15/101 
 
 
 
point of key information and at least 90% of those were able to understand it. The Lucentis leaflet 
therefore fulfils the EU requirements for User Testing.  
Developing a new pre-filled low-volume syringe for use in preterm infants 
Novartis has evaluated the feasibility to adapt existing technologies, including the Lucentis adult PFS 
technology, current PFS technologies available on the market and the low volume high accuracy 
syringe, for the development of a high accuracy PFS for low volume to treat preterm infants. 
The current Lucentis PFS technology used to deliver a dose of 50 μL in indications for the adult 
population does not meet the dose accuracy requirement of the PIP for ROP in preterm infants. With 
the current adult PFS, the dose accuracy would be much wider for the preterm infant dose (at least +/-
50% for 20 μL). This is much wider than the proposed low volume high accuracy syringe dose accuracy 
for the administration of 20 μL, which complies with the PIP requirements. 
More generally, current PFS technologies available on the market are considered less capable than the 
low volume high accuracy syringe to deliver accurately a 20 μL volume and would not meet the dose 
accuracy requirements of the PIP. Therefore, a complete new paediatric PFS development using new 
technologies and new materials would be necessary and is expected to be lengthy. As a reference, the 
adult Lucentis PFS development for the 50 μL dose lasted several years and it remains to this date the 
only PFS marketed for delivering anti-VEGFs for ocular use. 
The low volume high accuracy syringe was initially developed as a class I, single use, sterile syringe, 
not intended for use as a PFS. The materials and design are not adapted for use as a PFS, considering, 
for example, the specific long-term compatibility and stability constraints of a PFS technology and 
uncertainty regarding manufacturing feasibility. To reach high accuracy, the dose control feature and 
the thin barrel design could potentially be integrated into a new PFS technology however would lead to 
similar usability risks. For instance, the same air-liquid separation step (hammer swing) would be 
required to remove air bubbles. Therefore, the reduction of use related risks for a new pre-filled low-
volume syringe as compared to the proposed syringe would have to be demonstrated in addition. 
In conclusion, the current PFS technologies would not meet the dose accuracy requirement mandated 
by the PIP and existing technologies would not be adaptable into a pre-filled low-volume syringe. A 
new PFS development program has a number of technical challenges and uncertainties and would not 
necessarily reduce usability risks. 
Measures to ensure correct administration and use of the low volume syringe in the paediatric 
population 
Novartis proposes a number of measures to ensure correct administration and use of the low volume 
high accuracy syringe in the paediatric population and thereby to minimize medication errors. These 
measures include 
• 
• 
• 
a double- sided leaflet, referring to the low volume syringe in the VISISURE kit on the side for 
guardians of babies born prematurely, 
the deregistration of the ‘vial + injection kit’ presentation (EU/1/06/374/001) at time of EC 
decision and 
the introduction of an institutional educational plan. 
Based on recent HFE study using VISISURE, it was demonstrated that the proposed risk mitigations to 
improve the VISISURE labelling and training video have been effective. These changes have 
significantly improved the correct use of the low volume high accuracy syringe compared to the 
previously provided usability data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 16/101 
 
 
 
Based on the above provided justification, Novartis considers administration of 20 μL Lucentis to 
preterm infants with ROP using the low volume high accuracy syringe a safe and the most suitable 
option in order to ensure accuracy of small volume delivery. While it may be assumed that a PFS has 
the potential for reducing risk over the use of a vial and a syringe, such a risk reduction has not been 
demonstrated to date. 
3.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been submitted. This is justified with the protein nature 
of ranibizumab and after injection to the patient’s eye ranibizumab is completely metabolised and 
adsorbed in the body. Any medicinal product that reaches water streams via eventual spills during 
application or after disposal of unused drug is expected to be very rapidly degraded and mineralised to 
CO2. Reference is made to Directive 2001/83/EC and Guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2.  
It is agreed that Ranibizumab is not likely to pose a risk to the environment and the justification for 
not submitting an ERA is accepted. 
3.4  Clinical Pharmacology

3.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Descriptive statistics of systemic ranibizumab concentrations are summarised in Table 5. The sampling 
windows were large: Day 1, within 24 hours after the first ranibizumab administration; Day 15, 
window 7 to 21 days after the first administration; and Day 29, window 22 to 28 days after the first 
administration (on Day 1). This limits the interpretability of the descriptive statistics. 
Table 2. Descriptive statistics of systemic ranibizumab concentrations (ng/ml). 
Population PK 
Data 
The popPK and the PK/PD analyses used the CRFB002H2301 (RAINBOW) study data. The RAINBOW 
study is a randomised, open-label, 3-arm, parallel-group, superiority study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg, intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg, and laser therapy for the 
treatment of ROP. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the 3 treatment arms. 
Missing data in the PK dataset were treated as missing. Concentrations below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) were also treated as missing for the population PK analysis. Data from one 
subject  who was administered 1 mg ranibizumab was not included in this analysis. Additionally, 
measurable ranibizumab PK observations after the patients were rescued by laser treatment excluded. 
All other ranibizumab PK time-points were included.  
Objectives 
The goal of this analysis was to characterise systemic exposure in patients using population PK model 
and to assess the relationship between systemic VEGF levels and PK. 
Methods 
The analysis was performed using the NONMEM software system, NONMEM 7.3.0. A previously 
developed ranibizumab population PK model for adults (Joshi et al, Genentec, Inc Report 05-1181, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 19/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2005) after allometric scaling of relevant PK parameters was used to simulate PK data, which then 
were compared with observed PK data from the ROP population. If a difference was identified, then the 
model was to be re-estimated using RAINBOW study data with patient´s weight included as a 
covariate for the model parameters.  
The handling of outliers/missing data appears adequate. PK samples were available from 49 patients in 
the 0.2 mg arm and 46 patients in the 0.1 mg arm. 
Results/conclusion 
Since using the adult model parameters, re-sampling the preterm baby’s weight as a fixed allometric 
covariate and adjusting for their creatinine clearance did not fit the data well, re-estimation of the 
model parameters for the paediatric population was performed. The same structural model was applied 
when re-estimating the preterm baby’s PK parameters. The final model parameters are shown in Table 
6 below. 
The effect of the reduced patient creatinine clearance was included in the model however the median 
value (rather than individual ones) was used for all patients because the Serum Creatinine was 
measured at each site instead of at a central lab. Additionally ~23.3 % of the observed values were 
suspiciously low (<0.01 mg/dl). 
The applicant states that for the final model the 50th percentile VPC went through the middle of the 
observed data and the range between 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles included most of the patient PK 
(Figure 2, Figure 3). The popPK model was used to calculate and then to summarise individual PK 
parameters, which are shown in the table below (Table 7). Epsilon shrinkage was reported to be 23 % 
and eta shrinkages were reported to be 23, 15 and 30 % for Cl/F V/F and Ka/F respectively. 
Conclusions 
The applicant concludes that the Visual predictive checks (VPC) indicated good model fit to the data. 
Ranibizumab PK is different in preterm babies compared to adults and required re-estimation of PK 
parameters.  The apparent half-life of ranibizumab in serum after ITV administration is equivalent to 
the vitreous elimination from the eye is approximately 6 days in the studied population, in comparison 
to 9 days in adults. Systemic Cmax in patients receiving injections of 0.1 or 0.2 mg (per eye) is 7.6 or 
16.2 fold higher than in adults receiving 0.5 mg (Cmax) in one eye and AUCinf is about 5 to 12 fold 
higher.

The utility of the popPK model is mainly for descriptive purposes to provide adequate information in 
the SmPC (t1/2, Cmax, AUC). 
The popPK model structure for ranibizumab in preterm babies with ROP was based on a previously 
developed popPK model for adults using body weight based allometric scaling on Cl/F and V/F with 
fixed exponents (0.75 and 1 for clearance and volume). Scaling of clearance using median creatinine 
clearance was also used with a fixed exponent taken from the adult model. Parameters ka, Cl/F, V/F 
and residual error were re-estimated. The scaling using median creatinine clearance and a fixed 
exponent from the adult model becomes a constant with a value of close to 1 (same for all children 
regardless of differences in age, weight or actual creatinine clearance) and can be removed from the 
model. From the visual predictive checks (VPC) provided it is difficult to interpret the adequacy of the 
model since percentiles of the observed data were not included. 
The applicant was requested to provide updated VPCs for the 0.1 and 0.2 mg dose also showing lines 
for the percentiles of the observed data on linear and log scale, as well as a pcVPC (on linear and log 
scale) (see Bergstrand et al. The AAPS journal, 2011, 13.2: 143-151). Figures of the VPCs zoomed in 
at early time points were requested.  
The applicant has provided updated plots (Figure 4 above). It would have been more useful if the 
updated VPCs had more than 3 bins. Overall, the previous VPC combined with the new VPC are 
deemed adequate. 
Clearance appears to be estimated similarly as to the adult model while volume of distributions differs 
around 10 -fold. 
For young children, ontogeny also needs to be considered. The model does not include ontogeny which 
may be a reason for difference in volume. Overall, based on the VPCs, the model is deemed adequate 
for descriptive purposes. 
The PK data is sparsely sampled and there is shrinkage (between 20 and 30 %) which may lead to bias 
in post-hoc predicted estimates. Thus, there may be bias in the individual concentrations used in the 
linear PK/PD model.

3.4.3.  PK/PD modelling 
The aim of the PK/PD analysis was to evaluate the systemic free VEGF concentrations in relation to 
ranibizumab concentration.  
The summary statistics of VEGF are described in Table 8. There are no clear trends in time for VEGF 
concentrations. A lower median value at day 15 in the Ranibizumab arms compared to laser therapy as 
well as lower median at day 29 for the 0.2 mg arm compared to the 0.1 arm and laser therapy can be 
seen but min, max and overall data are a largely overlapping (Figure 4).  
Further, a linear model relating ranibizumab concentrations to VEGF concentrations was applied and 
calculated ranibizumab concentrations were plotted against the observed VEGF concentrations (Figure 
5). The linear model indicated no significant correlation between VEGF concentrations and ranibizumab 
concentrations (p=0.600; Table 9).

VEGF data from very few patients have been studied, especially in the ranibizumab arms. The median 
appears to be lower at day 15 in the Ranibizumab arms and the laser therapy arm compared to day 1. 
VEGF samples have been taken pre-dose, day 15 and day 29 (+/- 7 day window for 15 and 29 day 
dose). Most VEGF samples appear to be sampled at or close to the intended day 15 and day 29 thus, 
very sparse information regarding the VEGF concentrations between pre-dose and day 15 are 
available. 
Individual plots of VEGF vs time have been provided. 
It is noteworthy that the plasma concentrations of ranibizumab 0.2 mg in the pre-term infants are 16-
fold higher (Cmax, from popPK analysis) than those observed in adults, however, the impact on the 
VEGF concentration is unclear, masked by the large interindividual variation. The MAH was requested 
to further discuss the rationale for selecting the 0.2 mg dose considering the apparent 16-fold higher 
systemic exposure in the paediatric population as compared to the adult population, as well as discuss 
local exposure.  
In response to the RSI, the MAH has provided this rationale for selecting the 0.2 mg dose. The 
proportion of patients achieving treatment success was highest with ranibizumab 0.2 mg (80.0%), 
followed by ranibizumab 0.1 mg (75.0%) and laser (66.2%). The difference in treatment success was 
14.7% for ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared to laser and 9.3% for ranibizumab 0.1 mg compared to 
laser. A higher numeric benefit for patients treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg as compared with 0.1 mg 
was also observed for the secondary endpoints (e.g. switch, active ROP and unfavourable structural 
outcomes. No dose-related trends were observed for safety. However, the long-term safety would 
need to be further followed. Most of the patients received only one injection per eye, which provides 
some reassurance considering the higher systemic exposure observed as compared with the adult 
population.  
The individual concentrations from the popPK model were used in the linear PK/PD model. Shrinkage 
was between 20 and 30 % in the popPK model which may lead to bias in the individual predicted 
ranibizumab concentrations.  The linear VEGF model would indicate that systemic VEGF levels are not 
lowered despite the higher systemic ranibizumab concentrations. Since there is eta and epsilon 
shrinkage between 20-30 % in the popPK model the results from the PK/PD analysis may be biased. 
Furthermore, the sampling times points (pre-dose day 15 and day 29), the few numbers of subjects 
studied as well as some samples being analysed after 15 months (where stability of VEGF cannot be 
ensured), together raises uncertainties regarding systemic VEGF concentrations in these young 
children. In addition, PK model evaluation plots may indicate a model underestimation of high plasma 
concentrations. The possible effect on such bias in model predictions, and the relationship between 
VEFG and ranibizumab concentrations has not been discussed.  
From the individual plots as well as for the previously provided linear PK/PD model however, there 
does not appear to be a trend for VEGF. Information regarding this can be provided in the SmPC. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019

PK/PD analysis of VEGF can however not support safety regarding long-term neurodevelopmental 
outcome. 
3.4.4.  Immunogenicity 
As an exploratory objective, the presence of anti-ranibizumab antibodies in patients with ROP initially 
treated with ranibizumab was assessed, provided there was sufficient volume remaining from serum 
PK samples. Due to sample volume limitations, if a sample screened positive and there was not 
adequate sample for a confirmatory assay, the sample was considered positive, as a conservative 
approach. 
The incidence of antibodies against ranibizumab was low (< 10%). Anti-ranibizumab antibodies after 
treatment with ranibizumab 0.2 mg were detected in 7.0% (3/43), 2.4% (1/42) and 9.7% (3/31) of 
patients on Days 1 (sampling within 24 hours post-dose), 15, and 29, respectively. The corresponding 
percentages after ranibizumab 0.1 mg treatment were 4.5% (2/44), 5.3% (2/38) and 8.3% (2/24). As 
an immunogenic response is not expected within 24 hours after a single ranibizumab dose, Day 1 
results suggest a low incidence of pre-existing anti-ranibizumab antibodies, and data across all days 
suggest a low incidence of treatment emergent antibodies. 
It is not known whether clinically relevant differences in response/adverse events between patients 
with and without a positive antibody response could be identified.  
Overall, as only few ADA positive results have been confirmed, no relationship can be established 
between positive ADA and efficacy outcomes. 
3.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The popPK model is needed to provide adequate information to section 5.2 in the SmPC. A 12-fold 
higher AUC and a 16 fold higher Cmax in ROP patients compared to adults was seen.  From the 
individual plots as well as for the previously provided linear PK/PD model, there does not appear to be 
a trend for VEGF. Information regarding the exposure of ranibizumab as well as the result form the 
PK/PD analysis can be provided in section 5.2 in the SmPC. The PK/PD analysis of VEGF can however 
not support safety regarding long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. 
The proportion of patients achieving treatment success was highest with ranibizumab 0.2 mg (80.0%), 
followed by ranibizumab 0.1 mg (75.0%) and laser (66.2%). A higher numeric benefit for patients 
treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg as compared with 0.1 mg was also observed for the secondary 
endpoints (e.g. switch, active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes. No dose-related trends were 
observed for safety. However, the long-term safety would need to be further followed. Most of the 
patients received only one injection per eye, which provides some reassurance considering the higher 
systemic exposure observed as compared with the adult population.  
3.5.  Clinical efficacy 
3.5.1.  Main study 
Results of the Core Study CRFB002H2301 presented in the Clinical Study Report were submitted 
earlier in 2018 as part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for Lucentis and assessed as an Article 
46 process (EMA/H/C/715/P46). 
There are three analyses planned in the RAINBOW Extension Study: 
• 
Interim analysis 1 (IA1) will provide descriptive statistics for a subset of patients to evaluate 
ocular structural abnormalities.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 27/101 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Interim analysis 2 (IA2) will be conducted on all patients at their 2 years’ corrected age to 
report on the progress of the study to the scientific community.  
The final analysis will be conducted at the completion of the study. 
The purpose of the IA1 is to provide long-term data on structural abnormalities at 9 months after start 
of treatment in the subset of patients for which this data is available, as outlined in the clinical 
measure of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP EMEA- 000527-PIP04-13-M01). The PIP requires that 
the analysis should include at least half of the patients enrolled in the Core Study CRFB002H2301. 
The IA1 was performed after the last patient had completed the last visit in the Core Study which was 
14 December 2017. The cut-off date used for this first interim analysis was 31 December 2017. At the 
time of this cut-off, 144 patients had either completed (143 patients) the Week 40 visit in the 
Extension Study (corresponding to 40 weeks after the first study treatment in the Core Study) or had 
discontinued from the Extension Study prior to this time point (1 patient). Key results for this subset of 
144 patients are reported in this first interim analysis (IA1) with the Extension Study currently 
ongoing. 
The extension CRFB002H2301E1 was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 
intravitreal ranibizumab compared with laser ablation therapy in patients with ROP who successfully 
completed the Core Study. 
Objectives 
Core Study 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg has 
superior efficacy to laser therapy in the treatment of ROP as measured by treatment success, defined 
as the absence of active ROP and absence of unfavourable structural outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks 
after starting study treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. 
The study defined active ROP as the presence of vessel dilation of plus disease in at least 2 quadrants 
(with some persisting tortuosity being allowed) or extra-retinal vessels extending from the retina into 
the vitreous and judged to be a sign of active ROP disease. Unfavourable structural outcomes were 
defined by the presence of any of the following features: retrolental membrane obscuring the view of 
the posterior pole, substantial temporal retinal vessel dragging causing abnormal structural features/ 
macular ectopia, posterior retinal fold involving the macula, or retinal detachment involving the 
macula. 
Treatment success was achieved if patients did not experience any of the following conditions: 
–  death, 
– 
requirement of intervention for ROP in either eye with a treatment modality other than the 
modality of the first investigational treatment, 
–  active ROP in either eye, 
–  unfavourable structural outcomes in either eye. 
Key secondary objectives of the study were: 
– 
to demonstrate that intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg has superior efficacy to laser therapy in 
the treatment of ROP as measured by the absence of active ROP and absence of unfavourable 
structural outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks after starting investigational treatment, as 
assessed by the Investigator, 
– 
to demonstrate that intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg had superior efficacy to intravitreal 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg in the treatment of ROP as measured by the absence of active ROP and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 28/101 
 
 
 
absence of unfavourable structural outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks after starting 
investigational treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. 
Other secondary objectives were: 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
to evaluate the time to intervention with a second modality for ROP or development of 
unfavourable structural outcome or death, 
to evaluate the recurrence of ROP receiving any post-baseline intervention at 24 weeks or 
before, 
to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg in 
the treatment of ROP as assessed by ocular examination, monitoring of adverse events (AEs) 
throughout the study, and by the assessment of length, weight, head circumference and lower 
leg length at Baseline, Day 85, and Day 169, 
to evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravitreal ranibizumab in patients with 
ROP, as evaluated by sparse-sampling population PK methods, 
to evaluate the effects of investigational treatment on systemic VEGF levels in patients with 
ROP, as evaluated by sparse-sampling population concentration-response methods, 
to assess the number of ranibizumab administrations needed in the treatment of patients with 
ROP. 
Extension Study 
The absence of ocular structural abnormalities was evaluated as defined by the absence of all of the 
following fundus features in both eyes at or before the Week 40 visit (40 weeks after the  first study 
treatment in the Core Study H2301): 
– 
substantial temporal retinal vessel dragging causing abnormal structural features/ macular 
ectopia 
– 
retrolental membrane obscuring the view of the posterior pole 
–  posterior retinal fold involving the macula 
– 
retinal detachment involving the macula 
Additional objectives of interim analysis 1 were: 
– 
to explore the absence of active ROP in both eyes at Week 40, as defined by the absence of all 
of the following features: 
o  vessel dilatation of plus disease in at least 2 quadrants (some persisting tortuosity is 
allowed) 
o  extra-retinal vessels extending from the retina into the vitreous and judged to be a 
– 
– 
– 
sign of active ROP disease 
to explore the recurrence of ROP at or before Week 40 
to explore the number of ranibizumab injections 
to explore the safety outcomes by analysing the type, frequency and severity of ocular and 
non-ocular adverse events. 
Study design 
Core Study 
This was a randomised, multicenter, open-label, 3-arm, parallel-group, superiority study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg, intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg, and laser 
therapy for the treatment of ROP. The study consisted of a screening period (screening and 
randomization could occur up to 3 days before the administration of the first investigational 
treatment), followed by a treatment and follow-up period (Day 1 to Day 169). Randomization was 
stratified by ROP zone (in the worst eye) and by geographic region.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 29/101 
 
 
 
Patients were randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to receive 0.1 or 0.2 mg intravitreal ranibizumab or laser 
therapy at Baseline. Re-treatment with ranibizumab at the same dose at least 28 days after the 
previous ranibizumab treatment in either eye was allowed if there were signs of ROP worsening.  
During the study, a patient could receive rescue treatment (a study treatment modality different from 
the initially assigned treatment received at Baseline) in the event of unsatisfactory response to the 
initial randomised treatment, i.e., a patient randomised to ranibizumab 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg could receive 
laser therapy in either eye, and a patient randomised to laser therapy could receive ranibizumab 0.2 
mg in either eye. In patients randomised to laser who received rescue ranibizumab, re-treatment with 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg was allowed. Only the eye with worsening of ROP was re-treated. If both eyes had 
these signs, then both eyes were re-treated. 
The MAH was requested to clarify when unresponsive patients received retreatment with the same 
modality and when they were switched to another treatment modality and how standardization of this 
process was assured. In response to the RSI, the MAH explained that infants were retreated with the 
baseline treatment or switched over to a different treatment modality based on investigator’s decision. 
No pre-defined criteria were established. Accordingly, no recommendations can be made in the SmPC 
in this respect. However, the MAH has updated the wording for section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to 
limit the administration of ranibizumab up to three injections, which is acceptable.  
See also Treatments section below for further detail on the retreatment and rescue treatment protocol. 
Extension Study 
Ranibizumab as study treatment was permitted for eligible eyes up to and including the Week 40 visit 
(Epoch 1), corresponding to 40 weeks after a patient received the first study treatment in  the  Core 
Study  CRFB002H2301.  Treatment  with  ranibizumab  was  permitted  either  as  re-treatment for 
patients who had received ranibizumab as the last treatment prior to joining the  Extension Study or 
as switch treatment for patients who only received laser therapy in the Core Study CRFB002H2301 and 
required additional treatment in the Extension Study. 
Patients who  required  switch  treatment  in  the  Extension Study  were  administered  ranibizumab  0.2 
mg.  A  maximum  of  3  ranibizumab  injections  in  each  eye  were  allowed  during  the  combined  time 
period of the Core Study plus Epoch 1 of the Extension Study. The remainder of the Extension Study 
(Epoch 2) is observational. 
The overall design of the study is summarised in Figure 8.

Figure 6. Study design. 
Study population 
Core Study 
The study population consisted of male and female preterm infants with bilateral ROP who required 
treatment. Approximately 180 patients were planned to be randomised, to provide at least 
48 evaluable patients in each of the 3 treatment arms, i.e. at least 144 evaluable patients in total. 
Inclusion criteria 
Patients eligible for inclusion had to fulfil all of the following criteria prior to receiving the first 
investigational treatment: 
1.  Signed informed consent from parent(s) or legal guardian(s), in compliance with local 
requirements, 
2.  Male or female preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g, and 
3.  Bilateral ROP with 1 of the following retinal findings in each eye: 
• Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or 
• Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or 
• AP-ROP. 
Exclusion criteria 
Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria prior to receiving the first investigational treatment were 
not eligible for inclusion in this study. No additional exclusions were allowed to be applied by the 
Investigator, in order to ensure that the study population was representative of all eligible patients. 
Investigational treatment not clinically appropriate for the patients who had: 
1.  ROP disease characteristic in either eye other than that listed in Section 9.3.1 at the time of the 
first investigational treatment, or 
2.  A history of hypersensitivity (either the patient or the mother) to any of the investigational 
treatments or to drugs of similar chemical classes. 
Risk of confounding efficacy and/or safety assessments in patients who: 
3.  Received any previous surgical or nonsurgical treatment for ROP (e.g., ablative laser therapy or 
cryotherapy, vitrectomy), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 31/101 
 
 
 
 
4.  Been previously exposed to any intravitreal or systemic anti-VEGF agent (either the patient or the 
mother during this child’s pregnancy), 
5.  Used (either the patient or the mother) other investigational drugs as part of another clinical 
study (other than vitamins and minerals) within 30 days or within 5 half-lives of the other 
investigational drug, whichever was longer, 
6.  Ocular structural abnormalities that were assessed by the Investigator to have had a clinically 
significant impact on study assessments, 
7.  Active ocular infection within 5 days before or on the day of first investigational treatment 
8.  A history of hydrocephalus requiring treatment, 
9.  A history of any other neurological conditions that are assessed by the Investigator to have a 
significant risk of severe impact on visual function, or 
10.  Any other medical conditions or clinically significant comorbidities or personal circumstances that 
were assessed by the Investigator to have a clinically relevant impact on study participation, any 
of the study procedures, or on efficacy assessments (e.g. poor life expectancy, pupil not able to 
be adequately dilated, unable to comply with the visit schedule). 
The inclusion criteria aimed to capture preterm infants (regardless the gestational age) with a severity 
of ROP that would be amenable to treatment. According the International Classification for Retinopathy 
of Prematurity classification criteria includes localization (zone I, zone II, zone III), severity (stage 1, 
2, 3, 4 or 5), extent criteria (dividing the retinal surface in 12 sections) and the presence or absence of 
plus disease.   Patients were recruited on the basis that they had a Type 1 ROP (in need of treatment 
according to current guidelines applicable in Europe or similar) and placed in either Zone I with any 
stage with plus disease, Zone I with stage 3 without plus disease, and Zone II with stage 2 or 3 with 
plus disease.  
Images taken both by RetCam digital photography and/or indirect ophthalmoscopy were used for the 
visualization of the fundus. It is expected that some patients were diagnosed and followed up by using 
indirect ophthalmoscopy and in some patients depending on the conditions of the study site and/or the 
investigator preference RetCam digital photographs were performed. It is not clear if differences in the 
method used for the selection may result in relevant differences in the final population recruited 
(according to severity, gestational age, or demographic characteristics).  
Accordingly, the MAH was requested to provide the number and characteristics of the patients 
separately, in accordance with the method used and clarify to what degree patients were evaluated 
with one or both methods and whether there was a notable difference in outcome between the 2 
methods for evaluation. However, in response, the MAH explained that most of the infants included 
were evaluated by either of the two methods (interchangeably) so that a separate analysis by method 
would not be informative. 
Treatments 
Test product, dose and mode of administration: intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg. Patients received their randomised treatment on Day 1. Re-treatment with 
ranibizumab for either eye occurred for worsening of ROP at least 28 days after the previous 
ranibizumab treatment in that eye. Up to 2 re-treatments with ranibizumab per eye to treat ROP 
recurrence were allowed. The dose used was the same as the dose to which the patient was 
randomised. Only the eye with worsening of ROP was re-treated. If both eyes had these signs, then 
both eyes were re-treated. 
Reference therapy, dose and mode of administration: laser ablation therapy (hereafter laser therapy). 
For patients who received initial laser therapy on Day 1, the Investigator decided at the Day 2, Day 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 32/101 
 
 
 
 
 
and Day 8 assessments if supplementary laser treatment was necessary for any eye. Supplementary 
laser treatment had to be performed within the next 3 days of the Investigator’s decision. If at the Day 
8 assessment the Investigator decided that supplementary laser treatment was not necessary for 
either eye, no further laser treatment was allowed for the patient from this time point onwards. 
The two investigated ranibizumab doses represent 20 % or 40 % of the ranibizumab dose 
administered per eye in adult ocular indications. With bilateral administration of the doses to be 
investigated, the total amount of ranibizumab administered to a ROP patient was lower than that 
administered unilaterally in adults. 
The two doses were chosen to allow the evaluation of likely safe and efficacious doses in patients with 
ROP, based on modelling and simulation to assess the benefit–risk using predicted exposure levels and 
a PK model scaled for infants. The model assumes that: 
–  Potential efficacy increases when ocular exposure (as estimated by vitreous area under the 
curve AUC) increases 
–  Potential toxicity increases when systemic exposure (as estimated by serum AUC and 
maximum serum concentration Cmax) increases 
Ocular exposure in neonates after intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg was expected to be similar to that 
seen in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration in adults (i.e., ranibizumab 0.5 mg) and 
similar to the ocular exposure estimated by the model following intravitreal bevacizumab 0.625 mg, as 
was administered in the BEAT-ROP study (Mintz-Hittner et al 2011).  
Systemic exposure in neonates after bilateral intravitreal ranibizumab with doses as low as 0.1 mg was 
estimated to be greater than that in adult patients. However, bilateral intravitreal ranibizumab doses 
up to 0.3 mg were estimated to have less systemic exposure than that following bilateral bevacizumab 
0.625 mg, as was administered in the BEAT-ROP study (Mintz-Hittner et al 2011). Although there is no 
clear association between systemic exposure and clinical adverse effects, it would be desirable to 
minimise systemic ranibizumab exposure in the vulnerable premature neonatal population. 
Despite uncertainties of the modelling and simulation approach, it was estimated that bilateral 
intravitreal ranibizumab doses of 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg may have acceptable benefit–risk ratios based on 
clinical interpretation of the predicted ocular and systemic exposures. Published reports successfully 
treating ROP with ranibizumab monotherapy have used doses between 0.2 mg and 0.3 mg per eye 
(Castellanos et al 2013, Hoerster et al 2013, Lin et al 2012). There have also been reports of clinical 
efficacy in ROP with intravitreal bevacizumab doses as low as 20 % of the adult dose (0.25 mg, in 
combination with laser therapy) and 30 % of the adult dose (0.375 mg monotherapy) (Harder et al 
2011, Kim et al 2014). It was estimated that anti-VEGF doses lower than the majority of published 
reports could be efficacious with fewer adverse effects. 
As also discussed in the clinical pharmacology section, the MAH was requested to further discuss the 
rationale for selecting the 0.2 mg dose over the 0.1 mg dose both from a safety and efficacy 
standpoint including the apparent 16-fold higher systemic exposure in the paediatric population as 
compared to the adult population, as well as the local exposure. In response, the applicant has 
discussed that the 0.1 mg dose would give a lower vitreous exposure compared to adults while the 0,2 
mg dose would provide exposures in the same range as in adults. Furthermore, the results in terms of 
treatment success rate seem to offer some support to the choice (see below). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the absence of active ROP and absence of unfavourable structural 
outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks after starting study treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. 
To achieve this outcome, patients could not fulfil any of the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 33/101 
 
 
 
•  death at or before the 24-week assessment visit, 
•  required intervention for ROP at or before the 24-week assessment visit with a treatment modality 
other than the modality of the first investigational treatment, 
•  had active ROP in either eye at the 24-week assessment visit as defined by the presence of any of 
the following features: 
–  vessel dilatation of plus disease in at least 2 quadrants (some persisting tortuosity was 
allowed), 
–  extra-retinal vessels extending from the retina into the vitreous and judged to be a sign of 
active ROP disease, 
•  had unfavourable structural outcomes in either eye at or before 24-week assessment visit as 
defined by the presence of any of the following features: 
– 
– 
retrolental membrane obscuring the view of the posterior pole, 
substantial temporal retinal vessel dragging causing abnormal structural features/ macular 
ectopia, 
–  posterior retinal fold involving the macula, 
– 
retinal detachment involving the macula. 
A patient could be defined as a ‘success’ (favourable outcome) or ‘failure’ (unfavourable outcome) for 
each of the criteria above. Patients were defined as a ‘success’ for the primary efficacy variable only if 
they were a ‘success’ for each component. Consequently, a patient was defined as a ‘failure’ for the 
primary efficacy variable if they were defined as a ‘failure’ for at least one of the criteria above. 
Secondary efficacy variables included: 
•  the criteria that a patient could not fulfil to be a treatment success: 
–  death from any cause at or before the 24-week assessment visit, 
– 
requirement of intervention for ROP in either eye at or before the 24-week assessment visit 
with a treatment modality other than the modality of the first investigational treatment, 
–  active ROP in either eye at the 24-week assessment visit, 
–  unfavourable structural outcomes in either eye at or before 24-week assessment visit, 
•  the time after the first investigational treatment to the first occurrence of one of the following: 
–  death, 
– 
intervention for ROP with a treatment modality other than the modality of the first 
investigational treatment, 
–  an unfavourable structural outcome in either eye, 
•  requirement of none, 1, 2 or 3 ranibizumab treatments in each eye by patient, 
•  recurrence of ROP receiving any post-baseline intervention at 24 weeks or before. 
The presence of fundus features was assessed in both eyes by the Investigator at all study visits, using 
images taken by RetCam digital photography and/or as assessed by indirect ophthalmoscopy, 
according to protocol. 
Safety was assessed based on AEs, vital signs, physical findings, hospitalisation, and requirement for 
respiratory support. 
Sample size 
The sample size was initially calculated to 300 patients randomised 1:1:1 to ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser. The planned sample size was later reduced to approximately 180 
patients, following approval by the EMA to modify an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). The 
sample size of 180 was based on a power of 80 % to show superiority of ranibizumab 0.2 mg against 
laser therapy (92 % for 300 patients) and assuming a drop-out rate of 20 %. The sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 34/101 
 
 
 
 
calculations were based on a Cochran−Mantel−Haenszel test stratified by ROP zone. Event rates were 
based on published rates from the BEAT-ROP study for the recurrence of ROP at 54 weeks 
postmenstrual age using intravitreal bevacizumab (Mintz-Hittner et al 2011): 
•  Zone I 
Laser – 42.4 % 
o 
o  Ranibizumab 0.2 mg – 6.5 % 
•  Zone II  
Laser – 12.5 % 
o 
o  Ranibizumab 0.2 mg – 5.1 % 
Changing the sample size during the conduct of a study may cause suspicion that the time of study 
termination is data driven. Because the RAINBOW study failed to show statistical significance in the 
primary endpoint, this is not considered an issue. 
Randomisation 
At Visit 1 (Screening Visit), all eligible patients were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the 3 treatment arms 
via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation was stratified by ROP zone in the worst eye 
and geographic region based on neonatal mortality rate. 
The randomisation procedure was appropriate. 
Blinding (masking) 
The investigators and patients/parents/legal guardians were unmasked to the treatments 
administered. However, to minimise the potential impact of treatment knowledge, randomisation data 
and aggregated statistical analysis by treatment was kept confidential from the Clinical Trial Team 
(CTT) until the database was locked for the primary analysis. Fundus images taken by RetCam digital 
photography were analysed at a reading that were blinded to the dose of ranibizumab administered.  
The study was open-label, but there were measures to minimise bias related to treatment knowledge. 
Fundus image analysis is, however, always prone to subjective interpretation. It is noted that the 
readings were blinded to the dose of ranibizumab administered. It is not possible to blind images of the 
laser treatment group. 
Statistical methods 
A 3-step sequential testing procedure was used for primary (ranibizumab 0.2 mg against laser) and 
the 2 key secondary comparisons (ranibizumab 0.1 mg against laser and ranibizumab 0.2 mg against 
0.1 mg). Under this testing procedure, the primary comparison was conducted at the first step 
followed by the key secondary comparisons if the primary comparison was statistically significant. If 
the efficacy comparison at any step was not statistically significant, the remaining efficacy comparisons 
were assessed descriptively. Otherwise the comparison continued to the next step. 
The primary and secondary efficacy variables were analysed for the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS 
consisted of all randomised patients to whom treatment regimen had been assigned and data was 
analysed using the intent-to-treat principle. 
All hypotheses were tested at a pre-specified level of significance (two-sided α=0.05). This testing 
procedure controlled familywise type I error rate at a pre-specified level of significance because, for 
each hypothesis, testing was conditional upon rejecting all hypotheses earlier in the sequence.

The comparisons were performed using the stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test for binomial 
proportions. Stratification was based on ROP zone, derived at randomisation from the Case Report 
Form (CRF) page. Mantel–Haenszel odds ratios, adjusted one-sided p-values and their 2-sided 95 
% CIs were also presented. A sensitivity analysis was performed by repeating the primary efficacy 
analysis with the stratification by ROP zone information obtained from the Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT). 
At each step, if superiority was claimed, Mantel–Haenszel odds ratio, adjusted one-sided p-value and 
the two-sided 95 % CI of the comparison were presented. The adjusted one-sided p-value was 
calculated as follows for the primary objective; the same approach was taken for the key secondary 
objectives: 
–  0.5*(two-sided p-value) if the Mantel–Haenszel odds ratio of ranibizumab 0.2 mg to laser was 
in favour of ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
–  1-0.5*(two-sided p-value) if the Mantel–Haenszel odds ratio of ranibizumab 0.2 mg to laser 
was in favour of laser. 
Missing data to be used for the statistical inference of the primary variable was imputed by eye. 
Imputation of missing data was only undertaken if the value of the primary variable was missing. 
The primary analysis of the hypotheses was undertaken after imputing missing values related to the 
occurrence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at Week 24, assuming the following: 
– 
– 
If the last non-missing value of a criterion was ‘success’, then the missing value of the criterion 
at Week 24 remained missing. 
If the last non-missing value of a criterion was ‘failure’, then the missing value of the 
component at Week 24 was imputed as ‘failure’. 
The imputed value of the primary variable was then derived from the imputed values of the individual 
components. The primary analysis was undertaken after imputing missing values of the primary 
variable at 24 weeks. 
The primary efficacy variable was also assessed by a binary logistic regression model by using 
treatment group and ROP zone at randomisation from the CRF as factors. The odds ratio (OR) of the 
primary variable was displayed (with values > 1 in favour of ranibizumab) with its two-sided 95 % CI 
and one-sided p-value. If the number of events of some cells was very small (< 5 for at least one cell), 
then exact logistic regression was used to assess the primary efficacy variable. 
Sensitivity analyses  
For the primary efficacy analysis, missing data on the occurrence of active ROP and unfavourable 
structural outcomes at Week 24 were imputed as follows: if the last non-missing value of a criterion 
was ‘success’, then the missing value at Week 24 stayed missing (imputation rule 1). 
The robustness of the primary analysis was assessed by the following sensitivity analyses: 
•  Repeating the primary analyses using the Per-Protocol Set 
•  Repeating the primary analyses without imputing data missing at Week 24 
•  Repeating the primary analyses imputing data missing at Week 24 by ”success” 
•  Repeating the primary analyses imputing data missing at Week 24 by ”failure” 
•  Repeating the primary analyses with imputation rule 2  
A pre-specified sensitivity analysis with an alternative imputation rule (imputation rule 2) was 
performed in which missing outcomes of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at Week 24 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 36/101 
 
 
 
were imputed from the results at the Week 20 visit. This was based on the results of prior studies 
(Mintz-Hittner et al 2011, Stahl et al 2018), which concluded that recurrence with structural 
unfavourable endpoints occurred at 6.2±5.7 weeks after laser treatment, or before 100 days after 
ranibizumab treatment, respectively, indicating the stability of active ROP and unfavourable structural 
outcomes between Week 20 and Week 24.  
•  Sensitivity analysis using logistic regression 
•  Sensitivity analysis using ROP Zone information from the Interactive Response Technology. 
All secondary efficacy analyses were performed based on observed data unless otherwise specified. No 
imputation of missing data was undertaken on secondary efficacy variables. − No interim analysis was 
performed. 
The statistical methods used were adequate. 
Results 
Recruitment/Numbers analysed 
Core Study 
A total of 225 patients from 87 sites in 26 countries were enrolled and randomised. The majority of 
patients (218 patients, 96.9 %) received initial (baseline) investigational treatment; study treatment in 
the follow-up phase was completed by 89.3 % of patients overall, with a slightly higher proportion of 
patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (71 patients, 92.2 %) and ranibizumab 0.2 mg (66 patients, 
89.2 %) groups than in the laser group (64 patients, 86.5 %). 
All patients of the Randomised Set were also included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), and 80.4 % of all 
randomised patients were included in the Per-Protocol Set (181 patients overall), with a higher 
proportion of patients in both ranibizumab groups (86.5 % for ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 81.8 % for 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg) than in the laser group (73.0 %).  
Seven patients were randomised but did not receive initial treatment and were discontinued from the 
study. These patients were not included in the Safety Set for safety analyses as they did not receive 
any study treatment but were included in the Full Analysis Set for efficacy analyses.  
The FAS population included 225 patients and the Safety Population 118 patients since 7 patients did 
not receive treatment. In total, 17 patients discontinued after the initial treatment at baseline (17 in 
total, including 12 deaths). The distribution of discontinuations was comparable across the treatment 
groups.  
Patient disposition is summarised in the table below.

Extension Study 
Of the 225 patients randomised into the Core Study CRFB002H2301, 218  patients were treated, and 
201 patients (89.3%) completed the Core Study. – At  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  for  the present 
interim  analysis (31 December 2017),  144  patients  had  either  completed  Week 40 visit (143 
patients) or had been discontinued in the Extension Study prior to Week 40 visit (1 patient 
discontinued due to death). 
Conduct of the study 
Baseline data 
Core Study 
Patient demographic data are summarised in the tables below. The demographic and disease 
characteristics of the study population were similar across the treatment group. The majority of 
patients were Caucasian (59.1 %), and there was a comparable proportion of males and females. 
Mean gestational age was 26.1 weeks and mean chronological age at baseline was 10.9 weeks. Mean 
birth weight was 836.4 g, with nearly half of patients weighing ≤ 750 g (48.4 %) at birth.  
Treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to baseline demographics. 
Patients were stratified by Region (Region 1: Estonia, Japan, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland, United Kingdom, Hungary, 
Slovakia (Slovak Republic), United States, and Taiwan; Region 2: Malaysia, Russia, Romania, Mexico, 
Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, and India).

Disease characteristics at baseline are summarised in Table 13. In total, 38.2 % of patients were 
classified ROP Zone I and 61.3 % were classified ROP Zone II. AP-ROP was reported for 30 patients 
(13.3 %). The most frequent baseline ROP disease classification was Zone II Stage 3+ (60.0 %), 
followed by Zone I Stage 3+ (16.4 %) and Zone I AP-ROP (12.9 %). 
The studied population included patients with bilateral ROP with Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, 
or Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity). Of note, 
the sought indication in the MAH’s proposed SmPC was initially considerably broader. However, in the 
response to the first RSI, the proposed indication has been updated to reflect the patient population 
included in the study. In addition, this indication is now more consistent with recommendations for 
treatment stated in recent literature.  
Most of baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced over treatment arms. 
Females represented 52.4% of the population. Gestational age at birth ranged from 23 to 32 weeks 
(mean 26.1 weeks), with a mean birth weight of 836.5 g (from 316 g to 1610 g). Infants were 
recruited at 10.8 weeks of chronological age (ranged from 3.3 to 30.3 weeks). The majority of subjects 
were Caucasian (59%) followed by Asian (32%) and African American subjects (3.1%). Overall, 60% 
of patients were recruited in Region 1 and 40% in Region 2. Patients from Region 1 and Region 2 
exhibit a certain degree of heterogeneity, as they come from centers with wide differences in neonatal 
care, screening of the condition and the characteristics of the infants at risk.  
The MAH was requested to describe the baseline characteristics of preterm infants from Region 1 and 
Region 2 separately and discuss the differences in response to treatment. According to the MAH, 
Region 1 is representative of the EU population. Of the 225 patients, 134 (60%) were recruited from 
Region 1, which included Estonia, Japan, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Greece, Italy, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland, United Kingdom, Hungary, Slovakia, United States,

and Taiwan. Of the 134 patients in Region 1, 77 were from EU countries (34% of total population and 
57% of Region 1), 21 from the United States, 29 from Japan, and 7 from Taiwan. 
In the BEAT-ROP study (Bevacizumab Eliminates the Angiogenic Threat of Retinopathy of Prematurity), 
67 % of the patients were Hispanic and for unknown reason ROP is reportedly more difficult to treat in 
these patients and may require more than one laser treatment (Stuart A, EyeNet Magazine, Feb 2014).   
Accordingly, the MAH was requested to address any potential ethnic differences applicable to anti-
VEGF treatment in ROP treatment and consider any implications for the risk management plan and 
product information. However, according to the MAH, only 10 patients of Hispanic ethnicity were 
enrolled in Study H2301. This sample size is too small for interpretation.

Extension Study 
Baseline demographics of patients in the Extension Study were comparable across treatment groups. 
Treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to baseline demographics also in the 
Extension Study. Absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at the last visit of Core 
Study = first visit of the Extension Study (i.e. 24 weeks after the first study treatment) was observed 
in 56/70 (80 %), 57/76 (75 %) and 45/68 (66.2 %) in ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 0.1 mg and laser groups, 
respectively. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint results 
Treatment success, the primary efficacy variable, was defined as the absence of active ROP and 
absence of unfavourable structural outcomes before or at 24 weeks. If a patient died or switched 
investigational treatment before or at 24 weeks, the patient was considered as a treatment failure 
(i.e., having active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks). 
The proportion of patients achieving treatment success was highest with ranibizumab 0.2 mg (80.0 
%), followed by ranibizumab 0.1 mg (75.0 %) and laser (66.2 %) (see table below).  
The odds of treatment success for ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared with laser were: OR=2.19 (95 % CI: 
0.9932, 4.8235. The one-sided p-value (p=0.0254) was marginally above the significance level of 
0.025.  
The treatment difference calculated using CMH weights stratified by baseline ROP zone was 14.7 % for 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared to laser and 9.3 % for ranibizumab 0.1 mg compared to laser [SCE 
Appendix 1-Table 2-11].  
As the primary comparison was marginally above the significance level of 0.025, the secondary 
comparisons (ranibizumab 0.1 mg vs. laser and ranibizumab 0.2 mg vs. 0.1 mg) were assessed 
descriptively. The odds ratios were numerically in favour of ranibizumab 0.1 mg compared with laser 
(OR=1.57; 95 % CI: 0.7604, 3.2587) and of ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared with ranibizumab 0.1 mg 
(OR=1.35; 0.95 % CI: 0.6101, 2.9810) [Study H2301-Table 14.2-1.9].

A pre-specified sensitivity analysis was performed with an alternative imputation rule, whereby results 
at the Week 20 visit were carried forward to fill in any missing outcomes of active ROP and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at Week 24 (imputation rule 2). This alternative imputation rule led 
to the outcome being changed for 1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group (status changed from 
missing to success). Results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary analysis (see 
table below).

Additional post hoc analyses showed that the proportion of patients with treatment success was 
consistently higher for ranibizumab 0.2 mg vs. laser when deaths were not counted as treatment 
failures (83.6 % for ranibizumab 0.2 mg vs. 69.2 % for laser; OR=2.34; 95 % CI: 1.0068, 5.449; 
p=0.0234).

Secondary efficacy analysis results 
Individual components of the primary efficacy variable indicating treatment failure 
The individual components of the primary efficacy variable at or before 24 weeks after the first study 
treatment are summarised in the table below. Overall, ranibizumab 0.2 mg showed numerically lower 
rates of unfavourable structural outcomes and treatment switching at or before Week 24 compared 
with the laser group; both of these groups had no patients with active ROP (i.e., vessel dilatation of 
plus disease in at least 2 quadrants or extra-retinal vessels extending from retina into the vitreous) at 
Week 24. 
Active ROP in either eye at or before Week 24 was reported only in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (3 
patients, 4.3 %). In all 3 cases, active ROP was due to vessel dilatation of plus disease in at least 2 
quadrants of the eye but not due to extra-retinal vessels extending from the retina into the vitreous 
[Study H2301-Table 14.2-5.1b]. 
Unfavourable structural outcomes (defined by the presence of any of the following features: retrolental 
membrane obscuring the view of the posterior pole, substantial temporal retinal vessel dragging 
causing abnormal structural features/macular ectopia, posterior retinal fold involving the macula, and 
retinal detachment involving the macula) in either eye at or before Week 24 were less frequently 
reported for ranibizumab 0.2 mg (1 patient, 1.4 %) compared with ranibizumab 0.1 mg (5 patients, 
6.7 %) and laser (7 patients, 10.1 %).  
An identical number of patients across the treatment groups (4 in each treatment group) died at or 
before the 24-week assessment. Deaths are further described in Section 5.2.2.1. 
A lower proportion of patients in both ranibizumab groups than in the laser group required intervention 
for ROP in either eye at or before Week 24 with a treatment modality different from the initial 
treatment modality (i.e., the proportion of patients who switched treatment): 14.9 % for ranibizumab 
0.2 mg and 16.9 % for ranibizumab 0.1 mg vs. 24.3 % for laser (see table below). Among the patients 
receiving ranibizumab 0.2 mg at baseline, fewer than 15 % required additional intervention with 
another treatment modality and only 1 patient had unfavourable structural outcomes at or before 
Week 24. In contrast, among the patients receiving laser treatment at baseline, nearly 1 in 4 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 44/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
required intervention with another treatment modality, and over 10 % patients had unfavourable 
structural outcomes at or before Week 24.

weeks after initial treatment (Study H2301, Full Analysis Set)

In a Kaplan–Meier estimate of time to death or to treatment switch or to the first occurrence of 
unfavourable structural outcomes in either eye up to 24 weeks, the event probability estimate, i.e. the 
estimated probability that a patient experienced an event prior to Week 24, was lower with 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg (19.6%) and ranibizumab 0.1 mg (23.7%) than with laser (33.4%) in the overall 
study population. 
Individual unfavourable structural outcomes in either eye at or before 24 weeks after the first study 
treatment are summarised in the table below. Overall, the number of patients with any unfavourable 
structural outcomes in either eye at or before 24 weeks after the first study treatment was low (< 5 
patients for any unfavourable structural outcome for each treatment group): 
Retrolental membrane obscuring the view of the posterior pole was not reported for any patient in any 
treatment group. The proportion of patients with substantial temporal retinal vessel dragging causing 
abnormal structural features/macular ectopia was numerically lower in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group 
(1 patient, 1.4%) than in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (3 patients, 4.0%) and the laser group (4 
patients, 5.8%). Posterior retinal fold involving the macula occurred only in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg (1 
patient, 1.4%) and laser (2 patients, 2.9%) groups. Retinal detachment involving the macula occurred 
only in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg (3 patients, 4.0%) and laser (3 patients, 4.3%) groups. 
Recurrence of ROP receiving any post-baseline intervention at 24 weeks or before 
Post-baseline interventions were allowed in cases of unsatisfactory response, as defined in [Study 
H2301-Section 9.4.6.4]. 
Post-baseline intervention in the ranibizumab groups included ranibizumab retreatment or switch to 
laser. A total of 23 (31.1 %) patients in ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and 24 (31.2 %) patients in 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group received post-baseline intervention at or before 24 weeks [SCE-Section 
3.2.3.2]. Of these patients receiving any post-baseline intervention, 16 (21.9 %) patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and 17 (22.4 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group received 
ranibizumab retreatment [SCS Appendix 1-Table 3-3]. 
In the laser group, switch to ranibizumab was considered as post-baseline intervention, whereas 
supplementary laser treatments (e.g., for skip lesions) were considered as part of the initial laser and 
not as post-baseline intervention if the supplemental laser was performed within 3 days after the Day 
8 assessment. A total of 14 (18.9 %) patients in the laser group received post- baseline intervention 
[Study H2301-Table 11-10], including 13 patients who received ranibizumab and 1 patient who 
received supplemental laser after the allowed window of 3 days after the Day 8 assessment [Study 
H2301-Listing 16.2.5-1.2].

structural outcome in either eye at or before 24 weeks after the first study treatment (Full 
Analysis Set) 
Additional post hoc analyses 
Other endpoints analysed post hoc included resolution of plus disease and resolution of proliferation 
(Stage 3 disease), as defined below: 
•  Resolution of plus disease (if either eye was assessed as mild plus, moderate plus or severe 
plus in ≥ 2 quadrants) was evaluated for patients with plus disease at baseline. 
Resolution was defined as the first observation of absence of plus disease. 
•  Resolution of proliferation (Stage 3) was evaluated for patients with ROP Stage 3 at baseline. 
Resolution of proliferation is reflected by disappearance of Stage 3 and disease improvement, 
including regression into milder ROP stages e.g. Stage 2, Stage 1 or No ROP, with ROP stage 
defined as the most severe stage in both eyes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 48/101 
 
 
 
 
For both resolution of plus disease and resolution of proliferation, patients who died or dropped 
out/completed the study without resolution were included for censoring. Moreover, recurrences of plus 
disease or recurrences of proliferation after the resolution were disregarded. 
Disease resolution – Resolution of plus disease 
The presence of plus disease is an indication of ROP severity and for determining the adequate 
moment of treatment. Time to resolution of plus disease was defined as the first observation of 
absence of plus disease.  
Resolution of plus disease in 25 % of patients occurred within 3 and 2 days with ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
and 0.1 mg, respectively (see Figure below), compared to 9 days with laser [SCE Appendix 1-Table 2-
8]. The time to 75 % of patients experiencing resolution of plus disease was also considerably shorter 
in both ranibizumab groups (8 days) compared with the laser group (22.5 days) [SCE Appendix 1-
Table 2-8].

disease at baseline (Study H2301, Full Analysis Set) 
Censored patients are those who completed/dropped out of the study without experiencing resolution of plus 
disease. 
Source: [SCE-Figure 3-2]. 
Time to resolution of proliferation 
As ROP is a vasoproliferative disorder of the retina, proliferation (stage 3) of ROP is associated with 
unfavourable structural sequelae as well as unfavourable functional outcomes. Hence, proliferation is 
another indicator of treatment need. Resolution of proliferation is reflected by disappearance of Stage 
3 and disease improvement, including regression into milder ROP stages e.g. Stage 2, Stage 1 or No 
ROP, with ROP stage defined as the most severe stage in both eyes.  
The resolution of proliferation started earlier for the ranibizumab groups compared with the laser 
group, with a separation between ranibizumab 0.2 mg and laser apparent within the first week after 
initial treatment (see Figure below). Resolution of proliferation in 25 % of patients occurred within 5 
days with either ranibizumab 0.2 mg or 0.1 mg compared to 15 days with laser [SCE Appendix 1-Table 
2-9]. The time to 75 % of patients experiencing resolution of proliferation was also shorter in both 
ranibizumab groups (23 and 21 days for ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg, respectively) compared with 
the laser group (43 days) [SCE Appendix 1-Table 2-9].

proliferation. 
Source: [SCE-Figure 3-3]. 
Analyses indicate that both treatments were efficacious but there was a faster resolution of plus disease 
and resolution of proliferation for ranibizumab 0.2 mg than for laser therapy.  
On the other hand, as noted previously, the proportion of patients with recurrence of ROP was higher in 
both ranibizumab groups than in the laser group (31.1 % and 31.2 % vs. 18.9 %). 
A  maximum  of  3  ranibizumab  injections  in  each  eye  were  allowed  in  the  studies,  but  28  subjects 
appeared to have received 4–6 injections. In response to the RSI, this was appropriately explained by 
the MAH; in Study H2301, as per protocol, each eye could receive up to a maximum of three injections: 
the initial treatment plus up to two retreatments. Therefore, a patient could have received a maximum 
of six injections, i.e. three injections per eye. The patients receiving four-six injection for both eyes were 
allowed per protocol. 
The  vast  majority  of  patients  in  the  ranibizumab  groups  received  two  injections  per  patient,  or  one 
injection per eye), see table below.

Subgroup  analyses  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  AEs  was  performed  for  patients  in  the 
ranibizumab groups receiving only baseline ranibizumab treatment or ranibizumab retreatment.  
Overall,  treatment  success  was  consistent  in  the  ranibizumab-treated  patients,  regardless  whether 
patients received only baseline injection or were retreated (Table 18-1).  
Ancillary analyses 
The primary efficacy variable was analysed for the following subgroup variables: 
−  Gender (male, female) 
−  Gestational age (≤ 24 weeks, > 24 - < 27 weeks, ≥ 27 weeks) 
−  Birth weight (≤ 750 g, > 750 - < 1000 g, ≥ 1000 g) 
−  Geographical region (Region 1 and Region 2, as defined by the IRT) 
−  Baseline ROP zone (Zone I, Zone II; from CRF) 
−  AP-ROP status (AP-ROP, non AP-ROP) 
Demographic and background factors 
The patterns of treatment success in the different subgroups of demographic factors were broadly 
consistent with those observed for the overall population, although numerical variation was observed 
in some subgroups, particular those treated with laser. 
−  By gender, treatment success was achieved by 84.8 % of males and 75.7 % of females at 
Week 24 after initial treatment with ranibizumab 0.2 mg [Study H2301-Table 14.2-2.5]. The 
corresponding rates for the laser group were 54.3 % and 78.8 %, respectively. 
−  By gestational age, the proportion of patients with treatment success at Week 24 after the 
initial ranibizumab 0.2 mg treatment was 75.9 % for ≤ 24 weeks, 88.9 % for >24 weeks-≤ 27 
weeks, and 78.3 % for ≥ 27 weeks [Study H2301-Table 14.2-2.4]. The corresponding rates for 
the laser group showed a wide variation: 44.4 %, 60.0 % and 92.3 %, respectively. 
−  By birth weight, the proportion of patients with treatment success at Week 24 after the initial 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg treatment was 80.6 % for ≤ 750 g, 73.3 % for >750-<1000 g, and 81.3 
% for ≥1000 g [Study H2301-Table 14.2-2.2]. The corresponding rates for the laser group 
showed a wider variation: 51.4 %, 72.7 % and 86.7 %, respectively. 
−  By geographic region, treatment success was reported for 85.7 % of patients in Region 1 and 
71.4 % of patients in Region 2 at Week 24 after initial ranibizumab 0.2 mg treatment [Study 
H2301-Table 14.2-2.7]. The corresponding rates for the laser group were 61.9 % and 73.1 %, 
respectively. 
When the results of the study were analysed by birth weight and gestational age, ranibizumab 
treatments seemed to be more effective than laser therapy in the smallest infants groups (≤750 g, ≤
24 weeks); laser therapy reported better response than ranibizumab in the oldest ones (≥ 27 weeks) 
and in those weighing more than 1000 g. According to the MAH, differences observed between groups 
by gestational age and weight are likely due to chance rather than real differences. However, the 
possibility that more severely preterm infants may respond better to ranibizumab and that less 
severely preterm infants may respond better to laser cannot be totally excluded. 
Disease factors 
The patterns of treatment success in the different subgroups of baseline disease factors were broadly 
consistent with those observed for the overall population, although numerical variation was observed 
in some subgroups, particular those treated with laser. 
−  By baseline ROP status, the proportion of patients with treatment success at Week 24 after the 
initial ranibizumab 0.2 mg treatment was 67.9 % for ROP Zone I and 88.1 % for ROP Zone II 
[Study H2301-Table 14.2-2.9]. The corresponding rates for the laser group were 60.9 % and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 51/101 
 
 
 
 
68.9 %, respectively. 
−  By AP-ROP status, treatment success was reported in 86.7 % of patients with non AP-ROP at 
Week 24 after initial treatment with ranibizumab 0.2 mg. The corresponding rate for the laser-
treated patients with non AP-ROP was 66.7 % [Study H2301-Table 14.2-2.12]. The number of 
AP-ROP patients was very small (8-10 per treatment group) and does not allow for a definitive 
subgroup analysis. 
The study is part of the clinical development programme and was carried out according to the 
Paediatric Investigation Plan of Lucentis.  
An 80.0 % treatment success was observed in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, compared with 75.0 % 
in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 66.2 % in the laser group. However, the one-sided p-value 
0.0254 for the primary endpoint was above the significance level of 0.025. The finding may be argued 
to be clinically relevant as, compared with laser therapy, the patients treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
were 2 times more likely to achieve treatment success.  
The findings of higher treatment success were further supported by sensitivity analyses. First, the 
imputed value of the missing ocular criterion at Week 24 was derived from the value at Week 20. This 
affected 3 patients, 2 patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group (1 patient who was imputed from 
missing to success and 1 patient who remained failure due to death) and 1 patient in the laser group 
(who remained failure due to switch). In this sensitivity analysis, treatment success was higher in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg group compared with the laser group (80.3 % vs. 66.2 %; OR 2.22, 95 % CI 
[1.0088, 4.8890]), and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.0230). Second, also other 
sensitivity analyses (with missing data not imputed, missing data imputed as ‘success’, missing data 
imputed as ‘failure’, and using sensitivity logistic regression) confirmed the results of the primary 
analysis, with the highest treatment success observed in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, followed by 
the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser groups. 
Among patients receiving ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 14.9 % needed additional intervention with another 
treatment modality and only 1 patient (1.4 %) had unfavourable structural outcomes at or before 
Week 24. Among the patients receiving laser treatment at Baseline, 24.3 % required intervention with 
another treatment modality and 7 patients (10.1 %) had unfavourable structural outcomes. 
On the other hand, the proportion of patients with recurrence of ROP, as defined as any post-baseline 
study intervention up to 24 weeks after initial treatment (i.e. ranibizumab re-treatment or switch to 
laser in the ranibizumab groups, switch to ranibizumab treatment in the laser group), was higher in 
both ranibizumab groups than in the laser group (31.1 % and 31.2 % vs. 18.9 %). 
When the response was analysed by Zones, patients with ROP Zone II (regardless if they were treated 
with ranibizumab or laser therapy) globally showed a higher effect than that observed in patients with 
ROP Zone I. Ranibizumab (both doses) showed a higher rate of success than laser therapy both in 
Zone I and Zone II, but differences between treatment in patients with posterior Zone I ROP can be 
considered marginal (ranibizumab 0.2 mg 67.9% vs ranibizumab 0.1 mg 70% vs laser therapy 
60.9%). This is rather unexpected since it has been suggested in the literature (Zhang G et al. Retina 
2017; 37:710–717; VanderVeen DK et al. Ophthalmology 2017;124:619-633) that ranibizumab (as 
anti-VEGF agent) is more effective in Zone I ROP while laser therapy would be a preferable option in 
Zone II ROP. The MAH was requested to further discuss this issue. Overall, it appears that more 
research is needed before any specific guidance can be established in this respect. 
By regions, relevant differences in response were observed between Region 1 and Region 2. 
Ranibizumab (0.2 mg and 0.1 mg) achieved a high response (>80%), significantly superior to laser 
therapy (61.9%) in Region 1. In Region 2, 73.1% of infants treated with laser therapy (vs 71.4% on 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 64.5% on ranibizumab 0.1 mg) reached treatment success. It is uncertain 
Assessment report

Page 52/101 
 
 
 
whether these differences between regions are related with baseline characteristics of the premature 
infants, ROP severity, level of standard care in neonatal intensive units or training in neonatal and 
ophthalmologic care for premature infants. The MAH was requested to justify the extrapolability of the 
global study results to the EU population.  
In response to the RSI, the MAH performed additional analyses for treatment success of EU and non-
EU patients (see Table 19-1 below). Treatment success in the EU was reported in 80.0% (24/30) of 
patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 83.3% (25/30) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 63.3% 
(19/30) in the laser group, corresponding to an odds ratio of 2.33 (95% CI: 0.7295, 7.4661) in favour 
of ranibizumab 0.2 mg vs. laser. Therefore, the MAH considers the results of the Study H2301 
population as being applicable and clinically meaningful to the European population.

having active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at Week 24. CMH test was used with ROP Zone at Baseline (I and II) as stratum factor. a Odds 
ratio is calculated by using CMH test ROP zone information is obtained from CRF. Source: [Appendix 5-Table AR-E3.1] 
Nevertheless, differences in response were observed between both Regions. Whereas ranibizumab 
showed significantly superior response (>80%) than laser therapy (61.9%) in Region 1, laser therapy 
showed higher treatment success than ranibizumab in Region 2 (73.1% vs 71.4% ranibizumab 0.2mg 
and 64.5% ranibizumab 0.1 mg).  
It is uncertain whether the observed regional differences could be related to e.g. differences in 
baseline characteristics of the premature infants, ROP severity, level of standard care in neonatal 
intensive units or training in neonatal and ophthalmologic care for premature infants. Accordingly, the 
MAH was requested to provide an additional analysis of the primary endpoint components according 
the two pre-specified geographical regions. No relevant differences were observed in the response 
between regions except for the number of deaths: 4 in Region 1 (3.0%) and 8 in Region 2 (8.8%). 
While this could be related to patients’ characteristics or the level of neonatal care in the corresponding 
countries it does not seem to be linked to ranibizumab treatment.  
Overall, these findings may indicate clinical benefit for ranibizumab in the treatment of retinopathy of 
prematurity. Although the unfavourable structural changes in ROP are key predictors of the vision, and

ranibizumab has demonstrated treatment success, only long-term follow-up will confirm the final 
outcome of the study treatments regarding visual acuity and structural changes such as retinal 
detachment.  
In this regard, the results of the IA2 and the final report for H2301E1 could be considered as being 
important for the benefit-risk assessment of ranibizumab in this new indication. 
RAINBOW Extension interim data 
The RAINBOW Extension Study (H2301E1) is an ongoing open-label Extension Study of the long-term 
efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab compared with laser ablation therapy in patients with 
ROP who successfully completed the RAINBOW Core Study. 
Ranibizumab treatment was permitted for eligible eyes up to and including the Week 40 visit (Epoch 
1), corresponding to 40 weeks after a patient received the first study treatment in the Core Study. 
Treatment with ranibizumab was permitted either as re-treatment for patients, who had received 
ranibizumab as the last treatment prior to joining the Extension Study, or as switch treatment for 
patients, who only received laser therapy in the Core Study and required additional treatment in the 
Extension Study. 
Patients who required switch treatment in the Extension Study were administered ranibizumab 0.2 mg. 
A maximum of 3 ranibizumab injections in each eye were allowed during the combined time period of 
the Core Study plus Epoch 1 of the Extension Study. The remainder of the Extension Study (Epoch 2) 
is observational. 
All analyses were carried out on the Extension Safety Set. The Extension Safety Set is defined as the 
subset of the patients from the Safety Set of the Core Study who entered the Extension Study.  
At the time of the data cut-off date of 31 December 2017 for the interim analysis IA1, data on 
structural abnormalities and AEs reported for the IA1 dataset were available in a total of 144 patients 
(50, 51 and 43 in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 0.1 mg and laser groups, respectively). Of these 144 
patients, 143 had completed the Week 40 visit and 1 patient who had received laser treatment in 
Study H2301 died prior to Week 40.  
The amended protocol of the Extension Study 2014-004048-36 (PIP number: 000527-PIP04-13) 
version v01 introduced measures to explore visual acuity at the child’s 2 and 3 years’ corrected age 
(Cardiff Acuity test), the refraction in each eye at the child’s 3 years’ corrected age (diopters) and 
visual function as per the responses collected on the vision function form (qualitative assessment) to 
capture visual function and peripheral vision at a supplemental visit at the patient’s fifth birthday.  
In the first RSI the Applicant was requested to present and discuss all available results on functional 
testing of vision. In response to this request, the MAH has included an additional, supplementary IA 
(supp-IA) that contains available results of vision function outcomes and safety from the ongoing 
H2301E1 study. This supp-IA has been conducted using a cut-off date of 06-Feb-2019 and it was 
explained that the next (predefined) interim analysis (IA2) is planned after the last patient has 
completed the visit at the corrected age of two years. The results are planned to be available in Q4 
2019. 
Data reported in the supp-IA contain the visual reception of Mullen scale of early learning (104 patients 
in total), CAT at two years of corrected age (26 patients), vision function rating (VA and peripheral 
vision) at the supplementary visit (21 and 29 patients, respectively) and safety data (including the 
growth parameters body weight, body height and head circumference at two years). The results are 
summarised further below (supp-IA data).

Results 
Absence of ocular structural abnormalities 
Table 20 below summarises the absence of all ocular structural abnormalities and individual 
components of ocular structural abnormalities at or before the Week 40 visit in the Extension Safety 
Set. 
Overall, absence of ocular structural abnormalities observed at Week 40 was high in both ranibizumab 
groups: 49/50 patients (98.0 %) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and 50/51 patients (98.0 %) in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group; for both ranibizumab groups numerically higher compared with the laser 
group (38/43 patients [88.4 %]). 
Substantial temporal retinal vessel dragging causing abnormal structural features or macular ectopia 
was reported in 1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and in 4 patients in the laser group. 
Posterior retinal fold was reported in 1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and in 1 patient in the 
laser group. Retinal detachment involving the macula was reported in 1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 
mg group and in 1 patient in the laser group. Retrolental membrane obscuring the view of the 
posterior pole was not reported for any patient in any treatment group. 
Absence of ROP 
All patients in the IA1 analysis showed absence of active ROP at 40 weeks post baseline visit. 
Recurrence of ROP 
Recurrence of ROP, defined as patients receiving any post-baseline intervention up to the Week 40 
visit in the IA1 Extension Safety Set, was reported in 13/50 (26.0 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg group, in 18/51 (35.3 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and in 8/43 (18.6 %) patients 
in the laser group (Table ia1-e1.3). Recurrence of ROP up to 24 weeks was reported for the Core Study 
in 23 patients (31.1 %) for ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 24 patients (31.2 %) for ranibizumab 0.1 mg and for 
14 patients (18.9 %) in the laser group. 
Extent of exposure 
The number of ranibizumab injections received by eye and by patient up to the Week 40 visit for the 
Extension Safety Set is presented in the table below. On average, patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
and 0.1 mg groups received 2.3 and 2.6 ranibizumab injections, respectively. There were 8 patients 
who received ranibizumab injections in the laser group; on average, these patients received 2.4 
ranibizumab injections. Overall, in the 3 treatment groups (including those who took at least one 
ranibizumab treatment in the laser group), the majority of patients received 2 ranibizumab injections. 
During Epoch 1, of the 144 patients, only one patient  received ranibizumab 0.1 mg re-treatment in 
both eyes at the Extension baseline visit. No other patient received study treatment in the Extension 
Study. 
Overall, absence of ocular structural abnormalities in the IA1 patients up to the Week 40 visit was high 
in all treatment groups: 49/50 patients (98.0 %) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 50/51 patients 
(98.0 %) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 38/43 patients (88.4 %) in the laser group. – Active 
ROP was not reported in any patient at the Week 40 visit. 
Recurrence of ROP up to the Week 40 visit was reported in 13/50 (26.0 %) patients in the ranibizumab 
0.2 mg group, 18/51 (35.3 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and in 8/43 (18.6 %) 
patients in the laser group. A similar trend was observed in the Core Study. The higher recurrence rate 
in the ranibizumab groups may be explained by the fact that laser photocoagulation therapy is known 
to destruct peripheral tissue responsible for continuous elevation of VEGF.

Table 17.  Absence of all ocular structural abnormalities and individual components of

Set 
structural abnormalities at or before 40 weeks post baseline. Extension Safety 
The absence of ocular structural abnormalities at Week 40 was high in both ranibizumab groups, and 
higher in both compared with the laser group. Active ROP was not reported in any patient at 40 weeks 
post baseline visit. 
The proportion of IA1 patients who received post-baseline intervention was 26.0 % in the ranibizumab 
0.2 mg group, 35.3 % in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 18.6 % in the laser group, comparable to 
those reported at Week 24 in the Core Study (31.1 %, 31.2 % and 18.9 %, respectively. = 31/101 
(30,7 %) vs. 8/43 (18.6 %), a difference of 165%. 
As an explanation, the Applicant hypothesises that laser photocoagulation, albeit unable to inhibit 
existing excessive VEGF and therefore having a slower onset, may minimise the risk of ROP recurrence 
at the cost of an increased risk for less favourable structural and visual outcomes. The hypothesis 
could be considered plausible, but the claimed increased risk for less favourable structural and visual 
outcomes in laser therapy in comparison with ranibizumab needs to be substantiated, most likely by 
long-term follow up. 
The Applicant was requested to further discuss the observed difference between ranibizumab and laser 
groups in post-baseline interventions. It was clarified that supplementary laser treatments were also 
allowed; as stated in the protocol (v02) and CSR, multiple supplementary laser treatments were 
allowed for both eyes until 3 days after the Day 8 assessment and such treatments were considered 
part of the complete laser treatment. Overall, 11 patients (14.9%) in the laser group received this 
supplementary laser treatment within the allotted time window. Accordingly, it can be agreed that the 
three treatment groups were similar within the referred to time period (up to Week 24).  
Ranibizumab treatment was permitted for eligible eyes up to and including the Week 40 visit (Epoch 
1), corresponding to 40 weeks after a patient received the first study treatment in the Core Study. A 
Assessment report

maximum of 3 ranibizumab injections in each eye were allowed during the combined time period of the 
Core Study plus Epoch 1 of the Extension Study.  
The data for this study is not yet complete; at the time of the data cut-off for the first interim analysis, 
144 patients had either completed Week 40 visit (143 patients) or had been discontinued in the 
extension study H2301E1 prior to Week 40 visit. On the other hand, only 1 of these 144 patients 
received ranibizumab re-treatment Up to Week 40 of the extension study.  
Overall, the completion of the extension study will provide a more complete picture. 
Assessment of clinical impact of syringe variation in RAINBOW study 
The MAH submitted a supplementary study report to the H2301 CSR: Assessment of clinical impact of 
syringe variation in RAINBOW study (07 May 2018). 
This supplementary report presents the results of sensitivity analyses performed to investigate the 
potential impact of an observed syringe variation on the clinical outcomes in patients randomised to 
ranibizumab treatment in the RAINBOW study. 
Prior to initiation of the RAINBOW study (first patient first visit: 30-Dec-2015), the MAH specified the 
use of the Becton Dickinson (BD) Plastipak 1 ml syringe for accurate delivery of intravitreal injection of 
target doses of 0.2 mg (20 μl) and 0.1 mg (10 μl) ranibizumab solutions. 
As a consequence of this observed variation, and despite the absence of evidence at the time of 
investigation that any of the evaluated syringe lots were used in the RAINBOW study, the MAH notified 
all Health Authorities in countries where the RAINBOW study was being conducted (in October 2017) 
concerning the potential variance in the technical performance of the specified BD Plastipak 1 ml 
syringe and committed to further investigate the performance of the syringes used in the study and 
the potential impact on clinical outcomes. 
For the RAINBOW study, Novartis Drug Supply Management (DSM) supplied ‘BD Plastipak 1 ml syringe’ 
(ref. 300013/303172) from two lots to the clinical sites where the specified syringe was not locally 
available. In countries where the specified BD Plastipak 1 ml syringe was available, the Novartis 
Country Pharma Organizations (CPO) or clinical sites sourced the syringes locally. 
Of the 26 countries in which patients were enrolled, 9 countries (Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, 
Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the United States) exclusively received specified BD 
Plastipak 1 ml syringes provided by Novartis DSM (global supply), from 2 batches manufactured in 
2013 and 2014 (lots 1309009 and 1407037). In one clinical site in the US, a non-specified 1 ml 
syringe was used for 1 patient in addition to the globally supplied syringes. In 15 countries (Austria, 
Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Italy, Lithuania, 
Poland, Turkey and the United Kingdom), the majority of sites used locally sourced, off-the-shelf, 
specified BD Plastipak 1 ml syringes from different lots, while some sites also used non-specified 1 ml 
syringes to perform intravitreal injections of the study drug. In 2 countries (Denmark and Slovakia) no 
patients received any ranibizumab intravitreal injections. 
The MAH conducted sensitivity analyses performed to investigate the potential impact of the observed 
syringe variation on the primary efficacy/pharmacokinetic (PK)/vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)/immunogenicity (anti-ranibizumab antibodies) variables, as well as on safety outcomes in the 
RAINBOW study. In general, patient baseline ROP characteristics were comparable across both 
ranibizumab treatment groups for both subgroup analyses: global vs. local supply (73 patients vs. 78 
patients) and specified BD Plastipak 1 ml vs. non-specified syringes (127 patients vs. 24 patients) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 57/101 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy and PK variables were analyzed along with the systemic VEGF and anti-ranibizumab antibody 
levels for the global vs. local supply, and the specified BD Plastipak 1 ml vs. non-specified syringes 
subgroups. The primary efficacy, PK, VEGF and immunogenicity results observed in the ‘global vs. local 
supply’ and the ‘specified BD Plastipak 1ml vs. non-specified syringes’ subgroups were consistent with 
those of the overall population. Differences observed in the subgroups due to smaller sample size in 
certain subgroups need to be interpreted with caution. 
The incidence of deaths, ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs were generally comparable across both 
the global vs. local supply and specified BD Plastipak 1 ml vs. non-specified syringes subgroups and 
consistent with the overall safety results reported in the study. 
The MAH intends to provide the low-volume high-accuracy syringe and an injection needle in a 
standalone device kit (VISISURE), to be used in combination with Lucentis 10 mg/ml solution for 
injection in vial in the European Union. 
No meaningful differences were observed. However, the respective subgroups were of modest size. 
Considering in vitro dose accuracy results for syringe lots used in paediatric clinical investigations 
provided by the MAH, it appears as if the doses administered using the 1-ml Plastipak™ syringe from 
Becton Dickinson in the RAINBOW study were higher than the target doses 10 and 20 microliter. The 
low-volume high-accuracy syringe intended for clinical use is likely to deliver a dose closer to the 
target dose.  
Accordingly, the Applicant was asked to discuss whether this could have an impact on the efficacy of 
the treatment. It can be agreed with the Applicant that the impact on efficacy by the small volume 
difference from the low-volume high-accuracy syringe, if any, will be not be of clinical relevance. 
Regarding the low-volume high-accuracy syringe in the standalone device kit proposed by the MAH, it 
should be noted that adults and preterm infants represent very different target populations with 
different needs (the number of candidates and the frequency of treatment is much higher in the adult 
than in the preterm population). In addition, the use of the commercially available vial for preterm 
infants implies discarding a relevant part of the total volume of the product. Finally, the product 
information for this indication/population will partially differ from the currently approved one. With this 
in mind, the development of a specific pre-filled low-volume syringe would have been the preferred 
option to minimise medication errors. This would allow providing the suitable dose/volume of 0.02 ml 
with its own product information (specific to the preterm infants).  The current proposal is acceptable, 
however. 
Long-term vision outcomes from supp-IA (cut-off 06-Feb-2019, submitted in Applicant’s 
response to RSI) 
The results of visual reception Mullen sub-scale, CAT and vision function assessment are summarized 
in the table below.

Table 18. Supplementary Interim Analysis data on vision function – Study H2301E1 
Visual reception was assessed using the corresponding Mullen sub-scale at the corrected age of two 
years in Study H2301E1 and is presented as T score. The T score is an age-calibrated and standardized 
rating of the subscales of Mullen scale of early learning. Results of the visual reception subscale of the 
Mullen scale at two years corrected age have shown a mean T score of 37.2 to 39.3, which was well-
distributed across the ranibizumab and laser treatment groups. The visual reception subscale scores 
were overall numerically similar across the treatment groups, indicating that there were no detrimental 
effects with ranibizumab treatment compared to laser therapy. The observed distribution of the T-
score was towards the lower end of the cognitive scale and consistent to what is reported in a 
premature, low weight population (Grunau et al 2004, Harel-Gadassi et al 2018; Sommerfelt et al 
1996; Vohr et al 1989). 
Results of binocular CAT performed at Year 2 are presented in LogMar, the bigger the LogMAR score 
the poorer the visual acuity. The mean value in Snellen equivalent is also presented for comparison. 
The average LogMAR VA score (range) of 0.37 (0.1-0.7), 0.40 (0.0-1.1), 0.63 (0.4-0.9) in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 0.1 mg and laser treatment groups, respectively, suggest a numerically better 
vision in the ranibizumab groups than in the laser group. Therefore, despite the small sample size, 
there is no indication of deteriorating effects of ranibizumab on vision. 
In addition, three patients have completed the Year 3 visit and CAT results at the Year 3 visit are 
available, one in each treatment group. The LogMAR score was 0.0, 0.1 and 0.1 for the patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 0.1 mg and laser groups, respectively. 
Vision function outcome was assessed for VA and peripheral vision based on the routine assessments 
performed by the investigator in clinical practice, and results are summarized for the binocular vision 
function rating in the table above. Although it has been acknowledged that there is a lack of 
established vision function tests which are suitable for this age (when such assessments are performed 
in clinical practice, the assessments are reported in [Appendix 5-Listing ias–e1.2] for VA, and 
[Appendix 5-Listing ias-e1.1] for peripheral vision), results from vision function assessments which

were obtained for a few patients at the supplementary visit did not reveal any detrimental signal with 
ranibizumab treatment. 
In summary, no detrimental effects in vision function with ranibizumab treatment were identified from 
the long-term data up to three years of age.

3.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking a new indication for Lucentis (ranibizumab) in preterm infants for the treatment of 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The recommended dose is 0.2 mg given as a single intravitreal 
injection which can be given bilaterally on the same day. Further treatment may be administered if 
there are signs of disease activity. 
The MAH submitted a randomised, multicenter, open-label, 3-arm, parallel-group, superiority study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg, intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
and laser therapy for the treatment of ROP. A total of 225 preterm infants (mean gestational age 26.1 
weeks) with ROP were randomised of which 218 received investigational treatment. Patients should 
have bilateral ROP with 1 of the following retinal findings in each eye: Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ 
disease, or Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or AP-ROP. Treatment success, the primary efficacy variable, 
was defined as the absence of active ROP and absence of unfavourable structural outcomes before or 
at 24 weeks. A 3-step sequential testing procedure was used for primary (ranibizumab 0.2 mg against 
laser) and 2 key secondary comparisons (ranibizumab 0.1 mg against laser and ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
against 0.1 mg). 
The diagnosis and follow-up of the patients was made by using images taken by RetCam digital 
photography and/or indirect ophthalmoscopy. It was questioned whether differences in the method 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 62/101 
 
 
 
used for the selection may have resulted in relevant differences in the final population recruited 
(according to severity, gestational age, or demographic characteristics) and/or a notable difference in 
outcome between the two methods. The MAH was requested to provide the number and characteristics 
of the patients separately, in accordance with the method used and clarify to what degree patients 
were evaluated with one or both methods and whether there was a notable difference in outcome 
between the 2 methods for evaluation. However, in response, the MAH explained that most of the 
infants included were evaluated by either of the two methods (interchangeably) so that a separate 
analysis by method would not be informative. 
In the Core Study, 80.0% treatment success was observed in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 
compared with 75.0% in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 66.2% in the laser group. Statistical 
significance for superiority was not achieved for 0.2 mg ranibizumab compared with laser ablation 
therapy (OR: 2.19, CI: 0.9932, 4.8235). Since the efficacy comparison of the first step was not 
statistically significant (p=0.0254), the remaining efficacy comparisons were assessed descriptively. In 
the study, a non-inferiority test was not planned, and a non-inferiority margin was therefore not 
defined. Defining a non-inferiority margin post hoc is difficult as the choice may be suspected to 
depend on the outcome of the study (CPMP/EWP/482/99). However, with the achieved confidence 
interval (0.9932, 4.8235), it appears from the data that ranibizumab is at least as efficient as laser 
therapy with regard to the primary endpoint. The findings were further supported by the conducted 
sensitivity analyses.  
During the follow-up period rescue therapy was permitted. In case of unsatisfactory response infants 
could be retreated with the assigned treatment or switched to another treatment (patients who 
received ranibizumab as initial treatment could switch to laser therapy and vice versa). The MAH was 
requested to clarify when unresponsive patients received retreatment with the same modality and 
when they were switched to another treatment modality and how standardization of this process was 
assured. In response to the RSI, the MAH explained that infants were retreated with the baseline 
treatment or switched over to a different treatment modality based on investigator’s decision. No pre-
defined criteria were established. Accordingly, no specific recommendations can be included in the 
SmPC. However, the MAH has updated the wording for section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to limit the 
administration of ranibizumab up to three injections, which is acceptable.  
Among patients receiving ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 14.9 % needed additional intervention with another 
treatment modality and only 1 patient (1.4 %) had unfavourable structural outcomes at or before 
Week 24. On the other hand, among the patients receiving laser treatment at Baseline 24.3 % 
required intervention with another treatment modality and 7 patients (10.1 %) had unfavourable 
structural outcomes. Should these results translate to favourable findings for visual functioning, then 
they could be argued to be clinically relevant. However, this is currently not fully known. 
The first interim analysis on the Extension Study provided additional data on the need for re-
treatment, structural changes in the eye fundus and important safety data. Overall, the absence of 
ocular structural abnormalities observed at Week 40 was high in both ranibizumab groups, and higher 
than in the laser group. Importantly, all patients in the IA1 analysis showed absence of active ROP at 
40 weeks post baseline visit.  
Ranibizumab treatment was permitted for eligible eyes up to and including the Week 40 visit (Epoch 
1), corresponding to 40 weeks after a patient received the first study treatment in the Core Study. 
A maximum of 3 ranibizumab injections in each eye were allowed during the combined time period of 
the Core Study plus Epoch 1 of the Extension Study. The data for this study is not yet complete; at the 
time of the data cut-off for the first interim analysis, 144 patients had either completed Week 40 visit 
(143 patients) or had been discontinued in the extension study H2301E1 prior to Week 40 visit. On the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 63/101 
 
 
 
other hand, only 1 of these 144 patients received ranibizumab re-treatment Up to Week 40 of the 
extension study.  
The need for repeated injections in this population would be a potential concern from a safety 
perspective, in terms of repeated exposure to ranibizumab and the increased risk for ocular infections. 
However, 75% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group received no more than 2 injections in total 
(one per eye) and none of the patients in this dose group required re-treatment beyond Week 24.  
The majority of subjects were Caucasian (59%) followed by Asian (32%) and African American 
subjects (3.1%). Overall, 60% of patients were recruited in Region 1 and 40% in Region 2.  The wide 
geographical distribution of patients determines the recruitment of patients with heterogeneous 
baseline characteristics (including birth weight, gestational age), and different standard of care 
(including screening of the condition, methods of diagnosis, management of the patients in the 
Neonatal Intensive Care Units). 
Analysed by region, relevant differences in response were observed between Region 1 and Region 2. 
Ranibizumab (0.2 mg and 0.1 mg) achieved a high response (>80%), significantly superior to laser 
therapy (61.9%) in Region 1. In Region 2, 73.1% of infants treated with laser therapy (vs 71.4% on 
ranibizumab 0.2mg and 64.5% on ranibizumab 0.1 mg) reached treatment success. It was questioned 
whether these differences between regions could be explained by baseline characteristics of the 
premature infants, ROP severity, level of standard care in neonatal intensive units or training in 
neonatal and ophthalmologic care for premature infants. Accordingly, the MAH was requested to 
provide an additional analysis of the primary endpoint components according the two pre-specified 
geographical regions. No relevant differences were observed in the response between regions except 
for the number of deaths: 4 in Region 1 (3.0%) and 8 in Region 2 (8.8%). While this could be related 
to patients’ characteristics or the level of neonatal care in the corresponding countries it does not seem 
to be linked to ranibizumab treatment.  
When the response was analysed by Zones, patients with ROP Zone II (regardless they were treated 
with ranibizumab or laser therapy) globally showed a higher effect than that observed in patients with 
ROP Zone I. Ranibizumab (both doses) showed higher rate of success than laser therapy both in Zone 
I and Zone II, but differences between treatments in patients with Zone I ROP can be considered 
marginal (ranibizumab 0.2 mg 67.9% vs ranibizumab 0.1 mg 70% vs laser therapy 60.9%). This is 
rather unexpected since it has been suggested in the literature (Zhang G et al. Retina 2017; 37:710–
717; VanderVeen DK et al. Ophthalmology 2017;124:619-633) that ranibizumab (as anti-VEGF agent) 
is more effective in Zone I ROP while laser therapy would be a preferable option in Zone II ROP. The 
MAH was requested to further discuss this issue. Overall, it appears that more research is needed 
before any specific guidance can be established in this respect. 
Functional testing is described in the amended protocol submitted with the current application. 
However, no data on visual acuity or visual fields has yet been provided. The amended protocol 
introduces measures to explore visual acuity at the child’s 2 and 3 years’ corrected age (Cardiff Acuity 
test) and 5 years (ETDRS visual acuity test), refraction in each eye and visual function as per the 
responses collected on a vision function form (qualitative assessment) at a supplemental visit to 
capture visual function, and peripheral vision at the patient’s fifth birthday.  
In response to the initial RSI, the MAH has already included an additional, supplementary IA (supp-IA) 
that contains available results of vision function outcomes and safety from the ongoing H2301E1 
study. This supp-IA has been conducted using a cut-off date of 06-Feb-2019. 
Data reported in the supp-IA contain the visual reception of Mullen scale of early learning, an 
instrument to examine cognitive development (104 patients in total), CAT at two years of corrected 
age (26 patients), vision function rating (VA and peripheral vision) at the supplementary visit (21 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 64/101 
 
 
 
29 patients, respectively) and safety data (including the growth parameters body weight, body height 
and head circumference at two years). 
No detrimental effects in vision function with ranibizumab treatment were identified in these 
preliminary, partial data. No differences were apparent between patients treated with ranibizumab 
(either 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg) and laser therapy. This assessment of visual acuity is, however, based on 
very few patients and not considered sufficient to conclude on the long-term benefit of ranibizumab; 
however, they do not raise further concerns at this time.  
The documentation of efficacy is compromised by a low number of subjects and the relatively short 
follow-up time. Lack of data on visual acuity and visual fields is considered a major weakness, as the 
eyes will still continue to develop for several years. Whatever data will become available from the 
Extension Study during the review period still involves significant uncertainties regarding the long-term 
outcome. 
In line with this concern, a recent Cochrane review concluded that ‘intravitreal 
bevacizumab/ranibizumab, when used as monotherapy, reduces the risk of refractive errors during 
childhood, but does not reduce the risk of retinal detachment or recurrence of ROP in infants with type 
1 ROP. While the intervention might reduce the risk of recurrence of ROP in infants with zone I ROP, it 
can potentially result in higher risk of recurrence requiring retreatment in those with zone II ROP.  
However, in the current study, late recurrence beyond 40 weeks after initial treatment was not 
observed, and the majority of patients received only one injection per eye. 
Overall, the current data available are still insufficient to conclude on long-term visual outcome.  In 
addition, it has been noted that the study protocol does not require the visual function assessor to be 
blinded to the assigned treatment allocation. To reduce bias, a protocol amendment should be 
implemented to require this to be the case, at the 5th year of age visual acuity assessment. In 
response to the second RSI, the MAH has agreed to implement a new protocol amendment that 
contains the requirement of a masked VA assessor for the visual acuity assessment at 5 years of age, 
which is the primary endpoint of the Study H2301E1. 
The initially proposed indication (treatment of ROP in premature infants) was broader compared with 
the study population, which included patients with bilateral ROP with one of the following retinal 
findings in each eye: Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or AP-ROP 
(aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity). The indication has now been updated to reflect the 
patient population included in the study. In addition, the indication is now more consistent with 
recommendations for treatment stated in recent literature. According to guideline for screening 
examination of premature infants with ROP (Fierson, et al, Dec 2018), treatment should be initiated for 
Zone I ROP (any stage with plus disease); Zone I ROP stage 3 (no plus disease); as well as Zone II 
(stage 2 or 3 with plus disease).  
Thus, the revised indication appears to be acceptable at this stage. However, positive results from the 
IA2 and the final report would be considered highly relevant for a continued positive benefit/risk 
balance of the product for this indication.  
Initially, the MAH proposed to provide efficacy and safety results of IA2 as post approval commitment, 
as well as the submission of the final report submission in Q2 2023 (both Category 3).  
However, given that the initial efficacy assessment is based on surrogate endpoints, this would require 
verification of the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression or confirmation 
of previous efficacy assumptions. Accordingly, during the 2nd RSI, it was considered that the results of 
the IA2 and the final report for H2301E1 should be subject to a Category 1 commitment (Annex II D 
condition) as a PAES, interventional, with a due date Q2 2023, and including other relevant milestones. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 65/101 
 
 
 
In response to the second RSI, the MAH has agreed to this request. The submitted RMP version 18.2 
includes this PAES, classified as a Category 1 commitment with due dates of 30 June 2020 for the 
results of IA2 and 30 June 2023 for the final CSR.   
The doses administered using the 1-ml Plastipak™ syringe from Becton Dickinson in the RAINBOW 
study appeared to be higher than the target doses of 10 and 20 microliter. The Low volume high 
accuracy syringe intended for clinical use is likely to deliver a dose closer to this target dose. However, 
the slight discrepancy between the dose to be used in clinical practice and the actual doses tested in 
the RAINBOW study is not considered to be of clinical concern. The MAH is proposing to provide the 
low-volume high-accuracy syringe in the standalone device kit proposed by the MAH. In this respect it 
should be noted that adults and preterm infants represent very different target populations with 
different needs (the number of candidates and the frequency of treatment is much higher in the adult 
than in the preterm population). In addition, the use of the commercially available vial for preterm 
infants implies discarding a relevant part of the total volume of the product. Finally, the product 
information for this indication/population will partially differ from the currently approved one. With this 
in mind, developing a specific pre-filled low volume syringe would have been a preferred option to 
minimize medication errors. It will allow providing the suitable dose/volume of 0.02 ml with its own 
product information (specific to the preterm infants). However, the company has provided sufficient 
additional justification that the low volume high accuracy syringe is a safe and suitable option for this 
patient population.  
3.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the IA2 and the final report for H2301E1 have been implemented as a Category 1 
commitment (Annex II D condition) as a PAES, interventional. In addition, the MAH has agreed to take 
measures to reduce bias in the visual acuity assessments in the ongoing extension study and has 
sufficiently addressed other outstanding concerns.  
Accordingly, the benefit–risk for ranibizumab for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in 
preterm infants can be considered positive from a clinical efficacy point of view.  
3.6.  Clinical safety 
3.6.1.  Introduction 
Lucentis (ranibizumab) has been marketed in the EU since the International Birth Date (IBD) of 22 Jan 
2007 with the nAMD indication. Lucentis is currently indicated in four adult indications. Total post-
marketing patient exposure based on the number of ranibizumab vials and ranibizumab pre-filled 
syringes (PFS) sold worldwide since the IBD of the product is estimated to be approximately 3,771,644 
patient-treatment years (PTY) (PSUR 13). The overall safety profile of Lucentis in adults is well 
characterised. 
The majority of adverse reactions reported following administration of Lucentis are related to the 
intravitreal injection procedure. From the previously conducted clinical trials, the most frequently 
reported (very common) ocular adverse reactions are: 
Vitritis, vitreous detachment, retinal haemorrhage, visual disturbance, eye pain, vitreous floaters, 
conjunctival haemorrhage, eye irritation, foreign body sensation in eyes, lacrimation increased, 
blepharitis, dry eye, ocular hyperaemia, eye pruritus. 
The most frequently reported (very common) non-ocular adverse reactions are nasopharyngitis, 
headache, arthralgia and intraocular pressure (IOP) increased.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 66/101 
 
 
 
Less frequently reported (common), but more serious, ocular adverse reactions include retinal 
detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 
Less frequently reported (common) non ocular adverse reactions are urinary tract infection, anaemia, 
hypersensitivity, anxiety, cough, nausea and allergic reactions. 
Rarely reported (uncommon) ocular adverse reactions include endophthalmitis, blindness, hypopyon, 
hyphamia, keratopathy, iris adhesion, corneal deposits, corneal oedema, corneal striae, injections site 
pain, injection site irritation, abnormal sensation in eye and eyelid irritation. 
There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial 
infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. In the wet AMD phase III studies, non-ocular 
haemorrhages, an adverse event potentially related to systemic VEGF (vascular endothelial growth 
factor) inhibition, was slightly increased in ranibizumab-treated patients, without a consistent pattern 
among the different haemorrhages. An increased risk for death, CVA and vascular death following 
monthly dosing of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) in DME patients compared to sham and laser treatment, has 
been reported (studies RIDE and RISE).1 
These issues for the adult indications were raised and thoroughly assessed during the PAM 
(EMEA/H/C/715 LEG 071. However, no change to the product information was made and it was 
concluded that the current SmPC text remains appropriate.  
Though, ranibizumab is expected to have low systemic exposure following intravitreal injection, the 
distinct possibility of its systemic effects cannot be ruled out in the preterm infants with immature, and 
often impaired, blood-retinal barrier (Law, J AAPOS 2010;14:6-10). Furthermore, a recent Cochrane 
review (Sankar et al, 2018) pointed to the fact that long-term systemic adverse effects of VEGF-
inhibitors are unknown. 
3.6.2.  Clinical data 
The summary of clinical safety is based on the Core Study H2301 (completed) and the interim analysis 
of the Extension Study H2301E (ongoing), as presented in the in Table 4. Patients  who  had 
successfully  completed  the  24-week  Core  Study  H2301  were  invited  to participate in the open-
label Extension Study (Study H2301E1) to collect long-term efficacy and safety data up to the patient’s 
5th birthday.

Study H2301 was a randomised, multicenter, open-label, 3-arm, parallel-group, superiority study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg, intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg, 
and laser therapy for the treatment of ROP. 
The study population consisted of male and female preterm infants with a birth weight of <1500  g and 
with bilateral ROP with one of the following retinal findings in each eye: Zone I, stage 1+,  2+, 3 or 3+ 
disease, or Zone  II,  stage  3+  disease,  or  aggressive  posterior  retinopathy  of  prematurity (AP-
ROP). 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 3 treatment arms to receive at 
Baseline: 
− 
− 
−  Laser therapy to both eyes 
Intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg to both eyes 
Intravitreal ranibizumab 0.1 mg to both eyes 
Additional information on study design is provided in Clinical efficacy section. 
Overall analysis plan 
All analyses were based on the Safety analysis set, except for disposition, demographic and other 
characteristics at Baseline, which were based on the Randomised Set (see efficacy section).  
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one application of study treatment and 
had at least one post baseline safety assessment. The statement that a patient had no AEs also 
constituted a safety assessment. Reports using the Safety Set were by initial treatment received at 
Baseline.  
In addition to the pre-planned analyses specified for the CSR, post-hoc analyses were performed for 
exposure and ocular and non-ocular AEs/SAEs by subgroups. 
The submitted efficacy and safety data covers a total study period of 40 weeks and includes infants 
who were on average 26 gestational weeks of age at inclusion.  
During the review period, supplementary data (supp-IA) was submitted including included 177 patients 
followed-up for more than 18 months, among them 125 patients followed-up for more than two years 
The Extension Study H2301E1 is still ongoing and the final evaluation of efficacy is planned for the 
patients’ 5th birthday.

n= number of patients meeting the criterion (for categorical variables); number of patients with non-missing 
assessment (for continuous variables), SD= standard deviation.  
Note: There was one patient (), randomised to the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, who  received ranibizumab at 
a dose of 1.0 mg as initial treatment. This patient was included in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group for all 
analysis sets. Furthermore, one patient was randomised to the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and received 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg at the time of first re-treatment. 
In the ranibizumab groups, the majority received only one initial bilateral ranibizumab treatment (i.e., 
2 injections, one in each eye), 78.1 % in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and 77.6 % in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group. 
The mean number of injections per patient was similar in the two ranibizumab groups (2.4 injections 
vs. 2.5 injections), which includes the initial bilateral ranibizumab treatment. 
The mean number of ranibizumab injections received by eye was 1.2 and 1.3 in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg and 0.1 mg groups, respectively, and 1.2 in in the laser group who switched to ranibizumab. 
A total of 13/69 (18.8%) patients in the laser group switched to ranibizumab and received at least 1 
injection of ranibizumab 0.2 mg. Most patients in the laser group switching to ranibizumab, received 2 
injections (11.6%).

The pattern of injections for patients during the extension phase was in line with that during the core 
study. 
Out of the patients included in the Extension Study, on average, patients received 2.3 and 2.6 
ranibizumab injections, in the 0.2 and 0.1 mg ranibizumab group, respectively. There were 8 patients

who received ranibizumab injections in the laser group; on average, these patients received 2.4 
ranibizumab injections.  
Study H2301 showed that 78.1% and 77.6% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 and 0.1 mg group, 
respectively, received the baseline bilateral injection (counted as two injections per patient, or one 
injection per eye). ROP recurrence beyond 24 weeks was not observed and repeated injection are not 
anticipated in this population. Only two patients in the each of the ranibizumab groups required three 
injection per eye (six injections per patient). No patient received more than three injections in either 
eye. 
3.6.3.2.  Re-treatment and rescue treatment (post-hoc analyses) 
Re-treatment is discussed in the efficacy section.  
Rescue treatment was defined in the study as a switch from ranibizumab to laser within less than 28 
days from the last ranibizumab injection, whereas for laser it was defined as a switch occurring at any 
time after the initial laser (including supplemental laser). Rescue treatment was given to a lower 
proportion of patients in both ranibizumab groups than in the laser group: 7/73 (9.6 %) patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 6/76 (7.9 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, and13/69 (18.8 %) 
patients in the laser group.  
3.6.3.3.  Concomitant medication or treatments 
Ocular and non-ocular medications and significant non-drug therapies prior to start of study treatment 
as well as used on or after the first study treatment administration were overall comparable between 
treatment groups with no clinically relevant differences. For details see Clinical Study Report of core 
study.  
3.6.3.4.  Patient disposition 
Core Study H2301 
Subject disposition in ranibizumab and laser treated patients are shown in Table 10 above. 
A total of 225 patients from 87 sites in 26 countries were enrolled and randomised. The majority of 
patients (218 patients, 96.9 %) received initial (baseline) investigational treatment; study treatment in 
the follow-up phase was completed by 89.3 % of patients overall, with a slightly higher proportion of 
patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (71 patients, 92.2 %) and ranibizumab 0.2 mg (66 patients, 
89.2 %) groups than in the laser group (64 patients, 86.5 %). 
All patients of the Randomised Set were also included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), and 80.4 % of all 
randomised patients were included in the Per-Protocol Set (181 patients overall), with a higher 
proportion of patients in both ranibizumab groups (86.5 % for ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 81.8 % for 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg) than in the laser group (73.0 %).  
Seven patients were randomised but did not receive initial treatment and were discontinued from the 
study. These patients were not included in the Safety Set for safety analyses as they did not receive 
any study treatment but were included in the Full Analysis Set for efficacy analyses.  
Extension Study H2301E1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 71/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Extension Study H2301E1, at the time of the data cut-off for the first interim analysis, 144 
patients  had  either  completed  Week  40  visit  (143  patients)  or  had  been  discontinued  in  the 
Extension Study prior to Week 40 visit (1 patient discontinued due to death).  The  patient  who 
discontinued  due  to  death only received initial laser treatment at baseline in the core study.  
The number of completers was high, >95 % in all three groups and the most common reason for 
discontinuation was death, 4 patients in each group. 
No of discontinuations due to AE during treatment phase was one patient in the laser group and one 
patient in the ranibizumab (0.2 mg) group during the follow up phase. Twelve patients discontinued due 
to death, four in each group. 
3.6.3.5.  Baseline demographics and disease characteristics 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics have been described above in the Efficacy 
section. 
Growth parameters from supp-IA (cut-off 06-Feb-2019, submitted in Applicant’s response to RSI) 
At Year 2, growth data (body weight, body height and head circumference) were available from 103 
patients for body weight, from 80 patients for body height and from 83 patients for head 
circumferences [Appendix 5-Table ias–V1.1]. These growth parameters indicated a comparable growth 
of babies in all three treatment groups. The mean body weight gain at Year 2 visit relative to Baseline 
was 9867, 9421 and 10021 grams in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 0.1 mg and laser treatment groups, 
respectively, mean gain in body height was 49.9, 50.6, and 50.2 cm, respectively, and mean gain in 
head circumference was 22.5, 22.1 and 22.2 cm, respectively. 
The preliminary data from the supplemental -IA (cut-off date of 06-Feb-2019) for patients at two years 
of age did not reveal any concerns regarding in growth parameters.

* In the laser group, 13 patients (18.8 % received ranibizumab (i.e. were switched to ranibizumab treatment)  
Severity 
The majority of ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity; severe ocular AEs were reported for 
2 patients (2.7 %) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 1 patient (1.3 %) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg 
group, and 2 patients (2.9 %) in the laser group. Of those 5 patients with severe ocular AEs, 
4 patients had severe events of ROP (1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 1 patient in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, and 2 patients in the laser group). Other severe ocular AEs included 
atrophy of globe, exophthalmos, endophthalmitis, eye disorder, orbital infection (all experienced by the 
same 1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group) and nystagmus (1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
group).  
Relation to study treatment/procedure 
Overall, during the core study 76 patients (34.9 %) experienced ocular AEs, 30.1 %; 40.8 %; 33.3 % 
in respective group (Ranibizumab 0.2 mg; 0.1 mg; Laser). 
The most frequent ocular AE overall was retinal haemorrhage (23 patients, 10.6 %), followed by 
conjunctival haemorrhage (14 patients, 6.4 %), conjunctivitis (10 patients, 4.6 %), and ROP (8 
patients, 3.7 %).  
The majority of ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Out of the five severe ocular AES, 4 
patients had severe events of ROP (1 patient in each ranibizumab group and 2 patients in the laser 
group). Other severe ocular AEs included atrophy of globe, exophthalmos, endophthalmitis, eye 
disorder, orbital infection (all experienced by the same 1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group) and 
nystagmus (1 patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group). 
Ocular AEs suspected to be related to study treatment were as expected more common in the 
ranibizumab groups (11 patients (15.1 %) for ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 12 patients (15.8 %) for 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg) than in the laser group (6 patients, 8.7 %).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 73/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 9 patients (4.1 %) experienced at least one ocular SAE. There were no clinically relevant 
differences between treatment groups. The most frequent ocular SAE was ROP (6 patients, 2.8 % 
overall). There were no ocular AEs leading to permanent study discontinuation. 
Extension Study 
The incidence of ocular adverse events was overall low: 6/50 (12.0 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg group, 8/51 (15.7 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 4/43 (9.3 %) patients in the 
laser group.  
Overall the most frequently reported ocular AEs (preferred terms) were strabismus (4 patients) and 
conjunctivitis (4 patients). Most frequently reported ocular AEs (preferred terms) in the ranibizumab 
0.2 mg and 0.1 mg and the laser groups, respectively, were strabismus (2, 1 and 1 patients) and 
conjunctivitis (1, 2 and 1 patients). ROP was reported as an AE preferred term in 1 patient in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and in 1 patient in the laser group.  
The majority of ocular AEs were mild in severity. Ocular adverse events assessed as severe were 
reported in 1 patient in each group (1 patient with severe strabismus in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
group, 1 patient with severe retinal detachment in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, and 1 patient with 
severe ROP in the laser group).  
The adverse drug reactions reported are consistent with the known safety profile of Lucentis in adults.  
However, the extension study H2301E1 is still ongoing and the final evaluation of efficacy is planned 
for the patients’ 5th birthday. The preliminary data from a supplemental IA submitted as part of the 
RSI raised no new concerns regarding ocular and non-ocular safety.  
A pooled presentation of ranibizumab groups as requested during the first RSI did not show any 
unexpected findings the ocular and non-ocular events.  
Furthermore, post-baseline interventions due to ROP recurrence were necessary in 26.0 % of patients 
in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, in 35.3 % of patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and in 18.6 
% of patients in the laser group (i.e. in 165 % more subjects in ranibizumab groups that the laser 
group). 
The issue of repeated injection raised in the first RSI with regard to increased exposure as well as 
increased risk of ocular infections was alleviated by the Applicant by showing that a large majority 
(almost 80%) of the patients received only one injection/eye and the frequency of endophthalmitis was 
similar to that in adult indications.

* In the laser group, 13 patients (18.8 %) received ranibizumab (i.e., were switched to ranibizumab treatment), 
Severity 
Severe non-ocular AEs were reported for 44 patients (20.2 %) overall (17 patients (23.3 %) for 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 15 patients (19.7 %) for ranibizumab 0.1 mg, 12 patients (17.4 %) for laser), 
with no relevant differences between treatment groups. The majority of these severe AEs occurred in 
1 or 2 patients only. 
Relation to study treatment/procedure 
The only non-ocular AE suspected to be related to study treatment was an SAE of respiratory failure 
(with fatal outcome) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (discussed below). 
Overall during the core study, 177 patients (81.2 %) experienced non-ocular AEs, the most frequent 
non-ocular AEs by preferred term were pyrexia (19 patients, 8.7 %), dermatitis diaper (18 patients, 8.3 
%), anemia (18 patients, 8.3 %), and nasopharyngitis (18 patients, 8.3 %).  
Assessment report

The non-ocular events were few, primarily mild in severity. This applies also to the patients switching to 
treatment modality.  
The somewhat higher reporting rate of cardiovascular events (bradycardia 6.6% vs 1.4%) and 
respiratory events (upper respiratory tract infection (8.2% vs 1.4%) was further analysed in the first 
RSI.  
However, due to limited data in general and a high prevalence of co-morbidities, the data is not 
conclusive. 
Extension Study 
The incidence of non-ocular AEs was numerically lower in both ranibizumab groups than in the laser 
group (58.0 %, 58.8 % and 72.1 % in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg and the laser groups, 
respectively).  
The most commonly affected System Organ Classes were infections and infestations (46.0 %, 37.3 % 
and 39.5 % of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg and the laser groups, respectively, of 
which the most frequent event (preferred term) was nasopharyngitis, 12.0 %, 15.7 % and 11.6 %, 
respectively); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (20.0 %, 13.7 % and 25.6 %, 
respectively, of which the most frequent event was cough, 4.0 %, 5.9 % and 7.0 %, respectively); and 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (10.0 %, 7.8 % and 9.3 %, respectively, with no specific event 
being reported in more than 1 patient per group). Most AEs were reported in single or very few 
patients only.  
The majority of non-ocular AEs were reported as mild or moderate in severity. Severe non-ocular AEs 
were reported in 7.6 % of overall patients, with no major differences between treatment groups: 3/50 
(6.0 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 4/51 (7.8 %) patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg 
group, and 4/43 (9.3 %) patients in the laser group. Each of the severe AEs were reported in not more 
than 1 patient overall. 
The non-ocular events were few, primarily mild in severity during Extension Study. There were no 
major differences between treatment groups regarding the frequency of particular preferred terms 
during the 40-week study. 
No evident differences were found between treatment groups during the core and Extension Study with 
the most frequently reported non-ocular adverse events of pyrexia, dermatitis diaper, nasopharyngitis. 
No new non-ocular AEs were identified during the 40-week study and in general data is in agreement 
with the known safety profile of ranibizumab in adults. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The proportion of patients who died or experienced SAEs or AEs leading to permanent discontinuation 
of study treatment are shown in Table 28.  
Overall, 12 patients (5.5 %) died during the study; 74 patients (33.9 %) experienced SAEs, and 16 
patients (7.3 %) discontinued study treatment due to SAEs. One patient (ranibizumab 0.1 mg group; 
1.3 %) discontinued study treatment due to a non-serious AE (mild conjunctivitis in both eyes, not 
suspected by the Investigator to be related to study treatment or procedure).

Overall, 12 patients (5.5 %) died during the study, with similar proportions across treatment groups 
(4 patients in each group). The most commonly affected primary SOC was respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (5 patients (2.3 %) overall; 2 patients (2.7 %) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 
1 patient (1.3 %) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 2 patients (2.9 %) in the laser group), 
followed by infections and infestations (3 patients (1.4 %) overall; 2 patients (2.7 %) in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 1 patient (1.3 %) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 0 patients (0 %) in 
the laser group). 
The event of respiratory failure was suspected by the Investigator to be related to study treatment. For 
all other event, no causality to study treatment or procedure was suspected by the Investigator. 
Of the patients who switched treatment modality, 1 patient (in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group) died 
due to an event of pneumonia. All other deaths occurred in patients who did not switch treatment 
modality  
Extension Study 
There was one death reported in the Extension Safety Set (a patient  in the laser group). At the time 
of enrolment in the Extension Study the patient’s historical conditions included (reported terms) 
Sepsis heterolytic  staphylococcus  and  Sepsis  pseudomonas  aeruginosa.  Current  conditions  included 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, myocardial hypertrophy, apnea, periventricular leukomalacia and  CMV 
(cytomegalovirus) infection. The patient had not received any study medication as part  of the

Extension Study. The  death  was  due  to  septic  shock and the investigator assessed the event septic 
shock as not suspected to study treatment.  
During the Core Study twelve deaths (four patients in each treatment group) were reported, with the 
most commonly affected primary SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (5 patients (2.3 
%) overall), followed by infections and infestations (3 patients (1.4 % overall).  
Except for one event of respiratory failure, none of the events leading to death was suspected by the 
Investigator to be related to study treatment. However, this conclusion that the majority of the 
deaths were not considered related to study treatment is difficult to fully evaluate, considering the 
uncertainty regarding the role of VEGF as well as comorbidities in this sensitive population.

The incidence of ocular SAEs was low (9 patients (4.1 %) overall) and the most frequent ocular SAE by 
PT was ROP, reported for 2 patients (2.7 %) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 1 patient (1.3 %) in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, and 3 patients (4.3 %) in the laser group. All other ocular SAEs (cataract, 
nystagmus, conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, exophthalmos, eye disorder, and orbital infection) were 
each reported for only 1 patient (0.5 %) overall.  
The SAE of cataract was suspected by the Investigator to be related to study procedure but not to 
study treatment, and the SAEs of endophthalmitis, exophthalmos and orbital infection that occurred in 
one patient were suspected by the Investigator to be related to study procedure and to study 
treatment.  
The Investigator commented that “the relationship between the SAEs and both the study procedure 
and treatment was suspected because of the short time interval to the onset of SAE”. All other ocular 
SAEs were not suspected by the Investigator to be related to study procedure/study treatment.  
Extension Study 
The incidence of serious ocular AEs in the Extension Safety Set was 2.8 % overall (4 patients). ROP 
was reported as an SAE preferred term in 1 patient (2.0 %) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and in 1 
Assessment report

patient (2.3 %) in the laser group. Serious retinal detachment and nystagmus was reported in 1 
patient each in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group. No ocular SAEs were reported in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg group. 
Overall, at least one ocular SAE was experienced by 9 patients (4.1%) in the core study and 4 patients 
(2.8%) in the Extension Study. The most frequent ocular SAE was ROP (6 patients, 2.8 % overall in 
the core study). 
Although the number of patients experiencing ocular SAEs were similar in the ranibizumab groups 
compared to the laser group, more ocular events were reported in the ranibizumab treated patients, 
which is consistent with the known safety profile in adults. Cataract, endophthalmitis, exophthalmos, 
and orbital infection were suspected by investigator to be related to study treatment or causality, this 
is agreed.  
In the first review round, the potential risk of frequent injections and increased risk of endophthalmitis 
was discussed.  
In study H2301, 78.1% and 77.6% of the patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 0.1 mg, respectively 
received only baseline bilateral injection (counted as two injections per patient or one injection per 
eye). Only two patients in each ranibizumab groups required three injections per eye (six injections per 
patient). No patient received more than three injections per eye. Thus, the expected duration of 
treatment in clinical practice for patients with ROP was clarified in the SmPC (section 4.2). 
This together with a summary presenting similar endophthalmitis in the paediatric population as in the 
approved adult indication, alleviates this concern of an increased risk of endophthalmitis in this 
population. 
As treatment is contraindicated in patients with ocular and periocular infection the MAH was requested 
to discuss the possible need for defining a strategy for ROP patients with a concurrent systemic 
infection. Overall, there currently appears to be no data indicating an increased risk in relation to 
ranibizumab treatment in ROP patients with ongoing systemic infections or an increased risk of 
exogenous infectious endophthalmitis in such patients.

Overall, 70 patients (32.1 %) experienced non-ocular SAEs. The most commonly affected primary 
SOCs were infections and infestations (31 patients, 14.2 % overall), respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (22 patients, 10.1 % overall), and gastrointestinal disorders (18 patients, 8.3 % 
overall).  
The most common non-ocular SAEs by PT were pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia (all 6 patients (2.8 %) overall), followed by apnea and respiratory failure (both 4 patients 
(1.8 %) overall).  
There was 1 patient  in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (1.3 %) with a non-ocular SAE (respiratory 
failure) that was suspected by the Investigator to be related to study treatment or procedure. This 
severe event had a fatal outcome and was reported for a patient who did not switch treatment 
modality during the study.  
There were no clinically relevant differences in the incidence of non-ocular SAEs for patients who 
switched treatment modality and for patients who did not switch treatment modality. 
Extension Study 
The incidence of serious non-ocular AEs was comparable across treatment groups (11 patients in each 
group, corresponding to 22.0 %, 21.6 % and 25.6 % in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg groups 
and the laser group, respectively). 
The most frequent serious non-ocular AEs in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 0.1 mg and laser group, 
respectively, were bronchitis (1, 1 and 3 patients) and pneumonia (1, 1 and 2 patients). Apart from 
these, most of the serious non-ocular AEs were reported for 1 or 2 patients overall. 
Taken together, the non-ocular serious AEs in the core study and Extension Study were similar across 
treatment groups with the primarily affected SOCs were ‘Infections and infestations’, ‘Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders’, and ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’. The most common non-ocular SAE 
(n>5) were pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 
Although there was a slight imbalance of higher reporting of respiratory-related events in the 
ranibizumab groups compared to laser, however, due to confounding factors as and medical history, 
the data is inconclusive.   
Overall, a trend of higher AE incidences reported for patients with lower gestational age (<27 weeks) 
as well as lower birthweight (≤ 750 g) was observed in the ranibizumab pooled group and the laser 
group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 80/101 
 
 
 
 
This was also reflected in Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (<27 weeks resp <1000g). 
The same pattern applied to serious AEs with even fewer patients. However, due to the small sample 
size, this should be interpreted with caution. 
Other significant events 
Hospitalisation [Study H2301-Table 14.2-11.1] and requirement of respiratory support [Study H2301-
Table 14.3-6.1a] and [Study H2301-Table 14.3-6.1b] were analyzed as additional exploratory safety 
parameters. According to Applicant, no clinically relevant differences were observed between treatment 
groups.  
Laboratory findings 
No safety concerns arose from laboratory safety parameters and vital sign/physical examination 
assessments. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the core study, there were no ocular AEs leading to permanent study discontinuation. 
Overall, 13 patients (6.0 %) had non-ocular AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment, with a similar proportion of patients across treatment groups (5 patients (6.8 %) in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 4 patients (5.3 %) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, and 4 patients (5.8 
%) in the laser group).  
There was 1 patient (in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group; 1.4 %) who experienced a non-ocular AE 
leading to permanent study discontinuation (AE of gastroenteritis). For the other 12 patients, the 
reason for discontinuing study treatment in the follow-up phase was death. 
In the Extension Study, there were no discontinuations in the ranibizumab groups during the 
extension, but one patient discontinued in the laser group due to death. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019

Overall the discontinuations were few and mainly non-ocular events and related to the comorbidity of 
ROP patients. 
Long term safety data from supp-IA (cut-off 06-Feb-2019, submitted in 
Applicant’s response to RSI) 
Ocular and non-ocular AEs were assessed for all 180 patients participating in Study H2301E1. Of all 
180 patients, three patients discontinued (two patients due to consent withdrawal and one patient due 
to death) the study before reaching 18 months of safety observation. Therefore, the supp-IA included 
177 patients followed-up for more than 18 months, among them 125 patients followed-up for more 
than two years [Appendix 5-Table ias-S3]. 
Ocular AEs in Study H2301E1 were reported for 13.1%, 18.5% and 16.7% of patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser groups, respectively (Table 1-2). Most frequent 
were strabismus and conjunctivitis, with no major differences between treatment groups. Myopia was 
reported as AE in a total of 5 patients (1.6%, 1.5% and 5.6% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser groups, respectively). All other events were reported in single patients 
per treatment arm. 
The incidence of ocular SAEs was low; none were reported for the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and the laser 
groups, and three (4.6%) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (one patient each with retinal detachment, 
retinopathy of prematurity (AE verbatim progression of retinopathy of prematurity) and nystagmus). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019

Non-ocular AEs were reported for 62.3%, 56.9% and 72.2% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 
0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively (Table 1-3). Most frequent were nasopharyngitis 
(14.3% overall), pyrexia (10.6%) and bronchitis (8.9%). Generally, no major differences were noted 
across the three treatment groups. 
Non-ocular SAEs were reported for 29.5%, 29.2% and 33.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively (Table 1-4). Most frequent overall were bronchitis 
(0%, 4.6% and 9.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, 
respectively) and pneumonia (3.3%, 1.5% and 5.6%, respectively).

The most frequent ocular AEs were strabismus (n=3, n=5, n=3 in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg 
groups and the laser group, respectively) and conjunctivitis (n=2 in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 
mg groups and the laser group, respectively). 
Three serious ocular AE was reported in the 0.1 mg ranibizumab group (retinal detachment, 
retinopathy of prematurity, nystagmus).  
Most frequent non-ocular AEs were bronchitis (0%, 4.6% and 9.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively) and pneumonia (3.3%, 1.5% and 5.6%, 
respectively). 
In summary, no clinically significant differences were observed for ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs 
across the treatment groups.  
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing exposure for ranibizumab is limited to approved indications in adults. Lucentis 
(ranibizumab) has been marketed since the International Birth Date (IBD) of 30 Jun 2006 with the 
nAMD indication. Total post-marketing patient exposure based on the number of ranibizumab vials and 
ranibizumab pre-filled syringes (PFS) sold worldwide since the IBD of the product is estimated to be 
approximately 5 million patient treatment years (PTY). 
The PSUR cycle was recently changed to 3 years. 
During the last PSUR reporting period no new safety concerns were evoked. Routine pharmacovigilance 
was regarded as sufficient. The risk-benefit balance remained unchanged and there was no need for 
changes of the risk management plan (RMP) at the time. 
3.6.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
CRFB002H2301E1 (RAINBOW) is a currently ongoing multicentre open-label Extension Study 
evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of ranibizumab treatment in preterm infants with ROP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 85/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients who had successfully completed the 24-week Core Study CRFB002H2301 were offered to 
participate in the Extension Study. Ranibizumab as study treatment was permitted for eligible eyes up 
to and including the Week 40 visit (Epoch 1), corresponding to 40 weeks after a patient received the 
first study treatment in the Core Study. Treatment with ranibizumab was permitted, either as 
retreatment for patients who had received ranibizumab as the last treatment prior to joining the 
Extension Study or as switch treatment for patients who only received laser therapy in the Core Study 
CRFB002H2301 and required additional treatment in the Extension Study. 
A maximum of 3 ranibizumab injections in each eye were allowed during the combined time period of 
the Core Study plus Epoch 1 of the Extension Study. The remainder of the Extension Study (Epoch 2) 
is observational. 
This is the first of the three planned interim analyses planned for RAINBOW. Interim analysis 2 will be 
conducted on all patients at 2 years’ corrected age, and the final analyses will be conducted at the 
completion of the study when the patients are 5 years of age. During review period, the Applicant 
submitted preliminary data (sub IA, cut off 6 Feb 2019) including 177 patients followed-up for more 
than 18 months, among them 125 patients followed-up for more than two years. 
Of the 225 patients who were randomised into the Core Study, 218 patients were treated and 201 
patients completed the Core Study. The safety set included 76 patients treated with ranibizumab 
0.1 mg; 73 patients with 0.2 mg and 69 patients treated with laser.  
At the time of the data cut-off for this interim analysis (initial submission), 144 patients had either 
completed Week 40 visit (143 patients) or had been discontinued in the Extension Study prior to Week 
40 visit (1 patient discontinued due to death).  
A majority of patients (66.1 %) completed up to 40 weeks post baseline (time point of data cut-off for 
the first interim CSR).  
Exposure and Demography 
During the Core Study, in the laser group 13/69 patients (18.8 %) switched to ranibizumab treatment 
(with a mean of 2.2 injections/patient) compared with 11/73 patients (15.1 %) and 10/76 patients 
(13.2 %) in the 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg ranibizumab groups, respectively, who switched to laser.  
During the Extension Study, of the 144 patients, only one patient  received ranibizumab 0.1 mg re-
treatment in both eyes at the Extension baseline visit.  
The mean number of injections/patient was similar in the two ranibizumab groups (2.4 injections in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg group vs 2.5 injections in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group) during the core study as 
well as during the extension phase (2.3 vs 2.6). 
The study was generally balanced between the ranibizumab and laser treatment groups with regards 
to baseline demographics and ROP baseline characteristics with the majority classified with non-ROP 
status (86.2 %) and Zone II, stage 3+ (60.0 %).  
As  the  included  population  is  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  gestational  age,  birth  weight  and  country  of 
origin, it should be taken into account that the population of infants with severe disease in emerging 
economies is very different from that in industrialized countries and the risks under different conditions 
(standard of care, timing of treatment, etc). The Applicant presented a specific analysis of the safety 
profile in each population. The observation of higher frequencies of (S)AEs being reported in Region 1 
than  Region  2  is  expected,  as  Region  1  included  a  much  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  severe 
prematurity as indicated by low GA and lower birth weight. According the MAH, the observed differences 
in frequencies of ocular and non-ocular (S)AEs between Region 1 and Region 2 can be attributed to a 
higher  proportion  of  patients  with  severe  prematurity  in  Region  1  than  in  Region  2,  which  appears 
reasonable.

Core Study 
Overall, during the core study 76 patients (34.9 %) experienced ocular AEs, the most commonly 
reported ocular AEs overall was retinal haemorrhage, followed by conjunctival haemorrhage, 
conjunctivitis, and ROP. A higher reporting in any ranibizumab group vs laser was found for the 
following: Conjunctival haemorrhage (8.2% n=6 vs 2.9% n=2); Retinal haemorrhage (13.2% n=10 vs 
10.1% n=7); Conjunctivitis (7.9% n=6 vs 4.3% n=3).  The adverse drug reactions reported are 
consistent with the known safety profile of Lucentis in adults. No new safety concerns are evoked. 
Overall, 9 patients (4.1 %) experienced at least one ocular SAE. The most frequent ocular SAE was 
ROP (6 patients, 2.8 % overall). There were no clinically relevant differences between treatment 
groups. There were no ocular AEs leading to permanent study discontinuation. All other ocular SAEs 
(cataract, nystagmus, conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, exophthalmos, eye disorder, and orbital 
infection) were each reported for 1 patient only (0.5 %).  
Overall, in the core study, 177 patients (81.2 %) experienced non-ocular AEs (mostly mild, moderate), 
with no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups; the most frequent non-ocular AEs by 
preferred term were pyrexia (19 patients, 8.7 %), dermatitis diaper (18 patients, 8.3 %), anemia 
(18 patients, 8.3 %), and nasopharyngitis (18 patients, 8.3 %).  
Extension Study 
The most frequently reported ocular AEs (majority mild) were strabismus (4 patients) and 
conjunctivitis (4 patients), and a somewhat increased reporting of eye disorders in the ranibizumab 
groups (10.0 % and 9.8 %) compared to the laser group (7.0 %). 
Serious ocular AEs was only reported in the 0.1 mg dose group, in 4 patients, including ROP (n=1); 
Serious retinal detachment (n=1) and Nystagmus (n=1). In the laser group one case of ROP was 
reported. 
The incidence of non-ocular AEs (primarily mild) was lower in both ranibizumab groups than in the 
laser group (58.0 %, 58.8 % and 72.1 % in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg and the laser groups, 
respectively). The most commonly affected System Organ Classes were Infections and infestations, 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and Metabolism and nutrition disorders.  
Deaths 
Overall, 12 patients (5.5 %) died during the core study, with similar proportions across treatment 
groups (4 patients in each group). One patient died during the extension study. The most commonly 
affected system organ class was respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (5 patients (2.3 %), 
followed by infections and infestations (3 patients (1.4 %). Thus, deaths included the primarily the 
system organ classes related to comorbidity of ROP. However, in this context, it is noted that there is 
an imbalance in systemic serious adverse effects (including death) related to the respiratory organ 
system in the ranibizumab groups compared to laser treatment, however, due to confounding factors, 
the data is inconclusive.  
Overall, in the analysis during the review round, a trend of higher AE incidences reported for patients 
with lower gestational age (<27 weeks) as well as lower birthweight (≤ 750 g) was observed in the 
ranibizumab pooled group and the laser group. This was also reflected in Respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders (<27 weeks resp <1000g). The same pattern applied to serious AEs with even 
fewer patients. However, due to the small sample size, this should be interpreted with caution.  
The plasma analysis showed ranibizumab concentrations considerably higher (10-15 times) compared 
to adult levels, however, the VEGF were at the same level regardless of treatment (ranibizumab or 
Assessment report

laser). The significance of this is currently unknown. High plasma levels of bevacizumab resulting in 
reduced levels of VEGF have previously been shown in preterm ROP patients (Sato et al, 2012).  
However, in the current application, a PK/PD analysis showed no clear relationship between systemic 
ranibizumab concentrations and systemic VEGF concentrations. 
Long term safety data from the supp-IA (cut off 06 Feb 2019) 
Ocular and non-ocular AEs were assessed for all 180 patients participating in Study H2301E1. Of all 
180 patients, three patients discontinued (two patients due to consent withdrawal and one patient due 
to death) the study before reaching 18 months of safety observation. Therefore, the supp-IA included 
177 patients followed-up for more than 18 months, among them 125 patients followed-up for more 
than two years 
Ocular AEs were reported for 13.1%, 18.5% and 16.7% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser groups, respectively  
The most frequent ocular AEs were strabismus (n=3, n=5, n=3 in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg 
groups and the laser group, respectively) and conjunctivitis (n=2 in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 
mg groups and the laser group, respectively). Myopia was reported as AE in a total of 5 patients 
(1.6%, 1.5% and 5.6% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser groups, 
respectively). All other events were reported in single patients per treatment arm. 
Three serious ocular AE was reported in the 0.1 mg ranibizumab group (retinal detachment, 
retinopathy of prematurity, nystagmus).  
Non-ocular AEs were reported for 62.3%, 56.9% and 72.2% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 
0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively. Most frequent non-ocular AEs were bronchitis (0%, 
4.6% and 9.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, 
respectively) and pneumonia (3.3%, 1.5% and 5.6%, respectively). 
Non-ocular SAEs were reported for 29.5%, 29.2% and 33.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively. Most frequent overall were bronchitis (0%, 4.6% 
and 9.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively) 
and pneumonia (3.3%, 1.5% and 5.6%, respectively). 
Taken together, in the core study and Extension Study (including preliminary supp-IA data), no new 
ocular AEs or non-ocular AEs were identified during the 40-week study and data is in general in 
agreement with the known safety profile of ranibizumab in adults and with the comorbidity of the 
preterm population. However, the intended patient population is particularly vulnerable undergoing 
critical organ development. Although the limited long-term safety data from the supp-IA showed no 
clinically significant differences for ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs across the treatment groups, 
the long-term effects are uncertain. 
Furthermore, there could possibly be increased risk of endophthalmitis due to frequent injections in 
this infection-prone population. 
However, almost 80% of the patients received no more than one baseline bilateral injection and the 
frequency of endophthalmitis was similar to that for approved adult indications. Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC was proposed to be updated with this information which is agreed. In addition, the Applicant has 
agreed to enrich the collection of relevant data for future PSUR discussions by collecting prior history 
of periocular infection for events of endophthalmitis.  
As treatment with ranibizumab is contraindicated for patients with ocular and periocular infections, the 
potential need of a strategy for patients with concurrent systemic infections was discussed by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 88/101 
 
 
 
Applicant. However, currently there are no indications of increased risk for ranibizumab treatment in 
ROP patients with concurrent systemic infections and the SmPC is considered adequate at this time.  
3.6.6.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Lucentis appears to be in line with that reported in adults in the previously 
approved indications. However, considering this sensitive preterm infant population and the important 
role of VEGF during development, there are uncertainties related to long-term safety in this population.  
3.6.7.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the fact that the ROP population is very different from the adult population with regard to the 
critical role of VEGF in organogenesis in the pre-term infants, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
already existing entry in the EURD list for ranibizumab needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR 
cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle. 
4.  Risk management plan   
4.1.  Summary of updates of the RMP 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 18.1, sign off 2019-03-20, in support of new indication of 
treatment of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. The (main) proposed RMP changes were 
the following: 
Important identified risks 
No change 
Important potential risks 
Proposed for addition: 
Neurodevelopment impairment (ROP) 
Impaired bone growth and toxicity (ROP) 
Impaired vital organ development (ROP) 
Missing information 
Proposed for addition: 
Long term safety of ranibizumab in the condition ROP 
Pharmacovigilance activities: 
Addition of study CRFB002H2301E1 
Risk minimisation activity: 
No change, addition, or deletion made since V17.2. 
The RMP has been updated with the important potential risks:  
- Neurodevelopment impairment (ROP) 
- Impaired bone growth and toxicity (ROP) 
- Impaired vital organ development (ROP) 
During the review period, RMP 18.0 (not approved) was updated to v 18.1 with the specific risks of 
impaired bone growth and toxicity respectively vital organ development (ROP). However, the detailed 
risks ‘impaired bone growth and toxicity’ and ’impaired vital organ development’ were questioned and 
the Applicant was requested to further explain and justify the inclusion of these particular potential 
risks. In response, the Applicant agreed to remove these risks (‘impaired bone growth and toxicity’ and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 89/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
’vital organ development’) as they were insufficiently supported by current study data and/or 
literature-based sources.  
This is agreed at present (for details see response to LoQ). 
In addition, the safety concern of ‘Neurodevelopment impairment’ was requested to be further 
discussed and justified by the Applicant in the previous round. Thus, the assessment of impairment of 
cognitive function, language development and motor function in the extension study was described in 
detail as well as the anticipated outcome (For details see response to LoQ). The concern is considered 
adequately addressed and inclusion of ‘Neurodevelopmental impairment is agreed. 
In addition, the MAH has agreed to include a dedicated discussion on this topic in future PSURs.   
The RMP has been updated to include the following Missing information: 
Long-term safety of ranibizumab in the condition ROP 
This is considered acceptable. 
Following the 2nd RSI, the RMP was updated to version 18.2 which included revisions to the safety 
specification. 
Summary of safety concerns 
Important identified risks 
Infectious endophthalmitis 
Intraocular inflammation 
Retinal detachment and retinal tear 
Intraocular pressure increase 
Important potential risks

Long-term effects on the progression of the condition CNV (other than 
nAMD) 
Long-term safety of ranibizumab in the condition ROP 
The revised safety specification is acceptable. 
4.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
For the paediatric ROP indication, the long-term efficacy and safety Extension Study H2301E1 was 
initially added as additional pharmacovigilance study. Long-term data will be collected up to the 
patients’ 5th birthday, with an interim analysis at the corrected age of 2 years.  
The collection of additional safety data from this study is supported. Furthermore, additional visual 
outcome data will be obtained from this study. These visual data are considered key to the evaluation 
of long-term benefit of ranibizumab in the treatment of ROP.   
The Applicant has acknowledged the request that the results of the IA2 and the final report for 
H2301E1 be subject to a Category 1 commitment as a PAES (Annex IID condition) (For details see 
response to second RSI).

Planned and ongoing post-authorization efficacy studies that are conditions of the 
marketing authorization or that are specific obligations  
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan 
The MAH has added the Extension Study H2301E1 as a category 1 study into the RMP. This is 
acceptable. 
4.3.  Risk Minimisation Measures 
To  ensure  that  patients  are  adequately  informed  about  the  potential  to  develop  intraocular  pressure 
increase, intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment and retinal tear and infectious endophthalmitis 
after an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab, a patient information booklet (also available in spoken form 
in audio-CD format) was developed. The booklets are provided to the physician for distribution to the 
patient after ranibizumab is prescribed to them.  
No additional risk minimisation measures are proposed for the paediatric ROP patients. Specifically, no 
educational materials are proposed to parents/guardians of paediatric patients receiving ranibizumab for 
the treatment of ROP. The majority of the ROP patients will be hospitalised in neonatal intensive care 
and regularly supervised by health care professionals and thus no educational material for caregivers as 
proposed by the Applicant is considered acceptable. 
Parents/guardians can obtain relevant information on the use of ranibizumab for the treatment of ROP 
from the PL.  
Annexes 
The targeted follow-up (TFU) checklists in Annex 4 of the RMP was updated to collect relevant 
information for discussion in future PSURs. Newly included queries are Gestational age and Birth 
weight for all reported AEs from ROP patients treated with ranibizumab. For reported events of 
Endophthalmitis, prior history of periocular infection will be queried in addition to the existing follow-up 
request.  
Overall conclusions on Risk Minimisation Measures 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 91/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No additional risk minimisation measures are proposed for ROP patients. The fact that the caregivers are 
provided  with  the  PL  and  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  patients  are  hospitalised  is  in  this  regard 
considered adequate.  
4.4.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
Overall, the collection of additional safety data from the extension study H2301E1 is supported. 
No educational material as a risk minimisation measure is proposed for the ROP patients, this is 
acceptable.  
The RMP version 18.2 is acceptable. 
PRAC Outcome on RMP version 18.1 (dated 20 March 2019)  
During the plenary meeting held on 13-16 May 2019, the PRAC fully supported the assessment of the 
pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisation measures (RMMs) as detailed in the assessment report 
(AR) and agreed that the RMP for Lucentis (ranibizumab) in the proposed indication could be acceptable 
provided that an update to RMP version 18.1 and satisfactory responses to the questions detailed in the 
joint CHMP-PRAC JAR are submitted. 
Additionally,  the  PRAC  agreed  that  it  is  not  required  for  Lucentis  to  be  included  in  the  additional 
monitoring list.

5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The following sections of the SmPC are suggested to be updated; 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.5 
and 6.6, and the Package Leaflet and Labelling have been updated accordingly.  
Please refer to Attachment 1. 
5.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found partially acceptable for the following 
reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Lucentis currently approved PL. The bridging report 
submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable for content but unacceptable for layout. A focus test 
on the layout was requested to make sure that the reader easily finds the correct information (i.e. the 
correct side of the double-sided PL) and to test the increased leaflet dimension. 
The Applicant submitted the results of the focus test with the responses to the second RSI.  
The applicant has submitted a focus test to ascertain the readability of layout of the PL for Lucentis vial 
presentation. An assessment of technical and procedural aspects of the user test is not performed by 
the Rapporteur. The Rapporteur has focused the assessment of the user test on the Summary of 
results/Conclusions including feedback from participants. 
The general impression of the leaflet (content, layout and language) was mostly positive according to 
the responses given on the general questions. 
As stated in the applicant´s report conclusion, the results of User Testing demonstrated that all 
participants were able to find the correct side of the leaflet. The results also demonstrated that for 
both sides of the leaflet, at least 90% of the participants were able to find each point of information 
and at least 90% of those were able to understand it. 
The test met the success criteria. 
In conclusion, the user test is considered acceptable. The Rapporteur suggested some additional 
changes to the PL due to the result of the user test. These are considered to further improve 
readability and have been implicated by the applicant.

6.  Benefit−Risk Balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied new indication is the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). 
The pathophysiology of ROP is characterised by abnormal neovascularisation. The disruption of 
angiogenesis in preterm infants with ROP typically occurs in two postnatal phases. In the vaso-
obliterative phase (phase 1), the normally high arterial oxygen saturation in the postnatal life, coupled 
with hyperoxia secondary to oxygen supplementation, leads to involution and loss of formed blood 
vessels. In the vaso-proliferative phase (phase 2), the relatively hypoxic environment due to ischaemia 
caused by vessel loss coupled with the high metabolic demands of the avascular retina leads to 
upregulation of various angiogenic factors, resulting in abnormal neovascularisation (Sankar et al, 
2018). The extent and severity of ROP are traditionally described in terms of location (zones; I to III), 
severity (stages; 1 to 5), extent (clock hours; 1 to 12), and vascular dilatation and tortuosity (plus 
disease) according to the International Classification of ROP definitions. In 2005, the classification was 
revised to include aggressive posterior ROP (AP-ROP), pre-plus disease, and a practical way to 
estimate the extent of zone I with the indirect ophthalmoscope (Arch Ophthalmol. 2005). 
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis in foetal life. In the 
normally developing retina, VEGF is released in response to the higher oxygen demand of the retinal 
tissue, which leads to the development of blood vessels from the optic nerve to the periphery. In 
preterm infants with disrupted angiogenesis, however, the expression and levels of VEGF differ 
markedly in the two different phases. While the levels are suppressed in the vaso-obliterative phase, 
there is an overproduction/ expression of VEGF, leading to abnormal vascular proliferation in the vaso-
proliferative phase (Sankar et al 2018). The vascular changes may be mild and may regress with time 
or may continue to progress, leading to total retinal detachment, and severe visual impairment or 
blindness (Hardy et al, 2004). 
Incidence and severity of ROP were found to rise with the degree of prematurity at birth, with low 
gestational age and low birth-weight being the main risk factors (Hartnett and Penn 2012, Fierson et al 
2013). According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, in 2015 there were about 50,000 
children aged 5-14 years and about 42,000 children aged <5 years blind from ROP worldwide (GBD 
Collaborative Network 2016). 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Left untreated, ROP may lead to strabismus, myopia, glaucoma, cataract, retinal detachment and 
blindness early or later in life. The current treatment strategy for ROP involves peripheral ablation of 
the retina by laser coagulation (laser therapy). The established retina ablation techniques result in a 
significant improvement in long-term visual function, however, 10 % to 15 % of the patients with 
high-risk disease experience progression to tractional retinal detachment. Further, the retina ablation 
techniques may also cause myopia and loss of peripheral visual field. In addition, the laser treatment 
per se often requires sedation or general anaesthesia. Thus, there is a need for additional treatment 
strategies.  
VEGF, a regulator of angiogenesis, plays a key role in the progression of ROP and is involved in both 
phases of ROP pathophysiology. Thus, there is a scientific rationale for targeting elevated ocular VEGF 
in the treatment of ROP in preterm infants. 
Assessment report

Page 94/101 
 
 
 
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A randomised, open-label, 3-arm parallel-group study was submitted to determine if intravitreal 
ranibizumab (0.1 mg, n=76 and 0.2 mg, n=73) is superior to laser ablation therapy (n=69) in the 
treatment of ROP in infants born prematurely with retinopathy of prematurity (Study H2301, 
RAINBOW). A total of 225 preterm infants (mean gestational age 26.1 weeks) with ROP were 
randomised of whom 218 received investigational treatment. Patients should have bilateral ROP with 1 
of the following retinal findings in each eye: Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or Zone II, stage 
3+ disease, or AP-ROP. Treatment success, the primary efficacy variable, was defined as the absence 
of active ROP and absence of unfavourable structural outcomes before or at 24 weeks. A 3-step 
sequential superiority testing procedure was used for primary (ranibizumab 0.2 mg against laser) and 
2 key secondary comparisons (ranibizumab 0.1 mg against laser and ranibizumab 0.2 mg against 0.1 
mg). The FAS population included 225 patients. 
Study H2302E1 (RAINBOW extension) is a currently ongoing Extension Study evaluating the long-term 
efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg compared with laser therapy. Ranibizumab 
treatment was permitted for eligible eyes up to and including the Week 40 visit.. The remainder of the 
Extension Study up to the age of 5 years is observational. 
Both studies are part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP-EMEA-000527-PIP04-13-M01) for 
ranibizumab.  
The initial submission consisted of the final results of the pivotal 24-week Study H2301, supplemented 
by the results of a predefined first interim analysis  of the extension Study H2301E1. At the time point, 
144 patients had either completed the Week 40 visit in the Extension Study.  
6.2.  Favourable effects 
In the Core Study, 80.0% treatment success was observed in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 
compared with 75.0% in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group and 66.2% in the laser group. Superiority of 
0.2 mg ranibizumab over laser ablation therapy was not formally demonstrated as the one-sided p-
value 0.0254 was marginally above the significance level of 0.025 (OR: 2.19, CI: 0.9932, 4.8235). The 
remaining key efficacy comparisons were assessed descriptively; the ORs for the comparison of 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg vs. laser and ranibizumab 0.2 mg vs. ranibizumab 0.1 mg were 1.57 (95% CI 
[0.7604, 3.2587]) and 1.35 (95% CI [0.6101, 2.9810]), respectively. The conducted sensitivity 
analyses were supportive of the primary analysis. 
Regarding individual components of primary efficacy variable, active ROP in either eye at the 24-week 
assessment visit was reported only in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group (3 patients, 4.3%) but not in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg and laser groups.  
A lower proportion of patients in both ranibizumab groups compared to the laser group required 
intervention for ROP in either eye at or before the 24-week assessment visit with a treatment modality 
other than the study treatment received at Baseline: 11 patients (14.9%) for ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 
13 patients (16.9%) for ranibizumab 0.1 mg vs. 18 patients (24.3%) for laser. Most patients (78%) 
received a single injection per eye (2 injections in total) without the need for retreatment. No patient 
in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group was re-treated beyond Week 24. 
 Fewer patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group (1 patient, 1.4%) than in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg (5 
patients, 6.7%) and laser (7 patients, 10.1%) groups had one or more unfavourable structural 
outcomes in either eye at or before 24 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 95/101 
 
 
 
 
In the ongoing Extension Study H2301E1, the absence of ocular structural abnormalities at Week 40 
was 49/50 patients (98.0 %) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and 50/51 patients (98.0 %) in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group as compared with 38/43 patients (88.4 %) in the laser group.  
. 
No cases of active ROP were detected at 40 weeks post baseline visit. 
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The medicinal product should be administered to preterm infants with the new low-volume, high-
accuracy syringe specifically referred to in the SmPC. While the doses in the clinical study were 
administered with a different syringe than the above-mentioned low-volume high-accuracy syringe 
intended for clinical use, there is no expected negative impact on efficacy by the small volume 
difference between these syringes. 
No statistical significance was demonstrated for the primary endpoint. Nevertheless, it appears from 
the data that ranibizumab is at least as effective as laser therapy with regard to the primary endpoint 
even if a non-inferiority test was not planned in the study and a non-inferiority margin not defined.  
No follow-up data are yet available to conclude on long-term visual outcomes. The protocol to the 
Extension Study introduces measures to assess visual acuity at the child’s 2 and 3 years’ corrected age 
(Cardiff Acuity test) and 5 years (ETDRS visual acuity test), refraction in each eye and visual function 
as per a vision function form (qualitative assessment) at a supplemental visit to capture visual function 
and peripheral vision at the patient’s fifth birthday.  In addition, in response to the RSI, the MAH 
submitted a supplementary interim analysis containing additional results of vision function outcomes 
and safety from the ongoing H2301E1 study that have become available. The data is too limited to 
draw firm conclusions, but there are no indications of a negative effect on visual function. 
The study design and the criteria for re-treatment of unresponsive patients do not allow to draw firm 
conclusions on the effect of re-treatment and on the best strategy to follow.  However, the majority of 
patients needed no more than one injection in each eye.  
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the core study 76 patients (34.9 %) experienced ocular AEs, the most commonly reported 
ocular AEs was retinal haemorrhage, followed by conjunctival haemorrhage, conjunctivitis, and ROP. 
The reported events in ranibizumab group vs laser were: Conjunctival haemorrhage (8.2% n=6 vs 
2.9% n=2); Retinal haemorrhage (13.2% n=10 vs 10.1% n=7); Conjunctivitis (7.9% n=6 vs 4.3% 
n=3).   
The risk of infectious endophthalmitis remains an identified risk for the adult indications. One case of 
endophthalmitis (serious) was reported in Core Study in the 0.1 mg ranibizumab dose group only.    
The most frequently reported ocular AEs in the extension phase were strabismus (4 patients) and 
conjunctivitis (4 patients). Serious ocular AEs was only reported in the 0.1 mg dose group, in 4 
patients, including ROP (n=1); Serious retinal detachment (n=1) and Nystagmus (n=1). In the laser 
group one case of ROP was reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019  
Page 96/101 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequent ocular AEs reported in the interim analysis were strabismus (n=3, n=5, n=3 in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively) and conjunctivitis (n=2 in 
the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively). 
Three serious ocular AE was reported in the 0.1 mg ranibizumab group (retinal detachment, 
retinopathy of prematurity, nystagmus).  
Most frequent non-ocular AEs were bronchitis (0%, 4.6% and 9.3% of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg and 0.1 mg groups and the laser group, respectively) and pneumonia (3.3%, 1.5% and 5.6%, 
respectively). 
In summary, no clinically significant differences were observed for ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs 
across the treatment groups.  
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
.  
The initially submitted efficacy and safety data covers a total study period of 40 weeks and included 
infants who were on average 26 gestational weeks of age at inclusion. During the review round, long 
term safety data from an interim analysis with a cut-off 6 Feb 2019 was submitted, including 177 
patients followed-up for more than 18 months, among them 125 patients followed-up for more than 
two years.  
The additional safety data and growth data provided did not indicate any detrimental effects up to 
three years. 
A somewhat higher reporting rate of adverse events was noted in the Core Study, in either 
ranibizumab group compared to laser group (ranibizumab vs laser) related to cardiovascular events 
(bradycardia 6.6% vs 1.4%) and respiratory events (upper respiratory tract infection 8.2% vs 1.4%).. 
The plasma analysis showed ranibizumab concentrations considerably higher (10-15 times) compared 
to adult levels. However, this is considered to be of low concern considering that the majority of 
patients need only one injection.

6.7.  Benefit–risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the treatment of Type 1 ROP, laser photocoagulation is currently the treatment of choice. However, 
it may in some cases be associated with ocular complications and the risks derived from sedation or 
general anaesthesia. It is also a time and technical-demanding procedure. Ranibizumab may be a less 
destructive treatment and can be administered directly to the vitreous without requiring sedation or 
anaesthesia.  
The medicinal product should be administered to preterm infants with the new low-volume, high-
accuracy syringe specifically referred to in the SmPC.  
Results from Study H2301 showed higher rates of treatment success (absence of active ROP and 
unfavourable structural outcomes) for ranibizumab compared with laser therapy up to 24 weeks after 
treatment initiation. The majority of patients received only one initial bilateral ranibizumab treatment 
(i.e., 2 injections, one in each eye), 78.1 % in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group and 77.6 % in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg group. No eye required more than 3 injections (as per protocol). Late recurrence 
beyond 40 weeks after initial treatment was not observed. 
No detrimental effects in vision function with ranibizumab treatment were identified in limited follow-up 
data from a supplementary analysis that included visual reception of Mullen scale of early learning, 
CAT at two years of corrected age, and vision function rating (VA and peripheral vision, respectively) at 
a supplementary visit. However, the provided data concerned only few patients and are insufficient to 
draw conclusions on long-term benefit in terms of visual outcome. More data will be submitted post 
approval. 
The plasma analysis showed ranibizumab concentrations considerably higher (10-15 times) compared 
to adult levels, however, levels of VEGF were at the same level regardless of treatment (ranibizumab 
or laser).. A PK/PD analysis conducted by the MAH showed no clear relationship between systemic 
ranibizumab concentrations and systemic VEGF concentrations. Thus, the overall relevance of the 
relatively higher systemic ranibizumab exposure in premature infants for safety is currently unknown. 
However, it could be considered as somewhat reassuring that the vast majority of the patients in the 
study needed only one initial bilateral ranibizumab treatment (i.e., 2 injections, one in each eye).  
The available short-term safety data showed that the most commonly reported ocular AEs were retinal 
haemorrhage, conjunctival haemorrhage and conjunctivitis, which is consistent with the known safety 
profile of ranibizumab. The non-ocular events (respiratory events and infections) were mainly related 
to the comorbidity of the population and medical history and no clinically relevant difference compared 
to laser was observed.   
With respect to long-term safety, the MAH has submitted data from an interim analysis with a cut-off 6 
Feb 2019, including 177 patients followed-up for more than 18 months, among them 125 patients 
followed-up for more than two years. These additional safety data do not raise any new issues; 
however, the intended patient population is particularly vulnerable and long-term follow-up data are 
limited.  
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results from the single pivotal study H2301 for ranibizumab showed higher treatment success rates 
(absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes) as compared with laser up to 24 weeks 
after initial treatment and fewer patients had unfavourable structural outcomes at or before Week 24. 
No patient in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group received re-treatment in the Extension Study H2301E1, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406682/2019

indicating no recurrence after 40weeks post baseline treatment with ranibizumab 0.2 mg. The safety 
data available to date is in general in agreement with the known safety profile of ranibizumab in adults 
and with the comorbidity of the preterm population and do not raise new concerns. However, the data 
on long term efficacy and safety is still limited.  
The beneficial effects are considered to outweigh the risks. 
6.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The initially proposed indication (treatment of ROP in premature infants) was broader compared with 
the study population, which included patients with bilateral ROP with one of the following retinal 
findings in each eye: Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or AP-ROP 
(aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity). The MAH was requested to justify and explain why 
the benefit/risk balance would be positive also in subgroups not studied or propose a restricted target 
population. 
In response, the MAH revised the proposed indicated population which now reflects the study 
population, including only patients with bilateral ROP with one of the following retinal findings in each 
eye: Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or AP-ROP (aggressive 
posterior retinopathy of prematurity). 
This revised indication is more consistent with treatment recommendations in current literature. 
According to a recent guideline for screening examination of premature infants with ROP (Fierson, et 
al, Dec 2018), treatment should be initiated for Zone I ROP (any stage with plus disease); Zone I ROP 
stage 3 (no plus disease); as well as Zone II (stage 2 or 3 with plus disease).  
As the revised indication reflects clinical practice guidelines and the population studied in H2301 and 
given that the benefit-risk observed in this population appears to be favourable at the current stage, 
this revised indication seems to be appropriate.  
Most patients have received a single injection per eye without the need for retreatment. As no patient 
in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group was re-treated beyond Week 24, the MAH has proposed a more 
structured SmPC statement concerning frequency and duration of treatment, using a limit of up to 3 
injections per eye to be administered within 6 months. This is considered acceptable.  
A primary objective of the H2301 extension study is visual acuity at the patient's 5th birthday, using 
the Lea symbols chart. In addition to visual acuity to be assessed at 5 years of age, a VA assessment 
using the Cardiff Acuity Test will be performed during the scheduled Year 2 and Year 3 visits. In 
addition, a Vision Function Form (VFF) will be used to collect qualitative data on VA and peripheral 
vision at a supplementary visit as part of standard clinical practice. Cognitive status including visual 
reception using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning will be assessed at 2 and 5 years of age. To reduce 
possible bias, the MAH has agreed to an additional protocol amendment for Study H2301E1 to require 
the person performing the visual outcome assessments at Year 5 to be blinded to the assigned 
treatment allocation in the core study.  
The second predefined interim analysis (IA2) of the study is planned after the last patient has 
completed the visit at the corrected age of two years. The purpose of the IA2 is to evaluate the 
absence of any ocular structural abnormalities, as well as visual acuity, safety and cognitive outcomes. 
The IA2 results are planned to be available in Q2 2020. The final study report is expected in Q2 2023.  
Regarding the subsequent submissions, the MAH initially proposed to provide the results of IA2 as a 
post approval commitment. RMP v18.1 submitted in response to the RSI has been updated accordingly 
and includes IA2 of the ongoing Study H2301E1 as a Category 3 milestone commitment (planned 
Assessment report

Page 100/101 
 
 
 
submission 31 March 2020). This is in addition to the already included milestone for submission of the 
final report submission in Q2 2023.  
However, given that the initial efficacy assessment is based on surrogate endpoints, this would require 
verification of the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression or confirmation 
of previous efficacy assumptions. Accordingly, the MAH has agreed to the request that the results of 
the IA2 and the final report for H2301E1 be subject to a Category 1 commitment (Annex II D 
condition) as a PAES, interventional, with a due date 30 June 2023, and including other relevant 
milestones including IA2 (due date 30 June 2020). This is endorsed. In addition, the remaining other 
concerns including remaining comments to the product information have now been adequately 
addressed.

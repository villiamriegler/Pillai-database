CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Ximluci is indicated in adults for:




The treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
The treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME)
The treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)
The treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion 
(branch RVO or central RVO)
The treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV)

4.2
Posology and method of administration
Ximluci must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections.
Posology
Adults
The recommended dose for Ximluci in adults is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 mL. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks.
Treatment in adults is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved 
and/or there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and 
symptoms of the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, 
initially, three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed.
2
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters.
If, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomic parameters indicate that the patient is not benefiting 
from continued treatment, Ximluci should be discontinued.
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography).
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly.
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year (see section 
5.1).
Ximluci and laser photocoagulation in DME and in macular oedema secondary to BRVO
There is some experience of ranibizumab administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation (see 
section 5.1). When given on the same day, Ximluci should be administered at least 30 minutes after 
laser photocoagulation. Ximluci can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation.
Ximluci and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM
There is no experience of concomitant administration of ranibizumab and verteporfin.
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. There is limited experience in patients older than 
75 years with DME.
Renal impairment
Dose adjustment is not needed in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Ranibizumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. However, no special 
considerations are needed in this population.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Ximluci in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. Available data in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with visual impairment due to 
CNV are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.
Method of administration
Single-use vial for intravitreal use only.
Since the volume contained in the vial (0.23 mL) is greater than the recommended dose (0.05 mL for 
adults), a portion of the volume contained in the vial must be discarded prior to administration.
3
Ximluci should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure 
(see section 4.4). Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the 
periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance 
with local practice.
Adults
In adults, the injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous 
cavity, avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection 
volume of 0.05 mL is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections.
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections.
Patients with active severe intraocular inflammation.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded
Intravitreal injection-related reactions
Intravitreous injections, including those with ranibizumab, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic 
cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering 
Ximluci. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit 
early treatment if an infection occurs. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive 
of endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events without delay.
Intraocular pressure increases
In adults transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been seen within 60 minutes of 
injection of ranibizumab. Sustained IOP increases have also been identified (see section 4.8). Both 
intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must be monitored and managed 
appropriately.
Patients should be informed of the symptoms of these potential adverse reactions and instructed to 
inform their physician if they develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in their vision, or 
increased sensitivity to light (see section 4.8).
Bilateral treatment
Limited data on bilateral use of ranibizumab (including same-day administration) do not suggest an 
increased risk of systemic adverse events compared with unilateral treatment.
4
Immunogenicity
There is a potential for immunogenicity with ranibizumab. Since there is a potential for an increased 
systemic exposure in subjects with DME, an increased risk for developing hypersensitivity in this 
patient population cannot be excluded. Patients should also be instructed to report if an intraocular 
inflammation increases in severity, which may be a clinical sign attributable to intraocular antibody 
formation.
Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)
Ximluci should not be administered concurrently with other anti-VEGF medicinal products (systemic 
or ocular).
Withholding Ximluci in adults
The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next scheduled 
treatment in the event of:

a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters compared with the last 
assessment of visual acuity;
an intraocular pressure of ≥30 mmHg;
a retinal break;
a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the haemorrhage is 
≥50%, of the total lesion area;
performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days.




Retinal pigment epithelial tear
Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-VEGF 
therapy for wet AMD and potentially also other forms of CNV, include a large and/or high pigment 
epithelial retinal detachment. When initiating ranibizumab therapy, caution should be used in patients 
with these risk factors for retinal pigment epithelial tears.
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular holes in adults
Treatment should be discontinued in subjects with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or 4 
macular holes.
Populations with limited data
There is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes. 
Ranibizumab has not been studied in patients who have previously received intravitreal injections, in 
patients with active systemic infections, or in patients with concurrent eye conditions such as retinal 
detachment or macular hole. There is limited experience of treatment with ranibizumab in diabetic 
patients with an HbA1c over 108 mmol/mol (12%) and no experience in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension. This lack of information should be considered by the physician when treating such 
patients.
There are insufficient data to conclude on the effect of ranibizumab in patients with RVO presenting 
irreversible ischaemic visual function loss.
In patients with PM, there are limited data on the effect of ranibizumab in patients who have 
previously undergone unsuccessful verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) treatment. Also, while a 
consistent effect was observed in subjects with subfoveal and juxtafoveal lesions, there are insufficient 
data to conclude on the effect of ranibizumab in PM subjects with extrafoveal lesions.
Systemic effects following intravitreal use
5
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors.
There are limited data on safety in the treatment of DME, macular oedema due to RVO and CNV 
secondary to PM patients with prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Caution should be 
exercised when treating such patients (see section 4.8).
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
For the adjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Ximluci in wet AMD and PM, 
see section 5.1.
For the adjunctive use of laser photocoagulation and Ximluci in DME and BRVO, see sections 4.2 and 
5.1.
In clinical studies for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME, the outcome with regard to 
visual acuity or central retinal subfield thickness (CSFT) in patients treated with ranibizumab was not 
affected by concomitant treatment with thiazolidinediones.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment.
Pregnancy
For ranibizumab no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or 
embryonal/foetal development (see section 5.3). The systemic exposure to ranibizumab is low after 
ocular administration, but due to its mechanism of action, ranibizumab must be regarded as potentially 
teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic. Therefore, ranibizumab should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. For women who wish to become 
pregnant and have been treated with ranibizumab, it is recommended to wait at least 3 months after the 
last dose of ranibizumab before conceiving a child.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether ranibizumab is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended 
during the use of Ximluci.
Fertility
There are no data available on fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The treatment procedure may induce temporary visual disturbances, which may affect the ability to 
drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients who experience these signs must not drive or use 
machines until these temporary visual disturbances subside.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
6
The majority of adverse reactions reported following administration of ranibizumab are related to the 
intravitreal injection procedure.
The most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions following injection of ranibizumab are: eye 
pain, ocular hyperaemia, increased intraocular pressure, vitritis, vitreous detachment, retinal 
haemorrhage, visual disturbance, vitreous floaters, conjunctival haemorrhage, eye irritation, foreign 
body sensation in eyes, increased lacrimation, blepharitis, dry eye and eye pruritus.
The most frequently reported non-ocular adverse reactions are headache, nasopharyngitis and 
arthralgia.
Less frequently reported, but more serious, adverse reactions include endophthalmitis, blindness, 
retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic cataract (see section 4.4).
The adverse reactions experienced following administration of ranibizumab in clinical trials are

# Adverse reactions were defined as adverse events (in at least 0.5 percentage points of patients) which 
occurred at a higher rate (at least 2 percentage points) in patients receiving treatment with 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg than in those receiving control treatment (sham or verteporfin PDT).
* observed only in DME population
Product-class-related adverse reactions
In the wet AMD phase III studies, the overall frequency of non-ocular haemorrhages, an adverse event 
potentially related to systemic VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibition, was slightly 
increased in ranibizumab-treated patients. However, there was no consistent pattern among the 
different haemorrhages. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke 
and myocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of 
arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials in patients with AMD, 
DME, PDR, RVO and CNV and there were no major differences between the groups treated with 
ranibizumab compared to control.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Cases of accidental overdose have been reported from the clinical studies in wet AMD and 
postmarketing data. Adverse reactions associated with these reported cases were intraocular pressure 
increased, transient blindness, reduced visual acuity, corneal oedema, corneal pain, and eye pain. If an 
overdose occurs, intraocular pressure should be monitored and treated, if deemed necessary by the 
attending physician.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
9
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA04
Ximluci is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.
Mechanism of action
Ranibizumab is a humanised recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It binds with high affinity to the VEGF-A isoforms
(e.g. VEGF110, VEGF121 and VEGF165), thereby preventing binding of VEGF-A to its receptors 
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Binding of VEGF-A to its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation 
and neovascularisation, as well as vascular leakage, all of which are thought to contribute to the 
progression of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia and CNV 
or to visual impairment caused by either diabetic macular oedema or macular oedema secondary to 
RVO in adults.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Treatment of wet AMD
In wet AMD, the clinical safety and efficacy of ranibizumab have been assessed in three randomised, 
double-masked, sham- or active-controlled studies of 24 months duration in patients with neovascular 
AMD. A total of 1,323 patients (879 active and 444 control) were enrolled in these studies.
In study FVF2598g (MARINA), 716 patients with minimally classic or occult with no classic lesions 
were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive monthly injections of ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 
0.5 mg or sham.
In study FVF2587g (ANCHOR), 423 patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions were 
randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive ranibizumab 0.3 mg monthly, ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly or 
verteporfin PDT (at baseline and every 3 months thereafter if fluorescein angiography showed 
persistence or recurrence of vascular leakage).
Key outcome measures are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Figure 1 Mean change in visual acuity from baseline to Month 24 in study FVF2598g 
(MARINA) and study FVF2587g (ANCHOR)
Results from both trials indicated that continued ranibizumab treatment may also be of benefit in 
patients who lost ≥15 letters of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the first year of treatment.
Statistically significant patient-reported visual functioning benefits were observed in both MARINA 
and ANCHOR with ranibizumab treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25.
In study FVF3192g (PIER), 184 patients with all forms of neovascular AMD were randomised in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg or sham injections once a month for 3 
consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months. From Month 14 of the
study, sham-treated patients were allowed to receive ranibizumab and from Month 19, more frequent 
treatments were possible. Patients treated with ranibizumab in PIER received a mean of 10 total 
treatments.
After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients’ visual acuity 
declined with quarterly dosing, returning to baseline at Month 12 and this effect was maintained in 
most ranibizumab-treated patients (82%) at Month 24. Limited data from sham subjects who later 
received ranibizumab suggested that early initiation of treatment may be associated with better 
preservation of visual acuity.
11
Data from two studies (MONT BLANC, BPD952A2308 and DENALI, BPD952A2309) conducted 
post approval confirmed the efficacy of ranibizumab but did not demonstrate additional effect of the 
combined administration of verteporfin (Visudyne PDT) and ranibizumab compared to ranibizumab 
monotherapy.
Treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM
The clinical safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment due to CNV in PM 
have been assessed based on the 12-month data of the double-masked, controlled pivotal study F2301 
(RADIANCE). In this study 277 patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to the following arms:

Group I (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, dosing regimen driven by “stability” criteria defined as no change 
in BCVA compared to two preceding monthly evaluations).
Group II (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, dosing regimen driven by “disease activity” criteria defined as 
vision impairment attributable to intra- or subretinal fluid or active leakage due to the CNV 
lesion as assessed by optical coherence tomography and/or fluorescence angiography).
Group III (vPDT - patients were allowed to receive ranibizumab treatment as of Month 3).

In Group II, which is the recommended posology (see section 4.2), 50.9% of patients required 1 or 2 
injections, 34.5% required 3 to 5 injections and 14.7% required 6 to 12 injections over the 12-month 
study period. 62.9% of Group II patients did not require injections in the second 6 months of the study.

The improvement of vision was accompanied by a reduction in central retinal thickness.
Patient-reported benefits were observed with ranibizumab treatment arms over vPDT (p-value <0.05) 
in terms of improvement in the composite score and several subscales (general vision, near activities, 
mental health and dependency) of the NEI VFQ-25.
Treatment of visual impairment due to CNV (other than secondary to PM and wet AMD)
The clinical safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment due to CNV have 
been assessed based on the 12-month data of the double-masked, sham-controlled pivotal study G2301 
(MINERVA). In this study 178 adult patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive:

ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline, followed by an individualised dosing regimen driven by disease 
activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters (e.g. VA impairment, 
intra/sub-retinal fluid, haemorrhage or leakage);
sham injection at baseline, followed by an individualised treatment regimen driven by disease 
activity.

At Month 2, all patients received open-label treatment with ranibizumab as needed.
Key outcome measures from MINERVA are summarised in Table 3 and Figure 3. An improvement of 
vision was observed and was accompanied by a reduction in central subfield thickness over the 
12-month period.
The mean number of injections given over 12 months was 5.8 in the ranibizumab arm versus 5.4 in 
those patients in the sham arm who were eligible to receive ranibizumab from Month 2 onwards. In 
the sham arm 7 out of 59 patients did not receive any treatment with ranibizumab in the study eye 
during the 12-month period.

In the pivotal study G2301 (MINERVA), five adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with visual 
impairment secondary to CNV received open-label treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline 
followed by an individualised treatment regimen as for the adult population. BCVA improved from 
baseline to Month 12 in all five patients, ranging from 5 to 38 letters (mean of 16.6 letters). The 
improvement of vision was accompanied by a stabilisation or reduction in central subfield thickness 
over the 12-month period. The mean number of ranibizumab injections given in the study eye over 
12 months was 3 (ranged from 2 to 5). Overall, ranibizumab treatment was well tolerated.
Treatment of visual impairment due to DME
The efficacy and safety of ranibizumab have been assessed in three randomised, controlled studies of 
at least 12 months duration. A total of 868 patients (708 active and 160 control) were enrolled in these 
studies.
In the phase II study D2201 (RESOLVE), 151 patients were treated with ranibizumab (6 mg/mL, 
n=51, 10 mg/mL, n=51) or sham (n=49) by monthly intravitreal injections. The mean average change 
in BCVA from Month 1 to Month 12 compared to baseline was +7.8 (±7.72) letters in the pooled 
ranibizumab-treated patients (n=102), compared to -0.1 (±9.77) letters for sham-treated patients; and 
the mean change in BCVA at Month 12 from baseline was 10.3 (±9.1) letters compared to -1.4 (±14.2) 
letters, respectively (p<0.0001 for the treatment difference).
In the phase III study D2301 (RESTORE), 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy and sham laser photocoagulation, combined ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
and laser photocoagulation or sham injection and laser photocoagulation. 240 patients, who had 
previously completed the 12-month RESTORE study, were enrolled in the open-label, multicentre 
24-month extension (RESTORE Extension) study. Patients were treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg pro 
re nata (PRN) in the same eye as the core study (D2301 RESTORE).
Key outcome measures are summarised in Table 5 (RESTORE and Extension) and Figure 4 
(RESTORE).

The effect at 12 months was consistent in most subgroups. However, subjects with a baseline BCVA 
>73 letters and macular oedema with central retinal thickness <300 µm did not appear to benefit from 
treatment with ranibizumab compared to laser photocoagulation.

Statistically significant patient-reported benefits for most vision-related functions were observed with 
ranibizumab (with or without laser) treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25.
For other subscales of this questionnaire no treatment differences could be established.
The long-term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 24-month extension study is consistent 
with the known ranibizumab safety profile.
In the phase IIIb study D2304 (RETAIN), 372 patients were randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to receive:

ranibizumab 0.5 mg with concomitant laser photocoagulation on a treat-and-extend (TE) 
regimen,
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy on a TE regimen,
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy on a PRN regimen.


In all groups, ranibizumab was administered monthly until BCVA was stable for at least three 
consecutive monthly assessments. On TE, ranibizumab was administered at treatment intervals of 
16
2-3 months. In all groups, monthly treatment was re-initiated upon a decrease in BCVA due to DME 
progression and continued until stable BCVA was reached again.
The number of scheduled treatment visits after the initial 3 injections, was 13 and 20 for the TE and 
PRN regimens, respectively. With both TE regimens, more than 70% of patients maintained their 
BCVA with an average visit frequency of ≥2 months.
The key outcome measures are summarised in Table 6.

In DME studies, the improvement in BCVA was accompanied by a reduction over time in mean CSFT 
in all the treatment groups.
Treatment of PDR
The clinical safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with PDR have been assessed in Protocol S 
which evaluated the treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections compared with 
panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). The primary endpoint was the mean visual acuity change at year 2. 
Additionally, change in diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was assessed based on fundus photographs 
using the DR severity score (DRSS).
Protocol S was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-assignment, non-inferiority phase 
III study in which 305 patients (394 study eyes) with PDR with or without DME at baseline were 
enrolled. The study compared ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections to standard treatment with 
PRP. A total of 191 eyes (48.5%) were randomised to ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 203 eyes (51.5%) eyes 
were randomised to PRP. A total of 88 eyes (22.3%) had baseline DME: 42 (22.0%) and 46 (22.7%) 
eyes in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively.
In this study, the mean visual acuity change at year 2 was +2.7 letters in the ranibizumab group 
compared to -0.7 letters in the PRP group. The difference in least square means was 3.5 letters (95% 
CI: [0.2 to 6.7]).
At year 1, 41.8% of eyes experienced a ≥2-step improvement in the DRSS when treated with 
ranibizumab (n=189) compared to 14.6% of eyes treated with PRP (n=199). The estimated difference 
between ranibizumab and laser was 27.4% (95% CI: [18.9, 35.9]).

At year 1 in the ranibizumab-treated group in Protocol S, ≥2-step improvement in DRSS was 
consistent in eyes without DME (39.9%) and with baseline DME (48.8%).
An analysis of year 2 data from Protocol S demonstrated that 42.3% (n=80) of eyes in the 
ranibizumab-treated group had ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline compared with 23.1% 
(n=46) of eyes in the PRP group. In the ranibizumab-treated group, ≥2-step improvement in DRSS 
from baseline was observed in 58.5% (n=24) of eyes with baseline DME and 37.8% (n=56) of eyes 
without DME.
DRSS was also assessed in three separate active-controlled phase III DME studies (ranibizumab 
0.5 mg PRN vs laser) that included a total of 875 patients, of whom approximately 75% were of Asian 
origin. In a meta-analysis of these studies, 48.4% of the 315 patients with gradable DRSS scores in the 
subgroup of patients with moderately severe non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or worse at baseline 
experienced a ≥2-step improvement in the DRSS at Month 12 when treated with ranibizumab (n=192) 
vs 14.6% of patients treated with laser (n=123). The estimated difference between ranibizumab and 
laser was 29.9% (95% CI: [20.0, 39.7]). In the 405 DRSS gradable patients with moderate NPDR or 
better, a ≥2-step DRSS improvement was observed in 1.4% and 0.9% of the ranibizumab and laser 
groups, respectively.
Treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO
The clinical safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment due to macular 
oedema secondary to RVO have been assessed in the randomised, double-masked, controlled studies 
BRAVO and CRUISE that recruited subjects with BRVO (n=397) and CRVO (n=392), respectively. 
In both studies, subjects received either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab or sham injections. After 
6 months, patients in the sham-control arms switched to 0.5 mg ranibizumab.
Key outcome measures from BRAVO and CRUISE are summarised in Table 8 and Figures 5 and 6.

In both studies, the improvement of vision was accompanied by a continuous and significant reduction 
in the macular oedema as measured by central retinal thickness.
In patients with CRVO (CRUISE and extension study HORIZON): Subjects treated with sham in the 
first 6 months who subsequently received ranibizumab did not achieve comparable gains in VA by 
Month 24 (~6 letters) compared to subjects treated with ranibizumab from study start (~12 letters).
Statistically significant patient-reported benefits in subscales related to near and distance activity were 
observed with ranibizumab treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25.
The long-term (24 months) clinical safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with visual 
impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO were assessed in the BRIGHTER (BRVO) and 
CRYSTAL (CRVO) studies. In both studies, subjects received a 0.5 mg ranibizumab PRN dosing 
regimen driven by individualised stabilisation criteria. BRIGHTER was a 3-arm randomised active-
controlled study that compared 0.5 mg ranibizumab given as monotherapy or in combination with 
adjunctive laser photocoagulation to laser photocoagulation alone. After 6 months, subjects in the laser 
arm could receive 0.5 mg ranibizumab. CRYSTAL was a single-arm study with 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
monotherapy.
Key outcome measures from BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL are shown in Table 9.

b p<0.0001for null hypothesis in CRYSTAL that the mean change at Month 24 from baseline is zero.
* Starting at Month 6 ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment was allowed (24 patients were treated with laser 
only).
In BRIGHTER, ranibizumab 0.5 mg with adjunctive laser therapy demonstrated non-inferiority versus 
ranibizumab monotherapy from baseline to Month 24 (95% CI -2.8, 1.4).
In both studies, a rapid and statistically significant decrease from baseline in central retinal subfield 
thickness was observed at Month 1. This effect was maintained up to Month 24.
The effect of ranibizumab treatment was similar irrespective of the presence of retinal ischaemia. In 
BRIGHTER, patients with ischaemia present (N=46) or absent (N=133) and treated with ranibizumab 
monotherapy had a mean change from baseline of +15.3 and +15.6 letters, respectively, at Month 24. 
In CRYSTAL, patients with ischaemia present (N=53) or absent (N=300) and treated with 
ranibizumab monotherapy had a mean change from baseline of +15.0 and +11.5 letters, respectively.
The effect in terms of visual improvement was observed in all patients treated with 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab monotherapy regardless of their disease duration in both BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL. In 
patients with <3 months disease duration an increase in visual acuity of 13.3 and 10.0 letters was seen 
at Month 1; and 17.7 and 13.2 letters at Month 24 in BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL, respectively. The 
corresponding visual acuity gain in patients with ≥12 months disease duration was 8.6 and 8.4 letters 
in the respective studies. Treatment initiation at the time of diagnosis should be considered.
The long-term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 24-month studies is consistent with the 
known ranibizumab safety profile.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing ranibizumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
neovascular AMD, visual impairment due to DME, visual impairment due to macular oedema 
secondary to RVO, visual impairment due to CNV and diabetic retinopathy (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Following monthly intravitreal administration of ranibizumab to patients with neovascular AMD, 
serum concentrations of ranibizumab were generally low, with maximum levels (Cmax) generally 
21
below the ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 50% 
(11-27 ng/mL, as assessed in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay). Cmax was dose proportional over 
the dose range of 0.05 to 1.0 mg/eye. Serum concentrations in a limited number of DME patients 
indicate that a slightly higher systemic exposure cannot be excluded compared to those observed in 
neovascular AMD patients. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO patients were similar or 
slightly higher compared to those observed in neovascular AMD patients.
Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics and disappearance of ranibizumab from serum for 
patients with neovascular AMD treated with the 0.5 mg dose, the average vitreous elimination half-life 
of ranibizumab is approximately 9 days. Upon monthly intravitreal administration of ranibizumab 
0.5 mg/eye, serum ranibizumab Cmax, attained approximately 1 day after dosing, is predicted to 
generally range between 0.79 and 2.90 ng/mL, and Cmin is predicted to generally range between 
0.07 and 0.49 ng/mL. Serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 
90,000-fold lower than vitreal ranibizumab concentrations.
Renal impairment
No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab in patients 
with renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of neovascular AMD patients, 68% 
(136 of 200) of patients had renal impairment (46.5% mild [50-80 mL/min], 20% moderate 
[30-50 mL/min], and 1.5% severe [<30 mL/min]). In RVO patients, 48.2% (253 of 525) had renal 
impairment (36.4% mild, 9.5% moderate and 2.3% severe). Systemic clearance was slightly lower, but 
this was not clinically significant.
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab in patients 
with hepatic impairment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Bilateral intravitreal administration of ranibizumab to cynomolgus monkeys at doses between 
0.25 mg/eye and 2.0 mg/eye once every 2 weeks for up to 26 weeks resulted in dose-dependent ocular 
effects.
Intraocularly, there were dose-dependent increases in anterior chamber flare and cells with a peak 
2 days after injection. The severity of the inflammatory response generally diminished with 
subsequent injections or during recovery. In the posterior segment, there were vitreal cell infiltration 
and floaters, which also tended to be dose-dependent and generally persisted to the end of the 
treatment period. In the 26-week study, the severity of the vitreous inflammation increased with the 
number of injections. However, evidence of reversibility was observed after recovery. The nature and 
timing of the posterior segment inflammation is suggestive of an immune-mediated antibody response, 
which may be clinically irrelevant. Cataract formation was observed in some animals after a relatively 
long period of intense inflammation, suggesting that the lens changes were secondary to severe 
inflammation. A transient increase in post-dose intraocular pressure was observed following 
intravitreal injections, irrespective of dose.
Microscopic ocular changes were related to inflammation and did not indicate degenerative processes. 
Granulomatous inflammatory changes were noted in the optic disc of some eyes. These posterior 
segment changes diminished, and in some instances resolved, during the recovery period.
Following intravitreal administration, no signs of systemic toxicity were detected. Serum and vitreous 
antibodies to ranibizumab were found in a subset of treated animals.
No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity data are available.
22
In pregnant monkeys, intravitreal ranibizumab treatment resulting in maximal systemic exposures 
0.9-7-fold a worst case clinical exposure did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity, and 
had no effect on weight or structure of the placenta, although, based on its pharmacological effect 
ranibizumab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic.
The absence of ranibizumab-mediated effects on embryo-foetal development is plausibly related 
mainly to the inability of the Fab fragment to cross the placenta. Nevertheless, a case was described 
with high maternal ranibizumab serum levels and presence of ranibizumab in foetal serum, suggesting 
that the anti-ranibizumab antibody acted as (Fc region containing) carrier protein for ranibizumab, 
thereby decreasing its maternal serum clearance and enabling its placental transfer. As the 
embryofoetal development investigations were performed in healthy pregnant animals and disease 
(such as diabetes) may modify the permeability of the placenta towards a Fab fragment, the study 
should be interpreted with caution.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Ximluci is and what it is used for
What Ximluci is
Ximluci is a solution which is injected into the eye. Ximluci belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab.
What Ximluci is used for
Ximluci is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment.
These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by:
Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 

macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV.
Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)).

How Ximluci works
Ximluci specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and 
swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD, DME, PDR, RVO, 
PM and CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Ximluci can block its actions and prevent this abnormal 
growth and swelling.
In these diseases, Ximluci can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision.

2. What you need to know before you are given Ximluci
You must not receive Ximluci

If you are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
If you have an infection in or around your eye.
If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before you are given Ximluci.

Ximluci is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion of 
the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Ximluci treatment. It is important to identify and 
treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor 
immediately if you develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or 
increased sensitivity to light.
In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection.
Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Ximluci is the appropriate treatment for you.
Please see section 4 (“Possible side effects”) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Ximluci therapy.
Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age)
The use of Ximluci in children and adolescents has not been established and is therefore not 
recommended.
Other medicines and Ximluci
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least three further months after the last injection of Ximluci.
There is no experience of using Ximluci in pregnant women. Ximluci should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you 
are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your 
doctor before treatment with Ximluci.
Ximluci is not recommended during breast-feeding because it is not known whether Ximluci 
passes into human milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before Ximluci treatment.
Driving and using machines
After Ximluci treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do not 
drive or use machines until this resolves.
3.
How Ximluci is given
Ximluci is administered as a single injection into your eye by your eye doctor under a local 
anaesthetic. The usual dose of an injection is 0.05 mL (which contains 0.5 mg of active substance). 
39
The interval between two doses injected into the same eye should be at least four weeks. All injections 
will be administered by your eye doctor.
Before the injection, your doctor will wash your eye carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection.
The treatment is started with one injection of Ximluci per month. Your doctor will monitor the 
condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if and when 
you need to receive further treatment.
Detailed instructions for use are given at the end of the leaflet under “How to prepare and administer 
Ximluci to adults”.
Elderly (age 65 years and over)
Ximluci can be used for people of 65 years of age and over without dose adjustment.
Before stopping Ximluci treatment
If you are considering stopping Ximluci treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss this 
with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with 
Ximluci.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY:
Please also refer to section 3 “How Ximluci is given”.
How to prepare and administer Ximluci to adults
Single-use vial for intravitreal use only.
Ximluci must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections.
In wet AMD, in CNV, in PDR and in visual impairment due to DME or to macular oedema secondary 
to RVO the recommended dose for Ximluci is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 mL. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks.
Treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or 
there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and symptoms of 
the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, initially, 
three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed.
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters.
If, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomical parameters indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, Ximluci should be discontinued.
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography).
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly.
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year.
Ximluci and laser photocoagulation in DME and macular oedema secondary to BRVO
There is some experience of Ximluci administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation. When 
given on the same day, Ximluci should be administered at least 30 minutes after laser 
photocoagulation. Ximluci can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation.
Ximluci and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM
44
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Ximluci and verteporfin.
Ximluci should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure. 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance with local practice.
Vial-only pack
The vial is for single use only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Any vial 
showing signs of damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the 
packaging seal remains intact.
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed:
a sterile 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 1.2 mm x 40 mm)

a 1 mL sterile syringe (including a 0.05 mL mark)

an injection needle (30G x ½″, 0.3 mm x 13 mm).

These medical devices are not included within the Ximluci pack.
Vial + filter needle pack
All components are sterile and for single use only. Any component with packaging showing signs of 
damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the component 
packaging seal remains intact. Re-use may lead to infection or other illness/injury.
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed:



a sterile 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 1.2 mm x 40 mm, provided)
a 1 mL sterile syringe (including a 0.05 mL mark, not included within the Ximluci pack)
an injection needle (30G x ½″, 0.3 mm x 13 mm; not included within the Ximluci pack)
To prepare Ximluci for intravitreal administration to adult patients, please adhere to the following 
instructions:
1.
2.
Before withdrawal, remove the vial cap and clean the vial 
septum (e.g. with 70% alcohol swab).
Assemble a 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 1.2 mm x 
40 mm) onto a 1 mL syringe using aseptic technique. Push 
the blunt filter needle into the centre of the vial stopper until 
the needle touches the bottom edge of the vial.
3. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in an 
upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete 
withdrawal.
4.
5.
Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when 
emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter
needle.
Leave the blunt filter needle in the vial and disconnect the 
syringe from the blunt filter needle. The filter needle should 
be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and should 
not be used for the intravitreal injection.
45
6.
7.
Aseptically and firmly assemble 
an injection needle (30G x ½″, 
0.3 mm x 13 mm) onto the 
syringe.
Carefully remove the cap from 
the injection needle without 
disconnecting the injection 
needle from the syringe.
Note: Grip at the hub of the 
injection needle while removing 
the cap.
8.
Carefully expel the air along with the excess solution from 
the syringe and adjust the dose to the 0.05 mL mark on the 
syringe. The syringe is ready for injection.
Note: Do not wipe the injection needle. Do not pull back on 
the plunger.
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5–4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 mL is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections.
After injection, do not recap the needle or detach it from the syringe. Dispose of the used syringe 
together with the needle in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements.

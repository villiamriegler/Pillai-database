2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application was submitted to provide the efficacy and safety results of the OUTCOMES study and to 
support the use of alirocumab for the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 5/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
established CV disease. 
The clinical OUTCOMES study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
to evaluate the effect of alirocumab on the occurrence of CV events in patients with established CV 
disease (CVD) and who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event within 4 to 52 weeks 
prior to randomization. This study aimed to investigate whether the addition of alirocumab to an 
optimized background lipid modifying therapy (LMT) regimen, including high intensity statin, provides an 
additional benefit, as compared to placebo, in further reducing the risk of CV events in patients who 
experienced an ACS event (within 4 to 52 weeks) and who, despite high intensity LMT, were not at 
prespecified lipid levels (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL [1.81 mmol/L], or apolipoprotein B [Apo B] ≥80 mg/dL [0.8 
g/L], or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL [2.59 mmol/L]). The 
OUTCOMES study also aimed to extensively evaluate the long-term safety of alirocumab up to 5 years. 
The intended wording of the extension of the indication at time of submission was: 
Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Established Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease 
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
unstable angina requiring hospitalization) and all-cause mortality by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct 
to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
•  alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
Request for an additional one year marketing protection  
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Marketing 
authorisation holder had applied for an additional one year marketing protection period in the framework 
of this application. 
The applicant subsequently withdrew their request. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Alirocumab is a protein derived from biotechnological processes. It is not expected to have an adverse 
effect on the environment. The Applicant has adequately justified the absence of studies to assess the 
environmental risk of alirocumab. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, this application does not lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of alirocumab. Considering the above, alirocumab 
is not expected to pose a risk to the environment

treatment or had discontinued treatment early) and should occur between Common Study End Date (CSED) and CSED+30days. 
ACS: acute coronary syndrome, LMT: lipid-modifying therapy, MTD: maximal tolerated dose
Figure 1: Study design - EFC11570 
Run-in period: The run-in period was to allow metabolic steady state after ACS and pharmacologic steady 
state on LMT to be achieved prior to randomization. Its duration ranged from 2 weeks to 16 weeks (+5 
days) prior to randomization with randomization occurring no earlier than 4 weeks and no later than 52 
weeks (+5 days) after the index ACS event. The run-in period was comprised of 2 visits, a screening visit 
(V1) and a qualifying visit (V2) based on the lipid criteria. 
•  The main goals of the run-in period were to ensure that the patient had received prior to the 
qualifying visit (V2) the required LMT regimen and that LMT was well tolerated after at least 2 
weeks of stable dose. The required LMT regimen could be statin-intensive (defined as atorvastatin 
40 or 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg daily) or maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of one of 
these 2 statins with addition of non-statin LMTs (at Investigator’s discretion), or in case of 
documented statin intolerance, an optimized regimen with non-statins LMT. 
•  Following the run-in period, only patients not reaching prespecified lipid levels at the qualifying 
visit (V2) after receiving optimal LMT for at least 2 weeks, ie, with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 
mmol/L), or apolipoprotein B (Apo B) ≥80 mg/dL (≥0.8 g/L), or non-high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (non-HDL-C) ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L), were to be randomized in the 
double-blind treatment period. 
Double-blind treatment period: At the randomization visit (V3), patients were randomized either to 
background LMT + alirocumab or to background LMT + placebo. Patients randomized to alirocumab 
initially received alirocumab 75 mg Q2W. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 8/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
•  Similar to the phase 3a studies conducted for the LDL-C lowering indication, after initiation of 
alirocumab 75 mg Q2W, an up-titration scheme in a blinded fashion was applied with possible 
up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at Month 2 depending on LDL-C values at Month 1 (based on an 
LDL-C ≥50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L)). Then, during the double-blind treatment period, subsequent 
down-titrations or switch to placebo could occur (see section treatments).   
•  Lipid parameter values from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit, run by the 
central laboratory, were not communicated to the sites so that they could not deduce the 
treatment group of any individual patient based on LDL-C levels. 
•  The planned total double-blind study duration was approximately 5 years for the first randomized 
patient. The common study end date (CSED) was defined as when 1613 patients had experienced 
at least one primary efficacy event or 24 months after the closing of randomization for all 
countries except China, whichever came last. 
The study employed the following committees: 
•  An Executive Steering Committee responsible for the good conduct of the study. 
•  An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (referred to as CV DMC) responsible for monitoring 
the patients’ safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated and unblinded safety data, and 
for supervising the planned 2 interim analyses.   
•  A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) responsible for adjudicating events corresponding to the 
primary and secondary CV endpoints as well as all causes of death. 
In addition, two experts panels were implemented in the study, a neurocognitive and a diabetes experts 
panel. 
Study participants 
Following the run-in period, only patients not reaching prespecified lipid levels at the qualifying visit after 
receiving optimal LMT for at least 2 weeks, ie, patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), or Apo B 
≥80 mg/dL (0.8 g/L), or non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) (at visit 2), were to be randomized in the 
double-blind treatment period.  
Inclusion criteria 
The population enrolled was patients with previous hospitalization for ACS, identified as either a 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), or a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction 
(NSTEMI), or a high-risk unstable angina (UA), and who were not at prespecified lipid levels (ie, either 
LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL [≥1.81 mmol/L], or ApoB ≥80 mg/dL [≥0.8 g/L], or non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL [≥2.59 
mmol/L]), despite an intensive LMT. 
The choice to select eligible patients on two other lipid parameters, in addition to the traditional LDL-C 
target lipid parameter, was based on the acceptance that ApoB and non-HDL-C can be considered to be 
equal to LDL-C in CV risk prediction. 
Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m² were allowed in the 
study. 
Exclusion criteria 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 9/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Exclusion criteria were mostly related to any condition or treatment that might interfere with efficacy 
assessment or were related to the patients’ underlying health status and especially unstable conditions 
that might interfere with the evaluation of efficacy and safety of alirocumab.  
The most relevant exclusion criteria are: 
• 
age <40 years. 
•  CV exclusion criteria including uncontrolled hypertension, history of heart failure (HF) NYHA III and 
IV, history of hemorrhagic stroke, new ACS within 2 weeks prior to the randomization, planned 
coronary revascularization (PCI or CABG). 
• 
Exclusion criteria related to lipid profile including triglycerides (TGs) >400 mg/dL (>4.52 mmol/L) 
during screening and run-in, use of red yeast rice during run-in. 
•  Other general exclusion criteria including history of cancer < 5 years, recent hypothyroidism, 
previous treatment with alirocumab. 
Treatments 
The patients were to be on stable diet (National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel 
III Therapeutic Lifestyle Change [NCEP-ATPIII TLC] diet or equivalent) throughout the entire study 
duration from screening to the end of the study. 
Patients were randomized to either background LMT + alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or background LMT + 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  
During the double-blind treatment period, the dosing of alirocumab was intended to achieve LDL-C levels 
within the range of 30 to 50 mg/dL (0.78 to 1.29 mmol/L), which is considered the physiological ideal 
level, and to avoid very low levels of LDL-C, ie, <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L).  
To achieve these intended LDL-C levels, the following up-titration or down-titration scheme (including 
discontinuation if needed) was applied: 
•  At Month 2 (or Month 4 if month 1 LDL-C was not available or not valid) patients randomized to 
alirocumab 75 mg Q2W, in a blinded manner, either: 
- 
Continued alirocumab 75 mg Q2W, when the Month 1 LDL-C was <50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) 
OR 
-  Were up-titrated to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W, when the Month 1 LDL-C was ≥50 mg/dL (1.29 
mmol/L). 
•  At subsequent visits, for patients on alirocumab, the following blinded adjustments were to be 
applied depending on the dose received: 
- 
For patients receiving 150 mg Q2W: if LDL-C <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) on 2 consecutive 
measurements, down-titration to 75 mg Q2W was performed in a blinded manner at the next 
visit. Additional monitoring was implemented until the down-titration was done. 
- 
For patients receiving 75 mg Q2W: 
-  When LDL-C was <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) on 2 consecutive measurements but at least 
1 value ≥15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L): alirocumab 75 mg Q2W was continued but additional 
monitoring was implemented, to further confirm the safety of low LDL-C levels. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 10/101 
 
  
 
 
 
   
-  When LDL-C was <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L) on 2 consecutive measurements and 
confirmed with direct measurement of LDL-C, alirocumab treatment was discontinued at 
the next visit. In order to maintain the blind, there was blinded substitution to placebo 
injections for the remaining duration of the study. Additional monitoring was 
implemented until the switch to placebo. This threshold of 15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L) was 
arbitrarily set due to the lack of available information on LDL-C levels below 15 mg/dL 
(0.39 mmol/L) (except in subjects with rare genetic mutations). 
Background therapy 
During the run-in period, patients were required to be on high intensity statin therapy (defined as 
atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg daily) or in case of tolerability issues, on a MTD 
of either of these 2 agents.  All other non-statin LMTs were also authorized with the exception of fibrates 
(other than fenofibrate and fenofibric acid) at the Investigator’s discretion. 
The main objective of the run-in period was for the Investigator to identify a background LMT regimen 
prior to the qualifying visit (V2 or combined V1/ V2), that met all the following criteria: the required high 
intensity statin therapy or an MTD (as defined above), optimized treatment for long-term chronic use, 
and tolerability after at least 2 weeks of stable dose prior to the qualifying visit. 
Patients who were not on statins could also be enrolled if documented intolerance to 2 or more statins was 
available and they had at least 2 weeks of non-statin LMT exposure prior to the screening visit (V1). Only 
after careful assessment (including after review of latest evidence and after discussion with the patient, 
his/her family, and the patient’s primary general practitioner/cardiologist), the Investigator could have 
the possibility to conclude that no background chronic LMT was appropriate for the patient. 
After randomization, the required background LMT regimen, as determined from the run-in period, was to 
be continued at a stable dose, as long as this regimen remained well tolerated. If, during the course of the 
study, significant tolerability concerns arose and the patient was found intolerant to any dose of 
atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, other statins (ie, other than atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) as well as 
non-statin LMTs were authorized. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the effect of alirocumab with placebo on the 
occurrence of CV events (composite endpoint of coronary heart disease [CHD] death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction [MI], fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina [UA] requiring 
hospitalization) in patients who have experienced an ACS event 4 to 52 weeks prior to randomization and 
are treated with an LMT regimen that is statin-intensive (defined as atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg, or 
rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg) or at maximally tolerated dose of these given statins and optimized for 
long-term chronic use with other non-statin LMT(s) at Investigator’s discretion. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the efficacy of alirocumab versus placebo on secondary endpoints (any CHD event, major 
CHD event, any CV event, composite of all-cause mortality/non-fatal MI/non-fatal ischemic stroke, all 
cause mortality). 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab throughout the study. 
To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies (ADA). 
To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and non-high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of one of the 
following clinical events (major adverse cardiac event [MACE]-plus), as determined by the CEC: 
•  CHD death (including “undetermined causes of death” as per the CEC); 
•  Any non-fatal MI; 
•  Fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke (including “stroke not otherwise specified” as per the CEC); 
•  UA requiring hospitalization. 
This composite endpoint comprised hard CV endpoints, ie CHD death, any non-fatal MI, and ischemic 
stroke. These endpoints are considered to be objective events easily identified. The other CV endpoint, UA 
requiring hospitalization, generally considered a "softer" CV endpoint is nevertheless a costly event that 
worsens the quality of life and therefore, treatments that reduce its frequency are clinically useful. For 
this specific CV endpoint stringent criteria were used to include only high-risk UA events, ie, with high-risk 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings together with evidence, during that hospitalization, of angiographically 
significant coronary disease (ie, with need for percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery 
bypass graft, or evidence of significant coronary stenosis >70%). 
The main secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Time from randomization to first occurrence of any CHD event (major CHD event, UA requiring 
hospitalization, ischemia-driven coronary revascularization procedure); 
•  Time from randomization to first occurrence of any major CHD event (CHD death, non-fatal MI); 
•  Time from randomization to first occurrence of any CV event (any non-fatal CHD event, any CV 
death, and non-fatal ischemic stroke); 
•  Time from randomization to first occurrence of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, non-fatal 
ischemic stroke; 
•  Time from randomization to CHD death; 
•  Time from randomization to CV death; 
•  Time from randomization to death (all-cause mortality). 
Any suspected CV event suggestive of an endpoint as well as any death had to be submitted to the CEC 
for adjudication. Only CV events adjudicated and validated by the CEC were used for the analyses, while 
events suspected by the Investigator but not confirmed by the CEC were not used for the analyses, except 
for sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Definitions of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints related to CV events and death were based on the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) 
Standardized Definitions for End Point Events in Cardiovascular Trials, and on the Thygesen Universal 
Definition for the definition of MI. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy variable. It was determined that 1613 
events would be needed to have 90% power (with one-sided Logrank test at the overall 0.025 alpha level) 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 12/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
to demonstrate an effect versus placebo assuming a 15% risk reduction associated with alirocumab 
treatment (ie, HR of 0.85) and considering 2 interim analyses. At study set-up, a sample size of 
approximately 18 000 patients (9000 per treatment group) was defined considering the enrolment 
projections and expected event rates. Per a protocol amendment, in order to reach the target of 
approximately 600 randomized patients in China based on local regulatory considerations, and given the 
delayed study start in this country, the total number of patients to be randomized was increased to 
approximately 18 600 patients (approximately 9300 per group). 
Randomisation 
Investigational medicinal products (alirocumab 75 mg or 150 mg kit, or placebo kit) were packaged in 
accordance with the randomized list of treatment kit numbers generated centrally by the Sponsor. The 
Project Demand Manager provided the randomized list of treatment kit numbers and the Study 
Biostatistician provided the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment allocation system 
provider. Then, this centralized treatment allocation system provider generated the patient 
randomization list to allocate the treatments to the patients. Two types of centralized treatment allocation 
system were used, the IVRS and the IWRS depending on the choice of the site. 
Patients were randomized to receive either alirocumab or placebo during the double-blind study 
treatment period using a 1:1 ratio (alirocumab: placebo), with permuted-block randomization. 
Randomization was stratified according to country. 
The treatment kit numbers were allocated using the centralized treatment allocation system on 
randomization visit (Day 1, Month 0), Month 2, Month 4, every 4 months up to Month 24, and then every 
6 months up to Month 64. For patients in the alirocumab treatment arm, the treatment kit allocated at 
Month 2 (V5) was based on their Month 1 (V4) LDL-C level, and the treatment kit allocated at Month 4 
(V6) was based on their Month 1 or 2 (V4 or V5) LDL-C following the up-titration rules. Regular transfer 
of data was planned between the central laboratory and the centralized treatment allocation system 
provider in order to proceed in a blinded manner for study sites and Sponsor. 
Blinding (masking) 
To protect the blind, alirocumab and placebo for alirocumab were provided in identically matched 
autoinjectors and packaged identically which included labeling. Each double-blind treatment kit was 
labeled with a number generated by a computer program from the Sponsor. The treatment kit numbers 
were obtained by the Investigator at the time of patient randomization and subsequent visits scheduled, 
via a centralized treatment allocation system that was available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In 
accordance with the double-blind design, patients, Investigators, and study site personnel remained 
blinded to study treatment without access to the randomization. 
Lipid parameter values collected at study visits and analyzed by the central laboratory were not 
communicated to Investigators after randomization to maintain the blind, but were communicated to 
IVRS/IWRS. 
In addition, local laboratory testing of lipid parameters was prohibited after the patient’s randomization, 
as specifically mentioned in both the ICF and the protocol, in order to prevent any possible unblinding by 
local laboratory testing. The protocol also highlighted the need for the Investigator to periodically remind 
and educate the general practitioner /cardiologist about the study requirements, ie, during the entire 
study, general practitioner/cardiologist had to refrain from checking lipid levels at a local laboratory, and 
were not to modify LMT regimen without discussing with the Investigator. This caution was also 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 13/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
emphasized in protocol training materials for monitoring teams and sites. Reminders were made at the 
Investigator meetings, and sent to the monitoring team and sites through newsletters and e-mail news 
bulletins. Caution was continuously raised to sites throughout the study. Patients who achieved 2 
consecutive calculated LDL-C values <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) were monitored. In order to maintain the 
integrity of the blind as much as possible with this monitoring process, the following points were 
undertaken: 
•  Specific steps were in place to ensure that the work which was carried out by Covance central 
laboratory group, the communication between Covance central laboratory and IVRS/IWRS, and the 
communication with the Independent Physician(s), who was responsible for monitoring AEs in 
patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C levels <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L), was in strict confidence. 
• 
• 
The Independent Physician(s) worked if needed with the dedicated member of the phase 3a DMC, 
subsequently replaced by the Medical Liaison, independently from the Sponsor. This dedicated phase 
3a DMC member / Medical Liaison then transmitted any information as necessary to the common 
member involved in both DMCs (CV DMC and phase 3a DMC). 
The actual LDL-C levels (collected at study visits and analyzed by Covance central lab) were not 
reported to the sites. 
•  Monitoring by the Independent Physician(s) continued for as long as LDL-C level remained <25 mg/dL 
(0.65 mmol/L). 
Patients’ ADA results were not communicated to the sites during the study. The Sponsor had no access to 
ADA associated with patient identification until after the final database lock had occurred. The laboratory 
technicians involved in the determination of patients’ ADA were excluded from the operational team and 
a process was set-up to prevent any potential unblinding. 
The CEC reviewed and adjudicated, in a blinded manner, suspected CV events and all deaths occurring 
from randomization to CSED. 
The NCEP (neurocognitive experts panel) reviewed in a blinded manner neurocognitive AEs reported 
during the study. The DEP (diabetes experts panel) reviewed in a blinded manner the potential cases of 
diabetes solely identified via antidiabetic medication use, occurring before, at baseline, or after baseline 
and not reported as “diabetes at baseline” or “new onset diabetes” AEs, nor associated with HbA1c or 
fasting glucose falling into the diabetes category. For the safety data review, the DMC reviewed unblinded 
data provided by an independent Statistician 
Regular DMC safety analyses and both interim analyses were performed by the external independent CV 
DMC statistician and reviewed under the supervision of the CV DMC. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, consisting of all 
randomized patients. Patients in the ITT population were analyzed according to the treatment group 
allocated by randomization. All analyses of efficacy endpoints were performed based on ITT approach that 
included all events (including those occurring after treatment discontinuation, and consequently also 
after switch to placebo based on 2 consecutive LDL-C values <15 mg/dL) occurring from randomization to 
the CSED. In addition, a supportive analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was performed during the 
treatment period. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 14/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The Safety population considered for safety analyses was the randomized population who did actually 
receive at least one dose or part of a dose of the double-blind IMP. Patients were analyzed (in the section 
Clinical Safety) according to the treatment actually received (placebo or alirocumab). 
The analysis of primary efficacy endpoint (in the section Clinical Efficacy) was the comparison 
between the two treatments using the log-rank test procedure stratified by region (North America, South 
America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, Other). As the number of events per individual country 
was expected to be low (about 50 countries), the analysis were stratified according to a grouping of 
countries into regions. 
This primary comparison is the test of the following hypotheses on the hazard ratio (HR), applying a 
one-sided nominal type I error of 0.0249 at the final analysis: 
H0: HR ≥1 versus H1: HR <1 
The estimates of the HR and corresponding confidence interval at (1-2α) % level (α being the one-sided 
nominal significance level: α=0.249 at final analysis, α=0.0003 at second interim analysis) were provided 
using a Cox Proportional Hazard Model stratified by region as for the log-rank test described above. 
Consistency of the treatment effect across regions was assessed. 
Underlying assumptions of the Cox Proportional Hazard Model were checked using graphical methods. If 
proportionality is not observed, some ad-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed depending on the data 
(data-driven). 
The survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates: cumulative incidence of events at 6 
months and by year, and appropriate confidence interval were  presented by treatment arm using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates. Kaplan-Meier curves will be displayed by treatment arm. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint: 
•  Primary efficacy endpoint as per Investigator: including any events up to the CSED with final 
diagnosis by the Investigator confirming the event, whether or not confirmed by the CEC. 
•  Tipping point analyses: To assess the robustness of the results relative to missing information on 
the primary endpoint (patients without follow-up on CV events up to the CSED), a tipping-point 
analysis was performed to determine the imputed HR (for the period with missing information) at 
which the statistical significance was lost. 
Supportive analyses for the primary endpoint: 
•  Analysis including recurrent events for MACE-plus as per CEC adjudication: analysis on all events 
(ie, including recurrent events after the primary efficacy endpoints). 
Additional analyses for the primary endpoint: 
•  An analysis to evaluate the relationship between LDL-C and the risk of MACE-plus. Two models 
were used, one with the time-dependent covariate (time-weighted averaged LDL-C) as a 
continuous variable to get the reduction of MACE-plus risk per 1 mmol/L of reduction in LDL-C and 
one with the time-dependent covariate as a categorical variable to get the reduction of MACE-plus 
risk for each category compared to the reference category of LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL. 
Two interim analyses (IA) were performed. The cut-off dates of final and interim analyses were 
expected to be: 
• 
First interim analysis (futility): when 807 patients have experienced at least one primary efficacy 
event (50% fraction information) 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 15/101 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Second interim analysis (futility and efficacy): when 1210 patients have experienced at least one 
primary efficacy event (75% fraction information) 
• 
Final analysis: when 1613 patients have experienced at least one primary efficacy event or 24 
months after the last date of randomization ex-China, whichever comes last 
Both IA were performed by the external independent CV DMC Statistician and were reviewed under the 
supervision of the CV DMC. The CV DMC  also reviewed secondary efficacy endpoints and safety data 
(AEs, laboratory data, vital signs) available at the time of the IA. 
Control of the type I and type II error were ensured using gamma (-5) spending function for Type II error 
(futility) and Gamma (-22) for Type I error (efficacy) at each IA (the Type I error spending function was 
also applied at the first IA, even if the objective of this first IA is only futility). It has to be noted that, in 
order to protect the global type one error in case the decision is taken to overrule the futility rule, non 
binding boundaries were used. 
Subgroup analyses 
For the primary endpoint, the treatment effects across the following subgroup factors were examined: 
•  Gender 
•  Age group (<65, ≥65) 
•  Race (Caucasian, Black, Asian/Oriental, and Other, as appropriate) 
•  Country (IVRS stratum, depending on the size of subgroups) 
•  Region (USA/Non-USA, and North America/South America/Eastern Europe/Western 
Europe/Asia/Rest of world) 
•  Time from ACS event to randomization (eg, 4-24 weeks, > 24 weeks) 
For each parameter, a Cox proportional hazard model was used for the overall population, including the 
parameter and the treatment by parameter interaction. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves and summary 
statistics showing number of patients, number (%) of primary efficacy outcome events, cumulative 
incidence of events at 6 month and by year, and appropriate confidence interval might be provided for 
each treatment arm in previously selected subgroups defined by the baseline characteristic/prognostic 
factors. 
In addition, the effect of the time from ACS event to randomization (weeks) was assessed using a Cox 
proportional hazard model including the time from ACS event to randomization (continuous) as a 
covariate, the treatment group and the interaction. Time to events secondary endpoints were analyzed 
using the same statistical methodology as for the primary endpoint. 
The percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Month 4, at Month 24 and at the end of the study 
will be analyzed in the ITT population using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
group and region as fixed effects, and the baseline calculated LDL-C as covariate. 
Similar analyses were performed for ApoB and non-HDL. Based on previous experiences and published 
data on these endpoints, the assumptions of normality of the residuals, homogeneity of slopes and 
homoscedasticity underlying these models are usually valid. 
Throughout the ANCOVA models, the alirocumab group was compared to placebo using an appropriate 
contrast tested at the two-sided 0.05 level, and providing the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the 
difference. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 16/101 
 
  
 
 
 
In order to handle multiple main secondary endpoints, the overall Type-I error was controlled by the 
use of a sequential inferential approach. Statistical significance of the primary parameter was required 
before drawing inferential conclusions about first key secondary parameter (at the 00003 one-sided alpha 
level at the second interim analysis or at the 0.0249 one-sided alpha level at the final analysis). 
Inferential conclusions about successive main secondary parameters required statistical significance of 
the prior one. 
This fixed hierarchical approach ensured a strong control of the overall type-I error rate at the required 
one-sided level (0.0003 for the second interim analysis and 0.0249 at the final analysis). 
No further adjustments were made for other secondary endpoints or subgroup analyses for which 
p-values were provided for descriptive purpose only.

A total of 16513 subjects had a screening failure. Most important reasons for screening failure are: not 
meeting lipid targets (n=12068), patients who withdrew consent (n=2160), and exclusion based on 
(other) laboratory values (n=1414). A total of 18 924 patients were randomized to receive alirocumab or 
placebo (9462 patients in each group). In both treatment groups, almost all of the patients (99.8%) 
received at least 1 dose of the investigational medicine product (IMP).

Recruitment 
The run-in period started with a screening visit (V1) (see section methods). 
A patient who failed screening and left the study was allowed to undergo rescreening and re-enter the 
study (only once) under the following scenarios: 
• 
If lipid inclusion criteria (LDL-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B) at V2/V2b were met during a first initial 
screening with a given statin dose and patient failed screening for a reason not related to these 
lipid inclusion criteria, then patient could be rescreened using the same statin at the same dose 
or, if documented intolerance, with the same statin at a lower dose or other authorized statin or 
no statin (latter option only if patient had documented intolerance to 2 or more statins). 
•  However, if lipid inclusion criteria at V2/V2b (LDL-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B) were not met during a 
first screening with a given statin dose, patients could not be rescreened using the same statin at 
the same dose. Such patients could only be rescreened if statin intolerance had developed 
subsequently and the statin regimen had been changed.  
A total of 35437 patients were screened, while a number of 16513 patients failed screening (see 
disposition). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 11 protocol amendments, including 4 global amendments that applied to all patients and 7 
local amendments that only applied to patients in specific countries; the changes introduced by these 
amendments are summarized in Table 2 below. 
Both the NCEP (neurocognitive expert panel) and the DEP (diabetes expert panel) were implemented 
after the start of the study, respectively on 25 September 2015 and 07 September 2016.

Baseline data 
General baseline characteristics and CV history 
General baseline characteristics are provided in the tables below. Overall prior to their index ACS event, 
34.0% of patients had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) prior to the index ACS event including 
19.2% with a history of MI and 22.7% with a history of coronary revascularization procedures (coronary 
artery bypass graft/percutaneous coronary intervention), 3.2% with a history of stroke, 4.0% with a 
history of peripheral artery disease (PAD), and 14.9% reported congestive heart failure. Cardiovascular 
risk factors prior to the run-in period were reported for most of the randomized patients (88.9%), 
including hypertension (64.7% of patients), family history of CAD (35.8%), and diabetes (in 24.5% of 
patients when based on reported medical history, and in 28.8% of patients when based on the definition 
of diabetes as prespecified in the SAP). Other CV diseases prior to the run-in period include dyslipidemia 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 24/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
are reported in 66.7% of patients. This observation is supported by the fact that only approximately 30% 
of patients were taking statins for at least 3 months prior to the index ACS event.  
Regarding the index ACS event, 83.2% of patients presented with MI diagnosed through cardiac 
biomarker elevation (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] in 34.6% and non-ST segment 
elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] in 48.6% of patients), or UA in 16.8% of patients. The median 
time from ACS event to randomization was 2.6 months, with 72.6% of patients having been randomized 
less than 4 months after the index ACS event.  
At the qualifying visit, almost all patients (99.5%) had lipid levels not adequately controlled. At this 
qualifying visit, about 8% of patients did not qualify with an LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L), but 
rather qualified based on Apo B (0.3% only on Apo B) and/or non-HDL-C (7.2% only on non-HDL-C).

LDL-C levels at baseline 
Overall, mean LDL-C at baseline was 92.4 mg/dL (2.392 mmol/L), mean non-HDL-C was 122.3 mg/dL 
(3.169 mmol/L), and mean Apo-B was 83.1 mg/dL (0.8 g/L). 
A total of 19.8% (3751) of patients had a LDL-C <70 mg/dL (<1.81 mmol/L) at baseline. This proportion 
was higher than that observed at the qualifying visit (about 8%) and is likely explained by the known 
variability of LDL-C within individuals over short periods of time, more particularly for patients who do not 
have yet a confirmation in the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia due to these fluctuations. 
Concomitant treatment including statin use 
Overall, only one-third (32.6%) of patients who were randomized in the study were treated with statin for 
at least 3 months prior to the index ACS event.  
At randomization patients were receiving the best standard of care with LMT. Treatment groups were well 
balanced with regard to the background LMT regimen. Most patients (88.8%) were receiving high dose 
statin (ie, atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily), 8.5% were receiving 
low/moderate dose statin (ie, atorvastatin <40 mg daily and/or rosuvastatin <20 mg daily), and 0.2% 
were receiving another statin. The other patients were receiving only LMT other than statins (1.5%) or 
were not receiving any LMT (0.9%). The main reason for not receiving high dose statin was muscle 
symptoms and/or increased CPK while taking statin (5.8% of patients).  
During the course of the study, the proportion of patients receiving intensive statin slightly decreased in 
both treatment groups. This decrease was greater in the alirocumab group (from 88.6% at baseline to 
81.9% at Month 48) than in the placebo group (from 89.1% at baseline to 86.3% at Month 48). The 
percentage of patients not receiving statins increased from 2.5% at randomization to 5.8% at Month 48 
in the alirocumab group and from 2.4% at randomization to 4.2% at Month 48 in the placebo group. 
A total of 460 patients were not taking statin at randomization (see table below). The reasons for not 
taking statin are described.

The number of patients included in each analysis population is provided in Table 9 below. The randomized 
population consisted of 18 924 patients, 9462 in the alirocumab group and 9462 in the placebo group. All 
patients were included in the ITT population. Almost all patients (18 894, 99.8%) received at least one 
dose of double-blind IMP and were included in the safety population. The ADA population included 18 188 
patients.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study treatment 
Of the 9451 patients randomized and treated in the alirocumab group, 2615 (27.7%) had their dose 
up-titrated to 150 mg. Of these 2615 patients, 805 (8.5% of the total number of patients) had their dose 
subsequently down-titrated to 75 mg. A total of 730 (7.7%) patients while receiving alirocumab 75 mg 
Q2W were switched to placebo due to 2 consecutive LDL-C values <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L), most of 
them between 4 to 12 months after initiation of treatment with alirocumab. 
The median duration of follow-up for CV events/vital status was approximately 33 months which resulted 
in more than 53 000 patient-years of follow-up. Ascertainment was complete for 99.1% and 99.8% of 
potential patient-years of follow-up for the primary endpoint and death, respectively, highlighting the 
robustness in the collection of the data and consequently in the results. 
Primary endpoint 
Alirocumab significantly reduced the risk of MACE-plus (composite endpoint of CHD death, non-fatal MI, 
fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, or UA requiring hospitalization) as compared to placebo. The primary 
endpoint occurred in 903 (9.5%) patients in the alirocumab group and in 1052 (11.1%) patients in the 
placebo group, corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 15.0% (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.93, 
p=0.0003) as illustrated in Figure 3 below. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curves for first 
occurrence of MACE-plus for the alirocumab and placebo groups began to diverge at approximately 1 year 
after randomization and continued to diverge up to the end of the study.

Figure 3: Time to first occurrence of MACE-plus (primary efficacy endpoint) as per CEC - 
Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curve ITT population - EFC11570 
The most common first event of the composite endpoint in the study was non-fatal MI for 68.1% 
(615/903) and 66.3% (698/1052) of the cases of MACE-plus in the alirocumab and placebo groups, 
respectively. For the other events contributing to the composite endpoint of MACE-plus, the occurrence 
was by decreasing frequency as follows: CHD death (including undetermined causes of death), fatal or 
non-fatal ischemic stroke (including “stroke not otherwise specified”), and UA requiring hospitalization 
(with this component accounting for only 3.2% [29/903] and 4.9% [52/1052] of cases in the alirocumab 
and placebo groups, respectively). Significant reductions of 14%, 27%, and 39% were observed in the 
risk of non-fatal MI, ischemic stroke, and UA requiring hospitalization, respectively. A positive trend in the 
risk of CHD death (also main secondary endpoint) with a reduction of 8% was also observed.

ischaemic stroke, or UA requiring hospitalization, CHD = coronary heart disease, MI = myocardial 
infarction, UA = unstable angina 
Secondary endpoints 
A hierarchical testing procedure was used to test the main secondary endpoints while controlling for 
multiplicity. Statistical significance was reached down through the composite endpoint “all-cause 
mortality, non-fatal MI, non-fatal ischemic stroke”. For this composite endpoint including all-cause 
mortality instead of CHD or CV death and 2 other hard endpoints, all the components individually 
demonstrated nominal statistical significant reductions in the alirocumab versus placebo groups. 
CHD death was the first endpoint for which statistical significance was not reached. P-values for the 
subsequent endpoints in the hierarchy, starting from CV death, were provided for descriptive purpose. 
Although this hierarchical procedure was stopped when the main secondary endpoint CHD death did not 
reach statistical significance despite a risk reduction of 8%, the subsequent 2 main secondary endpoints, 
CV death and all-cause death, also showed risk reductions of 12% and 15% in favor of alirocumab, 
respectively, with nominal p-values of 0.1528 for CV death and 0.026 for all-cause death (Table 12).

ITT 
For the first 4 endpoints up to the composite endpoint “all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, non-fatal 
ischemic stroke” where a significant reduction in the risk was observed, a consistent profile of the 
Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curve was seen, with the 2 curves starting to diverge from about 1 
year after randomization. 
Overall, the analysis of all-cause death indicated that CV death accounted for 63.9% of the total 
726 deaths from any cause. Thus the treatment effect observed on all-cause death was partially driven by 
EMA/152718/2019

the treatment effect observed on non-CV deaths (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.01). During the 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) period the reduction of all-cause death with alirocumab over 
placebo (233 [2.5%] in the alirocumab groups versus 273 [2.9%] in the placebo group) was driven by CV 
death (169 [1.8%] in the alirocumab group versus 202 [2.1%] in the placebo group) and not by non-CV 
deaths (54 [0.6%] in the alirocumab group versus 59 [0.6%] in the placebo group). In the 
post-treatment period up to the CSED, the reduction in all-cause death was primarily driven by non-CV 
death (40 [0.4%] in the alirocumab group versus 62 [0.7%] in the placebo group). 
For non-CV death, the effect was driven by pulmonary events (mainly pneumonia and lung cancer; 33 
[0.3%] and 47 [0.5%] patients in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively), gastrointestinal 
events (6 [<0.1%] and 13 [0.1%] patients, respectively), and other non-CV causes (including cancers; 
22 [0.2%] and 28 [0.3%] patients, respectively) with a difference in favour of alirocumab.

Lipid parameters were analyzed using an ITT approach (based on the ITT population) including all lipid 
values, regardless of whether the patient was continuing therapy or not (therefore included lipid values of 
the 730 patients who switched to placebo due to 2 consecutive LDL-C values <15 mg/dL [0.39 mmol/L]). 
In case of missing values, different imputations were performed according to whether the missing value 
was during the treatment period or post-treatment. 
In addition, analyses were also conducted using an on-treatment approach (based on the randomized and 
treated population) only including lipid data collected during the treatment period (up to 21 days after the 
last alirocumab injection for patients prematurely discontinued as well as patients switched to placebo). 
In case of missing values, imputations were performed from the other on-treatment values.  
These 2 approaches to the analysis of the lipid parameters and more particularly for LDL-C provide 
different information relevant to the understanding of the effect of alirocumab in the context of this large 
CV outcomes study. The ITT approach evaluates the effect of alirocumab on a population of patients in 
whom the therapy is managed in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and 
provides the best estimate of the LDL-C levels over the course of the study during the same period in 
which the effect on CV events and mortality was assessed. The on-treatment approach is relevant to the 
clinical question of efficacy as it evaluates the effects that can be expected in patients when the product 
is actually used. 
Patients in the alirocumab group achieved a mean LDL-C value of 42.7 mg/dL (1.106 mmol/L) at Month 
1 (mean baseline value: 92.4 mg/dL, 2.394 mmol/L), and mean LDL-C value was 66.4 mg/dL (1.721 
mmol/L) at Month 48. 
In the ITT analysis, a LS mean difference in percent change from baseline of -39.9% (95% CI: -44.6 to 
-35.2; nominal p<0.0001) was observed at Month 48. In the alirocumab group, mean percent change 
from baseline LDL-C reached a nadir of -55.8% at Month 4, rising to -45.7% at Month 12, and -23.5% at 
Month 48, and corresponding to differences versus placebo of -60.1%, -53.7%, and -39.9%, 
respectively. Evolution of LDL-C over time is illustrated in the figure below.  
When comparing result from the on-treatment analysis, which excluded off-treatment LDL-C values for 
patients prematurely withdrawn from study treatment and those of the 730 patients switched to placebo 
due to 2 consecutive values <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L), a LS mean difference of -54.7% (95% CI: -57.5 
to -52.0; nominal p<0.0001) was noted at Month 48. Mean changes from baseline in LDL-C in the 
alirocumab group at Months 4, 12, and 48 were -58.3%, -52.8%, and -40.1%, respectively, 
corresponding to differences versus placebo of -62.7%, -59.0%, and -54.7%, respectively

In the ITT analysis, a significant decrease in Apo B from baseline to Month 24 was observed in the 
alirocumab group (LS mean: -31.6%) compared to the placebo group (LS mean: +9.0%), with an LS 
mean difference for alirocumab versus placebo of -40.6% (95% CI: -41.7 to -39.5; nominal p<0.0001). 
The evolution over time for Apo B followed the same pattern as for LDL-C. 
In the ITT analysis, a significant decrease in non-HDL-C from baseline to Month 48 was observed in the 
alirocumab group (LS mean: -18.6%) compared to the placebo group (+13.9%), with an LS mean 
difference of –32.5% (95% CI: -36.1 to -28.9; nominal p<0.0001). The evolution over time for 
non-HDL-C followed the same pattern as for LDL-C. 
In the ITT analysis, a significant decrease in Lp(a) from baseline to Month 12 was observed in the 
alirocumab group (robust mean: -23.4%) compared with the placebo group (robust mean: -3.5%); with 
a robust mean difference for alirocumab versus placebo of –20.0% (95% CI: -20.9 to -19.0; nominal 
p<0.0001).

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint 
Other analyses of the primary endpoint, including sensitivity analyses and supportive analyses that were 
performed provide additional information with regard to the consistency and robustness of the results 
observed in the study. Among these analyses, 2 analyses are of particular interest: 
•  A sensitivity analysis, the tipping-point analysis for incomplete follow-up for CV events: although 
in terms of patient-years, missing information represented only 0.9% leading to 99.1% 
ascertainment rate which is a very high rate, a tipping-point analysis was done to assess the 
robustness of the results relative to missing information on the primary endpoint.  
This tipping point analysis for MACE-plus was conducted using 2 different scenarios. In both 
scenarios, the tipping-point was reached for an imputed HR between 18 and 18.5, and between 
11.5 and 12, for the 2 scenarios. It was concluded from these analyses that the results were 
robust to missing status on the primary endpoint since these tipping-points were highly 
implausible. 
•  A supportive analysis of the relationship between achieved LDL-C and risk of MACE-plus: this 
analysis that took into account baseline and all post-baseline LDL-C values did not assess the 
effect of alirocumab but rather assessed the association between LDL-C level (regardless of the 
way to achieve such levels including diet, physical activity, statins, other LMTs, or alirocumab) 
and MACE-plus risk. 
Subgroup analyses 
The relative risk reduction obtained with alirocumab compared to placebo was consistent (or higher) in 
patients with high CV risk according to baseline LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL as shown below according to main 
individual prognostic factors of MACE-plus (diabetes, BMI, time from ACS to randomization, baseline 
Lp[a] and CV risk scores [TIMI and abbreviated REACH scores]). Therefore, the 15% relative risk 
reduction with alirocumab led to a greater absolute risk reduction and greater benefit for the patients with 
higher baseline CV risks (ie, patients with diabetes, patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m², patients with baseline 
LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL, patients with baseline Lp[a] ≥50 mg/dL, and patients with high CV risk scores, and 
patients randomized shortly after the qualifying ACS event [<8 weeks, ≥8 weeks to <24 weeks]).

Figure 5: Time to first occurrence of MACE-plus (primary endpoint) as per CEC according to 
demographic characteristics - Forest plot (1/2) - ITT population – EFC11570 
Subgroup of patients with baseline LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL 
In the subgroup of patients with baseline LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL, the risk of MACE-plus was reduced by 24% 
as compared to placebo (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.87). The greater treatment effect of alirocumab 
observed in this subgroup of patients can be explained by the higher absolute reduction in LDL-C versus 
placebo (-43.8 to -65.2 mg/dL during the course of the study) in those patients with higher LDL-C values 
at baseline (mean baseline LDL-C of 128.5 mg/dL) compared to patients with lower LDL-C values at 
baseline (from -27.2 to -44.1 mg/dL during the course of the study for patients with baseline LDL-C 
<80 mg/dL and from -37.4 to -54.2 mg/dL during the course of the study for patients with baseline LDL-C 
≥80 and <100 mg/dL).   
In addition, as expected based on the literature, patients in the placebo group with high baseline LDL-C 
(≥100 mg/dL) in the OUTCOMES study have a higher CV risk (event rate of 14.9%) compared to patients 
in the placebo group with lower baseline LDL-C (9.5%). This higher baseline CV risk led to a greater 
absolute reduction in MACE-plus in the alirocumab group compared to the placebo group (3.4% observed 
in the study).  
In this particular subgroup, the Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curves for first occurrence of 
MACE-plus for the alirocumab and placebo groups began to diverge at about 6 months after 
randomization and continued to separate up to the end of the study.

Post-hoc analyses revealed that the magnitude of the treatment effect of alirocumab over placebo for all 
other efficacy endpoints was consistently greater than that seen in the overall population, supporting the 
greater benefit derived for this subgroup of patients. In particular, a notable benefit was seen for all death 
endpoints, with a reduction in the risk of CHD death of 28%, a reduction in the risk of CV death of 31%, 
and a reduction in the risk of all-cause death of 29% (see Table 15 below). This observation of a greater 
effect on different endpoints and notably on all-cause death and CV death in patients with baseline LDL-C 
≥100 mg/dL is in line with a recent meta-analysis reported by Navarese et al. which showed a death 
benefit only in patients with baseline LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL.

The table below presents the primary efficacy endpoint data by subgroup according to baseline 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values (LDL-C < 70mg/dL or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL). In patients 
with baseline LDL-C < 70mg/dL (whatever the LMT regimen during the run-in phase), the primary 
endpoint occurred in 8.6% patients in the alirocumab group and 9.6% patients in the placebo group, with 
a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.73-1.11). The treatment effect was not significantly different in 
patients with baseline LDL-C <70 versus ≥70 mg/dL (interaction p value of 0.53).

Relationship between LDL-C reduction and CV risk reduction 
Per the CTT Collaboration meta-analysis, that showed a 22% CV risk reduction per 1 mmol/L decrease in 
LDL-C, data from the OUTCOMES study showed consistent results with an estimated 25% MACE-plus 
reduction per 1 mmol/L decrease of LDL-C (HR: 0.75; 95% CI [0.72 to 0.78]). In another analysis in 
which the category of LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL was the referent group, compared to this category, the risk of 
MACE-plus was reduced by 70% (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.58) when reaching LDL-C <20 mg/dL and 
by 53% (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.53) when reaching LDL-C between 20 and 50 mg/dL. Therefore this 
analysis suggested that there is a further CV risk reduction when achieving LDL-C <20 mg/dL.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
As described in the original dossier, the phase 3 program consisted of 10 studies with a double-blind 
treatment duration from 6 months to 24 months. This program was mainly focused on patients at very 
high or high CV risk and receiving a maximally tolerated dose of a potent statin, with or without other 
LMTs, representing ~80% of the total population. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies had 
CVD, including patients after ACS (at least 3 months). The definition of CV risk was based on US and EU 
guidelines in effect at the time of clinical development plan finalization. The European Society of 
Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) 2011 guidelines and 2012 update were 
used to delineate very high and high CV risk. Overall, 5138 patients (97.0%) were at high/very high CV 
risk, including 70.6% (n=3518 patients) with ASCVD (including coronary artery, cerebrovascular, or 
peripheral artery disease) and 64.1% with a history of clinical CHD (encompassing prior MI, stroke, or 
PAD), and about 4% of patients with history of ACS of less than 12 months. Out of the 4219 patients 
randomized in the 6 studies using maximally tolerated dose of statin as a background therapy, 56.4% 
were treated with high intensity statin (ie, the same definition as for the OUTCOMES study: atorvastatin 
40 mg or 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg). In the context of this large phase 3 program, a 
comprehensive assessment of the benefit/risk balance with alirocumab included an assessment on the CV 
outcomes in order to get preliminary data prior to the results from the OUTCOMES study, even though 
patients enrolled in the OUTCOMES study were at higher risk. CV events were therefore adjudicated by 
the CEC in charge of the adjudication for the OUTCOMES study. 
Although these studies were not designed or powered to provide positive CV outcomes evidence, based 
on the population enrolled, mainly patients at high risk with established CV disease, the duration of 18 to 
24 months for 5 of the 10 studies, and the preliminary data demonstrating the strong LDL-C lowering 
effect with alirocumab, there was an expectation to obtain a beneficial trend for the reduction in CV 
events in favor of alirocumab versus the control groups (placebo and ezetimibe). 
Results from the global pool of phase 3 studies demonstrated a lower rate of CV events positively 
adjudicated for MACE-plus in the alirocumab group versus placebo/ezetimibe group resulting in a risk 
reduction of 15% (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.27).

Efficacy of alirocumab on this broader ASCVD population was also shown in the largest phase 3 study, 
LONG TERM study, in which the efficacy and safety of alirocumab was evaluated for 18 months in 2341 
patients with established CHD (70%) or a CHD risk equivalent (including 9.9% of patients with prior 
history of ischemic stroke, and 5.2% of patients with PAD) or with HeFH, and receiving maximally 
tolerated statin therapy. In this single study, the rate of MACE-plus was lower with alirocumab than with 
placebo (1.7% vs. 3.3%) with a relative risk reduction of 48% (HR of 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.31 to 0.90); nominal p = 0.02).  
The observations at the time of the phase 3 studies and LONG TERM study were very similar to the results 
observed in the OUTCOMES study despite the limitations described above and the fact that the population 
enrolled in the OUTCOMES study was at higher CV risk. The consistency in the results between the phase 
3 program and the OUTCOMES study support the robustness of the results and the benefit of alirocumab 
in reducing MACE-plus in patients with CHD. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Antibody response 
Alirocumab was associated with a low level of immunogenicity.  
Treatment-emergent ADA assay responses were observed in 504 (5.5%) patients in the alirocumab 
group and in 149 (1.6%) patients in the placebo group; however, the majority of these were low titer and 
transient responses. Persistent treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 0.7% and 0.4% of 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 51/101 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively; the majority of these were also low titer 
responses. Only a few patients were positive for neutralizing antibodies (NAb) (43 [0.5%] patients in the 
alirocumab group and 6 (<0.1%) patients in the placebo group); most were positive only at a single 
occasion. Only 5 (<0.1%) patients in the alirocumab group and 1 patient in the placebo group had a 
positive NAb response on more than one occasion. 
The percent change from baseline in LDL-C was explored according to the treatment-emergent ADA 
response (ie, persistent, transient, or indeterminate) and according to ADA titer. A substantial reduction 
of LDL-C was observed, regardless of the ADA status. 
Figure 7: Percent change from baseline in LDL-C versus ADA titer at Month 36 during the 
treatment period 
For each of the 43 patients in the alirocumab group with a NAb positive response, the ADA titers, the NAb 
positivity, and the LDL-C concentrations were plotted over time.  
Anti-drug antibody responses, including NAb, did not appear to have a clinically meaningful impact on the 
efficacy of alirocumab. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH submitted study EFC11570 ODYSSEY to investigate the effect of alirocumab on CV risk 
reduction. The study was a multicentre, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study comparing the treatment of alirocumab 75 mg Q2W with possible uptitration to 150 
mg Q2W after 2 months on top of optimal lipid lowering therapy versus background therapy (placebo 
arm). The primary objective is acceptable, except for the definition of the CV events, see further below. 
The secondary objectives are also relevant to provide further insight and support for the primary 
objective. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 52/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should have been treated with optimal lipid lowering therapy before randomisation defined as 
intense statin therapy by atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg daily, while other 
additional lipid lowering therapy was also allowed (except for fibrates). A documented intolerance to 2 or 
more statins and at least 2 weeks of non-statin LMT exposure prior to the screening visit can be 
acceptable to justify any absence of statin background therapy. This has previously been applied in the 
statin-intolerance studies during initial MAA.  
A run-in phase of 2 to 16 weeks was used to identify those patients not on treatment goal with lipid 
lowering therapy and to initiate lipid lowering statin therapy for those not on high intensity statins. The 
use of a background therapy of moderate to high dose statin was an eligibility criterion to be applied 
during the run-in phase. Background statin therapy of at least atorvastatin 40 mg daily or at least 
rosuvastatin 20 mg (≥ 2 weeks on stable dose) was considered to represent high intensity statins use. 
Evaluation after 2 weeks of treatment is considered limited, and not in line with general dose 
recommendations for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, although data suggest an optimal treatment effect 
was already achieved after 2 weeks of statin treatment.  
Inclusion criteria (at randomisation) reflect a population with established cardiovascular disease 
determined by recent prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS) defined as patients hospitalised for an ACS 
event (STEMI, NSTEMI or UA (unstable angina)) 4 to 52 weeks prior to inclusion.  According to the 2016 
European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice (p. 2330) these patients can 
be classified as patients with a very-high CV risk. 
The risk classification based on LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L) is considered appropriate and in line 
with the ESC dyslipidaemia guideline 2016. However, apolipoprotein B (Apo B) ≥80 mg/dL (≥0.8 g/L), or 
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L) are considered risk 
markers that can be used but this is especially of relevance when TG levels are high (ESC guideline). 
Specific treatment recommendations of patients with very high CV risk comply with the proposed LDL-C 
inclusion level (most important) and non-HDL-C inclusion level, however, any specific treatment level for 
Apo B is not given in the ESC guideline.  
The exclusion criteria are generally acceptable to minimize interference with the main objectives of the 
study and allow optimal study adherence. Not allowing patient below the age of 40 years is not standard 
but could increase the CV risk profile. 
After randomisation and initiation of treatment with 75 Q2W or placebo, patients could be uptitrated after 
2 months of treatment from the 75 mg Q2W to 150 Q2W of alirocumab. This is considered acceptable as 
the optimal effect of the 75 mg Q2W should then be achieved, although a 3 months period was used in the 
studies in the initial dossier. The subsequent possibility of downtitration after this period is also 
acceptable, as this would appropriately reflect clinical practice. Further, the downtitration criteria and 
discontinuation criteria (substitution to placebo injection) when very low levels of LDL-C are observed 
(<25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) or <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L)) is considered appropriate.  
The primary endpoint is a composite of time to coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, fatal 
and non-fatal stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation whichever came first.  Unstable 
angina, in addition to the "harder" endpoints of MI, stroke and CHD death, is considered less robust in 
particular with respect to objective definitions and possible bias in relation to clinical decision-making. An 
important key secondary endpoint defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, is 
considered of importance as this is the preferred endpoint according to the EMA guideline CV prevention 
[Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products for cardiovascular disease prevention 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/311890/2007)]. It would have been preferred if this endpoint was higher in the 
hierarchical testing approach. Investigating CHD death is acceptable and has been accepted as composite 
of the primary endpoint in previous CV intervention studies, though there is current preference to 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 53/101 
 
  
 
 
 
investigate overall mortality. Sufficient confidence regarding overall mortality and non-CV mortality is 
necessary in this case. Overall mortality is investigated as secondary endpoint, which is acceptable. 
Further evaluation of other single and components of cardiovascular events is acceptable as they could 
further support the key analyses and provide further knowledge of the treatment effect on cardiovascular 
prevention. Confirmation of the known LDL-C lowering effect is also of relevance. 
Adjudication strategy by an independent CEC is considered standard procedure in large CV intervention 
trials and acceptable. Definitions according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Clinical Data 
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Standardized Definitions for End Point Events in 
Cardiovascular Trials, and on the Thygesen Universal Definition for the definition of MI, is acceptable. 
The randomisation procedure is considered adequate. One stratification factor of country is acceptable. 
The blinding methods of the study are sufficiently described and acceptable. 
Including several independent panels, especially for adjudication of efficacy events, is supported. 
The study populations included an ITT population for all efficacy analyses and a safety population. 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints use Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard and ANCOVA 
as appropriate. The time to event analyses may have been influenced by informative censoring (e.g. 
non-CHD death in the primary analysis, or UA related treatment changes in the secondary endpoints). 
However, as time to MACE-plus with all-cause death is virtually the same as the primary endpoint and the 
prevalence of hospitalisation due to UA is relatively low compared to the harder endpoints in the primary 
composite, informative censoring is not considered to have had a major impact on the study results. The 
interim analysis plan and handling of multiplicity are considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data  
The study screened 35437 patients, with a number of 16513 patients who failed screening. Consequently, 
18924 patients could be randomised and were almost all treated with study drug. A lower number of 
alirocumab treated patients completed the study treatment period compared to placebo (78% vs 84%), 
which can be explained by those patients that achieved very low levels of LDL-C (n=730; 7.7%). These 
patients rolled over to the placebo group in a blinded manner. A similar number of discontinuations due 
to AEs were observed (3.8% and 3.7%, respectively, for alirocumab vs placebo). Randomisation was 
successful as can be expected from a study this size.  
The patients included were on average 58 years of age, primarily male, primarily of white origin and 
approximately half were treated in Europe. About 34% already had a history of CAD. They had a history 
of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with a median time for ACS until randomisation of 3.6 months, 
resulting in a population at high risk for a CV event. These could be sub-categorised for 34.6% with 
STEMI, 48.6% with NSTEMI and 16.8% with UA. Several other risk factors also contributed to the 
increased CV risk of the patients including hypertension (64.7%), family history of CAD (35.8%), type 2 
diabetes (24.4%) or other cardiovascular diseases (21.1%) including congestive heart failure, PAD 
and/or stroke. The number of patients over 75 years of age was limited (n=1007). 
At the qualifying visit 99.5% had elevated lipid levels, mainly identified by LDL-C, with only 8% identified 
by Apo B (0.3% only on Apo B) and/or non-HDL-C (7.2% only on non-HDL-C). Of relevance, 19.8% 
(n=3715) of the patients had a LDL-C <70 mg/dL (<1.81 mmol/L) at baseline. According to the MAH, this 
proportion was higher than that observed at the qualifying visit (about 8%) and is likely explained by 
variability of LDL-C within individuals over short periods of time. As a result this means that 11.8% were 
not qualified to be included in the study at the qualification visit. 
A substantial number of 88.8% of the patients received a high dose of statins at randomisation. Only 
8.5% was on low to a moderate dose of statin and 2.4% was not on a statin. The most frequent reasons 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 54/101 
 
  
 
 
 
for not taking statin were “Subject unable to tolerate 2 different statins” (n=304) and “Muscle symptoms 
and/or CPK increase while taking statin” (n=274). There appears some overlap between both categories; 
for 157 both reasons were given. Only one-third (32.6%) of patients who were randomized in the study 
were treated with statin for at least 3 months prior to the index ACS event, which may indicate that the 
others were not well treated before recruitment in the study, since dyslipidaemia prior to the run-in period 
was reported in 66.7% of the patients. 
The largest proportion of patients were treated with the 75 mg Q2W dose, while 27.7% were uptitrated 
to the 150 mg Q2W dose and of these 8.5% was subsequently downtitrated. Of the alirocumab treated 
patients 7.7% switched to placebo between months 4-12 due to very low LDL-C levels.  
The recruitment procedure can be considered acceptable. The applicant has sufficiently described the 
amendments made in the protocol and the statistical analysis plan during the study. This is acceptable. 
The ITT population included all patients who were randomised. For the safety population only 30 of the 
randomised patients were not included. Also, the population with anti-alirocumab antibody is mentioned. 
A significant beneficial treatment effect of alirocumab versus placebo could be observed after a mean of 
31 months of treatment on the composite primary endpoint (MACE-plus) of CHD death, non-fatal MI, fatal 
and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, or UA requiring hospitalisation with 149 less events that occurred in the 
alirocumab treated patients (903 [9.5%] vs 1052 [11.1%]) resulting in a 15% lower hazard ratio (HR of 
0.85 (95% CI 0.78, 0.93; p = 0.0003)) with the effect diverging at approximately 8 months onward. This 
effect is mostly accountable to the benefit on non-fatal MI (83 less events), while other components 
contributing to the effect in order of frequency were CHD death, stroke and UA requiring hospitalisation. 
The sensitivity analyses using tipping point analysis using different scenarios provided reassurance that 
the primary analysis was not influenced by missing data. Significant reductions of 14%, 27%, and 39% 
were observed in the risk of non-fatal MI, ischaemic stroke, and UA requiring hospitalisation. The 
hierarchical testing of secondary composite endpoints showed a significantly consistent 12-14% 
reduction in composite of any CHD event (major CHD event, UA requiring hospitalization, ischemia-driven 
coronary revascularization procedure), any major CHD event (CHD death, non-fatal MI), any CV event 
(any non-fatal CHD event, any CV death, and non-fatal ischemic stroke), and CHMP guideline 
recommended composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. 
Reassuring is that also a reduction in CHD deaths and CV deaths were found, although these were not 
significantly reduced; the hierarchical testing was violated at the CHD deaths endpoint. Although the 
hierarchical testing was already violated, a significant reduction in all-cause death was found. No 
particular pattern could be observed for the type of non-CV-deaths. 
The lipid lowering reduction was also evaluated and showed a substantial decrease of -55.8% at month 4 
on LDL-C from a mean baseline level of 92.4 mg/dL (2.39 mmol/L). The effect diminished over time to a 
level of -39.9% at month 48. This was likely to treatment discontinuation and patients switching to 
placebo treatment because of very low levels of LDL-C. The on-treatment effect of LDL-C lowering was 
maintained throughout the study. Similar patterns were observed for ApoB and non-HDL-C. 
A consistent beneficial effect for alirocumab on the primary endpoint was observed according to 
subgroups analysed except for the subgroup of Asia region and Asian race subgroups. Within subgroup 
types of BMI, age, baseline apoB, baseline Lp(a), and baseline fasting TG, an expected greater relative 
and absolute treatment effect according to higher baseline risk was found. For subgroups of time from 
ACS, diabetes, baseline LDL-C, REACH score, and TIMI score this was less clear with a greater absolute 
risk reduction but not corresponding relative risk reduction according to higher baseline risk. The baseline 
statin use showed consistent results with lowest absolute and relative effect for high dose statin use. The 
applicant provided some additional considerations on the subgroup of patients with baseline LDL-C ≥100 
mg/dL, which as expected demonstrated a larger effect than the observed overall effect and obviously 
those with lower baseline LDL-C levels. A relatively low number of patients with anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 55/101 
 
  
 
 
 
response was observed (5.5.% vs 1.6%) for alirocumab vs placebo, respectively, with even lower rates 
for persistent ADA responses (0.7% vs 0.4%). No substantial diverging treatment effect was observed for 
these patients. 
Additional analyses 
A further analysis of the relation between LDL-C (categories) and CV risk reduction showed an effect of a 
25% reduction per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C on the primary endpoint in keeping with the CTT 
Collaboration meta-analysis demonstrating a 22% reduction per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, although 
these data are presented in relative terms without any presentation of placebo background risk. 
Considering this continuum in CV risk reduction with low achieved lipid levels, it is of interest to what 
extent the current study data challenge current guideline recommendations. In this respect, results for 
patients treated in the study not meeting current guideline recommendation for lipid treatment are of 
interest. In the subgroup of patients with lower baseline levels than the current recommended level for 
treatment of < 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) including 1870 alirocumab patients and 1881 placebo patients, 
8.6% vs 9.6% experienced a primary MACE-plus event resulting in a HR of 0.90 (0.73 to 1.11), a 
beneficial effect only slightly less than the 0.84 (0.76 to 0.92) for the patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL 
(with no significant p for interaction). These data thus may further challenge the current target driven 
clinical practice guideline recommendations and provides further support for the statement as included in 
the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/CHMP/748108/2013, Rev. 3) previously only associated with statin therapy of “The relationship 
between LDL-C levels and CHD risk is present over a broad range of LDL levels. The dividing line between 
"normocholesterolaemia" and "hypercholesterolaemia" is arbitrary and in fact may be non-existent. 
Epidemiological data indicate a continuous increasing risk from very low to “normal” and high levels of 
LDL-C.”. 
In addition to the results provided by the CV outcome study ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, an analysis across the 
trials of the original dossier including a broader range of CV risk population estimated a comparable CV 
reduction of 15% (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.27), although the studies were not designed and powered 
to provide treatment effects of alirocumab on CV event reduction. Similar considerations apply to the 
previous LONG TERM study. 
A relatively low number of patients with anti-drug antibody (ADA) response was observed (5.5% vs 
1.6%) for alirocumab vs placebo, respectively, with even lower rates for persistent ADA responses (0.7% 
vs 0.4%). No substantial diverging effect on the treatment effect was observed for these patients. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted the results for the large outcome study ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, a multicentre, 
international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study including patients with 
recent acute coronary syndrome, with additionally some other CV risk factors, demonstrating a significant 
effect on a composite endpoint of time to coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, fatal and 
non-fatal stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation when treated with alirocumab 75 mg Q2W 
with possible uptitration to 150 mg Q2W after 2 months on top of optimal lipid lowering therapy versus 
background therapy (placebo arm). This was generally supported with a consistent effect across several 
secondary endpoints, although the hierarchical testing was lost for CHD death, CV death and overall 
mortality. Also a consistent effect was generally observed across subgroups including patients already at 
very low LDL-C levels who can currently not be identified based on the current approved indication.

2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The pre-specified statistical analysis plan considered 3 tiers of AEs.  
• 
• 
• 
Tier 1 represents TEAEs for which hypotheses and a comprehensive analytical approach were 
prospectively defined.  
Tier 2 represents common TEAEs (not pre-specified) and thus TEAEs for which the prior probability is 
low that these represent adverse reactions. The approach to Tier 2 was based on the use of statistical 
tests to screen TEAEs which are then assessed clinically.  
Tier 3 represents infrequent TEAEs which are assessed clinically. The final output is represented in a 
series of conclusions that identify ADRs to inform product labelling and future pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
Data Monitoring Committee 
A data monitoring committee (DMC) composed of members who were independent from the Sponsor and 
the study Investigators, was implemented in order to monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews 
of accumulated safety data that were unblinded. During their periodic reviews of safety data throughout 
the study, the CV DMC also analyzed the aggregate safety data for patients who achieved LDL-C 
<25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) and more particularly, reviewed AEs potentially associated with LDL-C 
<25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L).  
An external physician, independent from the Sponsor and the Investigator sites (called the “Independent 
Physician”), was in charge of monitoring the safety of patients with low LDL-C through the review of the 
unblinded safety data of patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) and more 
particularly, AEs predefined as potentially associated with LDL-C <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L). One of the 
objectives of this review, done throughout the study, was to allow the CV DMC to get further information 
in addition to the aggregate safety data for these patients at the time of their periodic reviews. 
Neurocognitive Expert Panel 
An independent Neurocognitive Expert Panel (NCEP) composed of 3 clinicians with experience in the 
management/assessment of patients with neurocognitive impairment was implemented to review in a 
blinded fashion and on an ongoing basis, all neurocognitive AEs reported during the study. As planned the 
NCEP prepared an interim assessment based on the blinded review of all neurocognitive AEs before 
database lock. This assessment provides their expert opinion on the likeliness that in the study, patients' 
cognitive function had been altered or not independent of confounding factors. Then once the database 
was locked a final report was issued based on the knowledge of the treatment assigned for each patient 
and provides their conclusion on a potential neurocognitive signal associated with the administration of 
alirocumab.  
Diabetes Expert Panel 
An Independent Diabetes Expert Panel (DEP) composed of 3 clinicians with experience in the 
management/assessment of patients with diabetes, was implemented during the course of the trial, to 
review in a blinded fashion, potential cases of diabetes only identified as “diabetes” through the use of 
anti-diabetic medication reported before, at baseline or after baseline.  
In addition, 2 other committees were implemented in the study, a Steering Committee that was in charge 
to provide the Sponsor with scientific and strategic direction for the study and had the overall 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 57/101 
 
  
 
 
 
responsibility for its execution, and a Clinical Events Committee responsible for defining, validating, and 
classifying, in a blinded fashion, all suspected CV events that were to be reported. 
Patient exposure 
In the safety population, the median duration of treatment exposure was 30.90 months for the 
alirocumab group and 31.80 months for the placebo group. In the alirocumab group a total of 8071 
(87%) patients were exposed for ≥12 months, 7248 (78%) patients for ≥24 months, 3105 (33%) for 
≥36 months, and 555 (6%) for ≥48 months.  
The cumulative exposure to alirocumab (23 061.8 patient-years) was slightly lower as compared to that 
of placebo (24 234.4 patient-years) due to 730 (7.7%) patients in the alirocumab group who were 
switched to placebo due to 2 consecutive LDL-C <15 mg/dL (<0.39 mmol/L). 
Of the 9451 patients randomized and treated in the alirocumab group, 2615 (27.7%) had their dose 
up-titrated to 150 mg. Of these 2615 patients, 805 (8.5% of the total number of patients) had their dose 
subsequently down-titrated to 75 mg. A total of 730 (7.7%) patients randomized and treated in the 
alirocumab group were switched to placebo, most of them between 4 to 12 months after initiation of 
treatment with alirocumab. In the alirocumab group, cumulative exposures to alirocumab 75 mg and 
150 mg were 17 948.4 and 5113.5 patient-years, respectively.

The TEAE period was defined as the time from the first dose of double-blind IMP injection up to the day of 
the last dose of double-blind IMP injection +70 days (10 weeks) as concentrations of alirocumab could 
generally be measured until 10 weeks after the discontinuation of double-blind IMP injection. For patients 
with last contact date within 70 days after the last dose of IMP, the TEAE period was up to the last contact 
date. 
The percentages of patients who experienced TEAEs, treatment-emergent serious adverse event (SAE), 
and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were comparable between treatment groups (see Table 
20 below).

The only TEAE (preferred term [PT] level) with an incidence of ≥2% in the alirocumab group and a ≥0.5% 
difference compared with the placebo group was injection site reaction (3.8% vs 2.1%). 
The following TEAEs (PT level) with an incidence of ≥2% in the placebo group and a ≥0.5% difference 
compared with the alirocumab group in order of decreasing frequency were: angina pectoris (4.5% 
versus 5.0% in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively), accidental overdose (3.7% versus 
4.4%), dizziness (3.6% versus 4.1%), and anxiety (1.7% versus 2.4%). 
The Tier 2 analysis of TEAEs (“common TEAEs”) was conducted on TEAEs for which there were at least 6 
patients with an event overall in the safety population. TEAEs (PT or high level term [HLT]) identified as 
requiring further consideration by the Tier 2 analysis were those events reported in more than 1% of 
patients in either treatment group for which the lower bound of the 95% CI for the HR for alirocumab 
versus placebo was greater than 1. The only Tier 2 TEAE that met the criteria above was injection site 
reactions (HLT or PT); this TEAE was also an AESI. None of the other Tier 2 TEAEs meeting the criteria 
above were assessed as safety signals.

Extracted from 5.3.5.1 Study EFC11570 [Section 11.3.4.1] and [Table 42] to [Table 45], [Table 47] to [Table 51].  
Allergic events 
The incidence of general allergic TEAEs (based on a company MedDRA query (CMQ) for PTs potentially 
related to allergic events) was similar between alirocumab and placebo groups (7.9% versus 7.8%, 
respectively; 3.3 events versus 3.1 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.95 
to 1.17). 
The most frequently reported general allergic TEAEs (PTs reported in at least 0.5% of patients in any 
treatment group) were rash (1.2% in the alirocumab group versus 1.1% in the placebo group), pruritus 
(0.8% versus 0.7%), asthma (0.6% each), eczema (0.5% versus 0.6%), and conjunctivitis (0.4% versus 
0.5%). Among the patients who experienced general allergic TEAEs, the majority reported mild events in 
intensity (61.1% and 61.3% in the alirocumab or placebo groups, respectively) or moderate events in 
intensity (33.0% and 32.5%, respectively). No difference was identified in the outcome of general allergic 
TEAEs between the alirocumab and placebo groups with a majority of patients having recovered from the 
general allergic TEAE (79.4% in the alirocumab group and 74.6% in the placebo group, respectively). 
Based on the above CMQ, serious general allergic TEAEs were reported by 0.8% of patients in the 
alirocumab group and 0.9% of patients in the placebo group. General allergic TEAEs with a fatal outcome 
were reported in 8 patients (<0.1%) in the alirocumab group and 9 patients (<0.1%) in the placebo 
group. In most of the patients (7 and 8 in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively) death was 
due to respiratory failure in the context of serious concomitant disease and unlikely to be allergic in 
nature. The remaining patient in the alirocumab group had a medical history of asthma and died from an 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 61/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
asthma crisis without a triggering factor. The remaining patient in the placebo group patient died from 
"choked on food". 
General allergic TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% of patients in both groups. In the 
alirocumab group, general allergic TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were mainly 
reported as: rash, dermatitis allergic, hypersensitivity, and urticaria. In the placebo group, TEAE leading 
to permanent treatment discontinuation were most often reported as dermatitis allergic, hypersensitivity, 
and acute respiratory failure. 
Local injection site reactions 
The incidence of local injection site reactions (according to the AE category as per e-CRF) was higher in 
the alirocumab group compared to the placebo group (3.8% versus 2.1%, respectively; 1.6 events versus 
0.8 events per 100 patient-years; HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.17). Most local injection site reactions 
occurred before Month 12 in both treatment groups. 
Most patients who experienced a local injection site reaction TEAE had a single episode (70.8% of patients 
in the alirocumab group and 80.8% in the placebo group). The majority of events were mild or moderate 
in intensity. Local injection site reaction TEAEs with a severe intensity were reported in 1.1% and 0.5% of 
patients who reported local injection site reactions in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
Most local injection site reaction TEAEs were transient (median duration of 6 and 8 days in the alirocumab 
and placebo groups, respectively) and almost all patients recovered. 
The most frequent symptoms associated with local injection site reactions (by decreasing order in the 
alirocumab group) were erythema/redness (2.1% of patients in the alirocumab group versus 0.7% in the 
placebo group), swelling (1.5% versus 0.7%), pain (1.5% versus 0.8%), tenderness (1.3% versus 
0.6%), and itching (1.3% versus 0.4%). 
Serious local injection site reactions were reported in 3 (<0.1%) patients in the alirocumab group and 
none in the placebo group. All recovered. Local injection site reactions led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation in 0.3% of patients in the alirocumab and <0.1% of patients in the placebo group.  
A higher proportion of the ADA-positive patients experienced injection site reactions compared with 
ADA-negative patients (7.5% of ADA positive patients versus 3.6% of ADA-negative patients). 
Hemolytic anaemia 
Although confirmed hemolytic anemia was an AESI, it was reported in less than 6 patients overall and, 
accordingly, was evaluated as a Tier 3 event. 
Confirmed hemolytic anemia was reported in 3 patients in the alirocumab group and in 1 patient of the 
placebo group. None of the 3 cases of hemolytic anemia reported in the alirocumab group were 
considered related. 
None of the patients with hemolytic anemia had concomitant low LDL-C (<25 mg/dL). 
Neurologic events 
Overall, the percentages of patients who reported neurologic events of interest during the TEAE period 
were similar between alirocumab and placebo groups (4.0% versus 4.4%, respectively, 1.6 events 
versus 1.7 events per 100 patient-years, HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.06).  
Among patients who experienced neurologic events, the majority reported mild (62.1% and 62.9% in the 
alirocumab or placebo groups, respectively) or moderate events (34.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Only 
a small proportion of patients with neurologic TEAEs reported a severe event (3.5% and 3.3%, 
respectively).  
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 62/101 
 
  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported neurologic events (PTs reported in at least 0.5% of patients in any 
treatment group) were hypoesthesia (alirocumab: 1.0% versus placebo: 0.9%), paresthesia (0.9% 
versus 1.1%), and muscular weakness (0.5% versus 0.4%).  
Serious neurologic TEAEs were reported in 0.3% of patients in the alirocumab group and 0.4% of patients 
in the placebo group. No fatal case was reported. Few patients (<0.1% of patients in each group) 
discontinued study treatment due to a neurologic TEAE.  
Neurocognitive events 
Based on the CMQ defined by the Sponsor, the incidence of neurocognitive events was similar between 
alirocumab and placebo groups (1.5% versus 1.8%, respectively; 0.6 events versus 0.7 events per 100 
patient-years, HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.11). 
On the basis of the grouping of terms recommended by the FDA, neurocognitive events were reported in 
similar incidences: 1.4% of patients in the alirocumab and 1.6% of patients in the placebo group, 
respectively; 0.6 event per 100 patient-years in each treatment group; HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.17). 
Among patients who experienced neurocognitive TEAEs, the majority reported events mild in intensity 
and few were reported as severe in intensity (5.6% in the alirocumab group and 4.8% in the placebo 
group). No difference was identified in the outcome of neurocognitive TEAEs between the alirocumab and 
placebo groups, and approximately half of the patients in both treatment groups recovered from these 
events. 
Confusional state (PT) was detected as an event reported in a higher number of patients in the alirocumab 
group (0.2%) as compared to the placebo group (<0.1%) in the Tier 2 analysis. During their blinded 
review of these cases, the independent NCEP panel found an alternative cause in all but one event of 
confusional state, reported in the alirocumab group indicating the lack of evidence for a potential signal of 
confusional state associated with alirocumab. 
Serious neurocognitive TEAEs were reported in 0.2% of patients in both groups. One (<0.1%) patient in 
the alirocumab group and 3 (<0.1%) patients in the placebo group had a neurocognitive TEAE leading to 
death. Review of individual cases identified pre-existing medical history explaining the cause of death. A 
total of 0.1% and 0.2% of patients in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively, permanently 
discontinued study treatment due to a neurocognitive TEAE. 
Hepatic disorders 
The incidence of hepatic disorder TEAEs was similar between the alirocumab group and the placebo group 
(5.3% versus 5.7%, 2.2 events per 100 patient-years in both groups; HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.09). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the hepatic disorders standardized MedDRA query  
(PTs reported in at least 0.5% of patients in any treatment group) were alanine aminotransferase 
increased (1.4% in the alirocumab group versus 1.8% in the placebo group), hepatic steatosis (0.8% 
versus 1.0%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (0.7% versus 0.7%), and potential drug-induced 
liver injury (0.6% versus 0.4%). 
Drug-induced liver injury was the PT used to encode any verbatim term that attributed a drug as the 
cause of the elevation of liver enzymes, regardless of the magnitude of the elevation and whatever the 
drug (eg, IMP or statin). In all patients with TEAEs coded to the PT drug-induced liver injury assessed by 
the Investigators as possibly related to the IMP in the alirocumab group, alternative causes, most often 
statin therapy, were identified. The imbalance in the incidence of TEAEs coded to the PT drug-induced 
liver injury should be reviewed in combination with the other events pertaining to the hepatic disorders 
standardized MedDRA query and to changes in liver enzymes (potentially clinically significant 
abnormality) that showed no difference between alirocumab and the placebo. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 63/101 
 
  
 
 
 
Potential Hy’s law cases were reported at low and similar incidences in the alirocumab and the placebo 
group (0.2% each). Alternative causes of potential Hy’s law, other than statin therapy, were identified in 
all but 1 patient in the alirocumab group in whom the potential Hy’s law was detected at the end of study 
visit and no follow-up was reported. 
Serious hepatic disorder TEAEs were reported in 0.6% of patients in both treatment groups. There were 
3 and 4 fatal cases reported in the alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively (<0.1% for both). Hepatic 
disorder TEAEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.4% and 0.3% of patients in the 
alirocumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
Diabetes mellitus 
Diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications in patients regardless of their diabetes status at baseline 
The incidence of diabetes mellitus or diabetic complication TEAEs in patients regardless of their diabetes 
status at baseline was similar between the alirocumab and placebo groups (8.7% versus 9.8%, 
respectively; 3.6 versus 3.9 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.01).  
Diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications TEAEs in patients with diabetes at baseline 
In patients with diabetes at baseline, the incidence of diabetes mellitus or diabetic complication TEAEs 
was similar between alirocumab and placebo groups (18.8% versus 21.2%; 8.9 versus 9.7 events per 
100 patient-years; HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.03). 
Analysis of the cumulative incidences of diabetes mellitus or diabetic complication TEAEs over time 
showed similar trend between the alirocumab and the placebo groups. 
New onset of diabetes mellitus in patients with no diabetes at baseline 
New onset of diabetes analysis combined information from TEAEs, antidiabetic medications with a 
confirmed diagnosis per the external diabetes experts and laboratory parameters (HbA1c and fasting 
glucose). 
In patients with no diabetes at baseline (including normoglycemic patients and pre-diabetes patients at 
baseline), the incidence of new onset of diabetes (NOD) during the TEAE period was similar between 
alirocumab and placebo groups (9.6% versus 10.1%, respectively; 4.0 events per 100 patient-years in 
both treatment groups; HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.11). 
The incidence of NOD in the patients with prediabetes was 13.8% versus 15.0% in the alirocumab and 
placebo groups, respectively (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.09). As expected, the incidence of NOD during 
the TEAE period in normoglycemic patients was much lower (3.0% in the alirocumab group and 2.4% in 
the placebo group; HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.79). 
Cataract 
The incidence of cataract TEAEs was similar between alirocumab and placebo groups (1.3% and 1.4%, 
respectively, 0.5 events per 100 patient-years in each treatment group; HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.20).  
Other adverse events 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
Adverse events in the musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC were reported with similar 
incidences in both groups: 2406 (25.5%) patients in the alirocumab group and 2385 (25.3%) patients in 
the placebo group. Serious AEs in this SOC were reported in 205 (2.2%) patients in the alirocumab group 
and in 209 (2.2%) patients in the placebo group. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 64/101 
 
  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (PT ≥1.0%) were myalgia (alirocumab: 5.6% versus placebo: 
5.3%), back pain (4.3% versus 4.2%), arthralgia (3.9% versus 3.7%), pain in extremity (3.1% versus 
3.2%), muscle spasms (2.3% versus 2.1%), osteoarthritis (2.2% in both groups), musculoskeletal pain 
(1.9% versus 2.3%) and musculoskeletal chest pain (1.1% versus 1.4%). 
Renal adverse events 
Adverse events in the renal and urinary disorders SOC were reported in 668 (7.1%) patients in the 
alirocumab group and in 696 (7.4%) patients in the placebo group. Serious AEs in the renal and urinary 
disorders SOC were reported in 144 (1.5%) patients in the alirocumab group and in 165 (1.7%) patients 
in the placebo group. 
The most frequently reported AEs (PT ≥1.0%) were acute kidney injury (1.1% in the alirocumab group 
versus 1.5% in the placebo group), chronic kidney disease (1.0% in both groups) and nephrolithiasis 
(0.8% versus 1.1%, respectively). 
Adverse events in patients treated with alirocumab with 2 consecutive LDL-C < 25 mg/dL 
(0.65 mmol/L) and LDL-C < 15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L) 
In the overall population, as described above, analyses by treatment group showed no differences 
between alirocumab and placebo groups for neurologic events, neurocognitive events, NOD, or cataract  
TEAEs. These data do not indicate a direct effect of alirocumab on these events. The evaluation of the 
potential relationship of achieving low LDL-C levels with occurrence of certain AEs is presented below.  
All analyses related to low LDL-C should be interpreted with caution given the major limitation of the 
comparison between post-randomization subgroups. To attempt to reduce the bias introduced by this 
limitation, adjustment on prognostic factors for each event was done in the second step analysis. The list 
of prognostic factors was determined based on literature review and expert discussion for validation. 
However, bias due to unmeasured or unknown factors cannot be adjusted. 
No signal was identified in the screening approach that was judged to require further analysis in the 
second step. Therefore, the second step analysis focused only on the prespecified events (neurological 
events, neurocognitive events, NOD, and cataract) adjusted on prognostic factors of each event. For all 
these events, analyses were performed on 3 observation periods: 
•  The low LDL-C period per SAP applied for patients with 2 consecutive low LDL-C (<25 mg/dL and 
<15 mg/dL) using the period starting from the date of the first low LDL-C up to the last 
alirocumab 150 mg injection +70 days if patient was on 150 mg or up to the last alirocumab 
injection +70 days if patient was on 75 mg. For patients without 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 
mg/dL (or 15 mg/dL), the analysis period was the TEAE period. For NOD, as discussed further 
below, this prespecified approach introduced a strong bias due to the fact that the vast majority 
of NODs were detected by laboratory parameters (HbA1c and fasting glucose) that were 
infrequently assessed during the study.  
•  The TEAE period from the first injection to the last alirocumab injection +70 days for both patients 
with or without 2 consecutive low LDL-C values. 
•  The extended TEAE period: from the first injection to the last IMP injection (alirocumab or placebo 
in case of switch) +70 days for both patients with or without 2 consecutive low LDL-C values to 
allow a longer follow-up for patients switched to placebo due to 2 consecutive LDL-C <15 mg/dL 
(0.39 mmol/L). 
Overall, there were comparable frequencies for AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to death and AEs leading to 
permanent treatment discontinuation in patients who achieved two consecutive LDL-C levels <25mg/dL 
(or <15 mg/dL, respectively), compared to the subgroup of alirocumab-treated patients who did not.

Neurologic events 
The adjusted analyses on the different observation periods were consistent and did not show any 
difference in the rate of neurologic events between alirocumab-treated patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C 
<25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) (or <15 mg/dL [0.39 mmol/L]) and alirocumab-treated patients without these 
low LDL-C levels.

The adjusted analyses on the different observation periods did not show consistent differences in the rate 
of neurocognitive events between alirocumab-treated patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C <25 mg/dL 
(0.65 mmol/L) and alirocumab-treated patients without these low LDL-C values. Very few events were 
reported in the patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C values <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L), resulting in 
variations of the estimated HR (some higher than 1; some lower than 1) among different analysis periods. 
Moreover, consistent with there being few events, there were wide CIs around these HRs.

New onset diabetes 
Two step approaches were applied for the prespecified events, including NOD. 
The prespecified first step - second screening approach analysis that compared alirocumab versus 
placebo according to categories based on baseline LDL-C showed no differences between the 2 treatment 
groups across the 5 categories, with HR point estimates close to 1. In particular a HR<1 was observed in 
the 2 lowest categories, ie, baseline LDL-C <70 mg/dL and baseline LDL-C ≥70 to <90 mg/dL. In the 
lowest category of baseline LDL-C <70 mg/dL, the incidence of NOD was 12.6% in the placebo group as 
compared to 9.6% in the alirocumab group. 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 68/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Contrary to neurological, neurocognitive, and cataract events that were detected through AE reporting, 
NODs were detected from AEs, laboratory parameters (HbA1c and fasting glucose), and initiation of 
antidiabetic medications. After results became available, it was observed that the vast majority of NODs 
were detected through laboratory parameters, and more particularly HbA1c.  
In most cases, even when diabetes was reported as AE, the onset date was concomitant to the 
measurement of laboratory parameters. Measurements of HbA1c and fasting glucose were yearly 
assessments with the first measurement performed at Month 12. 
Therefore, the low LDL-C period as per the SAP was associated with a decrease of the time period where 
the patients were at risk of an event and with an increase of the rate in patient-years. Because of this 
major bias, the calculated incidence of NOD in patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C values <15 mg/dL (0.39 
mmol/L) as compared with patients without such levels was considered unreliable. 
Over the TEAE and extended TEAE periods, the calculated incidence of NOD in patients with 2 consecutive 
LDL-C <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L), as compared with patients without such levels showed estimated HRs 
slightly above 1. Higher HRs were observed in patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C <15 mg/dL (0.39 
mmol/L). It should be noted that this analysis has the limitation of any comparison of post-randomization 
subgroups. Despite adjustment on prognostic factors for NOD, remaining confounders cannot be ruled 
out. 
Table 29: Second step: Number (%) of patients with new onset of diabetes and hazard ratio 
according to LDL-C level (25 and 15 mg/dL, 0.65 and 0.39 mmol/L) adjusted on prognostic 
factors - Safety population - Alirocumab treated patients 
To further explore any relationship between NOD and low LDL-C, 2 post-hoc analyses were conducted: 
•  A post-hoc propensity matching analysis. This analysis was done to assess the risk of developing 
NOD in alirocumab patients who achieved 2 consecutive LDL-C <15 mg/dL compared to placebo 
patients matched to these alirocumab patients based on baseline characteristics that predict a 
predisposition to achieving 2 consecutive LDL-C <15 mg/dL. This analysis intended to identify 
placebo-treated patients that likely would have achieved low LDL-C levels if they were exposed to 
alirocumab (matching done between 3 non-diabetic placebo patients and 1 non-diabetic 
alirocumab patient). 
The comparison was adjusted on between-group baseline differences in prognostic factors of 
NOD. The analysis showed a HR of 1.09 (0.83 to 1.42). This analysis has also the limitations 
inherent to the limited number of baseline factors that were used to match with the placebo 
patients. Despite the adjustment on prognostic factors for NOD, remaining confounders cannot 
be ruled out.

Safety population - Patients with no diabetes at baseline - Comparison of patients with 2 
consecutive LDL-C <15 mg/dL to propensity-matched placebo patients 
•  A post-hoc analysis of NOD similar to the analysis published in the FOURIER study. In this 
analysis, adjusted on prognostic factors for NOD, no differences across the 5 groups based on 
LDL-C levels at Month 1 were observed. In particular, similar results were observed for the 
subgroup of patients with achieved LDL-C <20 mg/dL compared to the subgroup of patients with 
achieved LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL at Month 1 used as the reference subgroup (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.80 
to 1.34). In addition to the limitation of comparing post-randomization subgroups, this analysis 
might be less sensitive than the analyses described above due to the categorization of patients 
based on a single value and the use of a higher threshold (20 mg/dL instead of 15 mg/dL); 
however, it has been performed to have a better comparison to the published data from another 
PCSK9 inhibitor.

Cataract

Page 70/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the alirocumab group, the number of cataracts per 100 patient-years in patients with 2 consecutive 
LDL-C values <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) was higher than those who did not have 2 consecutive LDL-C 
values <25 mg/dL. In patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C values <15 mg/dL (0.39 mmol/L), very few 
cataracts were reported, resulting in variations of the estimated HR, however consistently above 1, across 
the different analysis periods with wide CIs. These analyses could also still be biased by the comparison 
of post-randomization subgroups since the prognostic factors of cataract were not all accounted for in the 
analysis as some were not collected in the database (eg, funduscopic evidence of large Drusen, iris color, 
sunlight exposure, or waist circumference).

Adverse drug reactions 
To identify ADRs from the alirocumab clinical data, a tier-based approach was utilized similar to that used 
for the original dossier. For Tier 1 TEAEs, hypotheses and a comprehensive analytical approach were 
prospectively defined. For Tier 2, common TEAEs (not prespecified) were evaluated. These are TEAEs for 
which the prior probability was low that an individual term would represent an adverse reaction. The 
approach to these common TEAEs is based on the use of statistical tests to screen TEAEs which were then 
assessed clinically. Tier 3 corresponds to infrequent TEAEs for which descriptive analyses only were 
performed. 
In the original submission, the following ADRs were identified for alirocumab: injection site reactions, 
hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity vasculitis, upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, pruritus, 
urticaria, and eczema nummular. 
In the OUTCOMES study, the only TEAE identified as an ADR was injection site reactions reported at a 
slightly higher rate with alirocumab as compared to placebo (3.8% versus 2.1%). This ADR was 
previously identified in the original submission.  
For general allergic TEAEs (based on a CMQ for PTs potentially related to allergic events), no event (at PT 
level) was detected as a potential signal with alirocumab as compared to the placebo through the Tier 2 
analysis. The rare and sometimes serious allergic events identified as ADRs in the original submission, 
were reported at similar incidence in the alirocumab and placebo groups in the OUTCOMES study: pruritus 
(alirocumab group: 0.8%; versus placebo group: 0.7%), urticaria (0.4% versus 0.3%), eczema 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 71/101 
 
  
 
 
 
 
nummular (<0.1% in both groups), hypersensitivity (0.2% in both groups) and hypersensitivity vasculitis 
(0 versus < 0.1%). In summary, the analysis of TEAEs pertaining to the general allergic TEAEs grouping 
has not revealed any new safety signal in the OUTCOMES study.  
Analysis of neurologic events overall (AESI) or at event level (PT) did not reveal any difference between 
the treatment groups that would indicate that one of these neurologic events is an ADR. 
Neurocognitive TEAEs were reported at comparable rates in the alirocumab and the placebo groups. 
Confusional state (PT) was an event detected through the Tier 2 analysis, however based on the findings 
of the independent NCEP during their blinded review, this event is not considered as ADR. 
Hepatic disorder TEAEs were reported at comparable rates in the alirocumab and the placebo groups. 
TEAEs coded to the PT drug-induced liver injury (PT) and gallbladder polyp (PT) were detected through 
the Tier 2 analysis but the clinical conclusion based on the review of the cases was that there was no 
clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups. The analysis of the events pertaining to 
the hepatic disorders SMQ and the results of liver enzymes including PCSA analyses, do not indicate that 
the administration of alirocumab could be associated with a signal on hepatic disorders. Thus, no hepatic 
disorder is considered as ADR. 
Diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications in patients with diabetes at baseline were reported at 
comparable rates in the alirocumab and the placebo groups. Review of all TEAEs at PT level did not reveal 
any differences between treatment groups.  
NOD were reported at comparable rates in the alirocumab and the placebo groups. Additionally, the 
changes over time in mean HbA1c and fasting glucose were similar in the alirocumab and the placebo 
groups, overall. Analysis according to diabetes status at baseline showed no meaningful changes in mean 
HbA1c (%) and mean fasting glucose, in patients with no diabetes at baseline (normoglycemic or with 
pre-diabetes at baseline).  
Cataract conditions (HLT) were reported in comparable number of patients in the alirocumab and the 
placebo groups.  
In summary, no new ADRs other than those already known were identified in the OUTCOMES study. 
Overdose with the IMP 
Overall, 3.3% of patients in the alirocumab group versus 4.0% of patients in the placebo group were 
reported to have had an overdose with the IMP. 
Overdoses with the IMP (alirocumab or placebo) were asymptomatic and accidental in the majority of 
patients. Two patients in the alirocumab and in the placebo groups each reported symptomatic overdose. 
In the 2 patients in the alirocumab group who reported symptomatic overdose, one reported injection site 
reaction, and the other one reported a nonserious, moderate muscular weakness concomitant with the 
overdose  but  which  was  assessed  as  not  related  to  the  IMP  by  the  Investigator.  Five  patients  in  the 
alirocumab and 8 patients in the placebo group reported intentional overdose with the IMP. 
Pregnancy  
No pregnancies were reported in female participants. Pregnancies in partner’s participant were reported 
for 6 patients (<0.1%) in the alirocumab group versus 2 patients (<0.1%) in the placebo group. In the 7 
cases all pregnancies ended in normal delivery of healthy newborns (information provided by the 
partner). In the remaining case no further information was provided and it concerns the placebo group 
patient.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
The percentages of patients who experienced a treatment-emergent SAE were similar between 
alirocumab and placebo groups (23.3% versus 24.9%).  
There were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups for any individual SOC or PT. 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs (PT), ie, that occurred in ≥0.5% of patients in 
either the alirocumab or placebo groups are presented in Table 33.

Deaths 
Any death that occurred from randomization until CSED was not considered as AE but as an efficacy 
endpoint, and had to be submitted to the CEC for adjudication. However, when the cause of death could 
not be determined, the Investigator was also to report “Sudden Death” or “Undetermined cause of death” 
as an SAE.  
Overall 334 deaths (3.5%) in the alirocumab group and 392 (4.2%) deaths in the placebo group were 
reported during the course of the study until the CSED (oup and 1 in the placebo group). 
Table 34). For both components of all-cause death, CV death, and non-CV death, a lower frequency was 
observed in the alirocumab group (2.3% and 1.0%, respectively) as compared with the placebo group 
(2.6% and 1.3%, respectively). 
During the TEAE period, a total of 233 (2.5%) patients died in the alirocumab group and 273 (2.9%) 
patients in the placebo group. For the non-CV deaths, no differences were observed between alirocumab 
and placebo groups (0.6% in both groups). 
Deaths that occurred after the CSED and up to the clinical database lock were not adjudicated per 
protocol. A total of 13 (0.1%) deaths in the alirocumab group and 6 (<0.1%) deaths in the placebo group 
were reported after the CSED; among them 10 occurred during the TEAE period (5 [<0.1%] in each 
group) and 9 post-treatment (8 in the alirocumab group and 1 in the placebo group).

Laboratory findings 
No relevant abnormalities were identified on review of all laboratory assessments. 
HbA1c 
Analysis according to diabetes status at baseline showed that in patients with no diabetes at baseline, no 
meaningful changes from baseline in mean HbA1c were observed during the treatment period in either 
treatment group: the mean increase in HbA1c from baseline at Month 36 was +0.20% and +0.19%, in 
the alirocumab and the placebo groups, respectively, for patients normoglycemic at baseline, and 
+0.09% and +0.14%, in the 2 groups, respectively, for patients with pre-diabetes at baseline. In patients 
with diabetes at baseline, mean HbA1c tended to increase over time; however, with a similar magnitude 
in both treatment groups at +0.34% and +0.36%, in the alirocumab and the placebo groups respectively, 
at Month 36. 
Renal function parameters 
No treatment group differences were observed in the number of patients with PCSAs for renal function 
parameters during the TEAE period regardless of baseline status.

Liver enzymes 
Increases in ALT meeting these pre-specified criteria were reported in the TEAE period for 221 (2.4%) 
patients in the alirocumab group compared with 234 (2.5%) patients in the placebo group. No treatment 
group differences were observed in the number of patients with PCSAs of liver function parameters at any 
time during the TEAE period, in particular ALT values >3 ULN were reported in 2.3% of patients in the 
alirocumab group and 2.4% of patients in the placebo group; ALT values >10 ULN were reported in 0.3% 
of patients in the alirocumab group and 0.2% in the placebo group. Combination of ALT>3 ULN with total 
bilirubin >2 ULN (potential Hy’s law case) was observed in 16 (0.2%) patients in the alirocumab group 
and 21 (0.2%) patients in the placebo group. In the 16 patients with potential Hy’s law cases in the 
alirocumab group, an alternative etiology was not identified in one patient. This case was reported at the 
end-of-treatment visit but follow-up was not obtained (Patient No. 011570-070-007-002). Similarly, in 
the 21 patients with potential Hy’s law case in the placebo group, alternative etiologies were identified in 
all but 3 patients (Patients 011570-356-057-024; 011570-616-008-042 and 011570-703-006-050).

CK levels 
Creatine kinase values >3 ULN were observed in 5.0% of patients in the alirocumab group versus 5.1% 
of patients in the placebo group, and values >10 ULN were observed in 0.5% of patients in each 
treatment group. 
Vital signs 
No meaningful changes in vital signs (DBP, SBP, HR and weight) were observed over time in any 
treatment group (see Table 37 below).

Safety in special populations 
Adverse events in patients with ADA response 
Treatment-emergent positive ADA assay responses were observed in 5.5% of patients in the alirocumab 
group and in 1.6% of patients in the placebo group. Most of the treatment-emergent ADA responses were 
classified as very low titer, transient responses, with only 0.7% and 0.4% of the patients experiencing 
persistent responses in the alirocumab group and the placebo group, respectively; the majority of these 
were also low titer responses. The incidence of NAb was very low, 0.5% in the alirocumab group and 
<0.1% in the placebo group, and mostly transient. 
In the alirocumab group, 78.6% of treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients and 76.2% of 
ADA-negative patients had at least 1 TEAE during the study. The safety profile in the ADA-positive 
patients was generally similar to that observed in the ADA-negative patients, with the exception of local 
injection site reaction with a higher frequency in the ADA-positive patients (7.5%) than in the 
ADA-negative patients (3.6%). Among the patients with a persistent ADA response, 10.4% had local 
injection site reactions. 
As identified in the original submission, the ADA positive response was not associated with any special 
pattern of TEAEs, except an increased rate of injection site reactions. 
Safety according to age 
Significant (p<0.10) interactions were measured between the treatment groups and age for local 
injection site reaction. A lower incidence of events in older patients was detected compared to youngest 
patients. There is no mechanism to explain this interaction. Within the limitations of a small sample size 
in the older age groups, in particular for very old patients, no age-related safety concern emerged across 
these 4 age groups.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentages of patients with TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were similar 
between the alirocumab and placebo groups (3.6% versus 3.4%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (PTs) leading to permanent treatment discontinuation that occurred 
in ≥0.2% of patients in either the alirocumab or placebo groups, respectively, were (by decreasing order 
in the alirocumab group): myalgia reported at the same incidence in both treatment groups (0.2%) and 
injection site reactions (0.2% in the alirocumab group versus <0.1% in the placebo group). 
Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, from 01-Jul-2015 to 30-Sep-2017, the worldwide sales represented 116.72 million mg of 
alirocumab (whatever the form) over this 27-month-period. Assuming a mean daily dose of 5.4 mg per 
day (World Health Organisation Defined Daily Dose), the number of patient days is estimated to be of 
21.61 million (number of milligrams divided by 5.4), and the number of patient-years to be of 59 216 
cumulatively (number of patient-day divided by 365). 
Based on the information collected and analyzed during the post-marketing period through 30-Sep-2017, 
the Sponsor added influenza-like illness to its Company Core Data Sheet as having been reported with 
post-marketing use and is updating its labeling worldwide accordingly. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In this long term cardiovascular outcome study patients were treated for a mean period of 31 months with 
alirocumab (background lipid lowering therapy) including 8071 (87%) patients exposed for ≥12 months, 
7248 (78%) patients for ≥24 months, 3105 (33%) for ≥36 months, and 555 (6%) for ≥48 months. This 
is substantially longer than the treatment periods obtained in the original MAA. A slightly higher 
cumulative exposure in the placebo group was seen which could be clarified by the fact that some patients 
(n=730; 7.7%) from the alirocumab were switched to placebo due to very low LDL-C levels as per 
protocol. A proportion of 27.7% of the patients (2615) were uptitrated to the 150 mg, and of these 
patients 805 (8.5%) patients were subsequently downtitrated. In the presentation of the adverse events, 
generally, no distinction between both doses in presentation has been made. As in the original dossier no 
different pattern in AEs has been observed between both doses. 
Although AEs were commonly reported, these were approximately similar between the alirocumab and 
placebo group (75.8% vs 77.1%). Also the serious AEs were reported in a similar frequency (23.3% vs 
24.9%). The drug was generally well tolerated as the percentage of patients who discontinued due to AEs 
was relatively low and occurred in a comparable frequency in both groups (3.6% versus 3.4%).  
The most common AE reported more for alirocumab than placebo (≥0.5% difference) was injection site 
reaction (3.8% vs 2.1%), which occurred mostly within the first year of treatment. These were mostly 
mild to moderate, transient (6-8 days), and occurred mostly as a single episode (70% vs 80%). Most 
reported were erythema/redness (2.1% vs 0.7%), swelling (1.5% vs 0.7%), pain (1.5% vs 0.8%), 
tenderness (1.3% vs 0.6%), and itching (1.3% vs 0.4%). Only 3 patients treated with alirocumab 
reported serious local injection site reactions, which all recovered. Only 0.3% vs <0.1% discontinued due 
to local injection site reactions. The slightly higher frequency of AEs reported for ADA positive patients 
(78.6% vs 76.2%) was mainly attributed to the higher frequency of local injection site reactions (7.5% vs 
3.6%), and may suggest that these events can be partly explained by an immunological response. Any 
other pattern could not be observed between ADA positive and ADA negative patients. In the current 
dossier, injection site reactions were also the only identified adverse drug reaction (ADR) (3.8% vs 
2.1%). This ADR was already known from the original dossier. The additional ADRs already identified in 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 80/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
the original dossier were hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity vasculitis, upper respiratory tract signs and 
symptoms, pruritus, urticaria, and eczema nummular. These could not be identified in the current study. 
No clear signs of any effect of alirocumab on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were 
observed. No difference was observed for musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25.4% vs 
25.3%). Some of these event were slightly more reported for alirocumab while others were slightly lower: 
myalgia (5.6% vs 5.3%), back pain (4.3% vs 4.2%), arthralgia (3.9% vs 3.7%), pain in extremity (3.1% 
vs 3.2%), muscle spasms (2.3% vs 2.1%), osteoarthritis (2.2% in both groups), musculoskeletal pain 
(1.9% vs 2.3%) and musculoskeletal chest pain (1.1% vs 1.4%). Further, no differences were observed 
in patients with increased CK levels according to treatment group (>3 ULN: 5.0% vs 5.1%; >10 ULN: 
0.5% vs 0.5%). 
Special attention has also been given to certain other adverse events. Further, the safety profile for those 
patients achieving very low LDL-C levels have been examined. The data for the <15 mg/dL subgroup is 
limited including 782 patients and thus any conclusions for this subgroup should be drawn with caution, 
while the data for the <25mg/dL subgroup including 4305 patients appears more substantial. In general, 
no relevant differences in AE frequencies were observed for these very low levels of LDL-C subgroups 
compared to higher LDL-C levels. 
Neurologic events were infrequently reported and more in the placebo group (4.0% vs 4.4%). These were 
only severe in 3.5% vs 3.3% of the cases. Hypoesthesia (1.0% vs 0.9%), paresthesia (0.9% vs 1.1%), 
and muscular weakness (0.5% vs 0.4%) were mostly reported. Further, no substantial difference was 
found for patients achieving very low levels of LDL-C vs higher achieved LDL-C levels (slightly lower in the 
< 25 mg/dL subgroup vs ≥ 25 mg/dL group; slightly higher in the < 15 mg/dL subgroup vs ≥ 15 mg/dL 
group) ranging from 1.4-2.5%. 
Specific attention has also been given to neurocognitive events, which were evaluated by an independent 
NCEP panel. This was specifically done since these events have previously been associated with very low 
LDL-C levels, although the initial dossier did not give any sign of such an association, but definite 
conclusions were difficult to draw due to the low frequencies. Currently, these events were found in a low 
frequency and no difference between treatment groups was found (1.5% vs 1.8%). Only 5.6% vs 4.8% 
of these events were evaluated as severe.  Confusional state was more reported for alirocumab (0.2% vs 
< 0.1%) but not considered treatment related. One (<0.1%) patient in the alirocumab group and 3 
(<0.1%) patients in the placebo group had a neurocognitive AE leading to death of which pre-existing 
medical history could explain the cause of death. Neurocognitive events were also very limited reported 
(0.4-1.0%) in the very low LDL-C groups (LDL-C < 25 mg/dL) and showed comparable frequencies to the 
LDL-C ≥ 25 mg/dL group, making any definite conclusions difficult. 
Diabetes was assessed by an independent diabetes panel. Treatment with alirocumab did not give any 
clear sign of increased diabetes risk. New onset diabetes in patients without diabetes at baseline, overall 
diabetes cases, and diabetes in patients with diabetes at baseline all reported similar incidences as to 
placebo; 9.6% vs 10.1%, 8.7% vs 9.8%, 18.8% vs 21.2%, respectively. No meaningful differences were 
observed for change from baseline in mean HbA1c with +0.09% and +0.14% change for patients 
normoglycemic at baseline for alirocumab vs placebo, strengthening this observation. Diabetes risk was 
also assessed in the very low LDL-C achieved subgroup. New onset diabetes was detected through several 
ways including AEs, laboratory parameters (HbA1c and fasting glucose), and initiation of antidiabetic 
medications. New onset diabetes was observed at slightly higher frequency (4.5% vs 3.6% in the < 25 
and ≥ 25 mg/dL subgroup; 5.6% vs 3.9% in the < 15 and ≥ 25 mg/dL subgroup) although the patient 
numbers in the <15 mg/dL subgroup were limited. A propensity matching comparison found a HR of 1.09 
(0.83 to 1.42). A further analysis (similar to the FOURIER study) according to achieved LDL-C subgroup 
(5 groups) did not show a substantial higher risk in the < 20 mg/dL (<0.52 mmol/L) subgroup vs the 
≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L) subgroup (11.2% vs 9.8%) and a lack of a clear trend across the 5

subgroups. Therefore, any higher incidence of new onset diabetes with very low LDL-C levels by 
alirocumab treatment remains inconclusive. 
Ophthalmological events were more frequently reported with alirocumab during the initial dossier though 
remained inconclusive due to the low numbers. In particular, cataract was considered a potential risk in 
very low LDL-C levels based on very limited data. In the current dossier, the frequency of cataract was 
low and similar between both treatment groups (1.3%vs 1.4%). In very low LDL-C levels few AEs of 
cataract  were reported (0.4% - 0.9%) which were, however, all consistently slightly higher for the lower 
LDL-C subgroups. Further data will likely be available from the ODYSSEY PASS observational study. Until 
then cataract should at least remain included as potential risk in the RMP. 
For allergic reactions, a similar frequency was found (7.9% vs 7.8%), with rash, pruritus, asthma, 
eczema and conjuctivitus being the most observed AEs with the majority being mild (61%) to moderate 
(33%) and most recovered (79% vs 74%). Hemolytic anaemia was reported to be very rare (3 vs 1 
patients), and none considered to be related to alirocumab treatment.  
There was no sign of any hepatic disorders with alirocumab as AEs were similarly reported (5.3% vs 
5.7%) with most frequently reported AEs being alanine aminotransferase increased (1.4% vs 1.8%), 
hepatic steatosis (0.8% vs 1.0%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (0.7% vs 0.7%), and potential 
drug-induced liver injury (0.6% vs 0.4%). Potential Hy’s law cases were similar (0.2%) and serious 
hepatic disorder AEs were reported in 0.6% of patients in both treatment groups. Differences in liver 
enzyme abnormalities were also not meaningful. Increases in ALT according to pre-specified criteria  
(elevations of ALT ≥3 x ULN (if baseline ALT <ULN) or ALT ≥2 times the baseline value (if baseline ALT 
≥ULN) for reporting an AE) were 221 (2.4%) vs 234 (2.5%); ALT values >3 ULN was 2.3% vs 2.4%; ALT 
values >10 ULN was 0.3% vs 0.2%; and combination of ALT>3 ULN with total bilirubin >2 ULN (potential 
Hy’s law case) was 16 (0.2%) vs 21 (0.2%) patients in the placebo group.  
Adverse events in the renal and urinary disorders SOC did not report any imbalance ( 668 (7.1%) vs 696 
(7.4%)). This was supported by an absence of differences for renal function abnormalities. Patients with 
more than 30% change in eGFR not being different (8.2% vs 9.2%). Also no differences were observed 
for renal function abnormalities with patients with more than 30% change in eGFR not being different 
(8.2% vs 9.2%). Also no differences were observed for eGFR levels (62.5% vs 63.8% eGFR 60-90, 20.3% 
vs 19.5% eGFR 30-60, 1.1% vs 1.3% eGFR 15-30 mL/min/1.73m2) or abnormal urate levels (16.1% vs 
15.8%). 
Serious adverse events were reported at comparable frequency (23.3% vs 24.9%) confirming previous 
findings in the initial MAA. The most frequently reported serious AEs were non-cardiac chest pain, angina 
pectoris, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, syncope, acute kidney injury, osteoaethritis, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, all at comparable frequencies. A lower frequency of deaths was reported 
with alirocumab (3.5% vs 4.2%), also including deaths which could not be determined by the CEC for 
efficacy. 
No meaningful differences were observed in vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate and weight. 
Specific data according to age categories of <65 years, 65-75 years, 75-85 years, and >85 shows a 
slightly higher incidence of AEs ≥ 75 years of age, however, numbers are small and do not allow for any 
conclusions. For renal impairment a slightly higher incidence of AEs was observed, however, this was 
independent of treatment assignment. Very limited patients with GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² were 
included (n=65). 
Any data on gonadal steroid hormones and gonadotropins were only very limited, but did not show 
relevant alterations.

2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
With the presentation of safety data of the current outcome trial, the controlled safety data for alirocumab 
have been extensively increased. Safety data were generally in line with those observed in the original 
dossier. The results provide some more reassurance on some of the safety issues typically known to be 
associated with lipid lowering drugs, including musculoskeletal adverse events, diabetes and hepatic 
safety. While other safety issues including some aspects on the safety in very low LDL-C levels remain 
inconclusive. Results show a possible higher frequency of cataract in very low LDL-C levels, therefore, this 
remains as potential risk in the RMP.

2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC has been updated as follows (New text in bold, 
removed text strikethrough): 
"Primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 89/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Praluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
The effect of Praluent on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to 
reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other 
risk factors:  
• 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other 
lipid-lowering therapies or, 
•  alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are 
statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
For study results with respect to effects on LDL-C, cardiovascular events and populations 
studied see section 5.1." 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The change is not related to a change in legal status or to a new presentation, and no particular critical 
safety issues have been identified with Praluent. Therefore, as per the “Guideline on the readability of 
the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use”, a new consultation with target 
patient groups for the package leaflet is not considered mandatory nor necessary. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 directed against human proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the LDLR on 
the liver cell surface, thus preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. LDLR is the primary receptor 
that clears circulating LDL, therefore the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood levels 
of LDL-C. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available 
to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. 
In the initial submission, alirocumab has demonstrated a substantial and consistent reduction in LDL-C 
and other lipid parameters alone and on top of existing lipid lowering therapy (LLT) options including 
statins and ezetimibe in several groups of patients with hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia. 
Alirocumab has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Based on these observations the following 
indication was approved at the time of the initial marketing authorisation of Praluent:  
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 90/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  
Praluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet:  
• in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LD 
-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or,  
• alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for 
whom a statin is contra-indicated.  
The effect of Praluent on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. 
In the current variation, the following indication was proposed by the MAH mainly based on the submitted 
results of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study (n=18924 patients), a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the effect of alirocumab on the occurrence of CV 
events in patients with established CV disease (CVD) and who have experienced an ACS event within 4 to 
52 weeks prior to randomization. 
Based on this study the applicant proposed the following (additional) indication: 
Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Established Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease 
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
unstable angina requiring hospitalization) and all-cause mortality by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct 
to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
•  alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
However, this proposed additional indication has been subject to further discussion and modification 
during the procedure, see below. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cardiovascular disease comprises a group of diseases that include both vessels in the heart and other 
arterial blood vessels, thereby including coronary heart disease (CHD), coronary artery disease (CAD), 
and ACS, among several other conditions. All these are characterized by atherosclerosis and can be 
asymptomatic, with the exception of ACS, which encompasses unstable angina (UA) and myocardial 
infarction (MI). Patients with recent ACS are a subset of the patients with CVD who are characterized by 
a high risk for suffering recurrent coronary events in the near term. Registry data indicate CV mortality as 
high as 13% at 5 years, with more than 4 out of 5 deaths occurring after initial discharge from hospital, 
supported by a rate of recurrent events being higher in the first months after hospitalisation. Despite a 
higher CV risk for patients shortly after ACS, beyond one year the risk wanes progressively to that of the 
general population of patients with established CVD. Moreover, the origin of CV events in all CVD 
conditions is driven by a similar physiopathology. With respect to the OUTCOMES study, patients were 
enrolled within a year of an ACS event. Thus, during the course of the study, these patients progressively 
evolved to a more chronic status. Moreover, the design of the OUTCOMES study can be viewed as a 
prognostic enrichment strategy as patients with recent ACS have a greater likelihood of having MACE 
compared with the “more chronic” patient population with established CVD.  
EMA/152718/2019

Epidemiological and pharmacological intervention trials have demonstrated a strong and direct linear 
relationship between LDL-C levels and CV events; for example, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialist (CTT) 
Collaboration meta-analysis that examined 26 large statin CV event trials encompassing approximately 
170 000 patients demonstrated that a 22% reduction in major CV events could be ascribed to every 
1 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C, even in patients with baseline LDL-C levels <2 mmol/L 
[77 mg/dL]). In practice, many high CV risk patients are not treated with optimized regimens of statins 
and, even if they are, cannot achieve optimal LDL-C levels of 30 mg/dL to 50 mg/dL (0.78 mmol/L to 
1.29 mmol/L) with most available oral lipid-lowering drugs, leaving a substantial residual risk for 
patients. An unmet need remains, and therefore, additional pharmacological therapies for the prevention 
of CVD may be necessary, particularly for high-risk patients with ACS. 
Recent data from the FOURIER CV outcome study conducted with evolocumab (Repatha) have provided 
additional support to the concept that lower LDL-C values obtained via PCSK9 inhibition are associated 
with reduction in risk of CV events beyond that achievable with standard oral lipid-lowering treatment 
alone. This benefit was demonstrated in a secondary prevention scenario in patients with established 
arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are 3 categories of lipid-lowering drugs that are registered for the prevention of CV risk including 
statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), ezetimibe (inhibitor of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and 
related plant sterols), and evolocumab (a PCSK9 inhibitor).  
Statins are among the most studied drugs in CVD prevention and considered as the gold-standard for CV 
risk prevention in clinical guidelines. Although clinical guidelines clearly support the use of statins as 
treatment initiation with a LDL-C target <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or a reduction of at least 50% if the 
baseline is between 1.8 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L (70 mg/dL and 135 mg/dL) in patients at very high-risk, 
a need exists for additional therapies for LDL-C lowering and CVD prevention, because some patients who 
are already receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a statin still have a residual CVD risk due to high 
baseline LDL-C or limitations in statin tolerability. It is well known that some patients suffer from statin 
side effects (eg, myalgia) that limit their ability to take a statin or a high enough dose of statin to reach 
their LDL-C goal. Statin-intolerant patients are at higher risk of not achieving target LDL-C levels 
appropriate to their level of CV risk given that non-statin therapies, other than PCSK9 inhibitors, typically 
provide only about a 15-20% reduction in LDL-C. 
Ezetimibe is also registered in several countries to reduce the risk of CV events in adult patients with CHD 
and a history of ACS when added to ongoing statin therapy or initiated concomitantly with a statin. In 
clinical guidelines ezetimibe is recommended to be used as second-line therapy in association with statins 
when the therapeutic goal is not achieved at the maximal tolerated statin dose or in patients intolerant to 
statins or with contraindications to these drugs, although the absolute benefit from adding ezetimibe may 
be limited.  
For the reduction of CV risk, evolocumab is indicated to reduce the cardiovascular risk in patients with 
“established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial 
disease) . . .”. This indication is based on the results of the CV outcomes trial conducted with evolocumab, 
the FOURIER study. This study was a double-blind, randomized (1:1 ratio), placebo-controlled, 
event-driven study involving 27564 patients with established cardiovascular disease and with LDL-C ≥70 
mg/dL and/or non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL despite high-or moderate-intensity statin therapy, with a median 
follow-up duration of 26 months. Established cardiovascular events was defined as a history of myocardial 
infarction, non-haemorrhagic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease, as well as additional CV 
risk factors, which appears somewhat wider than the patients included in the ODYSSEY OUTCOME study.  
Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk for the primary composite endpoint (time to first occurrence of 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 92/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
CV death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for UA, or coronary revascularization; HR 0.85; 95%CI: 0.79 to 
0.92; p<0.001), with an absolute risk reduction of approximately 2% within this time frame. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
3.1.3.1.  Favourable effects 
In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study (n=18924 patients) alirocumab demonstrated a significant 
reduction on the composite primary endpoint of time to CHD death, non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal 
ischemic stroke, or UA requiring hospitalisation, whichever occurred first (903 [9.5%] vs 1052 [11.1%]; 
HR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78, 0.93; p < 0.0001)) after a mean of 31 months of treatment with the beneficial 
effect starting at approximately 8 months of treatment and primarily driven by MI (83 less events). This 
translated in an absolute risk reduction of approximately 1.6% for the entire study period for the primary 
endpoint. Included were patients at very high CV risk identified by documented ACS event within 4 to 
52 weeks (median 3.6 months) prior to randomisation, and an elevated LDL-C level in need for LLT 
according to practice guidelines. About 34% had a previous documented CAD, 21% had another CVD 
(CHF, PAD or cerebrovascular disease) and/or additional CV risk factors (hypertension, family history of 
CAD, diabetes). The observed treatment effect was a result of an observed LDL-C reduction of 40-56% 
from a starting median level of 2.39 mmol/L in LDL-C in patients primarily treated with high intensity 
statin background therapy (89%). Alirocumab also reduced Apo B, non-HDL-C, fasting TGs, and Lp(a) 
and increased HDL-C – as also shown in earlier studies. 
The primary endpoint demonstrated a consistent beneficial effect across a wide range of subgroups, 
except for the Asian population. A consistent effect was seen for a subgroup with already low levels of 
LDL-C at baseline (<1.81 mmol/L). Further, a continuous relationship between the level of achieved 
LDL-C and adjusted CV event rates could be demonstrated.  
Hierarchical testing of secondary composite endpoints of any CHD event (major CHD event, UA 
requiring hospitalization, ischaemia-driven coronary revascularization procedure), any major CHD event 
(CHD death, non-fatal MI), any CV event (any non-fatal CHD event, any CV death, and non-fatal ischemic 
stroke), and CHMP guideline recommended composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and 
non-fatal ischemic stroke showed consistent beneficial effects until the statistical testing was violated at 
the level of the CHD deaths endpoint. 
3.1.3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A trend of reduction in CHD deaths and CV deaths was observed. Further a nominally statistically 
significant reduction in all-cause death was demonstrated, however, the hierarchical testing was 
already violated for analysing of this endpoint. No particular pattern could be observed for the type of 
non-CV deaths. 
The inclusion of unstable angina requiring hospitalisation in the primary endpoint is considered less 
robust in particular with respect to objective definitions and may introduce bias in relation to clinical 
decision making. However, UA contributed the least to the primary endpoint in comparison to the other 
components, and the effect was consistent with the primary analysis for those (combined) endpoints 
excluding UA. 
There was a limited representation of patients above 75 years (1007 patients, 5.3%).  
3.1.3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall exposure data from clinical studies has substantially increased from 3340 patients in the 
initial dossier to an additional 18924 subjects treated in the pivotal study (OUTCOME). Further, it has 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 93/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
been estimated that the alirocumab exposure has reached 59216 patient years in the postmarking setting 
at time of writing this report.  
Consistent with the initial submission, alirocumab generally displays a safety profile similar to that of 
the placebo group with 75.8% vs 77.1% for alirocumab and placebo reported adverse events. 
Comparable to the initial dossier, the most common adverse event was injection site reaction (3.8% vs 
2.1%) for alirocumab and placebo, respectively, and this was the only drug related adverse event 
identified. Serious adverse events between alirocumab and placebo were also similar (23.3% vs 
24.9%). Most frequently reported serious adverse events were found in the group of ischaemic coronary 
artery disorders (non-cardiac chest pain (2.3% vs 2.4%), angina pectoris (1.2% vs 1.4%)). The safety 
profile according to dose level was comparable. 
Slightly more patients treated with alirocumab discontinued (21.9% vs 15.8%) mainly due to blinded 
roll-over to placebo in case of very low LDL-C levels (7.7%). Alirocumab was generally well tolerated with 
low number of discontinuations due to adverse events (3.6% vs 3.4%). This included myalgia (0.2%, 
0.2%), and injection site reactions (0.2% vs <0.1%), respectively.  
The incidence of local injection site reactions was slightly higher in the alirocumab group (3.8% 
versus 2.1% in the control group) mostly during the first year of treatment. However, the adverse events 
were of mild to moderate intensity and transient and barely resulted in discontinuations (0.2% vs 
<0.1%). The differences in injection site reactions may partly be explained by immunological responses 
due to the presence of anti-alirocumab antibodies. Anti-alirocumab antibodies were infrequent but 
more frequent in the alirocumab group (5.5%) compared with the control group (1.6%). The slightly 
higher frequency of AEs reported for ADA positive patients (78.6% vs 76.2%) was mainly attributed to 
the higher frequency of local injection site reactions (7.5% vs 3.6%). Apart from the issues discussed 
with injection site reactions, no other clinically relevant adverse events differences were detected. The 
incidence in neutralizing antibodies was low with 43 patients (0.5%) in the alirocumab group versus 6 
patients (<0.1%)  in the control group.  
Alirocumab treatment was not associated with any apparent musculoskeletal related AEs, adverse 
events known to be associated with existing lipid modifying therapy. The incidences of these AEs was 
comparable (25.4% vs 25.3%) although some small differences in individual AEs appeared, e.g. myalgia 
(5.6% vs 5.3%), back pain (4.3% vs 4.2%), arthralgia (3.9% vs 3.7%), muscle spasms (2.3% vs 2.1%), 
musculoskeletal pain (1.9% vs 2.3%) and musculoskeletal chest pain (1.1% vs 1.4%). Yet, no 
differences were observed in patients with increased CK levels according to treatment group (>3 ULN: 
5.0% vs 5.1%; >10 ULN: 0.5% vs 0.5%). 
The frequency of neurocognitive adverse events as assessed by an independent panel was low and 
comparable between treatment groups (1.5% vs 1.8%). These AEs  were also very limited reported 
(0.4-1.0%) in the very low LDL-C groups (LDL-C < 25 mg/dL) and showed comparable frequencies to the 
LDL-C ≥ 25 mg/dL group, although the limited numbers make any definite conclusions difficult. 
A similar incidence of new onset of diabetes mellitus (NODM) was observed for alirocumab 9.6% vs 
10.1%, while change from baseline in HbA1c values were also comparable (+0.09% and +0.14%). Very 
low levels also did not provide a clear sign for an increased risk for diabetes. New onset diabetes was 
observed at slightly higher frequency (4.5% vs 3.6% in the < 25 and ≥ 25 mg/dL subgroup; 5.6% vs 
3.9% in the < 15 and ≥ 15 mg/dL subgroup). However, a propensity matching comparison found a HR of 
1.09 (0.83 to 1.42). Also, a further analysis (similar to the FOURIER study) according to achieved LDL-C 
subgroup (5 groups) did not show a substantial higher risk in the < 20 mg/dL (<0.52 mmol/L) subgroup 
vs the ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L) subgroup (11.2% vs 9.8%) and a lack of a clear trend across the 5 
subgroups.

No clear effect on hepatic disorders of alirocumab was observed (5.3% vs 5.7%). Differences in liver 
enzyme abnormalities were also not meaningful. Increases in ALT according to pre-specified criteria were 
221 (2.4%) vs 234 (2.5%); ALT values >3 ULN was 2.3% vs 2.4%; ALT values >10 ULN was 0.3% vs 
0.2%; and combination of ALT>3 ULN with total bilirubin >2 ULN (potential Hy’s law case) was 16 (0.2%) 
vs 21 (0.2%).  
No clear effect on renal disorders was observed (7.1% vs 7.4%). Also, there were no differences in 
renal function abnormalities or other renal markers. 
For other adverse events of special interest including allergic reactions (7.9% vs 7.8%), haemolytic 
anaemia (3 vs 1) and neurologic events (4.0% vs 4.4%) no meaningful differences were observed.  
No meaningful differences were observed in vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate and weight. 
3.1.3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Exposure in the pivotal study was limited to a median of 31 months; this may be too short to exclude 
long term effects. An open-label extension study is being performed to further address long term safety 
longer than 5 years of treatment, the clinical impact of very low LDL-C levels for extended period of time, 
neurocognitive disorders, and gonadal steroid hormones and gonadotropins, to be finalised in 2024. 
In the current dossier, the frequency of cataract was low and similar between both treatment groups 
(1.3%vs 1.4%). In very low LDL-C levels few AEs of cataract  were reported (0.4% - 0.9%) which were, 
however, all consistently slightly higher for the lower LDL-C subgroups. Therefore, cataract is maintained 
as a potential risk in the RMP. 
Relative limited safety data is available for patients > 75 years of age (n=1007; 5.3%), although this 
can be considered sufficient in absolute terms. A slightly higher incidence of AEs was observed for ≥ 75 
years of age, however, numbers are small and do not allow for any conclusions.  
A slightly higher incidence of AEs were observed in patients with renal impairment, but this was not 
related to treatment assignment. Very limited numbers of patients with severe renal impairment were 
included (n=65). Additional safety data on patients with liver insufficiency are lacking as these were 
not specifically screened for at inclusion.  
Any data on gonadal steroid hormones and gonadotropins were very limited, but did not show any 
relevant alterations.

3.2.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.2.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the initial MAA, alirocumab was approved mainly based on a demonstration of a substantial and 
consistent reduction in LDL-C and other lipid parameters alone and on top of existing lipid lowering 
therapy (LLT) options including statins and ezetimibe in several groups of patients with 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia.  
In the current dossier, alirocumab has demonstrated a beneficial effect of reducing cardiovascular events 
primarily on MI in a selected patient group with very high cardiovascular risk primarily as identified by a 
recent ACS (acute coronary syndrome 4 to 52 weeks before randomisation). The effect observed for 
ischaemic events of MI can be considered clinically relevant, especially since this is supported by a trend 
towards a beneficial effect on cardiovascular death and overall mortality. In particular, a continuous 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 96/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relation between the achieved LDL-C levels and adjusted CV event rates was observed, with no apparent 
lower limit of LDL-C at which the potential benefit disappears.  
Regarding safety, alirocumab displayed an acceptable safety profile with a comparable incidence of 
adverse events to that of the placebo group (statin and other lipid lowering therapy), with limited patients 
discontinuing treatment or showing serious adverse events. In addition, alirocumab treatment did not 
cause any major effects on known safety problems associated with existing lipid lowering therapies such 
as liver disorders, renal disorders, diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders, or generally any effects in 
those reaching very low LDL-C levels.  
For a lifelong treatment, a follow-up period of 31 months can be considered limited. Longer term data is 
being generated (see risk management plan section) intended to be finalised by 2024, although these 
data are open-label and not controlled. 
3.2.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The applicant has conducted an outcome study to address and confirm the cardiovascular safety and 
efficacy of alirocumab in a patient population largely identified on their CV risk profile (very high CV risk 
primarily based on recent ACS). In agreement with clinical practice guidelines (e.g. 2016 ESC/EAS 
Guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice) the included patients had elevated 
LDL-C despite treatment with statins and other lipid lowering therapy, but were still in need for further 
treatment due to their very high cardiovascular risk primarily defined by their recent cardiovascular 
event, amongst some other additional CV risk characteristics. Despite the need for further lowering LDL-C 
levels according to their very high cardiovascular risk profile, the effect could be considered moderate 
with a 15% reduction of the primary endpoint and an approximate 1.6% absolute risk reduction achieved 
over 31 months of treatment. Yet, the effect was consistent, primarily achieved by reduction in ischaemic 
events of MI, and supported by a trend towards a beneficial effect in CV death and overall mortality. 
Importantly, the effect was consistent among subgroups with generally a more beneficial effect with 
higher baseline risk.  
The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study supports treating of LDL-C to ‘’as low as possible’’ levels, which has been 
subject to discussion in recent years (e.g. in 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood 
Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults). An additional analysis demonstrated 
that there is no indication of a J-shaped curve, while there seems to be no lower limit of LDL-C at which 
potential CV benefit disappears. Further, a consistent treatment effect is also observed across the entire 
range of initial baseline LDL-C level. For instance, a consistent effect including a (trend towards a) 
beneficial effect was observed in the lowest subgroup of patients with LDL-C levels of < 70 mg/dL at 
baseline. Moreover, patients who had an LDL-C <70 mg/dL [1.81 mmol/L] at baseline (20% [n = 3751]) 
also demonstrated a beneficial effect being only slightly less than for the overall population. This further 
supports the statement as included in the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in 
the treatment of lipid disorders (EMA/CHMP/748108/2013, Rev. 3) of “The relationship between LDL-C 
levels and CHD risk is present over a broad range of LDL levels. The dividing line between 
"normocholesterolaemia" and "hypercholesterolaemia" is arbitrary and in fact may be non-existent. 
Epidemiological data indicate a continuous increasing risk from very low to “normal” and high levels of 
LDL-C.” 
Although the data did not indicate a higher incidence of adverse events with very low LDL-C levels 
compared to higher achieved levels of LDL-C, the 31 month treatment period could still be considered 
relatively short to reveal certain consequences of lifelong very low LDL-C levels or other alirocumab 
effects. It remains important to follow this up closely for a longer period of time as addressed in the 
open-label follow-up study described in the RMP. In the past, with statins, concerns were raised of 
assumed increased risk when cholesterol would be lowered too much, including an increased risk for 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 97/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
cancer, haemorrhagic stroke, non-cardiovascular death, neurocognitive abnormalities and alterations in 
steroid production. The current dossier has specifically addressed several of these safety aspects, but 
these concerns remain unconfirmed, which can be considered reassuring. However, an inconclusive 
signal remains present for cataract, which  therefore remains included in the RMP. For other safety 
aspects, including adverse events specifically known to be associated with existing lipid lowering therapy, 
including muscle related events, hepatic events, renal events, and diabetes, these have been further 
monitored within the current study as well, and did not give rise to specific concerns. Further, adverse 
events of hypersensitivity and immunological events have been followed-up without any clear safety 
signs with alirocumab treatment. Overall, any new safety issues not already included within current SmPC 
could not be identified. 
3.2.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In addition to the current indication for alirocumab of primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed 
dyslipidaemia, the applicant initially proposed the following indication to be added:  
Prevention of cardiovascular events in established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
unstable angina requiring hospitalization) and all-cause mortality by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct 
to correction of other risk factors: 
- in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
- alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for 
whom a statin is contraindicated. 
For study results with respect to effects on LDL-C, cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
The proposed added indication comprises a patient population largely identified based on their (very high) 
CV risk profile. In agreement with clinical practice guidelines (e.g. 2016 ESC/EAS Guideline on 
cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice) the included patients had elevated LDL-C despite 
treatment with statins and other lipid lowering therapy, but were still in need for further treatment due to 
their very high cardiovascular risk (see further discussion in section 3.2.2.).  
However, some issues in relation to the proposed indication were identified and were further considered 
during the procedure. These related to the following: 
• 
Including a separate underlined statement of “prevention of cardiovascular disease’’ was not 
accepted, as it might have implied that alirocumab could also be indicated for primary prevention 
which is not the case. Further, the term primary prevention at large (“detecting a disease in its 
earliest stages, before symptoms appear, and intervening to slow or stop its progression”), is not 
applicable to the selected patient population of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study.  
•  Mortality was proposed to be mentioned in the indication: to reduce the risk of … all-cause 
mortality. However, although a significant effect on mortality was noticed, the overall significance 
of the result on mortality was obtained when the hierarchical testing was already violated. 
Moreover, separate endpoints should generally not be included within the indication (guideline on 
Summary of Product Characteristics 2009). Therefore, explicit inclusion of a mortality benefit in 
the indication was not acceptable. A reduction of all-cause mortality was observed with only 
nominal, statistical significance only when taking into account the predefined, failed hierarchical 
EMA/152718/2019  
Page 98/101 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
testing procedure, (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.98). The findings are presented in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC.   
• 
• 
The statement of to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart 
disease death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization) was not 
considered entirely appropriate as the indication should be consistent with SmPC guideline 
recommendations (A guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics 2009) indicating that 
study endpoints should generally not be included in the indication. 
Finally, it was questioned whether the cardiovascular benefit as demonstrated in the selected 
very high cardiovascular risk patient population from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, which is  
a-priori characterized by the presence of a recent ACS, could be extrapolated to the 
cardiovascular risk population at large.  This was considered applicable by CHMP based on the 
reasoning provided below.  
The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study included patients with a recent ACS event in the last 1-12 months. This 
is representative for a population with established cardiovascular disease and could be considered as 
having very high CV risk, in line with learned society clinical practice guidelines e.g. ESC CV risk 
prevention guideline. In accordance with these practice guidelines, classifying patients with a comparable 
very high cardiovascular risk based on established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is generally not 
limited to one vascular area and thus includes also patients with other compromised vascular domains 
like stable CAD, stroke and PAD. It was considered being evident that similar CV risk reduction 
management is applicable for these patients. Moreover, the OUTCOMES study data confirm that, based 
on the same underlying disease, the effect observed with alirocumab in reducing the risk of CV events 
over the course of several years post-ACS can be translated to a broader population with established 
ASCVD following a continuous spectrum. More specifically, patients were administered alirocumab during 
their acute CV event, but only after stabilization. Although patients were enrolled within a year of an ACS 
event, patients entered the chronic phase of ASCVD during the course of the study, as they were followed 
for three years after an ACS event. The analyses of CV events in the OUTCOMES study according to the 
time period showed that the benefit with alirocumab was consistent over time, also in a stage that 
patients were clearly considered to have stable ASCVD, beyond 1 year. Furthermore, two pre-specified 
analyses in the pool of phase 3 studies and in the phase 3 LONG TERM study, both of which mostly 
included patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but not acute ACS, showed a 
positive effect on CV risk.  
Of note, patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and statin-intolerance or for 
whom a statin is contra-indicated could also be treated based on this indication. Although, such data have 
not been provided or evaluated, this would be acceptable based on extrapolation from LDL-C lowering 
data from the initial submission. 
Based on these considerations, the applicant amended the indication during the procedure to the 
following finally accepted proposal: 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  to reduce 
cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors: 
- 
- 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated.

EFC11570 was provided in support of the application; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to evaluate the effect of alirocumab on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in 
patients who have recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome. As a consequence, sections, 4.1, 
4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is being updated accordingly. In addition, 
an updated RMP version 4.2 was agreed during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Additional market protection 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Marketing

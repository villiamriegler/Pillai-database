CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
HIV-1 infection 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. 
In adults, the demonstration of the benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infection is based on results 
of one study in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) 
and studies in which tenofovir disoproxil was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in 
antiretroviral pre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the 
majority of patients having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents, with 
NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years. 
The choice of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 
infection should be based on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. 
Hepatitis B infection 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with: 
- 
- 
- 
compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or 
fibrosis (see section 5.1). 
evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).

Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adolescents 12 to 
< 18 years of age with: 
- 
compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication and 
persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of moderate to severe 
inflammation and/or fibrosis. With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric 
patients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or 
treatment of chronic hepatitis B. 
Posology 
HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B 
Adults and adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg 
The recommended dose of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for the treatment of HIV or for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis B is 245 mg (one tablet) once daily taken orally with food. 
The decision to treat paediatric patients (adolescents) should be based on careful consideration of 
individual patient needs and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the value 
of baseline histological information. The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with continued 
therapy must be weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence of resistant 
hepatitis B virus and the uncertainties as regards the long term impact of bone and renal toxicity (see 
section 4.4). 
Serum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric patients 
with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least 12 months in 
patients with HBeAg negative disease. 
Duration of therapy in adult and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis B 
The optimal duration of treatment is unknown. Treatment discontinuation may be considered as follows: 
- 
- 
In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least 12 
months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection on 
two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) is confirmed or until HBs 
seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4). Serum ALT and HBV DNA levels 
should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological relapse. 
In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until HBs 
seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. Treatment discontinuation may also be 
considered after stable virological suppression is achieved (i.e. for at least 3 years) provided 
serum ALT and HBV DNA levels are followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect 
any late virological relapse. With prolonged treatment for more than 2 years, regular reassessment 
is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy remains appropriate for the 
patient. 
In adult patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment cessation is not recommended.

Paediatric population 
Reduced doses of tenofovir (the active ingredient of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva) are also used for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is available only as 245 mg film-coated tablets, it is not suitable for the use 
in paediatric patients aged 2 < 12 years. Other suitable formulations should be checked for their 
availability. 
The safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children or children with chronic 
hepatitis B under 2 years of age have not been established. No data are available. 
Missed dose 
If a patient misses a dose of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, 
the patient should take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with food as soon as possible and resume their 
normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva by more than 
12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply 
resume the usual dosing schedule. 
If the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva another tablet should be taken. 
If the patient vomits more than 1 hour after taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva they do not need to take 
another dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years 
(see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Tenofovir is eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to tenofovir increases in patients with renal 
dysfunction. 
Adults 
There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with moderate 
and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and long-term safety data has not been 
evaluated for mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min). Therefore, in adult patients 
with renal impairment tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits of treatment are 
considered to outweigh the potential risks. 
Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) 
Limited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil in patients 
with mild renal impairment. 
Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) 
If administration of a lower dose is not possible, prolonged dose intervals using the 245 mg film-coated 
tablets may be used. 
Administration of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil every 48 hours can be used based on modelling of 
single-dose pharmacokinetic data in HIV-negative and non-HBV infected subjects with varying degrees 
of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis, but has not been 
confirmed in clinical studies. Therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be 
closely monitored in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and haemodialysis patients 
Adequate dose adjustments cannot be applied with this product due to lack of alternative tablet 
strengths, therefore use in this group of patients is not recommended. If no alternative treatment is 
available, prolonged dose intervals using the 245 mg film-coated tablets may be used as follows: 
Severe renal impairment: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil may be administered every 72 - 96 hours (dosing 
twice a week). 
Haemodialysis patients: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil may be administered every 7 days following 
completion of a haemodialysis session*. 
These dose interval adjustments have not been confirmed in clinical studies. Simulations suggest that 
the prolonged dose interval using Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 245 mg film-coated tablets is not 
optimal and could result in increased toxicity and possibly inadequate response. Therefore clinical 
response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
*Generally, once weekly dosing assuming three haemodialysis sessions per week, each of 
approximately 4 hours duration or after 12 hours cumulative haemodialysis. 
No dosing recommendations can be given for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance 
< 10 ml/min. 
Paediatric population 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see 
section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
If Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is discontinued in patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without HIV 
co-infection, these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva tablets should be taken once daily, orally with food. 
In exceptional circumstances in patients having particular difficulty in swallowing, Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva can be administered following disintegration of the tablet in at least 100 ml of water, orange 
juice or grape juice. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir 
disoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatitis B 
Patients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of 
transmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood. Appropriate 
precautions must continue to be used. 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
- 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal 
products containing tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
- 
- 
Triple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides 
There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early 
stage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as 
with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. 
Renal and bone effects in adult population 
Renal effects 
Tenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney. Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, 
hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with 
the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). 
Renal monitoring 
It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with 
tenofovir disoproxil and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored 
after two to four weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months 
thereafter in patients without renal risk factors. In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more frequent 
monitoring of renal function is required. 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in 
any adult patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, 
including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see 
section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration should also be given to interrupting treatment with 
tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with creatinine clearance decreased to < 50 ml/min or decreases in 
serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl (0.32 mmol/l). Interrupting treatment with tenofovir disoproxil should 
also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been 
identified. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
Use of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal 
product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, 
cidofovir or interleukin-2). If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic agents is 
unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors for 
renal dysfunction. If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be 
monitored adequately. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of renal 
function is required in these patients (see section 4.5). In patients with renal risk factors, the co-
administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully evaluated. 
Tenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which 
are secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion 
transporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product). These 
renal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of 
tenofovir and cidofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products which are 
secreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be 
modified if they are co-administered. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal 
products which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is 
unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). 
Renal impairment 
Renal safety with tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients 
with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). 
Adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients 
There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with impaired renal 
function. Therefore, tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits of treatment are 
considered to outweigh the potential risks. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min) and in patients who require haemodialysis use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended. 
If no alternative treatment is available, the dosing interval must be adjusted and renal function should be 
closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Bone effects 
Bone abnormalities such as osteomalacia which can manifest as persistent or worsening bone pain and, 
which can infrequently contribute to fractures may be associated with tenofovir disoproxil-induced 
proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8). 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD). In HIV infected 
patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study (GS-99-903) that compared tenofovir disoproxil with 
stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, small 
decreases in BMD of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in BMD of 
spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly greater in this 
group until 96 weeks. However, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically 
relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks in this study. 
In other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen in 
patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor. 
Overall, in view of the bone abnormalities associated with tenofovir disoproxil and the limitations of 
long-term data on the impact of tenofovir disoproxil on bone health and fracture risk, alternative 
treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are at a high risk for 
fractures. 
If bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. 
Renal and bone effects in paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long-term effects of bone and renal toxicity. Moreover, the 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is 
recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide 
the appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider 
the need for supplementation. 
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV-1 
infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see sections 4.8 and 
5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to treatment, and 
monitored during treatment as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving 
tenofovir disoproxil renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of 
blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal 
tubulopathy). If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist 
should be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment. 
Interrupting treatment with tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline 
of renal function when no other cause has been identified. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). 
Renal impairment 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see 
section 4.2). Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment 
and should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir 
disoproxil therapy. 
Bone effects 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir 
disoproxil-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are uncertain 
(see section 5.1). 
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an 
endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. 
Liver disease 
Safety and efficacy data are very limited in liver transplant patients. 
There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HBV infected patients with 
decompensated liver disease and who have a Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score > 9. These patients may 
be at higher risk of experiencing serious hepatic or renal adverse reactions. Therefore, hepatobiliary and 
renal parameters should be closely monitored in this patient population. 
Exacerbations of hepatitis 
Flares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are 
characterised by transient increases in serum ALT. After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase in some patients (see section 4.8). In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases in 
serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or hepatic 
decompensation. Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation following 
hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. 
Flares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in patients 
who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy. Post-treatment exacerbations are usually associated with 
rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited. However, severe exacerbations, including 
fatalities, have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at repeated intervals with both 
clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. If 
appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In patients with advanced liver disease 
or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of 
hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
Liver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. 
Co-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients co-infected 
with hepatitis C or D virus. 
Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir 
disoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in 
HIV/HBV co-infected patients. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active 
hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral 
therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of 
worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance during therapy with 
tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. 
Use with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, 
especially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat). 
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The 
potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in 
conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, 
particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil 
and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir 
disoproxil. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. 
Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases 
evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any 
particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV 
treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these 
have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders 
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late-onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be 
considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical 
findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current 
national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
Immune reactivation syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious 
clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within 
the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, 
generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any 
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness 
or difficulty in movement. 
Elderly 
Tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. Elderly patients are more likely 
to have decreased renal function; therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients 
with tenofovir disoproxil. 
Excipients 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the 
potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products 
containing tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. 
Didanosine 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 
1). 
Renally eliminated medicinal products 
Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with 
medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport 
proteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir 
and/or the co-administered medicinal products. 
Use of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal 
product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, 
ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). 
Given that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is 
co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. 
Other interactions 
Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below 
(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once daily 
as “q.d.”). 
Table 1: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products 
Recommendation 
concerning 
co-administration with 
245 mg tenofovir 
disoproxil  
No dose adjustment is 
recommended. The 
increased exposure of 
tenofovir could potentiate 
tenofovir associated adverse 
events, including renal 
disorders. Renal function 
should be closely monitored 
(see section 4.4).

Recommendation 
concerning 
co-administration with 
245 mg tenofovir 
disoproxil  
Co-administration of 
tenofovir disoproxil and 
didanosine is not 
recommended (see section 
4.4). 
Increased systemic 
exposure to didanosine may 
increase didanosine related 
adverse reactions. Rarely, 
pancreatitis and lactic 
acidosis, sometimes fatal, 
have been reported. Co-
administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine at 
a dose of 400 mg daily has 
been associated with a 
significant decrease in CD4 
cell count, possibly due to 
an intracellular interaction 
increasing phosphorylated 
(i.e. active) didanosine. A 
decreased dosage of 250 mg 
didanosine co-administered 
with tenofovir disoproxil 
therapy has been associated 
with reports of high rates of 
virological failure within 
several tested combinations 
for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. 
Tenofovir disoproxil should 
not be administered 
concurrently with adefovir 
dipivoxil (see section 4.4). 
No clinically significant 
pharmacokinetic 
interactions when tenofovir 
disoproxil was 
co-administered with 
entecavir.

Recommendation

disoproxil  
Increased plasma 
concentrations of tenofovir 
resulting from co-
administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil, 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and 
atazanavir/ritonavir may 
increase adverse reactions 
related to tenofovir

tenofovir disoproxil when 
used with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer 
(e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) 
has not been established. 
The combination should be 
used with caution with 
frequent renal monitoring, 
if other alternatives are not 
available (see section 4.4).

2 The predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir. 
3 Study conducted with additional voxilaprevir 100 mg to achieve voxilaprevir exposures expected in HCV-infected patients. 
Studies conducted with other medicinal products 
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil was co-
administered with emtricitabine, lamivudine, indinavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, saquinavir (ritonavir 
boosted), methadone, ribavirin, rifampicin, tacrolimus, or the hormonal contraceptive 
norgestimate/ethinyl oestradiol. 
Tenofovir disoproxil must be taken with food, as food enhances the bioavailability of tenofovir (see 
section 5.2).

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with tenofovir disoproxil. Animal studies do not 
indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be considered 
during pregnancy, if necessary. 
In the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to 
reduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given to mothers, in 
addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were 
administered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 
months postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery. No 
safety signal has emerged from these data. 
Breast-feeding 
Generally, if the newborn is adequately managed for hepatitis B prevention at birth, a mother with 
hepatitis B may breast-feed her infant. 
Tenofovir is excreted in human milk at very low levels and exposure of infants through breast milk is 
considered negligible. Although long-term data is limited, no adverse reactions have been reported in 
breast-fed infants, and HBV-infected mothers using tenofovir disoproxil may breast-feed. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants. 
Fertility 
There are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. Animal 
studies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir disoproxil. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, renal 
failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) sometimes 
leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported. Monitoring of 
renal function is recommended for patients receiving Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (see section 4.4). 
HIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions following 
treatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents. These reactions are 
usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events. Approximately 1% of tenofovir disoproxil -treated 
adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. 
Hepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions 
following treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild. In clinical trials of HBV infected 
patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was nausea (5.4%). 
Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who 
have discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Assessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety data from clinical studies 
and post-marketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. 
HIV-1 clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on 
experience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced patients receiving treatment with tenofovir 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disoproxil (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for 
24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 treatment-naïve patients 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or stavudine (n = 301) in combination 
with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. 
Hepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is primarily 
based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult patients with 
chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg 
daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks. The adverse reactions 
observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety profile of tenofovir 
disoproxil. After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using Cockcroft-Gault equation) or -
3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] equation) after the first 4 
weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of renal function reported in tenofovir 
disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using Cockcroft-Gault equation) and -
0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation). 
Patients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with 
decompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study (GS-US-174-0108) 
in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or emtricitabine plus 
tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. 
In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse 
event; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed 
serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant differences 
between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm. After 168 weeks, 16% (7/45) of 
the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and 14% 
(3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure. Thirteen percent (6/45) of the tenofovir 
disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and 9% (2/22) of the 
entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate 
of < 2 mg/dl. 
At week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of 
13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil 
group and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in 
the tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% 
(2/22) in the entecavir group. 
Subjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events (see 
section 4.4). 
Patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir disoproxil 
were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 lamivudine-
resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. 
The adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by 
body system organ class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).

1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is not considered to be causally associated 
with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. 
2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical 
trials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical 
calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and 
the expanded access program (n = 7,319).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B: 
Renal impairment 
As Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety profile). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved 
or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. However, in some patients, declines in creatinine 
clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. Patients at risk of 
renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients 
receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete 
recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). 
Lactic acidosis  
Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with other 
antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver disease, or 
patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased risk of 
experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal outcomes. 
HIV-1: 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 
4.4). 
Immune reactivation syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune 
disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the 
reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of 
treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see 
section 4.4). 
Hepatitis B: 
Exacerbations of hepatitis during treatment 
In studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit of 
normal) and > 2-times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients. ALT 
elevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a majority 
of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided 
with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment (see 
section 4.4). 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment 
In HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred 
after discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and GS-
US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received treatment 
with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with other 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1). The adverse reactions observed in paediatric 
patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in 
clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see sections 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse 
reactions and 5.1). 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the BMD 
Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in 
subjects who received placebo. In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who 
switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on their 
stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events. 
Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of 
whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy. Seven patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) values between 70 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m2. Among them, 3 patients experienced a clinically 
meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil. 
Chronic hepatitis B 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomised study (study GS-US-174-0115) in 106 
adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks and a randomised study (Study GS-US-
174-0144) in 89 patients with chronic hepatitis B (2 to < 12 years of age) receiving treatment with 
tenofovir disoproxil (n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) for 48 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in 
paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those 
observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see sections 4.8 Tabulated summary of 
adverse reactions and 5.1). 
Reductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age. The 
BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed 
in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Other special population(s) 
Elderly 
Tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. Elderly patients are more likely 
to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients 
with tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended 
in adult patients with renal impairment treated with Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (see sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 5.2). The use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V.

4.9 
Overdose 
Symptoms 
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.3), and 
standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. 
Management 
Tenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is 
134 ml/min. It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Tenofovir disoproxil phosphate is the phosphate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir 
disoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside 
monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue. Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir 
diphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes. Tenofovir 
diphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the 
HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate and, after 
incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of 
cellular polymerases α, β, and γ. At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also shown no 
effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro assays. 
Data pertaining to HIV 
HIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of the 
wild-type laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB is 1 - 6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against 
primary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs. Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D, 
E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells. Tenofovir shows activity in 
vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. 
Resistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in reverse 
transcriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and safety). 
Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral experienced patients with strains harbouring the 
K65R mutation (see section 4.4). In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has 
been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. 
Clinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors. The results indicate 
that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that 
included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced response to 
tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults 
have been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, respectively. 
In study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean 
baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of < 5,000 
copies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years. Baseline genotypic analysis of 
HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance mutations associated 
with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated with protease inhibitors 
and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 
At week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels 
(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil 
245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001). A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil 
245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 
count (+13 cells/mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 for placebo, 
p-value = 0.0008). The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through 48 weeks 
(DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 or 
50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively). Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated patients 
developed the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. 
The 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and 
efavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy. The mean baseline CD4 cell 
count was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% of 
patients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS. Patients were stratified by baseline HIV-
1 RNA and CD4 count. Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads > 100,000 copies/ml and 
39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. 
By intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as 
failure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks 
of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, compared to 84% 
and 80% in the stavudine arm. At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 
400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 
compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. 
The average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was similar 
in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively). At 144 weeks of treatment, the average change 
from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and -3.03 log10 copies/ml; +263 and 
+283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively). A consistent 
response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen regardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and 
CD4 count. 
The K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group 
than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%). Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either preceded or 
was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases. Eight patients had HIV that expressed K65R 
in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks of treatment and 
the last one at week 96. No further K65R development was observed up to week 144. One patient in the 
tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus. From both the genotypic and 
phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of resistance to tenofovir. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data pertaining to HBV 
HBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed in 
the HepG2 2.2.15 cell line. The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, with 
CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. 
Resistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified (see 
Clinical efficacy and safety). In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, rtL180M, and 
rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine showed a susceptibility 
to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus. HBV strains expressing the rtL180M, 
rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated with resistance to entecavir showed a 
susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-type virus. HBV strains expressing 
the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and rtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir 
ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus. Viruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained 
susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold that of wild-type virus. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is 
based on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and HBeAg 
negative chronic hepatitis B. Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, lamivudine-
experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil 
resistance mutations at baseline. Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological responses in 
compensated patients. 
Experience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-
US-174-0103) 
Results through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir 
disoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in Table 3 
below. Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) HBeAg positive patients 
while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) patients negative for 
HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. 
In both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and 
Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell 
fibrosis). Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater 
proportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg 
treatment. Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as 
Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell 
fibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 3 below). 
In study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group 
than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week 48 (see 
Table 3 below).

Tenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with undetectable 
HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas Taqman HBV 
assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and study 
GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. 
Response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) and 
nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT 
(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined. Forty-nine 
of the 51 nucleoside-experienced patients were previously treated with lamivudine. Seventy-three 
percent of nucleoside-experienced and 69% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved complete response to 
treatment; 90% of nucleoside-experienced and 88% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved HBV DNA

abnormal ALT at baseline achieved HBV DNA suppression < 400 copies/ml.

Experience beyond 48 weeks in studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 
In studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103, after receiving double-blind treatment for 48 weeks 
(either tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg), patients rolled over with no 
interruption in treatment to open-label tenofovir disoproxil. In studies GS-US-174-0102 and 
GS-US-174-0103, 77% and 61% of patients continued in the study through to 384 weeks, respectively. 
At weeks 96, 144, 192, 240, 288 and 384, viral suppression, biochemical and serological responses were 
maintained with continued tenofovir disoproxil treatment (see Tables 4 and 5 below).

studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 at week 240 (see Table 6 below). Ninety-five percent 
(225/237) of patients without cirrhosis at baseline and 99% (93/94) of patients with cirrhosis at 
baseline had either no change or an improvement in fibrosis (Ishak fibrosis score). Of the 94 patients 
with cirrhosis at baseline (Ishak fibrosis score 5-6), 26% (24) experienced no change in Ishak fibrosis 
score and 72% (68) experienced regression of cirrhosis by week 240 with a reduction in Ishak fibrosis 
score of at least 2 points.

Experience in patients with HIV co-infection and prior lamivudine experience 
In a randomised, 48-week double-blind, controlled study of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg in adult 
patients co-infected with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B with prior lamivudine experience (study ACTG 
5127), the mean serum HBV DNA levels at baseline in patients randomised to the tenofovir arm were 
9.45 log10 copies/ml (n = 27). Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was associated with a mean 
change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week data, of -5.74 
log10 copies/ml (n = 18). In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. 
Experience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) 
The efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg plus 200 mg 
emtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in 
HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia (HBV DNA 
≥ 1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks. At baseline, 57% 
of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to emtricitabine plus 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with lamivudine. Overall at week 24, 
treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml 
(< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil 
(p = 0.672). In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil had undetectable HBV 
DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV 
assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504). 
Comparisons between treatment groups beyond week 24 are difficult to interpret since investigators had 
the option to intensify treatment to open-label emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil. Long-term studies 
to evaluate the benefit/risk of bitherapy with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV 
monoinfected patients are ongoing. 
Experience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) 
Study GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and entecavir 
(n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease. In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 
patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and mean serum ALT of 
61 U/l at baseline. Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months of prior lamivudine 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and 9 of 45 patients (20%) 
had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline. The co-primary safety 
endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed increase in serum creatinine 
≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. 
In patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of emtricitabine 
plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after 48 weeks of 
treatment. 
Overall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the 
comparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 7 below).

Experience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 
Using a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil, 
76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% (11/21) of subjects 
receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. 
Experience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) 
The efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind 
study (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with compensated 
liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of lamivudine resistance 
(rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M). Only five had adefovir-associated resistance mutations at baseline. One 
hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine 
plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively. Baseline demographics were similar between the 
two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were HBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, 
mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and mean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. 
After 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had HBV 
DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation. After 240 weeks of 
treatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had HBV DNA 
< 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation. Among the HBeAg positive 
subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 8 of 
65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240. In the HBeAg positive 
subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 13 of 68 subjects (19%) experienced 
HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240. Two 
subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss by Week 240, but not 
seroconversion to anti-HBs. Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil 
experienced HBsAg loss, with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion to anti-HBs. 
Clinical resistance 
Four hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 250) and HBeAg positive 
(GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients initially randomised to double-blind tenofovir disoproxil treatment 
and then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic changes in 
HBV polymerase from baseline. Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with HBV DNA > 400 
copies/ml at week 48 (n = 39), 96 (n = 24), 144 (n = 6), 192 (n = 5), 240 (n = 4), 288 (n = 6) and 384 
(n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil resistance have developed. 
Two hundred and fifteen HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 125) and HBeAg positive (GS-US-
174-0103, n = 90) patients initially randomised to double-blind adefovir dipivoxil treatment and then 
switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic changes in HBV 
polymerase from baseline. Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with HBV DNA > 400 
copies/ml at week 48 (n = 16), 96 (n = 5), 144 (n = 1), 192 (n = 2), 240 (n = 1), 288 (n = 1) and 384 
(n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil resistance have developed. 
In study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil 
resistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil for up to 168 weeks. 
Genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients with 
HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to 
tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 subjects in 
the tenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48. No amino acid substitutions associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil resistance were detected in any subject.

In study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received 
tenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks. Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who experienced a 
viremic episode (HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml) at their last time point on tenofovir disoproxil. Among 
them, sequence data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 2 of 4 
patients. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified 
in these isolates. 
In a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine resistance 
mutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks and then 51/52 
patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir-disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group). 
Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA 
> 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6), week 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), and week 192 
(n = 3). Fifty-four patients (including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline) 
initially received blinded placebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients followed with tenofovir 
disoproxil (PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group). Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients 
within this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), week 144 (n = 7), and week 192 
(n = 8). No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in 
these isolates. 
In a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0144), genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV 
isolates from patients who received blinded tenofovir disoproxil were available for 9 of 10 patients at 
week 48 who had plasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. Genotypic data from paired baseline and on 
treatment HBV isolates from patients who switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil from blinded 
tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF group) or from placebo (PLB-TDF group) after at least 48 weeks of 
blinded treatment were available for 12 of 16 patients at week 96, 4 of 6 patients at week 144 and 4 of 4 
patients at week 192 who had plasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid substitutions 
associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates by weeks 48, 96, 144 
or 192. 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years of 
age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an optimised 
background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of tenofovir 
disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week 24. 
However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult data and 
comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2).  
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-
score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at 
baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar spine 
BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and 
placebo groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil group 
compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir disoproxil group and one 
adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 
28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 
for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, 
virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either 
replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original regimen 
(n = 49) for 48 weeks. At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 92% 
of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA concentrations 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
< 400 copies/ml. The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained < 400 copies/ml at week 
48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment 
group. When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group 
and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA concentrations 
< 400 copies/ml at week 48. 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received treatment with 
tenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and -
0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline. Mean 
changes at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and 
-0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or zidovudine 
groups, respectively. The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar between the 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. Total body bone 
gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine or zidovudine 
treatment group. One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or zidovudine treated 
subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48. BMD Z-scores declined by 
-0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were treated with tenofovir 
disoproxil for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and weight. 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events. Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings 
clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil 
therapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). 
Chronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients aged 
12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT (≥ 2 x 
ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks. Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir 
disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior to screening) or any 
other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide therapy (> 16 weeks 
prior to screening). At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment 
group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml. Seventy-four 
percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normalised ALT at week 72 compared 
to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group. Response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in 
nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-experienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine-
resistant patients (n = 6). Ninety-five percent of nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide-
experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-resistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at 
week 72. Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-experienced patients had prior lamivudine experience. At 
week 72, 96% (27/28) of immune-active patients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x 
ULN) in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had 
HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml. Seventy-five percent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir 
disoproxil group had normal ALT at week 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. 
After 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment up to week 192. After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those 
receiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir 
disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir 
disoproxil group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 192. Among the subjects who received 
placebo during the double-blind period, the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml rose 
sharply after they began treatment with open-label tenofovir disoproxil (PLB-tenofovir disoproxil 
group): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group had HBV DNA < 400 
copies/ml at week 192. The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the tenofovir 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who were HBeAg positive at 
baseline and 100.0% (2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg negative at baseline. Similar 
percentages of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil and PLB-tenofovir disoproxil 
groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion to anti-HBe through week 192.

In study GS-US-174-0144, 89 HBeAg negative and positive patients aged 2 to < 12 years with chronic 
hepatitis B were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 245 mg (n = 60) 
or placebo (n = 29) once daily for 48 weeks. Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir disoproxil, with 
HBV DNA > 105 copies/ml (~ 4.2 log10 IU/ml) and ALT > 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 
screening. At Week 48, 77% (46 of 60) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 7% (2 
of 29) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (69 IU/ml). Sixty-six percent (38 
of 58) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normalized ALT at week 48 compared with 15% 
(4 of 27) in the placebo group. Twenty-five percent (14 of 56) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil 
group and 24% (7 of 29) of patients in the placebo group achieved HBeAg seroconversion at Week 48. 
Response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced subjects with 76% (38/50) of treatment-naïve and 80% (8/10) of 
treatment-experienced subjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (69 IU/ml) at Week 
48. Response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was also similar in subjects who were 
HBeAg-negative compared with those who were HBeAg positive at baseline with 77% 
(43/56) HBeAg positive and 75.0% (3/4) HBeAg-negative subjects achieving HBV DNA 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
< 400 copies/ml (69 IU/ml) at Week 48. The distribution of HBV genotypes at baseline 
was similar between the TDF and Placebo groups. The majority of subjects were either 
genotypes C (43.8%) or D (41.6%) with a lower and similar frequency of genotypes A and 
B (6.7% each). Only 1 subject randomized to the TDF group was genotype E at baseline. In 
general, treatment responses to tenofovir disoproxil were similar for genotypes A, B, C and 
E [75-100% of subjects achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (69 IU/ml) at Week 48] with 
a lower response rate in subjects with genotype D infection (55%). 
After at least 48 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment up to week 192. After week 48, virologic suppression was maintained for 
those receiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-
TDF group): 83.3% (50/60) of subjects in the TDF-TDF group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (69 
IU/ml) at week 192. Among the subjects who received placebo during the double-blind period, the 
proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml rose was sharply after receiving treatment with 
open-label TDF (PLB-TDF group): 62.1% (18/29) of subjects in the PLB-TDF group had HBV DNA 
< 400 copies/ml at week 192. The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the 
TDF-TDF and PLB-TDF groups 79.3% and 59.3%, respectively (based on central laboratory criteria). 
Similar percentages of subjects in the TDF-TDF and PLB-TDF groups (33.9% and 34.5%, respectively) 
had experienced HBeAg seroconversion through week 192. No subjects in either treatment group had 
experienced HBsAg seroconversion at week 192. Treatment response rates to tenofovir disoproxil at 
week 192 were maintained for all genotypes A, B and C (80-100%) in the TDF-TDF group. At week 
192 a lower response rate is still observed in subjects with genotype D infection (77%) but with an 
improvement compared to 48 week results (55%).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
tenofovir disoproxil in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HIV and chronic hepatitis B 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Tenofovir disoproxil is a water soluble ester prodrug which is rapidly converted in vivo to tenofovir and 
formaldehyde. 
Tenofovir is converted intracellularly to tenofovir monophosphate and to the active component, 
tenofovir diphosphate. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV infected patients, tenofovir disoproxil is 
rapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir. Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil 
with a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of 
326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng*h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively. Maximum tenofovir 
concentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two hours 
when taken with food. The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted patients

was approximately 25%. Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a high fat meal enhanced the oral 
bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax by approximately 
14%. Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, the median Cmax in serum ranged 
from 213 to 375 ng/ml. However, administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a light meal did not have a 
significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was estimated 
to be approximately 800 ml/kg. After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir is distributed 
to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the intestinal contents 
(preclinical studies). In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was less than 0.7 
and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/ml. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the 
CYP450 enzymes. Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than those 
observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major human 
CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, or 
CYP1A1/2). Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any of the CYP450 
isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction in metabolism of 
CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed. Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically significant 
interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 would 
occur. 
Elimination 
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system 
with approximately 70 - 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous 
administration. Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately 
300 ml/min). Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately 
210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular 
secretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir. Following oral administration the terminal 
half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. 
Studies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into proximal 
tubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into the urine by the 
multidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose range 75 
to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. 
Age 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in the elderly (over 65 years of age). 
Gender 
Limited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. 
Ethnicity 
Pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1: Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg. Mean (± SD) Cmax and AUCtau are 
0.38 ± 0.13 μg/ml and 3.39 ± 1.22 μg h/ml, respectively. Tenofovir exposure achieved in adolescent 
patients receiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in 
adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. 
Chronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients (12 to 
< 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to exposures 
achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. 
Tenofovir exposure in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age receiving an oral daily 
dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or granules) up to a maximum dose of 
245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age 
receiving a once daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg tablets in children 
under 12 years or with renal impairment. 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of 
tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees of 
renal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function when 
CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with CrCl = 30 - 49 ml/min and severe 
with CrCl = 10 - 29 ml/min). Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean (%CV) 
tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/min to 
respectively 3,064 (30%) ng h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng h/ml in patients with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment. The dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment, 
with increased dosing interval, are expected to result in higher peak plasma concentrations and lower 
Cmin levels in patients with renal impairment compared with patients with normal renal function. The 
clinical implications of this are unknown. 
In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 10 ml/min) requiring haemodialysis, between 
dialysis tenofovir concentrations substantially increased over 48 hours achieving a mean Cmax of 
1,032 ng/ml and a mean AUC0-48h of 42,857 ng h/ml. 
It is recommended that the dosing interval for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg is modified in adult patients 
with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or in patients who already have ESRD and require dialysis (see 
section 4.2).  
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min 
and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not been studied. 
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied. 
No data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
A single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult 
patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) 
classification. Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic 
impairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects. The mean (%CV) tenofovir 
Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, in normal 
subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with moderate 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Intracellular pharmacokinetics 
In non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir 
diphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in 
phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans. Findings in repeated 
dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical 
exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a 
decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) 
and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats and 
dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred 
in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the 
exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-
related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. 
Genotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results in 
one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat 
hepatocytes. However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. 
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an 
extremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. 
Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal 
parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in 
peri-postnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
The active substance tenofovir disoproxil phosphate and its main transformation products are persistent 
in the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
If Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in 
this leaflet is addressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). 
1. 
What Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is and what it is used for 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil. This active substance is 
an antiretroviral or antiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both. Tenofovir is 
a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with 
the normal working of enzymes (in HIV reverse transcriptase; in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are 
essential for the viruses to reproduce themselves. In HIV Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should always be 
used combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. 
The tablets are suitable for: 
• 
• 
adults 
adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who have already been treated with other HIV 
medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, or have caused 
side effects. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV 
(hepatitis B virus). The tablets are suitable for: 
• 
• 
adults 
adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years. 
You do not have to have HIV to be treated with Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for HBV. 
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva you may 
still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You can also pass on HBV to others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other 
people. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  
Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  
• 
If you are allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil phosphate or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately and do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  
• 
• 
• 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva does not reduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through sexual 
contact or blood contamination. You must continue to take precautions to avoid this. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown 
problems with your kidneys. Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be given to adolescents 
with existing kidney problems. Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to 
assess your kidney function. Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may affect your kidneys during 
treatment. Your doctor may order blood tests during treatment to monitor how your kidneys work. 
If you are an adult, your doctor may advise you to take the tablets less often. Do not reduce the 
prescribed dose, unless your doctor has told you to do so.  
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your 
kidneys (see Other medicines and Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva). If this is unavoidable, your 
doctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. 
Bone problems. Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may 
develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply 
to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches 
and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any 
of these symptoms tell your doctor. 
For adult patients: 
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss was seen 
in clinical studies when patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with a 
boosted protease inhibitor. 
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long-term bone health and future fracture risk 
in adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.  
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are 
at a higher risk for fractures. 
For adolescents/paediatric patients: 
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting 
in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects). Tell your child’s doctor if your child has bone pain or fractures. 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss was seen 
in clinical studies when patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with 
a boosted protease inhibitor. 
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk 
in adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.  
Tell your child’s doctor if your child suffers from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are 
at a higher risk for fractures. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  
Patients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, 
have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have hepatitis B 
infection, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you. If you have a history of 
liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests to monitor your 
liver function. 
Look out for infections. If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and have an infection, you 
may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of an 
existing infection once treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is started. These symptoms 
may indicate that your body’s improved immune system is fighting infection. Look out for signs 
of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. If you 
notice signs of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor at once. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the 
start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle 
weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the 
body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are over 65. Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva has not 
been studied in patients over 65 years of age. If you are older than this and are prescribed 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, your doctor will monitor you carefully.

Children and adolescents 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is suitable for: 
• 
HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg and who 
have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to 
development of resistance, or have caused side effects 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
HBV infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not suitable for the following groups: 
• 
Not for HIV-1 infected children under 12 years of age. 
• 
Not for HBV infected children under 12 years of age.  
For dosage see section 3, How to take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
Other medicines and Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Do not stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your doctor when you start Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva if you have both HBV and HIV. 
Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva if you are already taking other medicines containing 
tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva together 
with medicines containing adefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). 
It is very important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may damage 
your kidneys. 
These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection) 
amphotericin B (for fungal infection) 
foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection) 
interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) 
adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV) 
tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system) 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) 
Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in 
your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic 
acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported 
when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor 
will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine 
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C 
infection. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with food and drink  
Take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with food (for example, a meal or a snack). 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
• 
If you have taken Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva during your pregnancy, your doctor may 
request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. 
In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. 
For adult patients: 
• 
If you are a mother with HBV, and your baby has been given treatment to prevent hepatitis B 
transmission at birth, you may be able to breast-feed your infant, but first talk to your doctor to 
get more information. 
• 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, 
you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible. 
For adolescents/paediatric patients: 
• 
If your child has HBV, and their baby has been given treatment to prevent hepatitis B 
transmission at birth, your child may be able to breast-feed their infant, but first talk to your 
child’s doctor to get more information. 
• 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in mothers living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk. If your child is breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-
feeding, talk to your child’s doctor as soon as possible. 
Driving and using machines 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy while taking Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva, do not drive or ride a bicycle and do not use any tools or machines. 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains lactose monohydrate

3. 
How to take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is: 
• 
• 
Adults: 1 tablet each day with food (for example, a meal or a snack). 
Adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: 1 tablet each day with 
food (for example, a meal or a snack).

the powder with about 100 ml (half a glass) of water, orange juice or grape juice and drink immediately. 
• 
Always take the dose recommended by your doctor. This is to make sure that your medicine is 
fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. Do not change the 
dose unless your doctor tells you to. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
If you are an adult and have problems with your kidneys, your doctor may advise you to take 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva less frequently. 
If you have HBV your doctor may offer you an HIV test to see if you have both HBV and HIV.  
Refer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those 
medicines. 
If you take more Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva than you should 
If you accidentally take too many Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva tablets, you may be at increased risk of 
experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). Contact your 
doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can 
easily describe what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  
It is important not to miss a dose of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
If you miss a dose of Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, work out how long since you should have taken it.  
• 
• 
If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take your 
next dose at its regular time. 
If it is more than 12 hours since you should have taken it, forget about the missed dose. Wait 
and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
tablet. 
If you throw up less than 1 hour after taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, take another tablet. You 
do not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva. 
If you stop taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  
Do not stop taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva without your doctor’s advice. Stopping treatment with 
Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may reduce the effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your 
doctor. 
If you have hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection), it is very important not to 
stop your Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva treatment without talking to your doctor first. Some patients 
have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva. You may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. In some 
patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may 
lead to worsening of your hepatitis. 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor before you stop taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for any reason, 
particularly if you are experiencing any side effects or you have another illness. 
Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
Contact your doctor before you restart taking Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva tablets. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

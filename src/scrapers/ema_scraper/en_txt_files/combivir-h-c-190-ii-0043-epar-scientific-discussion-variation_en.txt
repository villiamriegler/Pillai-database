SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1 
 Introduction 
There is a need for anti-HIV drugs for children acknowledged by a number of organisations including 
WHO  and  UNICEF.  In  response  to  these  calls  the  Paediatric  Expert  Group  (PEG),  created  by  the 
CPMP in July 2001, completed an assessment of the paediatric needs for anti-HIV drugs in Europe. In 
this  evaluation  numerous  limitations  were  identified  which  could  damage  treatment  compliance  in 
children.  Oral  solutions  have  limitations  insofar  as  they  often present  a  bad  taste;  they  require  large 
volumes in older children; they may contain some excipients hazardous for children and they present 
some  logistic  problems  (small  bottles,  refrigeration…).  These  limitations  are  especially  critical  in 
resource-poor  settings.  As  a  conclusion  of  this  evaluation,  it  was  considered  that  the  Marketing 
Authorisation  Holders  (MAHs)  should  be  further  encouraged  to  develop  small  tablets  with  lower 
strength  for  children  able  to  swallow  tablets  and  GSK  was  informed  of  this  request  in  2004.  As  a 
response, the MAH proposed to pursue the development of scored tablets for Combivir tablets, which 
is the scope of this submission. 
This  Type  II  variation  concerns  the  MAH’s  proposal  to  extend  the  approved  indication  to  register 
Combivir scored tablet formulation intended for use in children weighting 14 kg or more. 
The proposed indication is: 
“Combivir  is  indicated  in  antiretroviral  combination  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (see section 4.2).” 
The proposed posology for this new Combivir formulation is: 
Children weight 
Children weighing at least 30 kg 
Children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg 
Children weighing between 14 kg to 21 kg 
Posology 
One whole tablet twice daily 
One half tablet in the morning 
One whole tablet in the evening 
One half tablet twice daily 
These  proposed  dosing  recommendations  for  lamivudine  in  the  fixed-dose  combination  Combivir 
tablet are consistent with those approved for paediatric use of Epivir (lamivudine) tablets. 
The currently approved dosing recommendations for Retrovir (zidovudine) for paediatric use are based 
on body surface area (BSA) and dosed three times daily.  
The  MAH  proposes  to  switch  from  a  three  times  daily  dosage  based  on  BSA  to  a  twice  daily 
zidovudine dosage based on body weight.  
The  MAH  proposed  to  submit  an  EU  Mutual  Recognition  Type  II  variation  to  update  the  Retrovir 
product information with the new zidovudine dosage regimen, once the variation for this extension of 
indication for Combivir scored tablets is approved.  
The proposed Combivir scored tablets are identical to the current non-scored tablets except for 
the  addition  of  the  breakline  and  introduction  of  the  mark  on  both  sides.  The  MAH  has  planned  to 
replace the non-scored tablets by the scored tablets, as soon as this new formulation will be approved. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposes to update section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” of the SPC to be 
harmonised  with  the  Product  Information  (PI)  of  Epivir  and  Retrovir  and  to  include  new 
pharmacokinetic data on children.  
This  variation  includes  Quality  and  Clinical  data.  No  new  clinical  data  has  been  generated  in 
support  of  the  scored  tablet  application;  existing  data  have  merely  been  re-analysed  to  determine 
suitable paediatric doses.

Quality aspects 
The  MAH  applied  to  register  scored  Combivir  tablets.  It  is  the  MAH’s  intention  to  replace  the 
currently  registered  non-scored  tablets  with  the  scored  Combivir  tablets.  The  proposed  tablets  are 
white to off-white, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets engraved with “GXFC3” and with a score line 
on each face of the tablet. 
The introduction of the score line and additional engraving will result only in a change of appearance 
of the tablets (no changes to the qualitative or quantitative composition of the finished product were 
proposed). Batch analysis data and dissolution profile results indicate that the addition of the score line 
has  not  compromised  product  quality.  The  formulation  composition  and  processing  conditions  of 
commercial scale for tablets with the selected breakline meet the specifications of the commercial non-
scored  tablets.  The  proposed  scored  tablets  are  equivalent  to  currently  marketed  non-scored  tablets. 
The  proposed  change  has  been  supported  by  appropriate  pharmaceutical  development  (selection  of 
breakline design), process validation and stability studies.

Non-clinical aspects 
3.1 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
Scored  tablets  are  intended  to  replace  the  non-scored  tablets  or  the  use  of  liquid  formulations  of 
lamivudine and zidovudine. Therefore in agreement with the MAH proposal the CHMP concluded that 
there was no relevant additional environmental burden associated with this submission.

Clinical aspects 
4.1 
Clinical efficacy 
Combivir  (150  mg  lamivudine  plus  300  mg  zidovudine)  is  not  currently  indicated  for  use  in  HIV-
infected paediatric patients less than 12 years old of age because it is a fixed-dose combination that 
cannot be adjusted based on body size for this patient population. 
The currently recommended dosage for zidovudine and lamivudine in paediatrics are: 
- 
- 
zidovudine (children from 3 months to 12 years of age):  360 to 480 mg/m² per day, in 3 or 4 
divided  doses.  The  maximum  dosage  should  not  exceed  200 mg  every  6  hours.  Of  note,  the 
recommended dose in adults is 500 or 600 mg/day in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
lamivudine (children from 3 months to 12 years of age):  4  mg/kg  twice  daily,  up  to  a 
maximum of 300 mg daily. 
Based  on  the  re-analysis  of  existing  data  the  MAH  has  proposed  for  Combivir  tablets  the  following 
posology:  
Children weight 
Children weighing at least 30 kg 
Children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg 
Children weighing between 14 kg to 21 kg 
Posology 
One whole tablet twice daily 
One half tablet in the morning 
One whole tablet in the evening 
One half tablet twice daily 
4.1.1 
Zidovudine 
4.1.1.1  Change from zidovudine BSA-based to weight based dosing 
Weight-based are simplified regimens and therefore the MAH proposed to switch from a BSA-based 
dosing  for  zidovudine  to  a  weight-based  dosing.  For  this  purpose,  the  MAH  has  first  extracted  the 
values  of  height  at  the  5th,  50th,  and  95th  percentile  for  a  given  body  weight  from  the  CDC  Growth 
Charts  and  then  determined  the  corresponding  BSA  values  for  a  given  body  weight,  using  various 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
calculation methods. Among these calculation functions, the Mosteller equation (see table 1) is the one 
preferred by UNICEF/WHO, as it is the easiest to use. 
Then,  the  daily  zidovudine  doses  base  on  the  approved  regimens  (360  to  480  mg/m²  daily)  were 
calculated. Based on these results a proposal was made for daily mg/kg zidovudine doses, which are 
within the range from 360mg/m²/day at the 5th percentile BSA to 480mg/m²/day at the 95th percentile: 
Body weight 
Zidovudine regimen 
4 to < 9 kg 
24 mg/kg/day (8 mg/kg TID) 
≥ 9 to < 30 kg 
18 mg/kg/day (6 mg/kg TID) 
≥ 30 kg* 
200 mg TID (approved dose for ≥ 12 years old) 
* 30 kg is the 5th percentile of body weight for 12 years old 
TID: three times a day 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.1.1.2  Change from zidovudine dosing three times per day to twice daily 
The  MAH  did  not  provide  any  new  efficacy  clinical  data  to  support  the  change  from  the  approved 
three  or  four  times  daily  dosing  of  zidovudine  to  the  proposed  twice  daily  dosing.  Only  a 
pharmacokinetic study conducted in 6 HIV-infected children from 2 to 13 years of age together with 
new analysis of the available data was submitted by the MAH. Table 2 summarises the results of this 
pharmacokinetic study.

The  results  indicate  that  a  TID  and  a  BID  (twice  a  day)  regimen  of  zidovudine  show  comparable 
pharmacokinetics profiles. However, the demonstration is only based on data derived from 6 patients. 
Moreover,  given  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  zidovudine,  active  after  an  intracellular 
phosphorylation, it would have been of value to have intracellular pharmacokinetic data collected. 
To further substantiate the twice-daily regimen for zidovudine proposed for children, the MAH states 
that the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing in adults is well established and that in children with 
more  than  5-6  months  of  age,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  zidovudine  is  similar  to  that  in  adults 
(with  similar  plasma  terminal  elimination  half-life  (about  1.5  hours)  and  similar  process  of 
intracellular  phosphorylation).  Moreover,  the  MAH  argues  that  clinical  studies  as  CNAA30061  and 
PENTA 52 have investigated zidovudine as a twice daily regimen in children. 
Therefore, the following weight-based zidovudine doses for twice daily regimens are proposed by the 
MAH, based on maintenance of the same total daily dose (e.g., 240mg/m² BID vs 160mg/m² TID, or 
180mg/m² BID vs 120mg/m² TID): 
Body weight 
Zidovudine regimen (BID) 
4 to < 9 kg 
24 mg/kg/day (12 mg/kg BID) 
≥ 9 to < 30 kg 
18 mg/kg/day (9 mg/kg BID) 
≥ 30 kg* 
300 mg BID (approved dose for ≥ 12 years old) 
*30 kg is the 5th percentile of body weight for 12 years old 
To support its proposal, the MAH underlined that the PENTA group3 and the WHO have developed 
treatment guidelines with a zidovudine regimen based on a twice daily administration. 
1 Study CNAA3006 evaluated the efficacy and safety of zidovudine 180 mg/m2 twice daily plus lamivudine 4 
mg/kg twice daily, with or without abacavir over 48 weeks in 205 children ranging at enrolment from 0.6 to 13 
years of age. 
2 Penta 5 study evaluated  safety and efficacy over 48 weeks in children from 0.3 to 16.5 years of age.

Weight-based twice daily regimen for zidovudine: study PACTG 152 
In  order  to  further  substantiate  the  weight-based  twice  daily  regimen  for  zidovudine,  the  MAH  has 
provided estimates of pharmacokinetics data (AUC and Cmax) for zidovudine obtained from different 
calculations  derived  from  a  population  pharmacokinetic  model  obtained  from  a  population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  data  in  study  PACTG  152  (in  which  two  regimens  of  zidovudine  were 
explored:180 mg/m² and 120 mg/m², every 6 hours). 
The exposures (daily AUC) from both mg/m² and mg/kg dosing were calculated using weight-based 
clearance values from the model. 
The  figure  below  shows  that  the  calculated  AUCs  on  a  weight-based  dosing  regimen  are  comprised 
within the range of calculated AUC on a BSA-based dosing regimen The two drops in AUC are due to 
the  change  in  proposed  dose  recommendation  at  8  kg  body  weight  and  to  a  step  function  at  12  kg 
(taken as typical weight for a 2-year old) for the effect of age in the clearance model. 
Monte  Carlo  simulations  were  performed  to  predict  zidovudine  exposures  (daily  AUC  and  steady-
state Cmax) for the proposed weight-based (mg/kg) doses in children using this population PK model. 
The results are presented in table 3 below.

Post-hoc  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimates  from  individual  patients  were  used  to  calculate  AUC 
and Cmax for both BSA and body-weight based dosing 
The AUC value was increased by about 2 to 3 fold in children compared to historical data in adults 
(study  NZTA1014).  The  Cmax  value  was  also  increased  in  children  compared  to  historical  data  in 
adults. The MAH explains this finding by the larger variability observed in paediatric patients.  
As expected, the Cmax values were higher for the twice daily regimen than for the three times daily 
regimen. 
The MAH has performed new simulations based on the revised population PK model. The results are 
presented in the table below.

The results are better in line with the results extracted from reanalyses of clinical studies. Moreover, 
the revised model confirms the high Cmax values. 
Discussion 
Change from zidovudine BSA-based to weight based dosing 
The CHMP agrees that dosing recommendations based on body-weight are preferred to those based on 
BSA for practical reasons. Based to the MAH’s demonstration the switch from BSA to weight based 
dosing regimen can be accepted. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Change from zidovudine dosing three times per day to twice daily  
The results indicate that a TID and a BID regimen of zidovudine show comparable pharmacokinetics 
profiles. However, the demonstration is only based on data derived from 6 patients. Moreover, given 
the pharmacodynamic properties of zidovudine, active after an intracellular phosphorylation, it would 
have been of value to have intracellular pharmacokinetic data collected. 
The  CHMP  recognises  that  the  BID  regimen  of  zidovudine  in  paediatric  patients  is  widely  used  in 
clinical practice and the recent WHO/PENTA support has reinforced such an use, as well as national 
guidelines.  However,  it  is  regrettable  that  the  MAH  could  not  provide  clinical  efficacy  data  to 
substantiate  the  proposed  new  dosage  recommendations  for  zidovudine  in  children  (as  regards  the 
twice daily regimen and the BSA-dosed dosing).  
the  calculations  of 
The  pharmacokinetic  data  for  zidovudine  were  reassuring.  However, 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  study  PACTG  152  for  zidovudine  showed  that  the  AUC  value  was 
increased  by  about  2  to  3  fold  in  children  compared  to  historical  data  in  adults  (study  NZTA101,  a 
pivotal bioequivalence trial conducted in 24 adults receiving 300 mg zidovudine BID).  
The MAH 's explanation for the simulated 2-3 fold increased exposure of zidovudine was an observed 
increased variability in the paediatric population. As could be seen from the simulations in table 3 the 
variability  was  higher  in  the  paediatric  groups  (simulated  variability  in  AUC  around  50%CV  as 
compared  to  29%CV  observed  in  adults.  It  is  difficult  to  see  that  the  difference  in  variability  could 
explain a 2-3 fold difference in mean AUC. 
Upon  CHMP  request  the  MAH  has  performed  different  analyses  and  compared  results  to  observed 
exposure  in  children  with  the  currently  approved dose  recommendations  and  to  adult  exposure, 
including  inter-individual  variability.  The  results  confirm  the  high  Cmax  values  for  zidovudine  in 
children. These findings pointed out the usefulness to perform clinical studies in special populations 
such  as  paediatric  patients.  Pharmacokinetic  simulations  might  not  always  be  sufficient  to  provide 
reassurance on efficacy and safety, as the optimal model might be difficult to define. 
4.1.2  
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine  pharmacokinetics  in  paediatric  patients  is  in  general  similar  to  adults.  However,  two 
characteristics deserve to be underlined: 
-Absolute bioavailabilty is reduced in paediatric patients below 12 years of age (F ranging from 55 
to 65%) compared to adult patients (F ranging from 80 to 85%). 
-Systemic  clearance  is  higher  in  younger  patients  and  decreased  with  age,  approaching  values 
around 12 years of age. 
Recent  findings  from  study  NUCA2002  (included  in  the  original  paediatric  MAA  submission)  and 
from  the  recent  study  PENTA  135  have  shown  that  patients  below  6  years  of  age  presented  AUC 
values  reduced  by  30%  compared  with  other  age  groups.  These  findings  gave  rise  to  an  update  of 
section  5.2  of  the  SPC  for  Epivir  (variation  II/61,  positive  Opinion  adopted  in  January  2007,  by 
CHMP). 
In  order  to  further  investigate  whether  certain  age  groups  of  paediatric  patients  have  poorer  oral 
absorption  of  solid  oral  formulations  compared  to  liquids,  pharmacokinetic  data  from  original 
paediatric  lamivudine  trial,  NUCA2002,  was  re-examined.  In  this  study  absolute  bioavailability  of 
lamivudine in paediatric patients was determined with patients receiving single doses of either an oral 
solution,  capsule,  and  tablet  formulation  compared  to  an  intravenous  formulation.  A  scatterplot  of 
absolute bioavailability versus age for the different formulations is shown in figure 2.

lamivudine and abacavir where one or both drugs are being taken as part of combination antiretroviral therapy 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
Figure 2 shows that when presenting the oral bioavailability by formulation and by age, there is a trend 
for  increased  oral  bioavailability  with  age.  As  regards  the  value  of  bioavailability  as  a  function  of 
formulation, no clear trend is apparent. 
4.1.3 
Dosing recommendations for use of Combivir scored tablets in paediatrics 
From the daily zidovudine doses calculated in table 1, and based on a twice daily regimen, it appears 
that the 150 mg zidovudine contained in a half-tablet of Combivir would be an appropriate dose for 
children weighing from about 14 to 22 kg. 
As regards lamivudine, over the 14 to 22 kg weight range, a 75 mg lamivudine dose contained in a 
half-tablet of Combivir would deviate from the nominal 4 mg/kg dose by +34% at the low end of the 
body weight range (14 kg) and by -15% at the high end of the weight range (22 kg). To avoid a dose 
that is more than about 10% below the nominal 4 mg/kg dose, the upper weight limit was decreased to 
21  kg.  Because  of  the  favourable  safety  profile  of  lamivudine,  there  is  no  concern  in  exceeding  the 
nominal dose by 34% at the lower end of the proposed weight range (14 kg). 
Similarly, it is proposed that patients weighing at least 30 kg may safely receive the full 150 mg tablet 
dose of lamivudine twice daily (+25% compared to the 4 mg/kg recommended dose). 
In order to explore the dosing recommendations for Combivir, the MAH has performed Monte Carlo 
simulations based on population pharmacokinetic modelling to estimate the exposures of zidovudine 
and lamivudine for the following Combivir regimens: 
Regimen/ 
Body weight 
Regimen 1 
Regimen 2 
Regimen 3 
14 to ≤ 21 kg  
>21 to 30 kg  
One half tablet twice daily 
One half tablet AM 
One whole tablet PM 
One half tablet three times daily 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of these simulations are presented in table 5.

The  results  of  the  simulations  showed  for  both  actives  and  regardless  of  dosing  regimen  that  AUCs 
were slightly increased in the > 21-30 kg group compared to the 14-21 kg group. 
As  expected  the  Cmaxs  were  higher  in  the  regimen  2  (0.5  tablet  AM  +  1  tablet  PM)  than  in  the 
regimen 3 (0.5 tablet three time a day). The MAH has discussed the potential alteration of the safety 
profile related to the higher Cmax values. The well known safety profile for lamivudine gives some 
reassurance.  For  zidovudine,  the  percentage  of  patients  who  experience  adverse  events  such  as 
gastrointestinal  events  (which  are  believed  to  be  associated  with  plasma  concentrations)  may  be 
increased.  It  is  unlikely  that  haematological  events  (i.e  anemia)  would  be  increased  as  they  are 
considered to be associated with overall exposure (AUC). 
In  general,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  exposure  in  children  are  modestly  higher  than  in  adults. 
Lamivudine  adult  exposures  (mean  (CV%))  are  Cmax:  1.22  ug/ml  (24%),  AUC0-24:  9.4  ug.h/ml 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(27%)  [EPV10001]  and  zidovudine  adult  exposures  (mean  (CV%))  are  Cmax:  2.01  ug/ml  (40%), 
AUC0-24: 4.8 ug.h/ml (29%) [NTZA1001]. 
Monte  Carlo  Simulations  based  on  the  revised  population  PK  model  were  performed  to  predict 
zidovudine  exposure  for  the  proposed  dosing  regimens  of  scored  Combivir.  Results  show  that 
zidovudine  AUC  values  simulated  are  consistent  across  the  3  weight-ranges  and  are  consistent  with 
the historical paediatric data (for the higher zidovudine dosing regimen i.e 160 mg/m²). 
Cmax values are higher than the historical data and even more especially in the 21-30 kg weight-range 
as expected due to the inhomogeneous dosing regimen. 
As Monte Carlo Simulation tended to predict higher zidovudine exposure, especially Cmax, PK data 
in paediatrics from study P53-04 and post-hoc model parameter estimates from PACTG 152 were re-
analysed to predict zidovudine exposure (daily AUC and Cmax) from scored Combivir tablets. 
When  comparing  predicted  zidovudine  exposure  for  the  scored  tablet  from  different  methods, 
predicted zidovudine daily AUC for scored tablet by weight band are generally in agreement among 
the  results  from  Monte  Carlo  Simulation,  re-analysis  of  P53-04  (limited  sample  size),  and  PACTG 
152. Predicted zidovudine Cmax for scored tablet by Monte Carlo Simulation are on average 41% and 
10%  higher  than  those  from  PACTG  152  in  the  weight  group  of  14-<21kg,  and  21-<30kg, 
respectively. 
When  comparing  predicted  zidovudine  exposure  for  the  scored  tablet  to  adults  and  paediatric  data 
from  currently  approved  zidovudine  dosing  regimens,  predicted  zidovudine  daily  AUC  for  scored 
tablet  are  higher  than  adult  data  from  300mg  BID  and  paediatric  data  from  120mg/m²  TID,  but  are 
similar to paediatric data from 160mg/m² BID. 
Predicted  zidovudine  Cmax  by  Monte  Carlo  Simulation  for  the  proposed  scored  tablet  dosing 
regimens are on average 33% and 62% higher amongst children weighing 14-<21kg, and 21-<30kg, 
respectively, when compared to adults receiving 300mg BID. Predicted zidovudine Cmax for scored 
tablet  by  reanalysis  of  PACTG  152  are  similar  to  adult  and paediatric  data  from  currently  approved 
zidovudine  regimens  in  the  weight  band  of  14-<21kg,  while  predicted  zidovudine  Cmax  in  the  21-
<30kg weight are 50% higher than adults and 86% higher than paediatric patients receiving 160mg/m² 
q8h. 
It was noted that the MAH has initially submitted simulations in the group with unequal doses that did 
not reflect a 12 hours dose interval but rather was based on doses separated by 8 hours. The MAH has 
submitted  simulations  taking  into  account  a  dosing  interval  of  12  hours,  which  does  not  change  the 
conclusions. 
Proposed posology for Combivir: 
Based  on  the  results  of  simulations  and  taking  into  account  the  2006  WHO  recommendations,  the 
MAH has proposed the following dosage recommendations for children over 14 kg: 
Children weight 
Children weighing at least 30 kg 
Children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg 
Posology 
One whole tablet twice daily 
One half tablet in the morning 
One whole tablet in the evening 
One half tablet twice daily 
Children weighing between 14 kg to 21 kg 
Discussion 
All  the  results  confirm  that  Cmax  are  higher  and  this  is  more  relevant  with  the  regimen  half  tablet 
AM/one tablet PM. Therefore, the main concern as regards the regimens proposed by the MAH is to 
determine whether or not the variations of plasma concentrations subsequent to the administration of 
inhomogeneous dosing for children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg (i.e an half tablet in the morning 
and a whole tablet in the evening) could alter the safety and efficacy profiles of the drugs. 
It is all the more critical that such an inhomogeneous dosing regimen is questionable specially taking 
into consideration the poor compliance to anti-HIV multitherapy.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  Cmax  values,  the  MAH  recognised  that  there  is  a  concern  regarding  the  safety  of  the 
proposed  dosing  regimen.  This  concern  must  not  be  neglected,  since  the  impact  on  the  safety  (and 
efficacy/adherence) of the scored tablets clearly depends on the type of adverse event. For example, an 
increase in vomiting can be assumed to have a greater impact than an increased incidence of nausea. 
However,  it  is  known  that  gastrointestinal  (GI)  adverse  events  of  zidovudine  decrease  over  time. 
Therefore, the MAH was requested to carefully evaluate these events in a post-marketing study (e.g. in 
an  observational  cohort)  and,  if  necessary,  explore  a  regimen  for  diminishing  these  events  (e.g.  by 
either taking 3 x ½ tablet or by starting zidovudine therapy with the oral solution and switching to the 
tablet formulation after a few weeks). The MAH committed to submit a proactive pharmacovigilance 
survey and to submit a safety review focusing on Combivir paediatric scored tablets every 6 month. 
Within this variation the SPC is updated in order to warn prescribers for the possibly increased risk of 
adverse events. A respective statement on the possibility to change the dosing schedule in case of GI-
intolerance by taking 3 x ½ tablet Combivir /day is inserted. Furthermore, results from Arrow study 
are  expected.  These  issues  are  further  discussed  in  the  following  safety  and  pharmacovigilance 
sections. 
4.2 
Clinical safety 
No new safety data have been generated specifically with the scored tablets of Combivir. 
Data on treatment with the combination of the components zidovudine/lamivudine in patients less than 
12 years of age is provided by the randomised, doubleblind, study CNAA3006 (n=205). However, this 
study  in  children  aged  between  six  months  and  13  years  did  not  evaluate  the  new  formulation  of 
Combivir which is proposed in this current application, i.e. the tablets with a scored break line. 
Study CNAA3006 compared Combivir + abacavir (n=102) to Combivir alone (n=103). Results show 
that less than 10% of participants in each arm experienced a treatment limiting adverse events (AE); 
nausea/ vomiting were the AE most frequently associated with Combivir + abacavir, were generally 
transient and did not lead to discontinuation of the study drug. Furthermore, incidences of grades 3 and 
4 hepatic, haematologic, pancreatic, and renal toxicities occurred infrequently in both arms 
In addition study APV29005, which investigated subjects aged 2 to 18 years receiving different dosing 
regimes  of  boosted  and  unboosted  Fosamprenavir,  once  a  day  (QD)  and  twice  a  day  (BID)  dosing 
(Fosamprenavir  BID,  Fosamprenavir  /Ritonavir  BID,  oral  suspension  or  tablets)  included  seven 
subjects treated with zidovudine/lamivudine). 
These  studies  did  not  suggest 
zidovudine/lamivudine in children under the age of 12 years compared with adolescents and adults.

Pharmacovigilance system   
5.1 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
As an enlarged paediatric population will be exposed with this new formulation the CHMP requested 
the  MAH  to  submit  a  RMP  for  Combivir  scored  tablets.  The  RMP  should  take  into  account  the 
efficacy  and  safety  concerns  related  to  the  use  of  Combivir  in  this  new  paediatric  population,  as 
detailed in this assessment report. Furthermore, the MAH should consider an educational program for 
prescribers and parents or caregivers to ensure that the dosing regimen should be applied as indicated. 
The MAH has submitted a RMP and identified the following important potential risks with the use of 
Combivir paediatric scored tablet: 
▪ Dosing recommendations resulting in over exposure 
The pharmacokinetic population PK model that was used as the basis for the Monte Carlo simulations 
provides  good  predictions  of  AUC(0-24)  values,  however,  Cmax  values  then  tend  to  be  biased  to 
higher values. It is important to note that current dosing recommendations for paediatric patients result 
in higher exposures than exposures for adults. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
▪ Inhomogeneous dosing regimen in children weighing 21 to 30 kg 
In the pharmacokinetic population PK model, Cmax for both lamivudine and zidovudine were higher 
for the Half tab/Full tablet regimen, for the > 21 to 30 Kg weight group, compared to the homogenous 
TID regimen. 
-  about  zidovudine  safety,  increased  zidovudine  Cmax  may  increase  the  percentage  of  patients  who 
experience  adverse  effects  such  as  gastrointestinal  events,  which  are  more  generally  believed  to  be 
associated  with  plasma  concentrations;  if  gastrointestinal  intolerance  occurs,  then  a  0.5  tablet  three 
times a day(TID) regimen with lower Cmax values may improve tolerability, however it is noted that 
this  regimen  would  be  less  patient  friendly;  conversely,  it  is  unlikely  that  zidovudine  associated 
haematological events (e.g. anaemia) would increase as this is generally considered  more associated 
with overall exposure (AUC). 
- about zidovudine efficacy, the potential effect on efficacy and development of resistance is expected 
to be minimal if any, since phosphorylation steps would not be affected and taking into consideration 
the half-life for zidovudine-TP (~ 7 hours) which should be sufficient to  maintain efficacious levels 
with  minimal  risk  for  the  development  of  resistance.  This  is  supported  in  part  by  a  study  which 
examined the short term viral load decline following monotherapy of zidovudine administered as 600 
mg once daily versus 300 mg twice daily which demonstrated similar viral load declines over 14 days. 
-  about  lamivudine  safety,  the  increase  in  lamivudine  AUC  and  Cmax  is  not  considered  to  have 
clinical relevance with respect to adverse events, regarding results of the original dose ranging study in 
pediatrics that examined larger doses up to 10 mg/kg BID during 48 weeks; moreover, supportive data 
in  the  adult  dose  ranging  trial,  which  examined  doses  from  0.25  mg/kg  BID  up  to  10  mg/kg  BID, 
showed similar adverse event profiles across all dose groups. 
-  about  lamivudine  efficacy,  the  half-life  for  the  active  lamivudine-TP  is  16  hours,  which  should  be 
sufficient  to  maintain  efficacious  levels,  and  this  antiretrovial  agent  is  currently  approved  for  once 
daily dosing in adults. Since changes in phosphorylation are not observed with maturation, it is likely 
that the inhomogenous BID dosing will have similar efficacy to a “homogenous” twice daily. 
▪ Risk of Choking Associated with Tablets in younger Children 
There  is  a  potential  risk  of  choking  (false  route)  associated  with  the  half  or  whole  scored  tablets  of 
Combivir in children < six years of age, although there are currently no data to indicate the likely level 
of this risk. Techniques and strategies have been developed to enable training of young children (<4 
years or <20kg) to successfully swallow solid tablets and capsules. Therefore, children anticipated to 
be at risk of choking should either be properly trained to swallow the solid form or else prescribed the 
oral solution of lamivudine and zidovudine which has been specifically formulated for this population. 
▪ Carcinogenicity in Children exposed to NRTIs 
Preclinical  studies  with  certain  NRTIs  have  revealed  some  carcinogenic  potential  in  rodents  and 
transplacental  carcinogenicity  data  are  included  in  the  EU  SPC  for  Combivir.  However  current 
information from clinical studies and widespread clinical use has not revealed any clinical concerns: 
there is some limited data from longer-term follow up of children exposed in utero and neonatally to 
AZT (zidovudine) +/- lamivudine, who were enrolled in PACTG 219/076 or in the Women and Infants 
Transmission Study (WITS). No tumours of any kind were observed in exposed children. 
The  assessment  of  the  risk  for  cancer  in  children  exposed  to  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  was 
considered not feasible to be performed within the planned MITOC study on mitochondrial toxicity in 
children exposed to NRTIs, but rather via linkage of HIV and cancer registries. 
Together to routine pharmacovigilance, additional pharmacovigilance activities are considered by the 
MAH: 
The  ongoing  paediatric  trial,  the  ARROW  Study,  which  is  an  independent  investigator  study, 
sponsored and co-ordinated by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, London. The MAH 
is providing support in the form of antiviral drug supply, including scored solid forms of Combivir. 
ARROW is a 5 year open-label randomised trial evaluating two strategic approaches for management 
of antiretroviral therapy in symptomatic HIV infected infants and children in Africa. Recruitment will 
take place over 18 months, with a maximum follow up of 5 years. 1200 children (6 months to 17 years 
old) will be enrolled from 4 sites in Africa (800 Uganda (3 sites), 400 Zimbabwe (1 site). Dosing of 
patients in ARROW is undertaken according to the weightbased dosing bands described in the WHO 
 
 
 
 
 
2006 Infant and Children Treatment Guidelines and includes the ‘inhomogeneous’ whole tab/half tab 
dosing.  Dosing  for  participants  in  ARROW  is  consistent  with  the  dosing  proposals  described  in  the 
Type II variations for scored tablets of Epivir (lamivudine) and Combivir. 
The ARROW study started recruitment in Uganda in March 2007 and in Zimbabwe in May 2007 and 
has  already  enrolled  patients  who  are  receiving  scored  tablets.  The  study  ARROW  may  provide 
information regarding over exposure, dosing regimes and choking as adverse events will be reported 
and monitored. 
Furthermore, the ARROW pharmacokinetic substudy is planned to address two distinct questions. Part 
I will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the scored tablets of Combivir, Epivir and Ziagen, including 
switch from twice to once daily dosing where appropriate. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Efavirenz (EFV) 
capsules  or  tablets  once  daily  will  also  be  measured.  Part  II  will  address  an  additional  question 
regarding the switch from liquid to solid formulations in young children in resource-limited settings. 
Upon  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  committed  to  submit  a  proactive  pharmacovigilance  survey  and  to 
submit a safety review focusing on Combivir paediatric scored tablets every 6 month. 
Risk minimisation plan 
For  important  potential  risks  and  missing  information,  routine  risk  minimisation  activities  are 
considered to be sufficient. 
For  inhomogeneous  dosing  regimen  in  children  weighing  21  to  30  kg,  the  MAH  is  considering  the 
usefulness  of  an  educational  program  to  prescribers  and  caregivers.  Planned  activities  include 
consultation with paediatric experts and Key Opinion Leaders as well as careful consideration of the 
practical needs for implementation of any program. 
A  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  for  Combivir  highlighting  the  safety  concerns  with 
lamivudine and zidovudine is presented below:

Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment 
The CHMP considers that this new formulation is needed and welcomed. Indeed, the development of a 
scored  tablet  of  Combivir  answers  a  medical  need  insofar  that  fixed  dose  combinations  are  of 
particular interest for paediatric patients due to the well known problems in  adherence to  therapy in 
this target population. This is especially critical in view of the bad taste of the oral solutions available 
for the paediatric population.  
The  development  of  a  scored  tablet  raised  two  critical  difficulties;  the  switch  of  the  zidovudine 
regimen from a three times a day to two times a day and the proposed inhomogeneous dosing regimen 
of Combivir. 
The demonstration provided by the MAH for the switch of the zidovudine posology from a three times 
a day to a two times a day regimen relies on modelling with no new clinical data. Nevertheless, it has 
to  be  recognised  that  the  twice  daily  regimen  of  zidovudine  in  paediatric  patients  is  widely  used  in 
clinical practice and the recent WHO/PENTA support has reinforced such a use, as well as national 
guidelines. 
In  view  of  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  zidovudine  Cmax  values  obtained  with  the  new 
proposed  regimen  with  scored  tablets  are  expected  to  be  higher  and  the  MAH  recognised  that  there 
was  a  concern  regarding  the  possible  increased  frequency  of  gastro-intestinal  events.  Therefore,  the 
MAH was asked to give reassurance that the higher exposure of zidovudine by intake is unlikely to 
alter the safety profile of the drug in the target paediatric population.  
In response to this concern the MAH committed to perform a proactive pharmacovigilance survey and 
to submit a safety review focusing on Combivir paediatric scored tablets every 6 month. If applicable, 
the MAH should systematically explore a regimen for diminishing these events (e.g. by either taking 3 
times  half  tablet  or  by  starting  zidovudine  therapy with  the  oral  solution  and  switching  to  the  tablet 
formulation after a few weeks). Within this variation the SPC is updated in order to warn prescribers 
for the possibly increased risk of adverse events. Furthermore, a statement on the possibility to change 
the dosing schedule in case of GI-intolerance by taking 3 half tablets of Combivir a day is inserted.  
Moreover, the ARROW study is ongoing that is expected to further substantiate the PK and safety of 
Combivir scored tablet. 
The MAH also committed to explore whether administration of crushed tablets with small amounts of 
semi-solid food or liquid is possible from a pharmaceutical quality point of view. This is proposed to 
be done within a follow-up measure to this variation. 
Finally, the MAH committed to submit a type II variation for Retrovir to harmonise the posology with 
that of Combivir (i.e. change from a TID to a BID regimen).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Overall,  given  that  this  scored  tablet  is  expected  to  simplify  the  use  of  this  fixed  combination  in 
children, this type II variation is approvable taking into consideration the changes to the SPC, labelling 
and PL and the commitments to submit the above requested follow up measures and type II variation.

Changes to the product information 
SPC 
Section 3 “Pharmaceutical form”  
Introduction of score tablets as requested by the MAH. 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  extension  of  indication  to  paediatric  patients  and  replacement  of  film 
coated tablets by scored film coated tablets as requested by the MAH.  
The approved indication is as follows: 
“Combivir  is  indicated  in  antiretroviral  combination  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (see section 4.2).” 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration”  
The  MAH  proposed  to  revise  section  4.2  to  reflect  the  different  dosing  regimen  based  on  children 
weight. This section was further updated upon CHMP request to include a statement informing that the 
dosing  regimen  for  paediatric  patients  weighing  14-30  kg  is  based  primarily  on  pharmacokinetic 
modelling  and  supported  by  data  from  clinical  studies  using  the  individual  components  lamivudine 
and zidovudine.  
Since a pharmacokinetic overexposure of zidovudine can occur a statement was introduced to request 
a  close  safety  monitoring  is  warranted  in  this  group  of  patients.  Furthermore,  if  gastrointestinal 
intolerance occurs in patients weighing 21 to 30 kg, an alternative dosing schedule with one-half tablet 
taken thrice daily can be applied in attempt to improve tolerability.  
Combivir  tablets  should  not  be  used  for  children  weighing  less  than  14  kg,  since  doses  can  not  be 
appropriately adjusted for the weight of the child. 
Section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties”  
The  MAH  proposed  to  introduce  a  sentence  on  pharmacokinetics  in  children.  This  sentence  is 
extracted from the Retrovir (zidovudine) SPC. 
Following  CHMP  comments  the  MAH  has  revised  this  section  to  be  in  line  with  the  section  4.2 
CHMP. 
The PL was updated accordingly. 
The MAH took the opportunity of this variation to split the outer carton and bottle label.

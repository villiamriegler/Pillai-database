4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1   Therapeutic indications 
Savene is indicated in adults for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation. 
4.2   Posology and method of administration 
Savene must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of anti-
cancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
Treatment should be given once daily for 3 consecutive days. The recommended dose is: 
Day 1:  1000 mg/m2 
Day 2:  1000 mg/m2 
Day 3:    500 mg/m2 
The first infusion should be initiated as soon as possible, within the first six hours after the accident. 
Treatment Day 2 and Day 3 should start at the same hour (+/- 3 hours) as Day 1. 
For patients with a body surface area of more than 2 m2 the single dose should not exceed 2000 mg. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 mL/min) the Savene 
dose should be reduced by 50% (see section 4.4 and 5.2).

Hepatic impairment 
Dexrazoxane has not been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and its use in such 
patients is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in the elderly and the use of dexrazoxane in such patients 
is not recommended. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Savene in children below the age of 18 years have not been established and 
no data are available. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use after reconstitution and dilution. 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
The indicated dose should be administered as an intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours into a large vein 
of an extremity or area other than the one affected by the extravasation. Cooling procedures such as 
ice packs should have been removed from the area at least 15 minutes before the Savene 
administration in order to allow sufficient blood flow. 
4.3   Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
• 
•  Women of childbearing potential not using contraceptive measures (see section 4.6). 
• 
• 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Concomitant vaccination with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). 
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use 
Continuous monitoring 
Local examination should be performed on a regular basis after treatment until resolution. 
If  there  is  suspicion  of  extravasation  by  vesicant  compounds  other  than  anthracyclines  through  the 
same  IV  access,  e.g.  vincristine,  mitomycin,  and  vinorelbine,  Savene  would  not be  effective  against 
the effects from these compounds. 
Since Savene will be administered to patients undergoing cytotoxic therapy with anthracyclines its 
cytotoxic potential (especially resulting in reversible haematological toxicity with a nadir occurring on 
days 11-12) will therefore add to that of the other chemotherapy administered. Haematological 
monitoring should therefore be undertaken regularly. 
Hepatic and renal-function monitoring 
Since liver dysfunction (increases in transaminases and bilirubin) may occur (especially after doses of 
above 1 000 mg/m2 dexrazoxane), it is recommended that routine liver function tests be performed 
before each administration of dexrazoxane in patients with known liver function disorders (see 
section 4.2). 
Since renal dysfunction may decrease the rate of elimination of dexrazoxane, patients with impaired 
renal function should be monitored for signs of haematological toxicity (see section 4.2 for dosing 
recommendations in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
<40 mL/min)). 
Anaphylactic reaction 
Anaphylactic reaction including angioedema, skin reactions, bronchospasm, respiratory distress, 
hypotension and loss of consciousness have been observed in patients treated with dexrazoxane and 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anthracyclines (see section 4.8). Previous history of allergy to dexrazoxane should be carefully 
considered prior to administration (see section 4.3). 
Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Since dexrazoxane possesses mutagenic activity and is used with anthracyclines known to have 
cytotoxic, mutagenic and embryotoxic properties, both sexually active men and women of 
childbearing potential should be advised not to father a child/become pregnant and must use effective 
contraceptive measures during and up to 6 months after treatment. Women must inform their doctor 
immediately if they become pregnant (see section 4.3 and 4.6). 
Potassium and sodium contents 
Savene solvent contains 98 mg potassium per 500 ml bottle. This must be taken into consideration by 
patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. Plasma potassium 
level must be closely monitored in patients at risk of hyperkalaemia. 
Savene solvent also contains 1.61 g sodium per 500 ml bottle, equivalent to 81% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use contraindicated:  
Yellow fever vaccine: Risk of fatal generalised vaccinial disease (see section 4.3). 
Concomitant use not recommended:  
• 
Other live attenuated vaccines: risk of systemic, possible fatal disease. This risk is increased in 
subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease or by concomitant 
chemotherapy. Use an inactivated vaccine where this exists (poliomyelitis). 
Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) should not be used in patients who are administered dexrazoxane to 
treat anthracycline extravasation (see section 5.3) 
Phenytoin: cytotoxic agents may reduce the absorption of phenytoin leading to an exacerbation 
of convulsions. Dexrazoxane is not recommended in combination with phenytoin. 
Concomitant use to assess carefully: 
Ciclosporin, tacrolimus: Excessive immunosuppression with risk of lymphoproliferative disease. 
Interactions common to all cytotoxics: 
• 
Due to an increased thrombotic risk in patients with malignant diseases, the use of 
anticoagulants treatment is frequent. Patients treated with anticoagulants should be monitored 
more frequently as cytotoxic agents may interact with oral anticoagulants. 
Dexrazoxane may add to the toxicity induced by the chemotherapy cycle during which the 
accident took place, requiring careful monitoring of haematological parameters (see 
section 4.4). 
Interaction specific to dexrazoxane: 
When tested in five major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4, none of these were inhibited by dexrazoxane. 
Co-administration of doxorubicin (50 to 60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (60 to 100 mg/m2) did not affect 
dexrazoxane pharmacokinetics significantly.  In studies, dexrazoxane did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin. There is limited evidence from studies that suggests epirubicin 
clearance may be increased when dexrazoxane is pre-administered, this occurred at high doses of 
epirubicin (120-135 mg/m2).  Note that in these studies dexrazoxane was administered prior to 
anthracyline administration.

4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  
Since dexrazoxane possesses mutagenic activity and is used with anthracyclines known to have 
cytotoxic, mutagenic and embryotoxic properties, both sexually active men and women of 
childbearing potential should be advised not to father a child/become pregnant and must use effective 
contraceptive measures during and up to 6 months after treatment. Women must inform their doctor 
immediately if they become pregnant (see section 4.3). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of dexrazoxane in pregnant women. Dexrazoxane may cause foetal 
harm when administered to pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Dexrazoxane should not be administered to pregnant women unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether dexrazoxane is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breast-fed infants exposed to dexrazoxane, breast-feeding is contraindicated 
during Savene therapy (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are limited fertility data from animal studies available, but testicular changes were observed in 
rats and rabbits following repeat dosing (see section 5.3). 
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Dizziness, somnolence and syncope have been reported in a few patients included in Savene studies 
TT01 and TT02 (see section 4.8). Dexrazoxane has minor influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines.  
4.8   Undesirable effects 
A number of published reports comprising more than 1000 patients have demonstrated a uniform 
pattern of dose dependent adverse reactions. Most common adverse reactions are nausea/vomiting, 
bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), injection site reactions, diarrhoea, 
stomatitis and increase in hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST). All adverse reactions have been rapidly 
reversible. 
The following information is based on two clinical studies, TT01 and TT02, of Savene administered to 
extravasation patients already receiving cycles of chemotherapeutic agents. 
The adverse reactions were those typically seen with standard chemotherapy and also with 
dexrazoxane: Nausea/vomiting in about one third of the patients, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 
about half of the patients, more rarely increased concentration of liver enzymes (ALT/AST). 
Adverse reactions observed in the two studies are listed below.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reaction via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9   Overdose 
Signs and symptoms of overdosage are likely to consist of leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, skin reactions and alopecia. Treatment should be symptomatic. 
5.  
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic agents, ATC code: V03AF02 
Two pharmacodynamic properties of dexrazoxane are described in the literature:  
1. 
2. 
Prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity, and 
Antineoplastic action 
Mechanism of action 
Dexrazoxane has two major mechanisms of action: 
1. 
Chelation of iron, especially through its ring-opened metabolite thus reducing the iron-
dependent oxidative stress causing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. 
Inhibition of topoisomerase II. 
2. 
It is not known to what extent each of these mechanisms contributes to the preventive effect on tissue 
destruction following anthracycline extravasation. 
The chelating property is probably also responsible for an increased urinary excretion of iron and zinc 
and a decreased serum concentration of calcium as described in a few studies. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical programme for Savene (dexrazoxane) included two open, single-arm, multicentre studies. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall purpose of each trial was to investigate the efficacy of intravenous Savene in preventing 
tissue damage from accidentally extravasated anthracycline, and thus preventing the patients from 
undergoing the routinely used surgical excision of the affected tissue. 
Due to the rarity of the condition only historical data could be used for comparison (demonstrating 
surgical rates of 35-50 %, in one country 100% in biopsy proven cases). 
In both studies the dosage regimen was the same. Treatment with Savene had to be started within 
6 hours from the incident and was repeated after 24 and 48 hours. The first and second doses were 
1000 mg/m2 and the third was 500 mg/m2. 
A requirement for inclusion in the efficacy part of the study was that the anthracycline extravasation 
was proven by fluorescence microscopy of one or more biopsies. 
For study purposes, patients with extravasations from a central venous access device (CVAD) were 
not included in the efficacy evaluation. 
Patients with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia > CTC grade 1 (Common Toxicity Criteria) have not 
been included in the clinical studies. 
In study TT01, 23 patients were entered and received treatment with Savene. Eighteen were evaluable 
for efficacy and safety and a further five patients were evaluable for toxicity only. None of the patients 
required surgical intervention. 
In study TT02, 57 patients entered the study and received the first dose of Savene. 36 patients were 
evaluable for efficacy. Only one of the 36 patients required surgery. 
In both studies all patients had received anthracycline. Overall, the most commonly received 
anthracycline was epirubicin (56 % of the patients). 
In both studies dexrazoxane treatment prevented the development of necrosis, allowed cancer 
treatment to continue as scheduled in the majority of patients (70.4 %), and reduced the occurrence of 
sequelae (only few and mild long-term sequelae were observed). 
5.2   Pharmacokinetic properties 
Savene must only be administered intravenously. 
Distribution 
Bibliographical data demonstrate that serum kinetics of dexrazoxane after intravenous administration 
follow an open two-compartment model independent of schedule and dose. The apparent volumes of 
distribution are 0.13-1.3 l/kg (median 0.49 l/kg). Volume of distribution is independent of dose. AUCs 
were dose-proportional. Tissue distribution is rapid, with the highest levels of unchanged parent 
compound and hydrolysed product appearing in liver and kidneys. About 2% of dexrazoxane is 
protein-bound. 
Biotransformation 
Dexrazoxane undergoes intracellular hydrolysis first to its two one-ring open intermediates (B and C) 
and then to the two-ring opened form (ADR-925) which has a structure similar to EDTA and is a 
strong chelator of iron and divalent cations as calcium ions. 
Elimination 
Dexrazoxane displays biphasic elimination kinetics. Initial elimination half lives (alpha) are 0.18-1 h 
(median 0.34 h) and terminal elimination half lives 1.9-9.1 h (median 2.8 h). Total urinary recovery of 
unchanged dexrazoxane is 34-60 %. Systemic clearance is independent of dose. The pharmacokinetics 
of the metabolites is derived from a single study with five patients. The mean elimination half-lives of 
the one-ring opened metabolite B and metabolite C are 0.9-3.9 h (n=5) and 0.5-0.8 h (n=3), 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively. The elimination half-life of the two-ring opened metabolite ADR-925 is not given in 
literature. ADR-925 is reported to increase three-fold within 15 min after infusion of 1500 mg/m2 and 
remain relatively constant on a plateau for 4 hours and then decreased to about half at 24 hours.  
In-vitro studies on dexrazoxane in human microsomes have shown high stability of dexrazoxane 
indicating that major metabolism via cytochrome P450 is unlikely. 
There is insufficient data available to draw any definite conclusions regarding intrinsic pharmaco-
kinetic factors such as age, gender, race and weight. Inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic 
variabilities have not been studied systematically. Based on a limited number of patients, inter-
individual variability calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV %) was estimated to be 
approximately 30 % for the main pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Renal impairment 
Compared with normal subjects (creatinine clearance (CLCR) >80 mL/min), exposure was 2- fold 
greater in subjects with moderate (CLCR of 30 to 50 mL/min) to severe (CLCR <30 mL/min) renal 
impairment. Modelling suggested that equivalent exposure (AUC0-inf) could be achieved if dosing were 
reduced by 50% in subjects with CLCR less than 40 mL/min compared with control subjects (CLCR 
>80 mL/min) (see section 4.2). 
Pharmacokinetics in patients with extravasations 
Clinical trial TT04 was conducted on 6 female patients undergoing treatment for anthracycline 
extravasations. The aim was to examine the pharmacokinetics of a 3-day dosing regimen of 
dexrazoxane and its efficacy in patients for anthracycline extravasation. The systemic clearances were 
similar between day 1 (9.9 L/h ± 3.1) and day 2 (11.1 L/h ± 4.5), and did not differ from those 
reported in the literature. The steady-state volume of distribution of dexrazoxane was 30.5 L ± 11.1 for 
day 1 and 35.8 L ± 19.7 for day 2. The terminal elimination half-life was consistent throughout days 
1 - 3 (2.1 - 2.2 h). The mean AUC0-24 values for day 1 and day 2 were comparable with each other, and 
the AUC0-last at day 3 was approximately half that of the first two days, suggesting that the 
pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane are dose-dependent. The overall ranges and mean of AUC0-24 
between days were very similar; it does not appear that there is any significant accumulation of 
dexrazoxane. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with dexrazoxane have shown that primary target organs were tissues that 
undergo rapid cell division: bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, testes and digestive tract. 
Myelosuppression is thus common. The apparent effects were greater during chronic than acute 
administration. The toxicity in combination with doxorubicin was additive and not synergistic. 
Dexrazoxane has been shown to possess mutagenic activity. The carcinogenic potential of 
dexrazoxane has not been investigated, however, razoxane (the racemic mixture of dexrazoxane and 
levrazoxane) has been reported to be associated with the development of malignancies in mice 
(lymphoid neoplasms) and rats (uterine carcinomas) after administration for a prolonged period of 
time. Both of these effects are expected for this class of compound. 
There are limited fertility data from animal studies available, but testicular changes were observed in 
rats and rabbits following repeat dosing. 
The related razoxane has been demonstrated to be embryotoxic in mice, rats and rabbits and 
teratogenic in rats and mice. 
When mice with experimental daunorubicin extravasation were treated with dexrazoxane systemically 
combined with topical treatment with DMSO on the daunorubicin-affected skin area, 67 % of the mice 
developed small skin wounds, whereas dexrazoxane treatment alone completely prevented the 
daunorubicin-induced skin necrosis in another group of mice.  Thus, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 
should not be used in patients who are administered dexrazoxane to treat anthracycline extravasation.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Savene is and what it is used for 
Savene contains the active substance dexrazoxane, which acts as an antidote to anti-cancer medicines 
called anthracyclines. 
Most anti-cancer medicines are administered intravenously (into a vein). Occasionally an accident 
occurs and the medicine is infused outside the vein and into the surrounding tissue or leaks from the 
vein into the surrounding tissue. This event is called extravasation. It is a serious complication as it 
can cause severe tissue damage. 
Savene is used to treat anthracyline extravasation in adults. It can reduce the amount of tissue damage 
caused by anthracycline extravasation. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Savene 
Do not use Savene: 
- 
If you are allergic to dexrazoxane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
If you are planning to become pregnant and do not use adequate contraceptive measures 
If you are breast-feeding 
If you are given yellow-fever vaccine 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Savene: 
- 
Savene should only be given to you if you have an extravasation in connection with 
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. 
During treatment with Savene the area where the extravasation has occurred will be examined 
on a regular basis and you will have blood tests taken regularly to check your blood cells. 
If you have liver problems, your doctor will monitor your liver function during treatment. 
If you have kidney problems, your doctor will monitor for signs of changes to your blood cells. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Children and adolescents 
Savene should not be administered to children below the age of 18 years. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Savene 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or may take any of the following medicines: 
- 
Vaccines: you must not use Savene if you are going to receive yellow fever vaccine and it is not 
recommended that you use Savene if you are going to receive a vaccine containing live virus 
particles. 
A product called DMSO (which is a cream to treat some skin diseases). 
Phenytoin (a treatment against seizures) (Savene may reduce the effectiveness of this medicine). 
Anticoagulants (blood thinners) (your blood may need to be monitored more frequently). 
Ciclosporin or tacrolimus (both treatments lower the body's immune system and are used to 
prevent organ rejection after an organ transplant). 
Myelosuppressive medicines (decrease production of red, white, or coagulating blood cells). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Savene should not be administered if you are pregnant.  
You must not breast-feed while you are treated with Savene. 
If you are sexually active, you are advised to use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy during 
and for six months after treatment, whether you are male or female  (see section 2 ‘Do not use 
Savene’). 
There is limited information about the effect of Savene on fertility – if you have a concern about this 
speak to you doctor. 
Driving and using machines 
Dizziness, tiredness and sudden fainting have been reported in a few patients treated with Savene. The 
treatment is considered to have a limited influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Savene contains potassium and sodium 
The Savene solvent contains 98 mg potassium in each 500 ml bottle which may be harmful to people 
on a low-potassium diet or who have kidney problems. If you are at risk of high potassium levels in 
your blood, your doctor will monitor this. 
Savene solvent also contains 1.61 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 500 ml 
bottle.  This is equivalent to 81% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. 
3. 
How to use Savene 
Savene will be given to you under the control of a doctor experienced in the use of anti-cancer 
treatments. 
Recommended dose 
The dose will depend on your height, weight and kidney function. Your doctor will calculate your 
body surface area in square meter (m2) to determine the dose you should receive. The recommended 
adult dose (with normal kidney function) is: 
Day 1:  1000 mg/m2  
Day 2:  1000 mg/m2 
Day 3:    500 mg/m2 
Your doctor may reduce your dose if you have kidney problems. 
Savene will be given by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last 1-2 hours. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Frequency of administration 
You will receive your infusion once daily for 3 consecutive days. The first infusion will be given as 
soon as possible and within the first six hours after extravasation of an anthracycline medicine. Savene 
infusion will be given at the same time every day of your treatment. 
Savene will not be used again at the time of your next anthracycline cycle, except if extravasation 
occurs again. 
If you receive more Savene than you should 
If you receive more Savene than you should, you will be closely monitored with specific attention to 
your blood cells, potential gastro-intestinal signs, skin reactions and hair loss.  
If Savene comes into contact with the skin, the affected area should immediately be rinsed thoroughly 
with water. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

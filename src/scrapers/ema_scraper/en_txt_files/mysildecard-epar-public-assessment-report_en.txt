2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
The  proposed  product  is  an  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets  containing  Sildenafil  citrate  as  active 
substance.  Sildenafil  citrate  is  a  chemical  substance  and  the  dosage  form  has  been  developed  as  generic 
product  to  the  centrally  authorised  product  Revatio  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  containing  the  same  active 
substance in the same pharmaceutical form. 
Sildenafil  is  a  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP)  specific 
phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE5),  the  enzyme  that  is  responsible  for  degradation  of  cGMP.  Apart  from  the 
presence  of  this  enzyme  in  the  corpus  cavernosum  of  the  penis,  PDE5  is  also  present  in  the  pulmonary 
vasculature. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in 
relaxation.  In  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  this  can  lead  to  vasodilation  of  the  pulmonary 
vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation.  
Sildenafil is approved in the EU for the treatment: 
Adults 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, 
to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary 
hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/533666/2016 
Page 5/24 
 
  
  
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Efficacy in 
terms  of  improvement  of  exercise  capacity  or  pulmonary  haemodynamics  has  been  shown  in  primary 
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. 
Proposed posology and method of administration 
Adults 
The recommended dose is 20 mg three times a day (TID). 
Paediatric population (1 year to 17 years) 
For paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old, the recommended dose in patients ≤ 20 kg is 10 mg (1 
ml  of  compounded  suspension)  three  times  a  day  and  for  patients  >  20  kg  is  20  mg  (2  ml of  compounded 
suspension or 1 tablet) three times a day. 
Patients using other medicinal products 
In  general,  any  dose  adjustment  should  be  administered  only  after  a  careful  benefit-risk  assessment.  A 
downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered when sildenafil is co-administered to 
patients already receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin or saquinavir. A downward dose adjustment to 
20  mg  once  daily  is  recommended  in  case  of  co-administration  with  more  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors 
clarithromycin,  telithromycin  and  nefazodone.  Dose  adjustments  for  sildenafil  may  be  required  when  co-
administered with CYP3A4 inducers. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
Dose  adjustments  are  not  required  in  elderly  patients.  Clinical  efficacy  as  measured  by  6-minute  walk 
distance could be less in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment  
Initial  dose  adjustments  are  not  required  in  patients  with  renal  impairment,  including  severe  renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). A downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be 
considered after a careful benefit-risk assessment only if therapy is not well-tolerated. 
Hepatic impairment 
Initial dose adjustments are not required in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class  A and  B). A 
downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered after a careful benefit-risk assessment 
only if therapy is not well-tolerated. 
Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Paediatric population 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  sildenafil  in  children  below  1  year  of  age  has  not  been  established.  No  data  are 
available.

Method of administration 
Mysildecard  is  for  oral  use  only.  Tablets  should  be  taken  approximately  6  to  8  hours  apart  with  or  without 
food. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  was  submitted  under  Article  3(3)  of  Regulation  EC  726/2004 
“Generic  of  a  Centrally  Authorised  Medicinal  Product”  and  article  10(1)  Generic  Application  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended.  
The reference medicinal product is Revatio 20mg tablets by the company Pfizer, originally authorised in the 
community on 28.10.2005 (marketing authorisation numbers EU/1/05/318/001 and EU/05/318/004) 
Bioequivalence  with  the  product  Viagra  100mg  (sildenafil  citrate)  tablets  by  the  company  Pfizer  is  claimed, 
the applicant has requested a biowaiver for the 20mg tablets presentation of sildenafil citrate. 
The CHMP Guidelines were followed. The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the 
clinical investigation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 20 mg of sildenafil as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose (PH 102), calcium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, croscarmellose 
sodium, and magnesium stearate. 
Film coat: hypromellose 6 mPas, titanium dioxide (E171), and triacetin 
The product is available in PVC-Al blister packs as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of active substance is 5-[2-Ethoxy-5-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)sulfonyl]phenyl]-1-methyl-
3-propyl-1,6-dihydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one dihydrogen 2-hydroxypropane- 1,2,3 -
tricarboxylate corresponding to the molecular formula C28H38N6O11S and has a relative molecular mass 
666.7 and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/533666/2016 
Page 7/24 
 
 
 
  
  
The active substance is a white or almost white, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder, slightly soluble in 
water and in methanol and practically insoluble in hexane. The solubility is pH dependent. 
Sildenafil has neither asymmetric nor chiral carbon atom, hence it does not exhibit optical isomerism. 
Sildenafil citrate is known to exist in different salts and their polymorphic forms like anhydrous and 
hemihydrate. The polymorphism of sildenafil citrate is checked by XRD and DSC. Three consecutive batches 
of sildenafil citrate were analysed by XRD. The obtained spectra were compared with that of sildenafil citrate 
literature and are matching with anhydrous form. In addition to this, stability batches at 38th month interval 
were also analysed by XRD for further confirmation of polymorphic stability. Based on the data, the active 
substance manufacturer consistently produces anhydrous form. 
As there is a monograph of sildenafil in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for sildenafil 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The  control  tests  were  carried  out  to  comply  with  the  specifications  and  test  methods  of  the  Ph.  Eur. 
monograph. Additional specifications have been set for particle size, impurities (piperazine dimer and sum of 
4-nitrocarboxylic  acid  and  4-nitrocarboxamide)  and  nickel  content.  All  additional  methods  have  been 
adequately described and validated according to ICH Q2.  
Stability 
The re-test period of the substance granted by the CEP is 5 years when stored in a double polyethylene bags 
(outer black) placed in a polyethylene drum. 
2.2.3.   Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film-coated tablets is a white, film-coated, round, biconvex tablet debossed with M 
on one side of the tablet and SL over 20 on the other. 
Assessment report

The development strategy was to design and develop a stable and bioequivalent generic product of Sildenafil 
Citrate film-coated tablets using commonly used excipients and similar to the reference product. 
The following attributes of the active substance were considered during the development of the finished 
product: appearance, solubility, potential isomerism, flow properties, particle size, polymorphism, and active 
substance-excipient study. The active substance does not exhibit optical isomerism, has poor flow properties 
and the data shows that no significant impact of particle size is observed on the drug release profile (more 
than 85% is released within 15 minutes). Active substance-Excipient compatibility study confirms no 
significant change in the physical appearance and in impurity levels of the binary mixtures. 
All the excipients are conventional pharmaceutical ingredients complying with the requirements of European 
Pharmacopoeia except of film coating agent that is tested according to in house standards. The colorants 
used in coating material comply with EC regulation 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report. 
The formulation of Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film coated tablets was developed based on the literature search 
and characterization of reference product i.e. Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablets. Development started with 
Sildenafil Citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets and the same formula was scaled down to lower strengths (i.e. 
20mg). Selection of excipients was based on literature search, past experience with film-coated tablet dosage 
form, drug-excipient compatibility study and the qualitative formula of reference product. To optimize the 
quantity of disintegrant (croscarmellose sodium), the trials were performed without and with different 
quantities of croscarmellose sodium i.e. (0 – 4 %). The formula without disintegrant show increased 
disintegration and a decrease of drug release therefore a 3% of croscarmellose sodium was chosen in the 
commercial finished product.  
To optimize the quantity of water used as granulation agent, trials with different quantity of water were 
performed. Different quantities of water have no effect on the tablet characteristics and dissolution profile. To 
optimize the quantity of lubricant (Magnesium stearate), the trials with different quantities of magnesium 
stearate i.e. (0,5 – 2 %) were performed. The results show no difference in the tablet parameters and 
dissolution profile. Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film coated tablets were developed as dose proportional formula 
to the 100 mg film coated tablets. 
A bioequivalence study comparing the 100 mg strength of test product and reference product was carried out 
as an open label, randomized, two treatment, two period, two sequence, single dose cross-over study 
comparing the test product Sildenafil Citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets (with the reference product Viagra 
(Sildenafil) 100 mg film-coated tablets in healthy, adult male subjects under fasting conditions. The 
dissolution profiles of the tested product and the reference product have been compared in three medias 
(0.01N HCl, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer, pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer). More than 85% of the active substance was 
released within 15 minutes in tested and reference product at 0.01N HCl and at pH 4.5 Acetate buffer. The 
amount of drug released from both (tested and reference) products was found incomplete (51 – 57 %) after 
45 min at pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been 
demonstrated. The test product against European reference product has been proven to be bioequivalent. 
A bio waiver justification was provided for the use of Sildenafil 100 mg film coated tablets in the 
bioequivalence study instead of 20 mg strength. The conditions for waiver according to the Guideline 
CPMP/EWP/ QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1 were fulfilled. The test product i.e. Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film-coated 
tablets against Sildenafil Citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets (used in bioequivalence study) are exhibiting 
Assessment report  
EMA/533666/2016 
Page 9/24 
 
 
  
  
similar dissolution profiles with 85 % of drug release in 15 minutes in both 0.01N Hydrochloric acid and pH 
4.5 Acetate buffer. The dissolution profile between the test product i.e. Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film coated 
tablets against Sildenafil Citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets (used in the bioequivalence study) was found to 
be similar in pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer. Since all the requirements to waive bioequivalence studies as 
mentioned in CPMP guideline on the Investigation of Bio-equivalence – CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev 01 are 
fulfilled, the bioequivalence study results of Sildenafil Citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets can be extended to 
Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film-coated tablets. 
As the active substance have very poor flow properties, a wet granulation manufacturing process was 
developed. The active substance is BCS class II drug having low solubility hence wet granulation approach 
was considered to improve its wettability. The manufacturing process was optimized at following stages: dry 
mixing, blending time, hardness (resistance to crushing) challenge studies, machine speed trails. 
The primary packaging is PVC-Al blister packs. The material complies with Ph Eur and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  11  main  steps:  verification  of  dispensed  raw  material,  sifting  of 
intragranular  materials,  granulation,  drying,  dry  screening,  sifting  of  extragranular  materials,  blending, 
compression, coating, inspection, and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  (preparation  of  lubricated  blend,  compression,  coating  and 
packaging)  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing 
process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification  (UPLC,  UV,  titanium  dioxide,  for  citrate  ion),  dissolution  (UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph 
Eur), assay (UPLC), loss on drying (Ph Eur), microbiological test (Ph Eur), related substances (UPLC). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 36 months at 
25  ºC  /  60%  RH,  under  intermediate  conditions  for  12  months  at  30 °C  /  75%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months 
Assessment report  
EMA/533666/2016 
Page 10/24 
 
  
  
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches 
are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  loss  on  drying,  related  compounds,  dissolution,  assay  and 
microbiological test. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. 
The  stability  data  presented  indicated  that  the  product  complies  with  proposed  finished  product  shelf  life 
specification and no significant changes have been observed. The photostability study results infer that there 
is  no  significant  difference  observed  charged  at  different  study  conditions,  namely  direct  exposure  and 
protected samples (dark control samples) when compared to initial results. Thus, it can be concluded that the 
finished product is photostable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
Assessment report  
EMA/533666/2016 
Page 11/24 
 
 
 
 
  
  
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Mysildecard is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
sildenafil-  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to  the  active  substance.  Thus,  the 
Environmental Risk Assessment is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Mysildecard is approvable from the non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for tablets containing sildenafil. To support the marketing authorisation application the 
applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was 
the pivotal study for the assessment. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. A QA statement has been 
also provided.  
The applicant has also provided a list of GCP inspections at the clinical and analytical sites. 
Exemption  
The applicant has requested a biowaiver for the 20mg presentation with the justification provided below: 
According  to  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1  –  August 
2010), Sildenafil Citrate 20 mg film-coated tablets satisfy the conditions for waiver of bioequivalence studies 
conducted on Sildenafil Citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets as discussed below:

Population(s) studied 
Forty four (44) healthy adult male subjects were enrolled in the study. All subjects were between 18 and 55 
years  of  age  (both  included),  with  a  BMI  between  18.5  and  24.9,  normal  laboratory  test  results  and  vital 
signs. All subjects signed an informed consent prior to the study initiation. 
Thirty nine subjects completed all periods of the study as per protocol, and plasma samples from 39 subjects 
were used for PK evaluation. In addition, plasma from subject 24 was analysed for safety. Subjects number 
10, 17, 24, 25 and 42 were withdrawn from the study.  
Reasons for withdrawal were following: 
•

Subject No.10 was tested positive for drugs in urine prior to period II. 
Subject No. 17 was tested positive for drugs in urine prior to period II. 
Subject No. 24 experienced adverse event. 
Subject No. 25 was tested positive for drugs in urine prior to period II. 
Subject No. 42 withdrew consent prior to period I. 
Analytical methods 
Sildenafil  and  its  metabolite  N-desmethyl-sildenafil  were  determined  by  HPLC  method  using  tandem  mass 
spectrometry detection (Analytical Method Procedure No. SAP-010-00). The interface used with the API 2000 
LC/MS/MS  was  a  Turbo  IonSpray.  The  positive  ions  were  measured  in  MRM  mode.  Analytes  and  internal 
standard (sildenafil-d3) were extracted from K 3EDTA plasma by solid phase extraction technique. 
The  active  metabolite  (piperazine  N-desmethylsildenafil  reported  here  as  N-desmethylsildenafil)  data  were 
submitted as supportive therapeutic outcome. 
The  study  samples  were  measured  using  the  same  instrumentation  as  in  validation  phase  (an  API  2000 
LC/MS/MS  system  equipped  with  a  pumps  Shimadzu  LC-20ADvp,  an  autosampler  Shimadzu  SIL-HTc), 
analytical column Betasil C18 (50x3.0mm, 3µm).  
Calibration curves ranged from 9.640 to 1447.340 ng/mL and from 4.060 to 811.200 ng/mL for sildenafil and 
N-desmethyl-sildenafil,  respectively.  Quantitation  was  based  on  peak  area  ratio  of  sildenafil  versus  internal 
standard.  A  least  squares  linear  regression  with  weighing  factor  1/x2  was  used.  All  data  were  generated  by 
Applied Biosystems Analyst® Software 1.4.2. 
The  calibration  curve  standards  and  the  QC  samples  were  prepared  with  stock  solutions  from  separate 
weighing. The working standard & QC solutions were stored in the refrigerator at 2–8°C.

Certificates of analysis for sildenafil citrate (Batch No. SDC/0709002, Retest Date August 2009), desmethyl-
sildenafil  (Batch  No.  RAM-38-4554,  Expiry  Date  April  2010)  and  sildenafil-D3  (Batch  No.  SD-5796,  Expiry 
Date August 2010) were attached to the Bioanalytical report. 
There  was  one  protocol  deviation  in  plasma  samples  storage  conditions  during  clinical  period  of  the  study 
which may not have significant impact on the study outcome. 
Incurred sample reanalysis was not performed. The study had been carried out before the requirement of ISR 
was introduced into the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation in February 2012. Scientific justification 
should be provided to evaluate the performance of the method. 
Bioanalytical method validation 
The validation results of a high performance liquid chromatographic method using tandem mass spectrometry 
detection  for  determination  of  sildenafil  and  N-desmethyl-sildenafil  in  human  plasma  (Analytical  Method 
Procedure  No.  SAP-010-00)  are  presented  in  the  Validation  Report  No.:  VR-010-00.  The  method  was 
validated in CRC Matrix Laboratories Ltd. in 2009. The long term stability data of sildenafil and N-desmethyl-
sildenafil  in  solutions  and  in  human  plasma  were  submitted  in  Addenda  01-00  and  02-00  to  the  validation 
report.  
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The  PK  parameters  for  sildenafil  and  piperazine  N-desmethyl  sildenafil  were  calculated  by  using  non-
compartmental model by WinNonlin Professional Software (version 5.0) with the data from 39 subjects. 
From  the  time/concentration  values,  various  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (Cmax,  Tmax,  AUC0-t,  Kel,  AUC0-∞, 
AUC0-t/AUC0-∞  and  t 1/2)  were  calculated  and  these  were  used  in  the  statistical  analysis  to  compare  the 
bioequivalence of the test and reference products. The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, 
were estimated to evaluate bioequivalence of Sildenafil. 
Statistical methods  
Blinding 
This study comprised of a randomized, open label design. Being a bioequivalence study an open label design 
was  selected,  however  analysts  were  blinded  to  the  sequence  of  administration  of  test  and  reference 
formulations. 
Randomization 
The order of receiving the Test and Reference product for each subject during each period of the study was 
determined according to the randomization schedule. The dosing (treatment) of Test and Reference product 
was divided into two sequences (RT or TR).  
Determination of sample size 
Sample  size  was  based  on  estimates  obtained  from  reported  literature  and  previous  studies.  Assuming  a 
formulation ratio (T/R) ranging from 0.95 - 1.05 and with the maximum observable intra-subject variability 
of  30%,  a  sample-size  of  42  subjects  would  be  sufficient  to  prove  bioequivalence  between  the  two 
formulations  with  a  power  of  at  least  80%  considering  the  drop-outs  and  withdrawals  44  subjects  were 
considered.

Safety data 
There  were  no  deaths  or serious  adverse events  observed  during  the  study.  Two  subjects  reported  adverse 
events,  which  were  not  considered  serious  and  did  not  require  hospitalisation.  Subject  No.  24  experienced 
high-grade fever associated with chills and rigors after administration of the test product. No other associated 
complaints were reported. The subject was administered paracetamol 500 mg one tablet three times daily for 
four  days.  Relation  to  the  investigational  medicinal  products  was  evaluated  as  unlikely.  Subject  No.  30 
experienced a single episode of vomiting after administration of the reference medicinal product, without any 
other associated complaints. The relation to investigational medicinal product was evaluated as possible.  
Individual  laboratory  values  of  the  subjects  at  the  time  of  post-study  laboratory  assessment  were  also 
reviewed.  The  laboratory test  for  those  investigations,  which  were  found  to  be  abnormal  were  repeated  on 
the follow-up. All out-of-range parameters were evaluated for their clinical significance, or were followed until 
they became normal.  
None of the subjects showed clinically significant abnormalities, but several had their laboratory parameters 
out of range. This is however not considered of concern.  
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Mysildecard is considered bioequivalent with Revatio. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support the application, a literature review of the preclinical and clinical data for the active substance has 
been submitted, together with the results of a bioequivalence study conducted with the 100 mg presentation. 
In this application, an essential similarity is claimed to the original product Revatio 20 mg, but the study has 
been  conducted  with  the  reference  medicinal  product  Viagra  100  mg.  Based  on  the  fact  that  Revatio  and 
Viagra  have  the  same  qualitative  composition,  proportional  quantitative  composition,  and  are  manufactured 
by  the  same  manufacturing  process,  extrapolation  of  the  bioequivalence  findings  to  another  originator 
product is considered justified. Submitted bioequivalence study was randomized, crossover, single-dose study 
conducted under fasted conditions. The study has been declared to be conducted in GCP setting, and list of 
GCP inspections of the clinical, analytical and statistical sites have been submitted.  
Bioanalytical  method  was  of  satisfactory  performance,  and  adequately  validated.  Apart  from  sildenafil  PK 
parameters,  the  applicant  has  also  submitted  values  for  the  active  metabolite  piperazine  N-desmethyl 
sildenafil  as  supportive  data.  Statistical  evaluation  of  the  obtained  data  demonstrated  bioequivalence 
between  test  and  reference  product  for  sildenafil.  Regarding  the  N-desmethyl  metabolite,  no  formal 
bioequivalence  analysis  has  been  explored.  Considering  that  bioequivalence  has  been  demonstrated  for  the 
parent drug, further analysis of the metabolite is not considered necessary. 
Furthermore,  the  applicant  has  requested  biowaiver  for  the  20mg  presentation.  To  support  the  request,  a 
justification  and  results  of  comparative  dissolution  tests  have  been  provided.  Sildenafil  exhibits  linear 
pharmacokinetics up to 200 mg after single dose administration, and after repeated administration linearity 
has  been  demonstrated  until  80  mg.  Furthermore,  proportionality  in  the  composition  between  20mg  and 
100mg  strength  has  been  shown.  The  dissolution  profiles  of  the  test  and  reference  product  has  been  fully 
addressed,  and  no  more  data  are  needed.  Details  of  the  dissolution  profile  assessment  can  be  found  in  the 
quality  assessment  report.  Provided  that  the  applicant  adequately  addresses  the  abovementioned  issue, 
biowaiver could be granted for sildenafil 20 mg. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Mysildecard was provided and was accepted by the 
CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered 
necessary. 
Results  of  the  study  09-VIN-034  suggest  bioequivalence  between  the  Mysildecard  and  Viagra  100  mg. 
Biowaiver criteria are considered fulfilled and biowaiver can be granted for 20mg strength. 
In conclusion, Mysildecard is approvable from the clinical point of view.

2.8.  Product information 
The latest approved PI of the reference product is being implemented (Revatio procedure EMEA/H/C/ 00638/ 
II73). 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of sildenafil citrate tablets. The reference product Revatio is 
indicated for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this 
application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was 
presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data 
on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; 
the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was 
considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a cross over randomised study. The study design was 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective 
European requirements. The study design, (fasting status, choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling 
time as well as wash-out period) was adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of sildenafil citrate met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared 
with Viagra. Viagra contains the same active substance as Revatio but is indicated for another indication 
(male erectile dysfunction). The bioequivalence study was performed with Viagra, which is considered 
acceptable as it contains the same active substance as Revatio. The point estimates and their 90% 
confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-
defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Mysildecard is favourable in the following indication: 
Adults 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, 
to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary 
hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Efficacy in

terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown in primary 
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease (see section 
5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

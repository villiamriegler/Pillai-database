COMP opinion (adoption via written 
21 September 2020 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing obiltoxaximab was 
considered justified based on non-clinical data showing increased survival with the proposed 
product in valid models of the condition; 
the condition is life-threatening due to development of pleural effusions, haemorrhagic 
mediastinitis and haemorrhagic meningitis, linked to a fatality rate of 45% up to 100%; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.01 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in 
the European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the 
medicinal product containing obiltoxaximab will be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided non-clinical data showing improved survival when the product 
was used in addition to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, currently authorized for the treatment of the 
condition. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the 
patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, that may be infecting man via 
cutaneous (the most common naturally occurring form), pulmonary or gastrointestinal routes. Anthrax 
commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep and goats, but humans can also be infected.  
The main risk factor for getting anthrax is some type of contact with contaminated animal hides, hair, 
bone products, and wool. Inhalation anthrax was most commonly contracted when workers breathed in 
airborne anthrax spores, which can be released during industrial processes such as tanning hides and 
processing wool. 
Breathing in spores means a person has been exposed to the disease, but it doesn't mean they'll get 
symptoms. The bacteria spores must "germinate," before the actual disease occurs.  Once the spores 
germinate, they release several toxic substances, which cause internal bleeding, swelling, and tissue 
death. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000037218 
Page 4/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Person to person transmission of inhalational disease does not occur. The incubation period for 
inhalation anthrax ranges from 1 to 60 days and patients have frequently complained over fever, chills, 
drenching sweats, profound fatigue, minimally productive cough, nausea or vomiting, and chest 
discomfort. Cutaneous anthrax would not be expected to be a major problem in case of deliberate 
release of anthrax spores, although it is not impossible that this might occur.  
The approved therapeutic indication is:  
“Obiltoxaximab SFL is indicated in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs in all age groups 
for treatment of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. 
Obiltoxaximab SFL is indicated in all age groups for post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax 
when alternative therapies are not appropriate or are not available.” 
The proposed therapeutic indication falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition 
“Treatment of anthrax”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Please see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The life-threatening nature of inhalational anthrax disease remains unchanged since the submission of 
the ODD application on 18 May 2018; and no new therapies for inhalational anthrax have been 
approved in the EU in the meantime. 
Inhalational anthrax, the most severe form of anthrax, has a fatality rate of approximately 50% even 
when managed with the best treatment options currently available and under circumstances of 
heightened awareness (Jernigan et al., 2002). Patients who are not appropriately diagnosed and 
treated during the prodromal phase of localised infection and progress to the fulminant stage of 
inhalational anthrax have a mortality rate of 97%, regardless of the treatment they receive (Holty et 
al., 2006). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor performed a PubMed literature search to retrieve published articles on the epidemiology of 
anthrax. A total of 25 publications were identified, two of which represented case reports of 
inhalational anthrax occurring over the past approximately 50 years (Enticknap, Galbraith et al. 1968, 
Anaraki, Addiman et al. 2008).  
Anthrax is subject to surveillance in the EU, with the ECDC as the repository of data collected across 
Europe. According to ECDC, total 58 confirmed cases of anthrax have been reported in the EU/EEA 
between 2010 and 2015, ranging from 1 to 31 confirmed cases per year (ECDC 2017). According to 
the sponsor, a limitation of the ECDC data is that there is no indication of the type of anthrax and 
many cases are assumed to be of cutaneous anthrax, which is usually more easily self-limiting than 
inhalation forms. In any case the prevalence (in fact incidence) of anthrax in the EU is very low, and 
can be approximated to 0.001 in 10,000.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The main approach for treatment of suspected or confirmed clinical cases of inhalational anthrax, as 
well as for post-exposure prophylaxis is antibiotic therapy, usually with fluoroquinolones.  
There are no studies in humans but data from guinea pigs and monkeys have indicated that 
doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are both efficacious in prophylaxis and in curative treatment (1). 
However, early treatment is essential. Because of the mortality associated with inhalational anthrax, 
two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective are recommended; however, controlled 
studies to support a multiple drug approach are not available. Ciprofloxacin is the recommended first 
line treatment. Other quinolones such as Ofloxacin and Levofloxacin offer alternative treatment options 
but dose recommendations can presently only be given in adults. Doxycycline and penicillins are 
alternative therapies when susceptibility has been confirmed although penicillin is not bactericidal 
against Bacillus anthracis. Oral amoxicillin is also an option for late-stage therapy if the patient is 
improving and susceptibility has been confirmed.  In this regard, preliminary data indicate that B. 
anthracis may produce penicillin-hydrolysing enzymes 
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5042a1.htm). 
Ciprofloxacin is licensed for the treatment of inhalation anthrax. In spite of prolonged combination 
antibiotic treatment with effective drugs the mortality rate of inhalation anthrax remains unacceptably 
high and there is certainly room for new therapeutic approaches to improve the prognosis of patients 
who have been exposed to anthrax spores. 
Ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and penicillins are authorised for the condition in the Community. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor supported the significant benefit with a battery on non-clinical studies, namely in rabbits 
and monkeys, the two most widely used species for anthrax development studies. Some of the studies 
investigated the pharmacological effects of obiltoxaximab and some pharmacodynamics parameters 
such as the anti-PA antibody response, while a number of other studies were proof of concept studies 
using obiltoxaximab as monotherapy or in combination (table 1) after bacterial challenge and 
established disease.

The sponsor also tested the product in post-exposure prophylaxis, showing similar efficacy as in the 
treatment setting. Post-exposure prophylaxis is considered by the COMP as part of treatment and it is 
therefore covered by this application. 
The significant benefit is adequately supported by the non-clinical studies in rabbits and monkeys 
performed by the sponsor, which show better efficacy of obiltoxaximab as single therapy compared to 
fluoroquinolones, and additionally increased efficacy when used in combination with fluoroquinolones.

4.  COMP position adopted on 21 September 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of anthrax (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain 
below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 0.001 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening due to development of pleural effusions, haemorrhagic 
mediastinitis and haemorrhagic meningitis, linked to a fatality rate of 45% and up to 100%; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Obiltoxaximab SFL may be of potential significant benefit to 
those affected by the orphan condition is confirmed. Since clinical trials exposing humans to 
anthrax spores would neither be ethical nor feasible, the sponsor provided non-clinical data in 
established models of inhalational anthrax showing improved survival when the product was used 
in addition to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, which are still currently authorized for the treatment 
of the condition. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for 
the patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Obiltoxaximab SFL, 
obiltoxaximab for treatment of anthrax (EU/3/18/2065) is not removed from the Community Register 
of Orphan Medicinal Products.

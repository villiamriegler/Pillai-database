Introduction 
Topotecan was authorised in the European Union (EU) through the centralised procedure in 1996 and 
is also registered in 59 other countries around the world for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer 
following platinum-based therapy.  In addition, topotecan is registered in the EU and 39 other 
countries around the world for the treatment of relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 
Approximately 230,000 patients have been treated with topotecan (this represents approximately 
1,000,000 courses of therapy) since its first market launch in May 1996. 
This is an application to add an additional clinical indication, treatment in combination with cisplatin 
of patients with carcinoma of the cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IV-B 
disease, thereby varying the existing marketing authorisation for topotecan hydrochloride. 
Topotecan is a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent, semisynthetic analogue of the alkaloid camptothecin. 
Topotecan is exerting its activity by the inhibition of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I that is 
involved in DNA replication. The inhibition is due to stabilisation of the intermediate covalent 
complex of enzyme and strand-cleaved DNA. As a result, DNA damage induces apoptotic cell death 
predominantly in replicating cells such as tumour cells.  
Cervical cancer remains the second most common cancer in women worldwide and in many countries, 
the leading cause of cancer related deaths among women. Globally, approximately 493,000 women are 
diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer each year and each year approximately 273,000 will die as a 
direct consequence of the disease. The incidence rates around the world vary considerably with an 
estimated 80% of new cases occurring in less developed countries.   
In countries with efficient screening for cervical cancer, advanced disease is relatively rare, but overall 
there are about 38,000 new cases of cervical cancer a year within the EU and about 17,000 associated 
deaths. Vaccination is expected to further reduce the incidence of the disease.  
Approximately 90% of cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. In the EU, most patients are 
diagnosed with early disease (FIGO I-IIa) and surgery is curative. In more advanced, non-metastatic 
disease, radio- and radiochemotherapy is administered with curative intent. In case of persistent, 
recurrent or metastatic disease, treatment is in most cases administered with palliative intent.  
There is no universally accepted standard chemotherapy for advanced and incurable disease, but 
cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every three weeks may be regarded as a reasonable reference regimen for 
comparative trials. 
New indication: Treatment, in combination with cisplatin, of patients with carcinoma of the cervix 
recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IV-B disease. Patients with prior exposure to 
cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see 
section 5.1 of the SPC).  
New posology: The recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as a 30-minute 
intravenous infusion daily on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on 
day 1 at a dose of 50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated 
every 21 days for 6 courses or until progressive disease. 
In addition, new information on the pharmacokinetics of topotecan in combination with cisplatin has 
been included in sections 4.5 and 5.2.

Clinical aspects 
Clinical Pharmacology 
The dose and schedule of topotecan in combination with cisplatin for cervical cancer has been 
determined on the basis of safety and tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of 0.75 mg/m2/day of 
topotecan as a 3-day regimen in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 in patients with 
cervical cancer has not been investigated. However, a previous study in ovarian cancer patients 
investigated the pharmacokinetics of 0.75 mg/m2/day topotecan in a 5-day regimen in combination 
with cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1. This study was submitted in support of the current variation together 
with a study investigating the pharmacokinetics of a topotecan + cisplatin + paclitaxel regimen in 
patients with ovarian carcinoma.  
Study 096 
The objective of the study was to determine the effect of a single IV infusion of cisplatin on the 
pharmacokinetics of intravenous topotecan. Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 was given as an infusion on Day 1 
only. Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/day was given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 consecutive days. The first 
dose of topotecan was given directly after cisplatin. Blood sampling for topotecan lactone and total 
topotecan concentrations were drawn on Days 1 and 5 and for cisplatin concentrations on Day 1.  
Compared to Day 1, mean systemic exposure of topotecan lactone (Cmax and AUC) on Day 5 was 
increased by approximately 29% and 16%, respectively, and mean exposure of total topotecan was 
increased by 23% and 12%, respectively. One subject had unusually high Cmax values for both total 
topotecan and topotecan lactone. Removal of this subject reduced the mean increase in Cmax values to 
16% and 11%, respectively. The mean terminal elimination half life increased on Day 5 compared to 
Day 1 from 1.96 h to 2.46 h for topotecan lactone and 2.02 h to 2.20 h for total topotecan. Mean CL 
and Vss values of total topotecan were slightly reduced on Day 5 compared to Day 1 (19.1 L/h/m2 
versus 21.3 L/h/m2 and 54.5 L/m2 versus 59.0 L/m2, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for 
topotecan lactone (35.6 L/h/m2 versus 40.8 L/h/m2 (CL) and 103 L/m2 versus 107 L/m2 (Vss)). The 
mean maximum plasma concentration of free platinum following intravenous infusion of cisplatin was 
similar to other reported values.  
Study 100 
This was a phase I study, designed to determine the maximum tolerated doses of paclitaxel, cisplatin, 
and topotecan administered intravenously every 21 days as first-line therapy in patients with advanced 
ovarian cancer.  Paclitaxel (110 mg/m2) was administered as a 24 h IV infusion on Day 1, followed by 
cisplatin (50 mg/m2) as a 3-h infusion on Day 2, followed by topotecan (0.3 mg/m2) as a 30-minute 
infusion daily on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  The pharmacokinetic determinations were made during course 1; 
paclitaxel samples were obtained on Day 1, and cisplatin and topotecan (total and lactone) samples on 
Day 2.  One additional daily sample (2.5 h after the start of the infusion) was obtained on Days 3-6 for 
topotecan (total and lactone).   
Mean topotecan lactone and total topotecan CL and Vss values were 47.5 L/h/m2 and 19.3 L/h/m2, 
respectively and 84.9 L/m2 and 49.5 L/m2, respectively.  These values were similar to those observed 
in Study 096.  Mean concentrations 2.5 h after start of infusion were slightly higher 22% (topotecan 
lactone) and 19% (total topotecan) on Days 3-6 compared to Day 2.  Mean percent topotecan dose 
excreted in urine was calculated in this study; mean values were lower on Days 3 (43%), 4 (45%), and 
5 (45%) than Day 2 (50%).  CV% ranged between 41 and 50 (mean 45) across days.   
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and cisplatin were similar to previously reported values, although 
the half-life of cisplatin was somewhat longer than previously reported.  
Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
As previous data has not indicated a change in topotecan pharmacokinetics over time at repeated 
administration over 5 days, the results of studies 096 and 100 might suggest that cisplatin decreases 
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the (renal) clearance of topotecan. However, firm conclusions cannot be drawn, as there was no 
comparison of topotecan concentrations with and without cisplatin on day 1. Topotecan is 
predominantly cleared renally, and there is some limited biliary excretion. Topotecan undergoes very 
little metabolism, although a demethylated metabolite has been identified in plasma, urine and faeces 
in humans. A possible explanation might be a hydration prior to cisplatin infusion and cisplatin-
induced (transient) reduction in kidney function. Appropriate information in this regard has been 
added to sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SPC.    
Topotecan as monotherapy in ovarian cancer is dosed at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/m2 per day for 5 
consecutive days every 3 weeks. The dosing recommendations for patients with compromised renal or 
liver function as described in the current SPC are considered appropriate also for the regimen 
recommended for cervical cancer. The Hycamtin SPC makes reference to the product information of 
cisplatin regarding e.g. special population recommendations for cisplatin, which is appropriate.

Supportive Phase II study - GSK-CRT-234 
This was a single arm phase II trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of topotecan and 
cisplatin combinations in patients with persistent or recurrent squamous and non-squamous cell 
carcinomas of the cervix. 
Eligible patients had bidimensionally measurable persistent or recurrent histologically confirmed 
squamous cell or non squamous cell cervical cancer, adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic 
function GOG PS ≤3 and failed or considered incurable with local therapeutic measures. 
Patients were randomized to receive Cisplatin 50 mg/m² IV over 1h (Day 1) and Topotecan 
0.75 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes (Days 1, 2 and 3) every 21 days. 
35 patients were enrolled into the trial.

Primary efficacy endpoint 
- Overall survival: (all-cause mortality) was expressed as the time from randomization until death in 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
- Progression-free survival: the time from randomization until death or relapse in the ITT population. 
- Response rate: the percentage of all eligible patients responding to treatment; i.e., patients with 
complete response or partial response divided by the total number of patients in each group in the ITT 
population. The overall best response categories were categorized as follows: 
Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all gross evidence for at least 4 weeks. 
Partial response (PR): at least a 50% decrease in the cross-product dimensions of each tumor 
compared to the cross-product dimensions reported on the first course of therapy for at least 4 weeks. 
Progressive Disease: at least 50% increase in the cross-product dimensions of any tumor compared to 
the cross-product dimensions reported on the first course of therapy and occurring within 8 weeks of 
study entry or the appearance of any new lesion within 8 weeks of study entry. 
Stable Disease: disease not meeting any of the above 3 response criteria.  
RESULTS 
Overall response rate was 9/32 (evaluable patients out of a total of 35 patients) with a reported median 
survival of 10 months. The regimen was considered tolerable. 
Pivotal Phase III study - GOG-0179 
This was a randomised, open-label, three-arm, comparator controlled phase III study of cisplatin 
versus cisplatin plus topotecan versus methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) in stage 
IVB, recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the cervix. It was a multicentre (47, all US) trial conceived, 
designed and conducted by the GOG (Gynecologic Oncology Group) between Aug 1999 and Dec 
2002.  
The third arm “MVAC” (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) was closed by the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) due to too high toxicity (four treatment related deaths in 63 
patients).

The survival results were similar in the “all randomised population” (p=0.04).  
No appreciable differences were observed between the treatment arms with respect to the use of post-
study (salvage) therapy.  Approximately 44% of topotecan/cisplatin and 42% of cisplatin patients 
received at least one post-study chemotherapy regimen.

Quality of Life 
QoL was assessed using several instruments (FACT-Cx, FACT-NTX, BPI and UNISCALE). Overall 
no differences between treatment groups were detected in this open label study.  
Irrespective of instrument, less affected QoL at baseline predicted for longer time on study, i.e. a better 
prognosis. 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
Study GSK-CRT-234 (Phase II) 
Study GSK-CRT-234 was a single-arm phase II study in patients with incurable cervical cancer. The 
same regimen of cisplatin + topotecan as in the pivotal study was investigated. The overall response 
rate was 9/32 (evaluable patients out of a total of 35 patients). The regimen was considered tolerable.   
Topotecan and cisplatin show essentially non-overlapping toxicities and both have shown 
monotherapy activity in cervical cancer. This constitutes a reasonable rationale to study this doublet in 
the treatment of cervical cancer. 
The topotecan dose/schedule in study GSK-CRT-234 is less dose-intensive than in other combination 
regimens used for the treatment of solid tumours. The rationale for this, prior pelvic radiotherapy, is 
considered reasonable as haematotoxicity is dose limiting for topotecan. The cisplatin dose is 
“standard” in advanced cervical cancer.  
Phase II activity and tolerability for the experimental arm to be used in the main study has been 
demonstrated.

GOG-0179 (Phase III) 
Overall the design of the pivotal study GOG-0179 is considered acceptable from a clinical perspective. 
Locally persistent and recurrent disease, however, is likely to respond differently to chemotherapy.  
Open label is unavoidable due to differences in haematotoxicity. Survival was the primary endpoint, 
however, physical examination plays an important role in clinical practice response evaluations. 
Nevertheless, the supportive value of data on RR and PFS is reduced since no external, blinded review 
of tumour response and progression data was undertaken.  
Closing of the MVAC arm is not considered to constitute a problem from a methodological 
perspective.  
Approximately half of the patients in the pivotal study were previously treated with cisplatin 
containing chemo-radiotherapy. This probably reflects that the study was run between 1999 and 2002, 
while today chemoradiotherapy is considered standard. 
Patients with recurrent tumour constitute the main group of patients. With respect to patients with 
metastatic disease this is probably no major issue, taking the rarity of the condition into account, as the 
sensitivity to chemotherapy is not hampered by prior radio- or chemoradiotherapy. Persistent disease 
after (chemo)-radiotherapy, however, is likely to be predictive of resistance to chemotherapy.   
As expected patients with good performance status predicted a better outcome.   
Altogether 31% in the topotecan-cisplatin arm and 24% in the cisplatin arm were withdrawn from 
study therapy for other reasons than progression or death. In the protocol it is stated: 
- 
Each patient will continue on study for six courses or until disease progression or toxicity 
prohibits further therapy.  Patients in continued response may continue on study with consent 
of the Study Chair but must be reported using GOG forms. 
Patient should be followed until death. 
Report all therapies and toxicities on GOG forms even if the patient is taken off protocol 
therapy until progression is documented. 
- 
- 
Most patients taken off therapy were followed for PFS as only 8 and 11% of the patients were 
censored in the PFS analysis, cisplatin and topotecan-cisplatin, respectively.  
Study data are mature with a low percentage of censored patients. The treatment effect in terms of 
overall survival, however, is of borderline statistical significance and has to be scrutinised as regards 
consistency in relation to reasonably defined treatment subgroups and in relation to secondary 
endpoints and safety. 
Irrespective of outcome measure, the prognosis is worse in patients with a history of prior cisplatin 
chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, the added value of topotecan to cisplatin is clearly smaller. Prior 
cisplatin therapy thus appears to increase the likelihood of resistance to subsequent chemotherapy; 
cisplatin as well as the combination cisplatin and topotecan.  This is considered as a critical finding, as 
cisplatin chemoradiotherapy is considered standard today. 
With respect to time from diagnosis, submitted data are less detailed. As shown in the range plots of 
95% C.I. of Hazard Ratios for Survival in Subgroups, the hazard ratio topotecan-cisplatin/cisplatin 
alone was more favourable in patients with more than 16 months since the original diagnosis although 
it did favour the combination in both subgroups. In ovarian cancer recurrence within 6 (to 12) months 
after end of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is considered as a poor prognostic factor and the tumour is 
considered platinum resistant.  
With reference to Quality of Life, due to the open label nature of the study it can only be concluded 
that major differences between treatment groups are unlikely.

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All in all, 35 patients in the phase II trial and 140 patients in the confirmatory phase III trial were 
exposed to the cisplatin-topotecan combination. This report focuses on the confirmatory study. 
The median number of cisplatin-topotecan courses was 4 with a range of 1 to 20 and 567/628 of the 
courses were administered at the protocol defined starting dose. 
Adverse events 
The reported added events for the combination cisplatin-topotecan compared with cisplatin 
monotherapy were those expected, i.e. essentially events related to myelosuppression. Therefore, 
haematotoxicity is detailed first below, followed by a general overview.

Fatal haemorrhage is a well known complication of cervical cancer, both treated and 
untreated. The submitted safety database supporting the use of combination topotecan 
and cisplatin in patients with cervical cancer reported one case of grade 5 haemorrhage. 
This patient treated with combination therapy died as a result of hemorrhagic complications related to 
tumour bleeding and severe thrombocytopenia.

Massive vaginal bleeding primarily due to tumour progression aggravated by drug-related 
grade IV thrombocytopenia. 
Comatose at time of pancytopenia without signs of intracerebral bleeding. 
Ileus, bowel resection, cardiac arrest, pleura effusion. 
Respiratory infection at time of grade IV neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, ARDS. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety 
Severe bleeding complications at the time of profound thrombocytopenia are expected to occur 
especially in relation to tumour tissue such as in the case reported.  Treatment cannot be excluded as a 
potential contributing factor to the fatalities related to haematological toxicities among the patients 
treated with topotecan/cisplatin (none in the cisplatin treatment arm).  
The differences in the number of haemorrhagic events between the treatment arms may not be 
significant and the reported fatal haemorrhage unique, but inconsistency in the way in which the 
clinical data are reported makes it difficult to judge undisputedly whether the reported deaths were 
treatment related or not. The reported ’patient incidence’ of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 33% in 
the combination arm (vs. 3%).  
Haematotoxicity was also the most common reason for treatment delay (118/187).  
Although the haematotoxicity of the combination regimen is rather profound for a treatment 
administered with palliative intent, toxicity was manageable and the adverse event profile for 
topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin is consistent with that seen with topotecan 
monotherapy. 
The SPC already states that full blood count, including platelets, should be monitored regularly. In 
addition, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC have been revised to state the fact that thrombocytopenia is a 
common adverse effect of the combination therapy and has the potential of leading to fatal 
complications/bleeding and, furthermore, that the risk of haemorrhage should also kept in mind when 
choosing patients who will undergo the treatment.            
Further, the MAH will collect data on haemorrhagic events as part of the routine global clinical safety 
Pharmacovigilance program and will be reviewed as part of the next PSUR. 
Close to 50% of the patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia. The highest incidence was seen in cycle 
1 as expected. There were no signs of obvious cumulative toxicity. Duration of grade 4 neutropenia 
was not reported.  
Altogether 19% grade 3/4 neutropenic fever (vs. 8%) is considered high for a treatment administered 
with palliative intent. 
With respect to “Other gastrointestinal” the difference between treatment groups is explained by 
mucositis/pharyngitis in the combination group.

The dose intensity as measured by need for dose reductions is clearly much lower in the monotherapy 
arm, also if haematotoxicity/neutropenic fever is not taken into account.  
Benefit-risk assessment 
Topotecan as add-on to a standard cisplatin regimen has been demonstrated to result in a borderline 
significant (p=0.03) prolongation of overall survival (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.76, median survival 6.5 and 
9.4 months, respectively) to be weighed against a non-trivial increase in toxicity, especially 
haematotoxicity. Whether benefit-risk in the whole study population has been shown to be favourable 
or not might be disputed. More importantly, however, the study population is heterogeneous and not 
considered to be fully representative of current clinical practice.   
In patients with recurrent disease after cisplatin-radiotherapy, the prognosis was overall worse and the 
added benefit small (HR 0.85, median 5.9 and 7.9 months), compared with patients not administered 
prior chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.51, median 8.8 and 15.7 months). In patients not administered 
cisplatin containing chemoradiotherapy, treatment benefit is considered robust both from a statistical 
and clinical perspective. In this group of patients, data as such indicate that benefit-risk is favourable.  
This subgroup analysis is not considered hypothesis generating as intensity of prior therapy is likely to 
affect activity of later lines of therapy. 
It cannot be excluded that these findings partly reflect a bias in the choice of primary therapy. Patients 
perceived to have a worse prognosis might have been administered chemoradiotherapy more 
frequently as this study was conducted between 1999 and 2002, i.e. during a transitional phase before 
chemoradiotherapy became standard. However, it is considered more likely that the add-on of cisplatin 
to radiotherapy increases the risk of resistance to next-line chemotherapy and it is well known that 
early recurrence after cisplatin-based therapy in patients with, e.g. ovarian carcinoma is associated 
with poor prognosis and platinum resistance.     
Therefore, “persistent disease” after (chemo)radiotherapy was considered highly unlikely to respond to 
cisplatin/topotecan and the number of individuals was much too small for a proper benefit-risk 
assessment based on study data. 
Today, cisplatin-containing chemoradiotherapy is considered standard therapy, but the uptake varies. 
It would therefore be inappropriate to reject the indication altogether. 
In patients with disease resistant to chemo-radiotherapy the likelihood of meaningful activity of 
chemotherapy is low. Study data supports this notion. 
Study data as such are sparse in patients with stage IVB disease, but there are no good reasons to 
assume that the add-on value of topotecan is substantially diminished in this treatment naïve 
population. In terms of response rate, actual data are compatible with this notion. 
From an efficacy perspective the CHMP therefore considers a restricted indication appropriate:  
“Treatment, in combination with cisplatin, of patients with carcinoma of the cervix recurrent after 
radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IV-B disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require 
a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see section 5.1 of the 
SPC).”  
The reported benefit in this group of patients (prior radiotherapy: median survival 16 months versus 9 
months, hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.31; 0.82) is considered to outweigh the increased risk of severe 
haematological side effects when topotecan is added to a standard cisplatin regimen.  
The SPC has been amended accordingly to reflect this message.  
IV. 
 CONCLUSION 
On 19 October 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

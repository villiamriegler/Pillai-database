Introduction 
Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  is  a  heterogeneous  disorder  characterised  by  multiple  defects  in  the 
pancreatic  β-cell,  liver,  and  peripheral  tissues  such  as  skeletal  muscle  and  adipose  tissue.  There  is 
considerable  debate  about  the  primacy  of  insulin  resistance  or  beta  cell  failure  in  the  disorder.  It  is 
well  documented  that  three  major  metabolic  abnormalities  contribute  to  the  development  of 
hyperglycaemia  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  including  impaired  insulin  secretion  in  response  to 
glucose, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased insulin-dependent glucose uptake in the 
peripheral tissues. The latter two abnormalities are defined as insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is 
reversed by enhancing the action of insulin, thereby promoting glucose utilisation in peripheral tissues, 
suppressing  gluconeogenesis  in  the  liver,  and  reducing  lipolysis  at  the  adipocyte.  Insulin  resistance 
appears in early stages of the disease. It is a major factor in the progression of the disease, contributing 
to beta cell exhaustion due to demands on insulin secretion.  
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Europeans is at least 2-3 % and increases substantially in those 
older  than  70  years.  Microvascular  (retinopathy,  nephropathy  and  neuropathy)  and  macrovascular 
complications  (e.g.,  ischemic  heart  disease)  of  diabetes  are  common.  Microvascular  complications 
appear  to  be  related  to  hyperglycaemia.  Macrovascular  complications  are  more  related  to 
dyslipidaemia and blood pressure control. Diet and exercise are the cornerstones of treatment in order 
to correct obesity and hyperglycaemia. However, 40 to 60 % of newly treated patients do not respond 
adequately or fail to comply with diet. Available drug treatments are: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Sulphonylureas  (SU)  which  increase  insulin  secretion.  Their  main  adverse  effects  are 
hypoglycaemia and weight gain. 
Metformin  increases  intestinal  glucose  utilisation,  decreases  hepatic  glucose  production  and 
increases  insulin  sensitivity.  Metformin  may  also  improve  dyslipidaemia.  Gastrointestinal 
undesirable  effects  (e.g.,  diarrhoea  in  about  15%  of  patients)  and  lactic  acidosis  represent  the 
main adverse effects.  
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have shown limited efficacy, but with  no risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Gastrointestinal undesirable effects limit compliance. 
Insulin  is  used  when  oral  agents  have  failed  to  achieve  glycaemic  control  or  in  case  of 
complications. Insulin may cause hypoglycaemia and weight gain. 
The published UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) compared intensive care therapy to standard 
care therapy in a population of 4000 adults over a 9-year period (1977-1997). Results showed a 3-5 % 
rate  of  all  diabetes-related events  per year. Intensive therapy for  glycaemia and  tight blood pressure 
control  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  microvascular  complications.  In  addition,  other 
cardiovascular risk factors including hyperlipidaemia should also be treated. Intensive therapy in the 
UKPDS  produced  a  non-significant  15  %  decrease  in  macrovascular  disease.  Decreasing  glycated 
haemoglobin  (HbA1C)  by  0.7  %  or  achieving  fasting  plasma  glucose  ≤  6  mmol/l  was  found  to  be 
crucial and the various agents used had similar efficacy (UKPDS). All treatment groups shared similar 
outcomes  with  the  exception  of  the  metformin-treated  group.  Mortality  from  all  causes  and  from 
cardiovascular causes was reduced only in the metformin-treated group with intensive plasma glucose 
control.  
Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione compound that acts as a peroxisome proliferator activating receptor 
(PPAR)-γ agonist with potential benefits on insulin resistance. Pioglitazone has a different mechanism 
of action compared to other drugs. It does not stimulate insulin secretion (unlike sulphonylureas), and 
it  does  not  inhibit  glucose  absorption    (unlike  alpha  -glucosidase  inhibitors).  It  depends  on  the 
presence of insulin for activity.

Pioglitazone  is  indicated  as  oral  monotherapy  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients,  particularly 
overweight  patients,  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise    for  whom  metformin  is 
inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. 
Pioglitazone is also indicated for oral combination treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with 
insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of oral monotherapy with either 
metformin or sulphonylurea: 
- 
- 
in combination with metformin particularly in overweight patients 
in combination with a sulphonylurea only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for 
whom metformin is contraindicated 
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15mg or 30mg once daily. The dose may be increased in increments 
up to 45mg once daily. 
2. 
Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Actos tablets contains  pioglitazone hydrochloride as an active substance. Initially, 15 mg and 30 mg 
strengths  were  authorized.  Subsequently,  45  mg  strength  was  authorised.  (see:  steps  taken  after 
authorisation).  
Apart from this difference in strength, the three formulations are identical. The excipients are lactose 
monohydrate, hydroxypropylcellulose, carmellose calcium, and magnesium stearate which are used as 
standard excipients, and the choice of the formulation is well justified. 
The tablets are fast disintegrating conventional-release dosage forms and the formulation is simple..  
The tablets are presented in aluminium blisters sealed with aluminium lidding foil. 
Active substance 
Pioglitazone  hydrochloride  is  produced  by  chemical  synthesis.  Specifications    for  materials  used 
during  synthesis  and  for  the  key  intermediate  are  satisfactory.  Whilst  pioglitazone  has  one  chiral 
centre, the active substance is produced as the racemate. The individual enantiomers have been tested 
and  found  to  have  similar  pharmacological  properties.  The  structure  is  fully  confirmed  by 
spectroscopic  methods.  The  limits  proposed  for  impurities  and  solvents  are  acceptable  and  comply 
with ICH requirements.Pioglitazone is non-hygroscopic and shows no evidence of polymorphism; it is 
practically insoluble in water.  
Information on the manufacturing process has been updated according to the experience gained since 
the authorisation. All of these updates have been evaluated and approved as variation procedures (see 
steps taken after the authorisation). 
Stability of the Active Substance 
Batches of active substance have been tested for stability under long-term and accelerated conditions. 
Data show little or no evidence of degradation under any condition tested. The data demonstrate good 
compliance with the specification, and support the retest period.. 
Other ingredients 
All  excipients  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  monographs.    The  applicant  states  that  the  lactose  used  in 
production of the tablets is obtained from suppliers whose sources are in BSE-free countries and that 
magnesium stearate is either of plant origin or obtained from suppliers who use stearic acid produced 
in a BSE-free country.

Product development and finished product 
Product development 
The  formulation  is  simple,  using  standard  ingredients  and  the  function  of  the  ingredients  has  been 
adequately described. 
Finished product 
The tablets are manufactured in two different sites, both of acceptable GMP status. 
The manufacturing process is standard and well described, and the in-process controls are acceptable.  
Process validation results from three pilot scale batches of each strength showed consistent results and 
good  reproducibility.  Results  from  three  commercial  batches  of  the  lowest  and  highest  strengths 
showed acceptable and comparable results for the two manufacturing sites. The specification for the 
finished product is typical of a conventional-release tablet, and includes tests with justified limits for 
content of active substance, uniformity of content, dissolution and microbial contamination. Analytical 
methods for batch release have been suitably validated.  
Stability of the Product 
Three batches of each strength were placed in the proposed marketing containers under long-term ICH 
conditions and 6 months under accelerated conditions. 
The  stability  results  of  batches  stored  in  the  commercial  pack  support  the  shelf  life  and  storage 
conditions stated in the SPC. 
Bioequivalence  
The  formulation  of  the  15 mg,  30 mg  and  45  mg  tablets  used  in  all  Phase  II  and  Phase  III  clinical 
studies were identical to the commercial formulations. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical aspects 
The  pharmaceutical  documentation  showed 
the  product  was  acceptable. 
Physicochemical  aspects  relevant  to  the  clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of pioglitazone on insulin-induced intracellular 
signalling,  glucose  and  lipid  metabolism,  glucose  tolerance  and  insulin  sensitivity  using  normal, 
obese,  and  genetically  hyperglycaemic/obese  animals  as  models  of  NIDDM  and  the  streptozocin-
induced rat model of IDDM. The pharmacodynamic studies support the use of pioglitazone in NIDDM 
although the mechanism of action is not well characterised at the cellular level. 
• 
In vitro studies 
It was shown that pioglitazone does not bind to the insulin receptor but is a specific activator of the 
human PPARγ, and is less potent for the PPARα and β. 
• 
In vivo studies 
In mouse, rat and dog models of NIDDM,  pioglitazone decreased hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, 
and glucose intolerance. Results suggested that insulin was necessary for the action of pioglitazone. 
• 
General and safety pharmacology programme 
Pioglitazone did not exert relevant effects on the CNS or ANS in mice and cats, or haemodynamics in 
anaesthetised dogs.  Oral  pioglitazone produced a significant decrease in urinary volume and sodium 
excretion in rats compared with placebo or hydrochlorothiazide 
Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Absorption 
Following  oral  administration,  a  linear  dose:  exposure  relationship  was  found  but  the  increase  was 
3/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
slightly sub-proportional in the dose range (0.5-30 mg/kg in rats, 0.1-3.0 mg/kg in dogs). Absorption 
and bioavailability were high in all species with low first pass effect.  
• 
Distribution 
Radioactivity  distribution  was  wide  and  represented  primarily  by  the  parent  drug  in  all  tissues.  The 
volume  of  distribution  is  low  with  low  distribution  to  RBC.  Pioglitazone  is  highly  bound  to  plasma 
proteins, mainly albumin. Rapid chiral inversion was found in vitro and in vivo in animals and in vitro 
in  humans.  There  was  no  appreciable  accumulation  after  repeat  administration  of  pioglitazone. 
Maximum  exposure  was  observed  in  the  liver  and  brown  fat.  Radio-labelled  pioglitazone  and 
metabolites  cross  the  placenta,  and  are  distributed  in  foetal  tissues  and  were  found  in  the  milk  of 
lactating  rats  at  levels  below  that  found  in  the  maternal  plasma.  Pioglitazone  is  not  recommended 
during pregnancy or breast-feeding. 
• 
Metabolism 
identified,  metabolites  MII,  MIII  and  MIV  are  primarily  responsible  for 
Metabolism  takes  place  primarily  in  the  liver  and  kidney.  Six  major  and  several  minor  metabolites 
have  been 
the 
pharmacological  activity  (MIV  is  the  main  metabolite  in  man).  No  induction/inhibition  of  specific 
hepatic enzymes was found in vitro. The major contributors to pioglitazone metabolism were the CYP 
isoforms 2C8 and 3A4. 
• 
Excretion 
In rodents and dogs, most of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces but in monkeys, there is 
high urinary excretion.  
• 
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetic  data  were  obtained  in  mice,  rats,  dogs,  and  monkeys  for  pioglitazone  and  for  the 
metabolites MII, MIII and MIV in rats. Data confirm high exposure of the animals to pioglitazone in 
toxicology studies, although exposure fell with time in most species. 
Toxicology 
The  toxicology  programme  was  performed  according  to  current  requirements  and  all  pivotal  studies 
were GLP compliant. 
• 
Acute, single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity was assessed in mice, rats (oral and ip) and Cynomolgus monkeys (oral gavage). 
In  rats  and  mice,  decreased  activity,  respiratory  depression,  and  hypo-reactivity  were  observed.  At 
necropsy,  lung  hyperaemia,  ascites,  interlobar  adhesion  of  the  liver,  and  remnant  test  article  in  the 
peritoneal  cavity  were  found.  No  deaths  or  clinical  signs  were  observed  in  monkeys  with  up  to 
240 mg/kg oral dose. 
• 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated oral dosing studies with pioglitazone were carried out for 13 weeks in mice, and for up to one 
year  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Effects  that  were  evident  across  species  comprised  increased  body 
weight  and  fat  mass,  decreased  haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  circulating  erythrocytes,  platelets  and 
protein; prolonged prothrombin time; increased heart and liver weight, proliferation of adipose tissue 
(increased deposition of white and brown fat and fatty infiltration of bone marrow, spleen and parotid 
gland),  extramedullary  haematopoiesis  and  myocardial  hypertrophy.  Mortality was  dose  related,  and 
appears to be related to heart failure or dysfunction. Evidence was provided to demonstrate that these 
effects, with the exception of cardiac enlargement, were reversible after withdrawal of treatment. 
Effects on heart size and myocardial function were examined. A comparative study was carried out in 
young, lean, normal, and old, fatty, insulin-resistant female beagle dogs for 13 weeks. The study showed a 
correlation  between  increased  plasma  volume  and  induction  of  eccentric  bi-ventricular  cardiac 
hypertrophy,  pericardial  and  pleural  effusion.  This  study  also  showed  that  increases  in  plasma  volume 
were  less  marked  in  fatty  (presumed  insulin  resistant)  than  lean  dogs  and  that  by  the  end  of  the  study 
plasma  exposure  was  20%  higher  in  lean  dogs.  Further  investigations  in  rodents  showed  that  the 
susceptibility  to  increases  in  heart  weight  and  plasma  volume  is  dependent  on  ‘insulin’  status  being 
more  easily  expressed  in  normo-glycaemic  animals  than  those  with  insulin  resistance.  It  was  also 
4/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
shown that co-administration  of a  diuretic reduces  the  magnitude of the increases  in plasma volume 
and heart weight associated with treatment of normo-glycaemic rodents with pioglitazone alone. 
The no observable effects levels (NOELs) in all of the toxicology species were at plasma exposures 
that were close  (≤ 4 times) to the average human exposure. 
• 
Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  pioglitazone  was  studied  in  the  standard  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  systems  for 
detection  of  mutations  and  chromosomal  damage.    Additional  studies  included  assessment  for 
induction  of  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  in  cultured  hepatocytes  and  a  bacterial  mutagenicity  study 
with concentrated urine obtained from rats given high oral doses of pioglitazone. In vitro bacterial and 
mammalian genotoxicity assays were also carried out with the  metabolites (M-I, M-II, M-III, M-IV, 
M-V,  and  M-VI).  Genotoxic  potential  was  not  demonstrated  in  these  studies  at  non-cytotoxic 
concentrations. 
• 
Carcinogenicity 
Mice and rats were given pioglitazone for 24-months by gavage. In mice there were no other findings 
than those already noted in repeat dose toxicity studies. There was no evidence of a treatment-related 
increase  in  neoplasms.  In  rats,  findings  also  mirrored  the  results  of  chronic  toxicity  studies.  In 
addition, the urinary bladder showed an increased incidence of epithelial hyperplasia in both sexes. In 
female rats, the hyperplasia was statistically significantly increased at 63 mg/kg/day. Transitional cell 
adenoma/carcinoma  of  the  urinary  bladder  epithelium  were  seen  in  males  only,  at  4  mg/kg/day  or 
more and reached statistical significance at 8 mg/kg/day.. Since pioglitazone is not genotoxic and not 
carcinogenic  in  mice,  and  tumours  were  only  observed  in  male  rats,  an  epigenetic  mechanism  of 
tumourigenesis  is  probable.  It  is  suggested  that  urinary  calculi  formation  with  subsequent  irritation, 
hyperplasia  and  metaplasia  may  be  responsible  for  the  carcinogenic  response  seen  in  male  rats. 
Analysis of all slides of male urinary bladder from this study suggest that the correlation between the 
presence  of  mineralisation  and/or  urinary  calculi,  and  nodular/papillary  hyperplasia  and  transitional 
cell tumours in males was 61 %.  
A  complementary  13-week  study  was  performed  in  aged  rats,  which  showed  that  pioglitazone 
treatment did not increase the incidence of spontaneous calculi formation.  
Possible  site-specific  genotoxicity and  a  possible role of PPAR  activation in  the  induction/inhibition  of 
apoptosis  were  discussed.  The  fact  that  epithelial  hyperplasia  and  bladder  tumours  occurred  within  the 
clinical  exposure  range  (less  than  3  times  the  human  exposure  in  term  of  AUC)  in  male  rats  was 
considered..  
• 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A standard series of reproduction toxicity studies was conducted with pioglitazone in rats and rabbits. 
In fertility studies there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or fertility index. Pioglitazone is non-
teratogenic  in  both  rats  and  rabbits.  High  doses  were  associated  with  maternal  toxicity  (e.g.,  placental 
pathology, weight loss), implantation losses, reduced foetal size, live birth weight and survival ratios, and 
delayed pup development. It is suggested that the adverse effects on the offspring result from disturbances 
in maternal physiology rather than a direct toxic effect. This is supported by differences in maternal and 
foetal NOEL. The foetal NOEL is approximately 3-fold higher than the maternal, which is 2-4-fold the 
maximum human exposure. Possible effects when physiology is normalised rather than disturbed, cannot 
accurately be predicted. Available evidence suggests that pioglitazone should not be recommended at any 
stage of pregnancy. This is reflected in the SPC. 
• 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
No environmental impact is anticipated from the clinical use of pioglitazone.HCl. 
Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pioglitazone and its metabolites are devoid of genotoxic potential as assessed in a standard battery of 
tests.  In  carcinogenicity  studies,  bladder  hyperplasia  occurred  in  male  rats  and  high  dose  group 
females.  Bladder  tumours  were  found  in  male  rats  only,  at  exposure  levels  close  to  that  of  human 
exposure  (less  than  3  times  the  human  exposure  in  term  of  AUC).  This  finding  was  discussed  and 
5/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
particular attention has been paid to human data in this regard. Clinical trial data and the follow up of 
patients,  including  urine  cytology,  did  not  raise  any  concern.  A  case  control  study  will  address  this 
issue  post  marketing.  In  toxicity  studies,  in  all  species  pioglitazone  was  shown  to  produce  heart 
enlargement and hypertrophy, cardiac insufficiency and plasma volume expansion with oedema, and 
anaemia, to various extents. Fat tissue increase and/or redistribution were also observed. Most of the 
effects seen in chronic animal toxicity studies indicated a need for supplementary clinical data and that 
particular attention be paid to these affected parameters post marketing.  
4. 
Clinical aspects 
Clinical Pharmacology 
The  Applicant  conducted  28  studies  in  volunteers  or  diabetic  patients.  A  total  of  445  non  diabetic 
subjects received at least one dose of pioglitazone, including 12 subjects with hepatic impairment, 21 
with renal impairment, and 22 elderly subjects.  In addition 111 type-2 diabetic patients were studied. 
Pharmacodynamics 
• 
Mechanism of action 
Preclinical studies suggested that pioglitazone is a PPARγ agonist that may reduce insulin resistance. 
PPARγ  activation  alters  patterns  of  gene  expression  in  target  tissues  either  directly  or  indirectly. 
PPARγ activation does not affect insulin production or release.  
• 
Dynamic studies 
In healthy volunteers, it was shown that pioglitazone did  not produce hypoglycaemia. No  consistent 
changes in insulin and peptide C, or glucose rise after a test-meal, were found but some reduction in 
post-prandial insulin release was in favour of an improvement in insulin sensitivity. 
An  open  study  in  type  2  diabetic  patients  assessed  insulin  sensitivity  by  the  euglycaemic 
hyperinsulinaemic  clamp  technique  before  and  after  12  weeks  of  pioglitazone  (30 mg  once  daily). 
Peripheral glucose uptake increased significantly from 5.48 to 8.27 mg/kg/min. 
A  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  was  performed  using  an  ‘artificial  pancreatic  islet’  before 
and  after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Insulin  sensitivity  increased  with  pioglitazone  but  in  the  same 
proportion as with placebo. However, an effect on hepatic glucose uptake was demonstrated.  
Other  studies  in  diabetic  patients  showed  improvement  in  FBG  and  post  prandial  BG,  the 
hypoglycaemic effect being sustained for 24 hours. The effect appeared within 2 weeks of treatment. 
Statistically significant weight gain was observed in patients receiving pioglitazone.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites in serum and urine were analysed by HPLC and MS 
detection. 
• 
Absorption 
In  a  single  dose,  2-way  cross  over  study,  7  male  healthy  volunteers  received  a  7.5-mg  oral  dose  of 
pioglitazone and an intravenous dose of 5 mg over 2 hrs. Mean absolute bioavailability was more than 
80%. Absorption was rapid with maximum serum concentrations, Cmax (typically 900 ng/ml after a 30-
mg dose) occurred within 1-3 hr. Exposure (AUC) after oral administration of a 30-mg dose is usually 
about  8000    ng/ml.  Dose  proportionality  within  a  dose  range  of  2-60  mg  was  shown  in  single  and 
repeat dose studies. T½ was usually between 3-6 hr, and seemed independent of the dose and health 
status (healthy adults, young or elderly, or diabetics). Two studies on the effect of food on absorption 
were performed (in Japan and in the US due to differences in diet). Food delayed the rate of absorption 
from about 2 hr to 3-4 h post dose but the extent of absorption was unchanged.  
• 
Distribution 
After  iv  administration,  the  volume  of  distribution  was  found  to  be  about  0.25 ± 0.03  l/kg. 
Pioglitazone is highly bound to plasma proteins (97-99 %), mostly albumin.  
6/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
• 
Metabolism 
Pioglitazone  is  extensively  metabolised  in  the  liver  (oxidative  biotransformation).  Six  metabolites 
have  been  identified  in  man  (MI-MVI),  the  main  being  MIII  and  MIV  (a  precursor  of  MIII  and 
corresponding  to  the  predominant  route),  both  having  pharmacological  activity,  in  particular 
hypoglycaemic activity.  
In  vitro  studies  on  human  hepatocytes  showed  minimal  inhibition  of  pioglitazone  on  CYP  isoforms 
(1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4). The main contributors were CYP 3A4, 
1A1, and 2C8. Pioglitazone had no significant inducing effect on CYP isoforms. Pioglitazone in vivo 
had no effect on the ratio 6-β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol in urine indicating no inducing effect on CYP 
3A4.  
• 
Elimination 
Pioglitazone  is  slowly  cleared  from  the  blood  despite  the  small  volume  of  distribution.  Serum 
concentrations decrease approximately mono-exponentially over time. T½ was usually between 3-6 hr 
and  seemed  independent  of  the  dose  and  health  status.  MIII  and  MIV  metabolites  have  longer  half-
lives than the parent compound, of about 27-30 hr. Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible. The 
contribution of renal and biliary routes to the excretion of pioglitazone metabolites was investigated in 
a mass balance study using 14C-pioglitazone. Faeces accounted for 55% of the recovered label.  
• 
Special groups 
Type 2 diabetics 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  main  kinetic  parameters  were  observed  between  healthy 
volunteers  and  diabetics.  In  addition,  Ctrough  levels  of  pioglitazone  and  its  metabolites,  measured  in 
long-term clinical trials indicated that there was no accumulation. 
Elderly 
Two studies were performed. In elderly Japanese, lower Cmax and AUC values were observed whilst 
metabolism  and  clearance  seemed  unchanged  as  compared  to  young  healthy  volunteers.  In  the  US, 
elderly had about 20% increase in AUC with a slightly lower oral clearance. However, concentrations 
and exposure remained in the overall range seen in other studies of non-elderly populations. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone were studied in 27 patients, 6 without renal impairment, 9 with 
creatinine  clearance:  30-60 ml/min  and  12  with  creatinine clearance < 30  ml/min. As expected renal 
impairment  had  no  significant  effect  on  pioglitazone  kinetics.  No  metabolite  accumulation  was 
observed. No dose adjustment is thus necessary in patients with renal failure. 
Hepatic impairment 
A single dose study was performed in 12  male  subjects  with  mild to  moderate  chronic liver  disease 
(Child-Pugh score ≥ 6), and  12 healthy volunteers. After an oral dose of 30 mg pioglitazone, AUCs  
were  comparable.  However,  Cmax  was  about  60  %  of  that  of  normal  subjects.  The  volume  of 
distribution  was  increased  (155  %)  probably  due  to  decreased  albumin  levels  and  protein  binding. 
Thus,  the  unbound  fraction  of  pioglitazone  might  be  increased  in  patients  with  liver  impairment. 
Substantially lower levels of MIII metabolite suggested impaired oxidative biotransformation of MIV 
to MIII. Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, this is addressed in the 
SPC. 
Obese volunteers 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those of normal healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment 
seems necessary in obese subjects. 
Gender effects 
Slightly  higher  values  for  Cmax  and  AUC  with  delayed  tmax  were  obtained  in  female  subjects  due  to 
lower body weight. However, these changes should not be of clinical relevance. 
7/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
Children 
No  clinical  studies  or  trials  were  performed  in  adolescents  or  children.  Due  to  the  lack  of  trials, 
pioglitazone is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. 
• 
Interaction studies 
A  formal  in  vivo  interaction  study  was  performed  with  warfarin  and  showed  no  changes  in 
pharmacokinetics parameters. Four prospective clinical studies investigated the effect of pioglitazone 
upon  kinetic  parameters  of  concomitantly  administered  sulphonylureas,  metformin,  warfarin, 
phenprocoumon  and  digoxin.  Concomitant  administration  of  pioglitazone  had  no  effect  on  serum 
concentrations or protein binding of SUs (glipizide and glibenclamide). SUs had no effect on serum 
concentrations of pioglitazone. No change in metformin kinetic parameters was found and metformin 
had  no  effect  on  serum  concentrations  of  pioglitazone.  There  was  no  indication  that  pioglitazone 
(45 mg once daily) altered the efficacy of phenprocoumon or warfarin. The AUC of digoxin was not 
altered by concomitant administration of pioglitazone. 
Clinical efficacy  
The original Marketing Authorisation Application included data from studies in monotherapy and in 
combination therapy. During the original application, the efficacy of pioglitazone in monotherapy was 
considered to be insufficiently documented. In subsequent applications (January 2003) additional data 
were submitted to support the use of pioglitazone in monotherapy and also additional data to support 
the increase of the maximum daily dose from 30 mg to 45 mg. 
The clinical and efficacy programme in the MAA consisted of 19 trials, 3 of which were performed in 
Europe,  8  in  the  US  and  8  in  Japan.  Clinical  trials  are  double-blind,  randomised,  parallel  groups, 
controlled trials. In addition, open trials are presented.  
Double blind studies 
Monotherapy included 2017 patients taking pioglitazone (677 patients taking comparator). 
Combination therapy included 1518 patients taking pioglitazone (673 patients taking comparator).   
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  according  to  GCP  standards  and  agreed  international  ethical 
principles.

*Some patients may have participated in more than one trial 
Patient population 
At screening, 60-80 % of patients were considered as not adequately controlled on one or more anti-
diabetic agents (HbA1C ≥ 8 %). A proportion of naive patients was included in the trials, but was not 
studied independently of previously treated patients. It should also be noted that type II diabetics with 
congestive heart failure (CHF) of  New-York Heart  Association  grade III and  IV were  excluded, but 
patients with other cardiovascular diseases were not. 
Endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  HbA1C  change  from  baseline  in  comparison  to  placebo  in  most  studies. 
HbA1C is the commonly accepted variable  but is  not sensitive for short-term evaluations; thus, FBG 
was the chosen primary endpoint in some short-term studies.  
Secondary  endpoints  included  FBG  [oral  glucose  tolerance  test  (OGTT)],  insulin  and  peptide  C. 
Fasting lipids (triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol) were measured in most studies.  
In  some  studies,  evaluation  endpoints  included  responder  rates:  responders  were  defined  as  patients 
with  a  change  in  HbA1C  ≥  0.6  %  from  baseline  to  last  value,  and/or  achieving  normalisation  (i.e., 
HbA1C ≤ 6.1 %).  In addition to efficacy endpoints, safety endpoints were recorded (see Safety). 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  was  to  test  treatment  effects  between  pioglitazone  and  placebo  (analysis  of 
covariance  model)  with  the  factor  ‘treatment’  and  ‘baseline  HbA1C’  as  covariates.  Last  observation 
carried  forward  (LOCF)  was  used  for  missing  values.  The  Least  Significant  Difference  method  was 
used for pairwise comparisons. P-value and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. 
Results on the ITT population are presented. The ITT population represents all patients with at least 
one intake of study medication after randomisation and availability of baseline HbA1C and at least one 
post-baseline HbA1C value. The Per Protocol population is the ITT population with HbA1C value at 12 
weeks or later and no major protocol violations before unblinding.

With  30-45mg  of  pioglitazone  there  was  approximately  0.8 %  decrease  in  HbA1c  and  30-40  mg/dl 
decreases in FBG. Effects on secondary endpoints showed similar effects, while unchanged in placebo

groups.  Fasting  peptide  C  levels  showed  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  pioglitazone-treated 
groups.  Similar  results  were  observed  for  fasting  insulin  levels.  Blood  glucose  in  OGTT  tests  was 
significantly  decreased.  A  decrease  in  triglycerides  was  observed  across  studies  in  the  pioglitazone 
treated groups (with the exception of the 15-mg group in CCT-001) when compared to baseline, but 
not to placebo. No change in total and LDL-cholesterol was found compared to placebo. Statistically 
significant decreases in free fatty acids were observed at some time points.  
No statistically significant changes in diastolic and systolic blood pressure were observed. 
Overall, dose ranging studies showed that pioglitazone reduced hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetics at 
doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg. There was some evidence of a dose-response effect. Doses below 
15  mg  did  not  show  efficacy,  and  the  doses  beyond  45  mg  (once  daily)  did  not  show  additional 
efficacy. 
Main clinical trials   
•  Monotherapy studies 
There  were  two  monotherapy  placebo-controlled  trials.  With  respect  to  baseline  characteristics,  US 
and Japanese patients differed by mean baseline HbA1C, FBG and BMI, but in each trial, there were no 
differences  between  groups  at  baseline.  Patients  were  not  stratified  according  to  previous  treatment 
(e.g.,  never  treated  patients,  switched  patients  and  therapeutic  failures).  Run-in  periods  were  5  and 
4 weeks respectively.

At endpoint (16 weeks for PNFP-026 and 12 weeks for CCT-011), pioglitazone significantly reduced 
both HbA1c and FBG in both trials as compared to placebo. The effects of pioglitazone on secondary 
endpoints showed a significant reduction in fasting C-peptide and insulin in PNFP-026.  
Triglyceride  levels  decreased  significantly  in  the  pioglitazone-treated  group  as  compared  to  placebo 
(p ≤ 0.05)  in  PNFP-026  and  as  compared  to  baseline  in  CCT011.  In  PNFP-026,  LDL-cholesterol 
remained unchanged and HDL-cholesterol increased significantly as compared to placebo (p≤0.05). 
In  controlled  monotherapy  studies,  a  mean  weight  gain  of  1.4 kg  and  3.0  kg  (in  European  and  US 
trials, respectively) was seen using up to 45 mg pioglitazone. 
Considering the chronic nature of type 2 diabetes, these trials are however of short duration (16 and 12 
weeks  for  the  US  and  Japanese  trials,  respectively).  Moreover,  the  population  enrolled  was 
heterogeneous.

Some  patients  were  included  after  failure  of  other  antidiabetic  agents,  at  least  30%  of  patients  with 
secondary  failure  achieved  a  response  defined  by  a  reduction  in  HbA1c  ≥  0.6%  or  a  final 
HbA1c ≤ 6.1%. 
• 
Monotherapy trial versus active control 
This double-blind trial (EC 204) was of 26-week duration, after a 4 to 8-week wash-out period. After 8 
weeks of treatment, the study dose (either pioglitazone 30 mg or glibenclamide 2.5  mg) was titrated 
upward when the change in HbA1c did not reach 0.3 % (pioglitazone 45 mg or glibenclamide 5 mg). 
The glibenclamide dose used in this trial was considered sub-optimal as a 10 or 15-mg maximal dose 
would have been more appropriate. ANCOVA analysis was carried out to test equal treatment effects 
between pioglitazone and active comparator.

Pioglitazone as well as glibenclamide showed superior efficacy to placebo. Although the trial was not 
aimed  at  comparing  glibenclamide  with  pioglitazone,  confidence  intervals  show  that  glibenclamide 
produced  greater  -  although  not  statistically  significant  -  decreases  in  HbA1C  and  FBG.  This  was 
obtained 
in  spite  of  sub-optimal  doses  of  glibenclamide.  Pioglitazone  decreased  whereas 
glibenclamide  increased  fasting  C-peptide  levels;  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference 
between pioglitazone and glibenclamide. 
Pioglitazone  decreased  diastolic  blood  pressure  compared  to  both  glibenclamide  and  placebo,  but 
increased systolic blood pressure with a mean change of 1.0 mm Hg. 
The  mean  weight  increase  was  +1.2  kg  with  pioglitazone  as  compared  to  +0.8  kg  and  –1.5  kg  for 
glibenclamide and placebo, respectively. 
LDL-cholesterol values did not differ significantly between groups.HDL-cholesterol values increased 
in  all  treatment  groups.  Pairwise  comparison  revealed  that  pioglitazone  was  associated  with 
significantly  greater  increases  in  HDL-cholesterol  than  placebo  (p  =  0.01)  and  glibenclamide  (p  = 
0.0001). 
• 
Forced escalation dose trial 
In addition, a placebo-controlled trial was carried out in the US with patients (mean BMI: 30.9 kg/m2) 
receiving increasing doses of pioglitazone (7.5/15/30 mg or 15/30/45 mg, increases after periods of 4 
weeks)  over  24  weeks.  The  run-in  period  lasted  for  2-6  weeks.  Significant  decreases  in  HbA1C  and 
FBG  were  observed  as  compared  with  placebo,  but  no  differences  between  the  2  active  treatment 
arms.  
No changes were observed in fasting peptide-C and insulin, or in blood pressure. 
A significant decrease in triglyceride concentrations was found between the 15/30/45 mg and placebo 
groups at week 16 and 24.

Long term trials 
Four  open  trials  (1162  patients  entered,  1095  completed)  were  performed  in  order  to  evaluate 
tolerability  and  safety.  They  included  patients  from  previous  controlled  trials.  In  the  two  Japanese 
trials (OCT-001 and 016), SUs could be used in combination with pioglitazone; these trials were of 48 
and  28  week  duration.  Both  European  and  US  trials  (EC-202,  PNFP-011  respectively)  lasted  for  52 
weeks.  
Overall,  comparisons  of  the  decrease  in  HbA1C  and  FBG  showed  a  slightly  greater  effect  in  women 
than  in  men,  but  no  differences  according  to  age  (<65  y.  or  ≥65  y.)  or  previous  anti-diabetic  drugs 
used.  
In PNFP-011, for HbA1C there was a mean decrease from baseline of 1.35% (1.57% for the de novo 
group  of  patients  and  1.03%  for  the  rollover  pioglitazone  group);  the  mean  weight  change  from 
baseline was 5.56 kg at week 48. At week 48 the percentage of patients classified as responders were 
76.2%  in  the  de  novo  group,  56.5%  in  the  rollover  placebo  group  and  58.8%  in  the  rollover 
pioglitazone group.  
In  the  Japanese  studies,  HbA1C  showed  a  decrease  of  1.17-1.60%  in  patients  taking  pioglitazone  in 
conjunction with diet and a decrease of 1.15-1.18% in patients taking pioglitazone in conjunction with 
SU.   
In EC-202, the mean HbA1C decrease from baseline was 0.87% and mean weight change from baseline 
was +1.4 ± 3.8 kg in patients completing one-year treatment with pioglitazone. In the European study, 
mean total cholesterol increased by 1.9 %, LDL decreased by 0.4 % while there was a rise by 15.2 % 
in HDL and triglycerides decreased by 7.1 %.  Similar results were found in the Japanese study.  
No change in blood pressure was observed in these trials.

Combination therapy  
Combination with sulphonylureas (985 patients) 
Three  placebo-controlled  trials  [of  which  two  were  double-blind  –  CCT-012  (12  weeks)  and  PNFP-
010  (16  weeks)  and  one  single-blind  OCT-003  (12  weeks)]  were  performed  in  patients  already 
receiving sulphonylureas (mostly glibenclamide) at about 60-70 % of the recommended dose. The SU 
dose was to remain constant throughout the trial (unless hypoglycaemia occurred). Other anti-diabetic 
agents (e.g., metformin or acarbose) were discontinued. The run-in periods were 1 or 4 weeks for trial 
PNFP-010, and 4 weeks for OCT-003 and CCT-012.

Significant differences were found for both HbA1C and FBG with all 3 doses of pioglitazone + SU as 
compared to placebo + SU. In PNFP-010, 10.2 % of patients on placebo + SU had HbA1C < 8 % at 
endpoint compared with 28.8 and 36 % in pioglitazone 15 and 30 mg groups + SU.

Between  group  analysis  revealed  significant  reductions  in  triglycerides  and  free  fatty  acids  by 
pioglitazone + SU as compared with placebo + SU. Between group analysis in both studies PNFP-010 
and CCT-012 revealed significant increases in HDL-cholesterol with the 15-mg and 30-mg doses of 
pioglitazone in combination with SU as compared to the placebo + SU group. LDL-cholesterol values 
were increased in study PNFP-010 as compared to baseline, but were reduced compared to placebo. 
LDL was not measured in study OCT-003 or CCT-012.  
Body weight increased with all doses of pioglitazone. The heaviest mean weight increase was 3.06 kg 
in PNFP-010 (pioglitazone 30 mg). 
Open long term extension studies  
A total of 236 patients entered the open extension study (PNFP-031) from the controlled pioglitazone 
+ SU study (PNFP-010).  Patients who had been on placebo in the original double-blind study were 
transferred to pioglitazone (roll-over placebo group) whilst those originally on pioglitazone continued 
on this therapy (roll-over pioglitazone group). 76 patients had originally been on placebo, and 160 on 
pioglitazone  in  the  double-blind  study.    166  patients  completed  48  weeks  of  treatment,  and  137 
completed  72  weeks.  Metabolic  control  results  show  a  good  maintenance  of  effect  over  time,  and 
LOCF values suggest that patients withdrawing did not have a major impact on the results. 
The  CPMP  requested  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  efficacy  (and  safety)  results  in  the  subset  of  diabetic 
population where there might be an unmet medical need, i.e., the patients insufficiently controlled on 
SU  but  who  cannot  tolerate  metformin.  The  Applicant  provided  information  concerning  patients 
possibly  not  tolerating  metformin  or  in  whom  metformin  is  not  recommended  (i.e.,  GI  symptoms, 
age ≥ 65 years, creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dl, BMI < 25 kg/m2). 
In the US controlled trial of the combination SU + pioglitazone (16-week PNFP-010 study), 209 out of 
373  patients  were  not  suitable  candidates  for  metformin.  Similar  changes  in  HbA1C  (an  approx.  1% 
reduction) and in FBG to those seen in the total population were found in this group of 209 patients 
following combination therapy of pioglitazone and SU. 
In the Japanese studies, metformin was not indicated or possibly not tolerated in 139/207 patients and 
in  57/75  patients,  OCT-003  and  CCT-012  studies  respectively.  The  response  to  pioglitazone  in 
combination with SU was similar in those patients to that in the total study populations. 
Two open long-term studies pioglitazone (15/30/45mg)+ SU combination were conducted in Japan. In 
OCT-001, 133 patients completed ≥  48 weeks and in  OCT-016,  49  patients completed  28  weeks. In 
OCT-001  and  OCT-016,  metformin  was  not  indicated  or  not  tolerated  in  97  and  42  patients 
respectively.    Changes  in  HbA1C  suggest  that  the  ‘not  indicated  /  not  tolerated’  group  has  similar 
efficacy to the total groups of patients in OCT-001 and OCT-016. 
• 
Combination with insulin (566 patients) 
Patients  with  type  II  diabetes,  poorly  controlled  on  insulin  (chronic  treatment  ≥4  months)  were 
randomised either to placebo or pioglitazone for 16 weeks after a 4-week run-in period (PNFP-014). 
Other anti-diabetic agents were discontinued. The mean BMI was about 33-34 kg/m2. 
The  addition  of  pioglitazone  decreased  HbA1C  (-0.73  %  [95%CI:-1.00;-0.47]  at  15  mg  and  -1.00  % 
[95%CI: -1.27;-0.74] at 30 mg, and fasting C-peptide. Initial insulin dose could be reduced in 2.1 %, 
3.7 % and 16 % of the placebo, pioglitazone 15 mg, and 30 mg treated patients, respectively. In PNFP-
014, 12.8 % of patients on placebo had HbA1C < 8 % at endpoint compared with 31.4 and 41.5 % in 
pioglitazone 15 and 30 mg groups, respectively. 
Body weight gain was observed in patients treated with both pioglitazone doses, the maximum mean 
levels 
increase  being  +3.9 kg.  From  week  8, 
(insulin+pioglitazone  30  mg)  and  significant  increases  in  HDL-cholesterol  were  observed,  as 
compared to insulin+placebo.

• 
Combination with metformin (328 patients) 
This trial (PNFP-027) compared one dose (30 mg) of pioglitazone  + metformin  with  metformin + 
placebo  in  a  total  of  328  patients  (mean  BMI:  32 kg/m2)  poorly  controlled  (HbA1C   ≥ 8  %)  by 
metformin  (with  or  without  SU  or  acarbose)  over  16  weeks.  The  run-in  period  was  1  or  4  weeks. 
Patients  stopped  other  antidiabetic  agents  and  remained  on  their  current  dose  of  metformin  (patient 
were taking about 60 % of the maximum recommended dose). The dose of metformin was acceptable 
as the maximum dose is generally poorly tolerated.  
HbA1C significantly decreased by 0.83 % [95 %CI: -1.15, -0.51] and FBG by 37.7 mg/dl [95 %CI: -
49.3,  -26.0]  in  the  pioglitazone  treated  group.  Responder  rates  (i.e.,  change  in  HbA1C  ≥  0.6  %  from 
baseline  to  last  value,  or  achieving  normalisation:  HbA1C  ≤  6.1  %)  were  54  %  and  21.6  %  in  the 
pioglitazone and the placebo groups, respectively.  
There  was  no  difference  in  the  response  obtained  in  patients  treated  with  either  < 2000  mg 
or > 2000 mg metformin doses. 
There  were  statistically  significant  mean  decreases  in  triglycerides  and  mean  increases  in  HDL-
cholesterol  as  compared  with  placebo.  LDL-cholesterol  was  not  measured  for  patients  whose 
triglycerides  were  >400  mg/dl  at  a  given  visit.  There  were  no  significant  differences  in  LDL-
cholesterol or total cholesterol (TC) between treatment groups although for both measures there were 
small  significant  increases  from  baseline  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  calculated  (from  the  mean 
values) HDL/TC ratio increased by 10%. 
Body  weight  decreased  in  the  metformin + placebo  group  (-1.36  kg)  and  increased  in  the 
metformin + pioglitazone group (+0.95 kg). The difference between groups was not significant. 
Open long term extension study 
154  patients  from  PNFP-027 entered the open long-term  extension study. Patients who had been on 
placebo in the original double-blind study were transferred to pioglitazone (roll-over  placebo group) 
whilst those originally on pioglitazone continued on this therapy (roll-over pioglitazone group).  81 of 
these had previously received pioglitazone (+ metformin) and 73 placebo (+ metformin).  108 patients 
were followed for ≥ 48 weeks and 96 up to 72 weeks.  The decrease in HbA1C was maintained for up 
to 72 weeks and the last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis suggests only a small effect due 
to drop outs. Phase I and II studies indicate that pioglitazone has an effect on FBG within 2 weeks and 
on HbA1c after 8 weeks and that both effects plateau by 14-16 weeks.   
While  there  are  no  long-term  controlled  trials  available  in  combination,  from  the  controlled  and 
observational data it is likely that the efficacy of  the pioglitazone + metformin combination would be 
maintained after 40 weeks. 
Supportive studies 
An open trial was performed in combination with voglibose (alpha glucosidase inhibitor). The trial 
results contribute to the safety database.  
Subsequent applications 
In a subsequent application (January 2003) the MAH submitted additional data on the use of 
pioglitazone as monotherapy and to increase the maximum daily dose to 45 mg. To support this a 
programme of four long-term studies (Quartet studies) has been conducted by the MAH. The Quartet 
studies have addressed and compared the magnitude and sustainability of the anti-hyperglycaemic 
effect over one year, both in monotherapy and combination therapy using doses of pioglitazone 
between 15 and 45 mg. In monotherapy pioglitazone has been compared with metformin and 
gliclazide. In combination therapy pioglitazone has been compared to the combinations of metformin 
+ SU and metformin + gliclazide .  
The Quartet studies involved 3713 patients, 1857 of which received pioglitazone.  
In monotherapy studies type 2 patients (aged ≥ 35 and ≤ 75yr, C-peptide ≥ 1.5ng/ml) inadequately 
controlled by diet alone with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11% were included. In combination therapy studies 
type 2 patients (aged ≥ 35 and ≤ 75 years, C-peptide ≥ 1.5ng/ml) inadequately controlled by SU or 
metformin alone respectively were entered into studies. 
15/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
In addition supportive data from a further 1961 patients who received pioglitazone in shorter-term 
studies have been included in the type II variation and line extension applications of January 2003.  
Safety data from exposure on the market was estimated to be over 3 million patients amounting to just 
under 2 million patient years 
Efficacy endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in all trials was the change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint using a 
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) traceable assay at a central laboratory. 
Secondary  endpoints  included fasting  plasma  glucose (FPG) and  fasting insulin. Effects  on the lipid 
profile  were  investigated  by  measuring  triglycerides,  total  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  LDL 
cholesterol (calculated according to the Friedewald formula) and calculating the total cholesterol:HDL 
cholesterol ratio.  
Results 
Pioglitazone  as  monotherapy  was  shown  to  be  statistically  non-inferior  to  both  metformin  and 
gliclazide with respect to HbA1c reduction after one year of treatment. The mean reductions in HbA1c 
and FPG of 1.3-1.5% and 2.0-2.5mmol/l respectively, were maintained to a large degree at 12 months 
with  pioglitazone  and  metformin,  while  gliclazide  showed  some  fall-off.  The  percentage  of  patients 
reaching HbA1c values of ≤7% after one year from a mean baseline of 8.7% was comparable between 
the treatments (pioglitazone: 52-53%, metformin 53%, and gliclazide 47%). The proportion of patients 
showing  response  defined  as  HbA1c reduction  from  baseline >0.6% was also similar,  (pioglitazone: 
79%,  metformin:  78%;  and  gliclazide:  76%).The  mean  change  in  FPG  (2.5mmol/approx)  was 
significantly greater for pioglitazone than for either gliclazide  or metformin  (2.0-2.2mmol/l approx.). 
In  the  analysis  of  the  results  of  the  combination  studies  by  two-sided  t-test,  no  treatment  showed 
superiority  over  the  other.  After  one  year  of  combination  therapy  with  either  metformin  or  SU, 
pioglitazone showed no statistically significant difference with respect to the reduction in HbA1c from 
comparators. 
Gliclazide added to metformin appeared to cause the most substantial loss in glycaemic control during 
the second half of the study.  
The percentage of patients reaching HbA1c values of ≤7% after one year from mean baseline value of 
8.5-8.8%  was  comparable  between  the  treatments  (pioglitazone:  35-39%  (the  higher  value  in 
combination  with  SU)  ,  metformin  40%,  and  gliclazide  35%).  The  proportion  of  patients  showing 
response  (defined  as  HbA1c  reduction  from  baseline  >0.6%)  was  pioglitazone:  67-70%  (the  higher 
value in combination with SU), metformin: 75%; and gliclazide: 63%. 
Pioglitazone in addition to metformin or SU reduced fasting insulin levels. Metformin reduced insulin 
to a lesser extent in both settings, whereas gliclazide increased insulin levels. 
Pioglitazone  as monotherapy or in addition to metformin or SU respectively reduced fasting insulin 
levels.    Metformin  reduced  insulin  to  a  lesser  extent  in  both  settings,  whereas  gliclazide  increased 
insulin levels 
On the basis of the data from the Quartet studies it can be concluded that pioglitazone in doses up to 
45mg whether used as monotherapy or in combination therapy improves glycaemic control in type 2 
diabetes patients with similar efficacy as the currently accepted agents (metformin and SU). The data 
from  the  Quartet  studies  are  satisfactory,  although  until  outcome  study  results  become  available  the 
long-term  benefits  of  therapy  with  pioglitazone  have  not  been  demonstrated.  The  mean  prescribed 
doses  of  pioglitazone  (37-43mg),  metformin    (2124-  2074mg)  and  gliclazide  (198-212mg)  were 
reflective of the doses prescribed clinically. Glucose tolerance testing indicated that piogliazone may 
improve post-prandial glycaemia.  In these patients the reduced post-prandial glucose excursions were 
associated with little change in insulin levels. Pioglitazone also improves the HDL : total cholesterol 
ratio  to  at  least  the  same  extent  as  metformin.    In  addition,  pioglitazone  reduced  the  urinary 
albumin:creatinine ratio by 10-20% in combination therapy.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Pioglitazone  monotherapy  decreased  HbA1C  and  FBG  significantly  as  compared  to  placebo  with 
concomitant reductions in fasting C-peptide and insulin. Triglycerides were reduced. In most studies, 
HDL-cholesterol  increased  (+4  to  11%)  and  LDL-cholesterol  was  either  increased  or  unchanged 
(mean effect +0.2 to 7.8 %). ApoA1 was not measured and HDL/TC ratio was not provided, however 
calculated  HDL/TC  ratios  show  an  increase  of  5-10%  with  pioglitazone.  Blood  pressure  did  not 
change. 
In  combination,  pioglitazone  was  added  to  insulin,  SUs,  and  metformin  respectively,  in  placebo 
controlled studies.  
The  data  from  the  Quartet  studies  are  satisfactory,  although  until  outcome  study  results  become 
available the long-term benefits of therapy with pioglitazone have not been demonstrated. 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 5509  patients took  part in clinical  studies  out  of which  4339 were exposed to  pioglitazone: 
2665  in  European  and  US  trials,  1118  in  Japanese  trials  and  556  in  clinical  pharmacology  studies. 
Doses of 7.5 mg to 60 mg have been administered. At the time of submission, the average duration of 
exposure in European and US studies was 39 weeks. Updated safety data are available for pioglitazone 
+  SU  in  over  600  patients  from  double-  and  single-blind,  placebo-controlled  trials  and  over  400 
patients  in  open  label  trials  of  whom  278  received  the  combination  for  at  least  one  year.  For 
pioglitazone  +  metformin  168  patients  are  available  from  double-blind  placebo-controlled  trials  and 
154 from open label trials of whom 100 received the combination for one year or longer. More than 
152 patients received pioglitazone + sulphonylurea for at least 72 weeks, 96 received pioglitazone + 
metformin  and 199 pioglitazone + insulin. 
Safety  was  assessed  on  the  following  criteria:  vital  signs  and  physical  examination,  body  weight, 
blood  pressure,  and  the  collection  of  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious  AEs,  routine  laboratory  safety 
tests, urine cytology, chest X-ray, ECGs and in some studies echocardiograms. 
Total  exposure  to  pioglitazone  consists  of  about  2600  patient-years  in  the  trials  supporting  the 
monotherapy and 45 mg application (January 2003), 1000 patient-years from the previously submitted 
studies and about 1.8 million patient-years from the market.

Oedema occurred more commonly with pioglitazone than placebo and the investigators considered it 
as  “related”  more  often.  Oedema  appears  to  be  a  dose-dependent  phenomenon  with  pioglitazone. 
Oedema  has  only  rarely  caused  patients  to  withdraw  from  clinical  studies,  and  was  not  related  to 
reporting  of  right  or  left  ventricular  failure,  shortness  of  breath  or  angina,  although  patients  with 
Class III and IV cardiac failure have not been included in these studies. Patients >65 years in general 
had similar adverse events to those younger, and at similar frequency, however peripheral oedema was 
reported  slightly  more  frequently  in  the  elderly  (5.8%  vs.  2.6%).  Peripheral  oedema  was  more 
common in females (5.9%) than in males (1.2%).  
In  combination  trials,  oedema  and  peripheral  oedema  were  increased  in  combination  therapy 
insulin+pioglitazone  (15.6%  vs.  insulin+placebo  7.5%),  in  metformin+pioglitazone  (6.0%  vs.  2.5% 
metformin + placebo) and SU+pioglitazone (7.5% vs. 2.1% SU+ placebo).  
In  the  combination  pioglitazone  +  metformin  study  there  was  no  increased  use  of  diuretics  by 
comparison with metformin and placebo.   
No symptomatic hypoglycaemia (confirmed with measurement of blood glucose) occurred in patients 
receiving pioglitazone alone or placebo. 
Combination  therapy  in  general  showed  a  similar  adverse  event  profile  to  monotherapy.  However, 
sulphonylurea  and  insulin  combination  groups  reported  hypoglycaemia,  in  particular  the  insulin 
combination group (11.6 % vs. 4.8 % in placebo). Metformin combination did not show any increase 
in hypoglycaemia over metformin alone.  
Overall, small decreases in haemoglobin, haematocrit and red cell count have been seen in monotherapy 
and  combination  therapy.  The  changes  are  similar  in  the  long  term  studies.  Changes  in  haemoglobin  
were attributed to haemodilution. 
A higher incidence of myalgias, leg cramps or pain was reported in the pioglitazone groups. Increases 
in LDH (by approximately 10 %) and CPK (by approximately 15 %) compared to placebo were seen 
in monotherapy studies, but not related to clinical signs. Similar LDH and CPK changes are seen in 
combination  therapy,  and  in  the  long-term  studies.  The  changes  were  usually  transient  and 
normalisation occurred despite continuing pioglitazone, and there was no changes observed in relation 
to combined lipid-lowering agents. In placebo-controlled trials changes in CPK were lower in patients 
treated with statins together with pioglitazone than in those treated with pioglitazone alone.  1.1% of 
patients  in  controlled  studies  and  4.2%  in  long  term  studies  had  CPK  > 3ULN  and  were  taking 
18/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
pioglitazone  +  statins  while  1.8%  and  2.8%  respectively  had  CPK  >  3ULN  and  were  taking 
pioglitazone without statins. 
Approximately  the  same  number  of  patients  taking  pioglitazone  as  that  taking  placebo  took  statins 
(11%). Approximately 17% of patients were taking statins in the long-term studies.   
Serious Adverse Events and Deaths 
In double-blind studies in Europe and US 3 % of patients on pioglitazone reported a SAE, compared 
with 4.2% on placebo. These were mainly cardiovascular events.  
In open, long term studies, overall 8.1 % of patients had a SAE (excluding loss of diabetic control). 
These  were  mainly  cardiovascular,  neoplastic  and  musculo-skeletal  in  nature.  There  was  no 
underlying pattern of events. 
On  combination 
the 
metformin + placebo group, in which 1.3% were reported. Again there was no pattern emerging from 
the underlying causes of these SAEs.   
in  4.2-6.1%  of  patients,  except 
therapy,  SAEs  were  reported 
in 
SAEs  judged  attributable  to  study  drug  occurred  in  3  pioglitazone-treated  patients  and  1  placebo-
treated patient in monotherapy studies. 
There  was  3  deaths  in  the  pioglitazone  and  4  in  placebo  group;  there  was  no  indication  of  excess 
mortality for pioglitazone. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Withdrawal rates due  to adverse events were similar in pioglitazone  and  placebo treated groups, the 
global incidence was 8.9 %.  
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events in elderly 
Adverse events  were compared in the  <65 years  old  and  ≥ 65 years  old  patients. No difference  was 
found except for oedema that was  more frequent in  pioglitazone-treated elderly than placebo-treated 
elderly patients. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
• 
Decreases in haemoglobin and anaemia 
Decreases  in  haemoglobin  were  reported,  which  were  attributed  to  fluid  retention  (as  shown  by 
oedema occurrence). The study performed to investigate fat distribution actually showed no change in 
body  water.  However,  no  specific  studies  have  been  performed  to  investigate  the  proposed 
mechanism.  
Oedema 
Oedema  was  one  of  the  most  frequent  adverse  events  reported  with  pioglitazone.  It  was  dose 
dependent  and  occurring  more  frequently  when  pioglitazone  was  used  in  any  of  the  combination 
therapy.  
• 
Cardiac Safety 
Blood pressure did not change appreciably in any of the clinical studies. 
QTc intervals have been measured in many studies, and no changes have been observed in man after 
treatment with pioglitazone. 
In  relation  with  preclinical  findings  and  clinical  findings  (oedema),  there  were  concerns  that 
pioglitazone  might  produce  cardiac  hypertrophy  and  heart  failure  in  diabetic  patients  (at-risk 
population).  Very  few  cases  of  heart  failure  were  reported  in  clinical  trials  or  post  marketing.  No 
statistically  significant  difference  with  the  placebo  group  in  controlled  trials  has  been  found.  In  the 
combination trial of insulin with pioglitazone, more patients in the pioglitazone group took diuretics. 
Echocardiography (M-mode, centrally read) has been used to assess left ventricular mass index (LVMI) 
with pioglitazone (open label PNFP-011). There has been no clinically significant change in LVMI seen

in the programme but the size of the population studied is considered too limited (about 250 patients at 
week 48 with an additional 107 patients at week 108 and 60 at week 132). No functional parameters (for 
early detection of cardiac abnormality) were recorded.

Body Weight 
Pre-clinical studies have shown body weight to increase in animals. 
In  man,  a  detrimental  effect  of  weight  gain  on  the  cardiovascular  system  is  possible  with  a  cycling 
effect resulting in greater obesity. Obese individuals develop cardiovascular disease more frequently 
than  the  non-obese  and  there  is  a  particular  risk  of  ischaemic  heart  disease  in  those  with  a  central 
distribution of obesity. 
In controlled pioglitazone monotherapy studies, a mean weight gain of 1.4 kg and 3.0 kg (in European 
and US trials, respectively) was seen using up to 45 mg pioglitazone. The weight gain was greater when 
pioglitazone was used in combination  with SU or insulin. Weight increase resulted in 7 patients in dose 
ranging  studies  (PNFP-001),  and  2  patients  on  pioglitazone+insulin  combination  discontinuing 
treatment (one patient had a 10-kg weight increase in 21 days, the second mild weight gain with fluid 
retention, both cases were judged possibly related). In long-term studies an increase in weight was seen 
with pioglitazone monotherapy, averaging 5.5 kg over a year. 
To address the question regarding the nature of the weight gain, a European Body Composition Study 
(18- week trial: 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was undertaken. The study indicated that the weight 
gain  following  pioglitazone  HCl  was  composed  of  fat.  There  was  a  significant  decrease  in  intra-
abdominal (visceral) fat while extra-abdominal fat increased. 
The Body Composition Study showed no significant change in total body water and the intravascular 
volume study in healthy volunteers showed no significant fluid accumulation. 
Through  a  type  II  variation  section  5.1  “Pharmacodynamic  properties”  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
Information has been updated to include the results of this study. 
The weight increase has been  shown in a controlled study with pioglitazone and SU to be  primarily 
related  to  increases  in  fat  body  mass  (MRI  study)  with  a  subcutaneous  distribution  rather  than  an 
increase in visceral fat. This study also demonstrated no change in total body water, although clearly 
to explain peripheral oedema and haemoglobin changes some water retention does occur. 
The  mean    increase  in  weight  at  72  weeks  of  treatment    was  approximately  5 kg  for  both  the 
metformin+pioglitazone  30 mg  and  SU+pioglitazone  30 mg  combination.  This  increase  was  at  least 
double  that  noted  at  12-16  weeks  in  the  controlled  studies.  Although  the  weight  gain  seems  to  have 
plateaued  between  24  and  60  weeks,  it  nonetheless  is  a  substantial  weight  gain  in  a  US  population 
whose  mean  baseline  BMI  was  of  the  order  of  32  kg/m2.  The  weight  gain  achieved  in  the  SU  + 
pioglitazone combination studies from Japan was approximately half this amount.  
The need for monitoring weight and controlling diet has been mentioned in the SPC.

Liver toxicity 
There was a particular concern with liver toxicity as another thiazolidinedione has been associated with 
serious liver toxicity. 
No liver toxicity from pioglitazone was seen in the toxicology studies.  
In monotherapy studies fewer patients developed liver function tests ≥3ULN with pioglitazone than on 
placebo. No patient developed liver function tests ≥10ULN.    
In the long-term studies, one patient had a markedly abnormal bilirubin, and subsequently died from 
cholangiocarcinoma.  One  further  patient  had  abnormal  liver  tests  at  baseline,  but  this  returned  to 
normal on treatment with pioglitazone. 
In  the  combination  studies,  there  are  ten  reports  of  markedly  abnormal  liver  tests  (>3ULN)  on 
pioglitazone  (nine  of  which  were  in  combination  with  insulin),  and  12  instances  on  placebo  with 
concomitant anti-diabetic therapy (four of these were on insulin). 
There  is  a  0.4%  reporting  rate  for  liver  and  hepatobiliary  adverse  events  on  both  pioglitazone  and 
placebo. Of  those  patients who  had abnormal liver  function,  many had  other  hepatobiliary disorders 
such as cholecystitis or pancreatic malignancy.  
20/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
In controlled monotherapy studies three hepatobiliary serious adverse events were seen. Of the two on 
pioglitazone,  one  had  cholelithiasis  and  the  other  had  carcinoma  of  the  pancreas.  There  were  three 
serious  adverse  events  on  long  term,  open  label  treatment  also  related  to  cholelithiasis  (two)  and 
cholecystitis (one). A further patient had a cholangiocarcinoma categorised. 
There were five hepatobiliary serious adverse events in combination studies, all on pioglitazone, and 
these all related to cholelithiasis or gall bladder disorder. There were no product-related deaths from 
hepatobiliary disease.  
• 
Urine cytology 
Follow up of patients (including urine cytology and if positive appropriate further investigations) from 
the controlled US and the Japanese studies did not reveal any bladder malignancies.  
• 
Colon cancer 
No signal of an increased risk of malignancy has been detected in clinical trials with pioglitazone. It 
has been shown that PPAR-γ is expressed in tumour cell lines, and that troglitazone and rosiglitazone 
may  promote  colon  tumours  in  transgenic  mice.  No  increases  in  colon  tumours  were  seen  in  rat  or 
mouse carcinogenicity studies with pioglitazone.  
There is a concern with the use of thiazolidinediones in patients with an increased risk of colon cancer 
(e.g., familial colon polyposis). This concern is addressed in the Preclinical Safety Data section of the 
SPC. 
The post-hoc analysis of safety (and efficacy) results in the subset of diabetic population where there 
might  be  an  unmet  medical  need,  i.e.,  the  patients  insufficiently  controlled  on  SU  but  who  cannot 
tolerate  metformin (this  analysis was  requested by  the  CPMP)  did  not reveal  specific  concerns. The 
safety profile in this subset of patients was comparable to that of the overall population. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence from clinical studies of pioglitazone causing liver dysfunction. Although oedema 
occurred in a significant number of patients, no cardiovascular safety signal was identified in the short 
term.  In  the  long  term,  there  are  insufficient  numbers  of  patients  to  fully  assess  the  potential 
cardiovascular risks in this population. This would need to be further investigated in clinical trials with 
both efficacy and safety endpoints. The occurrence of substantial weight gain is a cause for concern 
particularly in a population where obesity is so prevalent.  
The  Quartet  studies  demonstrated  that  pioglitazone  in  doses  up  to  45  mg  in  monotherapy  and  in 
combination  therapy  did  not  reveal  new  or  unexpected  adverse  events.  However  CPMP  noted  that 
these  studies  are  efficacy  studies  .  They  can  be  supportive  for  the  safety  of  pioglitazone  but  cannot 
provide  conclusive  evidence  of  safety.  Therefore  there  is  still  a  need  to  have  more  data  from  post-
marketing studies with regards to the cardiovascular safety profile of pioglitazone.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The pharmaceutical documentation showed the quality of the product was acceptable. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Pioglitazone  is  a  thiazolidinedione  compound  acting  as  a  PPARγ  agonist  to  reduce  hyperglycaemia 
and possibly insulin resistance. 
Pioglitazone  has  been  shown  to  be  devoid  of  genotoxic  potential  in  a  standard  battery  of  tests. 
Pioglitazone was  not carcinogenic in  mice. A safety concern was identified in rat preclinical studies 
where bladder hyperplasia were observed in both sexes, and tumours in males only at plasma levels 
close  to  human  exposure.  A  case  control  study  will  be  performed  investigating  this  issue  post 
marketing. 
Efficacy 
Pioglitazone has been shown to cause a statistically and clinically significant reduction in HbA1c and 
glucose  (FBG  and  post-prandial  AUC)  in  doses  of  15-45  mg  in  patients  with  type2  diabetes. 
21/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
Simultaneously there has been a reduction in fasting insulin, a decrease in triglycerides and a rise in 
HDL and inconsistent though mainly non-significant versus placebo changes in LDL.  
Monotherapy 
The  clinical  efficacy  of  pioglitazone  in  monotherapy  was  considered  insufficiently  documented  as 
compared to available anti-diabetic medicinal products, i.e., sulphonylureas. There was no comparison 
with  metformin,  which  is  an  insulin  sensitiser.  The  population  included  in  the  trials  was 
heterogeneous, including both naive and previously treated diabetic patients, and patients with a wide 
range of BMI. The duration of controlled trials was considered too short for a full efficacy and safety 
assessment,  especially  in  the  context  of  chronic  use  as  expected  in  diabetes.  Long-term  open  trials 
were not controlled.  
Combination therapy 
The  clinical  efficacy  of  pioglitazone  in  combination  with  other  anti-diabetic  medicinal  products  has 
not been compared to the widely-used sulphonylurea+metformin combination.  
In combination with metformin, short-term efficacy data with pioglitazone are considered sufficient in 
obese patients not controlled on metformin alone. No long term trials are currently available for safety 
and efficacy, which in the context of a chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes is not sufficient.  
As for monotherapy, the duration of trials was limited and considered insufficient for long-term use of 
the product.  
The  Quartet  studies  were  undertaken  to  address  the  above  concerns  with  regard  to  the  monotherapy 
and  combination  therapy  use  of  pioglitazone.  The  new  data  of  the  Quartet  studies  offers  some 
reassurance, however the long-term benefits of therapy with pioglitazone have not yet been confirmed. 
However,  in  clinical  practice,  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  in  a  subset  of  patients  in  whom 
metformin  is  not  tolerated  or  contraindicated.  In  this  subset  of  patients,  pioglitazone  (15-45  mg)  in 
combination  with sulphonylureas  may retain  some  benefits  and  the analysis of available  data in this 
population shows that the efficacy is similar to that of the overall studied population. 
Safety 
The  major  clinical  safety  issues  discussed  by  the  CPMP  during  the  assessment  were  liver  toxicity, 
weight gain, and potential cardiac toxicity in relation to oedema. It was accepted that there is no signal 
for liver toxicity of pioglitazone in clinical trials.  
Weight  gain  has  been  noted  with  pioglitazone  monotherapy  as  well  as  combination  therapy  with 
insulin and SU, but not with metformin; weight gain is a concern in this often obese population.  
At the time of the assessment, there were no long-term data available on potentially deleterious effects 
on cardiovascular disease, heart function, and insulin resistance. Long-term echocardiography data are 
only  available  in  a  limited  subgroup  of  patients  and  long-term  controlled  clinical  trials  including 
cardiovascular  safety  endpoints  were  lacking  in  a  population  at  high  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease. 
The absence of negative effects on blood pressure was considered as reassuring.  
Due to the absence of long-term data, the overall effect of pioglitazone on cardiovascular risk cannot 
be assessed. 
The studies included in the monotherapy and 45 mg applications (January 2003) did not reveal new or 
unexpected  adverse  events.  The  section  4.8  “Undesirable  effects”  of  the  SPC  has  been  updated  to 
reflect the adverse events related to the use of pioglitazone as monotherapy. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  pioglitazone  as  monotherapy  were  not  considered  to  be  sufficiently 
demonstrated  in  the  absence  of  a  comparison  with  available  reference  treatments  and  long  term 
controlled  efficacy  and  safety  data.  The  use  of  pioglitazone  in  patients  with  secondary  failure  with 
SUs has not been directly studied in the dossier and such an indication would need to be supported by 
specific efficacy and safety data. 
The efficacy and safety of pioglitazone in combination with either insulin or sulphonylureas were not 
considered as sufficiently demonstrated in absence of long term controlled efficacy and safety data. In 
22/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
particular, the pioglitazone-induced adverse effects such as weight gain and oedema were considered 
unacceptable.  This  has  been  addressed  in  the  SPC  by  adding  a  contraindication  to  the  use  of 
pioglitazone in combination with insulin.  
In addition, the CPMP recognised that there was no cardiovascular safety signal identified in the short 
term. However, the data provided were insufficient to provide reassurance on the long term, especially 
concerning the occurrence of heart failure in patients with NYHA I or II.  
The  CPMP  considered  that  the  current  efficacy  and  safety  data  on  the  use  of  pioglitazone  in 
combination with SUs were only acceptable in the population where there is an unmet medical need. 
Among the patients insufficiently controlled on monotherapy with one of the currently approved oral 
antidiabetics, there is a subgroup of patients for whom the metformin+sulphonylurea combination is 
not an option. Currently the available therapy for these patients would be insulin, and insulin therapy 
is  associated  with  practical  problems  in  elderly  patients  as  well  as  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia. 
Therefore, the use of pioglitazone (15-30 mg) can be recommended for specific subgroups of patients 
for whom an unmet  medical need is described, especially those with insulin resistance. Specifically, 
on request from the CPMP, data were submitted to support the use of pioglitazone in combination with 
a  sulphonylurea  in  patients  who  are  not  satisfactorily  controlled  upon  monotherapy  and  show 
gastrointestinal intolerance to metformin or in whom metformin is contraindicated. Furthermore, data 
were  submitted  to  support  the  use  of  pioglitazone  in  combination  with  metformin  in  obese  patients 
who are not satisfactorily controlled upon metformin monotherapy. In discussing the timing of studies 
to  address  the  potential  cardiovascular  risk,  some  CPMP  members  maintained  that  further  safety 
studies should be performed prior to the marketing authorisation. However, the majority of the CPMP 
considered  that,  as  the  indication  for  pioglitazone  has  been  restricted  to  patients  with  an  unmet 
medical need, these studies could be undertaken as a post-marketing commitment. The Applicant has 
committed to perform adequate post-marketing studies to address the open safety issues. These studies 
will investigate the progression of CHF in type 2 diabetes patients treated with pioglitazone, and long-
term  effects  of  pioglitazone  on  lipids,  and  will  compare  combined  therapy  with  pioglitazone  to  a 
combination of other anti-diabetic agents. In addition, further safety data will be collected from a case 
control study, and prescription event monitoring. 
Based  on  data  from  the  quartet  studies,  the  CPMP recommended  the  increase  of  the  approved  daily 
dose of pioglitazone to 45 mg. 
The  data  from  the  application  to  support  the  use  of  pioglitazone  in  monotherapy  were  satisfactory. 
However the CPMP considered that there are still unresolved concerns regarding long-term safety data 
for  pioglitazone  and  lack  of  outcome  data  with  thiazolidinediones.  Therefore  the  CPMP  was  of  the 
opinion  that  the  monotherapy  indication  for  pioglitazone  should  respect  the  first-line  status  of 
metformin,  clearly  indicating  that  pioglitazone  is  an  alternative  for  patients  for  whom  metformin 
would  otherwise  be  the  first  alternative.  The  CPMP  was  also  of  the  opinion  that  the  use  of 
pioglitazone  in  monotherapy  should  be  restricted  by  using  a  weight  qualification.  The  CPMP 
recommended the second-line monotherapy indication. 
In  order  to  harmonise  the  indication  for  combination  therapy  with  the  monotherapy  indication,  the 
weight qualification was subsequently amended from obese to overweight patients. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk  profile  of  Actos  was  favourable  for  a  restricted  indication:  “only  in  oral  combination 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal 
tolerated doses of oral monotherapy with either metformin or a sulphonylurea: 
- 
- 
in combination with metformin only in obese patients, 
in combination with a sulphonylurea only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for 
whom metformin is contraindicated”. 
23/24 
EMEA 2004 
 
Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk profile of Actos was favourable in the following therapeutic indications: 
“as oral monotherapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly  overweight patients, 
inadequately controlled by diet and exercise  for whom metformin is inappropriate because of 
contraindications or intolerance. 
Pioglitazone is also indicated for oral combination treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with 
insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of oral monotherapy with either 
metformin or sulphonylurea: 
- 
- 
in combination with metformin particularly in overweight patients 
in combination with a sulphonylurea only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for 
whom metformin is contraindicated”

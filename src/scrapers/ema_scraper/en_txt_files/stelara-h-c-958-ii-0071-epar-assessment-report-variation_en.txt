The European Commission granted the first marketing authorisation (MA) for Stelara in 2009 for the 
treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who have failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or who are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, 
methotrexate and psoralen plus ultra-violet A light [PUVA]).  Subsequently, indications were added for 
the treatment of plaque psoriasis in both adult and paediatric populations.  Most recently (2016) Stelara 
was approved the for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease

who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a TNFα antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies. 
The new indication applied for proposes to extend the indication for Stelara to include treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, 
lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic or have medical 
contraindications to such therapies.  
UC is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of the colon characterised by alternating episodes of 
remission and spontaneous relapse. The prevalence has been estimated to range from 38 to 249 cases 
per 100,000 persons in North America and 5 to 505 cases per 100,000 persons in Europe. It is most 
commonly diagnosed in late adolescence and early adulthood, with the peak incidence occurring between 
20 to 39 years of age. 
The precise pathogenesis of UC is presently unknown; however, the prevailing paradigm is dysregulation 
of the enteric immune response in genetically susceptible individuals.  This leads to upregulation of 
macrophages and type-2 T helper (Th2) lymphocytes in UC, as a result of inability to appropriately 
downregulate both innate and adaptive immune responses to endogenous luminal antigens. This 
produces an excess of cytokines, interleukins (ILs) and chemokines, all of which can lead to enhanced 
inflammation and tissue damage. Evidence has shown that upregulation of some of the common gamma 
chain cytokines may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), of which the 2 
main forms are UC and Crohn’s disease. Unlike CD, only the colon and rectum are affected in UC and not 
the entire GI tract. It can be classified into extensive, left-sided colitis and proctitis. There are 
pathophysiological similarities between UC and CD colitis and UC and Crohn’s disease patients and about 
20% have indeterminate colitis at the time of diagnosis. 
The hallmark clinical presentations for UC include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, passage of mucus, 
tenesmus, urgency, and abdominal pain. Patients may also experience fatigue, fevers, weight loss, and 
dehydration, particularly in more severe cases. Mortality is not increased in UC in general, but UC causes 
significant morbidity and the disease may present as life-threatening fulminant colitis. Most patients 
follow a chronic intermittent course with periods of increased disease activity separated by periods of 
disease remission. After the initial diagnosis, approximately half of patients will have active disease at any 
single point in time and approximately 90% will have a disease course characterized by intermittent 
flares. Although the incidence is decreasing, patients with UC have an increased risk of developing 
colorectal cancer due to the development of dysplasia in the setting of chronic mucosal inflammation. The 
surgical option for refractory UC is a proctocolectomy. Intestinal continuity can be restored with am ileal 
pouch-anal anastamosis but this procedure is associated with considerable morbidity.  
The goal of UC medical treatment in general is the induction and maintenance of disease remission in 
order to provide an improved quality of life, reduction in the need for long-term corticosteroids, reduction 
in the need for colectomy and minimization of cancer risk. Conventional therapies for the treatment of UC 
include mesalamine, glucocorticoids, and thiopurines.  Approved systemic therapies for the treatment of 
UC include anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agents such as golimumab, infliximab, and 
adalimumab, the α4β7 integrin antagonist vedolizumab, and most recently the Janus kinase inhibitor 
tofacitinib. These agents are currently available for the treatment of patients with UC who have had 
inadequate response or were intolerant to conventional therapy. Vedolizumab and tofacitinib are the only 
approved products of that group that do not target TNFα and the only products that have demonstrated 
efficacy in patients who have had an inadequate response to (ie, primary non-response or secondary loss 
of response) or are intolerant of anti-TNFs. Systemic treatments are administered either intravenously 
(IV; infliximab and vedolizumab), subcutaneously (SC; golimumab and adalimumab), or orally 
(tofacitinib). Despite the availability of these approved therapies, not all patients respond to induction

therapy (ie, primary non-response). In addition, many patients who initially respond to the approved 
therapies may lose response over time (secondary loss of response).   
At present, no current pharmacological therapy is able to provide a cure for UC. While it appears to be 
decreasing, the long term colectomy rate is 15-20%. The primary treatment goal is to induce remission 
and then to maintain this state. 
Ustekinumab is classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System 
as an Interleukin Inhibitor (ATC code: L04AC05). Ustekinumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) that binds with high affinity and specificity to the p40 subunit common to both human interleukin 
(IL)-12 and human IL-23. 
Ustekinumab prevents IL-12 and IL-23 bioactivity by preventing their interaction with their cell surface 
IL-12Rβ1 receptor protein. Through this mechanism of action, ustekinumab effectively neutralizes IL-12 
(Th1)- and IL-23 (Th17)-mediated cellular responses. Abnormal regulation of IL-12 and IL-23 has been 
associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease [IBD; e.g., 
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD)]. 
Ustekinumab represents a new mechanism of action for the treatment of UC and has been approved in 
the related indication of CD. 
Based on pathophysiologic similarities between UC and CD, the commonality of medications used to treat 
UC and CD and the positive clinical results for ustekinumab in the treatment of Crohn’s disease, a 
direct-to-phase 3 program was developed for the study of ustekinumab in the treatment of UC using the 
same induction and maintenance dose regimens as those used in the CD Phase 3 clinical program.  
The UC and CD programs also employed a similar design strategy of placebo-controlled induction and 
randomised-withdrawal maintenance Phase 3 studies and had similar target populations (ie, biologic and 
conventional therapy failure subjects). The proposed ustekinumab treatment regimen is the same as is 
authorised for CD; an initial single IV induction dose followed by SC administration every 8 or 12 weeks 
during maintenance.

Tabular Overview of Phase 3 Studies in the Ulcerative Colitis Development Program for 
Ustekinumab 
The pivotal development program consists of two Phase 3 studies, an IV induction study and an SC 
maintenance study, which were conducted under a single protocol (UCO3001) but were designed and 
analysed as two separate studies with separate endpoints and Type I error control. The induction study 
randomized adult subjects with moderately to severely active UC who had demonstrated an inadequate 
response to or failure to tolerate conventional or biologic therapy. The maintenance study was a 
randomized-withdrawal study targeting subjects with moderately to severely active UC who had 
demonstrated a clinical response to induction treatment with IV ustekinumab. 
The MAH have submitted PK data for serum concentration, exposure-response analysis and Population PK 
based on the pivotal phase 3 induction and maintenance study UCO3001. A list of the studies included in 
the ustekinumab development program in UC and supporting studies for Crohn’s disease is presented 
below. As mentioned in the introduction, based on pathophysiologic similarities between UC and CD, CD 
studies are considered to provide supportive information.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacology of Ustekinumab was described in the original application in 2009. Relevant to the 
formulation and dosing in this extension variation into UC, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
immunogenicity of ustekinumab following intravenous (IV) and/or subcutaneous (SC) administration 
were evaluated in 2 Phase II (C0379T07, C0743T26) and 3 Phase III (CNTO1275CRD3001 [CRD3001], 
CNTO1275CRD3002 [CRD3002], CNTO1275CRD3003 [CRD3003]) clinical studies in subjects with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease.  
A population PK analysis and exposure-response analysis with respect to efficacy and safety, using 
combined data from C0743T26, CRD3001, CRD3002 and CRD3003 has been performed. 
The company have submitted PK data for serum concentration, exposure-response analysis and 
Population PK based on the pivotal phase 3 induction and maintenance study UCO3001. 
Validated bioanalytical methods were used. Validation reports were provided. They were considered 
acceptable by CHMP.

Serum Ustekinumab concentrations over time 
Induction 
Following a single IV administration of the 130 mg ustekinumab fixed dose (which approximates 2 mg/kg 
dose) or ~6 mg/kg ustekinumab at induction Week 0, median serum ustekinumab concentrations were 
approximately dose proportional and were detectable at all sampling time points through induction Week 
8. Median peak serum ustekinumab concentrations 1 hour after the induction Week 0 infusion were 43.16 
μg/mL (mean±SD: 43.8±9.2 μg/mL) and 127.0 μg/mL (mean±SD: 129.1±27.6 μg/mL) for the 130 mg 
and ~6 mg/kg groups, respectively. At induction Week 8, median serum ustekinumab concentrations 
were 2.51 μg/mL and 8.59 μg/mL for the 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg groups, respectively 
Maintenance 
Subjects randomized to ustekinumab 90 mg q8w or 90 mg q12w had sustained ustekinumab serum 
concentrations through maintenance Week 44, while in those subjects randomized to placebo, median 
ustekinumab serum concentrations were below the lowest quantifiable concentration by maintenance 
Week 16

Maintenance Study; Randomized Subjects

Steady-state trough ustekinumab concentrations in subjects who received ustekinumab 90 mg q8w were 
approximately 3-fold the concentrations in subjects who received ustekinumab 90 mg q12w. For 
example, at maintenance Week 24, the only concurrent preadministration time point during maintenance 
for both ustekinumab randomized maintenance treatment groups, the median trough serum 
ustekinumab concentration was 2.74 μg/mL in the ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group and 0.92 μg/mL in the 
ustekinumab 90 mg q12w group 
The impact of the different IV induction doses on the serum ustekinumab concentrations during 
maintenance continued to diminish over time. In subjects randomized to placebo maintenance, median 
serum ustekinumab concentration declined below the lowest quantifiable concentration at maintenance

Week 12 in subjects who had received ustekinumab 130 mg IV induction, or at maintenance Week 20 in 
subjects who had received ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV induction. 
Serum Ustekinumab concentrations and body-weight categories 
In general, following the fixed 90 mg SC ustekinumab administration, median serum trough ustekinumab 
concentrations tended to be lower in subjects with higher body weight. For example, at Week 24 in the 
ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group, median serum ustekinumab concentration in the upper 2 quartile 
subgroups were 2.39 µg/mL and 2.11 µg/mL respectively, compared with 3.45 µg/mL and 3.49 µg/mL in 
the lower 2 quartile subgroups (Table 2). 
Similarly, at Week 24 in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w group, median serum ustekinumab concentrations 
in the upper 2 quartile subgroups were 0.78 µg/mL and 0.85 µg/mL respectively, compared with 1.18 
µg/mL and 1.46 µg/mL in the lower 2 quartile subgroups, respectively (Table 2). 
Despite these trends, there was no notable impact of body weight on efficacy

Effect of Immunomodulator use and biological failure status on serum Ustekinumab 
concentrations 
There was no discernible impact of immunomodulators on serum ustekinumab concentrations. In the 
UCO3001 induction and maintenance studies, median serum ustekinumab concentrations in their 
respective treatment groups were similar between subjects who were receiving immunomodulators 
compared with those who were not receiving immunomodulators. 
Serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects with UC were evaluated by biologic failure status in the 
UCO3001 maintenance study. By their respective SC maintenance doses, median serum concentrations 
over time were generally comparable between subjects who had previously failed biologics and those who 
had not failed biologics 
Comparison of ustekinumb concentrations in UC and Crohn’s studies 
Following the same IV induction dose, ustekinumab peak concentrations were similar between subjects 
with UC (UCO3001 induction) and Crohn’s disease (pooled CRD3001 and CRD3002 studies). At 1-hour 
postinfusion Week 0, median serum ustekinumab concentration in subjects with UC were 43.16 μg/mL 
and 127.0 μg/mL following a single IV infusion of ustekinumab 130 mg or ~6 mg/kg, respectively. In 
comparison, the corresponding data in subjects with Crohn’s disease were 41.9 μg/mL and 126.1 μg/mL, 
respectively. At induction Week 8, the time of the primary efficacy endpoint in the UC and Crohn's disease 
studies, median serum ustekinumab concentration in subjects with UC were 2.51 μg/mL and 8.59 μg/mL 
following a single IV infusion of ustekinumab 130 mg or ~6 mg/kg, respectively. In comparison, the 
corresponding concentration data in subjects with Crohn’s disease were slightly lower at 2.09 μg/mL and 
6.36 μg/mL

Following the same SC maintenance dose regimens, ustekinumab concentrations appeared slightly 
higher in subjects with UC compared with Crohn’s disease. For example, at Week 24, median serum 
ustekinumab concentrations were 0.92 µg/mL and 2.74 µg/mL in subjects with UC in the SC ustekinumab 
90 mg q12w and 90 mg q8w groups, respectively. The corresponding concentrations among subjects 
with Crohn’s disease were 0.62 µg/mL and 2.11 µg/mL, respectively. 
No notable difference in demographic characteristics or known covariates of ustekinumab PK between 
subjects with UC and Crohn’s disease could account for this apparent difference in trough ustekinumab 
concentrations; however, the magnitude of the difference is not unusual considering the PK variability 
involved in cross-study comparisons for biological products.  
Neutralising antibodies 
In the UCO3001 induction study, of the 4 treated subjects with UC who were positive for antibodies to 
ustekinumab through induction Week 8 in the UCO3001 induction study, 2 subjects were positive for 
Nabs 
In the UCO3001 maintenance study, of the 39 treated subjects with UC who were positive for antibodies 
to ustekinumab through maintenance Week 44 of treatment with ustekinumab, 11 (28.2%) were positive 
for NAbs equating an overall incidence of 1.6% for Nabs 
Of the 635 ustekinumab-treated subjects with appropriate samples through Week 8 in the UCO3001 
induction study, 4 subjects (0.6%) were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab from Week 0 through 
Week 8. 
Among 523 randomized subjects with appropriate samples in the UCO3001 maintenance study, the 
incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was similar in subjects on 90 mg q12w (3.5%) and 90 mg q8w 
(3.4%) but higher among those receiving placebo after a single ustekinumab IV induction (9.1%). 
Because of the limited number of subjects (N=28) who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab at any 
time during maintenance through Week 44 in the randomized population, these results should be 
interpreted with caution. 
Population PK analysis 
Objectives 
To develop a population PK model to characterize the PK of ustekinumab in adult subject with UC 
following intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of ustekinumab. 
To identify and quantify the effect of covariates which significantly influence ustekinumab PK in 
adult subjects with UC. 
To evaluate the necessity of covariate-based dose adjustment of ustekinumab in adult subjects 
with UC. 
To provide ustekinumab exposure metrics to facilitate further modeling analysis such as 
exposure-response analysis of ustekinumab in adult subjects with UC.

Data 
The population PK analysis was performed using data from subjects enrolled in the clinical development 
program for ustekinumab in UC which consisted of 1 induction study and 1 maintenance study, conducted 
under a single protocol (CNTO1275UCO3001). Both studies were Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies of ustekinumab in subjects with moderately to 
severely active UC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 18/161 
 
 
 
Data handling 
Fifty-five (55) serum ustekinumab concentration records from 27 subjects were removed from the 
analysis due to incorrect/incomplete sampling/dosing time, as pre-specified in the Analysis Plan. 
All concentration records prior to the first ustekinumab dose were excluded from the analysis. These 
included 48 samples above the limit of quantification, and 1502 samples below the limit of quantification 
(BLQ). 
Of the remaining 10,399 post-dose serum ustekinumab concentrations, 1364 samples (13.1%) were 
BLQ. These samples were excluded from the population PK analysis. Of note, approximately 80% (1162 
out of 1364) of these samples came from subjects who received ustekinumab IV induction but were 
randomized to the placebo maintenance treatment. Therefore, the serum concentration values from 
these subjects are expected to be BLQ for a substantial portion of the maintenance study. Nevertheless, 
to avoid bias in the model parameter estimates as a result of excluding the censored BLQ data, a 
sensitivity analysis was conducted using the M3 approach1 in NONMEM for the final PK model, per the 
Analysis Plan. 
21 post-dose ustekinumab concentration records from 12 subjects were excluded as outliers. 
The final dataset included a total of 9,014 serum ustekinumab concentrations from 823 subjects with UC. 
Methods 
The population PK analysis was performed using NONMEM (version 7.4.1). The first-order conditional 
estimation with interaction (FOCE-I) method was employed for all model runs. 
The population PK analysis involved the development of a base model and a covariate model. The effects 
of body weight were included a priori on the clearance and volumes of distribution parameters in the base 
model. The covariate model development used a full-model approach with backward elimination (nominal 
p<0.001). Covariates assessed in the popPK analysis are provided in Table 4. The final model was 
obtained by removing covariates with effect sizes less than 10% of the typical values of the respective PK 
parameter from the full covariate model. This reduced model was regarded as the final population PK 
model which was subsequently used for PK simulations and exposure-response modelling.

Results 
Base model 
A 2-compartment linear model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination was selected with 
IIV on CL, V2, V3, first-order absorption rate constant (Ka), and SC bioavailability (F1). Additionally, 
correlation terms were included between CL, V2 and V3 (Ω block), and between Ka and F1, respectively. 
The residual error was best described by a combined additive and proportional error model. The effects of 
body weight on V2, CL, Q, and V3 were included in the 2-compartment structural model, in line with the 
Analysis Plan. 
Covariate model 
The impact of the covariates on the respective PK parameters in the full covariate model is illustrated in 
Figure 1.

Final population PK model 
The final population PK parameter estimates along with estimates of the included covariate effects are 
summarized in Table 5. All parameters were reasonably well described with relative standard errors 
(RSEs) less than 20% for all the structural PK and covariate effect parameter estimates with the 
exception of the effect of body weight on Q, which had a RSE of 41.2%. ETA shrinkages of the structural 
PK parameters were low to moderate (4.03% for CL, 17.2% and 18.1% for V2 and V3, respectively, and 
33.5% and 31.6% for Ka and F1, respectively). 
The typical population PK parameter estimates of ustekinumab for CL, Q, V2 and V3 in a UC subject 
weighing 71.2 kg was 0.186 L/day, 0.157 L/day, 3.01 L and 1.43 L, respectively. The typical Ka was 
approximately 0.142 day-1 and the typical subcutaneous F1 was approximately 87.2%. The estimate of 
the terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) derived from the typical population PK parameters was 19.2 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 21/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The covariates in the final PK model included the effects of body weight on V2, V3, Q, CL, and the effects 
of BALB, SEX, and immune response status over time on CL. The potential impact of these factors on 
ustekinumab PK was further assessed by evaluating the PK parameter across a representative range of 
covariate values and compared with the typical population value of the parameter. 
About 5.5% of subjects had antibodies to ustekinumab at any time; however, these subjects were not 
positive for antibodies at every evaluation time point. A total of 119 concentration records (out of 9014, 
1.3%) were associated with positive antibodies to ustekinumab. Using the antibodies to ustekinumab 
over time status to model the effect of antibodies to ustekinumab on CL, a 14% higher CL was predicted 
for subjects with positive antibodies status compared to those with negative antibodies status.

EMA/450688/2019  
Page 22/161 
 
 
 
 
Overall, ustekinumab demonstrated similar PK characteristics in subjects with UC and Crohn’s disease. 
The typical PK parameter estimates, including CL, V2, V3, Ka and F1, were reasonably consistent between 
these 2 disease populations (within 3-25%), with the exception of Q, which was ~ 45% lower in subjects 
with UC compared to those with Crohn’s disease (0.157 versus 0.287 L/day). Model-derived typical 
half-lives were also comparable between subjects with UC and Crohn’s disease (approximately 19 days). 
With respect to factors associated with ustekinumab PK, similar covariates such as body weight, BALB 
level, sex, and antibodies to ustekinumab were found to influence the PK of ustekinumab in both UC and 
Crohn's disease. 
Figure 2 shows the basic goodness-of-fit plots for the final PK model. Overall, there was no apparent bias 
in these goodness-of-fit plots, suggesting that the final model predictions are in good agreement with the 
observed data.

EMA/450688/2019

The results of the sensitivity analysis implementing the M3 approach in NONMEM showed that the major 
PK parameters were similar (within 5% for CL, Q, V2, V3, Ka, and F1) to those in the final PK model; 
however, the condition number was much larger (7.82E+14) for the model with M3 implementation 
indicating an unstable model. These results suggest that there was no appreciable bias in the model 
parameter estimates as a result of excluding the censored BLQ data. 
Model Evaluation/Qualification 
The performance of the final population PK model was evaluated using pcVPC (Figure 3) and VPC with 
stratifications by treatment group (Figure 4) and race (with respect to Japanese population) (data not 
shown). The final PK model adequately captured the median concentration-time profile of ustekinumab as 
well as the associated variabilities, across the treatment groups and race (with respect to Japanese 
population).

Pharmacokinetic Simulations 
The final population PK model was used to simulate 5000 ustekinumab concentration-time profiles 
following the dose regimens evaluated in the induction and maintenance UC studies and to compute the 
systemic exposure metrics during the induction and maintenance therapy, respectively. Subject level 
immune response IIRP was used in the simulation to capture the effects of antibodies to ustekinumab on 
ustekinumab PK. 
Figure 5 shows the simulated median ustekinumab serum concentration-time profile following IV 
ustekinumab induction treatment at Week 0 and SC ustekinumab maintenance treatment from Week 8 
and beyond. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the predicted ustekinumab PK metrics during the induction and 
maintenance studies, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 5, steady-state of serum ustekinumab concentrations for the maintenance study 
would be achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose following ustekinumab induction and 
maintenance treatment. With respect to maintenance, subjects with lower body weights tended to have 
higher serum steady-state ustekinumab exposures (Css,trough and Css,ave) (Figure 7). Simulations also 
suggest that the steady-state exposures would be similar among subjects who received different 
induction doses but had the same maintenance dose regimen.

Predicted effects of dose adjustment on steady-state trough concentrations for subjects who experience 
loss of clinical response 
Figure 8 shows the predicted ustekinumab steady-state trough concentrations for subjects who received 
the 90 mg SC q12w maintenance regimen and had a loss of clinical response during the maintenance 
study. 
Among subjects who received 90 mg SC q12w, those who experienced loss of response tended to have a 
lower median steady-state serum trough concentration compared to those with a sustained clinical 
response (0.67 μg/mL versus 1.05 μg/mL, respectively; a difference of approximately 36%). If the dose 
regimen for the subjects who experienced loss of response on 90 mg q12w was adjusted to 90 mg SC 
q8w, their model predicted serum trough concentrations would increase about 3-fold from 0.67 μg/mL to 
2.1 μg/mL, which is close to the median ustekinumab concentration observed in those receiving 90 mg 
q8w initially (2.74 μg/mL).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ustekinumab is a fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that binds with specificity to the shared p40 
protein subunit of human cytokines interleukin (IL) 12 and IL 23. Ustekinumab inhibits the bioactivity of 
human IL 12 and IL 23 by preventing p40 from binding to the IL 12Rβ1 receptor protein expressed on the 
surface of immune cells. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response Analysis 
The modeling evaluation of E-R with respect to efficacy was performed using a model-based approach 
with exposure metrics obtained from the population PK analysis of ustekinumab in UC. 
Induction 
The results demonstrate a positive E-R, which implies that subjects who attain higher ustekinumab 
concentrations are more likely to be associated with clinical response at Week 8 than those with lower 
concentrations. Of note, in comparison with the 130 mg group, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
~6 mg/kg group tend to achieve concentrations in the upper portion of the E-R curve associated with the 
highest clinical response rates at induction Week 8.

The solid line curve represents the model-predicted probabilities of achieving clinical response by 
ustekinumab concentration at Week 8. The dark circle symbols represent observed clinical response rate 
in the placebo group (corresponding to zero concentration) and in each ustekinumab concentration 
quartile bin plotted at the median ustekinumab concentration for each bin. The vertical bars on each 
diamond symbol represent the 95% confidence intervals of the observed rates of clinical response based 
on the binomial distribution. The solid line segments at the bottom of the chart show the 5th and 95th 
percentiles of predicted concentrations at Week 8 with the open circles on the line segments plotted at the 
median values, for the 130 mg IV and the ~6 mg/kg doses, respectively. 
Maintenance 
From the maintenance E-R model for clinical remission, remission status at randomization was an 
influential covariate on the intercept parameter. The model implies that subjects who were in clinical 
remission at randomization had a higher probability of being in clinical remission at Week 44 compared 
with those who were not in remission at randomization.  
To assess the goodness-of-fit of the maintenance E-R model, the predicted serum ustekinumab 
concentrations were binned into quartiles and the predicted remission rates were computed for each 
concentration bin. The observed remission rates at maintenance Week 44 were also determined 
according to these bins. The goodness-of-fit plot by remission at randomization status for the 
maintenance E-R model is shown in Figure 13 below, while a comparison between the observed and 
predicted remission rates during maintenance is presented in Table 9 below. The distribution of the 
trough ustekinumab concentrations on the E-R curve suggests that, while the 90 mg q8w regimen may 
more effectively cover the upper portion of E-R curve associated with the highest clinical remission rates 
at maintenance Week 44, the 90 mg q12w regimen may also be effective for certain subjects, especially 
those already in remission following induction treatment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the popPK analyses were conducted adequately. The goodness-of-fit plots did not suggest any 
model misspecifications. There were no apparent trends in the residual plots. The predictive performance 
of the model was demonstrated in the VPCs.  
Body weight was the primary covariate contributing to the observed PK variability of ustekinumab where 
CL, Q, V2 and V3 increased non-linearly with body weight. In addition, subjects with higher baseline 
serum albumin levels had lower CL. Male subjects tended to have 8% higher CL compared to females, and 
the development of antibodies to ustekinumab was associated with a 14% increase in CL. Nevertheless, 
the impacts of these covariates on the respective PK parameters were all within the 0.8 to 1.25 range 
when evaluated across the 25th to 75th percentile of covariate values or categories in the analysis 
dataset. Therefore, none of these covariates were deemed to be clinically significant. 
Ustekinumab demonstrated similar PK characteristics in subjects with UC and Crohn’s disease. With 
respect to factors associated with ustekinumab PK, similar covariates such as body weight, BALB level,

sex, and antibodies to ustekinumab were found to influence the PK of ustekinumab in both UC and Crohn's 
disease. Additionally in Crohn’s disease, clearance was affected by C-reactive protein, TNF antagonist 
failure status and race (Asian versus non-Asian) (5.2 of the SmPC).The PopPK and the serum 
concentration results are generally consistent with the Crohn’s data except for the slightly higher 
concentrations in UC.  
The body weight effect on clearance appears small (~10%) but statistically significant. It is notable that 
bodyweight had no effect on efficacy. However among all the covariates that influence the PK of 
ustekinumab, body weight was the most significant covariate for ustekinumab PK and was adopted in the 
Phase 3 IV induction studies in Crohn’s disease and UC to account for the impact of body weight on 
ustekinumab exposure. It is also noted that selection of the ~6 mg/kg dose was based on the efficacy and 
safety of the ~6 mg/kg dose at Week 8, as well as on results through maintenance in subjects who 
received this dose. Clinical response and the proportion of subjects with a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 
was greater at week 8 for the 6mg/kg and this considered clinically important. The company has also 
demonstrated that subjects who were originally randomized to ~6 mg/kg perform better in maintenance 
than those originally randomized to 130 mg across a range of endpoints with both higher absolute efficacy 
rates and larger differences versus placebo. Therefore the proposed induction dose is agreed. 
Based on currently available data, the development of antibodies to ustekinumab did not have a notable 
impact on clinical efficacy as measured by multiple endpoints such as clinical remission at Week 44, 
clinical response at Week 44, and endoscopic healing at Week 44. Because of the limited number of 
subjects (N=28) who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab at any time during maintenance 
through Week 44 in the randomized population, these results should however be interpreted with caution.  
In other indications such as Crohn’s disease, where impact on efficacy was assessed through 2 years of 
treatment similar efficacy was observed in subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab and 
those who were not. In psoriasis through 5 years of treatment there was some reduced efficacy in 
subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab; however, antibody positivity did not preclude 
a clinical response. With these data, the CHMP does not consider that there are specific reasons for 
concern regarding the impact of immunogenicity on loss of efficacy for ustekinumab. Also it is noted that 
the applicant will continue evaluating the effect of antibodies to ustekinumab on efficacy during the 
CNTO1275UCO3001 long-term extension (which is included in the EU RMP as a category 3 
Post-authorisation Safety Study [PASS]) which is acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No formal dose-ranging was studied for ustekinumab in UC and the dose regimens selected were those 
studied in the Phase 3 program for ustekinumab in subjects with CD.The company submitted PK data for 
serum concentration, exposure-response analysis and PopPK based on the pivotal phase 3 induction and 
maintenance study UCO3001 which is considered acceptable. Pharmacokinetics (PK), exposure-response 
(E-R) relationships, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and biomarker data have been thoroughly 
investigated in the clinical studies (induction + maintenance) to support the UC indication. The PK 
characteristics in subjects with ulcerative colitis were overall comparable to what has previously been 
observed in subjects with Crohn’s disease with no unexpected findings.

Induction Dose Rationale 
Although no formal dose ranging was studied for ustekinumab in UC, dose ranging was performed in a 
Phase 2 study of ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease. The rationale that follows justified the 2 induction 
regimens studied in UC. 
Intravenous administration was chosen for the induction studies in the ustekinumab Crohn’s disease 
program, and subsequently in the UC program, because the evaluation of biomarker changes in response 
to ustekinumab treatment in the Phase 2a ustekinumab study in Crohn’s disease (C0379T07) suggested 
a very rapid onset of action after IV administration that was not observed after SC administration. 
The specific IV doses selected for the Phase 3 induction studies were based on the results of the Phase 2b 
ustekinumab study in Crohn’s disease (C0743T26).  Greater proportions of subjects in the ustekinumab 
1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 6 mg/kg treatment groups were in clinical response at Week 6 (36.6%, 34.1%, 
and 39.7%, respectively) and at Week 8 (32.1%, 31.8%, and 43.5%, respectively) compared with 
placebo (23.5% and 17.4% at Weeks 6 and 8, respectively). However, in the 1 mg/kg group, serum 
ustekinumab concentrations through Week 8 appeared lower in nonresponders at Week 6, a difference 
that was not apparent in the other treatment groups. Subjects in the 1 mg/kg group also appeared to lose 
response earlier than in the 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg treatment groups, suggesting that the 1 mg/kg group 
may not provide sufficient drug exposure to achieve or maintain clinical response through 8 weeks. 
Accordingly, it was determined that a single 6 mg/kg IV dose (which was well tolerated and was the most 
effective induction dose in C0743T26), along with a lower dose (that was higher than 1 mg/kg), would be 
evaluated in the Phase 3 Crohn’s disease studies. In addition, an approach was adopted that allowed the 
use of complete vials, resulting in simpler drug administration. Based on these considerations, a 
ustekinumab 130 mg IV fixed dose (approximately 2 mg/kg on a milligram per kilogram basis) was 
chosen for the low-dose group and weight-range-based doses approximating 6 mg/kg IV (≤55 kg: 260 mg 
ustekinumab; >55-85 kg: 390 mg ustekinumab; >85 kg: 520 mg ustekinumab) were chosen as the 
high-dose group in the Phase 3 Crohn’s disease studies. Given the similarity in the underlying 
inflammatory mechanism of UC and Crohn’s disease and the similar response to available treatments, 
these same doses (ustekinumab 130 mg IV and weight-range-based doses approximating 6 mg/kg IV) 
were chosen for the ustekinumab induction study in UC. 
Maintenance Dose Rationale 
The 2 SC ustekinumab regimens used in the UC maintenance study were also the same as those in the 
Phase 3 maintenance study in the ustekinumab Crohn’s disease program, ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 
weeks (q12w) and 90 mg every 8 weeks (q8w). The ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w regimen was selected 
because it was considered safe and effective in achieving remission among subjects randomized as 
responders to ustekinumab induction in the Phase 2b Crohn’s disease study. To explore a lower dose 
regimen, the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w regimen was included because it was the next lower dose SC 
regimen that had been studied extensively in psoriasis and was considered likely to succeed in 
maintaining clinical efficacy over time in patients with Crohn’s disease. These maintenance doses 
provided systemic exposures that were likely to meet the safety and efficacy objectives for the 
development of ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease and subsequently in UC.

A total of 961 subjects from 244 sites were randomized according to the following regions: 
•  Asia: 13.8% 
• 
Eastern Europe: 38.2% 
•  Rest of World: 48.0% (including North America, Western Europe, Israel, Australia, and New 
Zealand) 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 37/161 
 
 
 
 
Inclusion Criteria 
• 
Eligible subjects were men or women 18 years of age or older with moderately to severely active 
UC, as defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12, inclusive, at Week 0 of the study, including an 
endoscopy subscore ≥2 as assessed during central review of the video of the endoscopy. 
•  Subjects may have been biologic failures, ie, have received treatment with 1 or more TNF 
antagonists or vedolizumab (an integrin receptor antagonist) at a dose approved for the 
treatment of UC, and either did not respond initially, responded initially but then lost response, or 
were intolerant of the medication. A minimum of 40% and a maximum of 50% of the total subject 
population in the induction study were to be biologic failures. 
OR 
•  Subjects may have been biologic-naïve or may have been exposed to biologic therapy but did not 
demonstrate an inadequate response or intolerance to treatment with a biologic agent (ie, a TNF 
antagonist, or vedolizumab). These subjects must have demonstrated an inadequate response 
to, or have failed to tolerate, at least 1 of the following conventional UC therapies: oral or IV 
corticosteroids or the immunomodulators azathioprine (AZA) or6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). 
Subjects who demonstrated corticosteroid dependence (ie, an inability to successfully taper 
corticosteroids without a return of the symptoms of UC) were also eligible for entry into the study. 
All UC-specific medical therapies were to be maintained at stable doses throughout the induction study, 
and could only be discontinued or reduced in dose if in the investigator’s judgment this was required 
because of toxicity or medical necessity. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects who met any of the following criteria were ineligible for entry into the study: 
•  Severe extensive colitis as evidenced by: 
o  Hospitalization for the treatment of UC 
o 
Investigator judgment that the subject was likely to require a colectomy within 
12  weeks of baseline 
o  Symptom complex at screening or baseline visits that included at least 4 of the following: 
  Diarrhoea with ≥6 bowel movements/day with macroscopic blood in stool 
 
 
 
Focal severe or rebound abdominal tenderness 
Persistent fever (≥37.5°C) 
Tachycardia (>90 beats/minute) 
  Anaemia (hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL) 
•  Subjects with UC limited to the rectum only or <20 cm of the colon. 
• 
Presence of a stoma, a fistula, a bowel obstruction, or adenomatous colonic polyps that were not 
removed. 
•  Diagnosis of indeterminate colitis, microscopic colitis, ischemic colitis, or Crohn’s disease, or 
clinical findings suggestive of Crohn’s disease. 
•  A stool culture or other examination that was positive for an enteric pathogen, including 
Assessment report

Page 38/161 
 
 
 
Clostridium difficile toxin, in the previous 4 months, unless a repeat examination was negative and there 
were no signs of ongoing infection with that pathogen. 
Treatments 
The ustekinumab dose regimens selected for the UCO3001 induction and maintenance studies in subjects 
with UC were the same as those that were being studied in the Phase 3 program for ustekinumab in 
subjects with Crohn’s disease. 
The dose regimens studied in the Phase 3 Crohn’s disease program were based on the dose-finding data 
and the efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2 studies of ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease 
The subsequent results from the Phase 3 Crohn’s disease program confirmed that these were appropriate 
doses and are reflected in the approved posology for use in Crohn’s disease. 
All subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (using permuted block randomization stratified by biologic 
failure status [yes or no] and region [Eastern Europe, Asia, or rest of world]) to receive a single IV 
administration of placebo or one of two induction doses of ustekinumab at Week 0 as follows: 
Placebo IV 
Ustekinumab 130 mg IV (130 mg group) 
Weight-range-based dose approximating ustekinumab 6 mg/kg IV (~6 mg/kg group): 
Ustekinumab 260 mg (body weight ≤55 kg) 
Ustekinumab 390 mg (body weight >55 kg but ≤85 kg) 
Ustekinumab 520 mg (body weight >85 kg) 
Subjects who did not achieve a clinical response at Week 8, including subjects who received placebo at 
Week 0, received an additional dose of study agent in a blinded manner at Week 8. Subjects who were in 
clinical response at Week 8 or Week 16 were eligible to enter the maintenance study. Subjects who did 
not enter the maintenance study were to have a safety follow-up visit approximately 20 weeks after the 
last administration of study agent.

Schema for CNTO1275UCO3001 Induction Study 
Treatment of Subjects who were not in Clinical Response at Week 8 in the 
CNTO1275UCO3001 Induction Study 
Subjects were permitted to receive concomitant UC medications (ie, oral 5-aminosalicylates [5-ASAs], 
oral corticosteroids, and immunomodulators [6-MP, AZA, and methotrexate (MTX)]); the dosage was to 
remain stable (including corticosteroids) without initiation or increase throughout the induction study. 
Subjects who initiated or increased the dose of a UC- specific medication (or any restricted/prohibited 
medication) during the induction study were prohibited from entering the maintenance study. 
An interim analysis (IA) was conducted in the induction study to assess futility. This analysis occurred 
when the first 30% of randomized subjects had either completed the induction Week 8 visit or terminated

study participation before Week 8. Based on the criteria defined in the Interim Analysis Plan (IAP), the 
induction study was continued as planned. The IA was conducted by the Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC), and the Applicant remained blinded to treatment assignment.

Terminology of some endpoints used in the UC dossier is different than the terminology proposed to be 
used in the EU Product Information. The proposed terminology for the EU Product Information is in line 
with the terminology used in the EU label of other approved products and/or the UC guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev 1). An overview of the different terminologies is included in Table 10.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
• 
Clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤2 points, with no 
individual subscore >1. 
Major Secondary Endpoints (presented in the order in which they were tested) 
• 
Endoscopic healing at Week 8. Endoscopic healing (ie, improvement in the endoscopic 
appearance of the mucosa) was defined as an endoscopy subscore of the Mayo score of 0 or 1. 
•  Clinical response at Week 8. Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the 
Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding 
subscore ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 
• 
The change from induction baseline in the total score of the IBDQ at Week 8. 
Other Multiplicity-Controlled Endpoint: 
• 
Mucosal healing at Week 8. Mucosal healing was defined as a combination of histologic healing 
and endoscopic healing. Histologic healing, based on features of the Geboes score, was defined as 
neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation 
tissue. 
Efficacy results presented for CNTO1275UCO3001 induction and maintenance studies were based on 
central review of endoscopies.  
Sample size 
Induction study analyses were based on the 961 subjects who were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo 
IV, ustekinumab 130 mg IV, or ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV. 
Efficacy results for the 157 subjects who were ustekinumab induction delayed responders and received 90 
mg q8w in maintenance were not included the primary population or key efficacy analyses 
The sample size in the induction study was based on statistical power considerations and the objective of 
providing the primary population for the maintenance study. 
Sample size/power calculations were based on the chi-square test to detect a significant difference for the 
primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8 between the induction ustekinumab treatment groups 
and placebo. 
It was assumed that the clinical remission rate based on the global definition is 19% for each induction 
ustekinumab treatment group and 7% for the placebo group. These remission rates were similar to those 
from other recently approved therapies in active UC.  The treatment effect was assumed to be the same 
for the 2 induction ustekinumab treatment groups because the data from the Phase 2b study of 
ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease showed similar levels of response across the range of doses studied. 
Assuming a 7% clinical remission (global definition) rate in the placebo group and 19% in each 
ustekinumab group, 135 subjects per treatment group (405 subjects in total) will provide an overall 
power of 90% using a step-up Hochberg procedure at the 0.05 (2-sided) level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 42/161 
 
 
 
 
To provide a sufficient number of subjects for the primary population in the maintenance study, however, 
it was estimated that a target of 951 subjects (317 subjects per treatment group) should be enrolled in 
the induction study. Therefore, enrolment in the induction study was to continue until at least 951 
subjects have been enrolled. The table below show the power for detecting a treatment difference 
between the ustekinumab induction treatment groups and the placebo group based on different 
proportions of subjects in clinical remission at Week 8 for the global definition with a fixed sample size of 
951. 
The applicant argued that a sample size of 951 subjects (317 per treatment group) also provides 
sufficient power for the major secondary endpoints of endoscopic healing at Week 8 and clinical response 
at Week 8. The applicant argued that the given sample size will provide 99% power to detect a 15% 
difference (40% vs 25% for each ustekinumab dose group vs placebo) in endoscopic healing at Week 8 
and to detect a 20% difference (50% vs 30% for each ustekinumab dose group vs placebo) in clinical 
response at Week 8 based on the Hochberg testing procedure at the 0.05 (2-sided) level. The Applicant 
stated that the assumptions noted above are based on the relevant clinical difference observed for other 
biologics in this indication. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to groups, to increase the 
likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g. demographic and baseline characteristics) 
were evenly balanced across all treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons 
across all treatment groups. Blinded treatment was used to reduce potential bias during data collection 
and evaluation of clinical endpoints. 
Central randomisation for treatment allocation was implemented in the induction study. A 
computer-generated randomization schedule was prepared for this study under the supervision of the 
sponsor or delegate. At each call to the interactive web response system (IWRS) for a treatment 
assignment, the IWRS assigned a treatment code that dictated the treatment assignment and matching 
study agent kit for each subject. 
Subjects were randomised to 1 of 3 groups (placebo IV, ustekinumab 130 mg IV, or ustekinumab ~6 
mg/kg IV) at Week 0, using permuted block randomization with biologic failure status (yes/no) and region 
(Eastern Europe, Asia, or rest of world) as stratification variables.

Blinding (masking) 
To maintain the study blind, the study agent container had a label containing the study name, medication 
number, and reference number. A tear-off label was designed to be torn off, separated from the study 
agent container, and attached to the subject's source documents. The label did not identify the study 
agent in the container. The medication number was entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF) 
when the drug was dispensed. The study agents were identical in appearance and packaging. 
The investigator was not provided with randomization codes. The codes were maintained within the 
IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject. 
Data that may have potentially unblinded the treatment assignment (ie, study agent serum 
concentrations, antibodies to study agent) were handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of 
the blind was maintained and the potential for bias was minimized. The post baseline results of CRP, 
faecal lactoferrin, and faecal calprotectin tests performed by the central laboratory were blinded to the 
investigative sites. 
Treatment assignment blinding is to be maintained for investigative sites, site monitors, and subjects 
participating in this study until the Week 44 analyses for the maintenance study are completed. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The Primary Efficacy Analysis Set consisted of all subjects randomized in the induction study. 
Following the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) principle, all subjects were to be analysed according to the 
treatment to which they were assigned regardless of the treatment they actually received. 
Some pre-specified efficacy analyses will also be conducted for the Week 8 Treated Analysis Set, 
which consists of subjects who are not in clinical response at Week 8 as determined by the IWRS and 
receive ustekinumab at Week 8. 
Analysis Methods – Primary endpoint 
The global definition of clinical remission is: A Mayo score ≤2 points, with no individual subscore 
>1. In addition to the clinical remission status based on the Mayo score, treatment failure rules will be 
applied to determine the final clinical remission status for a subject. Subjects who have a protocol-defined 
treatment failure prior to Week 8 will be considered not to be in clinical remission at Week 8, regardless 
of the actual computation of clinical remission based on the Mayo score. Subjects who have all 4 Mayo 
subscores missing at Week 8 will be considered not to be in clinical remission. If 1 or more of the 4 Mayo 
subscores is missing at a specific visit, but not all 4 subscores are missing, the last available value for each 
missing subscore will be carried forward to compute a full Mayo score (where the full mayo score is 
scheduled to be collected). 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission were to be compared between each ustekinumab 
treatment group and the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified 
by biologic failure status (yes or no) and region (Eastern Europe, Asia, or Rest of World).  
Summaries of the proportion of subjects in clinical remission by treatment group, the adjusted treatment 
difference (with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weight) between each ustekinumab treatment group and the 
placebo group, as well as the associated 95% confidence interval were to be provided.

Sensitivity Analyses – Primary endpoint 
The following sensitivity analyses were to be performed to examine the robustness of the primary 
endpoint analysis for the global definition of the primary endpoint: 
Sensitivity Analysis 1 (“modified ITT” analysis): excludes subjects who are randomized but not 
treated. 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 (Observed case): excludes subjects who have missing data at Week 8 and 
have not had an event of treatment failure prior to Week 8. 
For the global definition, subjects with missing data are those who are missing all four Mayo subscores. 
Sensitivity Analysis 3 (LOCF for missing data): For subjects with missing data at Week 8 (as defined 
in Sensitivity Analysis 2), the last available value for each subscore will be carried forward to impute 
missing data. 
Sensitivity Analysis 4 (nonresponder if any missing subscore): subjects with missing data for any 
of the Mayo components pertaining to the primary endpoint (ie, the four Mayo 
subscores for the global definition and the absolute stool number, Mayo rectal bleeding 
subscore, and Mayo endoscopy subscore for the US-specific definition) at Week 8 are considered not to be 
in clinical remission. 
Sensitivity Analysis 5 (per-protocol” analysis): excludes subjects with at least 1 of the following 
deviations that might affect efficacy:  
a.  subject is found to have Crohn's disease instead of UC  
b.  subject is randomized, but does not receive study agent  
c.  subject receives the incorrect study agent or dose at Week 0, or  
d.  subject does not meet major inclusion criteria or does meet major exclusion criteria, or 
has other deviations that will be identified and documented prior to unblinding. 
Sensitivity Analysis 6 (logistic regression): For the global definition, the primary endpoint will be 
analyzed based on a logistic regression with treatment group, baseline Mayo score, biologic failure status, 
and region as covariates. 
Sensitivity Analysis 7 (multiple imputation): This analysis will be based on the multiple imputation 
method which involves the following distinct steps: 
1)  The missing Mayo components pertaining to the primary endpoint (see Sensitivity 
Analysis number 4) at Week 8 will be imputed 5 times to generate 5 complete data sets 
using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, assuming missing at random (MAR) and a 
multivariate normal distribution (since the amount of missing data will be minimal based 
on the past UC induction studies). The following variables will be included in the 
imputation model: Mayo components at Week 0, treatment group, biologic failure status, 
and region. 
2)  Before the multiple imputation method is applied, the Mayo data after treatment failure 
will be set to missing. For each multiple-imputed data set, each subject’s clinical 
remission status at Week 8 will be calculated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 45/161 
 
 
 
3)  Each of the 5 resulting data sets will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with 
treatment group, baseline Mayo score (for global definition) or baseline modified Mayo 
score (for US-specific definition), biologic failure status, and region as covariates. 
4)  The results from the 5 data sets will be combined to produce inferential results. 
Sensitivity Analysis 8 (clinical remission based on local endoscopy subscores): the primary 
analysis will be repeated with clinical remission derived based on local endoscopy subscores, instead of 
the final reported endoscopic subscores. 
Sensitivity Analysis 9 (Worst case): subjects receiving placebo who have missing data at 
Week 8 and have not had an event of treatment failure prior to Week 8 will be considered to be in clinical 
remission, and subjects receiving ustekinumab who have missing data at Week 8 will be considered not 
to be in clinical remission. 
For Sensitivity Analyses 1, 5, 6 and 8 the same missing data rules as are used in the primary analysis 
were also to be applied. Note that treatment failure rules were to override the missing data rules. 
Subjects who had a treatment failure prior to Week 8 were considered not to be in clinical remission at 
Week 8, regardless of the observed or missing data. 
Analysis Methods – Major secondary endpoints 
The major secondary endpoint analyses were to be based on the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set. 
The proportions of subjects with endoscopic healing at Week 8 and the proportions of subjects in clinical 
response at Week 8 were to be compared between each ustekinumab treatment group and the placebo 
group using a 2-sided CMH chi-square test stratified by biologic failure status and region. Summaries of 
the proportion of subjects with endoscopic healing by treatment group and summaries of the proportion 
of subjects in clinical response by treatment group, the adjusted treatment difference (with 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weight) between each ustekinumab treatment group and the placebo group for 
each of these two endpoints, as well as the associated 
95% confidence interval (97.5% confidence interval for the US-specific testing procedure), were to be 
provided. 
For the major secondary endpoint of change from baseline in the IBDQ score at Week 8, the treatment 
groups were to be compared using ANCOVA on the van der Waerden normal scores 
Type I error control – multiple testing procedure 
A Hochberg step-up multiple testing procedure will be employed to control the overall Type 1 error rate at 
the 0.05 level (2-sided) for the primary endpoint (see figure below). For this step-up procedure, if 
p-values for both comparisons (ustekinumab 130 mg treatment group versus placebo group and 
ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg treatment group versus placebo group) are <0.05, then it will be concluded that 
both ustekinumab treatment groups are effective compared with placebo. Otherwise, the smaller of the 2 
p-values will be compared with 0.025; if the smaller p-value is <0.025, then it will be concluded that the 
ustekinumab treatment group associated with the smaller of the 2 p-values is effective compared with 
placebo. 
A positive study is defined as a statistically significant test for at least 1 ustekinumab treatment group 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019

If the primary endpoint of clinical remission (global definition) was not significant for a dose, then all the 
major secondary endpoints for that dose were to be considered not to be significant. Otherwise, a 
hierarchical testing procedure as shown the figure below was to be employed to control the overall Type 
1 error rate over the 3 major secondary endpoints at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level within a dose 
group. A major secondary endpoint for a dose group was to be considered significant only if both the 
previous endpoints in the hierarchy and current endpoint test positive at the 2-sided 0.05 level of 
significance. If an endpoint was not significant, all subsequent tests in the hierarchy were to be 
considered not to be significant. Nominal p-values were to be reported for all analyses. 
Furthermore, mucosal healing at Week 8 will be adjusted for multiplicity. The endpoint of mucosal healing 
at Week 8 will be considered significant only if both the previous endpoints in the hierarchy and this 
mucosal healing endpoint test positive.

Subgroup analyses 
The consistency of treatment effect for the primary endpoint was to be evaluated for subgroups based on 
demographics and baseline UC disease characteristics, baseline UC-related concomitant medication 
usage, and UC-related Medication History (when the number of subjects within each level of the subgroup 
permits). 
For each of these subgroups, the odds ratio of each ustekinumab dose group vs placebo and the 
associated confidence interval (95% for the global definition and 97.5% for the US-specific definition) 
were to be provided. The odds ratios and confidence intervals were to be provided based on the logistic 
regression model that includes factors for treatment group, biologic failure status and region (for the 
subgroup analyses based on biologic failure status or region, the corresponding factor will not be included 
in the model).

Interim Analysis 
A futility analysis based on the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8 was to be conducted when 
30% of randomized subjects had either completed the I-8 visit or have terminated study participation 
before Week 8. The study (including both induction and maintenance) may have been stopped for futility 
when the conditional power on both ustekinumab doses is less than 20%. 
The applicant argued that this futility analysis would result in minimal loss in power (≤2% when the 
treatment effect is in the expected range of 10% to 12%) and would not affect the overall Type I error 
rate (α=0.05, 2-sided) for the primary endpoint analysis; therefore, no alpha was to be allocated for this 
interim analysis for global submission (submission outside the United States). 
The details of the interim analysis were provided in the Interim Analysis Plan (IAP).

Among 961 randomized subjects, 912  (94.9%)  subjects  completed  study participation: 783 (81.5%) 
subjects entered maintenance and 129 (13.4%) subjects who did not enter maintenance completed the 
final safety visit.  
Forty-nine subjects (5.1%) terminated study participation during the study. A total of 20 subjects (2.1%) 
terminated study participation prior to Week 8. The most common reason for termination before Week 8 
was withdrawal of consent which was reported for 14 subjects (1.5%; no subjects in the ~6 mg/kg group, 
5 subjects [1.6%] in the 130 mg group, and 9 subjects [2.8%] in the placebo group). Of the remaining 29 
subjects who terminated study participation, 4 subjects terminated at Week 8 and 25 subjects terminated 
after Week 8.  
Three subjects were unblinded during the study (2 subjects in the ~6 mg/kg group and 1 subject in the 
placebo group). None of these subjects completed the Week 8 visit, however, all 3 subjects completed the 
final safety visit.

Conduct of the study 
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki and that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices and applicable regulatory requirements. 
There were 2 amendments to the protocol, both of which were substantial. The first amendment (14 July 
2015) was implemented before study initiation and incorporated health authority feedback. The second 
amendment (20 April 2016) addressed health authority requests for additional data collection and

Baseline data 
For the induction study, 60.6% of trial subjects were male, 76.0% were white, the median age was 41.0 
years, and the median weight was 71.2 kg. The median duration of disease was approximately 6 years 
and the median Mayo score was 9.0 (84.4% of subjects had moderate UC [ie, Mayo score ≥6 and ≤10] 
and 15.3% had severe disease [Mayo score >10]), 45.7% of subjects had extensive diseaseAmong the 
961 randomized subjects, 51.1% had a documented history of biologic failure (50.5% had failed at least 
one anti-TNF agent and 16.6% had failed both an anti-TNF agent and vedolizumab) and 48.9% did not 
have a history of biologic failure (46.1% were biologic naïve and 2.8% were biologic experienced but were 
not documented biologic failures).  Infliximab, golimumab and adalimumab were the TNF inhibitors that 
subjects were previously exposed to and exposure was similar across the three groups.  Vedolizumab was 
the other biologic that patients may have been exposed to. 
Biologic failures to vedolizumab (regardless of anti-TNF) were 17.3% (Note: 6 subjects were biologic 
failures to only vedolizumab).

Demographic Baseline Data 
More specifically in terms of disease characteristics the results at baseline show that they were generally 
similar across all treatment groups.  At baseline: 
• 
The median duration of disease was 5.97 years 
•  45.7% of subjects had extensive disease 
• 
The median Mayo score was 9.0 
•  84.4% of subjects had moderate UC (ie, a Mayo score ≥6 and ≤10), and 15.3% had severe 
disease (Mayo score >10) 
Baseline median fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin concentrations were higher for subjects in both 
ustekinumab groups (226.9 µg/g and 1506.5 mg/kg, respectively, in the ~6 mg/kg group, and 190.1 
µg/g and 1382.0 mg/kg, respectively, in the 130 mg group) compared with subjects in the placebo group 
(152.0 µg/g and 1224.0 mg/kg, respectively), with the highest concentrations in the ~6 mg/kg group. 
Consistent with this finding, a greater proportion of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg group (74.8%) had an

(67.7%) groups. 
The proportions of subjects who had abnormal levels of inflammatory markers at baseline were similar 
across all treatment groups. The total proportions of subjects who had abnormal levels of inflammatory 
markers among subjects with baseline measurements were as follows: 
•  CRP (>3 mg/L): 59.8% 
• 
• 
Faecal lactoferrin (>7.24 μg/g): 95.9% 
Faecal calprotectin (>250 mg/kg): 89.0%

Summary of Concomitant Medications for UC at baseline: Primary Efficacy Analysis Set 
At baseline, 90.2% of subjects were receiving a concomitant UC medication, with similar proportions of 
subjects across all treatment groups. 
More than half (51.8%) of subjects were using corticosteroids at baseline and 28.2% were using 
immunomodulatory drugs (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX).  The proportion of subjects using aminosalicylates was 
68.7%. 
Numbers analysed 
Missing Data 
For subjects with missing data the last observation was carried forward for continuous endpoints.  An 
exception to this was with the Mayo and partial Mayo scores, where the last available Mayo subscores 
were carried forward.  
For dichotomous endpoints, subjects with missing data were considered not to have achieved the 
respective endpoints. 
Treatment failure rules overrode missing data rules. This meant that if a subject had an event of 
treatment failure, baseline values were assigned from the point of treatment failure onward for 
continuous endpoints, and subjects were not considered to have achieved the respective endpoints for 
dichotomous endpoints, regardless of whether the data were observed or missing. 
Protocol Deviations 
Through Week 8, 138 subjects (14.4%) had the following major protocol deviations: 
•  Ninety-two subjects (9.6%) were reported to have entered the study but did not meet entry 
criteria; 1 additional subject did not complete the optional genetic informed-consent form but was 
not reported as having a major protocol deviation. 
• 
Four subjects (0.4%) were reported to have received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose of 
study agent at Week 0. 
•  One subject (0.1%) was reported to have received a disallowed concomitant medication. 
• 
Fifty-one subjects (5.3%) were reported to have had protocol deviations for other reasons.

Through the final safety visit, 146 subjects (15.2%; including protocol deviations that occurred through 
Week 8) were reported to have at least 1 major protocol deviation. At or after Week 8, 1 subject (0.1%) 
developed withdrawal criteria but did not withdraw; 3 subjects received the wrong treatment or incorrect 
dose of study agent at 
Week 8; and 9 subjects were reported to have protocol deviations for other reasons. 
Subjects may have been counted in more than 1 category or may have had more than 1 deviation within 
a category. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary and Major Secondary Results for the Induction Study 
Clinical Remission at Week 8 – Global Definition  
The primary endpoint for the induction phase of the study was the induction of clinical remission.  Clinical 
remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤2 points, with no individual subscore >1. 
The results demonstrate that at Week 8, significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 
130 mg groups achieved clinical remission (15.5% and 15.6%, respectively) compared with subjects in 
the placebo group (5.3%; p<0.001 for both comparisons).

Clinical Remission at Week 8 – US Definition 
The primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8, US definition, was defined as an absolute stool 
number ≤3, a Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1. 
At Week 8, significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved 
clinical remission (18.9% and 16.6%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group (6.3%; 
p<0.001 for both comparisons).

Endoscopic Healing at Week 8 
Endoscopic healing (ie, improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa) was defined as Mayo 
endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1. 
At Week 8, significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved 
endoscopic healing (27.0% and 26.3%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group 
(13.8%; p<0.001 for both comparisons).

Clinical Response at Week 8 
Clinical response (second major secondary endpoint) was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo 
score by ≥30% and≥3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or 
a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 
Significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved clinical 
response (61.8% and 51.3%, respectively) at Week 8 than in the placebo group (31.3%; p<0.001 for 
both ustekinumab groups; Table 9 below). The proportion of subjects in clinical response at Week 8 in the 
~6 mg/kg group was approximately 10 percentage points higher than in the 130 mg group.

Change from Baseline in Total IBDQ Score at Week 8 
The IBDQ is a disease-specific instrument composed of 32 Likert-scaled items. The total score ranges 
from 32 to 224 using the 7-point response options, with higher scores indicating better health-related 
quality of life; an increase of ≥16 points has been observed to be consistent with clinically relevant 
improvement. 
The IBDQ scale contains 4 component dimensions: bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional 
function, and social function. Each dimension can be computed with total scores ranging from 10 to 70, 5 
to 35, 12 to 84, and 5 to 35, respectively. 
At baseline, median IBDQ scores were similar across all treatment groups. At Week 8, the median 
improvements from baseline in the IBDQ scores were significantly greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg 
groups (31.0 and 31.5, respectively) compared with the placebo group (10.0; p<0.001 for both 
comparisons).

Mucosal Healing (additional multiplicity-controlled endpoint) 
Mucosal healing was defined as a combination of both endoscopic healing (ie, a Mayo endoscopy subscore 
of 0 or 1) and histologic healing (defined as neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, 
and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue). At Week 8, significantly greater proportions of 
subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved mucosal healing (18.4% and 20.3%, respectively) 
compared with subjects in the placebo group (8.9%; p<0.001 for both comparisons).

Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Clinical Remission at Week 8 
When remission was assessed as clinical remission (global definition) with a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 
at Week 8, the proportions of subjects who achieved this endpoint were in line with those observed based 
on the primary efficacy analysis (global definition). Significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 
mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved this endpoint (15.2% and 15.3%, respectively) compared with 
subjects in the placebo group (5.3%; p<0.001 for both comparisons).

Normal or Inactive Mucosal Disease at Week 8 
Normal or inactive mucosal disease was defined as a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0. At Week 8, 
significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved normal or 
inactive mucosal disease (7.8% and 10.3%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group 
(3.8%; p=0.028 and p=0.001, respectively).

Histologic Healing at Week 8 
Histologic healing was neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, 
ulcerations, or granulation tissue. 
At Week 8, significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups achieved 
histologic healing (35.6% and 37.9%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group 
(21.9%; p<0.001 for both comparisons).  For this analysis subjects with an unevaluable biopsy at Week 
8 were excluded.  A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted by considering subjects with an 
unevaluable biopsy (ie, a biopsy that was collected, but could not be assessed due to sample preparation 
or technical errors) at Week 8 as not having histologic healing and the results were consistent with those 
presented below.

Markers of Inflammation 
Ustekinumab reduced both a serum-based marker of inflammation (CRP) and fecal-based markers of 
inflammation (fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin). 
Significant reductions in, and normalization of, these biomarkers were observed for both dose groups as 
early as Week 2 (the first postbaseline visit) for CRP and Week 4 for the fecal markers 
For both fecal markers of inflammation, the ~6 mg/kg group had greater reductions from baseline than 
the 130 mg group at all visits through Week 8.

Mayo Score Endpoints 
The MAH has also presented results based on Mayo score and partial mayo score over time.  
The Mayo score is calculated as the sum of the four subscores of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, 
findings of endoscopy, and PGA; values range from 0 to 12.  The partial Mayo score excludes endoscopy 
findings and the modified Mayo score excludes the PGA subscore; values for each range from 0 to 9. At 
baseline, the mean Mayo scores were the same across all treatment groups (8.9 for all groups). At Week 
8, the mean decreases from baseline in Mayo scores were significantly greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 
mg groups (3.5 and 3.2, respectively) compared with the placebo group (1.8; p<0.001 for both 
comparisons). 
At baseline, the mean partial Mayo scores were the same across all treatment groups (6.2 for all 
groups). As early as Week 2 and continuing for visits through Week 8, the mean decreases in the partial 
Mayo score were significantly greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups compared with the placebo 
group.  
At Week 2, the mean decreases from baseline in the partial Mayo scores were 1.6 and 1.5, in the ~6 
mg/kg and 130 mg, respectively, compared with 1.0 in the placebo group (p<0.001 for both 
comparisons).  
At Week 8, the mean decreases from baseline in the partial Mayo scores were 2.9 and 2.6, in the ~6 
mg/kg and 130 mg, respectively, compared with 1.5 in the placebo group (p<0.001 for both 
comparisons). 
At baseline the mean modified Mayo score was also the same across all treatment groups (6.6 for all 
groups).  At Week 8, the mean decreases from baseline in the modified Mayo score were significantly 
greater in the ~6 mg/kg (2.6) and 130 mg (2.3) groups than in the placebo group (1.3; p<0.001 for both 
comparisons).

Health-Related Quality of Life 
The SF-36 evaluates 8 individual subscales (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general 
health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) and the physical component 
summary (PCS; calculated from the subscales physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and 
general health) and the mental component summary (MCS; calculated from the subscales vitality, social 
functioning, role-emotional and mental health) scores.  Each of the SF-36 subscales and 2 summary 
scores were derived and were scaled to scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10. Higher 
scores indicate better general health status. 
At Week 8, significantly greater median increases in the PCS, MCS, and all 8 scale scores of the SF-36 
were observed in both ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group. In addition, greater 
proportions of subjects in both ustekinumab groups achieved a clinically meaningful improvement 
(≥5-point) from baseline in both PCS and MCS scores, indicating greater improvement in general 
health-related quality of life. 
At Week 8, median changes from baseline in the EQ-5D index and the health state VAS were significantly 
greater in both ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group.

Clinical Endpoints by Biologic Failure Status 
For subjects with, and subjects without a history of biologic failure, the proportions of subjects who 
achieved clinical remission (global and US definitions), endoscopic healing, and clinical response were 
significantly greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups compared with subjects in the placebo group 
(p<0.025 for both comparisons). 
Though the treatment differences were generally similar between subjects who had a history of biologic 
failure and those who did not, the proportions of subjects who achieved each endpoint were consistently 
lower across all treatment groups for subjects who had a history of biologic failure compared with those 
who did not have a history of biologic failure. 
Clinical remission by biologic failure status - Global Definition 
Of the subjects who had a history of biologic failure, significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 
mg/kg and 130 mg groups (12.7% and 11.6%, respectively), achieved clinical remission at Week 8 
(global definition) compared with subjects in the placebo group (1.2%; p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Of the subjects who did not have a history of biologic failure, significantly greater proportions of subjects 
in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups (18.6% and 19.9% respectively), achieved clinical remission at 
Week 8 (global definition), compared with subjects in the placebo group (9.5%; p=0.022 and p=0.009,

in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups (66.7% and 57.7%, respectively) achieved clinical response at Week 
8 compared with subjects in the placebo group (35.4%; p<0.001 for both comparisons).

Consistent with the rates of clinical response in the primary analysis population, the proportion of 
subjects achieving clinical response at Week 8 was higher in the ~6 mg/kg group than in the 130 mg 
group regardless of biologic failure history. 
Number of Subjects in Clinical Response at Week 8 by Biologic Failure Status: Primary 
Efficacy Analysis Set 
Clinical Endpoints Based on Selected Biologic Failure Profiles 
Post-hoc analyses were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the clinical endpoints of clinical remission 
(global and US definitions), endoscopic healing, clinical response, and mucosal healing based on the 
following biologic failure profiles: subjects who were biologic-naïve, subjects who were biologic failures to 
at least 1 anti-TNF (regardless of vedolizumab), and subjects who were biologic failures to both anti-TNF 
and vedolizumab. These subpopulations were identified as they represent the general treatment pathway 
for patients with UC and indicate progressively more refractory disease. 
Subjects who were biologic-naïve comprised 94.3% of subjects (443 of 470 subjects) who did not have a 
history of biologic failure. In this subpopulation, the proportions of subjects who achieved each of the 
clinical endpoints of clinical remission (global and US definitions), endoscopic healing clinical response, 
and mucosal healing were significantly greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups compared with 
subjects in the placebo group (p<0.05 for both comparisons)

Summary of UC-Related Biologic Medication History: Primary Analysis Set
Subjects who were biologic failures to at least 1 anti-TNF (regardless of vedolizumab) comprised 98.8% 
of subjects (485 of 491 subjects) who had a history of biologic failure. In this subpopulation, the 
proportions of subjects who achieved each of the clinical endpoints of clinical remission (global and US 
definitions), endoscopic healing, clinical response, and mucosal healing were significantly greater in the 
~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups compared with subjects in the placebo group (p≤0.002 for all 
comparisons).

Summary of Key Efficacy Endpoints at Week 8: Subjects in Primary Efficacy Analysis Set who 
Failed at Least 1 Anti-TNF (regardless of Vedolizumab) 
Subjects who are biologic failures to both anti-TNF and vedolizumab comprised 16.6% of subjects 
randomized in this study (160 of 961 subjects) and 32.6% of subjects (160 of 491 subjects) who had a 
history of biologic failure. In this subpopulation, the proportions of subjects who achieved clinical 
remission (global definition) were significantly greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups compared 
with subjects in the placebo group (p=0.033, p=0.019, respectively).  
For the other clinical endpoints (clinical remission [US definition], endoscopic healing, clinical response, 
and mucosal healing) statistical significance was not reached however the proportions of subjects who 
achieved each endpoint were numerically greater in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups compared with 
subjects in the placebo group.  The exception is the result for the clinical response endpoint for the ~6 
mg/kg group, where statistical significance was achieved (p=0.036).

A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ustekinumab 
Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to Severely 
Active Ulcerative Colitis 
- Maintenance Study - 
Methods 
Study participants 
The maintenance study was a Phase 3, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, 
randomized-withdrawal study that was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SC regimens of 
ustekinumab maintenance therapy in the primary population of subjects with moderately to severely 
active UC who were induced into clinical response with IV ustekinumab. 
Although all subjects who were responders to study agent in the induction study were eligible to be 
enrolled in the maintenance study, only subjects who were in clinical response to IV ustekinumab during 
induction comprised the primary population in the maintenance study (Figure 4). The following subjects 
from the induction study were included in the primary population of the maintenance study: 
• 
• 
Subjects who were randomized to receive IV ustekinumab at Week 0 of the induction study and 
were in clinical response at Week 8 of the induction study. 
Subjects who were randomized to receive IV placebo at Week 0 of the induction study and were 
not in clinical response at Week 8 but were in clinical response at Week 16 of the induction study 
after receiving an induction dose of IV ustekinumab (~6 mg/kg) at Week 8.

ustekinumab Crohn’s disease program, which were chosen based on data from the Phase 2b study in 
Crohn’s disease. The ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w dose regimen was selected because it was considered 
safe and effective in achieving remission among subjects randomized as responders to ustekinumab 
induction in the Phase 2b study.26 To explore a lower dose regimen in the Phase 3 study in Crohn’s 
disease, the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w dose regimen was included because it was the next lower dose 
regimen that had been studied extensively in psoriasis and was considered likely to succeed in 
maintaining clinical efficacy over time in patients with Crohn’s disease. These maintenance doses 
provided systemic exposures that were likely to meet the safety and efficacy objectives for the 
development of ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease and subsequently in UC. 
Steroid tapering 
For subjects who were receiving oral corticosteroids on entry into the maintenance study, the investigator 
was to begin tapering the daily dose of corticosteroids beginning at Week 0 of the maintenance study. 
The recommended tapering schedule for oral prednisone-equivalent (P.Eq) corticosteroids was as 
follows: 
•  Subjects receiving >20 mg/day P.Eq: taper daily dose by 5 mg/week until 0 mg/day. 
•  Subjects receiving ≤20 mg/day P.Eq: taper daily dose by 2.5 mg/week until 0 mg/day. 
Tapering of budesonide or beclomethasone dipropionate followed local clinical practice. Subjects were 
permitted to transiently (ie, for ≤4 weeks) use increased doses of corticosteroids for reasons other than 
loss of response (eg, stress doses of corticosteroids for surgery, asthma flare, adrenocortical 
insufficiency). 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the maintenance study were: 
•  To evaluate clinical remission for SC maintenance regimens of ustekinumab in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC induced into clinical response with ustekinumab. 
•  To  evaluate  the  safety  of  SC  maintenance  regimens  of  ustekinumab  in  subjects  with 
moderately to severely active UC induced into clinical response with ustekinumab. 
The secondary objectives of the maintenance study were: 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in maintaining clinical response in subjects induced into 
clinical response with ustekinumab. 
•  To  evaluate  endoscopic  healing  (ie,  improvement  in  the  endoscopic  appearance  of  the mucosa) 
in subjects induced into clinical response with ustekinumab. 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in achieving corticosteroid-free clinical remission in subjects 
induced into clinical response with ustekinumab. 
•  To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  ustekinumab  in  maintaining  clinical  remission  in  subjects induced 
into clinical remission with ustekinumab. 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab treatment on mucosal healing (ie, a combination of 
endoscopic healing and histologic healing). 
•  To  evaluate 
the 
impact  of 
SC 
ustekinumab  on 
disease-specific
patient-reported health-related quality of life. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019

•  To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  maintenance  therapy  with  SC  ustekinumab  by  biologic  failure status. 
•  To  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  immunogenicity  of  ustekinumab,  as  well  as changes 
in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and other pharmacodynamic 
(PD) biomarkers. 
The exploratory objective of the maintenance study was to evaluate response using the Mayo score 
without the physician's global assessment (PGA) subscore.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
•  Clinical remission at Week 44. Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤2 points, with no 
individual subscore >1. 
Major Secondary Endpoints (presented in the order in which they were tested) 
•  Maintenance of clinical response through Week 44. Clinical response was defined as a decrease 
from induction baseline in the Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, with either a decrease from 
induction baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 
Clinical response was calculated at Week 44 and at other time points during maintenance when 
endoscopy subscores were collected (eg, at the time of clinical flare to assess loss of clinical 
response or at the time of discontinuation of study agent or termination of study participation); 
subjects who were not in clinical response at any of these times were considered not to be in 
clinical response through Week 44. 
• 
Endoscopic healing at Week 44. Endoscopic healing (ie, improvement in the endoscopic 
appearance of the mucosa) was defined as endoscopy subscore of the Mayo score = 0 or 1. 
•  Clinical remission and not receiving concomitant corticosteroids (ie, corticosteroid-free clinical 
remission) at Week 44.  
•  Maintenance of clinical remission through Week 44 among the subjects who had achieved clinical 
remission at maintenance baseline. Clinical remission was calculated at Week 44 and at other 
time points during maintenance when endoscopy subscores were collected (eg, at the time of 
clinical flare to assess loss of clinical response or at the time of discontinuation of study agent or 
termination of study participation); subjects who were not in clinical remission at any of these 
times were considered not to be in clinical remission through Week 44.  
Efficacy results presented for CNTO1275UCO3001 induction and maintenance studies were based on 
central review of endoscopies.  
Terminology of some endpoints used in the UC dossier is different than the terminology proposed to be 
used in the EU Product Information. An overview of the different terminologies is included in Table 10. 
Sample size 
For both global and US-specific testing procedures, a fixed-sequence testing procedure, starting with the 
high dose group (q8w), will be used to control the overall Type I error rate at the0.05 level (2-sided).  
Therefore, sample size/power calculations were based on the chi-square test to detect a significant 
difference between subjects receiving SC ustekinumab 90 mg q8w and those receiving placebo. 
The treatment effect for the global definition of the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 44 in 
the maintenance study, was based on maintenance data from similarly designed studies of the anti-TNFα

golimumab and of vedolizumab. In the golimumab UC maintenance study, the proportions of subjects in 
clinical remission (based on the global definition) at Week 54 (among subjects in clinical response to 
golimumab induction) were 34% and 22% in the 100 mg group and the placebo group, respectively. In 
the vedolizumab UC study, the proportions of subjects in clinical remission (based on the global 
definition) at Week 52 (among subjects in clinical response at Week 6) were 42% and 16% in the 
vedolizumab q8w group and the placebo group, respectively. For the CNTO1275UCO3001 maintenance 
study, it was assumed that clinical remission rates (based on the global definition) at Week 44 were 40% 
and 20%, respectively, for the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w and placebo groups. 
Assuming a 20% clinical remission rate (for both global and US definitions) in the placebo group and 40% 
in the SC ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group, the applicant argued that 109 subjects in each treatment group 
(327 subjects in total) would provide statistical power of 90% at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). The 
table below shows the power for detecting a treatment difference between the SC ustekinumab 90 mg 
q8w and the placebo group based on different proportions of subjects in clinical remission (for both the 
global and US definitions) at Week 44 with a fixed sample size of 327. 
The table below shows the power for detecting a treatment difference between the ustekinumab 90 mg 
SC q8w and the placebo group for each of the major secondary endpoints with 327 subjects in the primary 
population. The assumptions about the proportion of subjects achieving each major secondary endpoint 
were based on data from the golimumab and vedolizumab maintenance studies in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC. 
The number of subjects in the primary analysis population of the maintenance study will depend on the 
number of subjects from the following 2 groups of the induction study: 
1) subjects in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction at Week 8 of the induction study 
(Group A), and 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 77/161 
 
 
 
 
 
2) subjects who were not in clinical response to IV placebo induction at Week 8 of the induction 
study but were in clinical response at induction Week 16 after receiving an induction dose of IV 
ustekinumab at Week 8 (Group B). 
If the average clinical response rate to IV ustekinumab induction is 45%, 317 subjects in each induction 
treatment group (for a total of 951 subjects) will result in about 328 subjects in the primary population of 
the maintenance study, assuming 15% attrition from the induction study to the maintenance study. 
However, the average clinical response rate to IV ustekinumab induction could range from 40% to 50% 
and attrition from the induction study to the maintenance study could range from 10% to 15%. With 317 
subjects in each induction treatment group, the number of subjects in the primary population of the 
maintenance study could range from 290 to 385 
Randomisation 
Subjects who were in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
one of the following three treatment groups at the maintenance Week 0/baseline visit of the maintenance 
study: 
• 
• 
• 
Placebo SC 
Ustekinumab 90 mg SC every 12 weeks (q12w) 
Ustekinumab 90 mg SC every 8 weeks (q8w) 
Eligible subjects were allocated to a treatment group using a permuted block randomization with clinical 
remission status at maintenance baseline (yes/no, with remission defined as Mayo score ≤2 points, with 
no individual subscore >1), oral corticosteroid use at maintenance baseline (yes/no), and induction 
treatment as stratification variables.  
The stratification levels for induction treatment were defined as follows: subjects who received 
ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV (Week 0); subjects who received ustekinumab 130 mg IV (Week 0); subjects 
who received placebo IV at induction Week 0, did not respond, and received ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV at 
induction Week 8 [this group is hereafter referred to as the placebo IV (Week 0) → ~6 mg/kg IV (Week 
8) group].  
Because subjects in this study were assigned to different dosing frequencies, all subjects received study 
agent (ie, ustekinumab or placebo) at all scheduled study agent administration visits to maintain the 
blind.   
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 78/161 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no interim analyses and the first database lock (DBL) for the maintenance study occurred 
when all subjects in the maintenance study completed the Week 44 visit or terminated study participation 
before Week 44. 
Blinding (masking) 
The sponsor was blinded to treatment assignment in the maintenance study until after the Week 44 DBL 
occurred. To minimize bias and protect the integrity of the clinical program, treatment assignment 
blinding was maintained (for both the induction and maintenance studies) for investigative sites, site 
monitors, and subjects participating in this protocol until the Week 44 analyses were completed. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The Primary Efficacy Analysis Set consists of all subjects randomized at Week 0 of this maintenance 
study, that is, subjects in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction as determined by the IWRS (i.e., 
subjects who are in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction at I-8, or subjects who are not in clinical 
response to IV placebo induction at I-8 but are in clinical response at I-16 after receiving an induction 
dose of IV ustekinumab at I-8).  
Some prespecified efficacy analyses will also be conducted in the Non-randomized Analysis Set, 
which includes: 
- 
- 
Subjects in clinical response to placebo IV induction dosing at I-8. 
Subjects who are delayed responders to ustekinumab induction. 
Analysis Methods – Primary endpoint 
The global definition of clinical remission is: A Mayo score ≤2 points, with no individual subscore 
>1. In addition to the clinical remission status based on the Mayo score, treatment failure rules will be 
applied to determine the final clinical remission status for a subject. Subjects who have a protocol-defined 
treatment failure prior to Week 44 will be considered not to be in clinical remission at Week 44, regardless 
of the actual computation of clinical remission based on the Mayo score. Subjects who have all 4 Mayo 
subscores missing at Week 44 will be considered not to be in clinical remission. If 1 or more of the 4 Mayo 
subscores is missing at a specific visit, but not all 4 subscores are missing, the last available value for each 
missing subscore will be carried forward to compute a full Mayo score (where the full mayo score is 
scheduled to be collected). 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission were to be compared between each ustekinumab 
treatment group and the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified 
by clinical remission status at baseline (yes/no as determined by the IWRS) and induction treatment 
(placebo IV [I-0] → ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV [I-8], ustekinumab 130 mg IV [I-0], or ustekinumab ~6 
mg/kg IV [I-0]). 
Summaries of the proportion of subjects in clinical remission by treatment group, the adjusted treatment 
difference (with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weight) between each ustekinumab treatment group and the 
placebo group, as well as the associated 95% confidence interval were to be provided. 
Sensitivity Analyses – Primary endpoint 
The following sensitivity analyses were to be performed to examine the robustness of the primary 
endpoint analysis for the global definition of the primary endpoint: 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 79/161 
 
 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 1 (Observed case): exclude subjects who have missing data at Week 44 and 
have not had an event of treatment failure prior to Week 44. 
For the global definition, subjects with missing data are those who are missing all four Mayo subscores. 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 (nonresponder if any missing subscore): subjects with missing data for any 
of the Mayo components pertaining to the primary endpoint (ie, the four Mayo subscores for the global 
definition and the absolute stool number, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore, and Mayo endoscopy subscore 
for the US-specific definition) at Week 44 are considered not to be in clinical remission. 
Sensitivity Analysis 3 (multiple imputation): This analysis was to be based on the multiple 
imputation method which involves the following distinct steps: 
1)  Any missing Mayo components pertaining to the primary endpoint (see Sensitivity Analysis number 
4) at Week 44 will be imputed 5 times to generate 5 complete data sets using the Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo method, assuming missing at random (MAR) and a multivariate normal distribution 
(since the amount of missing data will be minimal based on the past UC induction studies). The 
following variables will be included in the imputation model: Mayo components at Week 0 of 
induction study and at week 0 and week 44 of the maintenance study, induction dose factor and 
maintenance treatment group 
2)  Before the multiple imputation method is applied, the Mayo data after treatment failure will be set 
to missing. For each multiple-imputed data set, each subject’s clinical remission status at Week 44 
will be calculated. 
3)  Each of the 5 resulting data sets will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment 
group, baseline Mayo score (for global definition) and induction treatment as covariates. 
4)  The results from the 5 data sets will be combined to produce inferential results. 
Sensitivity Analysis 4 (Worst case): subjects receiving placebo who have missing data at Week 44 
and have not had an event of treatment failure prior to Week 44 will be considered to be in clinical 
remission, and subjects receiving ustekinumab who have missing data at Week 44 will be considered not 
to be in clinical remission. 
Sensitivity Analysis 5 (“modified ITT” analysis): excludes subjects who are randomized but not 
treated. 
Sensitivity Analysis 6 (per-protocol” analysis): excludes subjects with at least 1 of the following 
deviations that might affect efficacy: 
1)  subjects who are found to have Crohn's disease instead of UC,  
2)  subjects who are randomized, but do not receive study agent,  
3)  subjects who are a treatment failure in the induction study,  
4)  subjects who are excluded in the Per-Protocol analysis in the induction study,  
5)  subjects who are randomized to the placebo group at Week 0 but receive a ustekinumab injection 
at any administration visit through Week 44 or subjects who are randomized to one of the 
ustekinumab groups at Week 0 but receive only placebo through Week 44 ,  
6)  subjects who are not in clinical response on entry into the maintenance study based on the final 
reported endoscopy score and the eCRF Mayo score data, or have other deviations that will be 
identified and documented prior to unblinding. 
Sensitivity Analysis 7 (logistic regression): For the global definition, the primary endpoint will be 
analyzed based on a logistic regression with maintenance baseline Mayo score, induction treatment, and 
maintenance treatment group as covariates 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 80/161 
 
 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 8 (clinical remission based on local endoscopy subscores): the primary 
analysis will be repeated with clinical remission derived based on local endoscopy subscores, instead of 
the final reported endoscopic subscores. 
The same treatment failure rules as were used in the primary analysis were to be applied. For Sensitivity 
Analyses 5 through 8, the same missing data rules as are used in the primary analysis were also to be 
applied. Note that treatment failure rules were to override the missing data rules. Subjects who have a 
treatment failure prior to Week 44 were considered not to be in clinical remission at Week 44, regardless 
of the observed or missing data. 
Analysis Methods – Major secondary endpoints 
The major secondary endpoint analyses were to be based on the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set. Except for 
the fourth major secondary endpoint of maintenance of clinical remission, analyses of major secondary 
endpoints were to be conducted using a CMH chi-square test stratified by clinical remission status at 
maintenance baseline (yes/no as determined by the IWRS) and induction treatment. For the fourth major 
secondary endpoint, a CMH chi-square test stratified by induction treatment will be used.  
Summaries of the proportion of subjects by treatment group, the adjusted treatment difference (with 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weight) between each ustekinumab treatment group and the placebo group, as 
well as the associated 95% confidence interval, were to be provided for all the major secondary 
endpoints.  
Type I error control – multiple testing procedure 
A fixed-sequence testing procedure was to be used to control the overall Type I error rate at the .05 level 
for the primary endpoint. Specifically, the high maintenance dose group  
(i.e., ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w) will be considered significant if its p-value is < 0.05. The low 
maintenance dose group (ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w) will be significant if the p-value for both high and 
low maintenance dose groups are < 0.05.  
The study was to be considered positive if the test involving the high maintenance dose group 
(ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w) shows a statistically significant difference versus placebo for the primary 
endpoint of clinical remission at Week 44, regardless of the result of the test for the low maintenance dose 
(ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w). 
A hierarchical testing procedure as shown below was to be employed to control the overall Type 1 error 
rate over the 4 major secondary efficacy analyses at the (2-sided) 0.05 significance level within a dose 
group. A major secondary endpoint for a dose group will be considered significant only if both the previous 
endpoints in the hierarchy and current endpoint test positive at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. If 
an endpoint is not significant, all subsequent tests in the hierarchy will be considered not to be significant. 
Nominal p-values will be reported for all analyses.

Subgroup analyses 
The consistency of treatment effect for the primary endpoint was to be evaluated for subgroups based on 
demographics and baseline UC disease characteristics, UC-related concomitant medication usage, and 
UC-related Medication History, all at Week 0 of the induction study, as well as maintenance stratification 
factors and UC clinical disease characteristics at Week 0 of the maintenance study, when the number of 
subjects within each level of the subgroup permits 
For each of these subgroups, the odds ratio of each ustekinumab dose group vs placebo and the 
associated confidence interval (95% for the global definition and 97.5% for the US-specific definition) 
were to be provided. The odds ratios and confidence intervals were to be provided based on the logistic 
regression model that includes factors for treatment group, biologic failure status and region (for the 
subgroup analyses based on biologic failure status or region, the corresponding factor will not be included 
in the model).

Treatment failure criteria 
Subjects who had any of the following events were considered to be a treatment failure from the time of 
event onward: 
An ostomy or colectomy (partial or total). 
Discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or due to an AE of worsening of UC. 
Used a rescue medication after clinical flare: Any initiation or increase in the dose of 6-MP/AZA/MTX, oral 
budesonide >3 mg/day, oral beclomethasone dipropionate >5 mg/day, or oral corticosteroids (excluding 
budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate) >5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) above the dose 
received at maintenance baselinefollowing a clinical flare was considered a rescue medication. 
A prohibited change in UC medication: 
Initiation of restricted or prohibited medication 
Missing data 
For subjects with missing data, unless otherwise specified, the last observation was carried forward for 
continuous endpoints, with the exception of the Mayo and partial Mayo scores where the last available 
Mayo subscores were carried forward. For dichotomous endpoints, subjects with missing data were 
considered not to have achieved the respective endpoints. 
Treatment failure rules overrode missing data rules. This meant that if a subject had an event of 
treatment failure, induction baseline values were assigned from the point of treatment failure onward for 
continuous endpoints, and subjects were not considered to have achieved the respective endpoints for 
dichotomous endpoints, regardless of whether the data were observed or missing. 
Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis was planned for the maintenance study.

Subject disposition in CNTO1275UCO3001 Maintenance Study; Randomized Subjects 
A total of 783 subjects who completed the induction study and were in clinical response to induction study 
agent were enrolled in this maintenance. Of these, 523 subjects were in the targeted primary population 
for the maintenance study and were randomized (i.e., were in clinical response to IV ustekinumab 
induction; randomized subjects) and 260 subjects were not part of the primary population for the 
maintenance study and were not randomized (i.e., placebo induction responders and ustekinumab 
induction delayed responders; nonrandomized subjects).

Conduct of the study 
There were 2 amendments to the protocol, both of which were substantial. The first amendment (14 July 
2015) was implemented before study initiation and incorporated health authority feedback. The second 
amendment (20 April 2016) addressed health authority requests for additional data collection and 
included other clarifications. Changes that affected study conduct or data analyses of the induction study 
are detailed in the table below presents the changes that affected study conduct or data analyses of the 
maintenance study only.

Protocol Amendment Changes1 
Sample collection for anti-ustekinumab antibodies was added at the Week 4 visit 
during maintenance. 
Study agent administrations at Week 20, Week 28, and Week 44 were deleted from the 
Time and Events Schedule for maintenance because these administrations, for placebo 
only, were not required to maintain the study blind for either maintenance dose 
regimen. 
Text was added to clarify that the global definition of clinical remission will be used to 
stratify subjects in the randomization for the maintenance study. 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test (rather than the logistic regression model) 
is to be used for the primary and major secondary efficacy analyses for the 
maintenance study. 
Clarified that the United States (US) definition of clinical remission will be used to 
support the US submission only and added that each definition (global and US definition) 
will be based on the primary population. 
Clarified that if tuberculin was unavailable for the tuberculosis (TB) skin test, this 
method of testing was not to be considered required for Ukrainian study centers. 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold and chest radiograph were done if tuberculosis was 
suspected, along with referral to a TB specialist if possible. 
The order of the third and fourth secondary objectives/major secondary endpoints in 
the maintenance study was reversed (new order is: corticosteroid-free remission at 
Week 44 followed by maintenance of clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects in 
clinical remission at Week 0). In addition, the analysis population for the endpoint of 
corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44 was updated to include all subjects 
randomized into the maintenance study regardless of corticosteroid use at the 
maintenance Week 0 visit (instead of being limited to only subjects who were receiving 
corticosteroids at the maintenance Week 0 visit). 
Clarified procedures to determine clinical flare and loss of response. 
The recommendation for tapering budesonide was revised and tapering for 
beclomethasone dipropionate was incorporated. 
Clarification of which endoscopy score was used to determine subject eligibility at 
baseline and for the primary and major secondary endpoints involving endoscopy 
subscores. 
The statistical methods Section was revised to specify that a fixed-sequence testing 
procedure will be used for submission in the US. 
Overall, among 523 randomized subjects and 260 nonrandomized subjects, protocol deviations were 
reported in 40 (7.6%) subjects and 19 (7.3%) subjects, respectively. Most deviations (52 of 59 subjects) 
were classified as “other”. Deviations related to withdrawal criteria, treatment, dose, or use of disallowed 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 88/161 
 
 
 
 
medications were infrequent events. Subjects who were identified to have met withdrawal criteria were 
promptly directed to discontinue study agent. Subjects who were identified to have received an incorrect 
dose received the assigned study agent and dose for the majority of visits and were analyzed in their 
assigned treatment groups. Subjects who were identified as having initiated disallowed medication did 
not initiate any medications that were prohibited and would have required discontinuation of study agent. 
During the study, specific deviations were addressed at the site level as well as through study- wide site 
communications and trainings. Issues were addressed during the conduct of the study with appropriate 
corrective and preventative action before DBL.  
Protocol deviations varied in nature and were determined not to have clinically relevant impact on data 
integrity or subject safety. Overall, assessment of efficacy was not adversely affected by these 
deviations, as demonstrated by similar results in the primary efficacy analyses and the per-protocol 
sensitivity analyses. Similarly, there was no notable effect of deviations on the safety profile of 
ustekinumab in this study; overall, the safety profile observed was consistent with the disease under 
study and the labelled safety information for ustekinumab in other indications. 
Baseline data 
All subjects in this maintenance study entered from the induction study. The primary population is the 
population of randomized subjects. Therefore, presentation of data focuses on the randomized subjects, 
while presentation of data from the nonrandomized subjects is also provided with a focus on the 
ustekinumab induction delayed-responder group.

Comparison of baseline Demographic Baseline Data between induction and maintenance
Generally, the treatment groups were well balanced in terms of demographic, disease characteristics and 
of concomitant and previous therapies. No clinically relevant imbalances were observed. The 
inflammatory burden, as judged by faecal calprotectin, were slightly higher in the ustekinumab groups 
than in the placebo group. The difference is of doubtful relevance and in any instance not in favour to the 
test drug and as such not inducing any bias in favour of the test drug.

Discontinuation of study agent
Subjects were randomised per clinical remission and steroid use at maintenance baseline. The 
proportions of patients in each arm remained similar between induction and maintenance for important 
variable such as UC disease characteristics, prior biological failure status. In 24.6%, 14% and 10.2% of 
subjects in the placebo, q12w and q8w arms respectively study treatment was discontinued. This does 
not appear higher than phase 3 studies for other therapies in UC. 
Numbers analysed 
The Primary Efficacy Analysis Set consisted of 523 subjects who were in clinical response to IV 
ustekinumab induction and were randomized to ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w, ustekinumab 90 mg  SC 
q12w,  or  placebo  SC.  All efficacy analyses were based on the ITT principle; therefore, subjects were 
analyzed according to the group to which they were assigned regardless of the treatment received.

The primary endpoint of clinical remission was met with a treatment difference of 14.5% 19.7% for the 
q12w and q8w. The secondary endpoint of steroid free clinical remission was considered the key other 
endpoint in view of the current CHMP guidelines. This endpoint was also met and the proportions of 
patients meeting each guideline are >95% concordant. The other controlled secondary endpoints were 
met, except for maintaining clinical remission for the 90 mg q8w. There was a very modest treatment 
benefit of the q8w versus the q12w with the exception of sustained clinical remission although of the 
major secondary endpoints, this endpoint had the weakest power to detect a change. 
Overall, Ustekinumab SC maintenance therapy achieved significantly greater clinical remission and 
response through Week 44 compared to placebo and also achieved greater endoscopic healing and 
corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44 in this study of subjects with moderately to severely active UC 
who had responded to ustekinumab IV induction therapy.

The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint of steroid free clinical remission were met in subjects 
with and without a history of biological failure. The other controlled secondary endpoints were met, 
except for maintaining clinical remission for the 90 mg q8w. There was a treatment benefit of >10 
percentage points for all endpoints, except clinical response, for the q8w versus the q12w in subjects with 
a history of biological failure. The q8w and and q12w were similar in patients without biological failure. 
It is noted that subjects who were biologically naïve accounted for 94.2% of the biological non-failure 
group. Subjects who received at least one anti-TNF accounted for 99.2% who were biological failures 
regardless of vedolizumab. Only 2/249 had received vedolizumab only in this group.

The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint of steroid free clinical remission were not met in 
subjects who were failures to an anti-TNF and vedolizumab. There was a trend towards a benefit of 
ustekinumab versus placebo (greatest effect size for the q8w) but it did not reach significance and the 
number were very low, less than 10 in each arm.  
Ancillary analyses 
The following analyses for week 8 Non-responders are derived from the induction study only.  
Efficacy for Week 8 Non-responders who received additional treatment at Week 8 
A total of 417 subjects (placebo + ustekinumab treated patients) were not in clinical response at Week 8 
(as determined by the IWRS) and received an additional administration of either IV or SC ustekinumab at 
Week 8 
The applicant discusses the demographic, baseline characteristics and relevant medical history of the 
Week 8 treated set and there were no significant difference/findings to note. 
Subjects who did not achieve clinical response at Week 8 following IV induction dosing at Week 0 received 
an additional dose of study agent at Week 8 as follows: 
•  Subjects who received placebo (IV) at Week 0 received ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg (IV) at Week 8 
(placebo → ~6 mg/kg group; n=184) 
•  Subjects who received ustekinumab 130 mg (IV) at Week 0 received ustekinumab 90 mg SC at 
Week 8 (130 mg → 90 mg SC group; n=132) 
•  Subjects who received ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg (IV) at Week 0 received 90 mg SC at Week 8 (~6 
mg/kg → 90 mg SC group; n=101) 
The following is a summary of these results based on the endpoints of Clinical Remission, Endoscopy and 
Histology (endoscopic, histologic and mucosal healing) and clinical Response: 
Week 8 Non-responders who received Placebo IV at Week 0 and Ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV at 
Week 8 
The proportions of subjects in the placebo → ~6 mg/kg group who achieved each of the endpoints 
mentioned above at Week 16 were as follows: 
Clinical remission (global definition): 13.0% 
Clinical remission (US definition): 16.8%

Efficacy by biologic failure status among Week 8 Non-responders who received additional 
treatment at Week 8 
When the endpoints of clinical remission (global and US definitions), endoscopic healing, and clinical 
response were assessed at Week 16 by biologic failure status (based on the Week 8 treated analysis set), 
consistent with the analyses of these endpoints at Week 8, the proportions of subjects who achieved each 
endpoint were consistently lower across all treatment groups for subjects who had a history of biologic 
failure compared with those who did not. 
Efficacy in Delayed Responders to Induction 
The ustekinumab induction delayed responders (n=157) are subjects who were not in clinical response to 
ustekinumab IV at induction Week 8 but were in clinical response at induction Week 16 after receiving 
ustekinumab 90 mg SC at induction Week 8. These subjects received ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w during 
maintenance.  
Benefit  was  observed  from  continued  maintenance  therapy  with  ustekinumab  (at  90  mg  q8w)  in  the 
ustekinumab  induction  delayed  responders,  although  this  observation  is  based  on  uncontrolled 
observational  data.  A  substantial  proportion  of  these  subjects  (62.4%)  maintained  clinical  response 
through Week 44. These subjects also achieved other measures of efficacy at Week 44, but at rates that 
were lower than those observed in the subjects who were responders to ustekinumab induction and were 
subsequently  randomized  to  ustekinumab  q8w  in  the  primary  population  of  the  maintenance  study 
(Table 6).

A total of 233 (this number represents those subjects treated with ustekinumab at Week 0, excluding 
placebo) did not achieve clinical response at Week 8 after IV induction dosing with ustekinumab at Week 
0 and received ustekinumab 90 mg SC at Week 8. 
The results indicate that benefit was observed after patients received a second ustekinumab dose at 
Week 8. Approximately 60% of these subjects attained clinical response at Week 16 and benefit was also 
observed for other clinical outcomes at Week 16. 
Mucosal healing (endoscopic and histological) 
Patient related quality of life. IBDQ 
At Week 44, the median changes from maintenance baseline in the total IBDQ score were 5.0 and 1.5 
(improved) in the ustekinumab q8w and q12w groups, respectively, compared with -7.0 (worsened) in 
the placebo group (p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Maintenance of the improvements attained during induction were also observed for both ustekinumab 
dose regimens for the IBDQ dimension scores (bowel, emotional, systemic, and social; p≤0.002 for all 
comparisons). 
The effects of ustekinumab in maintaining mucosal healing and IBDQ improvements from the induction 
study are consistent with the major efficacy results. 
Hospitalization or surgery 
The  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  who  had  a  UC  disease-related 
hospitalization or surgery (2.3% [n=8]) was less than the proportion in the placebo group (5.7% [n=10]; 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 96/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p=0.071). The colectomy and hospitalisation rate was low in the maintenance study but there were less 
events in the treatment arms compared to placebo. 
Markers of inflammation 
CRP 
Consistent with the efficacy observed for clinical outcomes, the reductions in both a serum-based marker 
of inflammation (CRP) and fecal-based markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin) 
attained with ustekinumab induction were maintained at Week 44 for both ustekinumab dose regimens 
(90 mg q8w and q12w), while concentrations increased somewhat in the placebo group 
At Week 44, the median changes from maintenance baseline in CRP concentrations were -0.07 mg/L and 
0.38 mg/L for the ustekinumab q8w and q12w groups, respectively, compared with 1.07 mg/L in the 
placebo group (p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
The proportions of subjects with normalized CRP concentration (≤3 mg/L) at Week 44 (among subjects 
with abnormal CRP [>3 mg/L] at induction baseline [53.5%]) were significantly greater in the 
ustekinumab q8w (50.0%) and q12w (44.3%) groups compared with the placebo group (27.7%; 
p=0.002 and p=0.019, respectively). 
Faecal Calprotectin 
The reductions in fecal calprotectin concentrations attained with ustekinumab induction were maintained 
in both the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w and q12w groups (with even further reductions observed in both 
groups), while concentrations increased in the placebo SC group. At Week 44, the median changes from 
maintenance baseline in fecal calprotectin were -85.0 mg/kg and -37.5 mg/kg in the ustekinumab q8w 
and q12w groups, respectively, compared with 229.5 mg/kg in the placebo group (p<0.001 for both 
comparisons); greater reductions were observed in the q8w group than in the q12w group. 
The proportions of subjects with normalized fecal calprotectin (≤250 mg/kg) at Week 44 (among subjects 
with abnormal calprotectin [>250 mg/kg] at induction baseline [81.8%]) were significantly greater in the 
ustekinumab q8w (44.4%) and q12w (47.1%) groups compared with the placebo group (26.0%; 
p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy data from the UCO3001 induction and maintenance studies were not pooled or compared across 
studies because the two studies are based on different treatment phases. Instead, efficacy and 
subpopulation analyses are provided separately for induction and maintenance.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support a positive risk benefit for ustekinumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, the Applicant has 
submitted two pivotal phase 3 studies, one study aiming at demonstrating safety and efficacy in the 
induction of remission setting (CNTO1275UCO3001 induction) and one study aiming at demonstrating 
safety and efficacy in the maintenance of remission setting (CNTO1275UCO3001 maintenance). Both 
studies were randomized, placebo-controlled and double blind. The induction study included patients with 
moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis having failed conventional and or biologic treatment. The 
maintenance therapy included patients who had finalized the induction study and achieved response on 
ustekinumab treatment. The duration of the induction study was 8 weeks but patients not achieving 
response at week 8 were given ustekinumab and allowed to enter the maintenance study if they 
subsequently achieved response at week 16. The duration of the maintenance study was 44 weeks 
making the total study duration 52 weeks (for responders at week 8 in the induction study). Overall the 
design of the studies are considered acceptable and in line with the current EU guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1). The study population reflects the intended target population and is also 
considered acceptable. The primary endpoint in both studies was clinical remission, defined as Mayo score 
≤2 points, with no individual subscore >1, at week 8 and week 44 of the induction and maintenance 
studies, respectively. Major secondary endpoint (for which the overall risk of type 1 error was controlled) 
included endoscopic healing, clinical response and change from baseline in IBDQ (induction study) and 
maintenance of clinical response through Week 44, endoscopic healing at Week 44, clinical remission and 
not receiving concomitant corticosteroids (corticosteroid-free clinical remission) at Week 44 and 
maintenance of clinical remission through Week 44 among the subjects who had achieved clinical 
remission at maintenance baseline (maintenance study). The endpoint used are not in accordance with 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019

the current EU guideline) which recommends that symptomatic remission and endoscopic remission 
should be co-primary endpoints. It is acknowledged that the study was designed and conducted before 
the current revision of the EU guideline came into effect but still it is expected to provide evidence of 
efficacy in both symptoms and endoscopic appearance. 
In that respect it is noted that endoscopic healing (defined as a Mayo endoscopy score of 0 or 1) was 
included as a major secondary endpoint (for which the overall type 1 error was controlled) and that 
symptomatic remission was an ordinary, secondary endpoint (for which overall type 1 error was not 
controlled). Furthermore, in the US application, clinical remission defined as absolute stool number ≤3, 
Mayo rectal bleeding score of 0 and Mayo endoscopy score ≤1 (i.e. only mild erythema and friability) was 
the primary endpoint. The applicant confirmed that the US definition of clinical remission does require 
individual subjects to achieve all 3 elements of the composite endpoint (ie, an absolute stool number ≤3, 
a Mayo rectal bleeding sub score of 0, and a Mayo endoscopy sub score of 0 or 1. Further, the US 
definition of clinical remission was a pre-specified endpoint in the protocol and statistical analysis plan for 
both the induction and the maintenance studies. This explanation was considered satisfactory by the 
CHMP as the presented data does demonstrate efficacy in the domains requested by the EU Guideline.  
The statistical analysis were generally acceptable. Adequate measures to control the overall type 1 error 
were included. Methods for handling intercurrent events and missing values were well described and 
relevant sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of intercurrent events and different ways of imputing 
missing values were planned.  
The study was carried out according to GCP. Judged by the number and type of protocol violations, the 
study appears to be well-conducted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose response 
Dose-ranging was performed in two Phase 2 studies for ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease. No formal 
dose-ranging was studied for ustekinumab in UC.  The ustekinumab dose regimens selected for the 
UCO3001 induction and maintenance studies in subjects with UC were the same as those that were being 
studied in the Phase 3 program for ustekinumab in subjects with Crohn’s disease. Evaluating the same 
ustekinumab dose regimens in both diseases was considered reasonable by the CHMP given the 
similarities in the genetics and biology of UC and Crohn’s disease. 
Efficacy induction 
In the induction study, a total of 961 patients were randomized to either placebo (319), ustekinumab 130 
mg IV (320) or ustekinumab 5 mg/kg IV (322). There were no apparent imbalances between treatment 
groups apart from a slightly higher baseline fecal calprotectin in patients treated with ustekinumab 
compared to placebo. If a bias was introduced by this, it would be in favour of placebo. Thus, this 
imbalance is unlikely to have had major impact on the conclusions of the study.  
The study population consisted of approximately 50% extensive disease and 50 % left sided disease. 
There was a nearly even distribution of biologic naïve and biologic experienced patients. Patients included 
had moderate to severe disease activity reflected by a relatively high median Mayo score of 9 and a 
median fecal calprotectin of 1200-1500 mg/kg. Approximately 90 % had a fecal calprotectin above 250 
mg/kg. In terms of baseline characteristics and disease activity, the included patients are considered 
representative of intended target population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 101/161 
 
 
 
The majority of the included patients had failed or were intolerant to standard therapy (including steroids 
and immunosuppressant) and/or biologics. In terms of baseline concomitant medication and previous 
medication history, the included patients are considered representative of intended target population. 
 In terms of concomitant medication and previous medication history, the treatment groups are well 
balanced. There are no important imbalances. 
Compared to placebo (5.3 %), both doses of ustekinumab (15.6% and 15.3 % for 130 mg and 6 mg/kg, 
respectively) significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission (defined as 
Mayo score ≤2 points, with no individual subscore > 1). There were slightly more patients in the placebo 
group than in the two ustekinumab groups who were defined as treatment failures due to use of 
prohibited medication or missing of all Mayo scores. In theory, this could favour ustekinumab over 
placebo. However, in a long row of sensitivity analyses, including a worst case scenario analysis (subjects 
who received placebo, had missing data at Week 8, and did not have an event of treatment failure prior 
to Week 8 were considered to be in clinical remission. Subjects who received ustekinumab and had 
missing data at Week 8 were considered not to be in clinical remission) ustekinumab was consistently 
statistically superior to placebo. This supports the statistical robustness of the results.  
Analyses in various clinically relevant subgroups demonstrated that efficacy was maintained across these. 
In particular efficacy was maintained irrespective of whether the subjects received concomitant 5-ASA, 
oral corticosteroid, AZA/MP/MTX. Efficacy was also independent of previous medication history (e.g. 
biologic failure y/n).  
As regards the clinical relevance, the difference between placebo and ustekinumab in terms of fraction of 
patients achieving clinical remission (approximately 10 percentage points for both doses) appears 
modest at first glance. However, it has to be acknowledged that achieving clinical remission defined as 
above within 8 weeks is a very demanding endpoint. It also has to be acknowledged that in previous 
applications for similar indications, the less demanding endpoint of response was used. This has to taken 
into consideration when comparing results across studies.  
Considering the very demanding endpoint and the early assessment, the observed difference is 
considered clinically relevant.  
As regards the major secondary endpoint “endoscopic remission”, both doses of ustekinumab 
significantly increased the fraction of patients achieving the endpoint (26.3% and 27.0 % for 130 mg and 
6 mg/kg respectively) compared to placebo (13.8%). Superiority above placebo was achieved at an early 
time point and the difference in terms of remission rates are considered clinically relevant. 
Compared to placebo, both doses of ustekinumab significantly increased the fraction of patients achieving 
clinical response (major secondary endpoint) defined in an identical way to what was used in the pivotal 
studies of infliximab in UC (51.3%, 61.8% and 31.3% for ustekinumab 130 mg, ustekinumab 6 mg/kg 
and placebo, respectively). Notwithstanding the many caveats associated with cross trial comparisons, 
the effect size for the highest dose of ustekinumab (6 mg/kg) was numerically comparable to what was 
achieved with infliximab (5 or 10 mg/kg) in the ACT1 and ACT2 studies. This further supports the 
conclusion on the clinical relevance of the observed effect size. 
Albeit a secondary endpoint without correction for multiplicity, symptomatic remission (defined at a Mayo 
stool frequency of 0 or 1 and a rectal bleeding score of 0) is considered of major interest as according to 
current relevant EU guideline, this should have been a co-primary endpoint. It is noted that both doses of 
ustekinumab, compared to placebo, significantly increased the fraction of patients achieving symptomatic 
remission. Thus significantly greater proportions of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups 
achieved symptomatic remission (44.7% and 41.3%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo 
group (22.6%; p<0.001 for both comparisons). The difference is considered clinically relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 102/161 
 
 
 
Thus while not formally defined as co-primary endpoints as suggested by the current EU guideline, the 
Applicant has indeed demonstrated clinically and statistically significant effects on both endoscopic and 
symptomatic remission. 
As expected, compared to patients not having failed biologics, patients who had a history of failing 
biologic treatment had a numerically smaller effect size both in term of response and remission rates. 
However, the effect remained statistically and clinically significant. Notwithstanding the serious 
uncertainties associated with cross study comparisons, it is noted that response rates were comparable to 
what has been observed for other biologics.  
Elevated CRP is not present in all cases of active UC. This was also reflected in the study population where 
40.8% had normal CRP levels. This is considered acceptable and representative for the target population. 
Among patients with elevated CRP, the rate of normalisation was significantly greater in the ustekinumab 
treated patients than in placebo treated patients. Furthermore, faecal calprotectin was significantly 
reduced by ustekinumab. Both effects are considered supportive evidence of the biologic effect of the 
drug in UC. Subjects not achieving response/remission at week 8 were given open label ustekinumab (~6 
mg/kg (to patients having received placebo at week 0) and 90 mg (to patients having received either 130 
mg or ~6 mg/kg at week 0). Among patients treated with placebo at week 0 and ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg 
at week given at week 8, the effect at week 16 was, as expected similar to what was observed at week 8 
for patients receiving ~6 mg/kg at week 0. This does not provide any new information.  
Ustekinumab treated patients who were not in response at week 8 of UNIFI-I received an administration 
of 90 mg SC ustekinumab at week 8 (36% of patients). Of those patients, 9% of patients who were 
initially randomized to the recommended induction dose achieved clinical remission and 58% achieved 
clinical response at Week 16. Patients who were not in clinical response to ustekinumab induction at week 
8 of the UNFI-I study but were in response at week 16 (157 patients) entered into the non-randomized 
portion of UNIFI-M and continued to receive maintenance dosing every 8 weeks; among these patients, 
a majority (62%) maintained response and 30% achieved remission at week 44. This information is in the 
SmPC. 
Efficacy maintenance 
A total of 783 patients were included in the maintenance study. Only 523 of these were randomised 
(constituting the primary efficacy population). The rest (260 patients) were non randomised patients 
receiving open label ustekinumab. Among the randomised patients, 175 received placebo, 172 received 
ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and 176 patients received ustekinumab 90 mg q8w. In the placebo group 43 
patients discontinued study agent whereas the corresponding figures for the ustekinumab groups were 24 
and 18, respectively. The total number of discontinuations were almost twice as high in the placebo arm 
as in the two ustekinumab arms combined. The difference was primarily due to (expectedly) higher 
discontinuations rates in the placebo arm due to lack of efficacy, worsening of UC and failure to achieve 
partial Mayo response at week 16 (all of which are linked to the lack of effect of placebo). As such this is 
not unexpected.  
Patients discontinuing treatment were considered non-responders. The applicant provided evidence of 
worsening UC disease activity among the majority of subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE 
of worsening UC or lack of efficacy across the different treatment groups which justifies treating these 
subjects as non-responders in the efficacy analyses. 
Generally, the treatment groups were well balanced in terms of demographic characteristics, disease 
characteristics and concomitant therapies. In general, no clinically relevant imbalances were observed. 
However, the inflammatory burden, as judged by fecal calprotectin, was slightly higher in the

ustekinumab than in the placebo group. The difference is of doubtful relevance and in any instance not in 
favor to the test drug and as such not inducing any bias in favor of the test drug. 
Compared to placebo, both doses of ustekinumab statistically significantly increased the fraction of 
patients who maintained clinical remission. The difference between placebo and both doses of 
ustekinumab was considered clinically relevant. Remission rates were numerically higher in the 
ustekinumab q8 group compared to the ustekinumab q12 group. No formal statistical comparison was 
reported. 
The number of patients missing one or more Mayo subscores at week 44 was considerably higher in the 
placebo group compared to the two ustekinumab groups. However, this was almost entirely due to 
patients having discontinued study agent prior to week 40. Furthermore, among the patients with all four 
Mayo scores missing, the difference between placebo and ustekinumab groups were entirely due to the 
expected differences in term of discontinuations due to treatment failure. Thus, it is concluded that the 
differences in missing information is unlikely to have confounded the observed results. 
Compared to placebo, both doses of ustekinumab statistically significantly increased the fraction of 
patients who maintained clinical remission. The difference between placebo and both doses of 
ustekinumab was considered clinically relevant. Remission rates were numerically higher in the 
ustekinumab q8 group compared to the ustekinumab q12 group. No formal statistical comparison was 
reported. 
As expected the number of patients experiencing treatment failure were higher in the placebo group 
compared to the ustekinumab group (please refer to the section on statistical methods).  
Compared to placebo, both doses of ustekinumab statistically and clinically significantly increased the 
number of subjects achieving the primary endpoint (clinical remission (global definition)) (24.0%, 38.4% 
and 43.8% for placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and ustekinumab q8w, respectively).  
The effect was maintained in both biologic naïve and experienced patients. However, as expected the 
effect size was numerically smaller in the treatment-experienced patients. There was a trend for better 
efficacy of q8 than q12 in treatment-experienced patients. 
For the very treatment resistant patients (failing both anti-TNF and vedolizumab), treatment benefit was 
small and not statistically persuasive. Point estimates of beneficial treatment effect over placebo were 
however consistent across strata including patients failing both anti-TNF and vedolizumab. The 
maintenance study was underpowered to demonstrate the benefit persuasively in this subgroup. 
 It is acknowledged that the numbers of patients in these groups are small and that the study was not 
powered to demonstrate statistically significant results in this subpopulation. Nevertheless, it is likely that 
ustekinumab will be used extensively in patients who have failed biologics including patients failing both 
TNF inhibitors and integrin inhibitors. Thus, the Applicant included the relevant data on these patients into 
5.1 of the SmPC (at week 8 and at week 52 from initiation of the induction dose) to alert prescribers to the 
limited evidence of efficacy in this subpopulation. 
In order to support a claim for efficacy in UC, the drug is expected to have an effect on both symptoms 
and endoscopic appearance of the mucosa. As outlined in the current guideline, the (co)primary 
endpoints should be proportion of patients in symptomatic remission and proportion of patients with 
endoscopic remission (for the maintenance studies this should be achieved without steroids, i.e. steroid 
free symptomatic and endoscopic remission). Thus, the use of clinical remission defined as a total Mayo 
score (which includes both symptoms, endoscopic appearance and physician’s global impression) below 
or equal to 2 (with no subscores above 1) is not in accordance with the current guideline. Furthermore, 
the primary endpoint used does not exclude the use of steroids.  
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 104/161 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding these remarks, it is noted that the study was designed and conducted prior to the release 
of the current version of the EU guideline. Furthermore, the results of the secondary endpoint (please see 
below) does indicate that ustekinumab has an effect on both symptomatic and endoscopic remission. 
Finally, the US definition of the primary endpoint (for which a statistically and clinically significant effect 
also was demonstrated), i.e. patients achieving both clinical and symptomatic response, does indicate 
that ustekinumab has an effect on both parameters 
The results appear statistically robust as a number of sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis. 
Even the “worst case scenario” analyses did provide some support as significance was maintained in the 
q8 ustekinumab group and significance was borderline (p=0.055) in the q12 ustekinumab. Taken 
together these results supports the robustness of the primary analysis. 
The major secondary endpoints all supported the primary endpoint. Compared to placebo, ustekinumab 
statistically and clinically significant increased the number of patients achieving, maintenance of clinical 
response, endoscopic healing, corticosteroid free remission and maintenance of clinical remission through 
week 44. The analyses of these endpoints were done in hierarchical way maintaining the overall p value 
below 0.05. As previously mentioned, these major secondary endpoints, in combination with the US 
defined primary endpoint, are considered to support that ustekinumab has efficacy in the two domains 
(symptoms and endoscopy) requested by the current EU guideline. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of utekinumab has been adequately demonstrated in both the induction and maintenance 
pivotal studies. Superior efficacy over placebo has been demonstrated in subjects for the primary and key 
secondary outcomes in subjects who were biological and non-biological failures. Efficacy has been 
demonstrated in biological failures in terms of patients failing either anti-TNF agents or vedolizumab. The 
company have applied for the following indication ‘Extension of Indication for Stelara to include treatment 
of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic or have 
medical contraindications to such therapies’.  During the procedure, the CHMP noted that efficacy in 
severely treatment refractory patients (i.e. refractory to both TNF-inhibitors and vedolizumab)  was 
based on small numbers of and the study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant results 
in this subpopulation. As it is likely that ustekinumab will be used extensively in patients who have failed 
biologics including patients failing both TNF inhibitors and integrin inhibitors the MAH agreed at the 
CHMP’s request to add in Section 5.1 of the SmPC at statement to inform  prescribers about  the limited 
evidence of efficacy in this subpopulation.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Ustekinumab was first authorised in the EU in 2009 for the indication of plaque psoriasis. Since that 
original licence, extensions to the indication include psoriatic arthropathy, paediatric plaque psoriasis in 
subjects aged 12yrs and older and most recently moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in 
patients who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a TNFα antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies. 
The most common adverse reactions (> 5%) in controlled periods of the adult psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis 
and Crohn’s disease clinical studies with ustekinumab were nasopharyngitis and headache. Based on the 
postmarketing safety surveillance, hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and urticaria), serious 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), lower respiratory tract infection, 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 105/161 
 
 
 
allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, erythrodermic psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis, were 
identified as ADRs.  
Serious infections (including mycobacterial and salmonella infections) and malignancies represent 
important potential risks due to the mechanism of action. Current post-marketing registries for patients 
with moderate to severe psoriasis and Crohn’s disease aim to further characterise long term safety for 
these indications. 
The clinical development program for ustekinumab in UC consisted of a placebo-controlled induction 
study and a randomised-withdrawal maintenance study, conducted under a single protocol.  
The safety data for UC were presented and analysed separately for: 
• 
• 
The placebo-controlled induction period (ie, Week 0 to Week 8 of induction and the final safety 
visit) in treated subjects. 
The maintenance phase of treatment (Week 0 of maintenance up to week 44). 
•  Combined induction and maintenance phase of treatment, to assess the overall safety experience 
from induction though maintenance, representing a total of up to 52 weeks of exposure (8 weeks 
exposure in induction studies and 44 weeks exposure in the maintenance study). 
Supportive analyses were also presented including: 
•  An analysis of the placebo-controlled induction period and Week 0 through Week 44 of the 
maintenance studies from the pooled Phase 3 IBD (UC and Crohn’s disease induction and 
maintenance studies) population 
•  An analysis of global pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 safety data across diseases (IBD [UC and 
Crohn’s disease] and psoriatic diseases [psoriasis and PsA]), and a range of doses, for all treated 
subjects analyzed separately for the placebo-controlled period and through approximately 1 year 
of treatment.  
Safety was evaluated via descriptive statistics, counts and percentages (subject incidence, numbers of 
events and numbers of subjects with events both per 100 subject-years of follow-up). All subjects who 
receive at least 1 administration of study agent were included in the Safety Analysis Set (including 
randomised and non-randomised patients).  
The following treatment emergent safety parameters were analysed by treatment group: adverse 
reactions (AEs), serious adverse reactions (SAEs), reasonably-related AEs (any event with an 
investigator-assigned relationship to study agent of ‘Very Likely’, ‘Probable’, or ‘Possible’ or if the 
relationship to study agent is missing), discontinuations of study agent due to AEs, deaths, infections, 
serious infections, treated infections, AEs within 1 hour of infusion and injection-site reactions. Analysis of 
laboratory evaluations, vital signs and safety in special groups was also presented. 
Protocol specified events of special interest included any newly identified malignancy or case of active TB 
occurring after the first administration of study agent. The targeted AEs of serious infections, TB, 
malignancies, and serious MACE were analysed for the UC safety data set and compared across the IBD 
and approved psoriatic diseases populations. In addition, targeted AEs that occurred infrequently 
(anaphylactic and delayed hypersensitivity [serum sickness-like] reactions, TB and opportunistic 
infections, and serious neurological disorders) are also described. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate whether demographic characteristics, UC disease 
characteristics, concomitant UC medication, or UC medication history factors had a differential effect on 
safety in subjects with UC.

Patient exposure 
Patient exposure - Induction study 
In the Phase 3 UC induction study, a total of 641 subjects received a single IV induction dose of 
ustekinumab at Week 0; 321 subjects received IV ustekinumab 130 mg and 320 subjects received IV 
ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg. The average length of follow-up was 8, 8.1 and 8.2 weeks for the placebo, the 
130 mg and ~6 mg/kg treatment groups through week 8 and 8.7, 8.6 and 8.6 weeks through the final 
safety visit. 
Patient exposure – Maintenance phase 
The safety database from the two Phase 3 Ulcerative Colitis clinical studies (UCO3001 induction and 
maintenance studies) comprises 825 ustekinumab-treated subjects. All 825 subjects received a single IV 
dose of ustekinumab.  
Subjects in whom the duration between the first and last ustekinumab administration was at least 14 
weeks were counted as having 6 months of exposure, and subjects in whom the duration between the 
first and last ustekinumab administration was at least 38 weeks (accounting for 2-week visit windows) 
were counted as having 1 year of exposure. This definition of exposure was used in submissions 
supporting the psoriatic disease indications and was also subsequently applied for the Crohn’s disease 
submission. A total of 491 (59.5%) subjects were exposed to ustekinumab (IV and SC) for at least 6 
months and 442 (53.6%) subjects were exposed to ustekinumab (IV and SC) for at least 1 year, with a 
total of 250 subject-years of follow up, as summarised in the following table:

Adverse events 
Adverse events - Induction study 
Through Week 8, 50.0%, 41.4%, and 48.0% of subjects had 1 or more AEs in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events in the Infections and infestations, and Gastrointestinal (GI) 
disorders SOCs were most frequently reported. The most frequently reported AE in the Infections and 
infestations SOC was viral upper respiratory tract infection (5.0%, 4.0% and 2.5% in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 
mg and placebo groups, respectively). In the GI disorders SOC, the most frequently reported AEs were 
ulcerative colitis (2.2%, 2.8%, and 5.6% of subjects, respectively), nausea (2.2%, 2.5%, 1.9% of 
subjects, respectively), and abdominal pain (1.9%, 2.5%, 2.2% of subjects, respectively).

For analyses of all data through the final safety visit (20 weeks after the last administration of study 
agent), a subject with an AE was counted in a group based on the study agent the subject was receiving 
at the time of onset of the event and therefore may be counted in more than 1 column in a table.

Infection and infestation SOC (4.4% and 2.5% in the combined ustekinumab IV group and placebo group, 
respectively). Within the GI disorders SOC, ulcerative colitis was the most frequently reported AE (2.8% 
and 5.6% in the combined ustekinumab IV group and placebo group, respectively). 
Overall, through the final safety visit, the 2 most frequently reported AEs were headache (4.5% and 4.4% 
in the combined ustekinumab IV group and placebo group, respectively) and viral upper respiratory 
infection (4.4% and 2.5% in the combined ustekinumab IV group and placebo group, respectively. 
Adverse events – Maintenance study 
The company conducted analyses of safety in the maintenance study for the primary population (ie, 
subjects who were in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction and were randomised in the 
maintenance study).  Safety data for subjects who were not in the randomized primary population in 
UCO3001, including responders to placebo IV induction and delayed responders (ie, subjects who were 
not in clinical response to ustekinumab at Week 8 of induction but were in clinical response at Week 16 of 
induction after a SC administration of ustekinumab at Week 8 of the induction study), were summarised 
separately.  
In the maintenance phase the proportions of subjects experiencing a treatment emergent AEs was 
comparable amongst groups. There was no evidence of a dose effect between the 2 ustekinumab dose 
groups (78.9% of patients experienced a TEAE in the placebo group versus 69.2% in the ustekinumab 90 
mg SC q12w group, and 77.3% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w group). 
The SOCs with the highest proportions of AEs in the combined ustekinumab group during maintenance 
were Infections and Infestations (48.9% of subjects in the placebo group and 46.8% of subjects in the 
combined ustekinumab group) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (47.4% of subjects in the placebo group 
and 39.2% of subjects in the combined ustekinumab group).  
Of the 523 subjects who were randomised at maintenance Week 0 and received at least 1 administration 
of study agent, 1 or more AEs was reported through Week 44 for 77.3%, 69.2%, and 78.9% of subjects 
in the ustekinumab q8w, ustekinumab q12w, and placebo groups, respectively as summarised in the 
following table:

Sinusitis  
A new non-serious ADR of sinusitis (with a frequency of common [≥1/100 and <1/10]) has been 
proposed for inclusion in section 4.8 of the SmPC by the company. 
Sinusitis - Induction study 
Sinusitis occurred in 1 (0.3%), 5 (1.6%), and 1 (0.3%) of subjects in the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg, 
ustekinumab 130 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
Sinusitis - Maintenance study 
During the placebo controlled period of the UCO3001 maintenance study, sinusitis was reported in 7 
(4.0%), 2 (1.2%), and 2 (1.1%) subjects in the ustekinumab q8w, ustekinumab q12w, and placebo 
groups, respectively, equating to approximate 4.5-fold increase in the number of subjects reporting 
sinusitis in the combined ustekinumab-treated group (9 subjects) compared with the placebo group (2 
subjects). When evaluated in conjunction with Crohn’s disease data alone, and in the context of pooled 
Phase 3 IBD data, as well as pooled results inclusive of psoriatic disease, a less pronounced though similar 
trend is observed.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Through Week 8, 3.1%, 3.7%, and 6.6% of subjects reported 1 or more SAEs in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 mg, 
and placebo groups, respectively. Serious AEs in the GI disorders SOC were the most frequently reported 
(1.6%, 1.2% and 4.1% in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg and placebo groups, respectively). Ulcerative colitis 
was the most frequently reported SAE in this SOC (0.9%, 1.2% and 3.4%, respectively). Except for 
ulcerative colitis, most SAEs were reported for only 1 subject each with the exception of the following 
SAEs that were reported for 2 subjects each of hyperventilation (2 subjects in the 130 mg group) and 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT, 2 subjects in the ~6 mg/kg group) 
Through the final safety visit, 3.6% of subjects in the combined ustekinumab IV group and 6.9% of 
subjects in the placebo group reported SAEs. In both groups, the most frequently reported SAEs were in 
the GI disorders SOC (1.8% and 4.1%, respectively); ulcerative colitis was the most frequently reported 
SAE in this SOC (1.6% and 3.4%, respectively).

Of note, there was 1 reported SAE of pulmonary embolism (though no reports of deep venous 
thrombosis) in the UCO3001 maintenance study through Week 44. 
• 
Pulmonary embolism (1 subject in the ustekinumab q12w group) – Bilateral pulmonary artery 
embolism complicated by pulmonary infarction was reported on Day 229 post first administration. 
The subject had a prior history of brachial artery thrombosis, thrombophilia-heterozygous form of 
MTHFR gene mutation, ulcerative haemorrhagic retrocolitis and severe iron-deficiency anaemia.  
Deaths – Induction study 
There was 1 death reported through the final safety visit; a subject in the ~6 mg/kg group experienced 
sudden death on Study Day 42 attributed to an SAE of oesophageal varices haemorrhage. The event was 
considered not to be related to study agent by the investigator. The subject had no reported history of 
portal hypertension or cirrhosis.  
Deaths – Maintenance study 
There was 1 death prior to Week 44 of the maintenance study in a subject who was in the ustekinumab 
induction delayed-responder group (receiving ustekinumab q8w). The death (maintenance Day 85) was 
attributed to acute respiratory failure that occurred during thyroid surgery for a multinodular goiter. The 
event was considered to be unrelated to study agent by the investigator.  
The sponsor also highlights an additional death that occurred during the ongoing LTE (after maintenance 
Week 44) in an elderly subject with multiple comorbidities died on Day 573 post first administration of 
study agent; the death was attributed to failure to thrive. The subject received placebo IV at Week 0 of 
induction followed by ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV at Week 8 of induction and was randomized to the 
placebo group at Week 0 of maintenance. The patient received ustekinumab 90 mg (receiving only 1 
dose) approximately 10 days prior to hospitalisation for diarrhoea secondary to ulcerative colitis, 
complicated by CMV colitis. However the initial event of diarrhoea had been reported 10 days prior to the 
second dose of ustekinumab. The patient was discharged but eventually readmitted with a lumbar 
compression fracture and was continuing to have active diarrhoea with blood. The subject eventually died 
573 days after first administration of the study agent. Death was attributed to failure to thrive.  
Serious Infections, including TB and Opportunistic infections – Induction study 
Through Week 8, a total of 7 subjects had 1 or more serious infection as identified by the investigator 
(0.3% [1 subject], 0.6% [2 subjects], and 1.3% [4 subjects] in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 mg, and placebo 
groups, respectively). 
No cases of active TB were reported through the final safety visit.  
The only serious infection that was reported in the ~6 mg/kg group was pyoderma gangrenosum (which 
the investigator designated as an infection on the eCRF). The only serious infections that were reported 
in the 130 mg group were gastroenteritis and pneumonia (reported by 1 subject ach).  
A life threatening opportunistic infection of legionella pneumonia was reported for a subject in the placebo 
→ ~6 mg/kg group. At the time of the event the subject was receiving concomitant therapy with 
methylprednisolone (8 mg daily). The subject was hospitalised with dyspnea and tachypnea 
approximately 4 weeks after her first dose of ustekinumab at week 8 and transferred to ICU the next day 
due to respiratory insufficiency which required intubation and artificial ventilation. Following extended 
hospitalisation the patient recovered with sequelae from the event; which considered very likely related 
to study agent by the investigator.  
Through the final safety visit, 0.7% and 1.6 % of subjects in the combined ustekinumab IV group and 
placebo group, respectively, reported at least 1 serious infection. Serious infections of pneumonia were

reported for 2 subjects in the combined ustekinumab IV group (no subjects in the placebo group reported 
pneumonia). The remaining serious infections were reported for no more than 1 subject each. 
Serious infections, including TB and Opportunistic infections - Maintenance study 
Among randomised subjects, serious AEs of infection were reported in 3 (1.7%), 6 (3.5%), and 4 (2.3%) 
subjects in the ustekinumab q8w, ustekinumab q12w, and placebo groups, respectively.  
No cases of active TB were reported among ustekinumab-treated subjects through Week 44. 
Opportunistic infections were identified in 3 subjects (all in the randomised population).  
There were two cases of CMV colitis. Both events were of moderate intensity and resulted in 
hospitalization. There was also a case of ophthalmic and oral herpes simplex in a patient who was not 
receiving concomitant corticosteroid or immunomodulator therapy at the time of the event. 
Possible Anaphylactic and Possible Delayed Hypersensitivity (Serum Sickness-Like) 
Reactions –Induction study 
Through the final safety visit, 1 SAE of anaphylactic reaction in the placebo group occurred on Study Day 
1; this event occurred within minutes of starting the infusion, and resulted in the subject being 
terminated from study participation. There were no cases of delayed hypersensitivity or serum 
sickness-like reaction through the final safety visit.  
Possible Anaphylactic and Possible Delayed Hypersensitivity (Serum Sickness-Like) 
Reactions –Maintenance study 
There were no cases of anaphylactic or delayed hypersensitivity reactions reported through Week 44 
Malignancies – Induction Study 
No malignancies were reported through Week 8. However, through the final safety visit,2 malignancies 
(both SAEs) of prostate cancer and rectal adenocarcinoma were reported for 1 subject each, in the 130 
mg IV → 90 mg SC group. 
Malignancies – Maintenance Study 
Seven subjects in the treatment group versus 1 in the placebo group developed malignancy. Most of 
these malignancies were diagnosed within 6 months of study treatment. The standardised incidence 
ratios (excluding in situ cervical cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer) using epidemiological data from 
the SEER database, adjusting for age and race, is presented to place these occurrences into context of 
what might be expected for the population. The SIR obtained is 1.7 for UC which is almost three times the 
SIRs obtained for previous indications.  
Cardiovascular events – Induction study 
No serious cases of MACE (ie, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) 
were reported for ustekinumab-treated subjects through the final safety visit. Through Week 8, there was 
1 SAE of ischemic stroke reported for 1 subject in the placebo group. 
Cardiovascular events – Maintenance study 
There were two reports of serious MACE (ie, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and 
cardiovascular death) in the maintenance study: 
•  A case of nonfatal cardiac arrest in a 45 year old male patient (maintenance Day 143; 199 days 
after last dose of ustekinumab [during induction study]) in the perioperative period following a

total laparoscopic coloproctocoletomy with ileostomy; the subject was successfully resuscitated. 
The subject had a medical history of essential hypertension and ischemic heart disease. 
•  A postoperative anterior wall myocardial infarction in a following a thyroid surgery complicated by 
acute respiratory failure in a 54 year old male patient who died of complications of ARDS that 
began with acute respiratory failure (discussed above in Deaths). 
Overall, up to 1 year, there is no consistent evidence that ustekinumab increases cardiovascular risk. 
Immunogenicity – Induction study 
Of the 822 subjects who received ustekinumab at any time through the final safety visit, and who had 
appropriate samples for the assessment of anti-drug antibodies, 18 subjects (2.2%) were positive for 
antibodies to ustekinumab from Week 0 through the final safety visit with subject peak titers ranging from 
1:100 to 1:3200. This included 1 subject in the placebo group tested positive for antibodies to 
ustekinumab at Week 0. Of these 18 subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab, 15 were 
evaluable for NAbs. Of these 15 subjects, 4 (26.7%) were positive for NAbs through the final safety visit. 
Immunogenicity – Maintenance study 
Among 680 treated subjects with appropriate samples for the assessment of antibodies to ustekinumab, 
39 (5.7%) were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab through 52 weeks of treatment, the majority with 
antibody titers ≤1:800. Of the 39 treated subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab in this 
maintenance study, 11 (28.2%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).  
Among randomized subjects in this maintenance study, the incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was 
similar among subjects in the ustekinumab q8w and q12w groups (3.4% and 3.5%, respectively) but 
higher among subjects in the placebo group (9.1%). During the UCO3001 maintenance study, none of the 
subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab through Week 44 reported an injection-site 
reaction.

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory findings- Induction phase 
At baseline, haematology values were generally similar across all treatment groups. Changes in selected 
haematology values through Week 8 were consistent with the decrease in inflammatory disease activity 
observed in the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg groups; namely, increases in median haemoglobin and 
haematocrit values, and small decreases in median WBC and neutrophils were noted. 
At baseline, chemistry values were generally similar across all treatment groups. Through Week 8, except 
for serum albumin which was increased in both ustekinumab groups compared with placebo, changes in 
chemistry values did not appear to be clinically important. As was observed for selected hematologic 
parameters, the observed increase in serum albumin is consistent with a decrease in inflammatory 
activity with ustekinumab treatment. 
Laboratory finding – Maintenance phase 
Haematology and clinical chemistry results were comparable among treatment groups and no trends 
were observed indicating an association between ustekinumab and changes in routine laboratory 
parameters. 
No clinically relevant changes in vital signs were reported during the study.

Pregnancy – Induction phase 
Through the final safety visit, 2 pregnancies were reported (1 female subject in the ~6 mg/kg group and 
another in the 130 mg group). Both pregnancies resulted in the delivery of healthy newborns. 
Pregnancy – Maintenance phase 
There were 6 pregnancies in reported through to week 44 (2 subject pregnancies in the q8w group,1 
subject pregnancy and 1 partner pregnancy in the ustekinumab q12w group, 1 subject pregnancy from 
the placebo group (received IV ustekinumab during induction), and 1 partner pregnancy in the 
ustekinumab induction delayed-responder group (received ustekinumab q8w during maintenance). There 
were 2 first trimester miscarriages in the q8w group pregnancies. One of the mothers had a previous 
healthy pregnancy and no identified risk factors and the second mother is noted to have heterozygous 
factor v leiden mutation and three previous pregnancies (a spontaneous abortion, live birth at 24 weeks 
and stillborn at 28 weeks)). 
The remaining 4 pregnancies resulted in healthy newborns. 
Pregnancies across ustekinumab studies: 
As of 31 August 2018, 154 reports of pregnancy were identified in studies of ustekinumab in UC, Crohn’s 
disease, psoriasis, PsA, MS, ankylosing spondylitis, and healthy volunteers: 
81 maternal pregnancies and 73 pregnancies with paternal exposure.  
In general, the outcomes seen in the ustekinumab pregnancies are comparable with what is expected in 
the general population.

Elderly – Induction phase 
During the induction study, within the ≥65 years of age population, there appeared to be an increase in 
the proportions of ustekinumab-treated subjects reporting AEs, SAEs, and infections compared with 
placebo-treated subjects (ie, for AEs 21 [61.8%] and 5 [31.3%] subjects with 1 or more AEs, for the 
ustekinumab and placebo groups respectively, for SAEs 2 [5.9%] and 0 subjects with 1 or more AEs for 
the ustekinumab and placebo groups respectively, and for infections 9 [26.5%] and 0 subjects with 1 or 
more infections for the ustekinumab and placebo groups respectively); this pattern was not observed in 
the <65 years of age population. On review of the specific events, the most frequent AEs and infections 
in the ≥65 years of age group involved the upper respiratory tract (ie, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory 
tract infection, sinusitis, and pharyngitis) which is consistent with the overall population. Several of these 
AEs (ie, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections) are established ADRs while sinusitis is a 
newly identified ADR in the overall population. All AEs were reported as mild events and generally 
resolved without treatment. Two ustekinumab-treated subjects reported SAEs; 1 subject reported 3 
concurrent SAEs (ie, aphasia, cognitive disorder, and motor dysfunction) and the second subject reported 
1 SAE of ulcerative colitis. However, given the low number of subjects in the ≥65 years of age 
subpopulation, particularly in the placebo group, and some imbalances in concomitant 
immunomodulators use between the treatment groups, definitive conclusions of the impact of 
ustekinumab on the risk of AEs and infections in elderly patients cannot be drawn.

Elderly - Maintenance study  
Unlike the observations from the induction study, no trends were observed with regards to differences in 
the event rates per 100 subject-years for AEs, SAEs, infections, or discontinuations of study agent due to 
AEs, when evaluated according to the subject’s age during the maintenance study. While it is 
acknowledged that the numbers are very low, it is noted that the proportion of patients discontinuing due 
to TAES in the maintenance phase is larger (3% in those <65 years versus 20% in those >65 years – as 
illustrated in the table above.   
Sex, Race, Weight 
The company state that no trends were observed with regards to differences in the proportions of subjects 
reporting AEs, SAEs, or infections, when evaluated according to the subject’s sex, race or weight during 
the induction study. 
The number of TEAEs up to 44 weeks per 100 Subject-years of follow-up by demographic factors in 
patients randomised in the maintenance study is presented in the following table:

Disease severity 
Overall, the safety profile of ustekinumab was not affected by UC disease severity. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The sponsor has not performed any specific drug-drug interactions however no new drug-drug 
interactions are expected based on the proposed new indication. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to adverse events – Induction study 
Study agent was administered as a single IV infusion at Week 0; therefore, subjects could not be 
discontinued from further study agent administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019  
Page 133/161 
 
 
 
 
Discontinuation due to adverse events – Maintenance study 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study agent in randomised patients were reported in 5 
(2.8%), 9 (5.2%), and 20 (11.4%) subjects in the ustekinumab q8w, ustekinumab q12w, and placebo 
groups, respectively. 
Ulcerative colitis was the most frequently reported AE that resulted in discontinuation of study agent 
among randomized subjects, in 15 (8.6%) subjects in the placebo group, 4 (2.3%) subjects in the q12w 
group, and none in the q8w group. 
Pooled analysis 
There are pathophysiologic similarities between UC and Crohn’s disease (an approved ustekinumab 
indication). Furthermore, medications used to treat UC are generally similar to those used to treat Crohn’s 
disease. In addition, other approved biologics typically use a similar posology for the treatment of Crohn’s 
disease and UC. Because of these considerations, the same induction and maintenance dose regimens 
were used in the Phase 3 studies in UC and Crohn’s disease. Also of note, the UC and Crohn’s disease 
programs employed a similar design strategy of placebo controlled induction and randomized-withdrawal 
maintenance Phase 3 studies and had similar target populations. Therefore, the pooling of the data from 
the Phase 3 UC and Crohn’s disease studies into the pooled Phase 3 IBD population is appropriate and will 
increase the power to identify safety signals. 
Only the Phase 3 Crohn’s disease studies were included in these assessments, as it is the most rigorous 
analysis of the 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg doses. The Phase 2 Crohn’s disease studies (C0379T07 and 
C0743T26) were not included since they could introduce bias. Except for the ~6 mg/kg dose used in 
C0743T26, different doses were studied in C0379T07 and C0743T26 than were studied in the Phase 3 
Crohn’s disease studies. Furthermore, the ~6 mg/kg group in C0743T26 had a greater proportion of TNF 
antagonist refractory subjects than the Phase 3 Crohn’s disease studies as the study enrolled only TNF 
refractory subjects. 
Of note, the duration of follow-up in ustekinumab-treated subjects (ie, 90 mg SC q8w and 90 mg SC q12w 
combined) in the UCO3001 maintenance study was approximately 6 weeks longer than in the CRD3003 
maintenance study. Therefore, to allow for more informative comparisons, the primary presentations for 
the analyses of safety in the pooled Phase 3 IBD maintenance studies are subjects with events per 100 
subject-years of follow-up; supportive analyses of events per 100 subject-years and proportions of 
subjects with events are also provided. 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Pooled with Psoriatic Diseases 
Extensive clinical safety data supported the approval of ustekinumab for Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and 
PsA. Therefore, the safety experience of ustekinumab across the global Phase 2 and Phase 3 IBD studies 
(UC and Crohn’s disease) was assessed alongside the safety experience from the global Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 psoriatic diseases (psoriasis and PsA) studies, as well as all diseases pooled (IBD [UC and Crohn’s 
disease] and psoriatic diseases [psoriasis and PsA]), for both the placebo-controlled period and through 
approximately 1 year of treatment. 
A total of 6,709 subjects were treated with ustekinumab (2,574 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 IBD 
studies [825 subjects in the Phase 3 UC studies, 1,749 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 Crohn’s 
disease studies] and 4,135 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriatic diseases studies). Of these 6,709 
subjects, 4,577 subjects were exposed to ustekinumab (IV and SC) for at least 6 months and 2,540 
subjects were exposed to ustekinumab (IV and SC) for at least 1 year. 
Data on all diseases include results from the following trials:

Through 1 year of follow-up across all diseases pooled, a total of 6,709 subjects were treated with 
ustekinumab (2,574 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 IBD studies [825 subjects in the UC studies and 
1,749 subjects in the Crohn’s disease studies] and 4,135 subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriatic 
diseases studies [Table 14]) with a total of 5,149 subject-years of follow-up. Of these 6,709 subjects, 
4,577 subjects were exposed to ustekinumab (IV and SC) for at least 6 months and 2,540 subjects were 
exposed to ustekinumab (IV and SC) for at least 1 year. The mean (SD) total dose of ustekinumab in all 
diseases pooled was 350.7 mg (216.90 mg). Data are summarised in the following table:

For malignancies other than cervical cancer in situ and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), comparisons 
with an external database were conducted to determine whether event rates across indications were 
consistent with those rates expected for the general population. The National Institutes of Health 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2000-2010) was selected to estimate 
expected event rates of noncutaneous malignancies in the general US population adjusting for age, sex, 
and race. Selection of the SEER database was based on the ability of the database to identify the targeted 
events of interest. The SEER database contains information on over 3 million malignancies based upon 
population information from US census data, and malignancy data are collected and categorized in a 
manner that can be easily compared to the ustekinumab clinical study database. 
The company states that cervical cancers in situ and NMSCs are not included in the SEER database and, 
therefore, these malignancies were excluded from enumeration in this analysis. 
These comparisons are similar to those provided in previous submissions for the psoriasis and PsA 
indications

Post marketing experience 
Safety Surveillance 
Post marketing information has been accruing since the first approval of ustekinumab on 12 December 
2008. As of 31 December 2017, ustekinumab has received marketing authorization globally, including 
countries in North America, Europe, South America, and the Asia Pacific regions, for the treatment of adult 
and pediatric (age ≥12 to <18 years) patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adult 
patients with active PsA, and adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. 
The estimated cumulative global exposure to ustekinumab from launch through 31 December 2017 is 
1,036,701 person-years. The evaluation of postmarketing data is part of the Sponsor’s comprehensive 
safety surveillance program, which also includes review of data from ongoing clinical studies and registries. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports generated for ustekinumab reflect ongoing postmarketing safety 
surveillance as well as assessments of all important identified and potential risks. 
The cut-off date for postmarketing data in this SCS is 31 December 2017, which coincides with the most 
recent Periodic Safety Update Report cutoff date, and through this time period, 15 Periodic Safety Update 
Reports have been completed. Based on the postmarketing safety surveillance, hypersensitivity reactions 
(including rash and urticaria), serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), 
lower respiratory tract infection, allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, erythrodermic psoriasis, and 
pustular psoriasis, were identified as ADRs. 
Ustekinumab continues to have a favourable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of patients with moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis, PsA, and/or moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. 
The Sponsor will continue to monitor the safety profile of ustekinumab and report the safety findings as 
appropriate. 
Postmarketing Registries 
A Crohn’s disease postmarketing registry study (An observational postauthorization safety study to describe 
the safety of ustekinumab and other Crohn’s disease treatments in a cohort of patients with Crohn’s disease, 
RRA-20745), was initiated in the European Union in 2017. The objective of this study is to monitor the 
long-term safety profile of ustekinumab use in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease. Currently, minimal data has been collected in this registry. 
The most extensive post marketing registry data for ustekinumab are available from The Psoriasis 
Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR, C0168Z03), which is enrolling subjects with psoriasis 
treated with ustekinumab.

Two post marketing studies monitoring pregnancies in women exposed to ustekinumab are the Nordic 
Pregnancy Research Initiative [CNTO1275PSO4007] and the STELARA Pregnancy Exposure Registry-OTIS 
Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Project [CNTO1275PSO4037] 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database from the two Phase 3 Ulcerative Colitis clinical studies (UCO3001 induction and 
maintenance studies) comprises 825 ustekinumab-treated subjects. All 825 subjects received a single IV 
dose of ustekinumab. For the maintenance trial, the company uses the randomised population for primary 
analyses. This approach was also used for the analysis of safety data for the extension of indication in 
Crohn’s Disease .  
The most common adverse reactions (> 5%) in controlled periods of the adult psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis 
and Crohn’s disease clinical studies with ustekinumab were nasopharyngitis and headache. Based on the 
postmarketing safety surveillance, hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and urticaria), serious 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), lower respiratory tract infection, allergic 
alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, erythrodermic psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis, were identified as ADRs.  
Serious infections (including mycobacterial and salmonella infections) and malignancies represent important 
potential risks due to the mechanism of action. Current post-marketing registries for patients with moderate 
to severe psoriasis and Crohn’s disease aim to further characterise long term safety for these indications. 
Demographics of patients randomised with UC are broadly comparable to patients randomised with CD. 
Differences in terms of body weight (IBD patients had lower median body weight and a lower BMI than 
patients with psoriatic disease) as well as age (IBD patients were younger than patients with psoriatic 
disease) are consistent with the reported demographics of patients with UC and Crohn’s. Overall, no trends 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019

were observed with regards to differences in the proportions of subjects reporting AEs, SAEs, or infections, 
when evaluated according to the subject’s race or weight and the safety profile of ustekinumab was not 
affected by UC disease severity. 
No major safety issues were identified as part of those trials. 
Adverse events identified as related to exposure to Stelara (both intravenous and subcutaneous 
administrations) were consistent with known events described in the SmPC.  
The number of adverse events (high level descriptions) in both induction and maintenance study appear 
similar across all treatment groups. Through Week 8 of the induction phase, 50.0%, 41.4%, and 48.0% of 
subjects had 1 or more AEs in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Through the final 
safety visit of the induction phase, 42.4% of subjects in the combined ustekinumab IV group had 1 or more 
AEs compared with 48.0% of subjects in the placebo group. In the maintenance phase the proportions of 
subjects experiencing a treatment emergent AE was comparable amongst groups. Of the 523 subjects who 
were randomised at maintenance Week 0 and received at least 1 administration of study agent, 1 or more 
AEs were reported through Week 44 for 77.3%, 69.2%, and 78.9% of subjects in the ustekinumab q8w, 
ustekinumab q12w, and placebo groups, respectively. 
The company has identified a new non-serious ADR of sinusitis (with a frequency of common [≥1/100 and 
<1/10]) and this new ADR has been included in the SmPC.  
For SAEs, through Week 8 of the induction phase, 3.1%, 3.7%, and 6.6% of subjects reported 1 or more 
SAEs in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Through the final safety visit of the 
induction phase, 3.6% of subjects in the combined ustekinumab IV group and 6.9% of subjects in the 
placebo group reported SAEs. In randomised patients of the maintenance phase, serious AEs were reported 
in 8.5%, 7.6%, and 9.7% of subjects in the ustekinumab q8w, ustekinumab q12w, and placebo groups, 
respectively. Ulcerative colitis was the most commonly reported SAE across these randomized treatment 
groups, however in line with efficacy results, there was a decrease in the number of ustekinumab patients 
experiencing the SAE ulcerative colitis compared to placebo patients.  
Overall, the levels of AEs and SAEs per 100 subject-years are lower for ustekinumab compared to placebo 
treated patients with UC. This data follows a similar trend observed as for CD and psoriatic diseases as 
evident in the pooled analysis of all diseases in the ustekinumab clinical development programme. 
Two cases of DVTs occurred in the ~6 mg/kg group during the induction phase. Both cases were confounded, 
as was the PE which occurred in the maintenance study, though it is noted that a numerical increase in VTEs 
was also seen in the CD studies. The CHMP acknowledges that in the small number of VTE events reported 
in the CNTO1275UCO3001 clinical program, the occurrence appears to be sporadic with no clear relationship 
to the duration of ustekinumab exposure.  This important potential risk will be further monitored by means 
of a safety extension of trial CNTO1275UCO3001 (category 3 as described in the RMP) meant to generate 
further data on long-term safety (beyond 44 weeks with ustekinumab for maintenance treatment).  
Whilst the CHMP agrees with inclusion of the long-term extension study of CNTO1275UCO3001 as a required 
additional pharmacovigilance to further characterise long-term safety in patients with ulcerative colitis the 
committee takes due account that no other agents with activity against IL-12 or IL-23 are available for 
ulcerative colitis, and therefore there is no experience in this population with other similar agents over the 
long-term. Certain safety concerns could potentially have longer latencies, for example malignancy and 
some infections, such that they would not have been detected in this trial which is not powered to evaluate 
safety concerns of interest. Therefore the MAH agreed to perform also two adequately powered prospective 
observational PASSs (on ustekinumab treated patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with ulcerative 
colitis treated with other treatments) to further characterise the long-term safety of ustekinumab in 
ulcerative colitis. Further detail on the sample size of these studies and the exploration of ways of pooling the 
data will be provided when the protocols are submitted in April 2020.

One of the primary objectives for the proposed PASSs is venous thromboembolism. The secondary 
objectives of these studes will be to compare the long-term safety in adult patients with UC between patients 
treated with ustekinumab and patients treated with other UC disease therapies. The primary outcomes will 
be venous thromboembolism, malignancies and serious infections, as in the existing PASS in Crohn’s 
disease.  
Serious infections including TB and opportunistic infections have occurred following ustekinumab treatment. 
Through Week 8 of the induction phase, a total of 7 subjects had 1 or more serious infection as identified by 
the investigator (0.3% [1 subject], 0.6% [2 subjects], and 1.3% [4 subjects] in the ~6 mg/kg, 130 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively). Among randomised subjects in the maintenance phase, serious AEs of 
infection were reported in 3 (1.7%), 6 (3.5%), and 4 (2.3%) subjects in the ustekinumab q8w, ustekinumab 
q12w, and placebo groups, respectively. No cases of active TB were reported in the induction or 
maintenance studies. A life threatening opportunistic infection of legionella pneumonia was reported for a 
subject in the placebo → ~6 mg/kg group of the induction phase. There were two cases of CMV colitis. Both 
events were of moderate intensity and resulted in hospitalization.  
Overall the rate per 100 subject-years of infections and serious infections are lower for ustekinumab 
compared to placebo treated patients with UC. Again this follows a similar trend observed as for CD and 
psoriatic diseases as evident in the pooled analysis of all diseases. 
There was 1 death reported through the final safety visit of the induction phase; a subject in the ~6 mg/kg 
group experienced sudden death on Study Day 42 attributed to an SAE of oesophageal varices hemorrhage. 
The event was considered not to be related to study agent by the investigator. The subject had no reported 
history of portal hypertension or cirrhosis. Two other deaths occurred in the study, one in the maintenance 
study attributed to acute respiratory failure that occurred during thyroid surgery for a multinodular goiter 
and the other which occurred during the ongoing LTE (after maintenance week 44) and attributed to failure 
to thrive. This latter death was complicated by CMV. The third case is considered possibly related to 
ustekinumab and confirms the need for the precautionary statement about treatment of elderly and patients 
with history of recurrent infections as per section 4.4 of the SPC. 
Serious infections will be evaluated as a primary outcome of the proposed PASSs studies.. 
Seven subjects in the treatment group versus 1 in the placebo group developed malignancies. Most of these 
malignancies were diagnosed within 6 months of the first dose. The standardised incidence ratios (excluding 
in situ cervical cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer) using epidemiological data from the SEER database, 
adjusting for age and race, is presented to place these occurrences into context of what might be expected 
for the population. The SIR obtained is greater than 1 (1.7) for UC and almost three times the SIRs obtained 
for previous indications. The follow-up data to week 220 from the long-term extension study will help to give 
more information on the risk of malignancy in the trial population. In addition the category 3 PASS studies 
will monitor for the risk of malignancies in UC patients. 
Although use of highly effective contraception was an inclusion criteria for ustekinumab patients in the UC 
trials, there were still a number of pregnancies during the trials, however the outcomes seen in the 
ustekinumab pregnancies are comparable with what is expected in the general population. 
The observed safety profile in the induction phase appears less favourable in the elderly (≥65 years) in UC 
compared to placebo treatment. The numbers involved are low and so the ability to draw conclusions in this 
age group is limited. While proportions of those aged 65 years and older reporting AEs, SAEs and infections 
was greater than those <65 years in the induction study, this pattern was not observed in the maintenance 
study. There was however, a significant difference in terms of the numbers of patients who discontinued 
because of an AE in the maintenance study (4% in those <65 years versus 20% in those >65 years) in the 
maintenance phase. The company provided safety summary statistics across the development programme 
for all indications for analysis for sub-populations < 65 yrs and > 65 yrs of age. There were no obvious trends 
Assessment report  
EMA/450688/2019 
Page 148/161 
 
  
  
 
in the data and it did not appear that there is a higher proportion of AEs or SAEs in those aged 65 yrs or 
above. It is noted that a warning exists in section 4.4 of the SmPC stating that “the number of patients aged 
65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they response differently from younger patients. Because 
there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used in 
treating the elderly”.  
Overall, following up to 1 year of ustekinumab treatment, there was no consistent evidence that 
ustekinumab increased cardiovascular risk, there were no cases of anaphylactic or delayed hypersensitivity 
reactions reported to ustekinumab treatment (there was 1 case of anaphylaxis in a placebo treated patient) 
and there was no increase in immunogenicity for ustekinumab patients compared to placebo patients. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall no new safety signals have arisen compared to CD and rates of AEs/SAEs are comparable across 
placebo and ustekinumab treatment groups. However the committee takes due account that no other agents 
with activity against IL-12 or IL-23 are available for ulcerative colitis and therefore there is no experience in 
this population with other similar agents over the long-term. Certain safety concerns could potentially have 
longer latencies, for example malignancy and some infections. Therefore long-term safety in patients with 
ulcerative colitis will be further characterised by means of a long term safety extension of the maintenance 
trial and two prospective observational category 3 PASSs as defined in the RMP..

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore the text “No new safety concerns 
were identified in this study extension with up to 2 years of treatment in patients with Crohn’s Disease” was 
moved from SmPC 4.8 to 5.1 as it relates to a specific study. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require 
user consultation with target patient groups.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for is the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a biologic or have medical contraindications to such therapies. 
UC is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of the colon characterised by alternating episodes of 
remission and spontaneous relapse. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No current pharmacological therapy is able to provide a cure for UC. The goal of UC medical treatment is the 
induction and maintenance of disease remission without the need for long-term corticosteroids. Approved 
systemic therapies for the treatment of UC include anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agents such as 
golimumab, infliximab, and adalimumab, the α4β7 integrin antagonist vedolizumab, and most recently the 
Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib. These agents are currently available for the treatment of patients with UC 
who have had inadequate response or were intolerant to conventional therapy. Vedolizumab and tofacitinib 
are the only products of that group that do not target TNFα and the only products that have demonstrated 
efficacy in patients who have had an inadequate response to (ie, primary non-response or secondary loss of 
response) or are intolerant of anti-TNFs. 
Despite the availability of these approved therapies, not all patients respond to induction therapy (ie, 
primary non-response). In addition, many patients who initially respond to the approved therapies may lose 
response over time (secondary loss of response).  While it appears to be decreasing, the long term 
cumulative colectomy rate after diagnosis is still considerable at 15-20%. An agent effective in both inducing 
and maintaining remission is desirable for clinicians and patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence for the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in the treatment of adult subjects with moderately 
to severely active UC is based on two pivotal Phase 3 studies, an IV induction study and an SC maintenance 
study, which were conducted under a single protocol (UCO3001) but were designed and analysed as two 
separate studies with separate endpoints and Type I error control. The induction study randomized adult 
subjects with moderately to severely active UC who had demonstrated an inadequate response to or failure 
to tolerate conventional or biologic therapy. The maintenance study was a randomized-withdrawal study 
targeting subjects with moderately to severely active UC who had demonstrated a clinical response to 
induction treatment with IV ustekinumab.  
Subjects had moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis based on a Mayo score of 6 to 12, inclusive, 
including an endoscopy subscore ≥2 as assessed during central review of the video of the endoscopy. 
Subjects must also have had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate biologic (TNF antagonists and/or 
the integrin antagonist, vedolizumab) or conventional therapy (corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators [6 
mercaptopurine (6-MP)/azathioprine (AZA)]). To meet the criteria for biologic failure, subjects must have 
received treatment with one or more TNF antagonists or vedolizumab at a dose approved for the treatment 
of UC, and either did not respond initially, responded initially but then lost response, or were intolerant to the 
medication. Subjects who were not biologic failures may have been biologic naïve or may have been exposed 
to biologic therapy but not demonstrated an inadequate response to or intolerance to treatment with a 
biologic agent; these subjects had to have demonstrated an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate

conventional, non-biologic UC therapies. Subjects who had demonstrated corticosteroid dependence were 
also eligible for entry into the study.  
In induction study UCO3001, subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive ustekinumab 130mg IV 
weight-range-based 6mg/kg IV or placebo. Subjects were evaluated at week 8 for the primary endpoint of 
clinical remission as well as clinical response. Enrolment into the SC maintenance study comprised of 
subjects who were randomized to receive IV ustekinumab at Week 0 of the induction study and were in 
clinical response at Week 8 and subjects who were randomized to receive IV placebo at Week 0 of the 
induction study and were not in clinical response at Week 8 but were in clinical response at Week 16 of the 
induction study after receiving an induction dose of IV ustekinumab (~6 mg/kg) at Week 8). 
In maintenance study UCO3001 subjects who were in clinical remission or response were randomised in a 
1:1;1 ratio to ustekinumab 90mg SC q8W, 90mg SC q12w or placebo. Subjects were stratified by clinical 
remission status (25% of maintenance subjects) and not prior biological therapy but the proportions were 
similar in each arm compared to the induction study. The study was conducted for 44 weeks. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the induction study UCO3001 the primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved in 15.6 % 
(p<0.001) and 15.5%(p<0.001) in the 130mg IV and 6mg/kg groups. The placebo rate was 5.3%. The 
major secondary endpoint of endoscopic healing was achieved in 26.3%, 27% and 13.8% in the 130mg, 
6mg/kg and placebo groups respectively(p<0.001). The treatment effects (across primary and major 
secondary) were observed in subjects who were biological failures, non-biological failures and in subjects 
with failure to both anti-TNF and vedolizumab. Clinical remission in biological failures was achieved in 
11.6%, 12.7% and 1.2% in 130mg, 6mg/kg and placebo (p<0.001). Clinical remission in patients who were 
failures to anti-TNF and vedolizumab were achieved in 10.9%, 10.3% and 0% in 130mg, 6mg/kg and 
placebo(p<0.05). With the exception of clinical response where there was a 10% treatment difference in 
favour of the 6mg/kg dose, the efficacy results were similar for both induction doses. 
The primary endpoint in the maintenance study UCO3001 was clinical remission at week 44. The primary 
endpoint was achieved in 38.4%, 43.8% and 24% in the q12w, q8w and placebo groups (p<0.01). The key 
secondary endpoint of steroid free clinical remission was achieved in 37.8%, 42% and 23.4% in the q12w, 
q8w and placebo respectively (P<0.01). The absolute numbers in each group achieving both these endpoints 
were >95% concordant. There were no large treatment effect differences between the two dosing regimens 
for the FAS. The primary and key secondary endpoint was achieved in subjects with biological failure with 
22.9, 39.6 and 17% achieving clinical remission in the q12w, q8w and placebo groups (P<0.5). In patient 
with biological failure, the treatment effect was larger (>10%) in the q8w groups.  
The endpoint of maintenance of remission in remitters at baseline was achieved in 65% (p<0.05), 57.9% 
(P>0.05) and 37.8% in the q12w, q8w and placebo. FAS 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  primary  endpoint  in  the  induction  study  was  defined  by  Mayo  score  of  2  or  less  with  no  subscore 
exceeding 1. The CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Guideline states that the primary endpoint should reflect both 
endoscopic and symptomatic remission and should include cessation of rectal bleeding i.e.  rectal bleeding 
sub-score of 0. It is noted that he applicant also applied the US definition of clinical remission which specified 
rectal score of 0 and this endpoint was also achieved. Furthermore, the ideal primary endpoint of remission 
at  the  end  of  maintenance  should  be  steroid  free  remission.  In  this  application  a  multiplicity  controlled 
secondary  endpoint  meets  that  criteria of  steroid  free  clinical  remission  rather  than  the  primary  but  the 
proportions meeting both endpoints are almost the same.

A plateau effect on the induction dose could not be clearly demonstrated however, as the totality of data 
supports the proposed induction, this is not further pursued. 
There was no direct active comparator which limits conclusions on efficacy in comparison to other existing 
therapies. However, the clinical remission rates for the FAS are similar to historical phase 3 results for other 
non-conventional therapies. There is no efficacy data beyond one year. 
Treatment of subjects with failure to biological therapy represent a key treatment goal relative to unmet 
need and this is part of the claimed indication wording. The maintenance of efficacy is demonstrated for 
subjects  who  have  failed  either  anti-TNF  or  vedolizumab  but  there  were  limited  patients  enrolled  in  the 
pivotal  maintenance  trial  who  failed  both,  anti-TNF  and  vedolizumab  (70  subjects  randomized  into 
maintenance).  
In patients with failure to anti-TNF and vedolizumab the primary endpoint was achieved in 22.7%, 33.3% 
and 14.8% in the q12w, q8w and placebo groups, but did not reach statistical significance. The study was 
not powered to detect a difference in this subgroup and the numbers were fewer than 10 in each group but 
the applicant has demonstrated point estimates of efficacy in different strata (including patients having been 
exposed  to/failing  non-TNFα  biologics  and  patients  failing  both  anti-TNF  and  vedolizumab)  that  indicate 
efficacy is present across strata.  Demonstration of clinically important efficacy of ustekinumab in the most 
refractory treatment group cannot be considered robust but it can be anticipated that ustekinumab will be 
used extensively in this patient population. Therefore existing data on this subgroup and are of particular 
interest to prescribers and were added to 5.1. of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse reactions (> 5%) in controlled periods of the adult psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis 
and Crohn’s disease clinical studies with ustekinumab were nasopharyngitis and headache. Based on the 
postmarketing safety surveillance, hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and urticaria), serious 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), lower respiratory tract infection, allergic 
alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, erythrodermic psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis, were identified as ADRs.  
Serious infections (including mycobacterial and salmonella infections) and malignancies represent important 
potential risks due to the mechanism of action. Current post-marketing registries for patients with moderate 
to severe psoriasis and Crohn’s disease aim to further characterise long term safety for these indications. 
One new ADR of sinusitis has been included in the SmPC of ustekinumab otherwise no new safety signals 
have  arisen  compared  to  CD  and  rates  of  AEs/SAEs  are  comparable  across  placebo  and  ustekinumab 
treatment  groups.  Cases  of  sinusitis  were  mainly  non-serious.  Other  concerns  are  raised  in  relation  to 
opportunistic  infections,  vascular  thrombosis,  and  malignancies  in  patients  with  moderately  to  severely 
active ulcerative colitis treated with ustekinumab (please refer to “uncertainties” below).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety analysis of the current clinical development programme show a safety profile consistent with 
what is already known about Stelara. However, a higher standardised rate (SIR) of malignancies was 
identified in treated UC patients. The SIR obtained when compared to epidemiological data from the SEER 
database was greater than 1 (1.7) for UC and almost three times the SIRs obtained for previous indications. 
The follow-up data to week 220 from the long-term extension study will help to give more information on the 
risk of malignancy in the trial population.  
Two cases of DVTs occurred in the ~6 mg/kg group during the induction phase versus none in the placebo 
group. A bilateral PE occurred in the maintenance study in the ustekinumab q12w group. While the numbers 
are low and it is acknowledged that these cases had risk factors, it is noted that a numerical increase in VTEs 
in ustekinumab treated patients was also seen in the CD studies.

Taking into account that no other agents with activity against IL-12 or IL-23 are available for ulcerative 
colitis there is no experience in this population with other similar agents over the long-term in particular on 
opportunistic infections, vascular thrombosis and malignancies. Therefor the MAH will monitor and 
characterize the long-term safety of ustekinumab in patients with ulcerative colitis further post authorisation 
by means of a long term safety extension of the maintenance trial and two prospective observational PASSs 
as described as category 3 studies in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal studies were appropriately designed and representative of the intended treatment population. 
For the primary endpoint of clinical remission, induction therapy with ustekinumab was superior to placebo, 
even in heavily pre-treated patients. Statistically significant benefit was also demonstrated for the major 
secondary endpoints. 
For the maintenance study the primary endpoint was clinical remission at 44 weeks and this was achieved. 
Steroid free remission was presented and controlled as a secondary endpoint but has been viewed with the 
primary endpoint to further align with the CHMP guidance. This was achieved and therefore a clinically 
meaningful benefit has been demonstrated for ustekinumab in patients with and without prior biological 
failure. It represents a new mechanism of action in the treatment of UC and the infrequent dosing (every 
12 weeks or every 8 weeks if loss of response) may be considered as a patient advantage. For the same 
reason, compliance issues should be considered with regard to the infrequent dosing and the relapsing 
natural history of UC. 
The safety profile appears to be consistent with what is known for ustekinumab. The newly identified adverse 
reaction of sinusitis does not alter the benefit-risk. Further long term safety data on ustekinumab Ulcerative 
Colitis will become available by means of two category 3 PASSs and a long term safety extension of the 
maintenance trial as defined in the RMP.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The demonstrated clinical meaningful benefits of treatment with ustekinumab 130mg, 6mg/kg IV and 90mg 
SC outweigh the risks in patients with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic or have 
medical contraindications to such therapies. Based on the data presented to date, the AE profile in 
moderately to severely active UC appears to be consistent with the expected safety profile for ustekinumab. 
Whilst routine risk minimisation remains sufficient to minimise the risks of the product long term safety in 
adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis has been included in the RMP as an area 
of missing information and will be addressed by the long-term safety extension of the maintenance trial and 
two category 3 PASSs as described in the RMP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Stelara for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a biologic or have medical contraindications to such therapies (See Section 5.1)  is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic or have medical contraindications to such therapies. As a consequence, 
the SmPC, Package Leaflet and RMP have been updated.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Labelling and to the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication for Stelara to include treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic or have medical contraindications to such therapies. As a consequence, 
the SmPC, Package Leaflet and RMP have been updated.

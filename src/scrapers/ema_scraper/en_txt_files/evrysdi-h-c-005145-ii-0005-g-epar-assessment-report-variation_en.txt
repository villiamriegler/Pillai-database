2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Introduction 
2.1.1.   Problem statement 
Given the unmet medical need for alternative treatment options for this very young patient population (as 
described below) and the rapidly progressive nature of the disease in some patients, particularly those with 
two survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) copies, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) considers the need 
for an update in the indication to support the treatment of infants with SMA under 2 months of age. The 
MAH regards this to be a matter of urgency for patients and their families and proposes the extension of 
the indication to those children below 2 months of age. 
Disease or condition 
SMA is a monogenic neuromuscular disorder resulting in severe weakness of the limbs, trunk, bulbar and 
respiratory muscles secondary to the dysfunction of alpha motor neurons. SMA spectrum is highly variable; 
patients  may  experience  failure  to  gain  motor  milestones  and  motor  function,  recurrent  respiratory 
infections, swallowing difficulties, contractures, scoliosis, and reduced life expectancy. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
This variation application provides interim results from Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) in order to support 
the risdiplam dose determination for patients below 2 months of age. 
Epidemiology  
When  not  treated,  SMA  is  the  leading  genetic  cause  of  mortality  in  infants  and  young  children  with  an 
estimated incidence of 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births and carrier frequency of 1 in 40 60 individuals.

EMA/808679/2022

Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder secondary to loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the SMN1 
gene  with  subsequent  loss  of  SMN  protein  expression.  In  humans,  there  are  two  SMN  genes,  the  SMN1 
gene  and  its  paralog  SMN2.  The  SMN2  pre-messenger  ribonucleic  acid  (mRNA)  undergoes  alternative 
splicing  that  excludes  exon  7  from  85%-90%  of  mature  SMN2  transcripts,  which  produces  an  unstable 
SMNdelta7 protein that is rapidly degraded. Therefore, full length SMN2 mRNA is generated in only 10%-
15% of splicing events.  
SMA is characterized by the dysfunction of alpha motor neurons within the anterior horn of the spinal cord, 
leading to skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. 
Clinical presentation 
Clinically, SMA ranges in disease severity. For classification purposes, patients are usually categorized into 
four main subtypes (Types 1-4) based on clinical criteria, including achieving (or failing to achieve) motor 
milestones, age at onset, and life span. As evidenced in a worldwide cohort report, in SMA patients with 
2 SMN2  copies,  the  phenotype  identified  corresponded  to  Type 1  (79%  of  patients),  Type 2  (16%),  and 
Type 3 (5%), while in SMA patients with 3 SMN2 copies, the phenotype identified corresponded to Type 1 
(15% of patients), Type 2 (54%), and Type 3 (31%). In SMA patients with 4 SMN2 copies, the phenotype 
identified corresponds to Type 3 (88%), Type 2 (11%) and Type 1 (1%). Most patients reported as Type 
IV presented four gene copies (21/26; 81%), 2 had five copies (8%), and one individual showed 6 SMN2 
copies (4%). 
Management 
There is evidence to support early administration of therapy with minimal delay after diagnosis is critical to 
prevent  motor  neuron  loss,  ensuring  better  clinical  outcomes  such  as  prevention  of  long-term  disease 
complications. International consensus is to offer immediate treatment for infants diagnosed with SMA via 
newborn screening. 
For  patients  with  SMA  below  2  months  of  age,  there  are  currently  two  approved  therapies:  Spinraza® 
(nusinersen)  and  Zolgensma®  (onasemnogene  abeparvovec).  Spinraza  is  an  SMN2-directed  antisense 
oligonucleotide administered intrathecally, thus largely limiting the effects to the central nervous system 
(CNS) only. The first 3 loading doses of Spinraza are administered at 14-day intervals, followed by a 4th 
loading  dose  after  30 days  and  maintenance  dose  every  4 months  thereafter.  Zolgensma  is  a  one-time 
intravenously  administered  gene-replacement  therapy  that  uses  a  nonreplicating  adeno-associated  virus 
(AAV) capsid to deliver a functional copy of the SMN1 gene. High-dose, systemic corticosteroid treatment 
is required prior to and following Zolgensma administration. 
Despite the availability of these therapies, there remains an unmet medical need for additional treatment 
options  for  patients  below  2 months  of  age,  especially  when  considering  prompt  treatment  initiation. 
Specific factors contributing to the current unmet medical need are described below: 
Required  hospital  setting  for  Zolgensma  and  Spinraza  administration  presents  challenges  for 
patients:  both  Zolgensma  and  Spinraza  therapies  require  an  in-hospital  setting  for  treatment 
administration and short-term monitoring. Exposure to a hospital setting can introduce an infection risk to 
newborn  babies.  In  addition,  situations  where  external  factors  may  prevent  patients  visiting  health  care 
facilities  can  limit  therapy  administration  (for  both  therapies)  and  the  consistent  use  of  Spinraza.  An 
example of an external factor is the COVID-19 pandemic and the global measures applied to ensure social 
isolation and changes in hospital priorities, thereby forcing physicians to postpone elective procedures such 
as  repeat  nusinersen  intrathecal  administration.  These  situations  pose  extra  challenges  for  affected 
patients,  which  could  be  addressed  by  availability  of  risdiplam  as  an  orally  administered  medication  for 
home 
use.  
Other logistical restrictions can arise, such as the distance to specialized centers, which may reduce the 
patients’ ability to access Zolgensma and Spinraza. A survey of patients and caregivers in the United States 
found that 39 of 77 respondents (50%) had to drive more than 1 hour to receive Spinraza at their treatment 
center. This may pose extra challenges when travelling with a fragile newborn baby. 
Zolgensma administration may be delayed in patients with elevated anti-AAV9 antibody titers 
or  infections:  In  Zolgensma  clinical  trials,  patients  were  required  to  have  baseline  anti-AAV9  antibody 
titers of δ1:50. As the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in patients with titers above 1:50 have not been

evaluated, the Zolgensma E.U. Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) describes the need to perform 
baseline  testing  for  the  presence  of  anti-AAV9  antibodies  prior  to  treatment  infusion  and  that  re-testing 
may be performed if titers are >1:50. The presence of anti-AAV9 IgG could limit Zolgensma’ s therapeutic 
benefit, as it can potentially reduce transduction capacity. Data indicate that even low levels of neutralizing 
antibodies  (1:5–1:10)  can  completely  abrogate  transduction  even  with  high  titers  of  vectors.  An  IgG  to 
AAV9 seropositive rate of 47% has been reported in healthy volunteers. IgG antibodies cross the placental 
barrier  and,  in  a  small  proportion,  may  be  detected  in  breastmilk.  Both  processes  are  mechanisms  of 
acquired immunity in newborn infants. Considering the half-life of passively acquired IgG antibodies (35 to 
40 days), in SMA patients < 2 months of age with elevated anti-AAV9 antibody titers, repeating the test 
prior to Zolgensma treatment administration could considerably delay the initiation of treatment due to the 
time period required for the decay of this passive immunity and to re-test antibodies. In Zolgensma clinical 
trials,  screen  failures  due  to  antibody  elevations  ( > 1:50  of  anti-AAV9  IgG)  have  been  reported.  In  the 
SPR1NT trial, in patients aged δ6 weeks, this accounted for 2 of 14 (14.3%) patients who were tested at 
screening. In the event of an infection (e.g., rhinovirus infection common in infants), it is recommended 
that  patients  should  wait  at  least  2 weeks  after  the  illness  resolves  before  initiating  treatment  with 
Zolgensma, because infection before or after infusion could lead to more serious complications (Zolgensma 
SmPC). A delay of at least 2 weeks before treatment can be started is significant for a disease where time 
is critical to prevent motor neuron loss. 
Safety risks are associated with Zolgensma therapy and concomitant corticosteroid treatment: 
the Zolgensma SmPC includes special warnings and precautions for use for acute serious liver injury, acute 
liver failure, and elevated aminotransferases requiring intensive liver function monitoring prior to, and for 
at  least  3  months  after  the  infusion.  In  the  SPR1NT  study,  which  investigated  Zolgensma  use  in 
30 presymptomatic  SMA  patients  aged  δ6 weeks,  adverse  events  (AEs)  related  to  hepatotoxicity  were 
reported for 8 of 30 (26.7%) infants (Novartis Gene Therapies website). In addition, of the 29 patients with 
2  and  3 SMN2 copies,  transaminase  elevations though  not  reported  as  AEs occurred  in  10  of  14  (71%) 
and 
respectively.  
The high-dose, systemic corticosteroid regimen required in association with Zolgensma administration can 
be  of  variable  duration  depending  on  any  observed  clinical  or  laboratory  findings  and  may  also  require 
adjustment to the vaccination schedule. Corticosteroids may increase the risks related to infections with 
any pathogen (Prednisolone SmPC), and this risk may be greater for neonates who have more immature 
immune systems compared to older children and adults and, thus, are more vulnerable to infections. Other 
known risks associated with prolonged systemic corticosteroid treatment are hypertension, gastrointestinal 
effects, and hyperglycemia, and the risk of adrenal insufficiency may be greater in newborns.

Safety risks are associated with intrathecal route of administration of Spinraza: the  intrathecal 
injection route of administration is relevant to the Spinraza safety profile and has been associated with AEs. 
In the NURTURE trial, investigating Spinraza in 25 pre-symptomatic SMA patients aged δ6 weeks, 17 AEs 
in 8 patients were reported to be possibly related or definitely related to the lumbar puncture procedure. 
This included 1 serious event of post-lumbar puncture syndrome. Five hemorrhages near the thecal space 
in 4 participants occurred in the setting of multiple lumbar puncture attempts; all events occurred when 
participants  were  <6 weeks  old.  In  addition,  patients  who  have  low  platelets  or  who  have  an  abnormal 
coagulation  profile  may  be  prevented  from  receiving  Spinraza  due  to  risks  of  hemorrhage  during 
administration and medical contraindication to lumbar puncture procedures. This example illustrates that 
contraindications to lumbar puncture procedures may prevent patients from receiving Spinraza, supporting 
the need for SMA therapies with an alternative route of administration in neonates.  
In conclusion, although there are two therapies (Zolgensma and Spinraza) approved for the treatment of 
infants aged <2 months diagnosed with SMA, there remains an unmet medical need. The option of an oral 
therapy with an easy and sustainable at-home administration schedule and a favorable safety profile should 
be available to physicians and parents as soon as possible, to support an early treatment plan for a life-
long disease. For the reasons described above, and given the crucial and narrow window of opportunity for 
optimal  efficacy  of  any  SMA  treatment  in  neonates  and  young  infants  up  to  2 months  of  age  who  are 
expected to present with a severe phenotype, risdiplam provides a valuable treatment option for infants 
aged <2 months diagnosed with SMA. 
2.1.2.  
About the product 
Risdiplam  (Evrysdi→),  also  known  as  RO7034067,  is  the  first  orally  administered  small  molecule  SMN2 
(survival of motor neuron 2) splicing modifier developed for the treatment of SMA. It directly targets the 
underlying molecular deficiency of the disease, promoting the inclusion of exon 7 to generate full length 
SMN2 mRNA and thereby increasing the production of functional SMN protein.

Risdiplam  was  approved  in  August  2020  in  the  United  States  and  March  2021  in  the  European  Union, 
followed  by  additional  marketing  authorizations  in  over  90 international  markets  as  of  the  date  of  this 
report. 
This variation application provides interim results from Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) in order to support 
the risdiplam dose determination for patients below 2 months of age. Due to the challenges of recruiting 
such young infants with a rare disease, Study BN40703 was still open for enrollment at the time of the start 
of this procedure.

programme/compliance  with 
CHMP 
This submission is based on data from an interim analysis, with 18 patients included in the efficacy and 
safety  data  set  (clinical  cutoff  date  [CCOD]  1  July  2021).  A  later  cut-off  for  PK  data  (31  August  2021) 
enabled inclusion of further PK data (including 1 additional new patient), in order to maximize the PK data 
available for dose selection. Although the primary objectives of Study BN40703 are safety and efficacy, tt 
must be highlighted that PK and PK-PD are the main objectives in this application. 
As discussed upon Marketing Authorization (please refer to risdiplam EPAR) “it may be acknowledged that 
the overall findings of the risdiplam studies and the literature support the early initiation of treatment with 
risdiplam.  The  benefit/risk  balance  is  therefore  considered  favorable  also  in  patients  with  up  to  4  SMN2 
copies that have received a genetic diagnosis, considering the unmet need and extrapolating the observed 
beneficial effects from the symptomatic patients. The uncertainties of such extrapolation of the data from 
symptomatic  patients  to  pre-  or  pauci-symptomatic  patients  that  have  not  yet  reached  the  criteria  for 
clinical diagnosis are also expected to be clarified by the data, generated in the agreed post-authorization 
measures”.  
As detailed in Annex II, the MAH shall complete by 2030 the following Post-authorisation Efficacy Study 
(PAES):  a  long-term  prospective,  observational  study  to  further  evaluate  disease  progression  in  SMA 
patients  (both  pre-symptomatic  and  symptomatic)  with  1  to  4  SMN2  copies  treated  with  risdiplam,  in 
comparison to natural history data in untreated patients. 
As discussed by PDCO Rapporteur at the time of the EMA/PDCO Modification report, the minimum required 
number of patients submitted in this interim analysis is no longer based, at this step, on primary endpoint 
and  statistical  power  but  on  a  sufficient  number  of  patients  (not  especially  meeting  the  criteria  for  the 
primary efficacy population) required for an appropriate PK dose finding. 
2.1.4.  
General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical trial BN40703 is being conducted in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.   Quality aspects 
Risdiplam is a co-packaged drug-device combination product. It includes the drug product powder for oral 
solution and a delivery kit, which contains a press-in bottle adapter and oral/enteral ENFit syringes of 6 mL 
and 12 mL.  
This application proposes to ensure accurate dosing for patients under 2 months of age, which will need a 
lower volume of reconstituted solution, by using a 1 mL oral/enteral ENFit syringe. The proposed additional 
1 mL oral/enteral ENFit syringe will be part of the new co-packaged delivery kit (Table 1).

The 1 mL syringe is from the same manufacturer and made of the same material as the currently registered 
and supplied 6 mL and 12 mL oral/enteral ENFit syringes, and covered by the same 510(k) and CE mark. 
All syringes provided in the new co-packaged delivery kit are reusable. 
One  of  the  12  mL  oral/enteral  ENFit  syringes  will  be  removed  from  the  new  co-packaged  delivery  kit. 
Indeed, a spare unit of the different syringe sizes is currently included in the new co-packaged delivery kit 
for  the  user’s  convenience,  to  mitigate  potential  risk  of  ink  fading  with  the  multi-use  of  the  syringes. 
However, considering the high volume withdrawn with a 12 mL syringe, fewer use cycles are required until 
all drug product solution is withdrawn from the bottle and therefore there is no risk of ink fading for this 
syringe size, and the spare unit will be withdrawn. 
The use of the 1 mL oral/enteral ENFit syringe is supported by the information included in the updated CTD 
sections of Module 3, as well as Module 1. It has been assessed by the MAH for quality, safety, and efficacy. 
The assessment studies included the following parameters:  
USABILITY 
The usability risk assessment for the intended quality of 1 mL oral/enteral syringe was based on intended 
use, instruction for constitution, and user interface. 
Intended use: the reconstituted solution is to be orally or enterally administered with the current 6 or 12 
mL oral/enteral syringes or with the proposed 1 mL oral/enteral syringe. There is no change in the intended 
use with the new syringe size. 
Instructions for constitution: almost similar instructions for constitution are provided with the addition of a 
new  size  of  syringe.  The  new  syringe  enables  users  to  perform  the  same  tasks  to  administer  a  dose  of 
reconstituted solution. Only minor updates have been introduced in the Instructions for constitution: Full 
information is provided in this application. 
User interface: The design features of the new 1 mL oral/enteral syringe are comparable with the currently 
registered and used 6 mL and 12 mL oral/enteral syringes. The potential impact of the change in graduation 
units is related to dosing rather than patient use. 
COMPATIBILITY ASSESSMENT 
Compatibility studies have been carried out with the proposed 1 mL syringes during product development, 
supporting compatibility with the drug and with the feeding tubes using ENTFit connectors. 
DOSING ACCURACY 
The proposed 1 mL syringe will have graduation units of 0.01 mL, whereas the current 6 and 12 mL syringes 
have graduation units of 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL, respectively. Due to this change, updates have been made to 
the Instructions for Constitution and Instructions for Use. Dosing accuracy testing was conducted according 
to ISO 7886-3 using risdiplam oral solution clinical formulation at 0.25 mg/mL and for higher dose with the 
commercial formulation at 0.75 mg/mL. For each solution strength, a minimum dose volume was withdrawn 
with the smaller oral syringe size (1 mL) and the maximum volume with the larger oral syringe size (6 mL 
and 12 mL). Due to the low and comparable viscosities of the two risdiplam oral solution strengths, the 
dosing accuracy of the 1mL oral syringes is also confirmed for the 0.75 mg/mL risdiplam oral solution based 
on the testing results from the 0.25 mg/mL risdiplam oral solution. 
The  formulation  proposed  is  unchanged  compared  to  the  already  authorized  formulation  intended  for  a 
patient population of 2 months or older. The procedure of first authorization was accompanied by a post 
authorization measure since the data on the adequacy of the proposed amount of sodium benzoate (0.375 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/808679/2022

mg/mL) in the formulation were uncertain. The MAH was requested to perform a new preservative efficacy 
test  (PET)  study  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  5.1.3  in  order  to  re-evaluate  the  antimicrobial  efficacy  of  sodium 
benzoate in the range of 0 to 0.30 mg/mL and provide results by the end of Q2 2021.  
Subsequently,  the  MAH  presented  a  PET  study,  according  to  the  Ph.  Eur.  5.1.3  requirements,  including 
formulations with three different concentrations of sodium benzoate (0.0 mg/mL, 0.15 mg/mL and 0.30 
mg/mL). Results obtained with the preservative-free formulation (0.0 mg/mL,) did not comply with the Ph. 
Eur.  specifications,  particularly  for  Aspergillus  brasiliensis.  Therefore,  this  formulation  did  not  provide  a 
preservative  effect  and  confirmed  the  need  for  preservative  inclusion  in  the  formulation.  The  sodium 
benzoate concentrations of 0.15 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL resulted to be the most efficacious concentrations 
since they met all Ph. 5.1.3. requirements, thus providing preservative effect. In the light of these results, 
the  MAH  proposed  to  modify  the  commercial  formulation  containing  the  lowest  feasible  level  of  sodium 
benzoate,  using  as  a  starting  point  a  0.15  mg/mL  sodium  benzoate  concentration.  This  proposal  was 
considered acceptable, yet still to be evaluated.  
However, in the proposed line extension the formulation maintains the same amount of sodium benzoate 
and no discussion in this regard was present. According to the guideline EMEA/CHMP/QWP/396951/2006 
‘Guideline on excipients in the dossier for application for marketing authorization of a medicinal product’ 
the concentration of antimicrobial preservatives used should be at the lowest feasible level. This aspect is 
especially relevant since in the extension of indication the target patient population concerns infants below 
2 months of age. 
Sodium benzoate is of particular concern in pre-term and full-term neonates where immaturity of metabolic 
enzymes  until  8  weeks  of  age  may  result  in  an  accumulation  of  benzoic  acid.  Neonatal  unconjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia and resultant clinical jaundice affect up to 85% of newborns, usually this condition is 
benign. However, the displacement of bilirubin from albumin leads to hyperbilirubinaemia which may cause 
a serious concern of brain injury in some neonates with jaundice (please refer to EMA/CHMP/508189/2013). 
In  this  context,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  a  lower  concentration  could  have  been  feasible  based  on  the 
results  of  the  conducted  PET  study.  However,  studies  conducted  to  decrease  the  sodium  benzoate 
concentration to the lowest feasible level showed a significant test-to-test variability, although the results 
from testing Lab 1 appear not variable, while those from Lab 2 are highly variable. PET results for EMA from 
Lab 2 show similar behaviour to findings from Lab 1. Therefore, variability may be related to Lab 2 and not 
to the method.  
The MAH declared that no significant decrease of the sodium benzoate content until end of shelf life was 
found  for  Evrysdi,  but  preservative  efficacy  decreased  over  shelf  life,  which  may,  in  fact,  be  due  test 
variability.  According  to  the  MAH  results  also  conducted  to  a  minimal  efficacious  concentration  of  0.25 
mg/mL,  leading  to  a  nominal  sodium  benzoate  concentration  of  0.33  mg/mL  in  the  new  formulation. 
Therefore, the MAH proposed to maintain the current market formulation containing 0.375 mg/mL sodium 
benzoate, however, at this stage doubts remain on the selected amount of preservative. 
Additional data from PET test conducted in different laboratories could clarify the reason of the variability 
of the results among different labs and justify the calculation of minimum amount of sodium benzoate. 
It  should  be  noticed  that  sodium  benzoate  is  used  in  concentrations  of  0.02–0.5%  in  oral  medicines 
(Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 9th Edition, 2020). A toxicological assessment of the excipients, 
including sodium benzoate, in the oral drug formulation (report 1077240) for paediatric use was submitted 
in the first marketing authorisation application. The calculated maximum dose per kg body weight and per 
day  was  calculated  (1.95  mg  for  a  6  kg  baby),  which  took  into  consideration  the  low  dose  strength  of 
Ro703-4067/F12  (0.25  mg/mL  RO7034067)  as  a  worst-case  scenario.  The  total  daily  dose  is  below  the 
threshold for toxic effects (the accepted daily intake is 5 mg/kg/day) and considered not to pose a particular 
risk relevant for any paediatric age group.  
Sodium benzoate is reported to be not mutagenic and shows no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice and 
rats.  Benzoic  acid  yields  no  adverse  effects  at  750  mg/kg/day  via  dietary  administration.  Moreover,  in 
developmental and reproductive studies, sodium benzoate had no adverse effects in mice and rabbits up 
to doses of 175 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. In rats, sodium benzoate showed adverse 
effects  on  foetuses  and  delivered  offspring  only  at  very  high  dietary  doses  with  a  no-observed-adverse-
effect  level  established  at  1310  mg/kg/day.  However,  no  clear  reference  was  provided  by  the  MAH  with 
regards to sodium benzoate non-clinical toxicity data.  
From the totality of available data and previous discussions, it’s agreed that the inclusion of an antimicrobial 
preservative cannot be avoided, but the MAH should continue to develop efforts to demonstrate that the 
current concentration is the lowest effective level. The weight of evidence approach should be provided in

the follow up Scientific Advice in order to complete the knowledge on the critical issues of this preservative. 
According  to  EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012  Rev.  2,  the  use  of  preservatives  is  normally  considered 
acceptable in multidose preparations, and the need to preserve a paediatric preparation and the choice of 
the  preservative  system  at  the  lowest  concentration  feasible  should  be  justified  in  terms  of  benefit-risk 
balance.  Justification  in  terms  of  safety  and  efficacy  has  been  given,  based  on  the  positive  benefit/risk 
profile of risdiplam after approval.  
Additionally,  the  inclusion  of  information  in  the  PI  is  currently  considered  adequate  and  sufficient  until 
further reduction of sodium benzoate concentration is achieved: “Sodium benzoate may increase jaundice 
(yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old)).” 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  selected  sodium  benzoate  levels  should  be  discussed  as  part  of  a  separate 
Scientific Advice procedure. The PAM previously agreed continues to apply to the authorisation.  
2.3.   Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application (besides environmental risk assessment (ERA)), 
which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA provided by the MAH is based on the guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  June  2006)  and  the  Questions  and  Answers  on 
‘Guideline  on 
for  human  use’ 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1, 2016). 
risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
the  environmental 
Based on the low values of PECsurfacewater and log Dow values at 3 environmental relevant pHs, below the 
action limits established by the guideline, the MAH concludes that no Phase II assessment is required. 
The Log Dow values at pH 5, 7 and 9 were below the trigger value of 4.5, risdiplam is not considered to be 
a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Then, no formal PBT assessment is required. 
PECsurfacewater  was  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  refined  fraction  of  a  population  receiving  the  active 
substance during a given time which was based on the prevalence of SMA, all types. Although no value was 
presented in the ERA report,, it was provided upon request.  
The  precautionary  and  safety  measures  taken  to  reduce  any  risk  to  the  environment  by  including  the 
general statement on the SmPC and packet leaflet (PL) have been applied. 
2.3.2.   Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
All issues regarding the ERA were satisfactorily clarified during this procedure, and the updated ERA report 
is considered acceptable. From the results of ERA studies, no significant environmental safety issues were 
identified. 
2.3.3.  
Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure further to the use of risdiplam.  
2.4.   Clinical aspects

Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical method 
The liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytical method SOP_M_1174 used 
to determine risdiplam and its main metabolite M1 plasma concentration is the same used within the initial 
marketing authorisation application. Bioanalytical report of RAINBOWFISH study has been submitted and 
represents the only new data. 
Special populations 
Pediatric population below 2 months 
Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling was performed to assess risdiplam PK of the SMA patients 
enrolled  in  Study  BN40703  (RAINBOWFISH),  aged  from  birth  to  6  weeks  (at  first  dose)  who  have  been 
genetically diagnosed with SMA but are not yet presenting with symptoms. All available risdiplam plasma 
concentrations available by 31 August 2021 from samples collected in Study BN40703 were combined with 
the PK data included in the previously developed popPK modelling from clinical Studies BP29840, BP39054, 
BP39055, BP39056 and BP41361. Additional data collected from patients with Type 1 SMA participating in 
Study  BP39056  up  to  the  Month  24  visit  (clinical  cut-off  date  [CCOD:  12  November  2020)  were  also 
included. The developed model was used to describe risdiplam plasma concentration data of the patients 
with SMA of Study BN40703. 
Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) 
Study BN40703 is an ongoing, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical study to investigate the efficacy, 
safety,  PK,  and  PD  of  risdiplam  in  patients  aged  from  birth  to  6  weeks  (at  first  dose)  who  have  been 
genetically diagnosed with SMA (SMN1 deletion and any SMN2 copies) but are not yet presenting with SMA 
symptoms. 
Per protocol, the first patient between 4 and 6 weeks (29 to 42 days) of age at first dosing had to receive 
a once daily oral dose of 0.04 mg/kg of risdiplam to assess safety, tolerability, and PK at this starting dose. 
According to the protocol, the first patient enrolled aged between 7 days and 28 days at the time of first 
dose was to receive a once daily oral dose of 0.004 mg/kg. However, the dose could be adjusted based on 
emerging  data  from  this  and  other  studies  with  risdiplam,  and  emerging  PK  data  from  the  first  patients 
enrolled in this study indicated that the dose of 0.004 mg/kg would not be required. 
In the last approved PIP, for the RAINBOWFISH study, it is reported that “The dose will be selected based 
on data from BP39056 in infants (Part 1). The dose may be modified to ensure that the target exposure is 
achieved  and  the  exposure  cap  of  2000  ng.h/mL  is  not  exceeded”,  also  in  the  BD  provided  for  the  pre-

submission of the present application is reported “Study BN40703 / RAINBOWFISH is an open-label, single-
arm, multicenter clinical study in presymptomatic SMA patients aged from birth to 6 weeks (at first dose). 
All patients are receiving risdiplam orally once daily at a dose selected to achieve the targeted exposure of 
close  to  a  mean  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  2000  ng.h/mL.”  However,  in  the 
RAINBOWFISH study, paediatric patients achieved a plasma exposure higher than 2000 ng • h/mL.  
An interim clinical study report (CSR) was submitted, presenting results from an interim analysis to support 
the registration of risdiplam in presymptomatic patients below the age of 2 months. 
In  Study  BN40703,  plasma  PK  samples  were  collected  from  neonates  and  infants  <6 weeks  old  (at first 
dose) who have been genetically diagnosed with SMA but are not yet presenting with symptoms at: 2, 4, 
6 and 24 h post-dose on Day 1, pre-dose, 2, 4, 6 h post-dose on Weeks 4, 8, 28, 52, 78 and 104, while 
pre-dose samples were drawn on Weeks 2, 16, 40, 64 and 92. All PK data available as of 31 August 2021 
were included in the analyses. 
PopPK Modelling 
A popPK analysis of risdiplam was previously performed for 10,222 observations collected from 525 subjects 
(61 healthy subjects and 464 patients with SMA) participating in either of the five clinical Studies BP29840 
(healthy subjects), BP39054 (JEWELFISH), BP39055 (SUNFISH), BP39056 (FIREFISH) or BP41361 (healthy 
subjects) (1102699). 
The risdiplam PK was adequately described by a structural model comprising a three transit compartment 
absorption  model  connected  to  a  systemic  linear  two-compartmental  PK  model.  The  time-varying  body 
weight  and  age  were  included  with  allometric  (body  weight)  and  maturation  (age)  functions  in  the  CL/F 
(apparent clearance) and Vc/F (apparent central volume of distribution) of the structural model to describe 
the variability of the heterogeneous population (age and body weight ranges: 2.2 months to 52.1 years 
and 4.14 to 95.3 kg, respectively). A factor for CL/F of healthy adults was also included as a covariate to 
account for slightly higher CL/F than patients with SMA.  
This model was used as the reference popPK model in the current PK analysis for risdiplam in neonates and 
infants  aged  <6  weeks  (at  first  dose)  who  have  been  genetically  diagnosed  with  SMA  but  are  not  yet 
presenting with symptoms at enrollment in Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH). 
The present popPK modelling initiated with evaluation of the reference PopPK model (1102699) against the 
plasma risdiplam concentration data collected from the SMA patients of Study BN40703 until 31 of August 
2021  as  well  as  the  patients  with  Type  1  SMA  from  Study  BP39056  until  the  Month  24  visit  (CCOD:  12 
November 2020) which were combined with the data set used for the reference model development. The 
reference  model  was  fitted  to  the  combined  data  set  without  estimation  step  and  goodness-of-fit  (GOF) 
plots  were  examined.  When  this  was  considered  not  satisfactory,  then  parameter  estimation  step  and 
further model modifications were conducted. 
Covariate  analyses  were  performed  for  the  reference  model  development  (1102699).  In  addition  to  the 
time-varying age and body weight effect included in the structural model, a factor for CL/F of healthy adults 
was identified as statistically and clinically relevant covariate for the reference popPK model. Due to the 
limited sample size of Study BN40703 (371 observations from 19 SMA patients), corresponding to 3.4% of 
the total risdiplam data, an exploratory analysis on the relationship between post hoc PK parameters and 
covariates was performed instead of formal covariate analyses. 
The  demographics,  risdiplam  dosing  history  and  plasma  concentrations  of  risdiplam  collected  from  544 
subjects,  consisting  of  61  healthy  subjects  (Studies  BP29840  and  BP41361)  and  483  patients  with  SMA 
(Studies BP39054, BP39055, BP39056 and BN40703) were available in the data base as of 31 August 2021 
and  included  in  the  popPK  analysis.  The  demographics  of  the  patients  at  the  time  of  the  first  dose  are 
summarized in Table 3.

excluding the following samples, the remaining 10,939 observations including 345 capillary blood samples

After the reference model (1102699) was fitted to the combined dataset to examine whether the model 
adequately predict risdiplam PK, focusing on the patients with SMA of Study BN40703, it was decided to 
modify the reference popPK model of risdiplam to adequately predict risdiplam PK in patients with SMA of 
Study BN40703 as well as the other populations, with focus on the covariate effects on CL/F and Vc/F.  
The plasma risdiplam concentration data collected from the patients with SMA of Study BN40703 as well as 
the patients with Type 1 SMA from Study BP39056 until the Month 24 visit (CCOD: 12 November 2020) 
were  combined  with  the  data  set  used  for  the  reference  model  development  (1102699).  The  reference 
model (1102699) was fitted to the combined data set to examine whether the model adequately predict 
risdiplam PK, focusing on the patients with SMA of Study BN40703. 
The  application  of  the  reference  popPK  model  to  the  combined  risdiplam  PK  data  set  without  parameter 
estimation step resulted in biased estimates for the SMA patients of Study BN40703 with tendency to over-
predict risdiplam plasma concentrations, particularly for the samples collected while the patients were <6 
weeks old.  
Subsequently, parameter estimation step was conducted based on the reference popPK model structures 
with adaptation of the reference body weight in the allometric scaling to the new population (from 33 kg to 
31.3 kg) and this was successfully converged. The parameters were generally well estimated with relative 
standard error (RSE) of <20% except for the maturation function of Vc/F (Age50-Vc/F) which had RSE of 
79.3%. Inspection of the GOF plots for all populations shown in Figure 3 did not reveal major unexpected 
deficiencies.  The  plots  of  observed  risdiplam  plasma  concentrations  (DV)  versus  population  predicted 
plasma  concentrations  (PRED)  and  the  plots  of  observed  risdiplam  plasma  concentrations  (DV)  versus 
individual predicted plasma concentrations (IPRED) mostly displayed a homogeneous distribution of data 
points around the identity line. However, a subset of the GOFs for the patients with SMA of Study BN40703 
shown in Figure 4 indicated tendency of the model to over-predict risdiplam plasma concentrations in the 
neonates. Distribution of the ETA, inter-individual variability (IIV) of CL/F and Vc/F against age indicated 
under-prediction of CL/F and Vc/F of these patients (<0.1y). Consistently, the prediction-corrected visual 
predictive check (pc-VPC) demonstrated bias in predictions of risdiplam concentrations of the patients with 
SMA of Study BN40703 in the first few months of the treatment whereas the predictions and observations 
were  in  a  good  agreement  thereafter  where  age  and  body  weight  overlap  with  the  other  population  <2 
months old.  
The parameter estimates, GOFs, and pc-VPCs suggested that the reference popPK model is not suited to 
predict  risdiplam  PK  of  the  patients  with  SMA  of  Study  BN40703  even  after  adaptation  of  parameter 
estimates and therefore, the model modification was considered necessary. The distribution of individual 
deviations (ETA) against age indicated necessity to adapt covariate effect on CL/F and Vc/F to improve the 
description of the concentration-time data in the neonates. The steps taken for the model adaptation are 
summarized in Table 5. 
The  reference  popPK  model  included  a  maturation  function  of CL/F  using  maximum  effect  (Emax)  model. 
The following additional parameters were included in the maturation function and tested: 1) E0 (fraction of 
risdiplam clearance at birth [Fracbirth]) which is a fraction of CL/F at birth, 2) a decay describing with fraction 
of CL/F at birth (Fracbirth) followed by decrease (kdecay) with age and 3) fold-factor of CL/F in neonates. The 
estimated allometric coefficient for Vc/F using the reference model structure was 0.982, so it was fixed to 
1.0 and resulting change in objective function (OFV) was inconsequential. 
Among the maturation functions, the E0+Emax model for CL/F and fixed allometric coefficient for Vc/F of 1.0 
(Model  10)  achieved  successful  parameter  estimation  with  improvement  in  ETA-CL/F  distribution.  The 
maturation function with the E0+Emax model predicts higher risdiplam CL/F in the age range <0.2 years old 
than  that  with  the  Emax  model  of  the  reference  model  which  predicts  CL/F=0  L/h  at  birth  (Figure  3). 
Furthermore, removal of the maturation function on Vc/F, which was poorly estimated (RSE=79.3%, and 
indicated little effect (Age50 of 0.019 years) in the reference popPK model, resulted in improvement in ETA-
Vc/F distribution in neonates (<0.1 year, Model 11). 
Although the OFV was increased by +12 from Models 10 to 11, improvement in ETA-Vc/F distribution in 
neonates and numerical stability (condition number: >10,000 versus 88.7, the highest correlation among 
the  parameter  estimates:  0.97  versus  <0.8,  for  Models  10  and  11,  respectively)  were  considered  to 
sufficiently justify the selection of Model 11.

Final Model 
The  parameter  estimates  of  Model  11  summarized  in  Table  6  show  that  they  were  estimated  with  good 
precision  indicated  by  RSE<25%.  The  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  comparable  between  the 
estimates  by  the  covariance  matrix  and  the  bootstrap  analysis,  and  the  intervals  of  each  parameter 
estimates were considered reasonable.

a bootstrap analyses with 200 replicates (77% were successful). 
Degree  of  η-shrinkage  were  5.32,  23.0  and  9.32%  for  CL/F,  transfer  constant  rate  (ktr)  and  Vc/F, 
respectively, indicating that the analyses with post hoc parameters and estimation of individual secondary 
PK  parameters  such  as  AUC  and  (average  concentration  over  observation  period)  Cav  could  be  reliably 
performed. The shrinkage for residual errors were 5.37 and 2.83% for venous and capillary blood samples, 
respectively.  The  condition  number  was  low  (88.7)  and  none  of  the  parameters  estimated  showed  high 
correlations (>0.8) with the others. 
The  GOFs  in  Figure  4  show  good  consistency  between  DV  and  PRED,  as  well  as  IPRED  which  mostly 
displayed a homogenous distribution of data points around the identity line. The distribution of conditional 
weighted residuals were randomly scattered around the zero line with the majority of data between -2.5 
and +2.5 standard deviations against time or population predictions. The IIV (ETA) of CL/F, ktr and Vc/F 
were generally normally distributed. 
The SMA patients of Study BN40703 were 16-41 days old at the first risdiplam dose and 48 days-2 years 
old  at  the  last  dosing  occasion  included  in  this  data  cut.  The  GOFs  of  these  patients  when  they  were 
neonates <6 weeks old (Figure 4) and during the entire observation period (Figure 5) show the ability of 
the model to predict risdiplam PK along with growth of these neonates.

These pc-VPC demonstrated ability of the model to adequately predict central tendency and inter-individual 
variability for all populations as well as the SMA patients of Study BN40703, and therefore, the predictive 
performance of the model was considered satisfactory. 
The  role  of  allometric  and  maturation  functions  in  description  of  risdiplam  CL/F  of  the  final  model  is 
illustrated in Figure 10. 
Figure 10: The Role of Time-Varying Age (Maturation Function) and Body Weight (Allometric Function) as 
Covariate on Description of Risdiplam CL/F  
BW = body weight; CL/F = apparent clearance 
Allometric  function  alone  would  lead  to  significant  bias  in  CL/F  in  young  children,  particularly  with  body 
weight <10 kg. While the allometric exponent (0.259) describes shallow relationship between body weight 
and CL/F, the maturation function alone would lead to biased estimates in the risdiplam CL/F across the 
population. Therefore, both allometric and maturation functions are retained in the final popPK model to 
capture  risdiplam  CL/F  across  the  age  and  body  weight  range.  The  final  model  successfully  achieved  to 
describe risdiplam PK in the population ≥16 days old while maintaining continuum to the populations ≥2 
months old which have been analyzed in the reference popPK modelling.

Based  on  the  numerical  stability,  GOFs  and  pc-VPC,  Model  11  was  selected  as  the  final  popPK  model  of 
risdiplam for the combined data set including the SMA patients of Study BN40703. 
Covariates 
The Empirical Bayes Estimates of ETAs of CL/F, ktr and Vc/F of the patients with SMA of Study BN40703 
were  graphically  analyzed  on  relationship  with  continuous  and  categorical  variables.  The  distribution  of 
ETAs  of  CL/F,  ktr and  Vc/F  against  liver  function  markers  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin were generally homogenous and scattering around ETA=0. There was 
no obvious difference in these ETAs by sex or race. None of the variables examined in the graphical analyses 
indicated potential covariate effects on CL/F, ktr or Vc/F of risdiplam in these 19 patients with SMA of Study 
BN40703. 
PK Parameters 
Individual secondary PK parameters AUC0-24h and average concentration from the first dose to the specified 
time points (Cav) were derived using the post hoc PK parameters of the final popPK model, patients’ actual 
demographics and risdiplam dosing records. There were 13 patients who initiated risdiplam treatment at 
0.2 mg/kg. Two and 4 patients initially received 0.08 or 0.04 mg/kg, respectively, and their dose was then 
increased to 0.2 mg/kg. 
The individual AUC0-24h vs time course of the patients with SMA of Study BN40703 between Days 14 and 
the last risdiplam dosing recorded until 31 August 2021 are shown in Figure 11.

The AUC0-24h time course of all patients with SMA of Study BN40703 (left) and patients starting with 0.2 mg/kg (right) are shown. 
The range and distribution of AUC0-24h were comparable to that observed in the patients with Type 1 SMA 
(Figure 12), although the patients with SMA of Study BN40703 were approximately 140 days younger than 
the patients of Type 1 SMA of Study BP39056 at the first risdiplam dose (median: 28 days [0.074 years] 
versus 172 days [0.47 years] old).

The median risdiplam AUC0-24h of the 13 patients initiated with 0.2 mg/kg on Days 14 and 28 was 2380 and 
2440 ng.h/mL respectively and decreased to 1930 ng.h/mL on Day 56. Similar values are reported when 
the dose normalized risdiplam AUC0-24h values for the 6 patients who started with 0.04 or 0.08 mg/kg were 
included.

a Individual AUC0-24h estimates on Day 14 or later were included. Multiple estimates per patient were included when they were available in the specified age

The median risdiplam AUC0-24h for infants age 1 to 2 months and age 2 to 3 months were 2440 and 2110 
ng.h/mL, respectively in the patients initiated with 0.2 mg/kg, and they were 2440 and 2120, respectively,

In  response  to  the  major  objection  raised  during  the  assessment  of  the  procedure  regarding  the  most 
appropriate  dose  regimen  for  infants  <2  months  old,  the  MAH  has  updated  the  PK  analysis  with  data 
available as of April 2022 from all 26 patients enrolled into Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH), using the final 
reference popPK model. 
The objective of this analysis was to describe risdiplam PK in 26 patients aged < 6 weeks old at first dose 
who have been genetically diagnosed with SMA but are not yet presenting with symptoms at enrollment of 
Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH). The previously developed popPK model using a dataset with 19 patients 
from Study BN40703 served as the reference popPK model in the present analysis, which has included the 
following:  
1)  Evaluate the previously developed popPK model against the updated data including risdiplam plasma 
samples collected from all 26 enrolled patients in the study.  
2)  Derive secondary PK parameters (AUC0-24h and Cav) of all 26 patients to evaluate risdiplam exposure.  
3)  Conduct simulations to explore different risdiplam doses in patients < 2 months old. 
The previously performed popPK model included a total of 10,939 plasma risdiplam concentrations collected 
from  544  subjects  (61  healthy  subjects  and  483  SMA  patients)  participating  in  either  of  the  six  clinical 
studies BP29840, BP39054, BP39055, BP39056, BN40703 or BP41361. Data from study BN40703 as of 31st 
August 2021 included a total of 371 samples from 19 SMA patients available. In the updated popPK analysis, 
7 additional patients and 182 observations available from Study BN40703 were included in the model, and 
therefore a total of 553 observations from 26 patients from Study BN40703 were included in the present 
analysis dataset. Table 10 summarizes the number of observations and number of patients used from each 
study in the revised dataset.

parameter estimation step are shown in Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15 below with indication of these

within the corresponding prediction interval of the pc-VPC (Figure 19). Therefore, the ability of the model 
to predict the central tendency and variability of risdiplam plasma concentrations of the SMA patients of 
Study BN40703 was considered satisfactory.

appreciable improvement was noted in the model with updated parameter estimates, the reference popPK 
model was selected as a suitable popPK model for the analysis of the updated data including 26 patients 
from Study BN40703. A summary of risdiplam AUC0-24h and Cav on Days 14, 28 and 56 after treatment start 
is shown in Table 11, and AUC0-24h summarized by age (infants 1 to 2 months old, and infants 2 to 3 months

The median risdiplam AUC0-24h of the 20 patients initiated with 0.2 mg/kg on Days 14 and 28 was 2790 and

the dose normalized risdiplam AUC0-24h values for the 6 patients who started with 0.04 or 0.08 mg/kg were 
included. The median risdiplam AUC0-24h for infants aged 1 to 2 months and age 2 to 3 months were 2860 
and 2640 ng.h/mL, respectively, in the patients initiated with 0.2 mg/kg; and were 2860 and 2660 ng.h/mL, 
respectively, when the dose normalized risdiplam AUC0-24h values of the 6 patients who started with 0.04 
or 0.08 mg/kg were included. In the previous analysis with 19 patients with SMA from Study BN40703, the 
median risdiplam AUC0-24h of the 13 patients initiated with 0.2 mg/kg were 2380, 2440 and 1930 ng.h/mL 
on Days 14, 28 and 56 respectively. The median risdiplam AUC0-24h for infants age 1 to 2 months and age 
2 to 3 months were 2440 and 2110 ng.h/mL, respectively. The updated analysis with 26 patients with SMA 
in Study BN40703 demonstrated approximately 10 20% higher risdiplam AUC0-24h. The individual AUC0-24h 
results derived from the popPK model are presented in Table 13 (new patients shown in red boxes).

Simulations with different risdiplam dosing regimens for infants < 2 months old were performed to explore 
risdiplam exposures in this population. Actual patients demographics and post hoc PK parameters estimated 
by the popPK model were used. The simulated plasma concentration-time profiles of risdiplam in patients 
<2 months old after 0.15 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg are compared to the simulations in patients 2 months to 2 
years old after 0.2 mg/kg (Figure 20).

BN40703 summarized by age.  
Mean, Median [5-95th] of age is shown. A One patient was < 2 months old at the latest visit and not included in the summary for 2 3 
months old. b Individual AUC0-24h estimates on Day 14 or later were included. Multiple estimates per patient were included when they 
were available in the specified age range. c0.15 mg/kg was given until age of 2 months old and 0.2 mg/kg was given thereafter.  
The  simulations  with  0.2  mg/kg  or  0.15  mg/kg  in  patients  <2  months  old  indicated  that  the  median 
simulated AUC0-24h on Days 14 and 28 were 2840 and 2910 ng.h/mL after 0.2 mg/kg, and 2130 and 2190 
ng.h/mL after 0.15 mg/kg, respectively. The median simulated AUC0-24h of 1 to 2 months old and 2 to 3 
months old were 2860 and 2650 ng.h/mL after 0.2 mg/kg and 2140 and 2410 ng.h/mL after 0.15 mg/kg 
followed  by  0.2  mg/kg  at  age  of  2  months.  Therefore,  simulations  suggested  a  dose  of  0.15  mg/kg  for 
patients 20 days to <2 months old, ensuring that the exposure obtained in these young patients is well 
within the exposure range observed for older children, i.e. mean of 2130 on Day 14 and 2190 ng.h/mL on 
Day  28,  more  compliant  with  the  specified  exposure  cap  of  a  mean  AUC0-24,ss  of  2000  ng.h/mL. Despite 
these simulations results, the MAH has not provided additional data supporting the ontogeny of the flavin 
monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) enzyme, which could  be included in the final popPK model for more accurate 
predictions of risdiplam exposure in neonates below 20 days administered with risdiplam 0.15 mg/kg.

2.4.3.   Pharmacodynamics 
PD biomarkers (SMN protein and SMN2 mRNA) measured in blood samples from 7 children (4 with 2 SMN2 
copies, 2 with 3 copies and 1  with  ε 4 copies) who completed at least 12 months of treatment in Study 
BN40703 have shown the following individual measurements over time per patient: 
-  An overall trend towards increase  in SMN Protein in blood over time (Figure 21).  
Figure 21: Study BN40703: SMN protein in blood versus time

-  An  increase  trend  in  SMN2  mRNA  in  blood  over  time  (Figure  22)  and  a  concomitant  decrease  in 
SMN⊗7 mRNA in blood over time (Figure 23) that supports risdiplam’s mode of action (shift from 
the SMN⊗7 mRNA to full-length mRNA) in children from birth to 6 weeks

2.4.4.   Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical method 
The analytical method used to determine risdiplam, its main metabolite is the same used within the initial 
marketing authorisation application, and it has undergone a full validation in accordance with the current 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.1  Guideline  and  complies  with  it  in  terms  of  selectivity,  calibration 
curve, accuracy, precision, dilution integrity, matrix effect. No concerns are raised about the bioanalytical 
report  SPI_S_18080  relevant  to  RAINBOWFISH  study,  which  is  in  line  with  both  validation  and  above-
mentioned guideline. 
Clinical PK-PD  
In  order  to  compare  the  exposure  achieved  in  Study  BP39056  (FIREFISH)  and  Study  BN40703 
(RAINBOWFISH),  the  MAH  has  provided  only  a  graphical  representation,  with  only  simulated  data  being 
compared. 
The proposed oral dose (0.2 mg/kg) was selected for children from birth to 6 weeks of age, to the target 
exposure of mean AUC0-24h,ss ≤ 2000 ng•h/mL per protocol, instead, the estimated mean exposure for infants 
age 1 to 2 months in Study BN40703 was higher, i.e. 2500 ng•h/mL. The MAH was asked to justify the 
dose appropriateness in light of the discrepancy between the target AUC value of 2000 ng • h/mL (approved 
as cap in the PIP) and the observed higher median AUC value of 2500 ng • h/mL. This also considering that 
at least ¼ of patients for each time point have AUC values greater than 2000 ng • h/mL.  
During the procedure and as a response to the above-mentioned request, the MAH updated the PK analysis 
with  data  available  as  of  April  2022  from  all  26  patients  enrolled  into  Study  BN40703  (RAINBOWFISH), 
using the final reference popPK model. The new model is considered to better fit the combined data, based 
on the numerical stability, GOFs and pc-VPC. Based on the model, simulations suggested a dose of 0.15 
mg/kg for patients 20 days to <2 months old, ensuring that the exposure obtained in these young patients 
is  well  within  the  exposure  range  observed  for  older  children,  i.e.  mean  of  2130  on  Day  14  and  2190 
ng.h/mL on Day 28, more compliant with the specified exposure cap of a mean AUC0-24,ss of 2000 ng.h/mL. 
For the other age groups, it is proposed a dose of 0.20 mg/kg for patients from 2 months to <2 years of 
age, a dose of 0.25 mg/kg for patients ≥2 years of age (<20 kg) and a dose of 5 mg for patients ≥2 years 
of age (≥20 kg), which enable to attain a similar exposure.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/808679/2022 
Page 42/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During  the  procedure,  the  MAH  discussed  the  potential  involvement  of  the  FMO1  and  FMO3  activity 
modification in the target population. While it can be agreed that the higher than expected AUC levels could 
be a consequence of the expected reduced activity of FMO3 in paediatric patients < 2 months of age, the 
MAH acknowledged that there is a correlation between higher dose to risdiplam (in terms of AUC) and low 
levels of FMO3 in the children below 2 months of age Moreover, no additional data supporting the ontogeny 
of the FMO3 enzyme could be included in the final popPK model which could only be considered explorative 
as a full qualification and validation cannot be provided (mainly with respect to FMO3).  
From available PK data no recommendation on posology may be made below 20 days of age because only 
one 16 days old neonate received risdiplam at a considerably lower dose, compared to the one proposed 
for marketing. However, the MAH provided data on the use of risdiplam in patients below 20 days of age 
who were treated with risdiplam 0.15mg/kg once daily in countries where it is indicated from birth. Given 
the well-recognized need for an early initiation of treatment in SMA and the absence of safety signals in 
this subpopulation treated with the proposed dose of 0.15mg/kg/day, the CHMP agreed on recommending 
the 0.15mg/kg/day dose for newborns up to 2 months of age. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated 
to reflect the updated posology in patients 2 months of age and younger. Section 5.2 of the SmPC has also 
been updated with the new PK data. 
In  order  to  strengthen  the  confidence  on  the  optimal  recommended  dose  in  this  very  young  population,  
the MAH has developed Study BN44619 (PUPFISH) to assess the PK and safety of risdiplam in SMA patients 
from birth (day 1) to under 20 days of age at first dose. Study BN44619 (PUPFISH) has been added as 
additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP to enlarge evidence on the safety profile in patients below 
1 month of age – currently considered limited (see discussion on safety for further details).  
From a PD perspective, the MAH provided- upon request -median fold change from baseline for SMN protein 
in  Study  BN40703  (RAINBOWFISH).  However,  these  data  are  currently  difficult  to  interpret  for  Study 
BN40703, due to the small number of patients and limited follow-up duration. Further, literature indicates 
that SMN protein levels change in the first weeks and months of life, which would make the calculation of 
the  true  change  from  baseline  (which  occurs,  by  definition,  earlier  than  the  subsequent  post-treatment 
time-points) difficult, as the baseline shifts over time (Alves et al., 2020; Ramos et al., 2019). These interim 
data  are  therefore  not  comparable  with  the  previously  provided  SMN  protein  data  from  Study  BP39056 
(FIREFISH) and BP39055 (SUNFISH) in the SmPC for which SMN protein information was available from all 
patients for all timepoints up to at least one year of treatment. This information has been clarified in section 
5.1 (pharmacodynamic effects) of the SmPC. 
Finally, Exposure – Efficacy analyses have not been conducted due to the low number of patients enrolled 
and the very variable treatment duration, with limited follow-up. Upon request, the MAH provided exposure 
safety  correlations  with  updated  safety  data  (CCOD:  25  February  2022)  (see  below  Exposure-  Safety 
analysis in the Clinical safety section). 
2.4.5.  
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Although no recommendation on posology can be inferred for patients below 20 days of age based on PK 
data, the dose of 0.15mg/kg for this subpopulation can be agreed based on the well-recognized need for 
an  early  initiation  of  treatment  in  SMA  and  the  absence  of  safety  signals  in  this  subpopulation  already 
treated with the proposed dose of 0.15mg/kg/day in countries where risdiplam is indicated from birth.  
2.5.   Clinical efficacy 
Title of Study 
Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) 
Methods 
Study BN40703 is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical study to investigate the efficacy, safety, 
PK, and PD of risdiplam in patients aged from birth to 6 weeks (at first dose) who are genetically diagnosed 
with SMA (SMN1 deletion and any SMN2 copies) but not yet presenting with symptoms (Table 16). 
The study consists of a screening period, a treatment phase, an open-label extension phase of at least 36 
months (Month 24 up to Month 60) and a follow-up period, for a total treatment duration of at least 5 years 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

for each infant enrolled. During the treatment phase, all patients will receive risdiplam orally once daily for 
2 years at a dose selected to achieve the targeted exposure range. 
At the time of the application, the study is ongoing, and enrollment will continue until at least 25 patients 
are enrolled (including a minimum of 5 patients who meet the criteria for the primary efficacy population) 
or until a total of 10 patients who meet the criteria for the primary efficacy population are enrolled. The 
primary efficacy analysis population is defined as all infants in the intent-to-treat population with 2 SMN2 
copies (excluding the known SMN2 gene modifier mutation c.859G > C) and a baseline compound muscle 
action potential (CMAP) amplitude ε1.5 mV.  
This submission provides PK, PD, safety, and efficacy data from Study BN40703 at the time of an interim 
analysis (CCOD 1 July 2021 for PD, efficacy and safety data, and 31 August 2021 for PK data) in order to 
support the dose determination for patients below 2 months of age. The primary endpoint (sitting without 
support for 5 seconds, as assessed by Item 22 of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – 
Third Edition (BSID III) Gross Motor Scale)  was not evaluated at this time, in order to preserve the type 1 
error  for  the  future  primary  efficacy  analysis.  Interim  results  for  some  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  are 
presented,  including  data  from  the  Hammersmith  Infant  Neurological  Examination,  Module  2  (HINE-2), 
which includes an assessment of sitting.

The  MAH  sought  written  input  from  the  CHMP  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  in  May  2021  on  an  initial 
proposal for a variation to update the label based on the Study BN40703 interim analysis, and their feedback 
was supportive. Previous health authority feedback on the nonclinical, clinical, and technical development 
programs for risdiplam can be found in the original submission. 
Study BN40703 is being conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following: consensus ethical 
principles  derived  from  international  guidelines  including  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  Council  for 
International  Organizations  of  Medical  Sciences  International  Ethical  Guidelines,  applicable  ICH  Good 
Clinical Practice Guidelines, applicable laws and regulation. No audits were conducted for this study. 
Study participants 
The  RAINBOWFISH  Study  was  open  for  inclusion  of  infants  aged  from  birth  to  6 weeks,  with  genetically 
diagnosed presymptomatic SMA.  
Treatments 
A once daily oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg risdiplam was selected as the pivotal dose for Study BN40703 and was, 
therefore, initially proposed as the recommended dosing regimen for infants 16 days to 2 years of age.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  is  the  proportion  of  infants  who  are  sitting  without  support  after  12 
months of treatment, as assessed in Item 22 of the BSID III Gross Motor Scale. Per protocol, the primary 
efficacy analysis will be conducted when the last patient enrolled (irrespective of SMN2 copy number) has 
reached 12 months of treatment (expected in mid-2023). Results from BSID-III (primary endpoint) have 
not been provided in this analysis, in order to preserve the type 1 error for the primary endpoint.  
Similarly,  the  proportion  of  patients  developing  clinically  manifested  SMA  (listed  among  secondary 
endpoints)  has  not  been  reported  in  this    interim-CSR  as  the  definition  includes  motor  milestone 
development, one of which includes Item 22 of the BSID-III Gross Motor Scale. By SAP definition, clinically 
manifested  SMA,  also  includes  growth  measures.  Growth  measures  (listed  among  secondary  endpoints) 
have not been provided in this interim CSR. Also, respiratory endpoint (proportion of patients who do not 
receive any pulmonary care at month 12) (listed among secondary endpoints) have not been provided in 
this interim CSR. These results will be provided at the time of the primary analysis, when all patients have 
completed 12 months of treatment. 
Efficacy endpoints:  
●  Proportion of patients who achieve the attainment levels of the motor milestones assessed in the 
HINE-2 (at Month 12 of treatment) 
●  Change  from  baseline  in  the  Children’s  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  Infant  Test  of  Neuromuscular 
Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) motor function scale (at Month 12 of treatment)

Sample size 
The MAH changed the primary analysis population -due to the difficulty and slow enrolment in the ongoing 
RAINBOWFISH Study- from “at least 10 infants at inclusion with 2 SMN2 copies and a baseline CMAP ≥1.5  
evaluable for the primary endpoint” to: “at least 25 infants, including a minimum of 5 patients who meet 
the criteria for the primary efficacy population are enrolled OR a total of 10 infants who meet the criteria 
for the primary efficacy population are enrolled.  
This  interim  CSR  presents  data  from  the  first  18  patients  enrolled  at  the  time  of  the  CCOD,  including  7 
patients who had reached at least 12 months of treatment. 
Randomisation 
There was no randomisation as this was a non-controlled, open label trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
By design, there was no blinding.

Results 
Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 7 August 2019 and the CCOD for this report was on 1 July 2021. 
After almost 2 years of enrolment, out of 14 active sites, only 6 centres across 6 countries enrolled at least 
1 patient (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Russia, Taiwan, U.S.A.).As regards to sites from EU countries, out of 
the 4 active sites  (1 in Belgium and 1 in Italy and 2 sites in Poland), only the site from Belgium had enrolled 
at least 1 patient.   
Baseline data 
A total of 20 patients were screened for the study, of whom 2 patients were screening failures (2/20, 10%); 
reasons  for  screening  failure  was  not  provided  in  a  patient  from  Australia  and  was  unclear  (explanation 
provided: “Absence of clinical signs or symptoms at screening”) in a patient from Brazil.  
Overall,  18  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study  across  6  different  sites  in  6  countries.  2/18  were  Asian 
patients (both from Taiwan).  Only 2 patients from Belgium were enrolled in EU Countries.  Other 4 patients 
(included in the “Europe” Region) were enrolled in Russia. 6 further patients were enrolled in Australia, 1 
in US and 3 in Brazil. 
All  patients  received  treatment  with  risdiplam.  At  the  time  of  the  CCOD  for  this  report,  all  18  patients 
(100%) were still in the study, and 7 patients had completed 12 months of treatment. 
SMA identification occurred through: newborn screening in 13/18 (72%) of the enrolled newborns; family 
history (4/18, 22%) and other (1/18, patient, 6%). 
Overall, 10 patients had previous conditions. Prior conditions occurring in more than 1 patient were jaundice 
and abdominal pain. All other conditions occurred in single patients. One of the enrolled patients reported 
retinopathy  among  prior  diseases.  Only  one  patient  reported  SMA  as  congenital,  familial  and  genetic 
disorders (even though SMA identification occurred through family history in 4/18 of the enrolled patients) 
At  the  time  of  the  CCOD  for  this  report,  18  patients  (100%)  were  still  on  study,  and  7  patients  had 
completed  12  months  of  treatment.  No  patients  had  withdrawn  from  treatment,  reached  the  open  label 
extension (OLE) phase or entered the safety follow-up period at the time of this report. 
There  was  a  similar  number  of  male/female  patients  (44.4%/55.6%),  and  most  patients  (83.3%)  were 
White. The median age at first dose was 26.5 days (range: 16-40 days). 
Most patients (72.2%) were identified via newborn screening. Median scores at baseline were as follows: 
CHOP-INTEND: 49.0 (range: 35.0-58.0); HINE-2: 2.0 (range: 0.0-6.0); CMAP amplitude: 3.6 (range: 0.5-
6.7). 
Based on PK data (reported separately), the dose of risdiplam selected to achieve the target exposure was 
0.2 mg/kg. A total of 18 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. The median duration of 
treatment  exposure  was  8.7  months  (range:  0.5-22.8  months).  The  median  dose  intensity  was  100.4% 
(range: 97.3%-103.4%). All patients eventually received a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. 
Numbers analysed 
The efficacy data includes 7 patients (4 patients with 2 SMN2 copies, 2 patients with 3 SMN2 copies and 1 
patient with ≥4 SMN2 copies) who completed at least 12 months of treatment.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The efficacy data are reported in Table 18, Figure 26 and Figure 27 and summarized as follows:

●  The median HINE-2 total score change from baseline seen at Month 12 reflects the fact that patients 
had achieved meaningful gains in motor function. The low HINE-2 total scores seen at baseline reflects 
the age range of enrolled patients (6 weeks of age) 
●  Results on motor function as assessed by HINE-2: At Month 12 all patients were sitting without support. 
Six of 7 patients achieved the highest levels of sitting (pivot/rotate); the remaining 1 patient with 2 
SMN2 copies and baseline CMAP <1.5 mV achieved a stable sit. Six of 7 patients achieved the highest 
levels of rolling (supine to prone) and the remaining 1 patient with 2 SMN2 copies and baseline CMAP 
<1.5 mV achieved prone to supine rolling. Five of 7 patients could stand with support or stand unaided, 
the  other  2  patients,  both  with  2  SMN2  copies  and  baseline  CMAP  <1.5  mV  did  not  support  weight. 
Three of 7 patients (including 1 patient with 2 SMN2 copies and baseline CMAP >1.5 mV) were walking 
independently  and  1  patient  was  able  to  bounce  (the  remaining  3  patients  [2  patients  with  2  SMN2 
copies; 1 patient with 4 SMN2 copies] were not tested at Month 12). 
●  Results on motor function as assessed by CHOP-INTEND: Patients achieved high levels of motor function 
prior  to  Month  12,  with  10  of  13  patients  (76.9%;  90%  CI:  50.5,  93.4)  achieving  scores  of  ≥60  at 
Month 4 (Week 16). Four of 7 patients achieved the maximum score of 64 at Month 12. 
●  At baseline, the median CMAP amplitude for all patients (n=18) was 3.6 mV (range: 0.5-6.7 mV). Of 
the 7 patients who had reached Month 12 by the time of the CCOD, 5 of 7 patients showed an increase 
in CMAP amplitude between baseline and Month 12. The remaining 2 patients (both with 2 SMN2 copies) 
had the same CMAP amplitude at baseline and Month 12. 
●  Of the 7 patients who had reached Month 12 by the time of the CCOD, all patients (100%; 90% CI: 
65.2%, 100.0%) had the ability to feed orally. All patients (100%) were fed exclusively by mouth. 
●  Of the 7 patients who had reached Month 12 by the time of the CCOD, all patients (100%; 90% CI: 
65.2%, 100.0%) had the ability to swallow. All patients (100%) were able to swallow purees. At the 
time of the CCOD, 6 of 7 patients (85.7%) were reported to be able to swallow solid food. One patient 
(14.3%) with ≥4 SMN2 copies was reported to not be able to swallow solid food; however, after the 
CCOD, this was determined to be a data error and this patient was able to swallow solid food. Thus, all 
patients (100%) were able to swallow solid food at Month 12. 
●  No patients required any overnight hospitalization. 
●  All patients (100%) were alive without permanent ventilation at the time of the CCOD. 
Of the 4 patients with 2 SMN2 copies, 1 could stand unaided and walk independently, and 1 could stand 
with support and bounce at Month 12. The latter patient gained the ability to stand unaided and walk while 
holding on (“cruising”) by Month 18 of treatment (at the time of the CCOD). The remaining 2 patients with 
2 SMN2 copies had low CMAP amplitude values at baseline (0.46 and 0.6 mV). Despite this finding, both 
patients were developing complex motor abilities, such as rolling and crawling (1 patient crawled on elbow 
and 1 crawled flat on abdomen) after 12 months of risdiplam treatment (their last visit before the CCOD).  
Among the patients with 3 or ε4 SMN2 copies, 2 patients could stand unaided and walk independently, and 
1 patient could stand with support at Month 12. The latter patient (with ε4 SMN2 copies) gained the ability 
to stand unaided and walk independently by Week 64 (approximately Month 15) of treatment.

2.5.1.   Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This  variation  application  provides  data  from  Study  BN40703  at  the  time  of  an  interim  analysis  (CCOD 
1 July 2021) in patients below 2 months of age with presymptomatic SMA.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study design is adequate for this rare disorder and rarer in this age range.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy data from the 7 patients (4 patients with 2 SMN2 copies, 2 patients with 3 copies and 1 patient

with ε 4 copies)  who  completed  at  least  12 months  of  treatment  show  that,  most  patients  achieved 
important motor milestones and high levels of motor function. Specifically, patients treated with risdiplam 
for 12 months: 
●  Developed complex motor abilities as assessed by the HINE-2 scale, including all patients achieving the 
ability of sitting without support (HINE-2 categories of ‘Stable sit’ and ‘Pivots [rotates]’). 
●  Achieved high levels of motor function illustrated by the median score on the CHOP-INTEND equal to 
the maximum score of the assessment at Month 12. Even the 2 patients with a baseline CMAP amplitude 
< 1.5 mV increased their motor function over time. 
●  Maintained their abilities to feed orally and to swallow. 
●  Did not require any overnight hospitalization throughout the 12 months of treatment. 
●  Did not require permanent ventilation. 
The achievements were clearly not in line with the expected natural history of  SMA type I. 
The RAINBOWFISH study is enrolling pre-symptomatic patients, regardless of the number of SMN2 copies; 
however, the primary efficacy analysis is limited to the assessment of patients with two SMN2 copies (that 
are the patients who would most likely develop type 1 SMA, with onset before 6 months of age). Given the 
more heterogeneous phenotype in patients with ≥3 SMN2 copy numbers, a longer follow-up is needed to 
allow a meaningful interpretation of study results in this subgroup. This subgroup of patients is not foreseen 
to be included in the primary efficacy analysis of the RAINBOWFISH study. 
The trial inclusion criteria required: “gestational age of 37-42 weeks for singleton births; gestational age of 
34-42 weeks for twins”. Body weight ≥3rd percentile for age, using appropriate country-specific guidelines. 
The lowest baseline weight of enrolled patients was 3.076 kg. The median age at first dose was 26.5 days 
(range: 16-40 days). During the procedure, the MAH was requested to clarify if there is data available in 
preterm  neonates.  During  the  procedure,  the  MAH  proposed  to  take  into  account  the  aforementioned 
inclusion criteria by relying on the concept of corrected age, which better reflects the stage of maturation 
of the infant if they are born prematurely. This was agreed and specified in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The 
information on the weight range of the enrolled infants is provided in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
On 30 July 2021 the MAH submitted a request for a modification of the agreed PIP, proposing a change in 
the  number  of  patients  included  in  the  primary  analysis  population  of  the  RAINBOWFISH  study  and  a 
deferral of the end of the study. The minimum number of patients for the primary analysis population was 
changed from “at least 10 infants at inclusion with 2 SMN2 copies and a baseline CMAP ≥1.5 evaluable for 
the primary endpoint” to: “at least 25 infants, including a minimum of 5 patients who meet the criteria for 
the primary efficacy population are enrolled OR a total of 10 infants who meet the criteria for the primary 
efficacy population are enrolled”). The rationale for these changes were primarily due to the slower than 
expected  enrolment,  due  to  the  increased  competitive  setting  with  two  SMN-targeted  therapies  recently 
approved in SMA, added to risdiplam availability. After almost 2 years of enrolment (out of 14 active sites, 
only 6 centers enrolled at least 1 patient). As regards to sites from EU countries, out of 4 active sites (1 
each from Belgium and Italy and 2 sites in Poland), only 1 site (from Belgium) enrolled at least 1 patient. 
Possibly COVID-19 pandemic may have played a role in the difficulties in enrolment. 
As commented by the PDCO Rapporteur and by the Paediatric Coordinator at the time of the EMA/PDCO 
Modification report, a minimum of 7 neonates/young infants meeting the criteria for the primary efficacy 
population with at least 2 achieving the primary endpoint should be kept for the primary analysis, in order 
to  maintain  power  above  80%.  Thus,  it  is  agreed  with  the  PDCO  Rapporteur  and  with  the  Paediatric 
Coordinator to keep a minimum of 7 pre-symptomatic neonates and young infants with 2 SMN2 copies and 
a  baseline  CMAP  ≥1.5  mV  (=who  meet  the  criteria  for  the  primary  efficacy  population),  and  at  least  25 
infants,  to  be  enrolled  prior  to  study  completion  (OR  a  total  of  10  infants  who  meet  the  criteria  for  the 
primary efficacy population, as initially pre-specified). A total of 25 patients would be welcome, and is not 
mutually exclusive with the 10 patients evaluable for primary efficacy. ”. During the procedure, the MAH 
confirmed the recruitment was closed in February 2022 due to feasibility issues with a total of 26 patients 
enrolled (8 patients with 2 SMN2 copies and 5 patients with 2 SMN2 copies and CMAP ≥ 1.5 mV). The MAH 
confirmed that none of the 8 patients with 2 SMN2 copies enrolled in the Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) 
carries the SMN2 gene modifier mutation c.859G > C. The baseline CMAP is not considered a critical issue 
by the MAH. A minimum of 7 pre-symptomatic neonates and young infants who meet the criteria for the 
primary  efficacy  population  (=with  2  SMN2  copies  and  a  baseline  CMAP  ≥1.5  mV)  would  have  been 
preferable, as it would have allowed to maintain power above 80%. 
In  the  submitted  interim  analysis  of  the  RAINBOWFISH  study,  the  primary  focus  is  not  efficacy  but  PK 
evaluation,  to  support  dose  determination  for  patients  below  2  months  of  age.  As  discussed  by  PDCO 
Rapporteur at the time of the EMA/PDCO Modification report, the minimum required number of patients 
submitted in this interim analysis is no longer based, at this step, on primary endpoint and statistical power 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/808679/2022

but  on  a  sufficient  number  of  patients  (not  especially  meeting  the  criteria  for  the  primary  efficacy 
population)  required  for  an  appropriate  PK  dose  finding.  In  this  interim-analysis,  results  from  BSID-III 
(primary endpoint) have not been provided, to preserve the type 1 error for the primary endpoint.  Similarly, 
the proportion of patients developing clinically manifested SMA, growth measures and respiratory endpoint 
included as secondary endpoints  have not been provided in this interim CSR. These results will be provided 
at the time of the primary analysis when all patients have completed 12 months of treatment. 
As already discussed at the time of the Marketing Authorization (please refer to risdiplam EPAR) - it may 
be  acknowledged  that  the  overall  findings  of  the  risdiplam  studies  and  the  literature  support  the  early 
initiation of treatment with risdiplam. The uncertainties of such extrapolation of the data from symptomatic 
patients to pre- or pauci-symptomatic patients that have not yet reached the criteria for clinical diagnosis 
are also expected to be clarified by the data generated in the agreed PAES (see Annex II). 
The efficacy data has shown similitude to the older infant efficacy data. However, given the heterogeneity 
of  the  expected  phenotype  in  patients  with  3  and  especially  4  SMN2  copies,  a  follow  up  longer  than  12 
months is needed. In pre-symptomatic patients with 4 copies a follow up longer than 24 months is needed 
in order to assess if patients deviate from the natural history of untreated SMA patients. Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC has been updated with efficacy data from pre-symptomatic SMA population (RAINBOWFISH).  
During  the  procedure,  the  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  Roche  Global  Safety  Database  and  the  United 
States Evrysdi patient access database, which, as of 8MAY2023 had included 47 babies below 20 days of 
age  treated  with  risdiplam.  The  MAH  contacted  U.S.  physicians’  and  received  orally  their  experience 
regarding 12 newborns below 20 days of age at the time of risdiplam treatment start. The physicians orally 
reported  that  treated  newborns  did  well  on  risdiplam,  progressed  normally,  and  reached  milestones  on 
time. 
2.5.2.   Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is acknowledged that there is evidence - both from the risdiplam studies as well as studies with other 
disease modifying drugs- that earlier treatment initiation is associated with better clinical outcomes. For 
this reason, extrapolation of efficacy from symptomatic to pre- or pauci-symptomatic patients that have 
not yet reached the criteria for clinical diagnosis has been accepted since the initial marketing authorization. 
The preliminary efficacy results provided for some of the secondary endpoints in this interim analysis of the 
RAINBOWFISH Study in the 4 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies with a 12-months follow-up also support the 
early initiation of treatment with risdiplam. 
2.6.   Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Clinical safety was also assessed in the RAINBOWFISH study. The observed safety profile up to the CCOD 
was reflective of the age of the patients.  
Patient exposure 
Based on PK data (reported separately), the dose of risdiplam selected to achieve the target exposure was 
0.2 mg/kg. A total of 18 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. The median duration of 
treatment  exposure  was  8.7  months  (range:  0.5-22.8  months).  The  median  dose  intensity  was  100.4% 
(range: 97.3%-103.4%). All patients eventually received a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. 
Overall,  14 patients  (77.8%)  received  at  least  one  concomitant  medication1  in  the  study.  The  most 
frequently  reported  concomitant  medications  (in  ε5 patients)  were:  Paracetamol  (9 patients  [50.0%]); 
Rotavirus  vaccine 
live  oral  1v  (7 patients  [38.9%]);  Ibuprofen  (6 patients  [33.3%]);  “6-in-1 
DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine” (refer to listing for full WHO Drug term) (6 patients [33.3%]); Pneumococcal 
vaccine conj 13v (crm197) (6 patients [33.3%]) 
1 Concomitant medications with a start date on, or after first dose date.

Adverse events 
In one subject a Grade 3 AE of cystoid macular edema was reported (observed at Spectral Domain Optical 
Coherence  Tomography  (SD-OCT)  considered  clinically  significant  and  reported  as  AE);  the  Investigator 
assessed the event as unrelated to risdiplam treatment. The event was reported at week 8 (day 60) as a 
new cystoid macular edema (not present at baseline) in both eyes assessed as clinically significant. At week 
13 (day 97) the event resolved. See below section.  
Overall,  7  patients  (38.9%)  had  at  least  1  AE  coding  to  the  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  Skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders. None of the 12 events were serious or led to a change in study medication. 
An event of non-serious skin discoloration (Grade 1) over the neck and back (whitish discoloration) (see 
below).  
Overall, 9 patients (50.0%) had at least 1 AE coding to the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders. None of the 24 
events were serious or led to a change in study medication. Two patients experienced a total of 2 treatment-
related AEs (Diarrhoea: Grade 1, nonserious and Skin discoloration: Grade 1, non-serious). 
When adjusted for patient-years at risk, the overall AE rate at the time of the CCOD was 558.2 events per 
100 patient-years (PY) (90% CI: 460.3, 671.5; total PY at risk: 14.5 years). 
The safety profile of risdiplam was comparable in patients who initiated therapy at <4 weeks of age and 
those who initiated therapy between > 4 to <6 weeks of age. 
Haematological  parameters  were  stable  over  time.  Isolated  shifts  were  observed  in  some  patients  but 
returned to normal without change to study medication. Isolated shifts in other laboratory parameters were 
observed; however, these were not sustained over time and generally were not clinically significant. 
No  Hy’s  law  cases  were  observed.  No  AEs  were  reported  in  the  SOC  Hepatobiliary  disorders.  No  AEs 
suggestive  of  liver  abnormalities  were  reported  in  the  SOC  Investigations.  Increased  liver  enzymes  as 
laboratory findings occurred frequently (≤ 2x Upper limit of normal (ULN) bilirubin and ALT; ≤3 x ULN AST), 
and in particular AST elevation was sustained, with values not returned to within normal values at last visit: 
7/18  patients  (39%)  had  AST  or  ALT elevations  post-baseline  (<  2x  ULN))  [where  baseline  values  were 
either normal (3 patients) or unknown (4 patients)] which had not returned to within normal ranges at the 
last assessment (in 6/6 patients with AST elevation, AST had not returned to within normal values at last 
visit;  1/4  patients  with  ALT  elevation,  ALT  had  not  returned  to  within  normal  values  at  last  visit).  2/18 
patients (11%) with normal bilirubin values at baseline, had elevated direct bilirubin levels (< 2x ULN) at 
Week  2,  after  which  their  direct  bilirubin  levels  returned  to  within  normal  range  at  consequent  tests.  In 
most patients (2/2 bilirubin increase and 4/7 ALT and AST increase) increases started at week 2 (Day 14 
or 15). 
Isolated  shifts  in  diastolic  blood  pressure,  systolic  blood  pressure,  temperature  and  pulse  rate  were 
observed; however, these were generally not sustained over time and were not clinically significant. The 
ECG data showed no clinically significant trends post-baseline versus baseline in mean ECG parameters. No 
AEs were reported in the SOC Cardiac disorders. 
Seven of 18 patients (38.9%) were followed up with an SD-OCT assessment until at least 12 months. The 
longest follow-up was 78 weeks (achieved by 4 patients). Signs of retinal immaturity were observed in 50% 
of patients and resolved as expected with age in those with sufficient follow-up. 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 AE was 77.8% (14 patients). Overall, there were 81 AEs reported. 
The AEs reported were as would be expected for infants of this age. 
The majority of AEs were not considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment; related AEs 
resolved or were resolving despite ongoing treatment with risdiplam.

Table 19: Overview of Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
Investigator text for AEs is coded using MedDRA version 24.0. Percentages are based on N in the column headings. Multiple occurrences 
of the same AE in one individual are counted only once except for "Total number of AEs" row in which multiple occurrences of the same 
AE are counted separately. Includes AEs with onset from first dose of study drug up to the clinical cutoff date. Safety-evaluable patients 
have received at least one dose of study drug. Clinical Cut-Off Date: 01JUL2021 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Up to the CCOD, no deaths, no SAEs and no AEs of Grade ε4 were reported. 
Despite  the  limited  data,  no  differences  were  observed  in  the  safety  profile  of  risdiplam  in  patients  who 
initiated therapy at δ4 weeks of age and those who initiated between > 4 to δ6 weeks of age. There were 
no events or findings suggestive of risdiplam-induced effects on hematological parameters.

Although it is acknowledged that the limited number of patients do not allow to draw definitive conclusions, 
when observing the outcome of AEs, it is noted that a higher proportion of AEs in patients with ≥4 copies 
(6/24, 25%) had an unresolved” outcome, in comparison to patients with a lower number of SMN2 copies 
(2 copies: 1/ 21, 5%; and 3 copies 3/31, 10%). The lower median treatment duration of the subgroup of 
patients with ≥4 copies (3.93 months), in comparison to patients with a lower number of copies (2 copies: 
11.96 months; 3 copies: 8.94 months) could possibly have a role. However, also when observing AE rate 
adjusted for patient years at risk (that takes into account the different time of exposure), the number of 
adverse  events  per  100  patient-years  (90%  CI)  are  higher  in  the  subgroup  ≥4  SMN2  copies  [926.64 
(638.96,  1303.18)]  in  comparison  to  the  subgroups  with  a  lower  number  of  SMN2  copies,  with  non-
overlapping 90% CI when compared to the subgroup with 2 SMN 2 copies [352.90 (238.91, 503.92)]. 
Data  are  considered  too  limited  to  draw  definitive  conclusions.  The  MAH  is  monitoring  safety  data  in  all 
ongoing studies. In the event of a potential signal, signal evaluation will include an analysis of the impact 
of  underlying  SMA  severity.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  plans  to  provide  an  analysis  of  safety  by  SMN  copy 
number subgroups in the planned final CSR of all the ongoing clinical studies. 
Two patients experienced a total of 2 treatment-related AEs (diarrhoea: Grade 1, nonserious, onset at Day 
15 and resolved after 15 days without change to study treatment; and Skin discoloration: Grade 1, non-
serious, onset at Day 29 and resolving at the time of the CCOD without change to study treatment).  
Ophthalmology AE 
One  retinal  abnormality  was  assessed  as  a  clinically  significant  change  compared  with  baseline  and  was 
reported as an AE which was also attributed to retinal immaturity and resolved under continued risdiplam 
therapy. The MAH discussed the Grade 3 AE of cystoid macula edema observed at SD-OCT upon request. 
The MAH reports that central reader assessed that the changes in this patient do not follow the pattern of 
abnormality observed in preclinical studies in which all changes started in the retinal periphery especially 
the  outer  nuclear  layers  and  retinal  pigment  epithelium.  The  event  resolved  while  continuing  risdiplam

treatment.  The  Investigator  assessed  the  event  as  unrelated  to  risdiplam  treatment.  Although  the  new 
cystoid  macular  edema  started  after  risdiplam  treatment  and  thus  a  possible  causal  relationship  with 
treatment may not be definitely excluded, it is acknowledged that given the resolution of the event despite 
the continued risdiplam treatment, retinal immaturity could be a possible alternative explanation. The MAH 
provided a safety analysis by exposure quartiles. The infant with the AE of cystoid macular edema  was in 
the  higher  exposure  quartile  (AUC  value  at  week  4:  3790).  During  the  procedure,  the  MAH  proposed  a 
lower dose (0.15 mg/kg) for infants <2 months of age based on updated popPK analysis. This is reassuring, 
as it is not expected that patients <2 months of age will be exposed to a risdiplam dose corresponding to 
the highest quartile of exposure in the RAINBOWFISH study (AUC value at week 4: >3070-4580).  
AE of the Skin and Other Events Potentially Linked to Effects on Epithelial Tissues 
An  event  of  non-serious  skin  discoloration  (Grade  1)  over  the  neck  and  back  (whitish  discoloration) 
considered by the Investigator to be related to risdiplam. The event occurred on Study Day 29. On Study 
Day  168,  discoloration  over  back  had  disappeared;  but  discoloration  over  neck  persisted.  There  was  no 
change  in  study  drug  due  to  this  event.  Among  risdiplam  important  potential  risks  in  the  RMP  there  is 
“Effect on epithelial tissue”. The MAH provided an update on the outcome of this event upon request. The 
MAH  stated  that  the  AE  recovered  on  Study  Day  263  without  any  additional  treatment  prescribed  and 
without  any  change  to  study  medication.  The  patient  was  seen  by  a  dermatologist,  but  it  is  currently 
unknown  if  diagnostic  measures  were  taken  to  establish  a  more  precise  diagnosis.  Hypopigmentation 
macules  are  very  common  (both  in  children  and  adults)  and  that  the  clinical  presentation  of  this  event 
(hypopigmentation of the skin) as well as the resolution of the event despite ongoing risdiplam strongly 
suggest that the event reported in this patient is distinct from the findings observed in nonclinical studies. 
It may be acknowledged that the resolution of the event despite ongoing risdiplam treatment may point in 
the direction of an alternative explanation.  
AE coding to the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders 
In RAINBOWFISH study there were 6 AEs of diarrhoea reported in 6 patients (6/6= 2.3%). Diarrhoea is 
already included as a very common adverse drug reaction in both early-onset and late-onset SMA. In the 
poster  presentation  describing  preliminary  results  of  the  RAINBOWFISH  Study,  submitted  during  this 
procedure, one SAE of gastroenteritis norovirus was reported that was not discussed in the interim CSR. 
The MAH clarified that gastroenteritis was downgraded to non-serious. The MAH further reviewed the events 
of diarrhoea in RAINBOWFISH and in FIREFISH studies and concluded that clinical presentation of diarrhoea 
AEs  in  Study  BN40703  (RAINBOWFISH)  is  consistent  with  observations  of  diarrhoea  in  patients  with 
symptomatic SMA in Study BP39056 (FIREFISH).  
Laboratory findings 
In the submitted CSR, no Hy’s law cases were observed. No AEs were reported in the SOC Hepatobiliary 
disorders. No AEs suggestive of liver abnormalities were reported in the SOC Investigations. 
In  the  poster  presentation  describing  preliminary  results  of  the  RAINBOWFISH  Study,  submitted  for  the 
procedure  two  related  AEs  of  increased  ALT  and  increased  AST  (both  reported  in  one  infant)  have  been 
described. These events were later updated and were not discussed in the interim CSR as presented in the 
poster. This was justified by the MAH upon signaling. 
Exposure- Safety analysis 
During the first 6 months of treatment, the overall AE rate was 681.0 events per 100PY (90% CI: 526.2, 
868.4; total PY at risk: 6.9 years). This decreased to a rate of 401.1 events per 100PY during the second 
6 months on treatment (90% CI: 255.6, 601.7; total PY at risk: 4.2 years). 
Upon request, the MAH provided exposure safety correlations with updated safety data (CCOD: 25 February 
2022). The MAH provided an analysis of AEs, SAEs, and safety laboratory parameters by exposure quartiles: 
the 26 infants enrolled into Study BN40703 were allocated into 4 groups based on their AUC observed at 
Week 4, i.e. exposure quartiles, and safety data was compared across the quartiles. The MAH considers the 
AUC value at Week 4 the “worst case” as it is in general the highest value: as risdiplam accumulates with 
continued administration, the exposure reaches steady-state approximately 2 to 4 weeks after treatment 
start, and then generally declines for most infants as they mature and grow. As the exposure to risdiplam 
is dependent on the general maturation of the infants and in particular maturation of liver function, patients 
in the lower exposure quartiles (Quartiles 1 and 2) tended to be slightly older (mean age 30 days) than the 
patients in the higher exposure quartiles (Quartiles 3 and 4) (mean age 25 days). The only 2 Grade 3 AEs, 
occurred one (cystoid macular oedema) in a patient in the highest exposure quartile (>3070-4580) and the

other  (gastroenteritis  norovirus)  in  a  patient  in  the  first  exposure  quartile  (541-1910).  The  only  2  SAEs 
(neonatal jaundice and gastroenteritis) were both reported in two patients in the highest exposure quartile 
(>3070-4580).  Even  though  the  investigator  considered  these  two  events  as  not  related  to  risdiplam, 
considering the limited available data, it is not possible to exclude a worst safety in the highest quartile of 
risdiplam exposure  (AUC at 4 weeks: >3070-4580). Nevertheless, the MAH has finally proposed a lower 
dose  (0.15  mg/kg)  for  infants  <2  months  of  age  based  on  updated  popPK  analysis.  This  is  considered 
reassuring,  as  it  is  not  expected  that  patients  <2  months  of  age  will  be  exposed  to  a  risdiplam  dose 
corresponding to the highest quartile of exposure in the RAINBOWFISH study (AUC value at week 4: >3070-
4580). 
Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  has  been  updated  with  safety  data  from  pre-symptomatic  SMA  population 
(RAINBOWFISH). 
Overdose 
At the time of the CCOD, 4 patients (22.2%) were reported to have received  ε 10% above the planned 
dose (defined as an overdose). In 2 patients (11.1%) the overdoses were single occurrences; in the other 
2 patients the overdoses were determined to be noted in error.  
Of  the  4  patients  who  had  an  overdose,  AEs  of  Accidental  overdose  were  reported  for  2  patients.  The 
overdose in these patients did not lead to any other AEs. The other 2 patients were reported (at the time 
of the CCOD) to have doses that were 10% above the planned dose; however, these were determined to 
be discrepancies due to  data entry error relating to recording of the patients’ weights. The actual doses 
received by the patients were correct per protocol dosing regimen. 
No cases of overdose were associated with any AEs due to risdiplam.    
Post Marketing Data   
Risdiplam is currently approved in the U.S., E.U. and over 90 international markets for the treatment of 
SMA. Since the International Birth Date (7 August 2020) through 6 August 2021 (data lock point for the 
Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report [PBRER]), an estimated total of 2728 patients received risdiplam 
from marketing experience (European Economic Area [EEA] n = 433; Rest of the World n = 2295). Exposure 
was similar between the sexes (male n = 1363; female n = 1363; unknown n = 1).  
Based  on  the  evaluation  of  these  data,  one  new  identified  risk  (cutaneous  vasculitis)  not  categorized  as 
important was identified. The information that became available did not alter the known benefit-risk profile 
of risdiplam. The benefit-risk profile of risdiplam in the authorized indication remains favorable. 
The worldwide exposure in patients below 20 days of age is unknown. However, in the United States, per 
the Evrysdi patient access database, as of 8 May 2023, 47 babies below 20 days of age have been prescribed 
risdiplam. Data submitted upon response to the 3rd RfSI covered 8 neonates identified in the MAH safety 
database.  While  some  patients  had  adverse  events,  the  single  SAEs  of  cardiac  arrhythmia  and  troponin 
value  elevated  and  the  non-serious  event  of  icterus  prolungatus  occurred  in  a  child  who  had  been  just 
treated with gene therapy and was also receiving risdiplam. The outcome of these events was resolved; it 
is not known if therapy with risdiplam was altered or not in response to these events. There were two other 
children with diarrhoea described as non-serious AEs.  
2.6.1.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
No deaths or SAEs occurred up to the CCOD for the interim analysis. No new risks were identified following 
the review of the type and frequency of AEs as well as vital signs, physical examinations, ECG. 
Upon request, the MAH provided updated safety data from RAINBOWFISH study (CCOD: 25 February 2022). 
Eight more patients have been enrolled, thus safety data from 26 patients <2 months of age who received 
at least 4 weeks of risdiplam treatment are now available. Since the previous CCOD, two new SAEs occurred 
(neonatal  jaundice  and  gastroenteritis),  both  grade  1,  resolved  without  study  drug  interruption  and 
considered not related to study drug by the investigator. Furthermore, since the previous CCOD, two new 
related  AEs  occurred  (Grade  1  non-serious  Diarrhoea,  resolved  after  4  days,  without  change  to  study 
treatment; one Incorrect dose administered: Grade not stated, non-serious, onset at Day 1 and resolved 
after 13 days. No additional AE was reported due to this incorrect dose administered.  
The only 2 SAEs were both reported in two patients in the highest exposure quartile at week 4 (>3070-
4580), with both SAEs occurring in proximity to week 4. Even though the investigator considered these two 
events  as  not  related  to  risdiplam,  considering  the  limited  available  data,  it  is  not  possible  to  exclude  a 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/808679/2022 
Page 56/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
worst safety in the highest quartile of risdiplam exposure  (AUC at 4 weeks: >3070-4580). Nevertheless, 
the MAH finally proposed a lower dose (0.15 mg/kg) for infants <2 months of age based on updated PK 
analysis. This may be considered reassuring from a safety perspective, as it is not expected that patients 
<2 months of age will be exposed to a risdiplam dose corresponding to the highest quartile of exposure in 
the RAINBOWFISH study.  
The limited post marketing exposure in countries where the dose of 0.15 mg/kg was approved in children 
aged 0-20 days of life has not triggered safety signals and seems consistent with the approved treatment 
2 months and above. 
Given the well-recognized need for an early initiation of treatment in SMA and the lack of safety signals on 
newborns already treated with 0.15mg/kg, the indication from birth has been accepted.  
However, safety in patients <1 month of age has been added as missing information in the RMP due to the 
extremely limited evidence available in this patient population that represent the most vulnerable subgroup 
of the paediatric population and the need to further strengthen the confidence on the optimal recommended 
dose in this very young population.  
The MAH proposed to include the PK study BN44619 (PUPFISH) as an additional pharmacovigilance activity 
(category  3  PASS)  in  the  RMP.  A  total  of  10  patients  are  expected  to  be  enrolled,  with  a  minimum  of 3 
patients aged < 7 days at first dose, in order to generate  data in the most  vulnerable  phase right after 
birth. The MAH has committed to provide regular updates in upcoming PSURs on the progress of the PK 
study BN44619 (PUPFISH).  
Further, the MAH has committed to collect data in the real world setting in very young patients through a 
retrospective chart review, Study ML44811. The study is a retrospective chart review data collection from 
clinicians across multiple centers in the US who have initiated treatment with risdiplam in newborn infants 
with SMA younger than 2 months, between May 2022 and the study cutoff date (date to be set at protocol 
finalization). Research coordinators who are doing the chart abstraction will be provided with a standard 
template to collect required data for this descriptive real world study. Sample size is expected to be up to 
50 patients from across the US.  
The primary objective for this study is to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics (including 
dose,  age  at  diagnosis,  SMN2  copy  number,  etc.)  at  the  initiation  of  treatment  with  risdiplam  of  SMA 
newborns (0-2 months old) in the U.S. to date.  
If feasibility is confirmed, the planned secondary objectives for this study, ideally at a 1 year follow-up time 
point is as follows: 
● 
● 
To describe risdiplam use and SMA disease-modifying treatment patterns post risdiplam initiation. 
In order to collect the most relevant adverse events in these patients, the chart review will extract all 
hospitalizations (including date of admission, length of stay) and reasons for hospitalisation. 
Given  that  site  enrollment  is  unpredictable  as  there  are  many  ongoing  SMA  studies  competing  for  site 
resources, an exact timeline for this study read-out cannot be ascertained at this point in time. 
The MAH’s proposal for real-world data is endorsed and the MAH was made aware that data from this study 
is needed, since the presently discussed positive benefit-risk balance is based on the hypothetical benefit 
of  risdiplam  being  higher  than  the  risk  of  the  very  early  use.  Therefore,  to  substantiate  this  theoretical 
reasoning, RWE is required, and should be presented as early as possible. Otherwise, should safety issues 
emerge on the early usage in the absence of supportive efficacy and safety (for contextualisation on the 
frequency of safety issues), the use on the very young must be revised. 
2.6.2.  
Conclusions on clinical safety 
Limited safety data is available in neonates and young infants with pre-symptomatic SMA (n=18 up to the 
CCOD for the interim analysis). 
Given  the  limited  available  data  and  due  to  neonates  representing  the  most  vulnerable  subgroup  of  the 
paediatric  population,  all  single  AE  with  an  at  least  reasonable  possibility  of  a  causal  relationship  with 
risdiplam are considered relevant. Available data in neonates and young infants <2 months of age do not 
provide enough reassurance on the absence of a clinically relevant unfavourable effect of the higher-than-
expected median AUC observed in the interim analysis of the RAINBOWFISH study. Nevertheless, the new 
proposed lower dose (0.15mg/kg) for infants <2 months is considered reassuring, and it can be accepted 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/808679/2022 
Page 57/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that there are no major safety concerns for infants aged at birth and above, treated with the lower dose of 
0.15mg/kg.  
However, safety in patients <1 month of age has been added as missing information in the RMP. The MAH 
proposed to include the PK study BN44619 (PUPFISH) as an additional pharmacovigilance activity (category 
3 PASS) in the RMP and has committed to provide regular updates in upcoming PSURs on the progress of 
the PK study BN44619 (PUPFISH). Further, the MAH has committed to conduct a real-world data collection 
in newborn infants with SMA younger than 2 months who have initiated treatment with risdiplam in the US 
(Study ML44811) to support the benefit risk in this subpopulation. 
2.6.3.  
PSUR cycle

2.8.   Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  make 
some editorial improvements in the product information. 
As a consequence of the variation to update Evrysdi pack configuration with the addition of a new 1 mL 
oral  syringe  into  the  product  carton  allowing  precise  dosing  of  infants  below  2  months  of  age  and  the  , 
variation  to  remove  the  spare  unit  of  12  mL  oral  syringe  out  of  the  two  units  currently  provided  in  the 
product carton, section 6.5 of the SmPC has been updated and the labelling and Package Leaflet have been 
updated in accordance. 
2.8.1.  
User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: there are few 
changes included in the PL and IFU, and these changes do not introduce any new safety message and there 
is no new information that impacts the general readability of the PL for users.

3.   Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.   Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.   Disease or condition 
SMA is a monogenic neuromuscular disorder resulting in severe weakness of the limbs, trunk, bulbar and 
respiratory muscles secondary to the dysfunction of alpha motor neurons within the anterior horn of the 
spinal cord, leading to skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. Clinically, patients may experience failure to 
gain  motor  milestones  and  motor  function,  recurrent  respiratory  infections,  swallowing  difficulties, 
contractures, scoliosis, and reduced life expectancy. It is the most frequent cause of inherited death in early 
childhood.  The  severity  of  spinal  muscular  atrophy  is  highly  variable  and  patients  with  heterogeneous 
clinical features can be classified into phenotypes (Types 0 through 4) on the basis of age at onset and the 
most advanced motor milestone achieved during development. 
This variation application provides interim results from Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) in order to support 
the risdiplam dose determination for patients below 2 months of age. 
3.1.2.   Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For  patients  with  SMA  below  2  months  of  age,  there  are  currently  two  approved  therapies:  Spinraza® 
(nusinersen)  and  Zolgensma®  (onasemnogene  abeparvovec).  Spinraza  is  an  SMN2-directed  antisense 
oligonucleotide  administered  intrathecally,  thus  largely  limiting  the  effects  to  the  CNS  only.  The  first  3 
loading  doses  of  Spinraza  are  administered  at  14-day  intervals, followed  by  a  4th  loading  dose  after  30 
days  and  maintenance  dose  every  4  months  thereafter.  Zolgensma  is  a  one-time  intravenously 
administered gene-replacement therapy that uses a nonreplicating AAV capsid to deliver a functional copy 
of  the  SMN1  gene.  High-dose,  systemic  corticosteroid  treatment  is  required  prior  to  and  following 
Zolgensma administration. 
Despite the availability of these therapies, there remains an unmet medical need for additional treatment 
options  for  patients  below  2  months  of  age,  especially  when  considering  prompt  treatment  initiation. 
Specific factors contributing to the current unmet medical need: 
●  Required  hospital  setting  for  Zolgensma  and  Spinraza  administration  presents  challenges  for 
patients; 
●  Zolgensma administration may be delayed in patients with elevated anti-AAV9 antibody titers or 
infections; 
●  Safety risks are associated with Zolgensma therapy and concomitant corticosteroid treatment;

The  main  clinical  study  submitted  in  this  application  is  an  interim  CSR  of  the  ongoing  RAINBOWFISH 
(BN40703) study, which is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical study to investigate the efficacy, 
safety, PK, and PD of risdiplam in patients aged from birth to 6 weeks (at first dose) who are genetically 
diagnosed with SMA (SMN1 deletion and any SMN2 copies) but not yet presenting with symptoms. 
3.2.   Favourable effects 
Most treated children have reached milestones which could not be attained by children with 2 SMN2 copies 
as known from natural history cohorts.  
No  new  favourable  effect  was  identified  in  this  population  that  had  not  been  observed  with  the  older 
population. 
3.3.   Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study was noncontrolled.

The RAINBOWFISH study is enrolling pre-symptomatic patients, regardless of the number of SMN2 copies; 
however, the primary efficacy analysis is limited to the assessment of patients with two SMN2 copies (that 
are the patients who would most likely develop type 1 SMA, with onset before 6 months of age). Given the 
heterogeneity of the expected phenotype in patients with 3 and especially 4 SMN2 copies and given the 
limited number of patients enrolled, a follow up longer than 12 months is needed in order to assess if the 
2 patients with pre-symptomatic SMA with 3 SMN2 copies and the only patient with ≥4 SMN2 copies treated 
with risdiplam in the RAINBOWFISH study, deviate from the natural history of untreated SMA patients. 
Due to the slower than expected enrolment, due to the increased competitive setting with two SMN-targeted 
therapies  recently  approved  in  SMA,  on  30  July  2021  the  MAH  submitted  to  the  EMA  a  request  for  a 
modification  of  the  agreed  PIP,  proposing  a  change  in  the  number  of  patients  included  in  the  primary 
analysis  population  of  the  RAINBOWFISH  study.  The  primary  analysis  population  was  changed  from  “at 
least  10  infants  at  inclusion  with  2  SMN2  copies  and  a  baseline  CMAP  ≥1.5  evaluable  for  the  primary 
endpoint” to: “at least 25 infants, including a minimum of 5 patients who meet the criteria for the primary 
efficacy  population  are  enrolled  OR  a  total  of  10  infants  who  meet  the  criteria  for  the  primary  efficacy 
population are enrolled”). However, a minimum of 7 neonates/young infants meeting the criteria for the 
primary  efficacy  population  should  have  been  kept  for  the  primary  analysis,  in  order  to  maintain  power 
above 80%.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  relevant  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (e.g.  development  of  SMA, 
respiratory endpoint) have not been reported in this interim CSR, only secondary efficacy endpoints have 
been included. However, the primary focus in the submitted interim analysis of the RAINBOWFISH study is 
not efficacy but PK evaluation, in order to support dose determination for patients below 2 months of age. 
The  minimum  required  number  of  patients  submitted  in  this  interim  analysis  is  no  longer  based,  at  this 
step,  on  primary  endpoint  and  statistical  power  but  on  a  sufficient  number  of  patients  (not  especially 
meeting the criteria for the primary efficacy population) required for an appropriate PK dose finding. 
3.4.   Unfavourable effects 
Given  the  limited  available  data  and  due  to  neonates  representing  the  most  vulnerable  subgroup  of  the 
paediatric population, single AE with an at least reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with risdiplam 
are considered relevant.  
In one subject (1/18, 5.5%) a Grade 3 AE of retinal abnormality (cystoid macular edema) was reported 
(observed  at  SD-OCT,  considered  clinically  significant  and  reported  as  AE).  Although  the  new  cystoid 
macular  edema  started  after  risdiplam  treatment  and  thus  a  possible  causal  relationship  with  treatment 
may  not  be  definitely  excluded,  it  is  acknowledged  that  given  the  resolution  of  the  event  despite  the 
continued risdiplam treatment, retinal immaturity could be a possible alternative explanation. 
As regards to safety results by SMN2 copy number subgroups, when observing the outcome of AEs, it is 
noted that a higher proportion of AEs in patients with ≥4 copies (6/24, 25%) had an “unresolved” outcome, 
in comparison to patients with a lower number of SMN2 copies (2 copies: 1/ 21, 5%; and 3 copies 3/31, 
10%). Also when observing AEs rate adjusted for patient years at risk (that takes into account the different 
time of exposure), the number of AEs per 100 patient-years (90% CI) are higher in the subgroup ≥4 SMN2 
copies [926.64 (638.96, 1303.18)] in comparison to the subgroups with a lower number of SMN2 copies, 
with  non-overlapping  90%  CI  when  compared  to  the  subgroup  with  2  SMN  2  copies  [352.90  (238.91, 
503.92)]. Data are considered too limited to draw definitive conclusions. The MAH has committed to monitor 
in ongoing studies, risdiplam safety by SMN2 copy number subgroups 
Increased liver enzymes as laboratory findings occurred frequently (≤ 2x ULN bilirubin and ALT; ≤3 x ULN 
AST), and in particular AST elevation was sustained, with values not returned to within normal values at 
last visit. In most patients (2/2 bilirubin increase and 4/7 ALT and AST increase) increases started at week 
2  (Day  14  or  15).  The  MAH  has  committed  to  monitor  laboratory  findings  of  hepatic  enzyme  increased/ 
hepatic AEs in this very young patient population (<2 months) in ongoing studies and post-marketing in 
upcoming PSURs. 
3.5.   Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The study duration prevents knowledge on types C, and D possible AEs, as well as type E, since no patient 
was followed after sudden discontinuation in a stable risdiplam treated patient. 
Neonates represent the most vulnerable subgroup of the paediatric population and limited safety data are 
available in this subpopulation with pre-symptomatic SMA (n=18 at the CCOD of the interim analysis), with

no patient  below 20  days of age receiving the dose 0.2 mg/kg (one 16-days neonate received an initial 
dose of 0.04 mg/kg), and only one patient of 20 days of age received the dose 0.2 mg/ kg. The absence of 
PK data or a PK model able to capture the ontogeny of the FMO3 enzyme questions the appropriateness of 
the proposed dosage for neonates below 20 days of age (0.15 mg/kg). However, the limited post marketing 
exposure in countries where the dose of 0.15 mg/kg was approved in children aged 0-20 days of life has 
not triggered safety signals and seems consistent with the approved treatment 2 months and above. This 
is considered reassuring enough for accepting the indication as proposed by the MAH. Nevertheless, safety 
in patients <1 month of age has been included as missing information in the RMP due to the extremely 
limited evidence available in this patient population; due to the need to further strengthen the confidence 
on the optimal recommended dose in this very young population and on the absence of risks associated 
with higher exposure to risdiplam, given the lack of PK data in infants below 20 days of age. Further, the 
MAH  proposed  to  include  the  PK  study  BN44619  (PUPFISH)  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity 
(category 3 PASS) in the RMP and has committed to provide regular updates in upcoming PSURs on the 
progress  of  the  PK  study  BN44619  (PUPFISH).    Additionally,  the  MAH  has  committed  to  conduct  a  real-
world data collection in newborn infants with SMA younger than 2 months who have initiated treatment 
with risdiplam in the US (Study ML44811) to support the benefit risk in this subpopulation. 
the  same  amount  of  sodium  benzoate.  According 
Evrysdi contains 0.375 mg of sodium benzoate per mL. The procedure of first authorization ended up in a 
post  authorization  measure  (PAM)  since  the  data  on  the  adequacy  of  the  proposed  amount  of  sodium 
benzoate  in  the  formulation  were  uncertain.  However,  in  the  proposed  line  extension  the  formulation 
maintains 
relevant  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/396951/2006), the concentration of antimicrobial preservatives used should be at the 
lowest feasible level. Sodium benzoate is of particular concern in pre-term and full-term neonates where 
immaturity  of  metabolic  enzymes  until  8  weeks  of  age,  may  result  in  an  accumulation  of  benzoic  acid 
(please  refer  to  EMA/CHMP/508189/2013).  From  the  totality  of  available  data  and  all  the  previous 
discussions,  it’s  agreed  that  the  inclusion  of  an  antimicrobial  preservative  cannot  be  avoided,  but  since 
doubts  remain  on  the  selected    amount  of  sodium  benzoate  the  MAH  has  yet  to  demonstrate  that  the 
current  concentration  is  the  lowest  effective  level.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  this  should  be 
discussed as part of a separate Scientific Advice procedure. The PAM remains confirmed for the formulation.

3.6.   Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.   Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
As already discussed at the time of the Marketing Authorization (please refer to risdiplam EPAR) - it may 
be acknowledged that the overall findings of previous risdiplam studies and the literature support the early 
initiation of treatment with risdiplam. The remaining uncertainties of such extrapolation of the data from 
symptomatic  patients  to  pre-  or  pauci-symptomatic  patients  that  have  not  yet  reached  the  criteria  for 
clinical diagnosis are also expected to be clarified by the data generated in the agreed PAES (see Annex 
II). 
For this reason, it was agreed that the primary focus of the submitted interim analysis of the RAINBOWFISH 
study, is not efficacy but PK evaluation, in order to support dose determination for patients below 2 months 
of age. However, there were uncertainties in the previously selected dose, in relation to the discrepancy 
between the target AUC value of 2000 ng • h/mL (approved as cap in the PIP) and the observed higher 
median AUC value of 2500 ng • h/mL. together with the variability observed in the limited PK/PD available 
data in pre-symptomatic neonates and young infants < 2 months of age. A lower daily dose was proposed, 
which possibly mitigates the risk of the identified higher than target AUC values in the very young. 
The preliminary efficacy results provided for some of the secondary endpoints in this interim analysis of the 
RAINBOWFISH Study in the 4 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies with a 12 months follow-up, seem to support 
the early initiation of treatment with risdiplam. The MAH has justified the difficulty in enrolment and the 
closure of the study due to not solvable recruitment issues; the ongoing population is expected to provide 
some responses to uncertainties which depend upon longer follow-ups.   
Available data in neonates and young infants <2 months of age do not provide enough reassurance on the 
absence of a clinically relevant unfavourable effect of the higher-than-expected median AUC observed in 
the interim analysis of the RAINBOWFISH study. Nevertheless, the new proposed lower dose (0.15mg/kg) 
for  infants  <2  months  is  considered  reassuring,  and  it  can  be  accepted  that  there  are  no  major  safety 
concerns for infants aged at birth and above, treated with the lower dose of 0.15mg/kg.

3.6.2.   Balance of benefits and risks 
At present, the PK modelling together with the clinical PK data provided support the proposed dosage in 
children  at  least  20  days  old  (0.15  mg/kg).  However,  the  absence  of  PK  data  or  a  PK  model  able  to 
capture the ontogeny  of  the  FMO3  enzyme  questions the  appropriateness  of  the  proposed  dosage  for 
neonates below 20 days of age (0.15 mg/kg). Notwithstanding, limited available post marketing exposure 
in countries where the dose of 0.15 mg/kg was approved in children aged 0-20 days of life has not triggered 
safety signals. 
The interim CSR included efficacy data on secondary endpoints. Although limited, results on asymptomatic 
subjects  with  2  SMN2  copies  support  the  early  initiation  of  treatment  with  risdiplam.The  safety  data  is 
limited in particular for neonates below 20 days of age. The absence of safety signals  on this subpopulation 
treated with 0.15mg/kg in countries where risdiplam is indicated from birth is reassuring. The uncertainty 
remains and thus, “safety in patients <1 month of age” as missing information in the RMP. The MAH has 
committed to include PK study BN44619 (PUPFISH) in the RMP (cat.3 PASS) to address this safety concern. 
The MAH also committed to conduct a real-world data collection (Study ML44811) in newborn infants with 
SMA younger than 2 months.  
All above considered, it is agreed to remove from section 4.1 of the SmPC the limitation of the indication 
starting from 2 months of age and the MAH proposal to recommend <2 months of age a 0.15 mg/kg dose 
is agreed. 
3.7.   Conclusions 
At present available data from the interim analysis of the RAINBOWFISH study in the sought extension of 
indication below 2 months of age, can be accepted, from birth. The benefit-risk is considered to be positive 
in the sought indication.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In  accordance  with  Article  13(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  the  Agency  makes  available  a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial marketing 
authorisation  (MA)  and  is  continuously  updated  during  the  lifecycle  of  the  medicinal  product.  In 
particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the assessment report of 
the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to the authorisation, after 
deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential information, 
please  provide  the  EMA  Procedure  Assistant  your  proposal  for  deletion  of  commercially 
confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 04 August 2023. 
The  principles  to  be  applied  for  the  deletion  of  CCI  are  published  on  the  EMA  website  at 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-medicines-
agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf  
In  addition,  should  you  consider  that  the  CHMP  assessment  report  contains  personal  data,  please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by 04 August 2023. We would like to remind you that, according to Article 
4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal data’ means 
any  information,  relating  to  an  identified  or  identifiable  natural  person  (the  ‘data  subject’).  An 
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference 
to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one 
or  more  factors  specific  to  the  physical,  physiological,  genetic,  mental,  economic,  cultural  or  social 
identity of that natural person. 
It  is  important  to  clarify  that  pseudonymised  data  are  also  considered  personal  data.  According  to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal  data  can  no  longer  be  attributed  to  a  specific  data  subject  without  the  use  of  additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data which 
may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for instance: 
office  e-mail  address  or  phone  number  of  a  company,  data  concerning  health,  e.g.  information  in 
medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable individual.”

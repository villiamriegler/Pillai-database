2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant proliferation of plasma cells and accounts for 10% 15% of all 
haematologic malignancies and 20% of deaths related to cancers of the blood and bone marrow. Multiple 
myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease and accounts for 1% of all cancers and around 10% of all haematological 
malignancies. The incidence in Europe is 4.5–6.0/100 000/year; the mortality is 4.1/100 000/year (ESMO 
guidelines 2013). MM is also slightly more frequent in men than in women (approximately 1.4:1). MM is a 
disease of older adults. The median age at diagnosis is 66 years; only 10 and 2 per cent of patients are younger 
than 50 and 40 years, respectively (Kyle et al., 2003; Bladé et al., 1998). 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell proliferation that occurs within a spectrum of diseases that 
includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, primary amyloidosis, non-secretory myeloma, 
and solitary plasmacytoma (IMWG, BJH, 2003).  
According to clinical guidelines, treatment should be initiated in all patients with active myeloma fulfilling the 
CRAB criteria, (hypercalcaemia >11.0 mg/dl), creatinine >2.0 mg/ml, anaemia (Hb <10 g/dl), active bone 
lesions), and in those symptomatic due to the underlying disease. 
Therapies for myeloma currently consist of the following 6 main classes of agents: proteasome inhibitors 
(bortezomib), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), corticosteroids, alkylators, 
anthracyclines, nitrosoureas (to a lesser extent), plus high-dose chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for those who are eligible.  
About the product 
Farydak is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs at nanomolar 
concentrations. HDACs catalyse the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones and some 
non-histone proteins. Inhibition of HDAC activity results in increased acetylation of histone proteins, an 
epigenetic alteration that results in a relaxing of chromatin, leading to transcriptional activation. In vitro, 
panobinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and other proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest 
and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Increased levels of acetylated histones were observed in xenografts 
from mice that were treated with panobinostat. Panobinostat shows more cytotoxicity towards tumour cells 
compared to normal cells (SmPC, section 5.1; see Non-clinical aspects).

The sponsor applied for the following indication: Farydak, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
The recommended indication for approval is: Farydak, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have 
received at least two prior regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.Treatment with 
Farydak should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies (see SmPC, section 
4.2). 
The recommended starting dose of panobinostat is 20 mg, taken orally once a day, on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 
12 of a 21-day cycle. Patients should be treated initially for eight cycles. It is recommended that patients with 
clinical benefit continue the treatment for eight additional cycles. The total duration of treatment is up to 
16 cycles (48 weeks). 
Panobinostat is administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. 
The bortezomib and dexamethasone prescribing information should be consulted prior to the start of the 
combination treatment to assess whether a dose reduction is required. 
The recommended dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 given as an injection. The recommended dose of 
dexamethasone is 20 mg taken orally on a full stomach.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of panobinostat is 
(2E)-N-hydroxy-3-[4-({[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino}methyl)phenyl]prop-2-enamide 
2-hydroxypropanoate (1:1) and it has the following structure and properties: 
Assessment report

Page 11/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Molecular formula: C21H23N3O2   -   Relative molecular mass: 439.51 gmol-1 
The structure of panobinostat was inferred from the route of synthesis and confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRPD. 
The active substance is a white to slightly yellow or brownish, slightly hygroscopic, light sensitive crystalline 
powder, slightly soluble in water and ethanol but insoluble in acetonitrile and n-octanol. Since it is slightly basic, 
panobinostat is more soluble at the lower pH found in the stomach. The active substance is de-lumped and 
sieved to ensure content uniformity in the finished product and rapid dissolution in vivo. 
Panobinostat free base is achiral although the lactate counter-ion contains a single chiral centre. Racemic lactic 
acid is used resulting in a racemic active substance. The olefin is produced in the E configuration. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for panobinostat, although a solvated and a hydrated form are known, the 
latter having been used in early clinical studies. The proposed anhydrous form is thermodynamically stable 
relative to the other two and is formed by the commercial manufacturing process. 
Panobinostat is considered to be a new active substance. It is neither an active metabolite, nor a pro-drug of any 
other active substance authorised within a medicinal product in the EU. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Panobinostat is synthesized convergently in five main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. Two manufacturers are responsible for production of intermediates and 
the third for synthesizing the active substance. The olefin geometry is controlled by the process and the minor 
Z isomer is limited both in an intermediate and the active substance specifications. The starting materials were 
re-defined during the procedure in order to address a major objection raised by CHMP. As a result, the 
originally-proposed starting materials are now classed as intermediates, new starting materials have been 
defined, and new manufacturers responsible for the additional manufacturing steps have been added. The route 
of synthesis of these intermediates remains the same although additional steps will now be carried out under 
GMP. The applicant has committed to provide data demonstrating equivalence of the intermediates made under 
GMP to those manufactured previously, as well as a revised QP declaration and certificates of analysis of the new 
starting materials by September 2015. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis and the critical elements of the process required 
to ensure the quality of panobinostat have been discussed in detail. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual impurities 
were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. A genotoxic impurity is present in one of the 
re-defined starting materials which is currently controlled as a regular impurity. Given its structure and the 
opportunity for depletion in the intervening synthetic steps (it hydrolyses rapidly in the presence of water), it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 12/124 
 
  
  
highly unlikely to be present in the active substance which is itself genotoxic. Nonetheless, the applicant has 
committed to develop an analytical method specific to this impurity and provide the details to CHMP by 
September 2015, including data to demonstrate its depletion. 
The active substance is packaged in PE bag stored inside a sealed laminated foil bag. The packaging materials 
comply with the EC Directive 2002/72/EC and EC Regulation 10/2011. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC), genotoxic impurity (IC), residual solvents (GC), water content (coulometric oven method), loss on 
drying (TGA), heavy metals (ICP-MS), sulphated ash (micro method), microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur., skip 
testing), lactate assay (potentiometric titration), particle size (laser diffraction) and colour and clarity of solution 
(Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. One genotoxic impurity is controlled below the 
TTC level in the active substance specification.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on twenty four pilot and commercial scale batches of the active substance used for 
toxicology, clinical and stability studies are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in 
a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25 oC / 60% RH), for up to 24 months under intermediate conditions (30 oC / 75% RH), and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 oC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In 
addition, data was provided for the same three batches stored under refrigerated conditions (5 oC) for up to 12 
months. The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity (XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
genotoxic impurity (IC), loss on drying (TGA), and colour and clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.). The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant trends were observed in any batches under any of the conditions tested. These batches were 
manufactured before the starting materials were re-defined. However, they were made using exactly the same 
process, albeit with two steps carried out outside of GMP. The applicant has committed to present comparability 
data between intermediates manufactured both under and outside of GMP by September 2015. Additional 
stability studies are considered unnecessary. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 13/124 
  
  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch which was also used for 
forced degradation work. Stressed conditions included aqueous solutions in the presence (or absence) of acid, 
base and oxidant and at elevated temperatures and solid state studies at high temperature and humidity, 
exposed to oxygen. The active substance is slightly sensitive to light and degrades significantly in aqueous 
solution under all conditions, being susceptible to oxidation and hydrolysis. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable when protected from light and moisture. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of development was to identify an immediate release solid oral dosage form of panobinostat. Early 
clinical studies used hard capsules manufactured using a hydrate form of the active substance, made via simple 
dry blending. Issues with the flow properties and content uniformity of the bulk powder indicated that an 
alternative formulation was required, in order to supply larger scale trials and eventually, the commercial 
market. A switch was made to the anhydrous form of panobinostat and the bulk blend was manufactured by a 
more scalable wet granulation process. Despite the slight hygroscopicity of the active substance, it was shown 
to be stable to hydration and to changes in polymorphic form in the presence of water. The two formulations 
have the same quantitative composition, other than a slight increase in lubricant content, compensated for by 
a reduction in filler weight in the latter.  The same bulk powder blend is used for the manufacture of each tablet 
strength, only the amount encapsulated and the capsule size being different. The redeveloped formulation 
solved the content uniformity issues. Compatibility of panobinostat with the excipients was demonstrated by a 
series of stability studies on binary mixtures. 
In order to develop a suitable manufacturing process, a qualitative risk analysis was undertaken to identify 
factors likely to impact the performance of the product based on previous knowledge of panobinostat properties 
and of wet granulation and encapsulation processes in general. Parameters identified for further investigation 
were granulation water amount, granulation time, final blending revolutions, and encapsulation speed. These 
factors were investigated using a design of experiments (DoE) approach on full scale batches of the 15 and 20 
mg strengths. It was found that a combination of high water content and long granulation time resulted in 
denser granules which dissolve more slowly. Based on these results, five full scale batches of the 10 mg strength 
were manufactured varying the various parameters within the tighter limits shown by the DoE to afford finished 
product of suitable quality and with an acceptable dissolution profile. 
No formal design space is claimed by the applicant despite the multi-variate experiments carried out. The 
claimed proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and set-points are considered acceptable. 
The formulation used during the later clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated by comparison of profiles of batches 
manufactured with the critical process parameters (CPPs) set just outside the PARs. The dissolution profiles of 
the two clinical formulations were compared and despite differences at neutral pH (although the end-point is the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 14/124 
  
  
same), the high solubility of the active substance in acidic media means complete dissolution in the stomach is 
expected, especially under the prescribed fasting conditions. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PCTFE/alu blisters. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of seven main steps: blending of part of the intra-granular excipients with 
panobinostat and wet granulation; drying and milling; blending with the remaining portions of intra-granular 
excipients and further wet granulation; drying and milling; blending with extra-granular excipients; 
encapsulation; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The wet granulation steps are key to ensuring adequate content uniformity of the blend. PARs for added water 
and granulation time were set in order to achieve the desired granule size and density. Since water content can 
adversely affect capsule filling, an in-process control (IPC) for LOD following granulation and drying is included 
and PARs for number of blending revolutions and encapsulation speed are defined. In practice, the defined 
ranges are rather tight, cover likely variability in the process, and are justified by multi-variate experiments. 
IPCs are also included for appearance, weight, length and disintegration time of the bulk capsules. Stability data 
supports a bulk holding time for the hard capsules stored inside LDPE bags in sealed metal containers of up to 
12 months. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three commercial scale batches of each 
strength, manufactured at the intended set-points. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance, identification (UV, HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), water content (KF), assay 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur., skip-testing). 
One impurity, also a metabolite of the active substance, has been qualified at the appropriate level and is 
controlled in the finished product specification. Another specified impurity is controlled below the qualification 
threshold. The same genotoxic impurity as is limited in the active substance specification is also controlled in the 
finished product specification according to the TTC approach. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for six commercial scale batches of the 10 and 20 mg strengths and three 
batches of the 15 mg strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data was provided on three commercial scale batches of the 10 and 20 mg strengths of finished product 
only. This bracketing approach is acceptable since these strengths represent the extremes and the capsules are 
quantitatively proportionate in terms of composition and manufactured from a common blend. The batches of 
finished product were identical to those proposed for marketing and samples were stored in two packaging 
formats for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 ºC 
/ 75% RH), according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. One packaging format (PVC/PCTFE/alu blister packs) 
represents the intended commercial pack whilst the other (PVC/PVDC blister packs) was the originally proposed 
pack. Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, water content, impurities and assay. No out of 
specification results were observed under either condition. A slight increase in one specified impurity and an 
increase in water content were observed after 24 months under long term conditions whereas under 
intermediate conditions, a slight increase in two specified impurities, an increase in water content, and a 
decrease in assay were observed. The PVC/PCTFE/alu packaging material affords better moisture protection and 
was thus selected for the commercial product. Stability data was generated under accelerated conditions (40 ºC 
/ 75% RH) using batches packed only in PVC/PVDC blisters. Although this is not the packaging proposed for 
marketing, the approach is considered acceptable since it represents a “worst case scenario” with the 
commercial packaging offering better protection.  
One batch each of the 10 and 20 mg strengths was also tested under the following conditions: 5 ºC / ambient 
RH; -20 ºC / ambient RH; 50 ºC / ambient RH; freeze/thaw cycles between -20 ºC and 25 ºC / ambient RH. 
Results showed no significant trends other than a reduction in water content at 50 ºC. This study allowed 
assessment of acceptable transport conditions. 
One batch each of the 10 and 20 mg strengths was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant trends were observed indicating that 
the product stored in the intended packaging is not photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life (3 years) and storage conditions (do not store above 30 oC) as 
stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of the gelatine 
used in the manufacture is provided. 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing 
process. However, no formal design space is claimed for the manufacturing process. The defined PARs are 
considered acceptable.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should provide the representative certificates of analysis for one batch of each of the starting 
materials issued by the recipient of the batches by July 2015. 
2.  The applicant should submit the comparability data for batches of intermediates made under GMP following 
re-definition of the starting materials with batches of those intermediates previously classed as starting 
materials no later than September 2015. 
3.  The applicant should provide the revised QP declarations no later than September 2015. 
4.  The applicant should develop an analytical method specifically to control the genotoxic impurity present in 
one starting material and submit the method and results confirming its depletion in the relevant 
intermediate by September 2015. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal toxicity studies were performed in compliance with GLP with exception of some of the safety 
pharmacology studies, which were conducted prior to the implementation of ICH S7A/B guidelines.  
The applicant did not seek scientific advice on non-clinical issues at the CHMP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The inhibitory effect of panobinostat (NVP-LBH589) on the HDAC enzymes was evaluated and compared to 
other HDAC inhibitors in several assays (Study RD-2008-51291). By using immunopurified HDAC enzymes 
(isoforms 1-11) and an artificial substrate it was shown that panobinostat potently inhibits both class I and class 
II HDACs (Table 4). Furthermore it was shown that panobinostat exposure could enhance P21 expression levels 
both at protein level and using p21 promoter-Luc reporter gen into H1299 human lung carcinoma cells (Table 3).

Table 3. In vitro activity profile of NVP-LBH589 in comparison with other histone deacetylase 
inhibitors 
Panobinostat was shown to inhibit cell proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines representing different tumour 
types with IC50 in low nanomolar range) and induced cell death in these cancer cell lines (LD50 nanomolar, 
LD90 submicromolar range). Compared to cancer cells, normal cell lines appeared less sensitive to panobinostat 
and required much higher concentrations of NVP-LBH589 to inhibit their proliferation or the induction of 
apoptosis (Table 4, Figure 1).

The effect of panobinostat on a panel of cell lines (n=472, representing 36 tumour types) was tested in study 
RD-2013-50424. Panobinostat was found to exhibit potent in vitro activity against most cell lines. Figure 2 lists 
the distributions of different cancer types among the remaining cell lines.

Multiple myeloma cell lines (n=14) were among the four most sensitive tumour types to panobinostat in this 
assessment. Only Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and non-Hodgkin’s T-cell Lymphoma

were slightly more sensitive (Figure 3). In this experiment, the drug concentration at the “inflection point” is 
analogous to the IC50.

Panobinostat was found to be a potent antimyeloma agent (IC50 < 40 nmol/L) on 2 MM cell lines (MM1, U266) 
and fresh cells from multiple myeloma patients (n=4), including cells resistant to conventional 
chemotherapeutic agents (Maiso et al., 2006). Only minor toxicity was seen to normal lymphocytes present in 
the same patient sample (Figure 4). In addition, panobinostat potentiated the action of drugs, such as 
bortezomib, dexamethasone, or melphalan, but not of doxorubicin, revlimid, arsenic trioxide or azacytidine.

The  in  vivo  antimyeloma  activity  as  single  agent  was  investigated  in  two  murine  xenograft  models;  one  of 
subcutaneous plasmacytoma (CB17-SCID mice s.c. implanted with 3x106 MM1S cells in matrigel) and one of 
disseminated MM1S cells (i.v. injection of 2x106 luciferase expressing MM1S cells) (Ocio et al. 2010). 
In the s.c plastocytoma model, treatment with panobinostat (10mg/kg i.p. 5 days weekly for 21 days, and 5 
mg/kg on the same schedule on subsequent days) significantly decreased the growth of the plasmacytoma, and 
the inhibition of tumour growth correlated with an improvement in time to endpoint (TTE: tumour diameter ≥2 
cm or moribundity) from median of 30 days to 70 days in animals treated with the vehicle and Panobinostat, 
respectively (Figure 5). Similar results were obtained in a disseminated luciferase model.

Effect of single-agent panobinostat on tumour growth (A,C) and survival (B,D) in plasmacytoma model (A,B) and

Panobinostat was evaluated in combination with standard of care therapeutic agents for multiple myeloma to 
capture potential synergies for safe combination treatments in the clinic. Double and triple combination of 
Panobinostat with bortezomib and/or dexamethasone was assessed in the subcutaneous human plasmacytoma 
model. Suboptimal doses of bortezomib (0.1mg/kg i.p., 5 days weekly), dexamethasone (1mg/kg i.p., 5 days

weekly, were used in order to assess possible synergistic effects. The dose of Panobinostat was originally used 
at 10mg/kg i.p., 5 days weekly but decreased to 5mg/kg after 21 days of treatment, due to the high anti-tumour 
activity. It was found that Panobinostat significantly potentiated the effects of bortezomib and dexamethasone 
and the triple combination demonstrated significantly greater effects than either double combination (P<0.05) 
(Figure 6). 
Figure 6. Effect of single-agent, double and triple combination of panobinistat (P) bortezomib (B) 
and/or dexamethasone (D) on tumour growth (A) and survival (B) in plasmacytoma model 
Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to assess changes in markers of apoptosis and proliferation. 
Tumours from mice treated with the triple combination PBD showed a decrease in expression of the proliferation 
marker Ki67, as well as increased expression of apoptotic markers cleaved caspase 3 and PARP. 
The correlation between dose of Panobinostat and histone acetylation in tumour lysates from treated 
tumour-bearing animals was investigated in Study RD-2010-50113. To assess whether compound exposure 
correlated with a pharmacodynamic response, histone acetylation was monitored in tumour tissue harvested 
from subcutaneous HCT116 tumours over a 72 hour time course following a single dose of Panobinostat. After 
a single dose of Panobinostat at 19.8 mg/kg, tumours were excised at various time points (1, 3, 8, 16, 24, 48, 
and 72 hr; n = 3) for PD and PK analysis. Panobinostat treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histone H4 
in HCT116 tumour lysates. Maximal acetylation occurred at approximately 8 hours following treatment and 
trended towards baseline at 72 hours. Similar kinetics was observed for acetylation of histone H3 (Figure 7).

In a separate experiment, HCT116 tumour-bearing animals were treated with Panobinostat for 5 consecutive 
days. Panobinostat was dosed at 11.9 mg/kg, iv, qd for 5 days. After dosing on days 1 and 3, tumour and plasma 
samples were collected at 0.5, 4, 8, and 24 hours for PD and PK analysis. Following a final dose on day 5, 
samples were collected up to 96 hours following treatment. Panobinostat dosed at 11.9 mg/kg, iv, qd for 5 days 
resulted in an approximate 10-20-fold maximum increase in acetylated histone H4 in HCT116 tumour tissue. 
When tumours were analyzed after dosing on days 1, 3, or 5, there was a similar trend in pharmacodynamic 
response, with peak response occurring 4-8 hours following treatment. Following a final dose on day 5, 
acetylation of histone H4 trended to levels of vehicle control animals by 96 hours following treatment (Figure 8).

The in vivo anti-tumour activity of Panobinostat against the HCT116 human colon xenograft model with an intact 
p53-p21 pathway was evaluated in study RD-2001-50288. The initial dosing schema which was tested included 
increasing doses of panobinostat administered i.v., 5 times per week for three weeks in HCT116 colon tumours 
in athymic mice. Dose dependent anti-tumour activity was observed, with 40mg/kg resulting in tumour 
regression, and was tolerated with less than 15% body weight loss during the treatment period. There was one 
death in the 40 mg/kg dose group in a repeat study which was deemed unrelated to treatment (data not shown). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
As bone disease is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM), the effect of panobinostat on 
bone damage was explored.  The anti-tumour and bone-anabolic activity of panobinostat as a single agent or in 
combination with bortezomib was assessed in the (luciferized) MM1.S xenongraft model (Study 
RD-2008-51313). Treatments were initiated on day 11 following tumour cell implantation (2 × 106 luciferase 
labeled MM1.S cells, iv). Animals were treated for 4 weeks; panobinostat was administered at 10, 15 or 20 
mg/kg i.p. 5 times weekly, bortezomib at 0.2 mg/kg/week or 1 mg/kg twice/week ip. A dose-related reduction 
in tumour burden was seen in all treatment groups. The combination of panobinostat (10 mg/kg dose) with 
bortezomib (0.2 mg/kg dose) did not result in enhanced anti-tumour activity as compared to either single agent. 
MicroCT was used to evaluate the effects on trabecular bone. An effect on trabecular parameters (increased 
bone density, trabecular density, number and thickness, normalisation of trabecular spacing) was observed 
following treatment with panobinostat, the higher dose of bortezomib (1 mg/kg), or the combination of 
panobinostat at 10 mg/kg and bortezomib at 1 mg/kg twice weekly as compared to vehicle treated control. 
Again, no difference was observed in combination relative to single agent therapy (data not shown).   
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted with panobinostat to assess the effects of panobinostat on vital 
organ systems. Studies included CNS evaluation in mice, an assessment of the respiratory system in rats, 
cardiovascular telemetry studies in dogs, in vitro electrophysiological and HERG trafficking studies. 
Potential effect on CNS was evaluated in Study 0280108 using male mice as test model. Animals were observed 
up to 24 hr post dosing following iv dosing. The 30 mg/kg was the lowest dose in this study. At this non-lethal 
dose there were no effects on behaviour in mice. At higher doses (60 and 100 mg/kg) decreased motor activity, 
wobbly gait, convulsions and death (1/10 at 60 mg/kg and 5/10 at 100 mg/kg) was observed up to1 hr post 
dose. In the highest dose decreased grip strength and body temperature were seen at 1 hr post dosing. 
There were no effects of panobinostat on respiratory function in male rats (Study 0280118) through the highest 
doses tested (10 mg/kg, i.v.) (Last time point was 6hr following dosing). 
Assessment report

Panobinostat was assessed in two hERG channel patch-clamp assays (Studies 0280136 and 0870294) and the 
estimated IC50 values were approximately 5.8 µM and 3.5 µM at 33 to 35°C (Hill coefficient = 1.2). One of 75 
human metabolites of panobinostat, 519-07 (also known as BJB432 or M37.8), had an estimated IC50 value of 
1.6 µM (Hill coefficient = 1). Under identical conditions, the positive control (60 nM terfenadine) inhibited hERG 
potassium current by 83.1 ± 2.8% (Study 0870294). When tested in the Langendorff perfused rabbit heart 
model, concentrations at and above 1 µM panobinostat resulted in delayed repolarization, induced triangulation, 
decreased coronary perfusion, increased pacemaker activity and favoured the development of ventricular 
tachycardia which degenerated into fibrillation (Studies RD-2001-50377 and 0350418). Panobinostat did not 
show any risk of QT prolongation and related arrhythmias after 150 minutes of exposure at 0.5 µM (Studies 
0618524 and 0618523). When assessed in the same model, BJB432 delayed repolarization process at ≥ 1 µM, 
caused instability (3 µM), early after depolarization (10 µM), and induced triangulation and Torsade de pointes 
(30 µM) (Study 0618585). In an intravenous safety pharmacology screening study in dogs conducted at 1 and 
3 mg/kg prolongation of the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) was seen at both doses from 6 to 20 hours 
post-dose (Study 0110024). The study was repeated using lower doses (0.06, 0.2, and 0.6 mg/kg) and very 
slight treatment-related increases QTc interval were seen at doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg (Study 0210083). To support 
the current three times weekly clinical oral dosing regimen (Days 1, 3 and 5) a repeated oral dose telemetry 
study in Dogs/Beagle was conducted at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Based on the results, no related changes or 
cumulative effects in the hemodynamic or electrocardiographic parameters were observed with the exception of 
QTc prolongation, where prolongation in QTc upwards of 25 msecs was noted in within some animals over the 
monitoring period (Study 0680202). Panobinostat was combined with (non-effective doses of) docetaxel (1 µM, 
study 0616811), trastuzumab (1µM, study; 0616812), 5-azacytidine (1 µM; study 0616812), and a partially 
active dose of nirlotinib (0.3 µM, study 0516281). It was found that docetaxel and not trastuzumab or 
5-azacytidine increased potency of panobinostat to inhibit hEG current. Co-administration of panobinostat and 
nirlotinib increased hERG inhibitory potency. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted with panobinostat (see discussion on 
non-clinical aspects).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
All in vivo studies using radiolabeled panobinostat were conducted with 14C-labeled drug substance. The 
14C-labeled material with uniform labelling located on the indole ring ([14C6]panobinostat) was used in the in 
vitro blood distribution and plasma and serum protein binding study, in vitro plasma stability study, in vitro 
across-species liver slice study, and an in vivo rat i.v. study.  
The radioactivity concentrations in plasma, blood, and feces homogenate were determined by dissolution of the 
samples with a commercially available tissue solubilizer, addition of liquid scintillation cocktail, and subsequent 
liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Radioactivity concentrations in the urine were determined directly by the 
addition of scintillation cocktail and LSC. The radioactivity concentrations in organs and tissues were determined 
by quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA). Plasma and in some studies, tissue concentrations, of 
panobinostat were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis in the radiolabeled animal absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies, the radiolabeled human ADME study, and other pharmacokinetic 
(PK) studies in, rat, dog, and tumour bearing mice.

Panobinostat was moderately bound to plasma proteins and binding was independent of concentration over the 
0.1 to 100 µg/mL test range in the mouse, rat, dog, and human. Binding was independent of temperature over 
a 4 to 37°C range. The bound fraction in dogs averaged 0.787 ± 0.037 (37°C) and 0.805 ± 0.085 (4°C). The 
bound fraction was 0.828 ± 0.022 (4°C) in the mouse, 0.889 ± 0.015 (4°C), in the rat and 0.896 ± 0.028 (37°C) 
in human.

A modest species difference in panobinostat blood-to plasma concentration ratios was observed. The highest 
ratio, 2.2 ± 0.45, was observed in dogs, the average ratios in the other species were: 1.7 ± 0.12 (mouse), 1.5 
± 0.11 (rat), and 1.4 ± 0.12 (human). 
The distribution of radioactivity into the tissues of pregnant rats following an oral dose of 100 mg/kg of [14C] 
panobinostat was evaluated on gestational day 12 and 17. On gestational days 12 and 17 the highest 
radioactivity concentrations in the fetus were seen at 3 hours post dose. On gestational day 12 the fetal levels 
at 3 hours were ~ 3-fold maternal blood levels. By 24 hours post dose the fetal levels were ~ 1/3 of the maternal 
blood values. On gestational day 17, the fetal tissue levels were consistently below those in the maternal blood. 
The plasma levels of panobinostat and its metabolites in rat, rabbit, dog and human are displayed in Table 8.

Following an oral dose of panobinostat in humans, radioactivity excretion is both renal and fecal, with a small 
preference for fecal elimination. Excretion in rabbits and dogs also involved both renal and fecal routes following 
oral or intravenous dosing, with a preference for fecal elimination. In the rat following an oral dose elimination 
was almost solely in the feces. Following an intravenous dose in the rat, fecal elimination was predominant with 
renal excretion being minor. In bile duct cannulated rats dosed intravenously excretion was principally in bile 
(~62%) followed by urinary excretion (~30%), about 10% was eliminated in the feces within 72 h.

Toxicokinetic data 
The AUC0-24h values obtained in Study 0570309 designed to investigate the effects of panopbinostat when 
administered by oral gavage, on the reproduction and fertility of rats of the F0 generation and on the early in 
utero development of the F1 generation are summarised in Table 13.

Local Tolerance  
The potential irritation and local tolerance of panobinostat after single intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous 
injections were investigated in New Zealand White rabbits. The concentration of panobinostat solution injected 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 38/124 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
was 0.78 mg/mL freebase in vehicle. The control site received the control item, 7.206 mg DL lactic acid, 34.46 
mg mannitol, 200 mg propylene glycol, sodium hydroxide q.s. to pH4 and water for injection q.s. with 5% 
dextrose in water. The outcome of the study was that a single injection of panobinostat was well tolerated by 
venous, arterial or perivenous administration. There were no toxicologically significant changes after 
intravenous injection. Erythema, that was reversible within 96 h of injection, was noted following intra-arterial 
injection. Perivenous injection was associated with slight to well-defined erythema that was accompanied by 
mild inflammation 48 h after injection. There were no in-life or microscopic findings present 14 days after 
injection, indicating reversibility. 
Other toxicity studies 
Two studies (one in vitro and one in vivo) were conducted in order to investigate thyroid effects in rats observed 
in repeat-dose toxicity studies. The purpose of the in vivo study was to investigate the mechanism of thyroid 
effects observed in the repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs. The duration of the in vivo study was one month 
and the dose given was 75 mg/kg three times a week by oral gavage. Propylthiouracil (PTU) was used as a 
positive control. Oral administration of the positive control thyroid toxicant propylthiouracil (PTU) to male rats 
for 5, 12, or 26 days produced time dependent changes in thyroid hormones (increases in TSH, decreases in T3 
and T4) and organ weight increases with correlative microscopic changes in the thyroid (follicular cell 
hypertrophy) and pituitary (pars distalis hypertrophy). Oral administration of panobinastat produced minimal 
and often transient changes in thyroid hormone levels (increases in TSH, decreases in T3 and T4), which were 
not accompanied by organ weight or microscopic changes in the thyroid, pituitary or liver. Histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) activity was reduced in the thyroid, pituitary and liver of panobinastat treated animals on day 5, and in 
the liver on days 12 and 26. 
In two mouse local lymph node assays (LLNA) (studies 0670352 and 0670584) covering a range of externally 
applied concentrations (0.1 to 10%), panobinostat showed contact allergen, irritant and sensitizing potential.  
An assessment (study 0517503) of the Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/Vis) absorption spectrum for panobinostat lactate 
salt indicated light absorption within the range of natural sunlight. The phototoxic potential of panobinostat was 
evaluated in the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity assay (study 0580320) performed with Balb/c 3T3 clone 31. The EC50 
values for panobinostat were 1.3 µg/mL (-UV) and 1.0 µg/mL (+UV). The resulting Photo Irritation Factor was 
1.3 and the calculated Mean Photo Effect was 0.027.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Panobinostat is a HDAC inhibitor, inhibiting all HDAC proteins of HDAC families I, II and IV in nanomolar range 
in vitro. In cellular assays it was shown that panobinostat enhances histone acetylation and affects processes 
known to be regulated by histone acetylation status (gene expression of p21, TPRM, Hep27, thymidine kinase).  
Inhibition of tumour cell proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro was observed, with leukeamic cell 
lines, including multiple myeloma cell lines, among the most sensitive cells. Also inhibition of proliferation of 
patient MM tumour samples was seen.  The effect on histone acetylation was confirmed in vivo in tumour tissue 
harvested from subcutaneous HCT116 (colon) xenograft tumours. Anti-tumour activity of single agent 
panobinostat was shown in several models including two multiple myeloma xenograft models (one with localised 
tumour formation, the other disseminated tumour burden). This was accompanied by increased survival. The

anti-tumourigenic potential of panobinostat is increased when combined with either agent, and most prominent 
in the triple therapy (panobinostat, bortezomib and dexamethasone).  
Studies on potential effects on CNS and respiratory function are rather limited; however no cause for concern 
has been identified. Potential cardiovascular effects have been investigated in more depth;  it can be concluded 
that panobinostat has the potential to prolong QTc interval (see SmPC section 4.4 and RMP).  
No specific PD drug interaction studies have been provided apart from the combination studies with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone in the primary pharmacodynamics which was acceptable. As QTc prolongation occurs with 
panobinostat concomitant administration of medicinal products that are known to cause QTc prolongation 
should be used with caution (see SmPC section 4.5 and RMP).  This potential risk has been classified as an 
important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Mostly pharmacologically mediated effects were observed in the toxicity studies, including effects on the 
haematological system and correlating immunosuppression, effects on cell proliferation in GI tract and effects 
on different glands which are impaired in secretion function upon treatment with panobinostat, effecting among 
others testis / epididymis / salivary gland / thyroid gland.  
The primary target organs of toxicity following administration of panobinostat in rats and dogs were identified as 
the erythropoietic, myelopoietic and lymphatic systems. The thyroid changes including hormones in dogs 
(decrease triodothyronine (T3)) and rats (decrease in triodothyronine (T3), tetraiodothyronine (T4) (males) and 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) were observed at exposures corresponding to 0.07-2.2 of the human AUC 
observed clinically (see SmPC section 5.3). 
An increase in early resorptions was observed in female rats (doses ≥30 mg/kg). Prostatic atrophy accompanied 
by reduced secretory granules, testicular degeneration, oligospermia and increased epididymal debris were 
observed in dogs at exposures corresponding to 0.41-0.69 of the human clinical AUC and not fully reversible 
after a 4 week recovery period. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with panobinostat. Panobinostat has demonstrated mutagenic 
potential in the Ames assay, endo reduplication effects in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, and DNA 
damage in an in vivo COMET study in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, that are attributed to the pharmacological 
mode of action (see SmPC section 5.3).  
Due to its cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of action, panobinostat can influence the quality of sperm formed during 
treatment.  Sexually active men taking panobinostat and their female partners should use a highly effective 
method of contraception during the man’s treatment and for six months after his last dose of panobinostat (see 
SmPC section 5.3). Reduced fertility in males has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
Based on animal data, the likelihood of panobinostat increasing the risk of foetal death and developmental 
skeletal abnormalities is predicted to be high. Developmental toxicity has been classified as a potential risk in 
the Risk Management Plan. Embryo foetal lethality and increases in skeletal anomalies (extra sternabrae, extra 
ribs, increases in minor skeletal variations, delayed ossification and variations of the sternabrae) were seen 
above exposures corresponding to 0.25 of the human clinical AUC (see SmPC section 5.3). When panobinostat 
is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as 
well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy of hormonal contraceptives needs to be 
considered (see Risk Management Plan). Women of child bearing potential taking panobinostat in combination 
with bortezomib and dexamethasone must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment and 
Assessment report

Page 41/124 
  
  
for three months after the last dose of panobinostat. Women using hormonal contraceptives should additionally 
use a barrier method of contraception (see SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
The effects of panobinostat on labour and post-natal growth and maturation were not evaluated in animal 
studies (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Given panobinostat’s cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of action, the potential risk to the foetus is high. Farydak should 
only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks to the foetus. If it is used 
during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while using it, the patient must be informed of the potential 
risk to the foetus (see SmPC section 4.6 and Risk Management Plan). 
It is unknown whether panobinostat is excreted in human milk. Given its cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of action, 
breastfeeding is contraindicated during Farydak treatment (see section 4.6). 
The Applicant has submitted an Environmental Risk Assessment in accordance with the Guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). All calculated PEC/PNEC quotients were well below 1 and it is concluded that the 
use of panobinostat constitutes no risk for the environment, including microbial communities in sewage 
treatment plants, surface waters, groundwater, sediments and terrestrial compartments. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information has been

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 14 clinical studies were submitted characterizing the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat monotherapy. 
Across study analyses have been performed: population PK analysis, exposure- thrombocytopenia relationships 
and PK-QTc relationships. Additionally, in vitro studies with human biomaterials were performed in order to 
assess the potential of panobinostat to act either as a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of drug metabolizing 
enzymes and drug transporters.  
Absorption  
Panobinostat is rapidly and almost completely absorbed with Tmax reached within 2 hours of oral administration 
in patients with advanced cancer. The absolute oral bioavailability of panobinostat was approximately 21%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 43/124 
 
 
  
  
After oral administration, panobinostat pharmacokinetics appears to be linear in the dose range 10-30 mg, but 
AUC increases less than proportionally with dose at higher doses (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Table 18: Absolute bioavailability of panobinostat estimated from data from 2 studies with iv 
dosing and 8 studies with oral dosing 
*Adjusted geometric mean AUCinf/dose i.v. (n=69) from two i.v. studies: 22.699 CSF: clinical service form; FMI: final market 
image; GMR: geometric mean ratio 
Overall panobinostat exposure and inter-patient variability remained unchanged with or without food, whereas 
Cmax was reduced by <45% and Tmax prolonged by 1 to 2.5 hours with food (i.e. both normal and high-fat 
breakfasts). Since food did not alter overall bioavailability (AUC), panobinostat can be administered regardless 
of food in cancer patients (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Table 19: Study 2111-Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters by treatment 
Distribution 
Panobinostat is moderately (approximately 90%) bound to human plasma proteins. Its fraction in the 
erythrocyte is 0.60 in vitro, independent of the concentration. The volume of distribution of panobinostat at 
steady state (Vss) is approximately 1,000 litres based on final parameter estimates in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis (see SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Panobinostat is extensively metabolised, and a large fraction of the dose is metabolised before reaching the 
systemic circulation. Pertinent metabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of panobinostat are 
reduction, hydrolysis, oxidation and glucuronidation processes. Oxidative metabolism of panobinostat played a 
less prominent role, with approximately 40% of the dose eliminated by this pathway. Cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) is the main oxidation enzyme, with potential minor involvement of CYP2D6 and 2C19 (see SmPC 
section 5.2). 
The biotransformation of panobinostat is presented in Figure 9.

Panobinostat represented 6 to 9% of the drug related exposure in plasma. The parent substance is deemed to 
be responsible for the overall pharmacological activity of panobinostat (see SmPC section 5.2). 
After a single oral dose of [14C] panobinostat, 29 to 51% of administered radioactivity is excreted in the urine 
and 44 to 77% in the faeces. Unchanged panobinostat accounted for <2.5% of the dose in urine and <3.5% of 
the dose in faeces. The remainders are metabolites. Apparent panobinostat renal clearance (CLR/F) was found 
to range from 2.4 to 5.5 l/h. Panobinostat has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 37 hours based 
on final parameters estimate in the population PK analysis (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
For the investigation of the oral multiple dose proportionality, pooled information (Studies B1101, B2101 and 
B2102) was used, presented in Table 20. 
Table 20: Summary of panobinostat PK parameters following multiple p.o. dose, selected 
schedules, by actual dose 
Over the dose range of 10 to 30 mg, Cmax and AUC0-48h increased less than dose proportionally with a slope of 
0.74 (90%CI 0.20-1.28) for Cmax and 0.62 (90%CI 0.20-1.04) for AUC0-48h. 
Time dependency 
Data from 3 studies (Studies B1101, B2101 and B2102) was incorporated of oral multiple dose panobinostat 
administration. Pharmacokinetics of panobinostat at day 15 was compared to day 1. Rate of accumulation was 
calculated as the ratios of AUC0-48h on day 15 to day 1 AUC0-48h (Table 21).

Special populations 
In the phase III clinical study 162 out of 387 patients were aged 65 years or over. Plasma exposure of 
panobinostat in patients aged 65 years or younger was similar to those older than 65 years in the pooling of 
single agent panobinostat studies between the dose range of 10 mg and 80 mg (see SmPC, section 5.2). 
Panobinostat was not evaluated in multiple myeloma patients under 18 years of age (see SmPC, section 5.2). 
There is no relevant use of panobinostat in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years in the indication 
multiple myeloma (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
The PK and safety of oral panobinostat in patients with advanced solid tumours and various degrees of renal 
function was evaluated in a phase I, open-label, multicenter study (LBH589X2105). A total of 37 patients were 
enrolled in the study, which included 11 patients with normal renal function, 10 patients with mild renal 
impairment, 10 patients with moderate renal impairment, and 6 patients with severe renal impairment. In the 
core phase of the study, patients received a single dose of oral 30 mg panobinostat. Serial blood samples for 
assessing the PK of panobinostat were obtained at pre-dose and over 96 hours post-dose for all patients in each 
group. The extension phase was designed to assess the safety of panobinostat following multiple oral doses of 
the drug in cancer patients with renal impairment. The safety findings suggest that various degrees of renal 
impairment did not impact adversely the safety profile of panobinostat in advanced cancer patients. The rates 
of grade ≥  3 adverse events and serious adverse events in cancer patients with renal impairment were within 
the range of the rates in patients with normal renal function. 
Mild, moderate and severe renal impairment based on baseline urinary creatinine clearance did not increase the 
panobinostat plasma exposure in mild, moderate and severe groups (see SmPC, section 5.2).  
The PK and safety of oral panobinostat in patients with advanced solid tumours and various degrees of hepatic 
function was evaluated in a phase I, open-label, multicenter study (LBH589X2101). A total of 25 patients were 
enrolled in the study, 10 patients with normal hepatic function, 8 patients with mild hepatic dysfunction, 6 
patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction, and 1 patient with severe hepatic dysfunction. The study consisted 
of a core Phase of seven days with a single dose of 30 mg panobinostat followed by an extension Phase of 28-day 
treatment cycles of 30 mg oral panobinostat three times a week every week. Last patient last visit in the study 
was on 30-Nov-2012. 
Mild and moderate hepatic impairment as per NCI CTEP classification increased panobinostat plasma exposure 
by 43% and 105%, respectively. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see SmPC, section 5.2).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Panobinostat oxidative metabolic enzyme identifications were investigated in vitro using pooled human liver 
microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 isozymes or CYP (study R0101764). To identify the P450 
enzymes involved in the metabolism of [14C] panobinostat in humans, [14C] panobinostat (39 μM) was 
incubated with the recombinant human P450 enzymes: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 (Arg144,Ile359), CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP4A11 and in 
human liver microsomes using specific substrates and inhibitors were included. CYP3A4 was found to be the 
main enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of panobinostat (70-98%) with possible minor contributions 
by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (3.5- and 13-fold lower than the CYP3A4 contribution, respectively).  
Panobinostat is a competitive CYP2D6 inhibitor in vitro with a Ki value of 0.17 µM (study R0201469) and a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and shown to be panobinostat concentration dependent (Ki value of 12.0 
µM and Kinact value of 0.0228 min-1) in vitro in study R0700973. 
Risk assessment of the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A by panobinostat was investigated based on a 
steady-state mathematical algorithm and modelling using Simcyp (study R0800469-01). The time-based 
Simcyp model simulated panobinostat exposures that would cover the actual clinical exposures from doses of up 
to 80 mg. Simcyp predicted a median 1.18-fold change in AUC of midazolam using the more predictive 
time-based simulation model. Although generally over-predictive, the steady-state Simcyp model predicted less 
than a 2-fold change in midazolam AUC (1.76-fold).  
In vitro permeability and transporter interaction of [14C] panobinostat was assessed across Caco-2 cell 
monolayers (study R0500488). The bidirectional transport experiments (apical-to-basolateral and 
basolateral-to-apical) were performed using a number of [14C] panobinostat concentrations (5-131 µM) and 
Caco-2 cells transfected with transport protein inhibitors of Pgp and MRP. Panobinostat showed a high efflux 
ratio across Caco-2 monolayers, which was reduced to unity in the presence of Pgp inhibitor but not in presence 
of MRP-2 inhibitor indicating that panobinostat is a good substrate for Pgp. 
In study 0500600-01, the potential of panobinostat (0-100 μM) to inhibit P-glycoprotein was evaluated using 
rhodamine as Pgp substrate in MDA435 T0.3 cells. At the examined concentrations (up to a nominal 
concentration of 100 μM), panobinostat was not found to inhibit Pgp-mediated efflux of Rho123 in MDA435 T0.3 
cells. 
Panobinostat had no appreciable effect on the efflux activity of BCRP up to a concentration of 25 µM (study 
R1300018).  
Based on the in vitro inhibition results of study R1200558, panobinostat was found to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 
with an IC50 of 51.0 μM and of OATP1B3 with an IC50 of 94.1 μM. Based on the in vitro inhibition results of study 
R1200559, panobinostat was found not to be an inhibitor of OAT1 up to the highest concentration investigated 
(400 μM). Panobinostat was found to be an inhibitor of OAT3 with an IC50 of 21.7 μM and a maximal inhibition 
of 39%. Based on the in vitro inhibition results of study R1200560, panobinostat was found to be an inhibitor of 
OCT1 with an IC50 of 4.4 μM and of OCT2 with an IC50 of 60.0 μM.  
Study R0500725 was an evaluation of panobinostat as an inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes and drug 
transporters in human hepatocytes after 72 hours of treatment. Panobinostat (0.01- 1 µM), was determined not 
to be an in vitro inducer of CYP1A1/2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9/19, or CYP3A mRNA or activity in primary human 
hepatocytes. In addition, panobinostat was not an inducer of UGT1A1, ABCB1 (P-gp) or ABCC2 (MRP2) mRNAs.

In vivo 
Study B2109 was conducted in order to investigate the effect of oral panobinostat on dextromethorphan, a 
CYP2D6 substrate, and to assess the efficacy and safety of oral panobinostat in patients with advanced solid 
tumours who were intermediate, extensive or ultra extensive metabolisers for CYP2D6. In the core phase of the 
study, panobinostat 20 mg was administered once per day on days 3, 5, and 8. Oral dextromethorphan at 60 mg 
was administered on the mornings of Day 1 and Day 8.  There was a high inter-subject variability in 
dextromethorphan pharmacokinetics even though only extensive CYP2D6 subjects were selected. 
Dextromethorphan Cmax and AUC was increased by a mean of 1.83 (90% CI 1.44-2.34) and 1.64 (1.13-2.06) 
fold upon co-administration with panobinostat when compared with dextromethorphan administered alone in 
extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers.  
Study B2110 was a phase 1B study to investigate the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of oral 
panobinostat. Twenty mg panobinostat was administered to 14 patients with solid tumours on day 1 and 8, and 
ketoconazole 400 mg OD was given on days 5-9. Co-administration with ketoconazole increased panobinostat 
exposure. Geometric mean ratio for Cmax was 1.6 (90% CI 1.2-2.2) and AUC 1.8 (1.5-2.2), whereas Tmax and 
half-life essentially remained unchanged. 
In study B2207 the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat were assessed in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone. In the dose expansion phase, dexamethasone was administered intermittently in combination 
with bortezomib and panobinostat (i.e. dexamethasone 20 mg was administered from cycle 2 on D1, D2, D4, 
D5, D8, D9, D11 and D12 during a 21-day cycle). An approximate 20% reduction on panobinostat exposure in 
combination with bortezomib was observed when dexamethasone was added to the treatment regimen than 
those from cycle 1 day 8, potentially as a result of CYP450 3A4 induction by dexamethasone. Bortezomib 
exposure was not affected by combination with dexamethasone. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
The pharmacokinetics studies using human biomaterials were described in section ‘‘Pharmacokinetic interaction 
studies’’. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A semi-mechanistic indirect PK-PD model was used to describe the population platelet dynamics with effects 
resulting from panobinostat concentrations of an effect compartment following the treatment of single-agent 
panobinostat in 441 patients. Individual panobinostat concentrations were simulated based on the PK 
parameter estimates obtained from a prior population PK model. Model analysis showed a dose and schedule 
dependent relationship between panobinostat exposure and thrombocytopenia (TCP). The thrice weekly oral 
dosing schedule prevents excessive accumulation of drug and reduces occurrence of TCP, with an every other 
week dosing schedule predicted to facilitate platelet recovery in patients with lower platelet function at baseline. 
In addition, the risk of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia is also determined by individual patient’s baseline platelet 
count. 
A linear mixed-effect model was used to describe time matched (within 60 minutes) plasma panobinostat 
concentration and QTc interval measurement corrected for heart rate in 499 patients treated with panobinostat 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 49/124 
  
  
oral regimens across 12 studies with oral doses between 10 and 80 mg. Variables including baseline QTc 
intervals, panobinostat plasma concentrations, route of administration, and dosing schedule were included in 
the final model. Maximum QTcF prolongation was observed on Day 5 after initiation of single-agent 
panobinostat treatment. In the range of clinically relevant concentrations with 20 mg oral administration thrice 
weekly, no apparent relationship between QTcF and plasma concentration was observed. In addition, no 
apparent relationship between QTcF and metabolite BJB432 plasma concentration was observed. With 
intermittent dosing (TIW), the incidence of grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 ms), continues to be 
uncommon at (about 1% overall) with the highest frequency of <5% seen in patients treated with the 60 mg 
oral dose in the TIW QW dosing schedule. Grade 4 QTc prolongation or torsade de pointes has not been reported 
in clinical trials with these oral intermittent schedules (data not shown). 
The data above refers to panobinostat monotherapy, not to combination therapy with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone. For the combination of panobinostat, bortezomib and dexamethasone, reports of the clinical 
effect of QT prolongation and other ECG abnormalities are discussed in the safety section. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients only; this is acceptable due to possible genotoxicity; 
healthy volunteer studies were deemed unethical. 
Two different oral formulations of panobinostat (FMI and CSF) have been used in the clinical studies.  No 
bioequivalence study has been conducted to compare the two formulations (FMI and CSF). In the PPK analysis, 
a slower absorption rate was estimated for the FMI formulation compared to the CSF formulation resulting in an 
estimated 30% lower Cmax but with no effect on the total exposure. However, in view of the total 
pharmacokinetic study package, the impact on the knowledge of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
panobinostat is expected to be minimal. The CSF formulation has been used only in the studies B1101, B2108, 
B2101 and B2102. Sufficient PK data are available for the FMI (the formulation to be marketed) which has been 
used in the pivotal study. No bioequivalence study is required to characterise the PK of the two formulations.  
Panobinostat is a DAC inhibitor with in vitro activity against all class I, II and IV DACs and is reported to act 
through histone acetylation but also through non-histone proteins. Synergistic effects with BTZ and Dex have 
been shown in in vitro and in vivo models. The main MOA in MM is stated to be related to the clearance of 
misfolded para-proteins which are essential for MM cell survival. 
The food effect has been properly investigated. The recommended intake of panobinostat in the pivotal phase 3 
study B2308 is regardless of food intake. The difference in Cmax under fasted and fed conditions might introduce 
pharmacokinetic variability. 
Overall panobinostat exposure and inter patient variability remained 
unchanged with or without food, whereas Cmax was reduced by <45% and Tmax prolonged by 1 to 2.5 hours 
with food (i.e. both normal and high fat breakfasts). Since food did not alter overall bioavailability (AUC), 
panobinostat can be administered regardless of food in cancer patients 
Plasma protein binding was found to be consistent throughout the in vitro and in vivo (ex vivo) studies. No 
displacement interactions are to be expected. There was a trend for lower protein binding in patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment. 
The metabolism of panobinostat is extensive and diverse. The reduction of the hydroxamic acid moiety to the 
amide metabolite is likely catalysed by cytosolic or mitochondrial liver enzymes such as aldehyde oxidases, the 
metabolism of panobinostat to the carboxylic acid due to hydrolytic activity in blood plasma, formation of the 
direct glucuronide metabolite was found to be catalysed by several UGT enzymes and the one- and two-carbon 
shortening of the hydroxamic acid containing side chain is proposed to be mitochondrial. CYP enzyme mediated

metabolism is mainly by CYP3A4 and with minor contributions by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes. Based on the 
effect of ketoconazole (1.8-fold increase in AUC), it was estimated that CYP3A4 contributed for 40% to the 
metabolic clearance. Therefore, medicinal products that can influence CYP3A4 enzyme activity may alter the 
pharmacokinetics of panobinostat. Panobinostat is a P gp substrate. Characterization and measured presence of 
the metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces are sufficient as the metabolites do not demonstrate activity to any 
of the HDAC isoforms.  
Panobinostat showed less than proportional increase in exposure observed at higher doses, which may in part 
be related to solubility limitations. No unexpected accumulation of panobinostat was observed following multiple 
dosing. 
Inter- and intra-subject variability was lower following IV administration compared to oral administration 
indicating that absorption and first-pass metabolism significant contribute to the variability. Inter-subject 
variability of clearance was also high 65% in popPK and was largely unexplained.  No dose dependent absorption 
component seems to be used for the popPK, while across study comparison shows less than proportional 
pharmacokinetics following oral administration of panobinostat. 
For patients >75 years of age, depending on the patient’s general condition and concomitant diseases, an 
adjustment of the starting doses or schedule of the components of the combination regimen may be considered. 
Panobinostat may be started at a dose of 15 mg, and if tolerated in the first cycle escalated to 20 mg in the 
second cycle. Bortezomib may be started at 1.3 mg/m2 once weekly on days 1 and 8, and dexamethasone at 20 
mg on days 1 and 8 (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
Special populations have been investigated by dedicated renal and hepatic impairment studies.  
Plasma exposure of panobinostat is not altered in cancer patients with mild to severe renal impairment. 
Therefore, starting dose adjustments are not necessary. Panobinostat has not been studied in patients with end 
stage renal disease (ESRD) or patients on dialysis. Use in patients with renal impairment has been adequately 
reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2 and 5.2) and in the Risk Management Plan. 
A clinical study in cancer patients with impaired hepatic function showed that plasma exposure of panobinostat 
increased by 43% (1.4 fold) and 105% (2 fold) in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
respectively. Patients with mild hepatic impairment should be started on panobinostat at a reduced dose of 15 
mg during the first treatment cycle. A dose escalation from 15 mg to 20 mg may be considered based on patient 
tolerability. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started on panobinostat at a reduced dose of 
10 mg during the first treatment cycle. A dose escalation from 10 mg to 15 mg may be considered based on 
patient tolerability. Frequency of monitoring of these patients should be increased during treatment with 
panobinostat, particularly during the dose escalation phase. Panobinostat should not be administered in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment due to lack of experience and safety data in this population. Adjustment of 
bortezomib dose should also be considered (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
In patients with hepatic impairment receiving concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors, treatment with panobinostat should be avoided due to lack of experience and safety data in this 
patient population (see SmPC, section 4.2).  
In vitro studies to investigate the potential of pharmacokinetic drug interaction were in general well conducted 
in accordance with the Guideline on Investigation of Drug Interactions. However, since the in vitro study to 
assess the involvement of OATPs had technical drawbacks (too high concentrations, lack of validation of test 
system)  the CHMP recommended the applicant to investigate in vitro the possible involvement of OATP1B1 and 
1B3 uptake transport. Clinically relevant panobinostat concentrations should be used. A transfected cell system 
Assessment report

is preferred, but if hepatocytes are used, the system should be fully validated verifying the function of 
transporters and inhibitors. 
The panobinostat fraction metabolised through CYP3A4 is approximately 40%. In clinical studies in multiple 
myeloma, the exposure of panobinostat was decreased by approximately 20% by the concomitant use of 
dexamethasone, which is a dose dependent mild/moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Strong inducers are expected to 
have greater effects, and may reduce the efficacy of panobinostat, therefore the concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin 
and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), should be avoided (see SmPC section 4.5).  
It is currently unknown whether panobinostat may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. In 
addition, when panobinostat is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy of 
contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using hormonal contraceptives should additionally use a barrier 
method of contraception (see SmPC section 4.5). Interaction with strong CYP3A inducers has been classified as 
a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Co-administration of a single 20 mg panobinostat dose with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased 
the Cmax and AUC of panobinostat by 1.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared to when panobinostat was given 
alone. In patients who take concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A and/or Pgp inhibitors, 
including, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
posaconazole and nefazodone, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced (see SmPC section 4.5).  
Patients should be instructed to avoid star fruit, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, pomegranates and pomegranate 
juice, as these are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A enzymes and may increase the bioavailability of 
panobinostat (see SmPC section 4.5). 
In patients who take concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A and/or Pgp inhibitors, including, 
but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, posaconazole 
and nefazodone, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced (see section 4.2). 
In vitro signals for enzyme inhibition was seen for CYP3A4 (TDI) and CYP2D6 (direct inhibition). Panobinostat 
increased the Cmax and the AUC of dextromethorphan (a substrate of CYP2D6) by 1.8  and 1.6 fold, 
respectively, and it cannot be excluded that the effect may be larger on a more sensitive CYP2D6 substrate. 
Avoid panobinostat use in patients who are taking CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (including 
but not limited to pimozide). When Farydak is co administered with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. 
atomoxetine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, and pimozide) dose titrate individual 
CYP2D6 substrates based on tolerability and frequently monitor patients for adverse reactions (see SmPC 
section 4.5). Interaction with CYP2D6 substrates has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
The potential in vivo relevance of the in vitro time dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 was addressed using PBPK 
modelling in Simcyp. Further model validation was performed in the second round of assessment, and it was 
concluded that the risk for panobinostat to affect CYP3A4 substrates via time-dependent inhibition was low. 
Available in vitro data was however not possible to use to exclude a risk for induction of CYP3A4 in the 
gastrointestinal tract, due to the low concentrations used in the in vitro experiments. The risk for moderate or 
strong induction was deemed unlikely based on the lack of obvious time-dependent pharmacokinetics of 
panobinostat itself (weak CYP3A4 substrate). Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors has been classified as a 
potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 52/124 
  
  
No data is available that can be used to exclude the risk that panobinostat could be a weak inducer of the 
enzyme CYP3A4 in the gastrointestinal tract. This could potentially lead to slightly decreased exposure to 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (see SmPC section 4.5). Interaction with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates has been 
classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Exposure-QTc prolongation and exposure- thrombocytopenia have been evaluated based on panobinostat 
monotherapy. Potential worsening of the effect by the combination therapy has not been evaluated by means of 
exposure-effect relationships. Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 ms) was observed at higher doses than the 
20 mg. In the range of clinically relevant concentrations with 20 mg panobinostat oral administration thrice 
weekly (peak plasma concentration ~20 ng/ml), no apparent relationship between QTcF and plasma 
concentration of panobinostat or BJB432 was observed.  However, there are several subjects with QTc changes 
more than 60 ms at low panobinostat plasma concentrations.  This might also be related to electrolyte 
abnormalities (see safety part of AR). For the combination of panobinostat, bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
reports of the clinical effect of QT prolongation, defined as >500 ms, changes of >60 ms from baseline and other 
ECG abnormalities are discussed in the safety section. 
Concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, 
disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other substances that are known to prolong the QT 
interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin, 
bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a known risk of QT 
prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron and tropisetron should be used with caution (see 
SmPC section 4.5). Interaction with drugs that may prolong the QT interval has been classified as a potential 
risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Panobinostat should be combined with dexamethasone and bortezomib, and limited data suggest that 
dexamethasone may decrease panobinostat exposure (at least 20%) compared to single panobinostat use. No 
sign of pharmacokinetic interactions with bortezomib has been observed, but no formal interaction study was 
performed. In general, the interaction potential of panobinostat should have been evaluated in the intended 
combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib, to evaluate the net interaction potential of all three drugs. In 
addition, concomitant use of the weak enzyme inducer dexamethasone could potentially mask or decrease an 
enzyme inhibitory effect of panobinostat. In this case, however, as the interaction potential of panobinostat 
appears to be low and the potential for PK interactions between the three agents seems low, the approach used 
investigating the interaction potential of panobinostat as a single agent is acceptable. 
Regarding popPK-thrombocytopenia modelling, the used dose regimen of 2 weeks on/ 1 week off and 
combination therapy was not simulated and as dexamethasone decreases the exposure of panobinostat, this 
population PKPD modelling of platelet count is less representative for the combination therapy. However since 
the risk of thrombocytopenia is well recognized, no optimisation of the PKPD model is required. 
The popPK-thrombocytopenia model did not simulate the dosing schedule of 2 weeks on/1 week off in 
combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone but it can be anticipated from the simulations that platelets 
will not be fully recovered within the 1 week off schedule. Risk of thrombocytopenia and recommendations for 
frequent monitoring of blood count have been addressed adequately in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of panobinostat have been adequately 
investigated.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study CLBH589B2207 (B2207) 
Study B2207 was a phase Ib, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of oral panobinostat and iv 
bortezomib in adult patients with multiple myeloma. The primary objective of the study was to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PAN in combination with BTZ.  Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as an 
AE or abnormal laboratory value assessed as clinically relevant and occurring ≤ 21 days following the first dose 
of study treatment in Cycle 1.  
A total of 62 patients were enrolled, including 47 patients in the dose escalation phase and 15 patients in the 
dose-expansion phase.  The majority of patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase discontinued treatment 
(43/47 patients, 91.5%). The primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment were AEs (38.3%) and 
disease progression (36.2%); in the MTD cohort (including a combined 17 patients from cohorts 3 and 6), 
47.1% of discontinuations were due to AEs and 29.4% due to disease progression. At the time of the data 
cut-off, 4 patients from the dose escalation phase of the study were still ongoing; 2 patients each in the MTD 
(PAN 20 mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2) and PAN 25 mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2 cohorts.  
The dose levels for PAN, BTZ and DEX in Study B2207 are presented in Table 22..

BTZ: bortezomib, Dex: dexamethasone, MTD: maximum tolerable dose, PAN: panobinostat 
1 Dex was optional in the dose escalation phase for patients with suboptimal responses but was not considered to be an 
investigational or a control drug. 
2 Administered three times a week (TIW)  
3 Administered iv on Days 1, 4, 8, 11 of a 21-Day cycle. 
4 Treatment was 2-weeks on and 1-week off. 
5 Dex was mandatory in the expansion phase starting at Cycle 2.  
The following DLTs were reported in different dose levels during dose escalation phase:  
• In the PAN 30 mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2 (Cohort 4), DLTs were reported in 4 out of 6 evaluable patients. These 
included thrombocytopenia (2 patients), weakness (2 patients), anorexia, asthenia and fatigue (all in 1 patient). 
This led to de-escalation in PAN dose from 30 mg to 25 mg in next cohort (Cohort 5), keeping the BTZ dose at 
1.3mg/m2.  
• In the PAN 25 mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2 (Cohort 5), DLTs were observed in 2 out of 6 evaluable patients, including 
tumour lysis syndrome (1 patient) and thrombocytopenia (1 patient). This led to de-escalation in PAN dose from 
Assessment report

Page 54/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
25 mg to 20 mg in next cohort (Cohort 6) keeping the BTZ dose at 1.3mg/m2 bringing it back to the dose tested 
in Cohort 3.  
• In the PAN 20 mg + 1.3 mg/m2 (Cohort 6), DLTs were observed in 3 out of 15 evaluable patients (6 patients 
in cohort 3 and 9 patients in cohort 6) and included thrombocytopenia, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension (1 
patient each). 
The observed overall response rate (≥ PR) was 44.7%. The response rate was highest in the following dose 
cohorts: PAN 20 mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2 (52.9%, the MTD), PAN 25 mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2 (55.6%), and PAN 30 
mg + BTZ 1.3 mg/m2 (57.1%). The best overall response in the dose escalation phase included high quality 
responses of sCR and CR in 2 patients each and VGPR in 3 patients. In addition, 14 patients showed PR, 4 
patients showed minor response and 8 patients presented with stable disease (SD) as their best overall 
response. The best overall response was unknown in 9 patients as they had no response category confirmed as 
per the response criteria. 
In the MTD cohort (n=17) of patients, responses were observed in the majority of patients (52.9%). Best overall 
responses included high quality response of sCR in 1 patient, CR and VGPR in 2 patients each. In addition, 4 
patients showed PR, 3 patients showed minor response and 2 patients showed SD. The best response was 
unknown in 3 patients, because there were no confirmed responses for these patients as per the response 
criteria. 
Based on the data from on all patients in the dose escalation phase and the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model, 
the MTD was declared at 20 mg PAN TIW and 1.3 mg/m2 BTZ iv (cohorts III and VI). Dose limiting toxicities were 
reported in 3/15 patients (20%) in the MTD cohort. Thrombocytopenia as a DLT (grade 4) was reported by 1 of 
15 patients (6.7%) in the MTD cohort compared to more than 15% in the cohorts with higher doses of PAN.   
Dose expansion phase  
Following MTD determination of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and safety data review, a protocol 
amendment was introduced prior to initiation of the dose-expansion phase. The purpose of the second, 
dose-expansion phase was to confirm safety and determine preliminary efficacy of the dose identified in the 
dose escalation phase.   
In the dose expansion phase of Study B2207, a total of 15 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM 
were enrolled. In the expansion phase, patients received the MTD of panobinostat (20 mg) plus bortezomib (1.3 
mg/m2); however, panobinostat was administered using a non-continuous dosing schedule, similar to that for 
bortezomib (first 2 of 3 weeks), to manage thrombocytopenia and to allow for accelerated platelet recovery (Lin 
et al., 2009).  Additionally, dexamethasone was administered to all patients because preclinical data (Ocio et al., 
2010), showed that the triple combination of panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone yielded 
synergistically greater antimyeloma activity than any dual combination, and clinical data showed clinical benefit 
of dexamethasone when added to bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Twenty milligrams of 
dexamethasone was chosen based on evidence showing that for patients who had worsening 
disease/suboptimal response whilst receiving BTZ alone, the addition of 20 mg of dexamethasone was 
associated with improved responses (Jagannath et al., 2006). Dexamethasone administered “upfront” showed 
to be highly efficacious in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (Davies et al., 2007, Corso et al., 2009). 
Administration of dexamethasone was started in Cycle 2 to allow for analysis of panobinostat and bortezomib 
pharmacokinetics in the absence (Cycle 1) and presence (Cycle 2) of the drug. 
The majority of patients in the expansion phase of Study B2207 responded to treatment with PAN + BTZ + DEX. 
Overall, 11/15 patients (73.3%) responded to treatment: 3/15 patients (20.0%) achieved VGPR, 8/15 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 55/124 
  
  
(53.3%) achieved PR and 2 patients (13.3%) showed confirmed minor response. Of the 4 BTZ-refractory 
patients in the expansion phase (FAS), 2 patients presented with PR. 
The majority of patients in the expansion phase discontinued study treatment (11/15 patients, 73.3%). The 
remaining 4 patients were still on study treatment at the time of the data cut-off. 
Throughout the dose expansion phase of the study, the primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment 
were AEs (33.3%) and disease progression (20.0%); the rate of discontinuation due to AEs among patients in 
the dose expansion phase was lower compared to patients receiving the MTD in the dose escalation phase 
(33.3% vs 47.1%, respectively). In the dose expansion phase there were lower incidences of haematological 
AEs, as compared to the MTD cohort of dose escalation phase.

Table 23: Treatment doses and regimens - D2308 study 
Treatment phase 1 (TP1):  In TP1 the duration of a treatment cycle was 21 days given to a total of 8 cycles. 
The first dose of oral panobinostat/placebo in Cycle 1 defined Day 1 of the treatment cycle.  
Treatment phase 2 (TP2): TP2 started with Cycle 9. Only patients who had experienced a No Change (NC) or 
better and presented no toxicities (CTCAE ≥ grade 2) could enter TP2. The duration of a treatment cycle in TP2 
was 42 days. In TP2, a maximum of 4 cycles was administered. The first dose of panobinostat/placebo in Cycle 
9 defined Day 1 of the treatment cycle. 
No cross-over was allowed. 
Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment  
Patients unable to tolerate the minimum dose level of Dex could continue on the rest of their randomly assigned 
regimen without Dex.  
Patients requiring discontinuation of BTZ due to peripheral neuropathy could continue on PAN/Placebo ± Dex. 
BTZ could be restarted at any time during treatment phases 1 and 2 if clinically indicated. Patients requiring 
permanent discontinuation of BTZ due to any other reason or permanent discontinuation of PAN/Placebo were 
to discontinue study treatment and be followed for progressive disease/relapse and survival.  
If a patient required a dose delay of >21 days from the intended day of the next scheduled dose, the patient was 
to be discontinued from study treatment.  
The dose of PAN/PBO could be modified as per the table below during any cycle. Dose levels lower than 10 mg 
TIW in combination with a minimum of 0.7 mg/m2 BTZ, with or without Dex, were not permitted at any time. If 
a dose below 10 mg TIW in combination with the minimum dose of BTZ was required, the patient was to be 
discontinued from study treatment. Continuation of PAN/Placebo dosing without BTZ at any dose was not 
permitted in TP1 or TP2.

Table 24: Dose reductions for panobinostat/placebo- D2308 study 
Patients receiving a reduced dose level of panobinostat/placebo due to toxicity could be considered for dose 
re-escalation if: either the study treatment-related AE had reverted in severity to grade ≤ 1 or baseline level, 
and at least nine scheduled doses at the reduced level had been administered and tolerated. 
Growth factor support for anaemia and neutropenia, if initiated before study entry was allowed. 
Bisphosphonates were permitted only if treatment had begun prior to the start of screening. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study CLBH589D2308 was to compare progression free survival (PFS) in patients 
treated with panobinostat in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone vs. patients treated with placebo in 
combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone. 
The key secondary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) between treatment arms. Other secondary 
objectives included: comparison of overall response rate (ORR) comprising complete response (CR), near CR 
(nCR) and partial response (PR), determination of nCR plus CR rate, determination of minimal response rate 
(MRR), determination of time to response (TTR), determination of time to progression (TTP), assessment of 
duration of response (DOR) from first occurrence of PR or better, assessment of safety of the combination 
therapy, assessment of health-related quality of life (QoL) and symptoms of multiple myeloma, and evaluation 
of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of panobinostat and bortezomib in a subset (at least 20) of Japanese patients.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was PFS based on modified European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
(mEBMT) criteria assessed by the Investigator.  
Disease status categories according to EBMT, Modified EBMT 
NC: no change; SD: stable disease; MR: minor response; PR: partial response; VGPR: very good partial response; CR: 
complete response; nCR: near complete response; sCR: stringent complete response; mCR: molecular complete response. 
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented PD or relapse 
or death due to any cause. If a patient had not progressed or was not known to have died by the date of the 
analysis cut-off or had started another antineoplastic therapy, or had PD/relapse or died after more than two 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 60/124 
  
 
 
  
  
missing adequate assessments, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate response assessment prior 
to the cut-off date or start of new antineoplastic therapy. 
Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. 
If a patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of last contact. 
The overall response rate (ORR) was based on the proportion of patients with CR, nCR or PR per investigator’s 
assessment based on mEBMT criteria. 
Time to response (TTR) was defined as the time between the dates of randomization until first documented 
response (CR, nCR or PR) per investigator’s assessment based on mEBMT criteria.  
Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from the first documented occurrence of response (PR or 
nCR or CR) until the date of the first documented PD or relapse or death due to MM per investigator’s 
assessment based on mEBMT criteria.  
Time to progression or relapse (TTP) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the 
first documented PD or relapse or death due to multiple myeloma per investigator’s assessment based on 
mEBMT criteria.  
HRQoL and multiple myeloma symptoms as measured by: EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-MY20, and 
FACT/GOG-NTX. Time to definitive deterioration in PRO was estimated according to the minimal important 
difference (MID). For EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status scores, a 5-point decrease or more in the score from 
baseline was considered as definitive deterioration (Osoba 1998, Dubois 2006). For EORTC QLQ-MY20 disease 
symptom scales, the MID (Osoba 1998, Dubois 2006) was defined by considering a 5-point increase or more in 
the score as definite deterioration. For FACT/GOG-NTX neurotoxicity subscale, the MID (Dubois 2006) was 
defined as a decrease of 3 points or more in the score which will be considered a definitive deterioration. 
Sample size 
In order to calculate the sample size, median PFS of PBO+ BTZ + DEX and PAN + BTZ + DEX arms were 
assumed to be 7.5 months and 10.2 months, respectively (HR=0.74). This assumption was based on a study 
comparing BTZ with DEX in patients with relapsed myeloma with an observed median TTP of 6.22 months 
(Richardson et al., 2005). Under the above assumption and using a 1:1 randomization to the two arms a total 
of 460 PFS events were required corresponding to an estimated 762 randomized patients. 
Randomisation 
The randomisation procedure pertained that at Visit 2 (Day 1 Cycle 1) all eligible patients were randomized via 
Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response System (IXRS) to one of the two treatment arms. 
A total of 768 eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to the panobinostat and control arms. Central 
randomization was stratified 1) by number of prior lines of anti-myeloma therapy: 1 vs 2 or 3 and 2) by prior use 
of bortezomib: yes vs no. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all randomized patients. All efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS, 
following the intent-to-treat principle. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 61/124 
  
  
The Safety Set comprises all patients who received at least one dose of any component of study treatment. All 
safety analyses were performed on the Safety Set. 
Per Protocol Set (PP Set) comprises all patients from the FAS who had received at least one dose of randomized 
study drug and had no major protocol deviations.  Protocol deviations classified as major led to the exclusion of 
patients from the PP Set. 
Interim analysis 
Per the 3 look group sequential design, two interim analyses were planned after observing 33% and 80% of the 
required final number of 460 PFS events. These analyses allowed stopping for futility at the first interim analysis 
of PFS and for efficacy at the second interim analysis of PFS. 
The second interim analysis, planned to occur after 80% of observed events, was not performed due to the time 
needed to implement amendment 5 to the protocol and the resulting overlap with the timing of the final 
analysis. Accordingly, the Applicant continued the study until the final number of 460 PFS events had accrued. 
There was no change in the group sequential design for the final analyses of PFS and OS; alpha was spent at 
each time point that an interim analysis had been planned.  
Sensitivity analyses 
A stratified log-rank test, the median with 95% CI and HR as derived from a Cox proportional hazards model 
including treatment arm and stratification factors, were repeated with the following alternative conventions 
(Table 25).

Table 25: Sensitivity analyses of PFS- D2308 study 
Supportive analyses 
A multivariate cox model analysis was performed if the primary analysis of PFS was statistically significant. The 
following prognostic factors in the Cox proportional hazards model were included: sex, age (< 65 years/ ≥ 65 
years), race (Caucasian/Asian/Other), renal impairment: yes/no, prior stem cell transplantation: yes/no, 
clinical staging of MM according to ISS (Stage I/Stage II and III), geographic region (Europe/South East 
Asia/Western Pacific/Africa/Americas/ Eastern Mediterranean), prior use of IMiDs (defined as thalidomide or 
lenalidomide): yes/no, prior use of IMiDs and BTZ: yes/no, MM characteristics 
(relapsed/relapsed-and-refractory).

Recruitment 
Between 29 January 2010 and 12 March 2012, 768 patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple 
myeloma were randomized into the trial from 194 centres in 34 countries. 
The first patient was enrolled on 21 January 2010 and the last patient completed the study treatment on 1 March 
2013.  
Conduct of the study 
The study design and planned conduct is presented in Table 26. 
Table 26: The study design and planned conduct - D2308 study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended five times. The key features of each amendment are given below. 
Amendment 1 (issued on 30-Jun-2010): This amendment was a local, country-specific amendment for Japan 
whose main purpose was to include hospitalization of Japanese patients during the first cycle of treatment in 
order to comply with the local BTZ label. Secondly, this amendment included PK sampling on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
Cycle 1 Day 8 in Japanese patients. Thirdly, this amendment added the commercially available dosage form of 
BTZ available in Japan as part of the global protocol. As of the release date of this amendment, 34 patients had 
been randomized worldwide. 
Amendment 2 (issued on 22-Dec-2011): As of 17-Nov-2011, 668 patients had been randomized worldwide. This 
amendment was a global amendment to adjust the sample size to compensate for a higher than expected 
drop-out rate in the absence of any safety concerns. A review of blinded data concluded that the drop-out rate 
was higher than originally assumed. The main reason for the drop-out rate was that patients who discontinued 
treatment withdrew their consent to be followed for response assessment as per protocol. As a consequence, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 65/124 
 
  
  
the expected drop-out rate as written in the statistical section of the original protocol needed to be updated. The 
sample size was therefore recalculated in order to attain the targeted number of PFS events while maintaining 
the original statistical assumptions. In addition to the increased sample size, an operational action plan for new 
and ongoing patients was put into place to follow patients for disease assessment after treatment 
discontinuation. Under the original assumption of obtaining 460 PFS events based on 610 patients and a 
drop-out rate of 10%, the required sample size was 672. Based on review of blinded data, the drop-out rate was 
approximately 20%. As a result, the sample size was increased to 762 patients. 
Amendment 3 (issued on 07-Mar-2012): As of 07-Feb-2012, 742 patients had been randomized worldwide, with 
386 patients having discontinued treatment. This amendment was a global amendment to enhance robustness 
of the second interim analysis (IA2), in order to provide a more precise estimate of the treatment effect and to 
increase the probability of detecting a treatment effect. This amendment increased the PFS event fraction for 
IA2 from 67% to 80% (306 to 368 events). If the study were to be stopped at IA2, the higher fraction of planned 
PFS events would reduce the risk of an overestimation of the treatment effect. The treatment effect assumptions 
(HR 0.74) were unchanged. The power to detect a treatment effect and to stop the study at IA2 for efficacy was 
increased from 53% to 71%. The cumulative type I error was unchanged (less than 5 %, two-sided). 
Based on the recommendation of the Study Steering Committee, an additional secondary objective was added: 
to compare nCR plus CR between treatment arms per mEBMT criteria. 
The protocol was updated with current panobinostat guidance on the use of concomitant medications. 
Amendment 4 (issued on 02-Oct-2012): As of 07-Sep-2012, there were 87 patients remaining on treatment. At 
the time of this amendment, the first interim analysis had been performed. The main aim of this global 
amendment was to clarify that the collection of serum calcium variables (ionized serum calcium and/or total 
serum calcium and serum albumin for the derivation of albumin-adjusted serum calcium) should continue after 
the end of treatment until the end of follow-up for disease evaluations. The collection of calcium data after the 
end of treatment is mandatory in order to identify hypercalcaemia, which is a criterion for progressive disease 
and relapse, both during the treatment phase and during post-treatment disease evaluation. 
Amendment 5 (issued on 06-May-2013): The study completed enrolment in March 2012 with 768 randomized 
patients. Last patient last treatment (LPLT) occurred on 01-March-2013. For efficacy assessments, the study 
protocol required measurement of M-protein spikes by PEP in serum and urine as per mEBMT criteria. 
Accordingly, the objective of this protocol amendment was: to document PEP results without specific 
measurement of the M-protein spike, and to document use of measurement methods other than PEP (e.g. 
nephelometry).

Investigator-based PFS benefit of PAN + BTZ + DEX was consistent across the series of pre-planned analyses in 
clinically relevant subgroups for the patient population including number of prior lines of treatment: one vs two 
or three and prior use of bortezomib: yes vs no. However,(after database lock) the cytogenetic risk factor was 
removed from the multivariate cox model for PFS and OS analyses as the FISH assessment has only been done 
for 244 out of 768 patients who consented for the biomarker companion protocol. Thus efficacy in relation to 
cytogenetic risk factor cannot be evaluated. 
Key secondary endpoint: Overall Survival (OS) 
The first interim analysis of OS was based on 286 (68.9%) OS events: 134 (34.6%) in the panobinostat group 
and 152 (39.9%) in the placebo group. Median OS in the PAN arm was 33.64 months) compared to 30. 39  
months in the PBO arm (HR 0.87; CI:0.69,1.10; p=0.2586) (data not shown). 
The second interim analysis of OS (cut-off date August 2014) was based on 359 (86.5%) OS events: 169 
(43.7%) in the panobinostat group and 190 (49.9%) in the placebo group. Median OS was 38.24 months and 
35.38 months, in the PAN+BTZ+Dex and PBO+BTZ+Dex arms, respectively (HR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.07; 
p=0.18). The results are presented in Table 33 and Figure 11.

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Global health status/QOL scores of the QLQ-C30 initially declined in both treatment arms over the study 
treatment period, before returning back to baseline levels after Week 18 in both the PAN+BTZ+Dex and 
PBO+BTZ+Dex arms, as illustrated in Figure 12.  
Figure 12 : EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/ QoL Score: Change from baseline by treatment 
group (FAS) 
Mean (SD) baseline global health status/QOL scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 for the PAN+BTZ+Dex and 
PBO+BTZ+Dex arms were 60.86 (21.153) and 58.27 (23.250), respectively. 
The decline in mean change from baseline global health status/QOL scores at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 48 
were –9.853, –7.867, and –2.986 in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm, and –4.044, –1.518, and 4.345 in the 
PBO+BTZ+Dex arm, respectively. The difference in the median time to definitive deterioration in global health 
status/QOL between the PAN+BTZ+Dex and the PBO+BTZ+Dex arms was 2 weeks. The median (95% CI) time 
to definitive deterioration was 2.33 months (1.97, 2.79) in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm and 2.83 months (2.76, 
3.02) in the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm, with a HR of 1.26 (1.05, 1.50) in favour of the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm. 
Mean changes from baseline in diarrhoea scores were numerically positive and high (>10 point change) in both 
treatment arms; changes in diarrhoea scores were higher in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm (data not shown).  
Mean baseline disease symptoms scores from the myeloma specific module, EORTC QLQMY20,were 24.90  for 
the PAN+BTZ+Dex and 26.23 for the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm. Mean change from baseline disease symptoms scores 
indicated a trending improvement from baseline in both treatment arms but were not different between 
treatment arms (data not shown). 
The mean baseline neurotoxicity subscales of the FACT/GOG-NTX were 36.11 and 36.05 for the PAN+BTZ+Dex 
and PBO+BTZ+Dex arms respectively. Mean changes from baseline in the neurotoxicity subscale initially 
declined in both treatment arms before recovering to some extent over time, but was not different between 
treatment arms (data not shown).

Supportive studies 
Phase II study DUS71 (Panorama II) 
Study DUS71 was a two stage, single arm, open label multicentre phase II study of oral panobinostat (20 mg) 
in combination with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20 mg) in 55 patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma, who were bortezomib refractory and had received at least two prior lines of 
therapy. Patients had to be exposed to an IMiD (lenalidomide or thalidomide). Refractoriness to bortezomib was 
defined as disease progression on or within 60 days of the last bortezomib containing line of therapy. The 
Assessment report

primary endpoint of the study was to assess overall response rate (ORR) after 8 cycles of therapy as per mEBMT 
criteria (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Patients were heavily pre treated and had received multiple prior regimens (median: 4; range: 2-11). All 55 
patients were previously treated with bortezomib and at least one IMiD (lenaolidomide: 98.2%, thalidomide: 
69.1%). The majority of patients had received prior transplant (63.6%) (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The median duration of exposure to study treatment was 4.6 months (range: 0.1 24.1 months). Patients 
achieved an ORR (≥PR (partial response)) of 34.5% and 52.7% (≥ MR (minimal response)). The median time 
to response was 1.4 months and the median duration of response was 6.0 months. The median OS was 17.5 
months (95% CI 329, 767 days) and the median PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI 107, 204 days) (see SmPC 
section 5.1). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The defined study objectives fit the overall aim of the pivotal study to investigate whether the combination of 
PAN + BTZ + DEX would improve PFS results as compared to PBO + BTZ + DEX in patients with relapsed or 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma requiring re-treatment. Indeed, the comparator in the Phase III study 
D2308, i.e. placebo + BTZ + DEX, is considered appropriate for the study population. The baseline 
characteristics regarding the age, sex, race and ECOG performance status were well balanced between the two 
arms. The median age of the studied patients was 62.1 years with approximately half of the patients being male. 
Most of the patients were of Caucasian origin followed by Asian subjects and the utmost of the patients, i.e. 
93%, had an ECOG status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 37.1 months in the PAN + BTZ + DEX 
arm and 38.9 months in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. Furthermore, all of the included patients had a creatinine 
clearance between 60 and 90 mL/min based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. In addition, most patients in both 
treatment arms entered the study with International Staging System (ISS) Stage I or Stage II disease. The 
disease history was also well balanced between the two treatment arms. Regarding the MM treatment history, 
all but one patient in the study had received at least 1 line of antineoplastic therapy with the median number of 
prior lines being one for both study arms. In this respect, the percentage of patients who had received one prior 
line of anti-MM therapy was 50.9% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 52.0% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. The 
percentage of patients with 2 or 3 prior lines of anti-MM therapy was 48.5% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 
48.0% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. Stem cell transplantation was applied in 55.6% of the patients in the 
experimental arm and 58.8% of the patients in the control arm. Of these, nearly all were in the autologous 
setting with 10 patients in total having received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Of the patients that had 
undergonestem cell transplantation, 90.2% and 95.1% responded to this treatment in the experimental and 
control arm, respectively. Finally, irrespective of the type of last treatment, the majority of patients in both arms 
(88.6% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm, 85.8% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm) responded to their last prior line of 
therapy. At presentation, the majority of patients in both arms had relapsed disease; 63.8% in the PAN + BTZ 
+ DEX arm and 61.7% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. Primary refractory patients were excluded. Together, this 
study population overall represents the expected patient population as defined by the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and the study arms were well balanced regarding patient and disease characteristics as well the type and 
number of prior treatments. In addition, this patient population studied well represents the patient population 
requiring at least 2nd line therapy for MM in the clinical practise.  
Patients were randomized 1:1 to the PAN + BTZ + DEX or to the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm and stratified by a 
number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs 2 or 3) and prior use of BTZ (yes vs no) which in a more or less equal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 84/124 
  
  
number of patients in each study arm, i.e. 387 patients vs 381 patients, respectively, and in well-balanced 
treatment arms regarding the number of prior lines of therapy as well as prior BTZ treatment in both FAS and 
the PP set. 
Treatment arms were also balanced with regard to the number of major protocol deviations. Furthermore, most 
classes of major protocol deviations were reported in small percentages of patients (≤ 3.4%). However, the 
percentage of patients with missing efficacy baseline assessment is remarkable i.e. 19.9% in the experimental 
arm and 22.6% in the control arm, but may be dominated by missing laboratory values. Finally, it is considered 
that the amendments as implemented by the Applicant were not likely to have had negative impact on the 
conduct of the study, the performed (statistical) analyses and/or the results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of the pivotal D2308 study showed that the median PFS (investigator based) was prolonged by 3.9  
months in patients receiving PAN+BTZ+Dex treatment as compared to the PBO+BTZ+Dex control arm, with a 
37% relative risk reduction in the hazard rate of progression/death (HR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.52; 0.76]; 
p-value < 0.0001). The PFS results for the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm (8.1 months) were consistent with prior Phase III 
trials using a BTZ backbone in the same patient population and represent an adequate comparator for the target 
population at hand, i.e. relapsed multiple myeloma. Furthermore, the data are consistent between the 
pre-specified subgroups analyses.  
In addition, all sensitivity analyses yielded a similar HR in favour of PAN and provided consistent support for the 
robustness of the primary analysis results.  
The final number of OS events has not been reached yet. At the time of a second OS interim analysis after 359 
(86.5%) of the target 415 OS events required for the final OS analysis had been observed, the median OS was 
38.24 months in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm and 35.38 months in the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm.  
During the initial evaluation, the CHMP raised a major objection about the indication needing to be further 
discussed, with reference to patients who have received prior bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent, a 
population who formed a pre-specified subgroup in pivotal Study D2308, as having a high unmet medical need 
considering the current limited treatment options for this population. 
Higher efficacy benefits in PFS, and ORR and CR/nCR relative to BTZ+Dex were seen in subjects with prior BTZ 
and IMiD treatment and the data showed that these benefits relative to BTZ+Dex are driven by the lower 
efficacy in the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm. The median PFS (investigator based) was prolonged by 4.8  months in 
patients receiving PAN+BTZ+Dex treatment as compared to the PBO+BTZ+Dex control arm, with a 48% 
relative risk reduction in the hazard rate of progression/death (HR: 0.52; 95% CI [0.36, 0.76], log-rank 
p-value = 0.0005). The absolute duration of 10.6 months median PFS as seen in subjects who have received 
prior BTZ and IMiD treatment is considered of clinical relevance in a population with limited  treatment options. 
In subjects who have received prior BTZ and IMiD treatment the overall response rate using modified EBMT 
criteria was 59% in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm and 41% in the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm.  
The additional analysis in patients who had received at least two prior regimens including BTZ and IMiD showed 
a similar pattern, but with a larger median PFS benefit of 7.8 months with PAN+BTZ+Dex vs PBO+BTZ+Dex 
with a 53% relative risk reduction in the hazard rate of progression/death (HR: 0.47; 95% CI [0.31, 0.72], 
log-rank p value = 0.0003) as compared to the subgroup with prior BTZ and IMiD.  
However, the benefit in PFS  has not been translated into a similar relative benefit in OS which was improved by 
only 3.3 months (HR: 0.92) in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm compared to the PBO+BTZ+Dex in this prior BTZ and 
Assessment report

Page 85/124 
  
  
IMiD subgroup. A larger median OS benefit of 6.6 months was observed in the subgroup of patients who had 
received at least two prior regimens including BTZ and IMiD, however, the final OS analysis is awaited.  To 
further support the PFS benefit, the Applicant will submit the final overall survival analysis for study D2308, 
including a tabulated summary of deaths within 8 months of first dose. Subgroups OS analyses in patients who 
have received at least two prior regimens including BTZ and IMiD agent will also be provided (see conclusions on 
clinical efficacy). 
The results from the EORTC QLQ-C30 captured a consistently negative effect by the experimental regimen 
compared to the control arm with mean changes from baseline in global health status/QOL exceeding the 
threshold defined as a minimal important change (e.g. <5 points). 
Several biomarker assessments were planned for studies B2207 and D2308. Specifically, bone marrow aspirate 
samples were taken at baseline in patients participating in the dose expansion phase of this trial in order to 
perform gene expression analysis to identify potential predictive markers. The CHMP recommended the 
applicant to provide the results for the currently planned or upcoming biomarker studies.  
Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 4 May 2015 to provide advice 
on the following list of questions: 
1. Remaining uncertainty concerning the clinical benefit  
The  SAG  is  asked  to  discuss  whether  the  observed  benefit  of  the  PAN+BTZ+Dex  combination  in 
terms of PFS - in the absence of a significant effect on OS - in MM patients, who had received at 
least one prior therapy, is sufficient to justify exposing these patients to the severe adverse event 
profile of the drug. 
Based on the final analysis of the pivotal study D2308, PAN + BTZ + DEX was associated with a statistically 
significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) (increase in median IRC-based PFS of 3.6 months 
compared to PBO+BTZ+DEX; HR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.76; p<0.0001). The HR for OS (secondary endpoint as 
determined by the second interim analysis) was 0.87 and not statistically significant (95% CI: 0.70, 1.07; 
p=0.18) compared to PBO+BTZ+DEX). The proportion of patients in whom a complete or near complete 
response (CR/nCR) was observed was 27.6% vs 15.7%, for PAN v. PBO, respectively). 
Concerning unfavourable effects, PAN + BTZ + DEX was associated with significant worsening in quality of life 
during the treatment period. In the PAN+BTZ+DEX arm vs. PBO+BZT+DEX arm there were consistently more 
grade 3/4 AEs (96% vs. 82%), SAEs (60% vs. 42%), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (36% vs. 20%), 
and AEs leading to dose adjustment or temporarily dose interruption (89 % vs. 76 %). More patients required 
hospitalization due to AEs in the PAN+BTZ+Dex group (55 % v. 37 %). The main reported AEs were 
thrombocytopenia (G3-4: 67.4% v. 31. 3) with associated haemorrhage (33.3% v. 10.3% of patients received 
at least one platelet transfusion). Other important unfavourable effects included neutropenia (G 3: 34.5% v. 
11.4%; G 4: 6.6% v. 2.4%), severe infections (G3-4: 20.5% v. 15.6%), and diarrhoea (G3-4: 25.5% v. 8. 2%). 
The SAG discussed the observed benefits, risks and remaining uncertainties and disagreed on the balance of 
benefits and risks.  
According to some experts, albeit with some uncertainty, the clinical benefit (although moderate) was 
considered established. The observed effect in terms of PFS was considered clinically important. Based on the 
OS data, it is possible to rule out a detriment in OS based on visual exploration. The lack of a statistically 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 86/124 
  
  
significant difference in OS could actually be due to the relatively long post-PD survival. Transient deterioration 
of QoL during treatment was expected in view of the toxicity profile. The high CR/nCR rate was also considered 
as important and potentially enabling stem cell transplant (SCT). Although pomalidomide and other agents 
could be used in this indication, relapsed/refractory MM remains a setting with very few therapeutic options and 
poor prospect of cure. Panobinostat provides an additional option with a new mechanism of action that can be 
of benefit when all other therapeutic options have failed or when it is preferable to reserve the few available 
options for later lines of treatment. Adequate toxicity management is paramount and expected to improve with 
further experience. Furthermore, future studies will aim to improve the BTZ schedule to decrease toxicity of the 
combination. Given the benefit observed, the small number of alternative treatment options and the high unmet 
medical need, the toxicity profile (although significant) was considered acceptable. According to some of the 
experts and patient representatives, the availability of a new treatment, even if associated with modest benefits 
and significant toxicity is of value for patients. The likelihood of experiencing unfavourable side effects and the 
likelihood of benefit should be clearly described to allow informed treatment choice by physicians and patients, 
considering the available therapeutic options.  
According to a different view, the clinical benefit cannot be considered established. The observed effect in terms 
of PFS cannot be considered clinically relevant in the absence of improved QoL, symptoms or OS. OS did not 
improve by addition of panobinostat. There was no evidence that treatment with panobinostat was associated 
with a higher access to SCT. Based on the available evidence, although there are signs of antitumor activity, it 
is impossible to conclude that a clinical benefit has been established. The B/R was considered negative in view 
of lack of OS benefit, lack of increased access to stem cell transplants and because of the severe toxicity profile 
including increased death rate caused by the addition of panobinostat.  MM is a disease of the elderly. The 
significantly higher toxicity, including a higher number of treatment-related deaths associated with 
panobinostat, especially in elderly patients, makes it impossible to conclude that a positive benefit-risk balance 
has been established. There are other treatments available for relapsed/refractory MM, including pomalidomide. 
Availability of a new agent with a new mechanism of action cannot be considered of benefit unless clinical 
benefits have been established. In order to establish efficacy and that there is a clinical benefit, further data 
should be provided to show at least an improvement of QoL or symptoms in the post-treatment phase, or 
duration of OS, or improved access to SCT. In addition, concerning the risks, further data are needed to 
establish that toxicity can be actively managed and improved without loss of activity, and that different 
schedules of BTZ can improve the tolerability without adversely impacting the presumed efficacy. 
2. Implications of the observed toxicity 
The  SAG  is  asked  to  discuss  the  implications  of  the  observed  toxicity  of  the  PAN+BTZ+Dex 
combination  on its clinical use, especially in elderly patients. Issues that should  be addressed in 
particular  are  the  feasibility  of  the  proposed  dose  regimen  and  the  management  of  the  toxicity 
profile by dose-reductions and/or delays, transfusions, hospitalizations and bone marrow support 
by G-CSF. 
The toxicity was considered significant especially in elderly patients. Dose-reductions were needed in a high 
proportion of patients and there were concerns on whether such reductions might be associated with lower 
antitumor activity in view of the apparent synergistic or additive effect of the combination. Further data to 
assess the impact of dose-reduction on antitumor activity and tolerability was considered essential to address 
these concerns. 
According to some experts, the proposed dose regimen was feasible and the toxicity manageable and expected 
to improve based on clinical experience, active management of elderly patients according to current guidelines, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 87/124 
  
  
and less intensive doses of BTZ+Dex. According to a different view, the feasibility and tolerability of the current 
regimen was questionable (see answers to question No. 1). 
3. Identification of a suitable population where the B/R is considered positive 
The  SAG  is  asked  to  discuss  whether  the  B/R  of  PAN+BTZ+Dex  could  be  deemed  positive  in  a 
subset of more advanced patients within the scope of the applicant’s proposed indication; e.g. for 
MM patients with relapsed/refractory disease who have received  at least 2, 3 or more prior lines of 
therapy (including BTZ and immunomodulatory drugs). 
Exploratory efficacy subgroup analyses (e.g., by number of prior lines of treatment) did not allow identifying a 
population most likely to respond. 
However, the SAG identified a subpopulation in which the unmet need is higher, in view of the poor prognosis 
and few available treatment options. This subpopulation corresponds to MM patients with relapsed/refractory 
disease who have received at least 2 lines of therapy, including BTZ and immunomodulatory drugs. (The SAG 
was uncertain whether this indication could be further generalised, e.g., to proteasome inhibitors as data are 
lacking to rule out important pharmacodynamic differences between different agents.) 
The SAG did not agree on whether a positive benefit-risk balance has been established in this population. 
According to one view, the observed benefit and toxicity were acceptable in this high unmet need situation, 
despite the existing uncertainty about the clinical relevance of the observed effect and the possibility to actively 
manage toxicity in clinical practice. According to an opposite view, even in this high unmet need situation, the 
lack of clearly established benefits did not outweigh the observed risks, despite the few available treatment 
options (see answers to question No. 1). 
4. Role of panobinostat in patients resistant or refractory to bortezomib 
The SAG is asked to discuss whether the activity data for panabinostat in patients with bortezomib 
resistant/refractory  disease  are  sufficient  to  support  an  indication  that  does  not  exclude  these 
patients.  Patients  with  bortezomib  resistant/refractory  disease  were  excluded  from  the  pivotal 
trial, but were enrolled in the single arm study DUS71 and data may be supported by non-clinical 
data. 
The SAG agreed that the antitumor activity appeared to be similar between these subgroups based on indirect 
comparisons of results from the phase 3 and phase 2 studies. Nevertheless, the activity has to be seen in the 
light of the known toxicity of the product (see answer to question No. 1). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study D2308 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of panobinostat in terms of the primary 
endpoint PFS, in a subpopulation in which the unmet need is higher, in view of the poor prognosis and few 
available treatment options. This subpopulation corresponds to MM patients with relapsed and/or refractory 
disease who have received at least 2 lines of therapy, including BTZ and immunomodulatory drugs. The addition 
of panobinostat to bortezomib and dexamethasone combination resulted in a clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS compared to the placebo + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone combination in the above mentioned subgroup (see Discussion on the benefit-risk balance). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 88/124 
  
  
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): The Applicant shall submit the final survival analysis for study D2308, 
including a tabulated summary of deaths within 8 months of first dose. Subgroups OS analyses in the patients 
who have received at least two prior regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent shall also 
be provided. This post authorisation measure is included in the Annex II. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The main safety data has been obtained from the randomised, placebo controlled pivotal Study D2308 in 
relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory MM patients in which PAN + BTZ + DEX (n=381) was compared with PBO 
+ BTZ + DEX (n=377). Additional safety data concerning the treatment of MM patients with PAN + BTZ + DEX 
became available from the expansion phase of the single arm dose escalation Phase Ib Study B2207 (n=15) and 
from the single arm Phase II Study DUS71 (n=55) in BTZ refractory patients.  
The safety data of panobinostat have been assessed from a total of 451 patients with multiple myeloma treated 
with panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone and 38 patients with multiple myeloma 
treated with panobinostat as a single agent (see SmPC section 4.8). 
In addition, data from 5 studies including a total of 240 patients with other haematological malignancies and 
solid tumours (Table 39) were included to provide additional information for single agent panobinostat 20 mg 
administered once daily, three times a week (tiw), every week or every other week.

A patient is counted only once in each category. n is the number of patients. Duration of exposure (days) = [(Last dosing date 
of any study treatment component – date of first administration of any study treatment component) + 1]. 
In Study D2308 for panobinostat the median overall relative dose intensity (RDI: overall actual dose intensity / 
overall  planned  dose  intensity  x100)  was  80.7%  for  panobinostat,  it  decreased  to  75.0%  at  cycle  4  and 
remained stable through the remainder of the trial. For bortezomib the median overall RDI in Study D2308 was 
75.7%.  
The total cumulative exposure in Study DUS71 was 305 months and in Study D2308 it was 2297 months. The 
exposure adjusted rate of any AE in Studies DUS71 and D2308, was respectively 17.7 versus 16.5 per 100 
person treatment months and the exposure adjusted rates of grade 3/4 AEs was respectively 16.1 versus 15.8 
per 100 person treatment months. In study D2308, 50.9% of patients had at least one dose change compared 
to 63.6% in Study Dus71 and this confounds the evaluation of the exposure adjusted rate of AEs as it  was 
apparently based on any study treatment component.

Clinically notable AEs (CNAE) are selected categories of risks consisting of pooled AEs that are similar in nature 
and for which there is a specific clinical interest in connection with the mechanism of action of panobinostat 
(DAC inhibitors), non-clinical studies and signals observed during the conduct of the clinical development 
program. Based on these criteria, 17 groups of CNAEs were identified and analysed.  
These 17 groups of CNAEs are: QT prolongation, myelosuppression, haemorrhage, severe infections, hepatic 
dysfunction, renal dysfunction, diarrhoea, cardiac failure, ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrythmia, venous 
thromboembolism, ischaemic colitis, interstitial lung disease, hypothyroidism, pericardial effusion, acute 
pancreatitis and hepatitis B reactivation. The most frequently observed CNAEs were diarrhoea, neutropenia 
associated with infections and thrombocytopenia associated with haemorrhage. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In Study D2308, thrombocytopenia was a common safety finding in both treatment arms with a higher incidence 
of the adverse event thrombocytopenia reported in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm compared to the PBO + BTZ + 
DEX arm (64.6% vs 40.8%). Most of these events were of Grade 3/4 severity (57.0% vs 24.9%). The AE 
thrombocytopenia was present in 65.0% of the patients of the pooled PAN + BTZ + DEX data set and for 58.1% 
it was a Grade 3/4 event.  
Based on laboratory data on platelet count, the number of patients in Study D2308 with thrombocytopenia was 
much higher. In the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm, any grade thrombocytopenia was 
reported in 97.6% vs 88.1% of patients, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was reported for 32.5% vs 19.6% and 
Grade 4 for 34.6% vs 12.2%. 
The median time to recovery to Grade 0, 1, or 2 from first reported Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was the same 
(12 days or 0.39 months) for the two treatment groups. Following an initial decrease in median platelet counts 
in the first two weeks of treatment, a return to baseline was observed by Day 1 of the subsequent cycle in both 
treatment arms. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhages were observed in both treatment arms in Study D2308. The rate of haemorrhages of any grade 
was 20.7% for patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 11.7% for patients in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. Grade 
3/4 haemorrhages were 4.2% vs 2.4% respectively.  
In study D2308, reported haemorrhage events (≥ 1%), (PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs PBO + BTZ + DEX arm) 
included epistaxis (4.7% vs 4.0%), haematoma (2.6% vs 1.1%), contusion (2.4% vs 2.1%), conjunctival 
haemorrhage (2.1% vs 0.5%), GI haemorrhage (1.3% vs 0.8%), gingival bleeding (1.0% vs 1.1%), 
haematochezia (1.0% vs 0.5%), and haematuria (1.0% vs 0.0%). Grade 3/4 severity haemorrhage reported in 
2 or more patients included GI haemorrhage (0.8% vs 0.8%), gastric haemorrhage (0.5% vs 0.0%), 
hematemesis (0.5% vs 0.0%), cerebral haemorrhage (0.0% vs 0.5%) and contusion (0.0% vs 0.5%). Five

patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm died of events associated with haemorrhage (2 gastrointestinal, 2 
pulmonary, and 1 cerebral haemorrhage). 
In the combination pooled data set, 95 patients (21.1%) experienced haemorrhagic events with only a low 
number (4.0%) of patients experiencing events of Grade 3/4 severity. 
Severe infections 
In Study D2308 the incidence of severe infections in the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients was 20.5 % vs 21.5 
%  in  the  PBO  +  BTZ  +  DEX  treated  patients.  Incidence  of  Grade  3/4 events was  20.5%  vs  15.6%.  Severe 
infections were reported in 121 patients (26.8%) in the combination pooled data set and 20.8% were of Grade 
3/4 severity. 
Pneumonia and sepsis 
In study D2308, adverse events falling within the grouping of pneumonia were reported more frequently in the 
PAN + BTZ+ DEX arm than in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm (23.9% vs 18.6%) with Grade 3/4 reported in 15.7 vs 
12.7 respectively. The single AE of “pneumonia” was also were more frequently reported in the PAN + BTZ + 
DEX arm than in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm (17.1% vs 12.7% with Grade 3/4 frequency 12.6% vs 10.4%.)  
In Study D2308, AEs in the grouping sepsis were reported for 6.6% of patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 
in 4.0% of patients in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. In the combination pooled data set AEs in the grouping sepsis 
were reported for 7.3 % of patients. 
Neutropenia 
In Study D2308, neutropenia (based on laboratory data) was reported in 75.0% of patients treated with PAN + 
BTZ  +  DEX  and  in  35.5%  of  those  treated  with  PBO  +  BTZ  +  DEX  (Grade  3/4  neutropenia  was  also  more 
frequently reported in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm than in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm (34.5% of patients vs 
11.4%) as was Grade 4 neutropenia (6.6% vs 2.4%). Febrile neutropenia as a Grade 3/4 adverse event was 
reported in 1.0% of the patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm, 0.5% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm, and in 1.3% 
in the pooled PAN + BTZ + DEX data set. Furthermore, 13.1% of patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm received 
granulocyte colony stimulating factors vs 4.2% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. 
Diarrhoea 
In the Phase III Study D2308, diarrhoea was reported in 68.2% of patients treated with PAN + BTZ + DEX 
(Grade 3/4; 25.5%), as compared with 41.6% (Grade 3/4; 8.0%) in patients treated with PBO + BTZ+ DEX. 
Among the patients reporting diarrhoea of Grade 3 or 4 in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm, the vast majority (24.1%) 
had Grade 3 events and 1.3% of patients had diarrhoea of Grade 4.  
Cardiac related events 
Cardiac events (most frequently atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitation and sinus tachycardia) were reported 
in 17.6% of panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients versus 9.8% of placebo + 
bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients and syncope events were reported in 6.0% versus 2.4% 
respectively (see SmPC section 4.8). 
In Study D2308, ischemic heart disease was reported in 14 patients (3.7%) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 
in 5 patients (1.3%) in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. For 8 patients (2.1%) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and for 
1 patient (0.3%) in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm this was a Grade 3/4 event. The most frequently occurring AE in 
the PAN + BTZ +DEX arm was angina pectoris (6 patients, 1.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 94/124 
  
  
In PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients compared to PBO + BTZ + DEX-treated patients there is a general trend 
towards  a  higher  frequency  of  increased  pulse  rate  (4.6%  vs  3.0%)  and  a  higher  frequency  of  lower  blood 
pressure (systolic pressure 5.7% vs 4.3% and diastolic pressure 2.2% vs 0.2%). 
The frequency of reporting of the adverse event of sinus tachycardia was 2.4% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs 
0.3%) in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. 
No episodes of QTcF prolongation >500 msec were reported with the dose of 20 mg panobinostatin the phase III 
clinical study, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.  A >60 ms change from baseline in QTcF 
interval was seen in 3 patients (0.8%) and four patients (1.1%), respectively. An absolute QTcF interval of >450 
ms and ≤ 480 ms was observed in 40 patients (10.8%) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 26 patients (7.1%) in 
the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. A change from baseline of >30 ms and ≤60 msec in QTcF interval was seen in 55 
patients (14.5%) and 41 patients (10.9%), respectively.  In Study DUS71, there were two patients (3.7%) with 
an absolute QTcF interval of >450 ms and ≤ 480 and three patients (5.5%) with an increase from baseline in 
QTcF interval >30 ms. In Study B2207, none of the patients experienced a notable QTcF value. 
Pooled  clinical  data  from  over  500  patients  treated  with  panobinostat  alone  in  multiple  indications  and  at 
different dose levels have shown that the incidence of CTC grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec) was 
approximately 1% overall and 5% or more at a dose of 60 mg or higher; no episodes of torsades de pointes were 
observed. 
Concomitant  medications  with  known  risks  of  QT  prolongation  (e.g.  azithromycin,  clarithromycin,  and 
moxifloxacin) were received by 35.7% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and 27.9% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm). 
For both treatment groups in the 3 studies, the vast majority (>90%) of the patients who took such medications 
did not experience QTcF prolongation >60 ms from baseline or QTcF >480 ms. In addition, among those few 
patients who did experience such low grade QTcF interval prolongation, no apparent difference in frequency was 
observed between those who took concomitant medications with potential impact on QTc intervals and those 
who did not. 
In study D2308 the percentage of patients with newly occurring qualitative ECG abnormalities was 63.5% in the 
PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs 42.2% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm.  
Sinus tachycardia was also observed more frequently in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm (15.5% in PAN + BTZ + DEX 
vs 6.8% in PBO +BTZ + DEX). 
T-wave changes were reported in 39.6% of patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm and in 18.3% of those in the 
PBO + BTZ + DEX arm, but no cases were reported as SAEs or as causes for treatment discontinuation. ST-T 
segment changes, primarily involving ST-T depression were reported in 21.7% of patients in the PAN + BTZ + 
DEX arm and in 3.6% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm.  
Regardless of events chronology, syncope was reported in 9% of patients with ST-T depression and 7.2% of 
patients with T wave change and 4.9% of patients with neither of these ECG abnormalities. Likewise ischaemic 
heart disease (including myocardial infarction and ischaemia) were reported in 4.5% of patients with ST-T 
depression and 4.5% of patients with T wave change and 2.7% of patients with neither of these ECG 
abnormalities. 
Renal dysfunction 
In Study D2308, events related to renal dysfunction were reported in 72 patients (18.9%) of the PAN + BTZ + 
DEX arm and 41 patients (10.9%) of the PBO + BTZ+ DEX arm. A low number of 5.0% and 4.5% of these 
patients, respectively experienced events of Grade 3/4 severity. The most frequently occurring AEs (≥ 2%) in 
the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs PBO + BTZ + DEX were blood creatinine increased (10.0% vs 5.8%), blood urea 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 95/124 
  
  
increased (5.2% vs 2.7%), renal failure acute (3.1% vs 3.2%) and renal failure (2.6% vs 1.9%). None of the 
patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm had renal dysfunction AEs that led to study treatment discontinuation. The 
pattern for the combination pooled dataset is nearly the same as observed in Study D2308. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
Events related to hepatic dysfunction were reported in 63 of the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients (16.5%) and 
46 of the PBO + BTZ + DEX-treated patients (12.2%) in Study D2308 with 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively with 
Grade 3/4 severity. The most frequent occurring AEs (≥ 2%) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm were ALT increased 
(6.0%),  hypoalbuminaemia  (5.5%),  aspartate  AST  increased  (4.5%),  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased 
(2.9%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2.4%) and hyperbilirubinaemia (2.4%). In the pooled dataset, 
the numbers were almost identical to those of the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients in Study D2308. 
Second Primary Malignancy 
A total of five (1.3%) patients in the experimental arm vs. 11 (2.9%) for the control arm reported AEs in the 
SOC of neoplasms. One case each of basal cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, and thyroid neoplasm (benign 
goiter, grade 1/2) were reported in the experimental arm with the remaining two involving cancer pain and 
tumour pain. Among the 11 patients in the control arm, eight cases reported different types of neoplasms 
including two cases of small cell lung cancer and one case each of lipoma, melanocytic naevus, prostate 
neoplasm, skin neoplasm, prostate cancer, and rectal cancer. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
In the Phase III Study D2308, SAEs regardless of study drug relationship were reported more frequently in 
patients treated in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm compared with those in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm (59.8% vs 
41.6%) (Table 44). 
Table 44: SAEs by primary SOC and PT irrespective of causality (with at least 5.0% incidence by PT 
in either group) (D2308 Safety Set) 
In the pooled data set, SAEs regardless of study relationship were frequently reported (≥ 10%) in the SOCs of 
infections and infestations (30.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (17.7%), blood and lymphatic disorders (14.4%) 
and general disorders and administration site conditions (11.8%). Similarly, thrombocytopenia (10.6%), 
diarrhoea (10.2%), and pneumonia (14.2%) were more commonly reported. 
In the Phase III Study D2308, SAEs suspected to be study drug related were reported more frequently in 
patients treated in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm as compared with those in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm (34.9% vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 96/124 
 
  
  
15.1%). The more common drug-related SAEs were thrombocytopenia (5.8% vs 1.6%), diarrhoea (7.9% vs 
1.6%) and pneumonia (8.1% vs 3.4%). In the pooled data set, SAEs suspected to be study drug related were 
frequently reported (≥ 10%) in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (12.4%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(11.5%) and blood and lymphatic disorders (11.1%). The more common drug-related SAEs were 
thrombocytopenia (8.9%), diarrhoea (7.3%) and pneumonia (7.5%). 
Deaths 
On-treatment deaths were defined as deaths occurring on treatment and up to 28 days after discontinuation of 
study treatment.  
In the pivotal Study D2308, a total of 48 deaths occurred on treatment (death that occurred within 28 days of 
the last dose of study drug); 30 (7.9%) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs 18 (4.8%) in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. 
The main causes of on-treatment deaths by SOC were infections and infestations (1.8% vs 1.3% in PBO + BTZ 
+ DEX), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.6% vs 0.5% in PBO + BTZ + DEX), and cardiac 
disorders (1.0% vs 0.8% in PBO + BTZ + DEX) and Study indication (1.0% vs 1.6% in PBO + BTZ + DEX) (Table

In the pooled data set, 36 deaths (8.0%) occurred on treatment; 7 deaths (1.6%) due to study indication and 
29 (6.4%) due to other causes. About the same percentage was seen in the individual studies for the PAN + BTZ 
+ DEX-treated patients. In Study B2207, two deaths (13.3%) were on-treatment and in Study DUS71 there 
were four on-treatment deaths (7.3%). The most notable causes of death in the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated 
patients were infection and haemorrhage. 
Laboratory findings 
The most common haematological and biochemical abnormalities in the pivotal D2308 study are summarised in 
the following Tables.

There was a generally higher frequency of electrolyte abnormalities with PAN + BTZ + DEX compared to PBO + 
BTZ + DEX, in particular of hypokalemia, for which 5% of patients required dose adjustment or interruption and 
led to discontinuation in 0.8% (3 patients). 
Thyroid function 
Based on pre-clinical findings, hypothyroidism is considered a potential safety risk monitored in the 
panobinostat clinical development program. Accordingly, shifts in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free 
thyroxine (T4) values from baseline to extreme post-baselines values were assessed. Of those patients with 
normal T4 levels at baseline, shifts to a higher value occurred in 4.2% of patients in both arms. Shifts to lower 
values were slightly higher for the experimental arm (6.3%) than the control arm (2.4%). 
Safety in special populations 
All 221 patients <65 years and 159 of the 160 patients ≥ 65 years in the experimental arm experienced at least 
one AE. In general the incidence of AEs was lower in the patients <65 years in the following SOCs: Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders, 74.7% of the patients <65 years had an AE and 86.9% of the patients ≥ 65 years 
with thrombocytopenia (58.8% vs. 72.5%); Gastrointestinal disorders 84.6% vs.91.9% with diarrhoea (63.3% 
vs. 75.0%); General disorders and administration site conditions 72.4% vs. 80.0% with fatigue (36.7% vs. 
47.5%). For Infections and infestations it was 73.3% vs. 62.5% with pneumonia (16.7% vs. 17.5%). A similar 
pattern was seen for the control arm. Furthermore, 125 of the 126 patients aged ≥ 65 to <75 years and all 34 
patients ≥ 75 years experienced at least one AE. In the control arm the corresponding numbers were 132 and 
28 patients, respectively. In general the incidence of AEs was lower in the patients aged ≥ 65 to <75 years than 
for patients ≥ 75 years in the experimental arm, for example thrombocytopenia (71.4% vs. 76.5%), diarrhoea 
(71.4% vs. 88.2%) and fatigue (45.2% vs. 55.9%). Similarly, the main difference with higher frequency in 
patients ≥ 75 years was seen for the common AEs reported such as thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, 
fatigue/asthenia, and hypotension. 
In the experimental arm, all 201 males experienced at least one AE, as did 179 of the 180 (99.4%) females. In 
the control arm the number and frequency of male or female patients with AEs was 204/205 (99.5%) and 
172/172(100.0%), respectively. The frequencies for the AEs with notable differences in the experimental arm 
are as follows for men vs. women respectively: anaemia (39.8% vs. 43.3%), thrombocytopenia (59.7% vs. 
70.0%), neutropenia (24.4% vs. 36.1%), diarrhoea (67.2% vs. 69.4%), nausea (29.9% vs. 43.3%), vomiting 
(18.9% vs. 33.3%), fatigue (38.3% vs. 44.4%), pneumonia (23.4% vs. 10%), and muscle spasms (10.0% vs. 
1.7%). 
In the experimental arm, there were 244 Caucasian patients, 127 Asian and 10 Other. Almost all of them 
experienced AEs during the study. In the control arm the number of Caucasian, Asian and Other race patients 
was 247, 103 and 27, respectively, and the AE frequency was 99.6%, 100.0%, and 100.0%, respectively. The 
notable AEs in the experimental arm are as follows for Caucasian vs. Asian: thrombocytopenia (60.7% vs. 
70.1%), diarrhoea (66.4% vs. 71.7%), fatigue (48.4% vs. 26.8%), hypokalemia (18.4% vs. 44.9%), 
decreased appetite (20.9% vs. 43.3%), pneumonia (12.7% vs. 26.0%), hypoesthesia (3.7% vs. 15.0%), 
hepatic function abnormal (0.0% vs. 3.9%), gastroenteritis (2.5% vs. 4.7%), and herpes zoster (2.9% vs. 
8.7%). 
In addition, events related to hepatic dysfunction were reported in 63 of the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients 
(16.5%) and 46 of the PBO + BTZ + DEX-treated patients (12.2%) in Study D2308 with 4.2% and 3.4%, 
respectively with Grade 3/4 severity. The most frequent occurring AEs (≥ 2%) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm 
were ALT increased (6.0%), hypoalbuminaemia (5.5%), aspartate AST increased (4.5%), blood alkaline

phosphatase increased (2.9%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2.4%) and hyperbilirubinaemia 
(2.4%).  
In the pooled dataset, the numbers were almost identical to those of the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients in 
Study D2308.  In the study LBH589X2101hepatic impairment increased the plasma exposure of panobinostat by 
43%, moderate impairment increased the plasma exposure by 105%.  
In the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm of Study D2308, 84.5% of patients had normal baseline hepatic function vs. 55 
(14.4%) with mild hepatic impairment and in the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm, these percentages were 86.7% and 
13.0% respectively.  
In the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm of Study D2308 the results are as follows for renal impairment and no renal 
impairment, respectively: thrombocytopenia (67.7% vs 57.6%), diarrhoea (70.0% vs 64.4%) and fatigue 
(39.5% vs 44.9%). Additional analysis was performed of the frequency of AEs according to the degree of renal 
impairment. It must be noted that there were only 11 patients in each arm with severe renal impairment. 
In the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm the rates of SAEs in patients with normal renal function, mild renal impairment, 
moderate  renal impairment and severe renal impairment respectively were 45%, 61%, 72%, and 91%. In the 
PBO+BTZ+Dex arm the corresponding rates of SAEs were 33%, 44%, 51% and 46% respectively. 
The Applicant has presented the age distribution of patients with renal impairment at baseline (Study D2308, 
FAS) and it can be seen that in the PAN+BTZ+Dex arm the median age for normal renal function was 56 years, 
for mild renal impairment it was 65 years, for moderate 68 years and for severe its was 74 years. The median 
age and age ranges for the categories of renal function were almost the same in the PBO+BTZ+Dex arm.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Please refer to pharmacokinetic drug interactions and the discussion on clinical pharmacology.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Phase III Study D2308, study treatment discontinuation due to AEs was 36.2% (138 patients), in the PAN 
+ BTZ + DEX combination therapy arm and 20.4% (77 patients) in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm. The SOCs with 
the highest percentage (≥ 1%) of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug for the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm 
were nervous system disorders (8.1%) with peripheral neuropathy (3.7% vs 1.9% for PBO + BTZ + DEX), 
gastrointestinal disorders (7.3%) with diarrhoea (4.5% vs 1.6% for PBO + BTZ + DEX), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (7.3%) with asthenia (2.9% vs 0% for PBO +BTZ + DEX) and fatigue (2.9% for 
both treatment groups), and infections and infestations (5.0%) with pneumonia (1.3% vs 2.1% for PBO + BTZ 
+ DEX).In the pooled data set, 153 patients (33.9%) discontinued treatment due to AE. Most frequent AEs (≥ 
1%) leading to discontinuation in the pooled data set were diarrhoea (4.2%), peripheral neuropathy (3.8%), 
fatigue (3.5%), asthenia (3.1%), pneumonia (1.6%), and thrombocytopenia (1.3%). 
In the Phase III Study D2308, the overall incidence of AEs requiring dose adjustments was 88.7% in the PAN + 
BTZ + DEX vs 75.6% in   the PBO + BTZ + DEX treatment arms. The AEs requiring dose adjustments reported 
more frequently in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm of study D2308 (with a ≥ 5% difference between the treatment 
arms) were thrombocytopenia (31.0% vs 10.9% for PBO + BTZ + DEX), diarrhoea (26.0% vs 9.0% for PBO 
+BTZ + DEX), neutropenia (10.2% vs 2.4% for PBO + BTZ + DEX) and fatigue (16.3% vs 7.2% for PBO + BTZ 
+ DEX).In the pooled data set, 397 patients (88.0%) experienced AEs that required dose adjustments or 
interruptions. The AEs requiring dose adjustments were (with a ≥ 10% occurrence) thrombocytopenia (32.2%), 
diarrhoea (24.6%), fatigue (17.1%), peripheral neuropathy (12.2%) and neutropenia (10.2%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data reported are based on the phase III clinical study (Panorama 1) in 381 patients with multiple 
myeloma treated with 20 mg panobinostat once a day three times per week, on a 2 weeks on and 1 week off 
dosing regimen in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. The median duration of study treatment 
exposure (any component) was longer in the control arm compared to the experimental arm (6.7 months and 
5.4 months respectively). In the control arm 54 % of the patients endured treatment ≥ 6 months compared to 
47 % in the experimental arm. The mean relative dose intensity was overall higher in the control arm for all 
three compounds. It is concluded that the add-on by panobinostat to bortezomib and dexamethasone 
unfavourably affects the tolerability for all three compounds. 
There are no major differences in the safety profile between the prior BTZ and IMiD subgroup and the overall 
population. There are also no major differences in the safety profile between the subgroups according to number 
of prior lines of treatment and the overall population or amongst these subgroups. There are no additional safety 
factors with regard to adverse events in these subgroups that need to be taken into account when considering 
the B/R in any subgroup. 
Notably, there is an overlap in toxicity profiles of panobinostat and bortezomib in the context of primarily GI 
disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), haematology (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) and fatigue. 
Although it is recognized that a similar proportion of patients between the two treatment-arms reported least 
one AE, there was consistently a higher proportion of grade 3/4 AEs (96% vs. 82%), SAEs (60% vs. 42%), AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation (36% vs. 20%), AEs leading to dose adjustment or temporarily dose 
interruption (89 % vs. 76 %) and on-treatment deaths (8 % vs.5 %) in the experimental compared to the 
control arm.  
As may be anticipated given the overlapping toxicity profiles, the most frequent AEs suspected to be 
drug-related included blood disorders (primarily thrombocytopenia [51%, all grades] neutropenia [22%, all 
grades] and anaemia (25%, all grades), GI toxicities (primarily diarrhoea [51%, all grades], nausea [23%, all 
grades] and vomiting [16 %, all grades]), and constitutional disorders such as fatigue (31 %, all grades). 
A quite substantial proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to an AE in the experimental arm 
compared to the control arm (36 % vs.20 %). The single most frequent AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuations were diarrhoea (4.5% and 1.6%, respectively), fatigue (2.9% both arms), asthenia (2.9% and 
0, respectively), and peripheral neuropathy (3.7% and 1.9%, respectively). The most frequent according to 
SOCs leading to discontinuations in the experimental arm were Nervous system disorders (8.1%), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (7.3%), General disorders and administration site conditions (7.3%), Infections 
(5.0%). 
Consistent with the findings in regard to discontinuations, more patients in the experimental arm were in need 
of study drug interruption or dose adjustment (89 %) compared to the control arm (76 %). The main causes 
pertained to thrombocytopenia (31 % vs. 11 %), diarrhoea (26 % vs. 9 %), fatigue (16 % vs. 7 %) and 
pneumonia (11 % vs. 8 %).  
In study D2308 in the overall population (n=758) the rate of deaths on-treatment, but not due to the study 
indication of MM, was twice as high in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm (6.8%) compared to the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 102/124 
  
  
(3.2%) and in the subpopulation of patients having received prior BTZ and IMIDs and ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy 
these rates were 6.9% and 4.1% respectively. For comparison, the rate of on-treatment deaths due to the 
disease was 1.0% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm compared to 1.6% the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm and in the 
subpopulation of patients having received prior BTZ and IMIDs and ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy these rates were 
0% and 2.7% respectively.  
As part of a post authorisation measure which is included in the Annex II, the Applicant shall submit the final 
survival analysis for study D2308, including a tabulated summary of deaths within 8 months of first dose and 
also an analysis in the patients who have received at least two prior regimens including bortezomib and an 
immunomodulatory agent.  
The SmPC contains recommendations for patient monitoring and for dose modifications, interruption or 
discontinuation in case of adverse events (see below).   
Due to the nature of multiple myeloma and the known haematotoxicity for panobinostat and its combination 
agent bortezomib, thrombocytopenia, often severe, has been frequently observed. CTC grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 256 patients, with a median onset time of one month. However, 
thrombocytopenia is reversible (median time to recovery of 12 days) and can usually be managed by dose 
adjustment and interruption with or without platelet transfusion (see section 4.4). 33.3% patients in the 
panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm and 10.3% patients in the placebo + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone arm received platelet transfusions during treatment (See SmPC section 4.8). 
Thrombocytopenia rarely leads to treatment discontinuation (1.6% of patients). Most patients with 
thrombocytopenia did not experience haemorrhage. 20.7% of patients experienced haemorrhage, most 
frequently epistaxis (4.7%), haematoma (2.6%), and conjunctival haemorrhage (2.1%). CTC grade 3 or 4 
haemorrhage was reported in 4.2% of patients, mostly commonly involving gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Five 
patients (1.3%) died of events associated with haemorrhage. Amongst the patients who died of haemorrhage, 
one patient had thrombocytopenia grade 4, three patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3 and 1 patient had 
thrombocytopenia grade 1 (See SmPC section 4.8). 
Therefore, physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of thrombocytopenia and the potential 
for haemorrhage, especially in patients with coagulation disorders or in those who are receiving chronic anti 
coagulation therapy (See SmPC section 4.4). Interaction with warfarin has been classified as a potential risk in 
the Risk Management Plan. 
Dose modification recommendations, monitoring of blood counts including platelet count (in particular before 
each injection of bortezomib), recommendation of platelet transfusion in case of thrombocytopenia is provided 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  Severe haemorrhage and myelosuppression have been classified as identified risks 
in the Risk Management Plan. 
Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients are at risk of infections. Potential contributing factors may 
include prior history of chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, the nature of the disease and neutropenia or 
lymphopenia associated with Farydak treatment (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Localised and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections 
such as aspergillosis or candidiasis, and viral infections including hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex, have 
been reported in patients taking panobinostat. Some of these infections (e.g. pneumonia) have been severe 
(e.g. leading to sepsis, or respiratory or multi organ failure) and have had fatal outcomes. Of note, whereas 
grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia were observed in 28% and 7% of patients, respectively, febrile neutropenia 
was observed in 1% of patients (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 103/124 
  
  
The most frequently reported infections include upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia and 
nasopharyngitis. Fatalities involving either pneumonia or sepsis were reported. Treatment discontinuation due 
to infections was reported in 5% of patients (see SmPC section 4.8). Severe infections (including sepsis/ 
pneumonia) have been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan and Reactivation of Hepatitis 
B Infection has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with panobinostat. Farydak treatment 
should not be initiated in patients with active infections. Pre-existing infections should be treated prior to 
initiation of the therapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infections during treatment 
with panobinostat; if a diagnosis of infection is made, appropriate anti-infective treatment should be instituted 
promptly and interruption or discontinuation of Farydak considered. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal 
infection is made, panobinostat should be discontinued and appropriate anti-fungal therapy instituted (see 
SmPC section 4.4).  
Neutropenia was frequently reported on the basis of laboratory findings determined during the study (all 
grades: 75%). Most newly occurring severe neutropenia was grade 3 (28%), with considerably fewer cases of 
grade 4 (6.6%). While many patients developed neutropenia, febrile neutropenia only occurred in a fraction of 
treated patients (1.0%, both for CTC all grades and for grades 3 and 4). Patients with neutropenia are prone to 
infection, mostly upper respiratory tract infection or pneumonia. Only 0.3% of the patients were discontinued 
from the treatment due to neutropenia (See SmPC section 4.8).  
Neutropenia may require temporary or permanent dose reduction. In the event of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 
physicians should consider the use of growth factors (e.g. G CSF) according to local guidelines. Discontinuation 
of treatment may be considered if neutropenia does not improve despite the dose modifications and/or despite 
the addition of granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy according to local medical practice and treatment 
guidelines, and/or in the event of severe secondary infections. Instructions for dose interruptions and reductions 
for panobinostat are described in Table 5 in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Severe nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting, sometimes requiring the use of anti emetic and anti 
diarrhoeal medicinal products, have been reported in patients treated with Farydak. However, treatment 
discontinuation due to these reactions was reported in a relatively small proportion of patients, with diarrhea at 
4.5% and nausea and vomiting at 0.5% each (see SmPC section 4.8). Patients should be advised to contact 
their physician if severe gastrointestinal toxicity occurs and dose adjustment or discontinuation may be required 
(see SmPC section 4.4). Fluid and electrolyte blood levels, especially potassium, magnesium and phosphate, 
should be monitored periodically during therapy and corrected as clinically indicated to prevent potential 
dehydration and electrolyte disturbances (see SmPC section 4.2). Prophylactic anti emetics (e.g. 
prochlorperezine) may be considered at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with local medical 
practice. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a known risk of QT prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, 
ondansetron and tropisetron should be used with caution (see SmPC section 4.5). 
At the first sign of abdominal cramping, loose stools or onset of diarrhoea, it is recommended that the patient 
be treated with anti-diarrheal medicinal product (e.g. loperamide) or any additional treatment in accordance 
with local treatment guidelines. Replacement intravenous fluids and electrolytes may be used as appropriate. 
Medicinal products with laxative properties should be used with caution because of the potential for 
exacerbation of diarrhea. Patients should be advised to contact their physician to discuss the use of any laxative 
product (see SmPC section 4.4). Severe diarrhoea has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk 
Management Plan.

The incidence of the important AEs thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, raised creatinine and dehydration was 
increased markedly already in patients ≥ 65 years in PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients as compared to the PBO 
+ BTZ + DEX arm. The increase in frequency once patients were ≥ 75 years was less marked. This suggested 
that the increased susceptibility to these adverse events may start already at the relatively younger age of 65 
years. On the other hand, it is also noted that the rate at which AEs led to discontinuation in patients ≥ 65 years 
was approximately 1.5 times that in in patients < 65 years in both PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients (45.0% 
vs 29.9%) and in PBO + BTZ + DEX-treated patients (25.6% vs 16.6%). In addition, it should also be 
considered that the rate of on-treatment deaths not due to disease progression was relatively higher in PAN + 
BTZ + DEX-treated patients ≥ 65 years (8.8% vs 5.4%), but was fairly similar in PBO + BTZ + DEX-treated 
patients (5.6% for age ≥ 65 years vs 2.8% for age <65 years). Increased toxicity in elderly patients (aged 65 
years or above) has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
In addition, sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC provides recommendations on more frequent monitoring of 
patients over 65 years of age, especially for thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity and consideration of 
dose adjustment of panobinostat, bortezomib and/or dexamethasone in elderly patients above 75 years of age. 
Hepatic dysfunction, primarily mild transient elevations in aminotransferases and total bilirubin, have been 
reported in patients during treatment with panobinostat. Liver function should be monitored prior to treatment 
and regularly during treatment. If results of liver function tests show abnormalities according to the NCI CTEP 
classification, dose adjustments for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment are recommended and 
the patient should be followed until values return to normal or pretreatment levels. Panobinostat should not be 
administered in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to lack of experience and safety data in this 
population. Adjustment of bortezomib dose should also be considered (see SmPC section 4.4). Hepatic 
dysfunction and use in patients with hepatic impairment have been classified as potential risks in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Hypothyroidism events were reported in 8 of 381 patients treated with panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone in Study D2308, of whom 2 required treatment. Thyroid and pituitary function should be 
monitored by measuring hormone levels (e.g. free T4 and TSH) as clinically indicated (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Hypothyroidism has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Panobinostat may prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT interval) (see SmPC section 5.3). The risk of 
QTc prolongation does not increase over time. QTcF should be <480 msec prior to initiation of treatment with 
Farydak. Appropriate monitoring of electrolytes (e.g. potassium, magnesium and phosphorus) and ECG should 
be performed at baseline and periodically during treatment, particularly in patients with severe gastrointestinal 
adverse drug reaction. Farydak should be used with caution in patients who already have or who are at 
significant risk of developing QTc prolongation. This includes patients: with long QT syndrome and with 
uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia (see smPC section 4.2).  
Concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, 
disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other substances that are known to prolong the QT 
interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin, 
bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a known risk of QT 
prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron and tropisetron should be used with caution (see 
SmPC section 4.5). QTc Prolongation has been classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan and 
ischemic heart disease and tachyarrhythmias have been classified as potential risks. 
Assessment report

Data about use in patients with cardiac diseases is missing. These have been adequately reflected in the SmPC 
(see section 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.3) and are reflected in the Risk Management Plan.  
At this point the risk of second primary malignancies raises no concern. However, based on the non-clinical 
observations where it is concluded that panobinostat is mutagenic and hence have carcinogenic potential, it is 
concluded  that the risk of second primary malignancies may be subject to close monitoring and has been 
classified as potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Plasma exposure of panobinostat is not altered in cancer patients with mild to severe renal impairment. 
Therefore, starting dose adjustments are not necessary. Panobinostat has not been studied in patients with end 
stage renal disease (ESRD) or patients on dialysis (see SmPC section 4.2). There seems to be a trend towards 
higher risk of AEs, including important AEs such as thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, vomiting and atrial fibrillation 
in patients with impaired renal function defined as creatinine clearance <90 mL/min at baseline. Frequencies of 
AEs with increasing degree of renal impairment are confounded by the fact that renal function also decreases 
with increasing age which has been shown to correlate with a disimprovement in the safety profile. It can also 
be expected that there may be some degree of renal impairment with more severe disease which may lead to a 
higher rate of reporting of some AEs. However, the age range per category of renal function is very wide and 
furthermore, it is not clear if the increasing frequency of AE with age is related to increasing renal impairment 
or vice versa. The risk of renal dysfunction has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan 
and a non-interventional study of panobinostat use in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients 
observational study is planning to address this safety issue. 
Colitis is included as ADR in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Patients should be advised to contact their physician if 
severe gastrointestinal toxicity occurs and dose adjustment or discontinuation may be required. Ischaemic 
colitis has been classified as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Currently available data do not support inclusion of venous thromboembolism in the SmPC. The risk of venous 
thromboembolism has been classified as potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Limited experience with overdose has been reported during clinical studies. Adverse reactions observed were 
consistent with the safety profile, with events primarily involving haematological and gastrointestinal disorders 
such as thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Cardiac monitoring and 
assessment of electrolytes and platelet counts should be undertaken and supportive care given as necessary in 
the event of overdose. It is not known whether panobinostat is dialysable (see SmPC section 4.9). 
An additional risk minimisation measure (educational material with the compliance card provided for the 
patients) has been introduced to help minimise the potential for medication errors based on the complicated 
posology regimen which had been classified as potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. The Applicant will 
continue to monitor the below safety concerns in a non-interventional observational study (LBH589D2408A) of 
panobinostat use in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients (in the real world setting): severe 
haemorrhage, severe infections (including sepsis and pneumonia), severe diarrhoea, use in elderly patients 
(aged 65 years or above), ischaemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism, carcinogenicity/ second primary 
malignancy, medication errors, use in patients with hepatic impairment and  use in patients with renal 
impairment. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile is dominated by the (S)AEs of diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage, neutropenia and 
infections. There was a transient decrease in QoL in the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients as compared to those 
in the control arm in TP1 during treatment. However, the deterioration in QoL during treatment was transient 
and expected in view of the toxicity profile.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Beneficial effects 
The study pivotal to this application, CLBH589D2308, was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with 
relapsed multiple myeloma. To qualify, patients needed to have received at least one prior line of therapy. 
In the full population of this study, the investigator-based PFS (primary endpoint) was 12 months for the 
experimental arm and 8 months for the control arm, thus an improvement in PFS of 4 months (HR: 0.63  (95% 
CI: 0.52, 0.76). The median OS (key secondary endpoint in the pivotal study) in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm, as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/496296/2015 
Page 118/124 
 
  
  
determined by the second interim analysis, is 38 months and 35 months, in the PAN+BTZ+Dex and 
PBO+BTZ+Dex arms, respectively (HR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.07; p=0.18). 
Due to the less favourable safety profile, a group of patients with limited treatment options was retrospectively 
identified, in which  panabinostat was considered to have a positive benefit risk (see below). 
In the subgroup of patients who had received at least two prior regimens including BTZ and IMiD the median PFS 
(investigator based) was prolonged by 7.8 months in patients receiving PAN+BTZ+Dex treatment as compared 
to the PBO+BTZ+Dex control arm, with a 52% relative risk reduction in the hazard rate of progression/death  
(HR: 0.48; 95% CI [0.31, 0.72], log-rank p value = 0.0003) which is considered to be of clinical significance. 
The median OS was 26.1 months in the PAN+BTZ+DEX treated patients vs 19.5 months in PBO+BTZ+DEX 
treated patients (HR 0.84 (95% CI 0.55; 1.27).

dexamethasone arm vs 39% in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm) and nCR (14% in the 
panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm vs 8% in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm) 
supported the primary efficacy endpoint and favored the panobinostat arm.  
The superior treatment effect of the experimental arm was consistent across performed sensitivity analyses, 
strata (prior lines of therapy 1 vs 2 or 3; previous exposure to bortezomib, yes/no), and most subgroups. Thus 
available data do not indicate that there is a loss of efficacy in patients with limited treatment options. 
Results from the supportive DUS71 Study, that included BTZ-refractory patients (excluded from the main study) 
showed that the ORR (i.e. a response more than a PR) was 35%. This is higher as compared to the 22% ORR to 
the last prior treatment before study entry. In the high-risk cytogenetic subgroup (del[17p], t[4;14], t[14;16]), 
ORR was 43%. For the total population, median OS was 17.5 months, the median PFS and TTP were both 5.4 
months, and the median DoR was 6.0 months. Therefore, these results from DUS71 showed a similar 
anti-tumour activity as in the pivotal trial and compared well to historical data. 
Overall, the efficacy results from the Phase Ib and the Phase II study are considered supportive for the pivotal 
study.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Due to long survival post progression and subsequent therapy the treatment benefit in terms of HR for survival 
is diluted. The MAH will submit the results of the final OS analysis post approval, but the results are expected to 
be stable. Thus, a precise estimate of effects on survival cannot be expected. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently occurring AEs in PAN + BTZ + DEX treated patients in study D2308, were 
thrombocytopenia (any grade 97.6%; Grade 3/4, 67.6%), neutropenia (any grade 75.0%; Grade 3/4, 34.5%), 
anaemia (any grade 62.0%; Grade 3/4, 17.7%), infections and infestations (69.8%),(mostly due to AEs of 
upper respiratory tract infections (20.0%) and pneumonia (16.4%)), fatigue (45.5%), peripheral oedema 
(29.9%) and pyrexia (25.9%), peripheral neuropathy (30.8%), hypokalemia (27.1%).  
In the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm, the rate of haemorrhages was approximately twice that of the rate in the PBO + 
BTZ + DEX arm at 20.7% vs 11.7% for any grade haemorrhages and 4.2% vs. 2.4% for Grade 3/4 
haemorrhages.

Page 119/124 
  
  
Diarrhoea was also more frequent in patients treated with PAN + BTZ + DEX compared to those treated with 
PBO + BTZ + DEX (68% vs 41.6%), with Grade 3/4 severity being three times more frequent in the 
experimental arm (25.5% vs 8.0%). 
The safety profile also included qualitative ECG abnormalities, such as T-wave changes and ST-T segment 
depression (63.5% of patients in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs 42.2% in the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm) and sinus 
tachycardia (15.5% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm vs 6.8% in PBO +BTZ + DEX). The great majority of patients 
with ECG abnormalities did not experience a cardiac event subsequent to an ECG abnormality. 
A high proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to an AE in the experimental arm compared to the 
control arm (36 % vs 20 %).  More patients in the experimental arm were in need of study drug interruption or 
dose adjustment (89 %) compared to the control arm (76 %).  The rate of death on-treatment, but not due to 
the study indication of MM, was twice as high in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm (6.8%) compared to the PBO + BTZ 
+ DEX arm (3.2%). The rate of on-treatment deaths due to the disease was 1.0% in the PAN + BTZ + DEX arm 
compared to 1.6% the PBO + BTZ + DEX arm which is expected given the disease and stage.  
The QoL in the PAN + BTX + DEX arm decreased to a higher extent than in the control arm, crossing the 
threshold of the minimal important difference. However, the deterioration in QoL during treatment was transient 
and expected in view of the toxicity profile. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Due to the limited safety database, a number of uncertainties were identified during the assessment, including, 
use in elderly patients (aged 65 years or above) patients with ischemic heart disease. hepatic impairment and 
renal impairment which were satisfactorily addressed (see discussion on clinical safety) and have been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC and in the Risk Management Plan.. In addition, the Applicant will continue to 
monitor the above safety concerns in a non-interventional observational study of panobinostat use in relapsed 
and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients LBH589D2408 (see Risk Management Plan). 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The relative PFS benefit of 4 months in the overall group of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma following 
at least one prior therapy receiving PAN+BTZ+Dex treatment as compared to the PBO+BTZ+Dex control arm is 
considered clinically relevant. This benefit was further extended to almost 8 months in the retrospectively 
established subgroup of patients who had received at least two prior regimens including BTZ and IMiD. No 
significant effect on the key overall survival was observed but this should be considered in the context of the 
long survival post progression and subsequent therapy. Overall, the effect on the secondary endpoints is 
consistent between subgroups and similar across various sensitivity analyses.  
The limiting factor in the use of panobinostat is its toxicity. The safety profile is dominated by the (S)AEs of 
diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage, neutropenia and infections with a high proportion of patients 
discontinuing treatment due to an AE in the experimental arm and an increased rate of deaths on-treatment. 
ECG abnormalities have been observed but their implications are unclear. There was a transient decrease in QoL 
in the PAN + BTZ + DEX-treated patients as compared to those in the control arm in TP1 during treatment.

Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of panobinostat for the broad indication of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma 
following at least one prior therapy has been questioned due to the severity of the toxicity and alternative 
treatment options. For this reason it is considered that panobinostat is not indicated for patients that may still 
accrue a benefit from either BTZ or IMiD based therapy. Thus, the benefit-risk balance for panobinostat is 
considered to be only positive in the subgroup of adult patients with relapsed and /or refractory multiple 
myeloma who have received at least two prior regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.  
In these patients there is still an unmet medical need with a benefit of panobinostat that outweighs its toxicity, 
as will be discussed further below. 
Bortezomib refractory patients were excluded from D2308, but the supportive evidence from DUS71 provides 
the evidence needed not to exclude these patients from the labelling. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
There are still uncertainties on the optimal dose. The impact of adverse events may be lessened by close 
monitoring and timely interventions and the SmPC contains recommendations for patient monitoring and for 
dose modifications, interruption or discontinuation in case of adverse events. Recommendations also include 
platelet transfusion in case of thrombocytopenia, administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor 
therapy in case of neutropenia, according to local medical practice and treatment guidelines, and/or in the event 
of severe secondary infections and use of anti-diarrhoeal agents. 
For patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM, treatment strategy is complex depending on the type of prior 
treatments, response to prior therapy, treatment tolerability, and patient characteristics and there is no 
standard recommended therapy. Previous treatments may be retried depending on the response to that 
treatment, second autologous stem cell transplantation depending on the response to the first SCT and on 
patient eligibility (or even a first SCT) may be an option for some patients. One of the current approaches in the 
treatment of relapsed and/or refractory MM is to change to an agent from a different class. The availability of a 
therapy with a different mechanism of action would provide another option to be used in this approach. Patients 
refractory to both an IMiD and bortezomib have a poorer prognosis and limited further treatment options. 
Overall, the efficacy of PAN+BTZ+DEX is considered to be of clinical significance in the perspective of current 
treatment strategies and to outweigh the risk associated with therapy, in such patients. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Farydak is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Revlimid and 
Imnovid within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Farydak, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed and /or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two

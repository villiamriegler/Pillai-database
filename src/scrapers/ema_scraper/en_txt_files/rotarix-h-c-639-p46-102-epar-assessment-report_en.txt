Assessor comments 
Two formulations of the Rotarix vaccine (liquid PCV-free and lyophilized) are administered in this study.  
The HRV liquid formulation is administered as a 1.5 ml oral dose while the HRV lyophilized formulation 
is administered as a 1 ml oral dose. For each formulation, two doses of the vaccine were given.   
In EU, both a liquid and lyophilized formulation of the Rotarix vaccine are approved for use in infants 
from  6  to  24  weeks  to  protect  against  gastroenteritis  (diarrhoea  and  vomiting)  caused  by  rotavirus

infections. However, the HRV liquid formulation used in the ROTA-096 study is PCV free (no detection of 
PCV-1 and PCV-2 according to the limit of detection of the test used).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
study ROTA-096 entitled ‘ A phase III, observer-blind, randomized, multi-country study to assess 
the reactogenicity and safety of the Porcine circovirus (PCV) free liquid formulation of GSK’s oral 
live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine as compared to the lyophilized formulation of the 
GSK’s HRV vaccine, when administered as a 2-dose vaccination in infants starting at age 6-12 
weeks.’ 
Rotarix  is  a  live  attenuated  HRV  vaccine  (strain  G1P[8],  RIX4414)  for  oral  administration  that  is 
manufactured  by  GlaxoSmithKline  Biologicals  SA  (referred  to  as  GSK).  Two  pharmaceutical  forms  of 
Rotarix are available: the lyophilized formulation to be reconstituted with a liquid diluent and the liquid 
formulation  ready  to  use.  The  active  ingredient  (rotavirus  strain  RIX4414)  is  the  same  for  both 
formulations;  only  the  excipients  differ,  which  is  linked  to  manufacturing  and  vaccine  stability 
constraints.  The lyophilized formulation  was approved  in  the European Union (EU)  via  the centralized 
procedure  on  21  February  2006  and  the  liquid  formulation  was  approved  as  a  line  extension  on  1 
September 2008. the Rotarix liquid formulation is prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
The current indication in the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) is active immunization of 
infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection. 
The  ROTA-096  study  report  is  being  submitted  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Article  46  of  the 
pediatric regulation 1901/2006. 
Study ROTA-096 has not been conducted in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan. 
On 15-16 March 2010, GSK informed the Health Authorities worldwide (including the European Medicines 
Agency [EMA], WHO, and the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) of the unexpected 
presence  of  a  non-pathogenic  viral  strain  of  porcine  circovirus  type  1  (PCV-1)  deoxyribonucleic  acid 
(DNA) in its Rotarix vaccine. Further investigations confirmed the presence of PCV-1 DNA fragments in 
Rotarix and in its starting materials as well as low levels of PCV-1 viral particles during the production 
process and in the final container. 
EMA initiated an Art 20 procedure (EMEA/H/C/639/A-20/0024) and concluded that: 
1.  The benefit outweighed the risk in the authorized therapeutic indication of Rotarix, 
2.  A PCV-1 free vaccine should be developed, and 
3.  The marketing authorisation for Rotarix should contain information regarding the development 
of  a  PCV-1  free  vaccine  and  therefore  recommended  the  amendment  of  Annex  II  of  the  EU

2.3.2.  Clinical study ROTA-096  
2.3.2.1.  Description 
2.3.2.2.  Methods 
2.3.2.2.1.  Objective(s) 
Assessor comments 
This trial has two primary safety objectives. There are no immunogenicity or efficacy objectives in this 
trial.  
The first primary objective is to assess solicited AEs during the 8-day (Day 1 – Day 8) follow-up period 
after dose 1 and dose 2 of the HRV liquid PCV free and HRV lyophilized vaccines.  
The second primary objective is to assess unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Day 1 – Day 31) follow-up 
period after each vaccination and SAEs during the entire study period, meaning up to 6 months after the 
last dose.  
The follow up period for solicited/unsolicited AEs and SAEs are in line with previous HRV vaccine trials. 
Overall, the objectives and endpoints are considered appropriate.  
The  HRV  lyophilized  vaccine  is  used  as  a  control  in  this  study  because  the  liquid  formulation  is  not 
licensed  in  the  US.  Therefore,  the  company  used  the  lyophilized  vaccine  as  a  control  in  all  phase  III 
studies as part of the PCV-free development program. This is  considered acceptable as a comparable 
safety profile of both formulations was shown in clinical trials with approximately 1900 infants. 
2.3.2.2.2.  Study design 
Two oral doses of the study vaccines were administered at 1-month or 2-months interval to subjects, 
according to the immunization schedule for RV vaccine administration in participating countries. 
Due to the difference in the appearance and volume between lyophilized HRV vaccine and PCV-free liquid 
HRV vaccine, the study was observer-blinded. 
The total duration of the study, per subject, was approximately 7-8 months including the 6 months of 
extended safety follow-up (ESFU) period after the last dose of HRV vaccine.

Assessor comments 
The study ROTA-096 is a Phase III, observer-blind, randomized (1:1), controlled, multi-country study 
with 2 parallel groups: HRV liquid PCV-free and HRV lyophilized.  
The study is observer-blind because double blinding was not possible due to a difference in appearance 
and volume of the HRV liquid (1.5 ml, clear and colourless liquid) and HRV lyophilized (1.0 ml, turbid 
liquid after reconstitution) formulation. This approach is acceptable. 
Each  subject  received  2  doses  of  the  vaccine  with  an  interval  of  1  to  2  months.  The  first  dose  was 
administered  at  an  age  between  6  and  12  weeks.  Although  Rotarix  is  indicated  for  immunization  of 
infants from 6 to 24 weeks, a lower age limit is preferred as it is known that the first infection with a 
rotavirus is more severe than the subsequent infections  which  can be either  mild or asymptomatic. 
Therefore, it is most  important  to  prevent  the  first  rotavirus  infection in  infants.

Assessor Comments 
The study targets to enrol 1350 subjects, 675 subjects per group.  
The main criteria for inclusion are male or female infants of 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of first 
vaccination.  
Criteria  for  exclusion  from  participation  in  the  trial  are  several  medical  conditions  related  to 
immunological conditions or intussusception, which is a known risk associated with rotavirus vaccination. 
In addition, prematurely born infants ( born =<28 weeks of gestation) could not participate. No weight 
limit was applied to qualify for participation.  
Concomitant  use  of  another  vaccine  was  not  allowed  from  30  days  before  until  30  days  after  study 
vaccination.  However,  an  exception  are  inactivation  influenza  vaccine  and  other  licensed  routine 
childhood vaccines, which can all be administered without restriction. Clinical studies have shown that 
the immune response and the safety profiles of routine childhood vaccines are unaffected when given 
concomitantly with Rotarix. Only concomitant administration of an oral polio vaccine may slightly reduce 
the immune response of Rotarix. Clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was shown 
to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 4,200 subjects who received Rotarix concomitantly 
with OPV. 
2.3.2.2.4.  Treatments 
The doses used in this study were based on previous preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrated 
acceptable toxicological, safety and immunogenicity profiles.

Analysis of Demographics and baseline characteristics 
The median, mean, range and standard deviation of age (in weeks) at each study vaccine dose and of 
the gestational age at birth was computed by study group. The median, mean and standard deviation of 
length  (in  centimetres)  and  weight  (in  kilograms)  at  Visit  1  will  be  computed  by  study  group.  The 
distribution of racial and sex composition of the study population will be presented.  
Analysis of safety and reactogenicity 
The primary safety analysis will be performed on the Exposed set. 
The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting at least 1 AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 8 
day (Day 1-Day 8) solicited follow-up period post-vaccination was computed, along with exact 95% CI. 
The same calculations were done for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity, those 
assessed as causally related to vaccination, those rated as grade 3 in intensity with causal relationship 
to vaccination and those that resulted in a medically attended visit. 
The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting each individual solicited general AE was computed, 
over the 8-day (Day 1-Day 8) solicited follow-up period post- vaccination, along with exact 95% CI. The 
same calculations were done for each individual general solicited AE rated as grade 3 in intensity, those 
assessed as causally related to vaccination, those rated as grade 3 in intensity with causal relationship 
to vaccination and those that resulted in a medically attended visit. For fever, additional analyses will be 
performed by 0.5°C increments. These calculations were also performed by country, sex and frequent 
race. 
The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and symptoms were 
coded according to MedDRA. Every verbatim term were matched with the appropriate preferred term. 
The percentage of subjects with unsolicited AEs occurring within 31-day (Day 1-Day 31) follow-up period 
after any dose with its exact 95% CI were tabulated by group, and by preferred term. Similar tabulation 
was done for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3, for unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination, 
for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3 with causal relationship to vaccination and those that resulted in a 
medically attended visit. These calculations were also performed by country. 
For each study group, the percentage of subjects who started taking at least 1 concomitant medication, 
antipyretic medication and prophylactic antipyretic medication during the 8-day (Day 1 Day 8) and 31-
day (Day 1-Day 31) follow-up periods post-vaccination was tabulated by dose, by subject for each dose 
and across the 2 doses. 
Subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE during the entire study period (from Dose 1 till ESFU contact 
at Month 7-8) were summarised by study group and all SAEs were tabulated. 
Assessor Comments 
The exposed set (ES) consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of a study vaccine. All safety 
analyses are based on the exposed set.  
The proposed analysis methods for reactogenicity and safety are considered appropriate. 
2.3.2.3.  Results 
2.3.2.3.1.  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study enrolled 1351 subjects, all of which were vaccinated and included in the exposed set (ES), 
and of which 1310 subjects completed the study (Table 2).

None of the withdrawals was due to COVID-19. 
One subject in the HRV Liq group was withdrawn due to an unsolicited non-serious AE (Hematochezia) 
assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccine.

Assessor Comments 
In total 1351 subjects were enrolled in the study, 677 in the HRV liquid PCV-free group and 674 in the 
HRV lyophilized group, which approximately meets the enrolment target of 675 subjects per group. All 
subjects enrolled in the trial were vaccinated and included in the ES. The study was completed by the 
majority  of  the subjects  enrolled (653  subjects in the  HRV Liquid group  and 657 subjects  in  the HRV 
Lyophilized group). One subject in the HRV liquid group was withdrawn due to a non-serious adverse 
event  of  Hematochezia  which  the  investigator  considered  related  to  the  vaccine  (further  discussed  in 
Section  2.3.2.3.4.  Safety  results  –  unsolicited  adverse  events).  The  most  common  reason  for  not 
completing  the  study  was  due  to  consent  withdrawal,  not  due  to  an  AE  (N=25  subjects)  and  lost  to 
follow-up (N=10 subjects).   
2.3.2.3.2.  Baseline data 
The mean age of subjects was 9.0 ± 1.5 weeks at Dose 1 of HRV vaccine; 51.3% of the subjects were 
female. White (50.7%) was the predominant race followed by Asian (44.6%) (Table 3). 
Among all subjects of the exposed set (ES), 26.9% were enrolled in Hong Kong, 20.4% in Turkey, 19.1% 
in the US, 17.7% in Canada and 15.9% in Taiwan. 
The demographic characteristics were comparable across the groups in each country.

Assessor Comments 
Overall, the baseline characteristics are well balanced between both groups. 
The  mean  and  median  age  at  dose  1  of  the  HRV  vaccine  was  9.0  weeks  in  both  groups.  The  youngest 
participant was 5 weeks old in the HRV lyophilized group and 6 weeks in the HRV liquid group. In both 
groups the maximum age was 13 weeks at the first dose. The median age at the second dose was 17.0 
weeks in both groups, ranging from 10 to 23 weeks in the HRV liquid group and from 10 to 29 weeks in the 
HRV lyophilized group. As Rotarix was administered at young age, it is expected that most subjects have 
not been infected yet with rotavirus before. The majority of the subjects in the ROTA-096 study received 
Rotarix according to the EU label, meaning at an age of 6 to 24 weeks old. 
The median gestational age of participants in the trial was 39 weeks, with a minimum of 30 weeks.

Overall the number of females and males is well balanced (693 vs. 658, respectively). While in the HRV 
liquid group the gender distribution is almost equal (49.6% females and 50.4% males), there are slightly 
more females in the HRV lyophilized group compared to males (53.0% vs. 47.0%, respectively).  
The majority of the subjects originate from Hong Kong (26.9%), followed by Turkey (20.4%), United States 
(19.1%), Canada (17.7%) and Taiwan (15.9%). The race of most participants was White (50.7%) or Asian 
(44.6%) and similar in both groups.  
Co-administration (= on the same day) or concomitant administration (=on any other day in the trial) of 
routine childhood vaccines was allowed in the ROTA-096 trial and not expected to impact the safety data. 
In total, co-administration occurred in 43.7% of subjects at Dose 1 and 43.0% of subjects at Dose 2. Most 
frequently co-administered vaccines were Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine (43.1% with Dose 1, 39.3% 
with Dose 2), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (40.6% with Dose 1, 42.4% with Dose 2), diphtheria-
tetanus-pertussis  vaccine  (40.5%  with  Dose  1,  42.3%  with  Dose  2)  and  inactivated  poliovirus  vaccine 
(40.5% with Dose 1 and 42.3% with Dose 2). A concomitant vaccine was administered  to  39.2% of the 
subjects between Dose 1 and 2 and to 50.8% of the subjects between Dose 2 and the visit at Month 2-4.

Adverse events 
During the 8 days (Day 1 - Day 8) following HRV vaccination, at least 1 solicited or unsolicited AE was 
reported in 85.2% and 82.5% of the subjects in the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively (Table 
4). In both the vaccine groups, the incidence of the solicited or unsolicited AEs (grade 3, causally related, 
grade 3 causally related and AEs leading to medically attended visits) was comparable.

Solicited AEs collected during the 8-day post-vaccination period are Cough/Runny nose; Diarrhea; Fever; 
Irritability/Fussiness; Loss of appetite and Vomiting.  
Similar percentages of subjects reported solicited AEs after administration of the HRV Liquid PCV-free or 
HRV  Lyophilized  formulation  (overall/subject).  The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  AEs  are 
irritability/Fussiness  (74.9%  and  72.1%,  respectively  in  the  HRV  Liquid  and  HRV  Lyophilized  group), 
followed by  Loss of  appetite (42.8% vs.  38.4%, respectively), cough/Runny  nose (35.0%  vs. 34.9%, 
respectively), vomiting (22.3% vs. 24.0%) and Diarrhea (8.6% vs. 10.5%). Fever was only solicited AE 
reported by less than 10% of the subject and was mainly mild.   
The  frequency  of  solicited  AEs  reported  after  the  first  and  second  dose  is  similar.  Only  for 
Irritability/Fussiness, the frequency is slightly lower after the second dose in both the HRV Liquid PCV-
free (Dose 1: 63.7% (95% CI: 59.9-67.3) vs. Dose 2: 55.5% (95% CI: 51.6-59.3)) and HRV Lyophilized 
group (Dose 1: 63.5% (95% CI: 59.7-67.1) vs. Dose 2: 55.1% (95% CI: 51.2-58.9)). 
The most commonly reported Grade  3 solicited AEs were Irritability/Fussiness (9.7% vs. 7.1% in  the 
HRV Liquid and HRV lyophilized group, respectively) and Vomiting (6.1% vs. 5.8%, respectively). For all 
other  solicited  AEs,  Grade  3  events  were  reported  for  less  than  1.5%  of  the  subjects.  No  significant 
differences  in  frequency  of  Grade  3  events  are  observed  between  both  groups,  or  between  first  and 
second dose. 
Clinical investigators considered approximately 70% of all events of Diarrhea, Irritability/Fussiness, Loss 
of  Appetite  and  Vomiting  related  to  the  study  vaccine.  Relatedness  was  a  bit  lower  for  Cough/Runny

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Nose (approximately 40%) and none of the fever episodes were considered related. Overall, relatedness 
was well balanced between the HRV liquid and HRV lyophilized group and after the first and second dose. 
Medically attended solicited AEs were reported for ≤1% of the subjects, except for Cough/Runny nose 
(3.0% vs. 2.7% in the HRV Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively) and Vomiting in the HRV 
Liquid group (1.3%).  
In  the  current  SmPC,  only  diarrhea  and  irritability  are  considered  common  AEs  possibly  related  to 
vaccination.  The  severity  of  all  solicited  AEs  was  not  found  to  be  significantly  different  in  the  group 
receiving  Rotarix  compared  to  placebo,  in  3  placebo-controlled  trials.  In  addition,  there  was  also  no 
difference in incidence or severity after the first or second dose.  
To  conclude,  no  meaningful  differences  are  observed  in  the  frequency  of  solicited  adverse  events 
between the HRV Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group.

Assessor Comments 
During  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period,  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  29.7%  and  30.6%  of 
subjects in the HRV Liquid group and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively.  
Unsolicited AEs considered causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported in 2.5% and 
4.5%  of  subjects  in  the  HRV  Liquid  group  and  HRV  Lyophilized  group,  respectively.  Most  frequently 
reported was constipation in the HRV Liquid group (4 subjects, vs. 0 subjects in HRV Lyophilized) and 
somnolence in the HRV Lyophilized group (5 subjects, vs. 1 subject in HRV Liquid). The incidence rates 
of constipation and somnolence observed in Rota-096 are line with the observations in two other studies 
where  subjects  were  vaccinated  with  HRV  Liquid    and  HRV  Lyophilized    (Rota-081  and  Rota-090).  In 
addition, it is acknowledged that sleep disorders and constipation are common and not unexpected in 
infants (Rajindrajith S et al.;  Mindell JA et al.). In the HRV Liquid group, one subject was diagnosed with 
Hematochezia.  This  non-serious  adverse  event  was  assessed  as  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the 
clinical  investigator.  The  subject’s  parents/legally  acceptable  representatives  decided  to  withdraw  the 
subject  from  the  study.  Hematochezia  is  a  known  adverse  reaction  with  unknown  frequency  after 
vaccination with Rotarix. However, the information provided for this AE is limited.  
At least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported by 1.2% (8 subjects) and 1.6% (11 subjects) of the 
subjects in both groups respectively. Each individual Medra PT was reported by only 2 subjects or less 
in each group. 
Grade 3 unsolicited AEs considered as causally related were reported for 2 subjects in the HRV Liquid 
group (including Abdominal Pain; Ill-defined disorder) and by 3 subjects in the HRV Lyophilized group 
(including abdominal discomfort; Bronchiolitis; Somnolence). Of note: intussusception is a known very 
rare adverse reaction associated with rotavirus vaccine.  
Medical attention following an unsolicited AE was needed for 16.1% of the subjects in the HRV Liquid 
group and for 20.3% of the subjects in the HRV Lyophilized group. Upper respiratory tract infection was 
the most commonly reported unsolicited AE requiring medical attention in both groups (3.0% and 4.7% 
of the subjects in HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively). These frequencies are overall in line with 
the  observations  in  the  Rota-081  study  (6.5%  and  6.2%  in  HRV  Liquid  vs  HRV  Lyophilized  group, 
respectively) and Rota-090 study (9.0% and 9.5% in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively). 
Although it is known that upper respiratory tract infections are common in young children (Cinaroglu, S 
; Weintraub B.), there is no data on the incidence of medically attended upper respiratory tract infection 
in the general population to compare with.  
No  meaningful  differences  were  observed  between  countries  in  the  frequency  and  type  of  unsolicited 
AEs. 
It is unclear which adverse events occurred after the first or the second dose of the HRV vaccine as this 
is not discussed in the CSR. 
Overall, unsolicited AEs, including Grade 3, medically attended and causally related AEs, are comparable 
after administration of the HRV Liquid or HRV Lyophilized formulation.

Deaths and Serious Adverse Events 
There was no death reported in this study. 
SAEs were collected during the entire study period.  
•  A total of 62 SAEs were reported in 39 subjects in the HRV Liq group (5.8% of subjects) and 59 
SAEs were reported in 38 subjects in the HRV Lyo group (5.6% of subjects) (Table 8). 
• 
In the HRV Liq group, 1 SAE (constipation) reported in 1 subject was assessed by the investigator 
as possibly causally related to the study vaccine.  
−  One subject developed constipation on Day 7 of the first dose of the HRV liquid 
vaccine administration. The event was reported as resolved within 14 days from 
the onset day.  
•  None of the SAEs in the HRV Lyo group were assessed by the investigator as related 
to the study vaccine (Table 8).

Assessor Comments 
At least one SAE was reported by 39 subjects (62 events) in the HRV Liquid group and by 38 subjects 
(59 events)  in  the HRV Lyophilized  group.  All  subjects with  an SAE  were hospitalized,  except  for  one 
subject with Exanthema Subitum. 
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (5  vs.  6  events  in  the  HRV 
Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively), Urinary tract infection (6 vs. 4, respectively), Eczema 
(6 vs. 2, respectively), Respiratory Syncytial Virus bronchiolitis (5 vs. 2, respectively) and gastroenteritis 
(2 vs. 5, respectively).  
One SAE of constipation was considered as possibly related to the vaccine in the HRV Liquid group. A 8- 
weeks old male infant developed mild constipation 6 days after the first vaccination and was hospitalized 
due to no bowel output for 4 days and reduced oral intake. An abdominal X-ray was performed 3 days 
after  onset  and  revealed  no  dilated  bowels.  The  event  resolved  after  14  days.  The  subject  had  no 
symptoms after the second dose of the vaccine.  
None  of  the  SAEs  in  the  HRV  Lyophilized  group  were  considered  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the 
clinical investigator. 
Intussusception, a known very rare adverse reaction associated with rotavirus vaccines was not reported 
in this trial. 
The majority of the SAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and 14 SAEs were severe. 
No deaths were reported in this trial.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  the  phase  III  randomized  Rotarix  trial  ROTA-096,  the  safety  profile  of  a  HRV  Liquid  PCV-free 
formulation was compared with the HRV Lyophilized formulation in 675 infants per group (target sample 
size) of 6-12 weeks old at time of first vaccination. 
The  study  was  performed  in  Hong  Kong, Turkey, United  States, Canada  and  Taiwan.  The  race  of  most 
participants was White (50.7%) or Asian (44.6%) and baseline characteristics are well balanced between both groups. 
The number of subjects who reported at least one solicited or unsolicited AEs during the 8-day period 
following vaccination (overall/subject) was similar for the HRV Liquid group (85.2%) compared to the 
HRV Lyophilized group (82.5%). 
The most frequently reported solicited AEs during 8 days following vaccination are irritability/Fussiness 
(74.9%  and  72.1%,  respectively  in  the  HRV  liquid  and  HRV  Lyophilized  group),  followed  by  Loss  of 
appetite (42.8% vs. 38.4%, respectively), cough/Runny nose (35.0% vs. 34.9%, respectively). Grade 3 
events were reported for approximately 5-10% of Irritability/Fussiness and Vomiting events, while for 
all other solicited AEs Grade 3 events were reported for less than 1.5% of the subjects. In the current 
SmPC,  only  diarrhea  and  irritability  are  considered  common  AEs  possibly  related  to  vaccination.  The 
severity of the all solicited AEs was not found to be significantly different in the group receiving Rotarix 
compared to placebo, in 3 placebo-controlled trials. 
During  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period,  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  29.7%  and  30.6%  of 
subjects  in  the  HRV  Liquid  group  and  HRV  Lyophilized  group,  respectively.  Grade  3  unsolicited  AEs 
considered as causally related were reported for 2 subjects in the HRV Liquid group (including Abdominal 
Pain;  Ill-defined  disorder)  and  by  3  subjects  in  the  HRV  Lyophilized  group  (including  abdominal 
discomfort; Bronchiolitis; Somnolence). 
In  total  121  SAEs  were  reported  by  77  subjects.  One  SAE  of  constipation,  starting  6  days  after 
vaccination, was considered as possibly related to the HRV Liquid vaccine. The SAE was resolved after 
14 days.  Intussusception,  a known very  rare  adverse reaction  associated with rotavirus  vaccines was 
not reported in this trial. 
No deaths were reported in the trial. 
Overall, the reactogenicity and safety profile of the PCV-free liquid vaccine, was comparable to the HRV 
lyophilized vaccine  when administered as a 2-dose vaccination. No safety concerns were raised and the 
data are in line with the current version of the SmPC.   
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The  reactogenicity  and  safety  profile  of  the  HRV  Liquid  PCV-free  and  HRV  Lyophilized  formulation, 
administered  in  a 2-dose schedule,  is  comparable  in  infants of 6-12 weeks  of  age at the time of  first 
vaccination. No additional safety concerns have been identified. No update of the SmPC is needed.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following question as part of this procedure: 
1)  The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered causally related to vaccination by the 
investigator  were  constipation  in  the  HRV  Liquid  group  (4  subjects,  vs.  0  subjects  in  HRV 
Lyophilized)  and  somnolence  in  the  HRV  Lyophilized  group  (5  subjects,  vs.  1  subject  in  HRV

Liquid).  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was  the  most  commonly  reported  unsolicited  AE 
requiring medical attention in both groups (3.0% and 4.7% of the subjects in HRV Liq and HRV 
Lyo groups, respectively). As these AEs are currently not listed as adverse reactions in the SmPC, 
the MAH is required to discuss their incidence in the light of the observation made during previous 
clinical studies.  
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

Question 1 
Studies Rota-081  and  Rota-090 were  selected  for  this  discussion  since these  studies compare HRV 
PCV  free  Liquid  versus  HRV  Lyophilized  formulations  as  does  Rota-096.  The  age  groups  in  the  three 
studies are similar and the sample size of the analysis sets was comparable. 
•  Rota-081: A phase IIIA, randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical 
consistency of 3 production lots of the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK’s oral  live  attenuated  
HRV    vaccine    and    to    evaluate    the    PCV-free    liquid  formulation  of  GSK’s  HRV  vaccine  as 
compared  to  the  currently  licensed  lyophilised  formulation  of  the  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of 
immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when administered as a 2-dose vaccination in healthy 
infants starting at age 6-12 weeks. 
•  Rota-090:  A  phase  IIIA,  randomised,  single-blind,  multi-centric  study  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity,  reactogenicity and  safety  of  3  doses  of  Pediarix,  Hiberix  and Prevenar 13 
when  co-administered  with  2  doses  of  the  PCV-free  liquid  formulation  of  GSK’s    oral    live  
attenuated  HRV  vaccine  as  compared  to  the  currently  licensed lyophilised formulation of 
the HRV vaccine in healthy infants 6-12 weeks of age. 
In the Rota-096 study, causally related adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were collected up 
to 31 days following vaccination. In order to discuss the incidence of constipation and somnolence in the 
Rota-096 study, we used the tables presenting the percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited adverse 
events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term with causal relationship 
to vaccination, during the 31 days following HRV vaccination. 
In the Rota-096 study, medically attended AEFI were collected up to 31 days following vaccination. In 
order to discuss the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection in the Rota-096 study, we used the 
table presenting the percentage of subjects with unsolicited adverse events leading to medical attention 
classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the 31 days following HRV 
vaccination. 
Incidence of constipation and somnolence with causal relationship to vaccination in Rota-096 
and other clinical studies: 
A summary of the data from the different studies is presented in Table 9 and Table 10. 
Given  the  low  number  of  reported  constipation cases  in  the  studies,  data  should  be interpreted 
with caution. Based on the data presented in Table 9 and Table 10 no trend of increased incidence of 
constipation or somnolence with causal relationship to vaccination was observed in Rota-096 compared 
to Rota-081 and Rota-090.

Table 11. Summary table of percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of 
upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention within the 31-days 
post-vaccination period 
Conclusion 
Table 9, Table 10 and Table 11 show that the observed incidence of constipation and somnolence related 
to vaccination and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention in Rota-096 study is in 
line with the incidence observed in studies Rota-081 and Rota-090. 
Childhood  constipation  is  a  common  problem  worldwide.  Constipation  could  be  caused  by  underlying 
functional or organic causes. Because only a minority of patients suffering from constipation seek health 
care, it is difficult to capture the exact burden (Mugie SM et al). The prevalence of childhood constipation 
in the general population ranged from 0.7% to 29.6% in children from 0 to 18-year-old (Rajindrajith S 
et al.). 
Sleep  disorders  are  common  problems  for  children  and  adolescents,  with  estimates indicating that 
approximately  20%  to  25%  of  the  paediatric  population  experience  some  type  of  sleep  disturbance 
(Mindell JA et al.). Sleep patterns develop rapidly during the first few years of life and this development 
is a highly dynamic process. At birth, infants lack an established circadian rhythm and hence sleep across 
multiple  intervals  throughout  the  day  and  night  (Tham  EK.  et  al.).  Because  of  these  sleep  disorders, 
somnolence is not unexpected in the paediatric population. 
Respiratory  tract  infections  (RTI)  are  a  major  public  health  issue  in  both  developed  and  developing 
countries (Ge X et al.). In Turkey, one of the countries in which study Rota-096  was  conducted,  upper  
respiratory tract  infections  (URIs) were  the  most  common diseases in children aged 0–6 years with 
a prevalence of 41.9% (Cinaroglu, S). Children get two to eight URIs annually in the first 2 years after 
birth;  those  who  attend  day  care  may  have  as  many  as  14  annually  (Weintraub  B.).  URIs  are  more 
common in children compared to adults because their immune systems are still developing. Functional 
immune immaturity, anatomical immaturity of respiratory system, seasonality and frequent contact with 
the family members are the main causes of URIs.  
The  observed  incidence  of  constipation  and  somnolence  related  to  vaccination  and  upper  respiratory 
tract infection requiring medical attention in Rota-096 study is therefore in line with the prevalence in 
similar age group irrespective of Rotarix administration. 
Based  on  the  above  information  and  evaluation,  no  concern  is  raised  regarding  incidence  of  AEs  of 
constipation  and  somnolence  related  to  vaccination  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  requiring 
medical attention in Rota-096 study. 
Assessor Comments 
The MAH compared the incidence of constipation and somnolence with causal relationship to vaccination, 
and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention in the Rota-096 study with the incidence 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

in  two  other  studies,  Rota-081  and  Rota-090.  In  all  three  studies,  healthy  infants  of  6-12  weeks  old 
received  a  2-dose  vaccination  with  the  PCV-free  liquid  formulation  or  the  lyophilised  HRV  vaccine 
formulation.  
In  all  3  studies,  related  AEs  and  medically  attended  AEs  were  collected  up  to  31  days  following 
vaccination. 
For constipation, overall the number of cases reported in all 3 studies was low. Although taking this into 
consideration, there was a small imbalance in number of subjects reporting this related AE between the 
HRV liquid group (4 subjects out of 677) and the HRV Lyophilized group (0 subjects out of 674) in the 
Rota-096  study.  There  was  no  indication  for  a  difference  between  the  HRV  liquid  group  and  HRV 
Lyophilized group in the Rota-081 (2 subjects out of 1198 and 2 subjects out of 402 reported related 
constipation in both groups, respectively) and Rota-090 study (0 subjects out of 632 and 2 subjects out 
of  640  reported  related  constipation  in  both  groups,  respectively).  The  MAH  refers  to  a  publication 
describing that childhood constipation in the general population ranges from 0.7% to 29.6% in children 
0-18 yoa (Rajindrajith S et al.). 
The incidence of somnolence in the study Rota-096 was higher in the HRV Lyophilized group (5 subjects 
out of 674) compared to the HRV liquid group (1 subject out of 677). This data is in line with the Rota-
081 (3 subjects out of 1198 and 0 subjects out of 402 reported related constipation in HRV Liquid vs 
HRV Lyophilized group, respectively) and Rota-090 study (5 subjects out of 632 and 4 subjects out of 
640 reported related constipation in both groups, respectively), with the overall incidence being similar 
in  both  groups.  The  MAH  indicates  that  approximately  20%  to  25%  of  the  paediatric  population 
experience some type of sleep disturbance (Mindell JA et al.).  
Although not possible to compare incidence rates of constipation and somnolence within 31 days after 
vaccination in the Rota-studies, with the incidences reported in referred publications, it is acknowledged 
that  sleep  disorders  and  constipation  are  common  and  not  unexpected  in  infants.  We  agree  that  the 
incidences  of  constipation  and  somnolence  observed  in  Rota-096  are  line  with  the  observations  form 
Rota-081 and Rota-090.  
In the Rota-096 study, upper respiratory tract infection was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE 
requiring  medical  attention  in  both  groups  (3.0%  and  4.7%  of  the  subjects  in  HRV  Liquid  and  HRV 
Lyophilized  groups,  respectively).  However,  the  incidence  was  similar  or  even  higher  in  the  Rota-081 
study (6.5% and 6.2% in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively) and Rota-090 study (9.0% 
and 9.5% in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively). The MAH indicates that the prevalence 
of upper respiratory tract infections in 0-6 yoa children in Turkey (were 20.4% of subjects in Rota-096 
were enrolled) is 41.9% (Cinaroglu, S). In addition, Children get two to eight URIs annually in the first 
2 years after birth; those who attend day care may have as many as 14 annually (Weintraub B.).  
We acknowledge that upper respiratory tract infections are common in children, although the incidence 
of medically attended upper respiratory tract infection in the general population is unknown and the data 
of the Rota-studies cannot be compared with the incidences reported in the publications. The frequencies 
observed in Rota-096 are in line with the observations from Rota-081 and Rota-090.  
Based  on  the  data  provided,  we  can  conclude  that,  in  Rota-096,  the  incidence  of  constipation  and 
somnolence related to vaccination, and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention is in 
line with results from Rota-081 and Rota-090. Moreover, although the available data are very limited, 
the  observed  incidences  do  not  seem  to  be  higher  than  the  expected  incidences  in  similar  age  group 
irrespective of Rotarix administration.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a novel nucleotide prodrug. In human hepatocytes, SOF is converted to an 
active uridine triphosphate form (GS 461203), which acts as an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) non-structural (NS) 5B ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase. The proposed indication for 
SOF is for use in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis C (CHC) in adults. 
Hepatitis C virus and its treatment 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major European public health challenge, with a prevalence 
of 0.4-3.5% in different EU member states. It is the most common single cause of liver 
transplantation in the Union. However, in the absence of effective antiviral therapy, recurrence 
of HCV infection in the graft is near universal. Post-transplant recurrence is often aggressive, 
and for this reason, patients that undergo liver transplantation due to hepatitis C have a worse 
prognosis than patients that do so for other indications.  
HCV is divided into six major genotypes and numerous subtypes, which are based on 
phylogenetic relationship. Genotype 1 is the most common genotype in Europe, comprising 
approximately 70 % of infections. Genotype 3 is second most common, followed by genotype 2. 
Genotype 4 is predominant in Egypt, the nation in the world with the highest documented HCV 
prevalence. Genotypes 5 and -6 are uncommon in Europe and the US, but are more common in 
South Africa and South-East Asia, respectively (Simmonds et al, Hepatology 2005). HCV 
genotype does not clearly impact the rate of disease progression. Treatment response, 
however, differs between genotypes. 
The goal of antiviral therapy against HCV is to reach sustained virological response (SVR), 
which is traditionally defined as the absence of quantifiable virus in plasma at least 24 weeks 
after the end of therapy. However, most relapses occur within 4 weeks of treatment 
discontinuation, and a 98-99% concordance has been shown between absence of quantifiable 
virus 12 weeks after therapy, and SVR24 (Florian et al, AASLD 2011). Therefore the absence of 
measurable virus 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) is presently accepted by European 
and US regulators as the primary endpoint in clinical trials. Though occasional late relapses 
occur, in general the durability of SVR has been amply demonstrated (see e.g., Ng and Saab, 
Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011). 
Presently licensed treatment options for HCV all include peginterferon (PEG) and ribavirin 
(RBV). For the treatment of genotype 1 infection, the addition of either one of the NS 3/4A 
protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir, approved in 2011, is presently considered 
standard-of-care. In the registrational studies for these drugs, such triple therapy yielded SVR 
in the order of 65-80% of patients with 24-48 weeks of therapy. However, response rates are 
considerably lower, e.g., in patients with prior nonresponse to interferon-based therapy and/or 
with cirrhosis. For genotypes other than -1 there are no direct-acting antivirals (DAA) presently 
approved. Bi-therapy with PEG and RBV is indicated for 16-48 weeks depending on 
circumstances. Whereas such therapy may cure up to 80% of unselected patients, response 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 9/100 
 
  
  
rates in patients with a history of prior treatment failure are lower, and advanced liver disease 
negatively impacts the probability of SVR. 
Interferon-based therapies are associated with a plethora of potentially serious side effects that 
are important in limiting real life effectiveness. These include a risk of hepatic decompensation 
and septicaemia in patients with advanced liver disease, as well as bone marrow suppression. 
Also, there are psychiatric side effects such as depression, which considerably limits eligibility 
to treatment in the target population (see e.g., Bini et al, Am J Gastroenterol 2005). Of 
particular relevance for patients with very advanced liver disease, interferons are 
contraindicated in patients with hepatic decompensation; furthermore, according to the product 
information for PEG alfa-2a and -2b, the baseline platelet count should exceed 90,000 and 
100,000/µl, respectively.  
Consequently, there is a clear unmet medical need for simplified HCV-treatment regimens. New 
treatment options are especially crucial in patient populations where treatment with PEG is not 
possible or has limited efficacy, including those who have failed prior therapy or have advanced 
liver disease. 
Hepatitis C subpopulations 
CHMP guidance for drug development for hepatitis C categorises patients with hepatitis C 
according to three different aspects. The first distinction is virological, and is determined by 
viral genotype. The second distinction applies to treatment experience. The third distinction 
relates to clinical parameters. Patients will belong to one or another subpopulation in each of 
these respects, which makes the potential number of subpopulations very large. 
Viral genotypes 
As stated above, HCV is divided into six phylogenetically defined genotypes. Each genotype is 
divided into subtypes. Both of the peginterferons were registered based on trials including all 
genotypes. The representation of patients with genotypes 4-6 in the pivotal trials was very low. 
The addition of RBV generally increases PEG efficacy but RBV has no clinically relevant antiviral 
activity of its own. In studies of PEG+RBV, higher response rates were noted in genotypes 2 
and 3 compared to 1, whereas responses to PEG+RBV in genotype 4-6 appear to be 
somewhere in-between. 
Since PEG+RBV therapy has a very considerable side effects profile, there has been a strong 
impetus to shorten treatment duration and lowering doses, if possible without unduly reducing 
SVR rates. The NV15942 study (Hadziyannis et al, Ann Intern Med 2004) indicated that this 
was possible while retaining activity against genotypes 2 and 3. On this basis emerged the 
paradigm of 48 weeks of PEG+RBV therapy for genotypes 1 and 4, and 24 weeks of therapy for 
genotypes 2 and 3. With these treatment paradigms, roughly 40-50% of treatment-eligible 
genotype 1 patients are cured, versus 70-85% of treatment-eligible genotype 2/3 patients. The 
labelled indications for the peginterferons encompass all genotypes and all hepatitis C 
subpopulations except those with decompensated liver disease/hepatic impairment. The latter 
is due to the specific side effects profile of these agents, which makes treatment of such 
patients risky, as described above. 
These differences also prompted the notion that genotypes 1 and -2/3 ought to be investigated 
in separate trials. Responses of genotypes 2 and 3 to PEG+RBV have been considered similar. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 10/100 
 
  
  
However, responses are somewhat higher for genotype 2, as exemplified by the ACCELERATE 
study, in which SVR rates with 24 weeks of therapy was 75% for genotype 2 and 66% for 
genotype 3 (Shiffman et al, N Engl J Med 2007). 
Present CHMP draft guidance anticipates that the efficacy of an antiviral should be shown in 
sufficiently powered studies specifically against genotypes 1, -2 and -3, with SVR as an 
endpoint. Whether this is done under the same trial protocol with appropriate stratification and 
genotype representation, or in different trials, is in practice a matter of convenience, contingent 
on factors such as whether the treatment regimen and comparator regimen are the same for 
each genotype. For the less common genotypes, it is recognised that a fully powered, 
independent efficacy demonstration with SVR as an endpoint may not be feasible. Therefore, a 
totality of evidence approach is anticipated, where in vitro data, on-treatment virological 
responses as well as any SVR data available, should be shown to be sufficiently similar to 
available data in the more common genotypes, to allow for inferences based on bridging. A 
drug will be recommended for use against the spectrum of genotypes for which a positive 
benefit-risk balance has thus been substantiated. 
Treatment experience 
The second distinction pertains to treatment-naïve versus treatment-experienced. In this 
context, it should be noted that the latter term, if not further specified, tends to refer to 
experience of PEG+RBV (or some other use of interferon in the absence of a DAA). Indeed, no 
patients in the SOF Phase 3 trials were allowed to have experience of any other hepatitis C 
drugs apart from interferons and RBV – that is, no prior exposure to DAAs. Of note, a Bristol-
Myers-Squibb [BMS]-sponsored study (study AI444040) has included a study arm dedicated 
exclusively to patients with experience of failure on therapy with boceprevir- or telaprevir-
based triple therapy. Importantly, there is no cross-resistance between these agents and SOF. 
Insofar as the term “treatment-experienced” refers to patients that have been treated with 
PEG+RBV but have not been treated with a DAA, this population is in no way analogous to a 
“treatment-experienced” human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population. Whereas the virus of 
the latter have been subjected to selection pressure for antiviral resistance, and in many cases 
harbour virus with reduced susceptibility to one or more antivirals, PEG+RBV does not select 
for viral resistance (this being essentially an immune therapy). Consequently, it has been 
demonstrated that interferon responsiveness on retreatment with PEG+RBV is roughly similar 
to a first course (Liu et al, Clin Infect Dis 2012). Therefore, such a population is to be 
understood as functionally represented in a treatment-naïve population, since about 50% of a 
treatment naïve genotype 1 population and 20-30% of a treatment- naïve genotype 2/3 
population would be “treatment-experienced” without having been cured, if they had already 
been exposed to PEG+RBV. As available evidence indicates that, apart from the natural 
progression of the disease over time, nothing else would have changed, the lower response 
rates seen in PEG+RBV treatment-experienced population compared to a treatment naïve 
population is a consequence of selecting the most difficult-to-treat part of a treatment-naïve 
population and subjecting it to particular study. This circumstance allows for the bridging of 
data from the one population to the other. 
Regarding patients that have experience of non-curative treatment with a DAA there are a few 
notes to be made. First, while presently there are plenty of PEG+RBV-experienced patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 11/100 
 
  
  
there are at this time relatively few patients that have failed on DAA therapy. However, while 
the former will decrease in number, the latter will increase. Second, when considering 
retreatment, it must be evaluated whether the patient, subsequent to prior drug exposure, may 
harbour virus cross-resistant to any of the components in the new therapy. Third, if a patient 
has previously failed on a regimen that induces SVR in most patients, he/she is demonstrably 
difficult to cure from a “constitutional” perspective (presuming that lack of adherence was not 
the cause of failure). Such patients may require more potent and longer treatment regimens for 
cure than most others.  
These observations must be taken into account when evaluating trial protocols or making 
treatment decisions for such patients. Agents that are not cross-resistant to the agent the 
patient has been treated with retain their full activity in these patients, and should 
preferentially be used when treating such patients. Furthermore, the retreatment regimen must 
be more intense in terms of potency and/or duration of therapy than the prior failing regimen. 
Therefore, for such patients, an individualised approach to the selection of therapy, analogous 
to that used in patients with HIV, is anticipated. 
Clinically defined subpopulations 
The last set of distinctions made in the CHMP guidance pertains to clinically defined (adult) 
subpopulations, where patients may have any genotype, and may or may not have treatment 
experience. Apart from the general population of patients with chronic hepatitis C, the 
guidelines mention HIV/HCV co-infected patients, patients with decompensated liver disease, 
patients in the pre-transplant setting, and patients with recurrent HCV post-transplant. Though 
not discussed in CHMP guidelines, patients with acute HCV might be said to constitute a further 
such population. 
For all of these subpopulations, dedicated studies may be required to define the magnitude of 
benefits and of risks, which might differ from that in the “general population”. The approach 
toward such clinically defined subpopulations in terms of the formulation of the labelled 
indication (SmPC section 4.1) at approval, has historically been such, that if a general positive 
benefit-risk can be inferred on the basis of available data (usually consisting of efficacy and 
safety data from a “general population” with chronic hepatitis C and compensated liver disease, 
as well as drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies and special populations PK studies), the 
uncertainties concerning the more precise elements of the calculus and limitations of available 
data have been reflected in the product information, section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1, as relevant. 
Examples include the use of Incivo and Victrelis in the pre-and post-transplant setting, as well 
as the use of these drugs in HCV co-infection. The only case where the use of an agent in such 
a subpopulation has been explicitly contraindicated is in the case of decompensated liver 
disease, due to specific safety concerns with interferons accounted for above. 
On the evolution of the hepatitis C treatment paradigm 
Combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) was considered the 
standard of care for HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection until 2011, when the first DAAs 
(boceprevir and telaprevir) were approved. For the other HCV genotypes, the PEG-IFN plus 
ribavirin treatment regimen remains the standard of care. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 12/100 
 
  
  
Telaprevir and boceprevir were granted an indication in GT1-infected patients, in combination 
with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. At the time of the approval of these medicines in Europe, 
there were no large studies on-going with different combinations e.g. interferon-free regimens. 
Moreover, it had indeed only very recently been demonstrated for products in development that 
SVR could be reached without an interferon. Thus, the only drugs for which combination 
therapy could be relevant for these DAAs, were PEG+RBV, both of which were needed for 
reasonable efficacy.  
Presently, an entirely different landscape is emerging in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.  
DAAs of four distinct classes (NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, non-nucleoside and 
nucleos(t)ide inhibitors of the NS5B polymerase) are now in advanced stages of development. 
Developmental drugs of all of these classes have been studied in various combinations 
(including with and without PEG-IFN and ribavirin), with agents of each class having shown 
efficacy contributions when combined with the others.  
In this respect, the evolving treatment landscape for CHC now bears similarity to that in HIV, 
where the beneficial antiviral effect of combining agents that lack evidence of cross resistance 
is well established. Also, it is anticipated that regimen selection for patients with experience of 
failure on regimens containing DAA will be individualised based on an understanding of 
resistance and cross-resistance, like in the HIV field. In summary, the evolving field of hepatitis 
C therapeutics is similar to that of antiretroviral therapy in the following aspects: 
•  Combination therapy is anticipated in all cases 
•  Agents with different mechanisms of action or lack of cross-resistance consistently show 
additive antiviral effects 
• 
Failure of antiviral therapy is in many cases associated with selection of drug-resistant 
viral variants which may impact future therapeutic option. Furthermore, in hepatitis C, 
there are naturally occurring viral polymorphisms that impact the activity of some 
agents. 
•  Consequently, individual viral drug susceptibility will need to be taken into account when 
selecting an appropriate combination regimen 
Antiretrovirals used against HIV are generally approved for use “in combination with other 
agents”, with the particular information needed for rational regimen selection provided in 
relevant sections of the SmPC. The emerging treatment landscape indicates that the same 
approach would be appropriate for hepatitis C medicines in the light of the numerous 
combinations of medicinal products in this field. 
Thus, the CHMP considers that there is sufficient evidence to indicate the HCV medicines for 
use “in combination with other medicinal products”. The particular information for each 
compound, which is needed for rational regimen selection, should be provided in the relevant 
sections of the SmPC (i.e. mainly 4.2, 4.5, 5.1) as appropriate.

The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing 400 mg of Sofosbuvir as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)), croscarmellose 
sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica (E551), magnesium stearate (E470b), polyvinyl alcohol 
(E1203), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol (E1521), talc (E553b), and iron oxide yellow 
(E172).  
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a polypropylene 
child-resistant closure, silica gel desiccant and polyester coil. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of Sofosbuvir is (S)-isopropyl-2-((S)-(((2R,3R,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-
dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)-4-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methoxy)-
(phenoxy)phosphorylamino)propanoate and has the following structure: 
The structure of Sofosbuvir was unambiguously confirmed by 1H, 13C, 31P and 19F NMR, UV 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray 
crystallography. 
Sofosbuvir is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid, slightly soluble in water (pH 
1.2-7.7), freely soluble in ethanol and acetone, soluble in 2-propanol, and insoluble in heptane. 
Sofosbuvir is chiral and possesses 6 stereogenic centres which are well controlled by the 
synthetic process and the specifications of raw materials. The absolute and relative 
configuration of these chiral centres was established by single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
Eight polymorphic forms of Sofosbuvir have been observed and the manufacturing process 
consistently produces Sofosbuvir as the most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form, 
containing a small amount of a metastable form which were determined to be pharmaceutically 
equivalent as per ICH Q6A (decision tree #4). Other polymorphic forms are excluded by the 
manufacturing process and their absence is confirmed by DSC. 
The active substance is a chemical substance not previously authorised as a medicinal product 
in the European Union. Furthermore, it is not a salt, complex, derivative or isomer, (nor 
mixture of isomers), of a previously authorised substance. Sofosbuvir thus meets the definition 
of a New Active Substance according to the Notice to Applicants (NtA), Vol 2A, Chapter 1, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 14/100 
 
 
  
  
Annex 3 and a Marketing Authorisation Application in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC pertaining to a New Active Substance is justified. 
Manufacture 
Sofosbuvir is synthesized in four synthetic steps using three well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. GMP manufacturing for Sofosbuvir occurs at multiple manufacturers.  
The applicant’s original proposal for starting material definition was rejected by the CHMP. The 
applicant agreed to re-define as requested, with the caveat that implementation of GMP for one 
step would take until March 2014. The re-defined starting materials are considered appropriate 
to ensure the continued quality of the active substance throughout the product lifecycle. 
Adherence to GMP and the associated controls of manufacturing steps will help to prevent a 
drift in the impurity pattern of the active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Impurities present at higher than the 
qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies 
and appropriate specifications have been set based on the manufacturing experience to date. It 
is recommended that the applicant considers tightening the impurity limits when sufficient 
commercial scale experience has been gained to fully assess the capability of the 
manufacturing process. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), clarity of 
solution, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents and volatile organic impurities 
(GC), metals (ICP), particle size (Ph. Eur.), and polymorphic form (DSC – Ph. Eur.). Rationale 
for the absence of tests for water content (non-hygroscopic) and microbiological testing (low 
water content and water activity, isolation from organic solvent) was considered justified. 
Residue on ignition testing is not suitable as the active substance contains phosphorous: this 
test is replaced with a combination of clarity of solution test and ICP for elemental impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on 33 batches of the active substance ranging from laboratory through pilot 
to commercial scale, and used for development, stability, toxicology, clinical studies, and 
validation were provided. Assessment focussed primarily on later pilot commercial scale 
batches used for development, stability and validation. The results were within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 8 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers, as 
well as the applicant itself, in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market, for up to 12 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 15/100 
 
  
  
provided. Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. 
Stressed studies were carried out on a single batch between -20 and 50 oC for up to 4 weeks. 
Forced degradation was carried out under acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (10 mM Na2CO3) and 
oxidative (3% H2O2) conditions and at 105 oC. 
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, impurity content, water content, and 
polymorphic form. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, except for water 
content, measured by GVS, and were stability indicating. 
Sofosbuvir was shown to be stable under long-term, accelerated and stressed conditions and is 
not sensitive to light. Forced degradation revealed that the active substance may degrade via 
oxidation or hydrolysis in solution, but remains stable in the solid state even up to 105 oC after 
1 week. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed 
container. 
The applicant commits to the continuation of all on-going stability studies under long term 
conditions up to the 60 month time point. In addition, stability studies will be carried out on the 
first 3 commercial batches of Sofosbuvir. Furthermore, at least 1 commercial batch from each 
proposed manufacturer per year will be placed on a long-term stability study. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of formulation development was to develop an immediate-release oral dosage 
form of Sofosbuvir with acceptable chemical and physical stability as well as reliable release 
and bioavailability. The active substance is a crystalline solid, routinely manufactured as the 
most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form containing small quantities of an equivalent 
polymorphic form. It exhibits pH-independent solubility across a pH range from 1.2-7.7. 
Sofosbuvir is highly soluble but has low apparent intestinal permeability (BCS class III). Particle 
size was found to be critical for dissolution rate, so the active substance is sieved or screen 
milled and particle size is controlled by specification. 
The most thermodynamically stable polymorph is the third form used in product development. 
Initially, a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers (at the phosphorous centre) was used in clinical 
development since the active substance is a pro-drug and the diastereomeric centre is removed 
by metabolism. The phosphoester bond is cleaved in vivo and the resultant primary alcohol 
converted to the active triphosphate analogue. Phase II studies were carried out with a 
metastable polymorphic form of the diastereopure active substance. The thermodynamically 
most stable form was used in phase III studies following a pharmacokinetic study, and was the 
chosen commercial form. 
Excipients were originally chosen for compatibility with the metastable form described above. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur standards, except for the film-coating, Opadry II yellow which is manufactured by an 
established supplier and tested according to established methods. There are no novel excipients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 16/100 
 
  
  
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. 
The film-coating was intended to to mask the taste of the active ingredient and provide the 
product with a unique trade dress. The formulation used during phase III clinical studies is the 
same as that proposed for marketing. Rapid and complete dissolution was demonstrated in 
both simulated fed and fasted gastric fluid. Dissolution profiles are similar between the clinically 
relevant polymorphic forms with >80% active substance dissolved within 20 minutes in each 
case. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The critical quality 
attributes identified were appearance, strength, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and 
degradant and water content. The tableting process was evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and 
critical process parameters. Critical process steps and process parameters of the manufacturing 
process steps, (dry granulation, compression and film-coating), that could have an influence on 
the finished product quality attributes were examined experimentally. The risk identification 
was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing 
processes, as well as on the experience from formulation development, process design and 
scale-up studies. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. However, 
although design spaces were identified for some unit operations, these have not been formally 
applied for. The applicant will operate within normal operating ranges and any movement 
outside the approved limits will be subject to post-authorisation variation applications. 
The primary packaging is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene 
child-resistant closure, a silica gel desiccant and polyester coil. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
Magnesium stearate used in the manufacture of Sofosbuvir tablets is obtained exclusively from 
vegetable sources. No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is carried out by two manufacturers and consists of 4 main steps: 
(i) Sofosbuvir is blended, milled, and then dry-granulated with intra-granular excipients 
(mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica and 
magnesium stearate); (ii) the granules are blended with extra-granular excipients 
(microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica and magnesium 
stearate) and compressed to form the tablet cores; (iii) the tablet cores are film-coated; (iv) 
the finished product is packaged. The manufacturing process is considered to be standard for 
the production of film-coated tablets. Therefore, formal validation of the process in the 
production facilities has not yet been completed but will be carried out prior to release of 
Sovaldi film-coated tablets to the market. A process validation scheme has been presented 
which is considered acceptable. 
Powder-blending, tableting, and film-coating were all shown to be critical to producing a 
finished product of sufficient quality. Operating parameters with normal operating ranges

EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 17/100 
 
  
  
(NORs) and in-process controls were defined and robustness studies carried out. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner on commercial scale. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specification includes tests for appearance (visual description), 
identification (HPLC and UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), degradants (HPLC) 
uniformity of dosage unit (Ph. Eur), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), and microbiological limits (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results from 16 pilot and commercial scale batches covering both proposed 
manufacturers confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process 
is capable and under control. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold 
according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate 
specifications have been set based on the manufacturing experience to date. It is 
recommended that the applicant considers tightening the limits for a number of specified 
degradation products when sufficient commercial scale experience has gained to fully assess 
the capability of the manufacturing process. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 commercial scale batches of finished product from each proposed 
manufacturer stored under long term conditions for up to 12 months at 25ºC / 60% RH, for up 
to 12 months under intermediate conditions at 30ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing. In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
The same batch was tested in an open-dish study, stored outside of the primary packaging 
under long-term or intermediate conditions for 45 days. Stress testing was also carried out on 
this batch, which was stored in the primary packaging for 45 days at 5 or 50 oC, or at 25 oC in 
80% humidity. 
Samples were tested for appearance, strength, degradation products, dissolution, and water 
content at each time point. Additionally, microbiological testing is performed on an annual 
basis. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Sovaldi film-coated tablets met with the proposed specification limits after storage under long-
term, intermediate and accelerated conditions. The tablets were shown not to be light-
sensitive. No degradation products were observed throughout the stressed studies. A slight 
increase in water content was noted during the open dish study, but the level remained within 
specifications and had no impact on the quality of tablets. 
Stability studies under long-term and intermediate conditions will be continued until the 60 
month time-point. In addition, the applicant commits to instigating stability studies under long-
term and accelerated conditions on the first 3 commercial batches, as well as on 1 commercial 
batch per year thereafter. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP notes that the applicant has agreed with the Committee’s recommendation 
to re-define the starting materials, implement GMP for step C by end of March 2014, and 
update the dossier via standard post-approval variation procedures. 
In addition, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  Review the limits for impurities when sufficient commercial scale experience has been 
gained to fully assess the capability of the active substance manufacturing process. If 
necessary, specification of the active substance should be tightened via appropriate 
regulatory procedure.  
•  Review the limits for specified degradation products when sufficient commercial scale 
experience has been gained to fully assess the capability of the finished product 
manufacturing process and its long term stability. If necessary, specification of the 
finished product should be tightened via appropriate regulatory procedure. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non clinical package was provided, including a single-dose oral toxicity study 
in rats; repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in mice (up to 3 months), rats (up to 6 months) and 
dogs (up to 9 months), genotoxicity tests both in vitro and in vivo; and a full developmental 
and reproductive toxicity program. Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have 
also been provided during the procedure. 
All of the definitive safety pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies were conducted 
in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Pilot, exploratory, and mechanistic studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 19/100 
 
  
  
were either conducted in full compliance with GLP procedures or were conducted using 
appropriate protocols and documentation to assure data integrity. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Sofosbuvir is a prodrug of 2’-deoxy-2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyluridine monophosphate that is 
phosphorylated intracellularly to the active triphosphate form (GS-461203). The nucleoside 
triphosphate is a non-obligate chain-terminating analogue of UTP that competes for 
incorporation at the HCV NS5B polymerase active site. Viral RNA synthesis is inhibited 
secondary to incorporation of the phosphorylated metabolite into nascent viral RNA by the HCV 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In biochemical assays direct inhibition of NS5B polymerase 
was shown and characterised by IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 μM.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Sofosbuvir (S-diastereomer at phosphorus) and the diastereomeric mixture GS-9851 (isomeric 
mixture at phosphorus containing the S-diastereomer sofosbuvir and the R-diastereomer GS-
491241) appeared to have a low potential for mitochondrial toxicity in cell-based assays as 
determined by measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion or selective cytochrome c 
oxidase protein depletion. The triphosphate metabolite had no significant inhibitory activity on 
human DNA polymerases α, β and γ or RNA polymerase II as reflected in IC50>200 μM.   
In studies to determine potential for off target activity of GS-9851 no inhibition or induction 
greater that 50% at 10 μM was recorded in a panel of 171 receptors, enzymes and ion 
channels, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. These test systems used various cell 
types, platelets and tissue systems and incubation times ranging from 10 min to hours. In an 
additional specific study to examine the effects of the major, inactive, metabolite GS-331007 
(the nucleoside derivative) on a panel of receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, GS-331007 did 
not show > 50% inhibition or induction of any target at 10 µM. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-9851 had no activity (EC50>100 µM) against other viruses such as HIV-1 
and hepatitis B virus (HBV). At 100 µM GS-9851 showed an 18% inhibition of HBV.   
Safety pharmacology programme 
Single oral doses of GS-9851 up to 1,000 mg/kg in rat and dog had no major effects on 
parameters monitored to determine potential for interference with the central nervous, 
respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In vitro, no significant inhibition of hERG current by 
GS-9851, GS-566500, GS-606965 and GS-331007 was reported at the highest concentrations 
used (100-300 µM).   
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential for pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interactions is discussed in the Clinical section of 
the report.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK parameters of sofosbuvir were determined in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. The oral 
bioavailability following administration to portal vein cannulated dogs was determined as 
approximately 10% while in pentagastrin-treated dogs bioavailability was reported as 18.7%. 
The hepatic extraction ratio was estimated as 74%. In vitro sofosbuvir was found to have a 
partially saturable efflux and low forward permeability as assessed in Caco-2 cell monolayers. 
Studies in vitro on CYP inhibition/induction, protein binding and transporters are available and 
assessed in the clinical PK section. 
The stability of sofosbuvir and GS-9851 was investigated in vitro. The compounds were found 
to be stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. GS-9851 was degraded rapidly in blood of 
mouse and rat, but was stable in non-rodent blood. Additional studies showed that sofosbuvir 
and GS-9851 were unstable in mouse and rat plasma due to esterase activity. Sofosbuvir, its 
diastereomer and the isomeric mixture GS-9851 were stable in human plasma.  
Protein binding was low both for sofosbuvir and its major metabolite GS-331007 in dog and 
human. Due to instability protein binding for sofosbuvir could not be determined in mouse, rat 
and rabbit plasma, but protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in mouse, rat and rabbit. 
Tissue distribution was studied using whole body quantitative autoradiography and data 
indicated a similar pattern of distribution in albino and pigmented animals with levels generally 
higher in tissues of albino animals at 1 hour post dose, but lower than in pigmented animals at 
24 hours. After single oral doses of 20 mg/kg in partially pigmented rats highest levels of 
radiolabel were generally determined at 4 to 6 hours post dose. Tissues with highest 
radioactivity included liver, alimentary canal, renal cortex, lymph node, spleen, thymus, bone 
marrow and lung. Levels in brain were low, but quantifiable up to 24 hours. There was no 
specific association of radioactive material with melanin. Studies in pregnant rats showed that 
sofosbuvir crossed the placenta. Foetal blood and brain sofosbuvir derived radioactivity was 
higher than in dams, but foetal liver and kidney had lower levels than corresponding organs in 
dams. Sofosbuvir-derived radioactivity was also quantifiable in milk from day 2 postpartum 
rats, but nursing pups did not appear to be extensively exposed to drug-derived radioactivity. 
Milk to plasma ratios were 0.1 at 1 hour and 0.8 at 24 hours. 
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that sofosbuvir was an efficient substrate 
for Cathepsin A (Cat A) and carboxyl esterase 1 (CES1). There were no indications of 
metabolism via urdine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) or flavin-containing 
monooxygenase (FMO). Sofosbuvir was cleaved by CatA and CES1 and subsequent activation 
steps included amino acid removal by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) and 
phosphorylation by uridine monophosphate-cytidine monophosphate (UMP-CMP) kinase and 
nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase. In vitro data indicated that Cat A preferentially 
hydrolysed sofosbuvir (the S-diastereomer) while CES1 did not exhibit stereoselectivity. This 
would be consistent with studies using GS-9851 showing a less efficient metabolism to the 
triphosphate in the hepatically-derived cell line containing the Clone A replicon and shown to 
exhibit low CES 1 activity, but high Cat A activity compared with primary human hepatocytes.  
Following incubation of hepatocytes from rat, dog, monkey and human GS-9851 was converted 
to the triphosphate GS-461203 in all species, most efficiently in human. Sofosbuvir was also 
readily converted to the triphosphate in dog liver after oral doses and was the dominant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 21/100 
 
  
  
metabolite at all time points assessed with a long half-life of approx. 18 hours. The active 
metabolite GS-461203 could not be detected in monkey. Further while GS-461203 was 
detected in rat liver, it could not be measured in liver from mouse. 
Isomeric conversion was not evident in rat, dog and human plasma and human urine.  
After single oral doses in mouse and rat GS-9851 was not detected in plasma, but the 
nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 could be determined in plasma and liver. Overall no marked 
differences in PK between male and female animals were evident and no accumulation 
appeared to take place after repeated doses.  
In male mice given a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg of sofosbuvir, two metabolites GS-331007 
and GS-566500, were found in plasma, accounting for 86.5% and 13.5%, respectively, of total 
plasma radioactivity. These two metabolites were also detected in urine with GS-331007, 
accounting for 55.2% of radioactivity in 0-168 hours. In mouse faeces, only GS-331007 was 
observed and amounted to 14.1% of total radioactivity in 0-168 hours.  
In male rats given a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg of sofosbuvir, the major metabolite in plasma 
was GS-331007 (M1) accounting for 84.2% of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 
of total plasma radioactivity. GS-566500 (M2) was observed in plasma at levels of 10.6%. In 
urine GS-331007 and GS-566500 were major components. In another study using female rats 
plasma M1 was 53.9% and M2 was present at 14.2%. In rat liver three metabolites, M1 (4.8%, 
GS-331007), M2 (0.9%, GS-566500) and M3 (GS-606965) were observed, the latter a minor 
component. The parent compound was not detected in plasma, urine or faeces. The major 
pathway in rat was hydrolysis of GS-7977 to GS-331007 and minor pathways were hydrolysis 
of GS-7977 to GS-566500 and GS-606965.  
In dog following a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg of sofosbuvir three metabolites in plasma were 
identified, GS-331007, GS-566500 and M4 (proposed glucuronidation product of GS-606965), 
accounting for 93.4%, 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively of total plasma AUC. Parent compound 
amounted to 4.5%. In dog (and mouse) the majority of a radioactive dose was recovered in 
urine within 8 to 12 hours. 
GS-331007 and GS-566500 were detected in all species with GS-331007 being the major drug-
related material in all species and all matrices. In plasma, urine and faeces of all species 
administered sofosbuvir the primary metabolite detected was GS-331007 accounting for >80% 
of total exposure. In rat liver and plasma GS-566500 was also detected. The metabolite profile 
was overall comparable between non-pregnant, pregnant and postpartum rats and in milk of 
postpartum rats with GS-331007 and 2 sulfate conjugates of GS-331007 being the major 
metabolites. 
The major species used in toxicology studies, rat and dog, appear to have been adequately 
characterised pharmacokinetically. Less data is available for the rabbit, the second species used 
in studies on reproduction toxicity, but it has been ascertained that GS-331007 is formed in this 
species. The data indicate species differences in the disposition of sofosbuvir that could partly 
relate both to rate of hydrolysis in primary matrices as well as to the formation of the active 
triphosphate metabolite. Thus, sofosbuvir can be detected in human plasma, but not in species 
(rat) used in general toxicology studies, micronucleus study (mouse) and reproduction toxicity 
studies (rat) also indicating that, in contrast to the major metabolite (M1) that is formed in all 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 22/100 
 
  
  
species, the potential toxicity of sofosbuvir may not have been fully investigated. In addition, 
the extent of exposure to the active triphosphate is unclear and it is noted that while this could 
be detected in rat liver, levels could not be determined in mouse liver, likely at least partly due 
to technical particulars. Formation of the triphosphate was shown in hepatocytes from human, 
dog, monkey and rat. The triphosphate was also detected in dog and rat liver, but in monkey 
and mouse, liver levels were below the limit of detection. This variability is likely explained by 
factors related partly to technical difficulties. The assessment of liver metabolite levels is part of 
an exploratory analysis in explanted liver tissues taken from HCV-infected subjects undergoing 
liver transplantation after up to 48 weeks of SOF/RBV as part of the ongoing study P7977-2025 
(see below).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In the non-clinical testing program, sofosbuvir was administered orally to CD-1 mice, Sprague-
Dawley rats, and Beagle dogs for general toxicity evaluation. The oral route of administration 
was chosen because this is the route of administration in patients. The diastereomeric mixture 
GS-9851 was used in early nonclinical and clinical studies, but the single diastereomer 
sofosbuvir (SOF) was chosen for development and registration. Pivotal toxicology studies were 
conducted with SOF, and carried out in accordance with GLP. The non-clinical toxicological 
package is considered to comply with current ICH guidelines. However, it should be noted that 
it was not possible to determine exposure to sofosbuvir in rodents likely due to high esterase 
activity and that the level of exposure to the active moiety, the triphosphate, which is mainly 
present intracellularly, is generally not known in the toxicology studies. Exposure margins are 
therefore primarily calculated using the major metabolite GS-331007. The only dose-related 
substance with a systemic exposure of >10% of total radioactivity was GS-331007 also 
indicating that only this metabolite would require qualification in non-clinical studies. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity study was performed with GS-9851/PSI-7851 (the diastereomeric mixture) 
in rats. No mortality, clinical signs, body weight changes, macroscopic pathology, or organ 
weight changes for liver and kidney up to a highest dose of 1,800 mg/kg (maximum observed 
concentration [Cmax] 15(M)/15(F) µg/ml and AUClast 205(M)/176(F) µg·h/ml for GS-331007). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Sofosbuvir was generally well tolerated for up to 3 months in the mouse, 6 months in the rat, 
and 9 months in the Beagle dog. Target organs for toxicity were the heart, liver, 
gastrointestinal tract, and haematopoietic cells. Preterminal mortalities occurred in rats at high 
dose levels (27-fold clinical exposure as based on AUC), and in a single dog dosed at 500 
mg/kg/day for 6 months (24-fold clinical exposure as based on AUC).   
Preterminal mortalities 
In the 14-day dose range finding study in mice, one male dosed at 1500 mg/kg/day was found 
dead on day 10. The cause of death was not determined. In the 3-month mouse study, 
preterminal mortality occurred at all dose levels (≥100 mg/kg/day), and also in controls. There 
was no clear dose response, and in several cases the cause of death was due to gavage error 
and aspiration. Cause of death could not be determined in all cases; however, histopathological 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 23/100 
 
  
  
examination was not carried out on toxicokinetic (TK) animals. No target organs for toxicity 
were identified and the only effects related to dosing with sofosbuvir were lower food 
consumption and decreased body weight and body weight gain at the high dose level. Taken 
together, these data do not substantiate a clear causative link between sofosbuvir treatment 
and preterminal mortality in mice.   
In the 7-day rat study, 2,000 mg/kg/day resulted in early mortalities probably due to 
myocardial degeneration (see under Heart). In the 9-month dog study, one male dosed at 500 
mg/kg/day was preterminally sacrificed on Day 172. According to the applicant, the clinical and 
post-mortem findings in this dog were typical of idiopathic haemorrhagic gastroenteritis, a 
spontaneous disease of unknown aetiology. However, in view of the fact that haemorrhage in 
the stomach or intestine was observed in two high dose dogs in the 7-day and 1-month studies, 
respectively, it seems more likely that the haemorrhagic enteritis in the preterminally killed dog 
in the 9-month study was in fact due to treatment with sofosbuvir. 
Heart 
In the 7-day rat study, 2,000 mg/kg/day resulted in early mortalities probably due to 
myocardial degeneration. This finding was also present in 2/3 surviving females dosed at 2,000 
mg/kg/day, as evaluated after a 14-day recovery period. The margin to the no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for myocardial degeneration and associated mortality in the 7-day 
rat study is small (3-fold based on AUC). However, cardiac toxicity/mortality occurred only at 
the highest dose level (2,000 mg/kg/day) and no doses between 250 and 2000 mg/kg/day 
were tested. In longer duration studies (up to 6 months), no cardiac toxicity or mortalities 
occurred at 9-fold exposure levels to clinical AUC. Taken together, the nonclinical data indicate 
that cardiac toxicity was observed only in the early dose-range finding rat study at high 
systemic exposure achieved at a lethal dose level and was not observed in any other toxicity 
studies, including the carcinogenicity studies. 
Vacuolar degeneration of the myocardial muscle fibres was observed in the preterminally killed 
dog in the 9-month study. The study pathologist speculated that this finding may have been a 
response to hypotension, tachycardia, and hypovolaemia secondary to haemorrhagic enteritis. 
This explanation seems plausible, although a direct effect on the myocardium cannot be 
completely excluded. No histopathological myocardial changes were observed in other dogs, in 
any of the conducted studies.   
QT prolongation was present in males dosed at 1,500 mg/kg/day in the 7-day study, but did 
not occur in the longer term dog studies.  The systemic exposure (Cmax) to GS-331007 at 1,500 
mg/kg/day was 90-fold higher than the clinical exposure in patients treated at 400 mg and 
likely exposure to sofosbuvir was also significant although not directly determined in this study.  
Taken together, these animal data do not indicate that sofosbuvir is likely to produce QT 
prolongation in patients treated at the recommended dose of 400 mg.  
Gastrointestinal tract 
Diarrhoea and other clinical signs related to effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurred in 
all repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, from 7 days up to 6 months. Some of these effects 
also occurred, to a lesser degree, in control animals, suggesting that the vehicle may have 
contributed. There were no histopathological changes in the GI tract of rats. In some studies, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 24/100 
 
  
  
the GI effects were associated with decreased body weight/body weight gain and decreased 
food consumption.  
Clinical exposure margins to the GI effects in rats are small or non-existent. The applicant 
argues that the GI effects resolved in many rats with continued dosing, had no effect on the 
general welfare of the animals, and were not associated with any histopathological findings. 
Due to these circumstances, and also because of the vehicle contributory effect, the applicant 
proposed a NOAEL at the high dose (500 mg/kg/day) for both the 1- and 3-month studies. 
However, the treatment-related GI effects were more pronounced in the 1- and 3-month 
studies as compared with the 6-month study and thus it is considered that the originally (in the 
study reports) proposed NOAEL at 20 mg/kg/day in the 1-month study, and <20 mg/kg/day in 
the 3-month study, shall remain. It is agreed that the vehicle may have contributed to a certain 
degree, and thus it is unclear whether these effects are relevant to the clinical situation. Since 
the GI effects in rats were not associated with any histopathological changes, and furthermore 
were fully reversible upon cessation of dosing, they are not considered to be of major concern 
for human safety despite the small exposure margins.  
Diarrhoea and emesis were also present in all dog repeated-dose toxicity studies, from 7 days 
up to 9 months. In some studies, these GI effects were associated with decreased body 
weight/body weight gain and decreased food consumption. The lowest NOAEL for GI effects in 
the dog was 20 mg/kg/day in the 3-month study, corresponding to a 2-fold exposure margin 
based on AUC.  Increased mucus secretion in the stomach was observed in dogs treated at 
1,500 mg/kg/day in the 7-day study, possibly indicating local irritancy. Haemorrhage was 
present in the lamina propria of the colon in one high dose recovery dog in the 7-day study, 
and also in the lamina propria of the stomach pylorus region in a dog treated at 500 mg/kg/day 
in the 3-month study. Furthermore, haemorrhage was observed in the lamina propria of the 
jejunum in the preterminally killed high dose dog in the 9-month study. The lowest NOAEL for 
haemorrhage in the GI tract was 100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month Phase of the 9-month study, 
corresponding to a 10-fold exposure margin based on AUC. Thus, there is an acceptable margin 
to these more severe GI effects in dogs. Similar to the situation in rats, all GI effects in dogs 
were reversible upon cessation of dosing.  
Liver 
Increased liver weights were observed at ≥100 mg/kg/day in the 1-month rat study, at ≥30 
mg/kg/day in the 7-day dog study, and at 500 and ≥100 mg/kg/day in the 1-month and 3-
month dog studies, respectively. At the high dose level (1,500 mg/kg/day) in the 7-day dog 
study, this organ weight increase correlated with hepatocellular hypertrophy. There was an 
increase in CYP2A1 activity in rats at the high dose level (500 mg/kg/day) in the 1-month 
study. Although liver samples for CYP analysis were taken in the 1-month dog study, they were 
not analysed. The increased liver weights in both rats and dogs, as well as the hepatocellular 
hypertrophy in dogs, are most likely related to the induction of drug-metabolising enzymes, 
which is an adaptive and non-adverse effect.    
Histopathological liver findings at 1,500 mg/kg/day in the 7-day dog study included hepatocyte 
apoptosis, microvesiculation, decreased intracellular glycogen, and Kupffer cell pigmentation. 
These findings were associated with increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alkalin phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin. Except for the decreased 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 25/100 
 
  
  
glycogen, the margin to the NOAEL for these effects is 13-fold based on AUC. Decreased 
glycogen was present in all dose groups, but not associated with increased liver enzymes or any 
other liver effects at the mid and low dose levels and is thus not considered to be an adverse 
effect. All histopathological liver findings and associated clinical chemistry changes in the 7-day 
dog study were reversible after the 14-day recovery period. No histopathological liver findings 
were present in the longer term dog studies at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a 
24-fold exposure margin (GS-331007) as based on AUC in the 9-month study. 
Haematopoietic cells 
Effects on erythropoiesis were present in the 7-day rat study (3-fold margin to NOAEL as based 
on AUC) and in all dog studies, from 7 days up to 9 months. The lowest exposure margin to 
NOAEL in dogs for these effects was 5-fold, as based on AUC (dog 1-month study). 
Haematology analysis showed decreased red blood cell count and lower haemoglobin and/or 
haematocrit concentrations. The decreased erythron mass was reflected in bone marrow 
changes such as lower percentage of erythroid precursors and depression of erythropoiesis. 
Both the peripheral and bone marrow changes were reversible. In the 6-month Phase of the 9-
month dog study, there were bone marrow alterations at the high dose (500 mg/kg/day), which 
were not present at the end of the 9-month study.  
Exposure margins were low, but according to the applicant, sofosbuvir has not been associated 
with haematologic side effects in the clinic when administered as monotherapy. However, such 
effects have been observed in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, when sofosbuvir has been 
coadministered with RBV with or without PEG. Both these substances are known to cause 
haematologic toxicity. 
Other noteworthy findings 
Lymphocyte depletion/necrosis and thymus atrophy occurred in rats and dogs treated at high 
dose levels and are considered to reflect generalised stress. Adrenal cortical hypertrophy at 
1500 mg/kg/day in the 7-day dog study is also considered to be related to stress. These 
findings were reversible upon cessation of dosing.  
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was increased at 1,500 mg/kg/day in the 7-day 
dog study (not reversible after 14 days), and at ≥100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month Phase of the 
9-month dog study (reversible after 1 month). The increase was slight, and there did not seem 
to be any correlation with the intestinal haemorrhage present in the preterminally killed high 
dose dog.  
Transient lameness was noted in dogs ≥100 mg/kg in the 9-month study. According to the 
applicant, the most likely cause of lameness was incidental injury. However, no incidents of 
lameness were observed in vehicle-treated control dogs. It should be noted that 
limping/lameness was present in single male dogs at 100 mg/kg/day in the 1- and 3-months 
studies. Even so, it is agreed that no causal relationship has been established.  
A few other findings (e.g. organ weight changes, alterations in urine parameters etc) with 
potential or uncertain relationship to treatment with sofosbuvir were either of small magnitude 
or inconsistent between studies, and thus their relevance to the human clinical situation is 
questionable.

Genotoxicity 
The diastereomeric mixture of SOF (GS-9851/PSI-7851) was shown to be negative in vitro in 
the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay and in a mammalian chromosome 
aberration test performed in primary human lymphocytes. An in vivo chromosome aberration 
assay in mouse was also negative. A sufficiently high exposure of the two metabolites GS-
566500 (AUClast 194(M)/134(F) μg·h/ml) and GS-331007 (AUClast 133(M)/115(F) μg·h/ml) was 
achieved, while exposure to SOF (GS-9851) was low (AUClast 0.7(M)/3.6(F) μg·h/ml). The 
results suggest that SOF does not have any genotoxic potential.  
Carcinogenicity 
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect after 2-year daily oral gavage administration of 
SOF to rats or mice.  At the highest doses tested, exposures to the metabolite GS-331007 were 
7/30 (male/female) and 13/17 (male/ female) times higher in mice and rats, respectively, as 
compared to the clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir (AUCtau 7.20 µg.h/ml). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Daily oral doses of SOF at up to 500 mg/kg for 28 days (males) or 14 days (females) prior to 
cohabitation, during cohabitation, and through scheduled termination (males) or Day 7 of 
gestation (females) did not adversely affect mating, fertility, or embryo survival at any dose 
level. SOF did not affect reproductive organ weight or produce macroscopic findings or 
histopathologic findings in reproductive organs in either sex in the performed repeat dose 
toxicity studies. SOF is therefore not expected to have any effect on fertility.  
Embryo-foetal studies were performed with SOF in rats and rabbits. In rats SOF did not affect 
intrauterine growth and survival (mean numbers and/or litter proportions of viable foetuses, 
postimplantation loss and foetal body weights). No effects were seen on external, visceral, and 
skeletal foetal morphology at dose levels up to 500 mg/kg/day. Maternal and foetal NOAEL was 
therefore considered to be 500 mg/kg. At this dose, the maternal AUC0–24 for GS-331007 on 
gestation day (GD) 18 was 72 μg·h/ml and at GD6 34 μg·h/ml. When compared to the mean 
AUC at the recommended clinical dose (400 mg), the margin of exposure for GS-331007 at the 
NOAEL in this study is 10. Pregnant rabbits tolerated daily oral doses of SOF up to 300 mg/kg 
during the period of major organogenesis without any adverse effects of any sort on either the 
dams or developing foetuses. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is considered to be 300 
mg/kg/day, which produced a systemic exposure of 8.66 and 200 μg·h/ml for SOF and its 
metabolite GS-331007, respectively, corresponding to exposure margins for SOF and GS-
331007 of 10 and 28, respectively, when compared to the mean AUC at the recommended 
clinical dose (400 mg). 
In the prenatal and postnatal development study performed in rats no adverse SOF-related 
effects were noted in F0 females at any dosage level during gestation and lactation and F1 
postnatal survival, body weights, developmental landmarks, startle response, motor activity, 
learning and memory and reproductive performance were unaffected. Intrauterine growth and 
survival of F2 foetuses were also unaffected. No SOF-related external malformations or 
developmental variations were noted in F2 foetuses. Animals were not exposed to significant 
levels of SOF while exposure to the metabolite GS-331007 were 12 times the expected 
maximum clinical exposure in F0 dams after exposure to 500 mg/kg/day at lactation day (LD)

10 (AUC0-24 83 μg·h/ml) and ~6 times at GD6 (AUC0-24 40 μg·h/ml). F1 Pups were found to be 
exposed to significant but ~50 times lower levels of the metabolite GS-331007 (AUC0-24 1.5 
μg·h/ml in the 500 mg/kg/day group) on postnatal day (PND) 10, but not to be exposed to GS-
566500. 
According to the relevant Guideline “The dose range tested by the applicant should have 
covered a dose resulting in minimal maternal toxicity such as e.g. decreased body weight or 
food consumption.” Since no effects were seen on body weight or food consumption in the 
studies performed it is concluded that the dose range used in the studies was not high enough 
to fully explore the potential of sofosbuvir to induce reproductive and developmental toxicity. In 
addition, due to the high plasma esterase activity in rats and absence of sofosbuvir in plasma it 
is concluded that the studies on embryo foetal toxicity in rabbits, where plasma levels higher 
than that expected in the clinical situation were detected, is the only study where possible 
effects of sofosbuvir per se have been investigated. The active triphosphate GS-461203 was 
detected in rat liver samples despite the lack of detectable SOF plasma levels, indicating that 
prodrug exposure was achieved in rats. However, it is not possible to compare the tissue levels 
of the active triphosphate obtained with that in humans and it is therefore not possible to fully 
estimate exposure margins achieved for either sofosbuvir or its metabolites relative to the 
exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose.  
No toxicity studies in juvenile animals were conducted with SOF which is considered to be 
acceptable since sofosbuvir will initially be registered for adults only. 
Local Tolerance  
SOF is predicted to be a non-corrosive/ non-severe eye irritant based on results from an in 
vitro Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay and is classified as a “non-irritant” in a 
dermal irritation study in rabbits. In addition results from a Local lymph node assay indicate 
that SOF is not a skin sensitizer. 
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities  
Phenol, GS-566500, GS-606965 and GS-331007 are metabolites of SOF and are considered to 
be qualified at the proposed levels in drug product (0.5 % at shelf life). The proposed 
specification levels of 0.5 % (at shelf life), equal to ~0.04 mg/kg/day (2 mg/day/50 kg), for 
GS-607699 and GS-607670 in drug product and the process impurities GS-491241, GS-615014 
and GS-617190 present in the drug substance, are also considered to be acceptable from a 
toxicological point of view. 
Sofosbuvir and the process intermediates generated during manufacture were evaluated in 
silico for potential genotoxicity using two predictive toxicity software programs, DEREK for 
Windows (Lhasa Ltd) and FDA Model Applier (Leadscope). Upstream intermediates from the 
synthesis of the starting materials were also examined by DEREK.  
The genetic toxicity suite of the Leadscope Model Applier software resulted in positive 
genotoxicicty predictions for sofosbuvir and some of the process intermediates. The large 
majority of these structural features in the alerting intermediates were also found in the 
positive prediction for sofosbuvir. However, since all structural feature hits identified by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 28/100 
 
  
  
Leadscope for process intermediates either map to the same features identified by Leadscope 
for sofosbuvir or were concluded to be entirely implausible when evaluated using well-founded 
chemical principles, Leadscope Model Applier software was concluded not to provide a reliable 
prediction of genetic toxicity for sofosbuvir process intermediates. This was further supported 
by the DEREK Evaluation of Sofosbuvir, process intermediates and precursors to the starting 
materials which did not reveal any structural alerts except for the precursor GS-606978. 
The only compound identified from in silico screening that may be a potential genotoxic 
impurity was therefore concluded to be the chloride GS-606978. Purging studies and batch 
analysis demonstrate that GS-606978 is effectively purged and decomposed during the 
sofosbuvir production process. Spikes of up to 50,000 ppm purged to less than 0.50 ppm when 
carried through the representative process. These results thus demonstrate that even if GS-
606978 were present in starting material at the limit for an unspecified impurity (not more than 
[NMT] 0.15%), it would be purged well below the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) limit 
of 1.5 μg/day or 3.75 ppm for a 400 mg daily dose of sofosbuvir. 
Bridging toxicity studies 
14-day bridging toxicity studies comparing the isomeric mixture (PSI-7851) with the single 
isomer SOF (PSI-7977) have also been performed in rat and dog. No differences were detected 
and the toxicity and systemic exposure profiles were concluded to be similar for PSI-7851 and 
PSI-7977 in both studies. In the study in rat one male given PSI-7851 had minimal myofibre 
degeneration located at the apex of the heart. Because this finding was graded as minimal and 
can be a manifestation of cardiomyopathy that occurs spontaneously in rats, the finding may be 
incidental and unrelated to PSI-7851. This conclusion is further supported by historical control 
data for the incidence of cardiomyopathy within the same rat strain from the contract 
laboratory. The percentage of male control animals within a study that had cardiomyopathy 
ranged from 0% to 33% while in the 14-day bridging rat study with GS-9851 and SOF, the 
single incidence of cardiomyopathy in the GS-9851 group occurred at 10%, that is within the 
historical control of the laboratory. 
Phototoxicity  
No phototoxicity study has been performed with sofosbuvir. This is acceptable since sofosbuvir 
was shown not to absorb light within the range of 290 to 700 nm and since no accumulation in 
dermal or ocular tissues has been detected.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
SOF is a pro-drug and the active substance is the triphosphate GS-461203. Neither the pro-
drug SOF nor the active moiety GS-461203 enter the environment at >10% of the 
administered dose. Therefore neither SOF nor GS-461203 is considered to be environmentally 
relevant or present a potential environmental risk from their use in patients. The focus of the 
environmental risk assessment of SOF is instead GS-331007, the only drug residue detected in 
total excreta at >10% of the applied radioactive dose (GS-331007 accounted for 79.6%). 
The mean partition coefficient was 0.398, 0.286 and 0.0593, at pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively, 
(log K ow -0.417, -0.576 and -1.28, respectively) and GS-331007 is therefore not a persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT)-substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 29/100 
 
  
  
A refined market penetration of 3.5% (the highest relevant nationwide estimated prevalence) 
was used to calculate a refined PECsurface water value. The refined PECsurface water of 7.0 µg/L is 
significantly higher than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L (PECsurface water based on the default Fpen is 
2.0 µg/L and is thus also higher than the action limit). A Phase IIA assessment has therefore 
been performed and since a partition to sediment was indicated (> 10% AR shifted after 14 
days) a further assessment with a sediment dweller in Phase II B has also been performed. 
Since results indicate that GS-331007 does not adsorb to soils or activated sludges, aquatic 
toxicity has been the focus of Phase IIA analysis. 
None of the ratios between the predicted environmental concentrations and predicted no effect 
levels for the Sewage treatment plant-, Surface water- or Groundwater-compartment were 
above 1 and no further studies are therefore required. In the Phase IIB analysis on sediment 
dweller the risk quotient was also found to be below 1. 
The ultimate degradation of GS-331007, based on 14CO2 generated during the test, was 
between 10 – 20% after 100 days at 20°C (with DT50 values of 60 and 66 days for the total 
system dissipation in silt loam and sand sediments, respectively). A single significant 
transformation product was observed in surface water. This was identified as an oxidation 
product of GS-331007 (a carboxylic acid). Since this transformation product was not seen to 
degrade in the test system it is potentially persistent. 
Based on the data presented it is concluded that the environmentally relevant residue of 
sofosbuvir, GS-331007, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
However, considering the high HCV prevalence in some regions, and huge differences in 
effectiveness in collection systems of unused drugs, Sofosbuvir might be also relevant for ERA. 
The issue is addressed by including a precautionary statement in the Package Leaflet clearly 
warning against inappropriate disposal of unused medicines and directing patients to 
information sources able to provide details of local collection systems.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Sofosbuvir is a prodrug that is hydrolysed to an intermediate subsequently phosphorylated 
intracellularly to an active triphosphate form with activity against the HCV NS5B RNA 
polymerase. No significant inhibition of host polymerases by the active metabolite was evident.

Sofosbuvir also had no remarkable effects on parameters monitored to investigate 
mitochondrial toxicity in cell-based assays. Screening for secondary activity was conducted 
using the isomeric mixture and the metabolite GS-331007 at concentrations of 10 µM. From the 
non-clinical point of view the data has overall provided adequate characterisation of the 
primary pharmacology of sofosbuvir and its major metabolites.  
PK and toxicokinetic data with sofosbuvir seem overall sufficient. The assessment of sofosbuvir 
potential toxicity, general as well as reproductive, may, however, be compromised by species 
differences such that there are uncertainties as to the extent of exposure to both sofosbuvir 
and the active triphosphate metabolite. The parent drug sofosbuvir is, in contrast to in humans, 
not detectable in rodent plasma, likely due to high esterase activity. 
Sofosbuvir seemed overall well tolerated in general toxicity studies of up to 9 months in rat and 
dog. In toxicity studies at high doses noted effects were noted in the gastrointestinal tract, liver 
and the haematological system. Reproductive toxicity was studied in rat and rabbit and while 
no relevant potential for adverse reproductive effects was evident, the high dose likely was 
suboptimal in these studies.  
Studies in vitro and in vivo for genotoxic potential were negative and consistent with a low 
mutagenic potential of sofosbuvir. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat showed 
no carcinogenic potential for sofosbuvir. The only compound identified from in silico screening 
of process intermediates and precursors that may be a potential genotoxic impurity was 
concluded to be the chloride GS-606978, which was shown to be purged well below the TTC 
limit of 1.5 μg/day even if present in the starting material at the limit for an unspecified 
impurity (NMT 0.15%). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of non-clinical data available for sofosbuvir has provided adequate characterisation 
of primary pharmacological and toxicological properties of the compound and overall indicates 
no major issues for concern.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In clinical studies the exposure to sofosbuvir and two of its metabolites, GS-566500 and GS-
331007, has been determined using validated bioanalytical methods. Interconversion between 
sofosbuvir and its diastereomer GS-491241 has not been seen, neither in vitro nor in vivo in 
preclinical species. The active metabolite GS-461203 has not been measured in vivo. Efficacy, 
in terms of rapid viral response, has been shown to correlate with exposure to sofosbuvir as 
well as GS-331007. 
Absorption  
SOF is administered once daily as a 400 mg tablet. Following a single dose, the PK profile of 
sofosbuvir show rapid turnover with a t max of 0.5 h and a short half-life of approximately 0.5 h. 
The bioavailability of drug related material is moderate to high, at least 50%, although the 
absolute value is unknown. The commercial formulation is bioequivalent to the formulations 
used in pivotal efficacy and safety studies. 
In vitro studies show that SOF is subject to marked efflux, probably mediated by P-glycoprotein 
(Pgp) and/or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of a single dose of 600 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 36/100 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
mg Cyclosporin A (CsA) increased the exposure to sofosbuvir 4.5 fold providing further 
evidence of sofosbuvir being a sensitive substrate to efflux transporters. 
Exposure to SOF and GS-566500 is increased by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively, 
when taken with a high fat meal. The rate of absorption slows down. The exposure in terms of 
AUC to GS-331007 is not affected by a high fat meal although Cmax is 25% lower. The 
difference between SOF and GS-331007 with respect to food effect has not been explained. In 
pivotal clinical trials the recommendation has been to take SOF without regard to food. 
However, since SOF was taken together with RBV, which has to be taken with food, 
administration was in effect made in combination with a meal. Therefore the SmPC 
recommends that SOF is taken with food.  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of SOF (the fraction unbound is 18%) seems to be independent of 
concentration and no effect of renal impairment was seen on degree of binding. GS-331007 is 
minimally bound to plasma proteins. 
Elimination 
Sofosbuvir is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestine and in the liver. The 
active metabolite GS-461203 is formed through a chain of metabolic steps (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Intracellular metabolism pathway of GS-9851, GS-491241 and SOF (GS-
7977)
In vitro, SOF is rapidly hydrolysed by CatA and CES1 to form GS-566500 which is further 
metabolised to eventually form the active triphosphate nucleoside analogue GS-461203.  
Involvement of CYP enzymes in the metabolism of sofosbuvir cannot currently be ruled out. 
Sofosbuvir is subject to very little renal elimination (fractional excretion [fe]=3.5%). Renal 
excretion has a greater importance in the elimination of GS-566500 and GS-331007. Active 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 37/100 
 
 
  
  
secretion has a major role in the renal elimination; approximately half of the renal clearance of 
GS-331007 is due to active secretion. The transporters involved are unknown. 
The intermediate metabolite GS-566500 peaks at 1 h and has a half-life of 2 h. The major 
metabolite GS-331007 peaks at 2 h and has a half-life of 26 h. 
Most of a radioactively labelled SOF dose was excreted in urine (76%), predominantly as 
GS-331007 (78%) and to minor extent as SOF (<5%) and GS-566500 (<5%). In plasma, 
GS-331007 constituted the majority (90%) of measured radioactivity. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Apart from SOF, the PK of GS-331007 and GS-566500 has been measured and partly 
characterised. The PK of the pharmacologically active metabolite GS-461203 has not been 
characterised. It is not clear which of the available entities (SOF, GS-566500 or GS-331007) is 
most predictive of efficacy and/or safety. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Population PK analyses of GS-331007 and SOF were performed using all available intensive and 
sparse PK samples collected in Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in healthy and HCV-infected subjects. 
In the sofosbuvir Population PK model, apparent oral clearance after administration of the dose 
(CL/F) was approximately 30% lower in patients compared to healthy volunteers. In the GS-
331007 Population PK model, the different HCV genotypes were associated with 50% to 60% 
higher CL/F as compared to healthy volunteers. The differing effect of patient status has not 
been explained. The population PK models can currently only be used for description of the 
observed data and not for predictions. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A between study comparison indicated that near dose linearity was observed for SOF and 
GS-331007. However, the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the power model (AUCinf or Cmax vs 
dose) mean slope did not contain 1 neither for sofosbuvir, nor for GS-331007. There was no 
evidence of marked time dependency. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Severe renal impairment led to a more than 7-fold increase in exposure to GS-331007 while 
mild and moderate renal impairment increased GS-331007 exposure less than 2-fold. Exposure 
to SOF and GS-566500 was increased approximately 3-fold in subjects with severe renal 
impairment. Safety margins calculated from results of toxicology studies are 5.4 to 11.6 for 
SOF and 1.6 to 3.5 for GS-331007 in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment. The 
haemodialysis extraction ratio for GS-331007 was approximately 50%. Treatment of patients 
with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not recommended. 
Hepatic impairment 
Exposure to SOF and GS-566500 increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate 
(median Child-Pugh score of 8) and severe (median Child-Pugh score of 10) hepatic 
impairment. The exposure to GS-331007 was essentially unchanged. Of note, the viral 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 38/100 
 
  
  
response was numerically lower in patients with hepatic impairment compared to historical 
controls. 
Other intrinsic factors  
Influence of gender, race, weight and age was evaluated using a Population PK approach. No 
apparent effects were observed. There is a lack of clinical experience treating patients older 
than 65 years of age. No data are available on the exposure in children or adolescents. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Several in vitro DDI studies are inconclusive due to inadequate exposure to SOF. Further 
studies are being conducted to provide information about potential enzyme/transporter 
inhibition by SOF and results will be provided post-authorisation.  
Renal secretion is involved in the elimination of GS-566500 and GS-331007. The transporter(s) 
involved are unknown. It is also unknown whether hepatic transporters are involved in the 
taking up of the polar SOF and its metabolites into the hepatocytes. This will be further 
investigated post-authorisation. 
Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 was seen in vitro. An in vivo DDI study with oral 
contraceptives co-administered with sofosbuvir for 7 days did not show any sign of reduced 
exposure. The study is considered to be too short to fully exclude a minor induction. However, 
a clinically relevant effect is not expected based on the observed data. 
DDI studies have been performed in healthy volunteers and patients to evaluate effect of SOF 
on the PK of antiretroviral agents (ARVs), methadone, CsA and tacrolimus. Further, the effect 
of these medications on the PK of SOF and its metabolites has been evaluated. Generally, SOF 
had no or limited effect on the PK of co-administrated ARVs; only for raltegravir AUC was 
decreased by 27%. Methadone exposure was unaffected by SOF as were exposures to CyA and 
tacrolimus, although Cmax for tacrolimus was decreased by almost 30%. 
Potential interactions with telaprevir or boceprevir have not been studied. Therefore, 
concomitant use is not recommended. 
A 600 mg single dose of CyA had a large effect on SOF exposure with a 4.5-fold increase. 
However, the exposure to GS-331007 was not statistically different. Tacrolimus did not affect 
exposure to SOF or its metabolites. Darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg daily [q.d.]) increased 
exposure to SOF (34% increase) and to GS-566500 (80% increase), but not exposure to 
GS-331007. 
In vitro data indicate Pgp involvement in the absorption. Inducible enzymes may be involved in 
the elimination. The effect of strong Pgp inducers on SOF exposure has not been studied in 
vivo. Due to the risk of under-exposure, a warning has been included in the SmPC and 
concomitant use of strong Pgp inducers is not recommended. 
PK/PD relationship 
The following curve describes the relationship between GS-331007 AUCtau and change from 
baseline HCV-RNA during sofosbuvir or GS-9851 monotherapy after 3 days of treatment in 
subjects with genotype 1 infection.

High potency in terms of a rapid viral load decline, lack of on-treatment virological 
breakthrough, and lack of selection of evidently clinically relevant resistance, indicate that the 
dose selected for sofosbuvir gives adequate response. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
In human hepatocytes, SOF is converted to an active triphosphate metabolite (GS 461203). 
GS-461203 is a non-obligate chain-terminating analog of uridine triphosphate (UTP) that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 40/100 
 
 
 
  
  
inhibits viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into nascent viral RNA by the HCV NS5B 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 
Primary pharmacology 
In vitro activity 
GS 461203 has been shown to directly inhibit NS5B polymerase activity in a biochemical assay, 
at concentrations that resulted in 50% inhibition (IC50 values) ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 µM.  
SOF demonstrated in vitro activity against stable full-length HCV replicons as follows:

a  EC50 values are the average of at least 2 independent experiments. 
b  Stable chimeric genotype 1b replicons carried NS5B coding sequences from genotypes 2b, 5a, or 6a consensus 
sequences. 
Thus, estimated EC50 was lowest against genotypes 2b, 5a and 6a, whereas the highest value 
was for genotype 1b. 
No significant differences were observed in SOF EC50 or EC95 values in the presence and 
absence of human serum or human serum albumin. 
Baseline viral polymorphisms 
The applicant states that no baseline viral polymorphisms have been shown to impact the 
activity of SOF. However, as further discussed below, activity against genotype 1b may be 
lower than against genotype 1a, which may be clinically apparent when only SOF+RBV 
bitherapy is given. In this context, it is noted that the L159F variant was found in 9.4% of 
genotype 1b samples at baseline by population sequencing, and very rarely in genotype 1a. 
The relapse rate among patients with L159F at baseline in the Phase 2/3 program was 2/14. 
Thus, data are not indicative of any impact on response.   
In vitro and in vivo selection of resistance 
In vitro resistance selection experiments in replicon cells identified S282T as the primary 
resistance mutation in all genotypes (1–6) tested. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that 
S282T confers reduced susceptibility to SOF; however, the S282T mutation does not confer 
cross-resistance to other classes of antiviral inhibitors.

Resistance analyses were attempted on plasma HCV isolates from all subjects with HCV-RNA 
>1,000 IU/ml at the virologic failure time point or early discontinuation time point for those 
who had a plasma sample available. Among all SOF-treated subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 
studies, a total of 302 of 1,662 subjects qualified to be part of the resistance analysis 
population (RAP) with NS5B sequences available from 300 of 302 subjects in the RAP (deep 
sequencing from 294 with >1,000 × coverage at NS5B 282 position in 272 of 294 subjects; 
population sequencing from 6 subjects). The S282T substitution was detected in one subject 
who received SOF monotherapy, not in any of the remaining 299 subjects in the RAP with 
sequence data.  
There were other NS5B substitutions observed in samples from >2 subjects. These include, 
e.g., the L159F variant, which has also been shown to be selected by the investigational 
nucleotide analogue mericitabine, and which was enriched in two patients with on-treatment 
viral breakthrough in the pre-transplant setting, and the V321A variant. However, none of 
these substitutions were associated with a phenotypic change in SOF or RBV susceptibility, and 
their clinical relevance is unknown.  
Phenotypic data were successfully generated from these subjects in the RAP. No reduction in 
susceptibility to SOF or RBV was observed in HCV variants from 174 subjects. The sample from 
the 1 genotype 2b subject with S282T detected displayed a reduced susceptibility to SOF and a 
decreased replication capacity. S282T was no longer detectable at post-treatment Week 12 by 
deep sequencing with an assay cut-off of 1%, further indicative of the impaired replicative 
fitness of this variant. Of note, this patient, having first received monotherapy, was 
subsequently retreated with SOF+RBV for 12 weeks and achieved an SVR. 
A phylogenetic analysis was performed on NS5B sequences from subjects in 5 treatment groups 
of the four Phase 3 studies who either achieved SVR12 or failed to achieve SVR12. For 
genotype 2 or 3 responders and non-responders were intermingled within each 
genotype/subtype without any apparent clustering in any of the treatment groups. Thus, this 
analysis was not indicative of an unidentified viral factor determining whether SVR was reached 
or not reached in these patients. 
Activity against the less common genotypes (4-6) 
Although it is recognised that SOF has not been investigated against chimeric replicons or other 
viral expression vectors representing all described subgenotypes of HCV, available data are 
indicative of the pangenotypic activity of SOF. This includes both biochemical and cell-based 
assay IC50 and EC50 in the same range for all tested genotypes (1-4 and 1-6, respectively), as 
well as experiments on the selection of resistance, in which the S282T mutation is selected 
regardless of genotype. These preclinical findings are supported by the outcome of the clinical 
investigations.  
Similar, potent early on-treatment responses were seen in patients with genotypes 4-6 treated 
with SOF+PEG+RBV, compared to those seen in patients with genotypes 1-3. Further, to the 
extent that data are available, high SVR rates have been shown for patients with these 
genotypes.

Secondary pharmacology 
Thorough QT study 
Study P7977-0613, evaluating single dose therapeutic (400 mg) and supratherapeutic 
(1,200 mg) doses of SOF on the QTc interval in healthy subjects demonstrated a lack of effect 
of SOF on prolongation of the QTcF interval (primary PD endpoint) that was consistent with the 
ICH E14 definition of a negative thorough QT/QTc study. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Viral response has been shown to correlate both with sofosbuvir and GS-331007. However, as 
GS-331007 constitutes the major part of circulating and recovered radioactivity the applicant 
has based the interpretation of study results mainly on the exposure to GS-3310007. There is a 
concern that the exposure to GS-331007 cannot be considered a suitable surrogate marker for 
efficacy in all situations, e.g. in presence of drug-drug interactions and organ dysfunction which 
affect GS-331007 and sofosbuvir differently. A mechanistic understanding of the interrelation of 
SOF, GS-566500 and GS-331007 is lacking. This will be further investigated by the applicant 
post-authorisation as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
In pivotal clinical trials the recommendation has been to take SOF without regard to food. 
However, when combined with RBV, administration is in effect made in combination with a 
meal. This means that sofosbuvir was in fact taken with food in pivotal efficacy and safety 
trials. There are contradictory effects of a high fat meal on the PK of sofosbuvir, GS-566500 
and GS-331007 and the mechanism is not completely understood. Given the lack of 
mechanistic understanding, a clinically relevant effect cannot presently be excluded. Thus, the 
SmPC recommends to take SOF with food, in line with what has been de facto done in the 
pivotal trials. 
Although an in vitro signal of CYP3A4/CYP2B6 enzyme induction was established, this was not 
seen in vivo in a 7-day DDI study with oral contraceptives. Even though the study was 
somewhat short, it is unlikely that a clinically relevant induction effect would be the case, since 
after 7 days there were no signs of any decrease in exposure to norgestromine, norgestrel or 
ethinyl oestradiol. 
Safe use of SOF in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD has not been established and 
no dosing recommendation is available. Normalising the exposure of GS-331007 in patients 
with severe renal impairment would require 5- to 10-fold lower dose of SOF. This may lead to 
suboptimal treatment. Therefore, to facilitate the use of SOF in these patients, further clinical 
safety and efficacy data in this population is needed and will be obtained from a study 
performed by the applicant as an additional pharmacovigilance activity (study GS-US-334-
0154). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of SOF, GS-566500 and GS-331007 has been characterised in healthy volunteers and 
patients with HCV. The applicant has agreed to further investigate the clinical pharmacology of 
SOF as additional pharmacovigilance activities.

Note: Only treatment regimens and subject populations in the Phase 2 and 3 studies that are included to the 
submission are included. 
Note: Unless otherwise indicated, the dose of SOF was 400 mg once daily, the dose of RBV was 1000 or 1200 
mg/day (for subjects who weighed < 75 kg, the dose of RBV was 1000 mg/day in 2 divided doses and for 
subjects who weighed ≥ 75 kg, the RBV dose was 1200 mg/day in 2 divided doses), and the dose of PEG was 
180 μg weekly. 
Also, data from three other studies were submitted during the procedure. These are: 
•  study GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE), investigating treatment with SOF+RBV for 12-24 
weeks in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV-
infection  
•  study GS-US-334-0151 (LONESTAR 2), investigating treatment with SOF+PEG+RBV for 12 
weeks in treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection who failed 
prior interferon-based therapy 
• 
the retreatment protocol for patients in the QUANTUM trial 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The initial dose ranging of SOF was a 3-day monotherapy study in patients with genotype 1, 
using GS-9851, a 1:1 racemic mixture of SOF and a 6-8 fold lower potency diastereomer. After 
three days of dosing, with doses ranging from 50-400 mg q.d., the 400 mg dose showed the 
greatest decline in HCV-RNA: -1.952 log 10 IU/ml. 
Further dose-ranging was done with SOF. In the P7977-0221 study, performed in non-cirrhotic, 
treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1 infection, doses of 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg 
were given for 28 days in combination with PEG+RBV, followed by 44 weeks of PEG+RBV. 
SVR24 rates were 9/16 (56.3%), 15/18 (83.3%) and 12/15 (80%) in the respective arms. As 
SVR rates were lowest, and breakthrough (post SOF discontinuation) and relapse rates were 
highest in the SOF 100 mg+PEG+RBV group, SOF 200 mg+PEG+RBV and 400 mg+PEG+RBV 
were the therapeutic doses carried forward to be evaluated in Study P7977-0422 (PROTON) 
over a longer treatment duration. 
In the PROTON study, 122 treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic subjects with HCV genotype 1, 
stratified for Interleukin (IL) 28B status (C/C or any T allele) and baseline HCV-RNA levels 
(<800,000 IU/ml or ≥800,000 IU/ml) were randomised to receive SOF 200 mg once daily, 400 
mg once daily or matching placebo, together with PEG+RBV for 12 weeks.  HCV-infected 
subjects who achieved an eRVR (HCV-RNA < lower limit of detection [LOD] at Weeks 4 through 
12 inclusive) received an additional 12 weeks of PEG+RBV. Genotype 1 HCV-infected subjects 
who did not achieve an eRVR received an additional 36 weeks of PEG+RBV. 
SVR12 and SVR24 rates were approximately 90% in both SOF dosing groups (43/48 with 200 
mg; 43/47 with 400 mg). Virologic breakthroughs during treatment with PEG+RBV following 
treatment with SOF+PEG+RBV, however, were more common in the SOF 200 mg+PEG+RBV

group compared with the SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV group (3 subjects versus 0), suggesting that 
the SOF 400 mg dose may provide greater suppression of viral activity. There was no apparent 
difference in tolerability between 200 mg and 400 mg q.d. On this basis, the dose of 400 mg 
q.d was selected. 
The dose of RBV selected is weight-based, 1,000 or 1,200 mg/ day, in accordance with the RBV 
(Copegus) product information for genotype 1. The 11-I-0258 study used a lower dose, 600 
mg/day, in combination with SOF in genotype 1, as a comparison to this standard, which 
yielded lower SVR rates (see below). 
Regimen selection for Phase 3 
Genotype 1 
As stated above, in the PROTON study 12 weeks of SOF 400 mg q.d.+PEG+RBV in treatment-
naïve subjects with genotype 1 HCV-infection resulted in an SVR24 rate of 91.5% (43/47).  
Study P7977-0523 (ELECTRON) indicated that 12 weeks of SOF+RBV could effectively treat 
treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV-infected subjects, with an SVR12 rate of 84.0% (21/25); 
however the response rate among prior null responders (to interferon-based therapy) was a 
mere 10% (1/10). 
In Study P7977-0724 (ATOMIC), 12 weeks of SOF+PEG+RBV in treatment-naïve subjects with 
genotype 1, 4, or 6 HCV-infection resulted in an SVR12 rate of 90.4% (47/52). This high SVR 
rate, along with the simplicity of the 12-week PEG-containing regimen, supported initiation of 
the Phase 3 Study GS US-334-0110 (NEUTRINO) with SOF+PEG+RBV. 
Study P2938-0721 (QUANTUM) assessed 12 and 24 weeks of SOF+RBV treatment. In this 
study, 12 weeks of SOF+RBV was as effective as 24 weeks of SOF+RBV in achieving SVR12 - 
53% (10/19) and 47.0% (9/19), respectively in subjects with genotype 1 HCV-infection. 
The interferon-free combination of SOF+RBV was further studied in a National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored trial in genotype 1, which is discussed 
below, but was not investigated in any pivotal Phase 3 trial, presumably based on data from 
the ELECTRON and QUANTUM studies. It appears that the addition of another drug to SOF+RBV 
would be required to optimise the regimen in genotype 1.  
Genotypes 2 and 3 
In the PROTON study there was an arm with genotype 2/3 patients, all of whom received 12 
weeks of SOF 400 mg q.d.+PEG+RBV (800 mg q.d.). This resulted in an SVR12 rate of 92.0% 
(23/25).  
The ELECTRON study showed SVR12 of 100% in treatment-naive subjects with genotype 2 or 3 
HCV-infection, regardless of the presence or absence of PEG in the regimen (total N=50). 
Treatment with SOF monotherapy was less efficacious, resulting in 60.0% (6/10) of treatment-
naïve genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infected subjects achieving SVR12; thus, indicating that RBV should 
be included in the regimen. In the ELECTRON study, SOF+RBV provided a relatively high 
virologic response rate of 68.0% (17/25) SVR12 in treatment-experienced genotype 2 or 3 
HCV-infected subjects, a population with limited treatment options.

These data supported initiation of the Phase 3 studies P7977-1231 (FISSION), GS US 334-0107 
(POSITRON), and GS US 334 0108 (FUSION) with SOF+RBV. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Genotypes 1, 4, 5 and 6 
The company has conducted one Phase 3 study of SOF+PEG+RBV in treatment-naïve patients 
with genotype 1 infection (GS-US-334-0107, NEUTRINO). This study also included a few 
patients with the (in Europe, and particularly the US) less common genotype 4. Furthermore, it 
had some individuals with genotype 5 and -6 infection. These are very uncommon in the 
regions where the study was performed, and have been subject to little systematic study in 
previous HCV trials.  
Other, supportive, studies of relevance for the use of SOF in genotype 1 include the NIAID-
sponsored study termed 11-I-0258 (SPARE), the QUANTUM retreatment protocol, and GS-US-
334-0123 (PHOTON-1) in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, which are all further discussed below. 
Furthermore, it is worth noting that different treatment regimens including sofosbuvir are being 
investigated in a Janssen-Cilag-sponsored study termed HPC2002, for prior null responders to 
PEG+RBV, in combination with investigational NS3/4A inhibitor simeprevir, and a BMS-
sponsored study, AI444040, in combination with investigational NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir. 
GS-US-334-0110 (NEUTRINO) - Treatment-naïve subjects in subjects with genotype 
1, 4-6 
Methods 
NEUTRINO was a Phase 3, multicentre, single arm, open label study to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of sofosbuvir with PEG alfa-2a and RBV for 12 Weeks in treatment-naïve subjects 
with chronic genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 HCV-infection. 
Study Participants  
Subjects enrolled in this study had chronic genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 HCV-infection and were naïve 
to HCV antiviral treatment. Furthermore, patients needed to have compensated liver disease 
and platelets >90,000/µl (in accordance with the prescribing information for PEG alfa-2a), and 
were not allowed to have HBV or HIV co-infection. 
Treatments 
•  SOF was administered orally 400 mg/day, once daily (1 × 400-mg tablet) 
•  PEG was administered subcutaneously 180 µg/week, once weekly (180 µg, 
subcutaneous) 
•  RBV was administered orally 1,000 or 1,200 mg/day (5 or 6 × 200-mg tablets in a 
divided daily dose: 1,000 mg for subjects weighing < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for subjects 
weighing ≥75 kg) 
Treatment duration was 12 weeks.

Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of NEUTRINO was to determine the efficacy of treatment with 
SOF+PEG+RBV, as measured by the proportion of subjects with SVR12. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
•  SVR4 and SVR24 
•  absolute values and change from baseline in HCV-RNA during treatment and after 
treatment discontinuation 
•  emergence of viral resistance to SOF during treatment and after treatment 
discontinuation 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 300 subjects. A sample size of 300 subjects provided 90% 
power to detect a 9% improvement in SVR12 rate from 60% to 69% using a 2-sided one-
sample binomial test at a significance level of 0.05.  
Randomisation 
This study was not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label, single arm study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis assessed whether subjects who were administered 
SOF+PEG+RBV for 12 weeks achieved an SVR12 rate higher than 60%. The 95% CI on the 
SVR12 rates was constructed based on Clopper-Pearson exact method. The p-value associated 
with the test of superiority was demonstrated if the 2-sided one-sample exact test p-value was 
less than the 0.05 significance level.  
The basis for this 60% SVR null rate was derived from: 1) an historical SVR rate of 
approximately 65% calculated from the telaprevir (ADVANCE study) and boceprevir (SPRINT2 
study) data after adjusting for the targeted proportion of subjects with cirrhosis (approximately 
20%) in this study; and 2) a 5% trade-off in efficacy exchanged for an expected improved 
safety profile and shorter duration of treatment.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The study started on 18 June 2012 (first subject screened) and the last subject observation 
was on 16 April 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was not amended during the course of the study. 
A total of 80 important protocol deviations occurred in 66 subjects during the study. Of the 66 
subjects, 55 had a single important deviation, 8 subjects had 2 deviations, and 3 subjects had 
3 deviations. The majority of important protocol deviations (48 of 80) were for subjects not 
managed according to protocol-specified assessments or procedures. Of these 48 deviations, 29 
deviations were for study visits completed outside of the protocol-specified visit window. 
A total of 16 subjects violated at least 1 eligibility criterion. Half of the entry criteria violations 
(8 subjects) were due to subjects not having a liver biopsy when their Fibrotest and APRI 
scores were indeterminate. All of the violations due to not having a liver biopsy were identified 
after treatment commenced; these subjects were not discontinued from the study. 
According to the applicant none of the important protocol deviations affected the overall quality 
or interpretation of the study data. 
Baseline data 
The median age of participants was 54 years; 64% were male; 79% were white, 16.5% being

The difference in response rates between genotype 1a and 1b were approximately 10%, with 
higher rates in genotype 1a. Data from the PHOTON-1 and QUANTUM retreatment studies 
discussed below are indicative that this may represent a real difference in the antiviral activity 
of SOF against these subgenotypes. 
Of particular note, there were no on treatment virological failures, all virological failure being 
relapses (28 of 326 [8.6%] patients with EOT response). 
Concerning the less common genotypes, 96.4% (27 of 28) for those with HCV genotype 4, the 
single subject with genotype 5, and all 6 subjects with genotype 6 HCV-infection achieved 
SVR12.

Based on historical precedent and Phase 2 data indicative of roughly similar efficacy in 
genotypes 2 and -3, these genotypes were studied in the same Phase 3 trials (P7977-1231 
[FISSION]; GS-US-334-0107 [POSITRON]; GS-US-334-0108 [FUSION], where the efficacy of 
the interferon-free combination SOF+RBV was investigated. As these studies indicated that the 
efficacy is higher in genotype 2 and the required treatment duration longer in genotype 3, the 
outcomes of these studies are discussed below per genotype rather than per study.  
Furthermore, during the approval procedure, the applicant submitted supplemental data for 
study GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE). These serve to further illuminate the optimal use of 
SOF+RBV in genotype 2/3 subpopulations, and are discussed in the following insofar as they 
provide guidance on the optimal use of SOF+RBV in terms of treatment duration. 
P7977-1231 (FISSION): Treatment-naïve subjects infected with genotype 2/3 
Methods 
FISSION was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study to 
investigate the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir and RBV for 12 weeks compared to PEG and 
RBV for 24 weeks (present standard-of-care) in treatment-naïve patients with chronic genotype 
2 or 3 HCV-infection. 
Study Participants  
Eligible subjects had chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection, were naïve to HCV antiviral 
treatment, were either non-cirrhotic or had compensated cirrhosis. Albumin was required to be 
≥32 g/L. In cirrhotics, baseline platelet count needed to be >75,000/µl. Patients with HIV- or 
HBV-coinfection were excluded. 
Subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection were enrolled in an approximately 1:3 ratio. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomised to one of following treatment groups: 
•  SOF+RBV: SOF 400 mg + RBV 1,000 mg or 1,200 mg (based on baseline body weight 
below or above 75 kg) daily for 12 weeks 
•  PEG+RBV: PEG 180 μg weekly + RBV 800 mg daily for 24 weeks  
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of FISSION was to determine the efficacy of sofosbuvir in 
combination with RBV administered for 12 weeks compared with standard-of-care (PEG+RBV 
administered for 24 weeks) in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection as 
measured by the proportion of subjects with SVR12  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 52/100 
 
  
  
•  SVR24  
•  change in circulating HCV-RNA in subjects over 12 or 24 weeks of dosing 
•  proportion of subjects with HCV-RNA below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) and 
LOD at various time points throughout the study 
•  proportion of subjects whose ALT normalised during therapy 
•  virologic failure rate 
•  HCV drug resistance substitutions at baseline, during, and after therapy with SOF 
Sample size 
The planned sample size of 500 subjects (250 in each treatment group) was estimated to 
provide >95% power to establish noninferiority of SOF+RBV treatment relative to PEG+RBV 
treatment in the proportion of subjects with SVR12. For the sample size calculation, it was 
assumed that both the SOF+RBV and PEG+RBV groups had a response rate of 75%. The 
noninferiority margin was chosen 15%.  
A sample size of 250 per group would provide 93% power to detect a 12% difference in SVR12 
rates between the treatment groups (SOF+RBV and PEG+RBV group) using a 2-sided chi-
squared test and a significance level of 0.05 (assuming an SVR12 rate of 75% in the PEG+RBV 
group). 
Randomisation 
An interactive web response system (IWRS) randomly assigned subjects to receive SOF+RBV or 
PEG+RBV. Eligible subjects were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to SOF+RBV or PEG+RBV. 
The randomisation scheme was stratified by genotype (2 or 3), screening HCV-RNA level (<6 
log 10 IU/ml or ≥6 log 10 IU/ml), and cirrhosis (presence or absence). Subjects with mixed 
genotype 2/3 virus were to be randomised within the genotype 2 stratum.  
Blinding (masking) 
This study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Using a closed testing procedure, the noninferiority of SOF+RBV relative to PEG+RBV for 
SVR12 (primary efficacy endpoint) was tested first. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI on the difference in SVR12 rates (SOF+RBV group minus 
PEG+RBV group) was >–15%. For the assessment of non-inferiority the estimate and 95% CI 
on the difference between groups in SVR12 rates was constructed based on stratum-adjusted 
Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportions. 
If noninferiority was established, then the superiority of SOF+RBV relative to PEG+RBV was 
tested using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test statistic for stratified proportions. 
Superiority was demonstrated if the 2-sided p-value associated with the test of superiority was 
<0.05.

The proportion of subjects (and 95% exact CIs calculated with the Clopper-Pearson method) 
with HCV-RNA below LLOQ and with ALT normalisation were presented by treatment group and 
visit. Estimates and 95% CIs on the difference between treatment groups at each visit for these 
secondary efficacy endpoints were constructed based on stratum-adjusted MH proportions. The 
median time to first HCV-RNA measurement <LLOQ and <LLOQ target not detected (TND) was 
assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Summary statistics were presented for HCV-RNA and 
change from baseline in HCV-RNA by visit through Week 12.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The study started on 19 December 2011 (first subject screened) and the last subject 
observation was on 8 April 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol (12 July 2011) was amended 4 times (Amendment 1, dated 14 
September 2011; Amendment 1, Version 2, dated 16 September 2011; Amendment 2, dated 
26 October 2011; Amendment 2.1, dated 07 February 2012; Amendment 3, dated 07 February 
2012; Amendment 4, dated 18 June 2012). These changes were not of a nature to affect the 
integrity of the study. 
A total of 137 important protocol deviations occurred in 112 subjects during the study. Of the 
112 subjects, 92 had a single important deviation, 16 had 2 deviations, 3 had 3 deviations, and 
1 had 4 deviations. The majority of important protocol deviations (99 of 137) were for subjects

not managed according to protocol assessments or procedures. Of these 99 deviations, 48 
deviations were for study visits not completed. 34 deviations were for post-treatment Week 12 
(SVR12) study visits completed outside the protocol-specified visit window. 17 deviations were 
for study assessments that were not completed during visits, including collection of HCV-RNA 
sequencing samples and conducting pregnancy tests. Relevant protocol deviations were 
proportionally distributed between treatment arms and study centres. 
A total of 14 subjects violated 1 eligibility criterion. The majority of entry criteria violations 
were due to indeterminate liver cirrhosis assessments for subjects at the Day 1 visit date. All of 
the violations were identified after treatment commenced. Subjects did not have any other 
HCV-defining condition and were not discontinued from the study. Additionally, 24 subjects 
received prohibited concomitant medications within the 28 day period prior to first dose of 
study medication and/or while on treatment. 
According to the applicant none of these important protocol deviations affected the overall 
quality or interpretation of the study data. 
Baseline data 
The mean age was 50 years (range of 19 to 77 years). Most subjects (65.5%) were male, most 
were white (87.2%), non-Hispanic or Latino (85.6%), with Asian and black/African American 
subjects comprising 5.8% and 3.4% of subjects, respectively. The mean baseline body mass 
index (BMI) was 28.0 kg/m2, and most subjects (70.3%) had BMI <30 kg/m2 at baseline.  
Genotype 3 was the most prevalent HCV genotype (359/499 subjects [71.9%]). Overall, 137 
subjects (27.5%) had genotype 2 HCV-infection. Treatment groups were balanced with respect 
to the proportion of subjects with genotype 2 HCV-infection or genotype 3 HCV-infection.  
Three subjects (all in the SOF+RBV group) had genotype 1 HCV-infection as assessed by 
population sequencing, i.e. the screening genotype assessment by Lipa assay was inaccurate. 
No subject had mixed genotype 2/3 HCV-infection, and most subjects (79.8%) did not have 
cirrhosis at baseline. 
Treatment groups also were balanced with respect to the prevalence of IL28B genotype CC 
allele (SOF+RBV 42.5%, 108 subjects; PEG+RBV 43.8%, 106 subjects). In the SOF+RBV 
group, 121 subjects (47.6%) had the IL28B genotype CT allele and 25 subjects (9.8%) had the 
IL28B genotype TT. In the PEG+RBV group, 98 subjects (40.5%) had the IL28B genotype CT 
allele and 38 subjects (15.7%) had the IL28B genotype TT allele.  
Overall, 214 subjects (42.9%) had baseline HCV-RNA <6 log 10 IU/ml (SOF+RBV 42.2%, 108 
subjects, PEG+RBV 43.6%, 106 subjects), and 285 subjects (57.1%) had baseline HCV-RNA ≥6 
log 10 IU/ml (SOF+RBV 57.8%, 148 subjects, PEG+RBV 56.4%, 137 subjects). The mean 
baseline HCV-RNA was 6.0 log 10 IU/ml.  
Numbers analysed 
• Randomised analysis set: 527 subjects (263 SOF+RBV; 264 PEG+RBV) 
• Safety analysis set: 499 subjects (256 SOF+RBV; 243 PEG+RBV) 
• Full analysis set (FAS): 496 subjects (253 SOF+RBV; 243 PEG+RBV) 
Assessment report

Page 55/100 
 
  
  
• Per protocol analysis set: 477 subjects (246 SOF+RBV; 231 PEG+RBV) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The SVR12 rate in the SOF+RBV group was 66.8% (171/256; 95% CI: 60.7% to 72.5%), 
which was noninferior to the SVR12 rate in of 66.7% (162/243; 95% CI: 60.4% to 72.6%) in 
the PEG+RBV group. The strata-adjusted difference (95% CI) in proportions was 0.3% (-7.5% 
to 8.0%). The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between groups (ie, 
SOF+RBV − PEG+RBV) was greater than the pre-specified noninferiority margin of -15%. 
See below for a discussion of FISSION, POSITRON and FUSION by genotype.  
GS-US-334-0107 (POSITRON): Subjects who were interferon-intolerant, interferon-
ineligible, or unwilling to take interferon 
Methods 
POSITRON was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir + RBV for 12 weeks in subjects with chronic 
genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection who are interferon-intolerant, interferon-ineligible or unwilling to 
take interferon 
Study Participants  
For inclusion, patients were required to have chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection. Patients 
were also to be interferon-intolerant, interferon-ineligible, or unwilling to take interferon. 
Patients had to have platelets >25,000/µl, albumin >30 g/L and no history of clinical hepatic 
decompensation events. HIV- or HBV-coinfection were exclusion criteria. 
Interferon unwilling was defined as subject having medical records documenting his/her 
decision to decline treatment with an interferon-based regimen ≥ 3 months prior to signing the 
informed consent. 
Interferon ineligible was defined as subject being considered ineligible by the investigator for 
treatment with interferon due to at least one of several protocol-specified comorbidities that 
was deemed at risk for worsening with interferon treatment. 
Interferon intolerant was defined as subject having completed ≤12 weeks of treatment (ending 
≥3 months prior to screening) with interferon and discontinued treatment due to development 
or significant worsening of at least one of several protocol-specified conditions. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomised to one of the following two groups: 
•  SOF 400 mg administered once daily + RBV total daily dose of 1,000 to 1,200 mg 
(weight-based) administered in a divided daily dose 
•  SOF placebo administered once daily + RBV placebo administered in a divided daily dose 
The treatment duration was 12 weeks.  
Assessment report

Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of POSITRON was to determine the efficacy of treatment with 
sofosbuvir+RBV compared to treatment with placebo, as measured by the proportion of 
subjects with SVR12. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were as following: 
•  SVR4 and SVR24 
•  kinetics of HCV-RNA during treatment and after treatment discontinuation 
•  emergence of viral resistance to SOF during treatment and after treatment discontinuation 
Sample size 
A sample size of 180 subjects in the active group and 60 subjects in the placebo group 
provided 99% power to detect a 40% difference between group SVR12 rates using a 2-sided 
continuity-corrected chi-square test at a significance level of 0.05. 
Randomisation 
An interactive web response system (IWRS) randomly assigned subjects to receive SOF+RBV or 
placebo. Eligible subjects were allocated in a 3:1 ratio to SOF+RBV or placebo. 
The randomisation scheme was stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind placebo-controlled study. SOF and RBV placebo tablets were identical in 
appearance, shape, and size, and packaged identically, as the SOF 400-mg tablets and RBV 
200 mg tablets, respectively.  
Investigators and the sponsor were blinded to HCV-RNA results except at screening. Following 
the post-treatment Week 4 visit and after completion of al case report forms (CRFs), subjects 
were informed if they were eligible for the open-label study (GS-US-334-0109). 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis assessed whether in the full analysis set (subjects with chronic 
genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study 
drug) the proportion of subjects with SVR12 who received SOF+RBV was superior to the 
proportion of subjects with SVR12 who received placebo. The SVR12 rates between the 
SOF+RBV and placebo groups were compared using a CMH test stratified by the absence or 
presence of cirrhosis. Superiority was demonstrated if the 2-sided CMH p-value associated with 
the test of superiority was <0.05. 
The difference in SVR12 rates between groups and associated 95% CI were calculated based on 
stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel proportions. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess

the relationship between the primary efficacy endpoint and baseline demographic and disease 
characteristics. Point estimates and 95% exact CIs of the SVR12 rates for each treatment 
group, and of the difference (SOF+RBV – placebo) in SVR12 rates were displayed for each 
subgroup. Forest plots graphically provided the estimates and 95% CIs of the treatment 
differences in SVR12 rates for each subgroup.

There was 1 invalid administration of study drugs. The site dispensed the incorrect SOF placebo 
bottle to a subject at the Week 4 visit; the subject was randomised to receive SOF placebo, 
therefore the subject received study drug per the protocol. 
According to the applicant none of these important protocol deviations affected the overall 
quality or interpretation of the study data. 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in the safety analysis set were male (54%), white (91.4%), non-
Hispanic/Latinos (89.2%), with a mean age of 54 years (range: 21 to 75 years). Approximately 
two-thirds (66.5%) of subjects had a BMI <30 kg/m2. 
Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 groups. The study 
population had similar proportions of genotype 2 and 3 HCV-infected subjects (51.4% and 
48.6%, respectively) with 43.5%, 9.0%, and 47.5% classified as interferon-ineligible, 
interferon-intolerant and interferon-unwilling, respectively. The overall mean baseline HCV-RNA 
value for subjects was 6.3 log 10 IU/ml and a majority (69.8%) had a baseline HCV-RNA ≥ 6 
log 10 IU/ml. The majority of subjects had no prior HCV treatment (81.3%) and 8.3% of 
subjects had failed > 12 weeks prior treatment with an interferon-based regimen. Almost half 
of the subjects had the IL28B CC allele (45.3%). More than half of subjects had baseline ALT 
>1.5 × ULN [upper limit of the normal range] (57.2%) compared with baseline ALT ≤ 1.5 × 
ULN (42.8%). Approximately 16% of subjects had cirrhosis. 
Demographics were generally balanced across genotype 2 and genotype 3 subjects. 
Numbers analysed 
278 subjects (207 SOF+RBV subjects and 71 placebo subjects) 
Outcomes and estimation 
Overall, a statistically significant proportion of subjects in the SOF+RBV group achieved SVR12 
(161/207 [77.8%]; CI: 71.5% to 83.2%) compared with placebo, for which the SVR rate was, 
as expected, 0% (0/71; CI: 0.0% to 5.1%) (p<0.001).

GS-US-334-0108 (FUSION): Treatment-experienced subjects 
Methods 
FUSION was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double blind study to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of sofosbuvir + RBV for 12 or 16 Weeks in subjects with chronic genotype 2 or 3 
HCV-infection who had failed prior treatment with an interferon-based regimen. 
Study Participants  
Eligible subjects had chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection and had failed prior treatment 
with an interferon-based regimen. Patients had to have platelets >50,000/µl and albumin ≥30 
g/L, and have no history of clinical hepatic decompensation. Also, patients could not have

HIV- or HBV-coinfection. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomised to one of the following two treatment groups: 
•  SOF+RBV 12 Week group: SOF 400 mg administered once daily + RBV total daily dose of 
1,000 or 1,200 mg (weight-based) administered in a divided daily dose for 12 weeks; 
followed by SOF placebo administered once daily + RBV placebo administered in a divided 
daily dose for 4 weeks 
•  SOF+RBV 16 Week group: SOF 400 mg administered once daily + RBV total daily dose of 
1,000 or 1,200 mg (weight-based) administered in a divided daily dose for 16 weeks 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of FUSION was to determine the efficacy of treatment with 
SOF+RBV in each treatment group as measured by the proportion of subjects with SVR12 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of this study were as follows: 
•  SVR4 and SVR24 
•  kinetics of HCV-RNA during treatment and after treatment discontinuation  
•  emergence of viral resistance to SOF during treatment and after treatment 
discontinuation  
Sample size 
A sample size of 100 subjects in each group provided over 97% power to detect at least a 
20% improvement in the SVR12 rate from the assumed null rate of 25% using a 2-sided, 
exact, 1-sample, binomial test at a significance level of 0.025. In addition, this sample size 
also provided 82% power to detect a difference of 20% in SVR12 rates (50% vs 70%) 
between the 12- and 16-week treatment groups. 
Randomisation 
An interactive web response system (IWRS) randomised subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either the 
SOB+RBV 12-week group or the SOF+RBV 16-week group. 
Randomisation was stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis and HCV genotype (2 or 
3) at screening.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a randomised, double-blind study. Sofosbuvir was provided as a 400-mg tablet. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 60/100 
 
  
  
SOF placebo and RBV placebo tablets were identical in appearance, shape, and size, asn 
packaged identically as the SOF 400 mg tablets and RBV 200 mg tablets, respectively.  
Investigators and the sponsor (except for employees responsible for selection of virologic 
samples for sequencing and analyses) were blinded to HCV-RNA results except at screening. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with SVR12 in the full analysis set 
(all subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infection who were randomised and received at least 1 
dose of study drug).  
The 2 primary statistical hypotheses of the study were that the SVR12 rates in both treatment 
groups were higher than 25%. The 2-sided, exact, 1-sample binomial test was used to test the 
statistical hypotheses. The 2-sided 95% exact CI using the Clopper-Pearson method was 
provided for the SVR12 rate in each of the 2 treatment groups. If the tests in the primary 
analysis were statistically significant at the 0.025 significance level, the secondary analysis 
comparing the SVR12 rates between the 2 treatment groups was performed using a CMH test 
stratified by the randomisation stratification factors (ie, presence or absence of cirrhosis; 
genotype 2 or 3). The 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in SVR12 rates between the 2 
treatment groups (SOF+RBV 12 Week group − SOF+RBV 16 Week group) was constructed 
based on stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel proportions. Point estimates and 2-sided 95% 
exact CIs for the SVR12 rates were constructed for each demographic and baseline 
characteristic subgroup using the same methods described above.  
Forest plots graphically presented estimates and 95% CIs of the between-treatment group 
differences in SVR12 rates for each subgroup.

Recruitment 
The study started on 04 June 2012 (first subject screened) and the last subject observation 
was on 08 May 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The original clinical study protocol (dated 29 March 2012) was amended once (Protocol 
Amendment 1, dated 07 May 2012), before any subject entered screening.  
Two administrative letters were issued (dated 16 May 2012 and 28 August 2012).  
A total of 36 important protocol deviations occurred in 29 subjects during the study. Of the 29 
subjects, 22 subjects had a single important deviation and 7 subjects had 2 important 
deviations. The majority of important protocol deviations (22 of 36) were for subjects not 
managed according to protocol-specified assessments or procedures. Of these 22 deviations, 13 
deviations were for study visits not completed. Relevant protocol deviations were proportionally 
distributed between treatment groups and study centres. 
A total of 6 subjects violated 1 eligibility criteria. The majority of entry criteria violations (3 
subjects) were due to subjects not having liver imaging completed within 6 months of Day 1

(baseline). All of the violations were identified after treatment commenced; these subjects did 
not have any other HCV-defining condition and were not discontinued from the study. 
A total of 3 subjects had invalid study drugs administered. All were in the SOF + RBV 12-week 
group and erroneously received RBV monotherapy from week 12 to week 16 (2 subjects) or 
day 96 (one subject).  
According to the applicant none of these important protocol deviations affected the overall 
quality or interpretation of the study data. 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in the safety analysis set were male (69.7%), white (86.6%), and 
non-Hispanic/Latino (90.5%), with a mean age of 56 years (ranging from 24 to 70 years). The 
overall mean baseline BMI value for subjects was 28.5 kg/m2. 
The majority of subjects (63.2%) in the safety analysis set had genotype 3 HCV-infection, 
33.8% had genotype 2 HCV-infection, and 3.0% had genotype 1 HCV-infection. The overall 
mean baseline HCV-RNA value for subjects was 6.5 log 10 IU/ml, and most subjects (72.6%) 
had baseline HCV-RNA ≥6 log 10 IU/ml. The type of prior treatment failure with interferon-based 
regimen(s) was relapse/breakthrough in 75.1% of subjects and nonresponse in 24.9% of 
subjects. The majority of subjects (69.7%) had non-CC (CT or TT) IL28B alleles. Overall, 
34.0% of subjects had cirrhosis. The mean baseline ALT value was 91 U/L, and most subjects 
(59.2%) had baseline ALT values >1.5 × ULN. Overall, the mean baseline estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation was 115.1 ml/min. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two treatment 
groups and also across subjects with genotype 2 and genotype 3 HCV-infection. 
Numbers analysed 
•  Randomised analysis set: 202 subjects (103 subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group 
and 99 subjects in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group) 
•  Safety analysis set: 201 subjects (103 subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and 98 
subjects in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group) 
• 
Full analysis set: 195 subjects (100 subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and 95 
subjects in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group) 
Outcomes and estimation 
A total of 49.5% of subjects (51 of 103) in the SOF+RBV 12-week group and 71.4% of subjects 
(70 of 98) in the SOF+RBV 16-week group achieved SVR12. The SVR12 rates in the SOF+RBV 
12-Week group and in the SOF+RBV 16-Week group were each statistically significantly higher 
(p<0.001) compared to the null rate of 25%. The difference in the percentage of subjects who 
achieved SVR12 between the 2 treatment groups was -22% (95% CI: -35% to -9%) in favour 
of the SOF+RBV 16-week group. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001).

Results of the Phase 3 studies in genotypes 2/3 
The outcomes for the active treatment arms across trials are summarised in table 9 below. 
Of note, among patients treated with SOF+RBV, all cases of virological failure but one were 
relapses. The single patient with on treatment virological breakthrough had plasma PK 
parameters compatible with non-compliance.

Analysis of genotype 2 response 
Overall responses in genotype 2 with SOF+RBV 12 weeks were 95% in a treatment-naïve 
population and 93% in the interferon-ineligible/intolerant/unwilling population. This is 
Assessment report

statistically significantly higher than the 78% reached in the PEG+RBV control arm. Among 
treatment-experienced patients, the response rate was 82% with 12 weeks of therapy and 89% 
with 16 weeks. There was no significant impact of age or sex. In treatment-naïve or interferon-
ineligible/intolerant/unwilling, the small number of cirrhotics seemed to do as well as those 
without cirrhosis (whereas this was not the case in the FISSION PEG+RBV control arm).  
In the treatment-experienced population, baseline viraemia categories and IL28B genotype did 
not have any clear impact on responses. Responses in cirrhotics were lower than in non-
cirrhotics, with 6/10 and 7/9 patients achieving SVR in the 12 and 16 week arm, respectively. 
Emerging data from study GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE), where patients with genotype 2 were 
treated with SOF+PEG for 12 weeks showed high responses in treatment-experienced patients: 
37/41 patients (90.2%) achieved SVR. This included 9/10 patients with prior non-response (as 
opposed to relapse) and 7/8 patients with cirrhosis. 
Analysis of genotype 3 response 
Overall, response rates in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 3 given 12 weeks of 
SOF+RBV bitherapy were 56-61%. Cirrhosis was a strong predictor of response, with 
approximately halved rates of SVR in the 12-week arms of the trials, as well as in the PEG+RBV 
control arm of the FISSION study. Notably, there was no difference in SVR rates in cirrhotics 
and non-cirrhotics among treatment-experienced patients treated for 16 weeks in the FUSION 
study. In the treatment-experienced population, response with 12 weeks of treatment was 
30%, and with 16 weeks of treatment was 62% - that is, similar to what was seen in a 
treatment-naïve population.  
Emerging results from the VALENCE study, where after a protocol amendment all patients with 
genotype 3 were given 24 weeks of therapy, were submitted during the application procedure. 
Outcomes were as follows:

These data demonstrate that increasing treatment duration with SOF+RBV bitherapy to 24 
weeks in genotype 3 is associated with a considerable increase in SVR rates, with 90% SVR 
rates seen in treatment-naïve patients, including a similar rate in a small subset of cirrhotics. 
In the treatment-experienced population, enriched for poor interferon responders, cirrhotics 
still had relatively low SVR rates (60%).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Efficacy of sofosbuvir in liver transplantation (Study P7977-2025) 
For Study P7977-2025, the primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of subjects with pTVR 
(post-transplant virologic response; defined as HCV-RNA <LLOQ at Week 12 after transplant). 
An interim analysis was conducted on 61 subjects (genotypes 1 through 4) who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. 
This is a predominantly white, male cohort with a mean age of 59, 75% of whom have 
experience of prior therapy. Approximately 70% have genotype 1 infection, the remaining 30% 
being mostly genotype 2 and -3. Seventeen (28%) patients had Child-Pugh B status at 
baseline. 
A total of 93.1% (54 of 58) of subjects had HCV-RNA <LLOQ by Week 4 of SOF+RBV 
treatment. With the exception of 5 subjects who had on-treatment virologic failures, all 
subjects had HCV-RNA <LLOQ for the duration of treatment or until the time of liver 
transplantation, whichever occurred first. 
To date, 44 subjects underwent liver transplantation following up to 48 weeks of treatment with 
SOF/RBV. Of these, 41 had HCV-RNA <LLOQ at the time of transplantation. Of these 41 
subjects, 37 have reached 12 weeks post-transplant, and 23 of these (62.2%) have achieved 
pTVR. No relapse has hitherto been observed after week 12, with 21/23 patients achieving 
pTVR having reached week 24 post-transplant, and 5/23 patients having reached week 48. Of 
the 14 patients who had HCV-RNA <LLOQ at the time of transplantation but did not reach 
pTVR, 10 had recurrence of HCV, 3 died immediately post-transplant (4-14 days) and 1 patient 
withdrew consent with HCV-RNA <LLOQ.  
Among the 5 patients with virological failure (pre-transplant), an enrichment of the L159V viral 
variant was seen in two. As this variant was not the dominant quasispecies at the time of 
measurement, and does not clearly confer phenotypic resistance to SOF, it is unclear whether 
this was the cause of virological failure.  
Of note, 11/15 patients discontinuing therapy at 24 weeks (in the absence of transplantation) 
according to the original protocol relapsed; thus, patients are being treated for 48 weeks 
according to a protocol amendment. Seven patients retreated after relapse have been reported, 
all of whom have shown durable virological suppression.  
Time with plasma HCV-RNA <LLOQ TND at the time of transplant was a stronger predictor of 
graft protection against reinfection than was time <LLOQ (which includes also time when HCV-
RNA was detected below the level of quantification) or time on treatment.  
Child-Pugh classification at baseline did not impact the likelihood of graft protection. Patients 
with genotype 1 had lower levels of graft protection than those with genotype non-1, but the 
sample size is presently too small to determine whether viral genotype is an independent 
predictor of graft protection. 
Efficacy of sofosbuvir in HCV/HIV co-infection: GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1) 
This is an ongoing open-label, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
SOF+RBV in subjects with chronic genotype 1, 2, or 3 HCV-infection and HIV-1 coinfection, 
Assessment report

including patients with compensated cirrhosis. Treatment-naïve patients with genotypes 2 and 
3 were treated for 12 weeks. Treatment-experienced patients with genotypes 2 and 3 received 
24 weeks of therapy, as did treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1. Most patients in the 
study were receiving antiretroviral therapy. 
Among patients with genotype 1 treated with SOF+RBV, 87/114 (76.3%) of patients with 
genotype 1 achieved SVR12 (including 3/5 cirrhotics). A large difference in response between 
genotype 1a and 1b is notable – 82.2% (74/90) of patients with genotype 1a reached SVR 
versus 54.2% (13/24) of patients with genotype 1b. 
Treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with genotype 2, treated for 12 and 24 
weeks respectively, reached SVR12 rates of 88.5% (23/26) and 93.3% (14/15), respectively.  
Treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with genotype 3, treated for 12 and 24 
weeks respectively, reached SVR12 rates of 66.7% (28/42) and 92.3% (12/13) respectively. 
Supportive studies 
Efficacy of a PEG-free bitherapy regimen 
The efficacy of an interferon-free bitherapy regimen with SOF+RBV was investigated in 
HCV/HIV-coinfected subjects (PHOTON-1; see above), an NIAID-sponsored trial (study 11-I-
0258) as well as in the retreatment protocol of the QUANTUM study: 
Study 11-I-0258 (SPARE) 
This NIAID-sponsored study, which included a total of 60 patients, demonstrated that SOF in 
combination with weight-based RBV (1,000 or 1,200 mg/day), without PEG, resulted in an 
SVR12 rate of 68.0% in genotype 1 HCV-infected subjects with a high proportion of 
traditionally negative predictors for treatment outcome. This study also demonstrated that SOF 
in combination with a reduced dose of RBV (600 mg/day) resulted in a lower SVR12 rate 
(48.0%) compared with SOF in combination with weight-based RBV.  
The QUANTUM retreatment protocol 
The QUANTUM study was originally designed to evaluate monotherapy with the nucleotide RNA 
polymerase inhibitor GS-0938 300 mg and combinations of GS-0938 300 mg and SOF 400 mg 
with or without RBV. Due to a hepatotoxicity signal related to GS-0938, all subjects who were 
randomised to a regimen containing GS-0938 or to placebo were required to discontinue all 
treatment prior to the planned end of therapy. Subjects in some of the treatment arms had 
been exposed to sofosbuvir for a varying duration; others had been exposed to GS-0938, with 
or without RBV, or to placebo.  
Among 105 patients with genotype 1 subsequently treated for 24 weeks with SOF + RBV 57/80 
(71.3%) of genotype 1a patients reached SVR, compared to 12/25 (48%) of genotype 1b 
patients. Furthermore, among 71 patients that had had prior exposure to sofosbuvir (2-8 
weeks), and thus potential preselection of less sensitive variants, the response rate was 48/71 
(67.6%), which is similar to that seen in patients without previous exposure to SOF. There was 
no impact of duration of SOF exposure on the likelihood of response on retreatment.

Other studies 
Sofosbuvir in combination with other DAAs  
Different treatment regimens including sofosbuvir are being investigated in a Janssen-Cilag-
sponsored study termed HPC2002, for prior null responders to PEG+RBV, in combination with 
investigational NS3/4A inhibitor simeprevir, and a BMS-sponsored study, AI444040, in 
combination with investigational NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir. 
Results from these studies12 indicate that SVR rates close to 100% can be reached when a 
further potent DAA is combined with SOF, even in patients with a history of treatment failure 
on boceprevir- or telaprevir-based triple therapy (study AI444040). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The particular characteristics of SOF among DAAs against hepatitis C 
SOF is a novel nucleotide HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor. Available data support pangenotypic 
activity. The functional barrier to resistance is very high, as evidenced by the fact that viral 
breakthrough on therapy is rare, and has hitherto not clearly been shown to be caused by the 
selection of resistant variants. Furthermore, in patients relapsing after combination therapy 
with SOF, no phenotypic resistance to SOF has been detected. Available data, though scarce, 
indicate that durable viral resuppression may be reached on retreatment. 
These characteristics make SOF unique as a new backbone for hepatitis C therapy.  
In clinical trials of various sizes in the most common HCV genotype, genotype 1, increased 
efficacy has been indicated when SOF+/- RBV is combined with a NS3/4A inhibitor, an NS5A 
inhibitor, a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor or an interferon. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose and regimen selection for Phase 3 
The dose of SOF was selected on the basis of dose-ranging trials against a background of 
PEG+RBV, as has generally been the practice for drugs presently in development in Phase 3 in 
interferon-free regimens. Data support that the selected dose is maximally or near-maximally 
effective.  
The dose of supportive RBV (1,000/1,200 mg depending on whether body weight is below or 
above 75 kg) is similar to that recommended according to labeling for the use against genotype 
1 virus in combination with an interferon. Apart from a small study where this dose was more

effective than a low dose (600 mg), no systematic dose ranging of RBV in the present context 
has been performed.  
Regimen selection for the pivotal trials was based on the outcomes of the Phase 2 program, 
primarily the ATOMIC and ELECTRON trials.  
Design of the pivotal clinical studies 
For genotype 1, the NEUTRINO study was uncontrolled, and thus not conducted according to 
CHMP guidelines. However, the subjects’ baseline characteristics were comparable or indeed 
less favourable than in the pivotal trials for telaprevir and boceprevir (ADVANCE and SPRINT-2) 
in a similar population. 
As is well-known, interferons have a complicated side effects profile which makes them 
unsuitable for a considerable proportion of patients with HCV, and they are contraindicated in 
patients with decompensated liver disease. Drug development is presently focused on 
interferon-free regimens. Thus, the reason for this small study program with SOF in 
combination with PEG+RBV is the general recognition that the era of interferon-based HCV 
treatment is at its end. There is no regulatory impetus to demand further studies of SOF in 
combination with interferon. 
In accordance with historical precedent as well as regulatory advice, and supported by Phase 2 
results, patients with genotype 3 virus infection were studied in the same trials as genotype 2. 
Results, however, indicate a clear difference in responses with 12 weeks of treatment (see 
below). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The scope of the efficacy demonstration 
The Phase 3 program for SOF contains one uncontrolled study of SOF+PEG+RBV for 12 weeks 
in treatment-naïve patients  with genotype 1-infection and compensated liver disease 
(NEUTRINO); one randomised controlled non-inferiority study comparing 12 weeks of SOF+RBV 
with 24 weeks of PEG+RBV (present standard-of-care) in treatment-naïve patients with 
genotype 2 or -3 infection and compensated liver disease (FISSION); one randomised placebo-
controlled study of SOF+RBV for 12 weeks in patients with genotype 2 or -3 infection deemed 
ineligible, intolerant or unwilling to take an interferon (POSITRON); and one randomised 
controlled comparison of SOF+RBV for 12 or 16 weeks in treatment-experienced patients with 
genotype -2 or -3 infection and compensated liver disease (FUSION). Furthermore, data from 
the VALENCE study, performed in treatment naïve and -experienced patients with genotypes 2 
and 3, and from the PHOTON-1 study, performed in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with 
genotypes 1-3, contribute to the definition of appropriate treatment regimens. 
Important supportive studies on the use of SOF in interferon-free regimens include: the NIAID-
sponsored 11-I-0258 study in which SOF+RBV, the latter at standard or low dose, was given 
for 24 weeks to treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 infection, and the PHOTON-1 study, 
which demonstrates that HIV co-infection does not seem to greatly impact response to 
sofosbuvir-based interferon-free therapy. 
The dossier also contains interim results from the P7977-2025 study. This is a single arm study 
of SOF+RBV where patients with various genotypes and treatment experience, that have

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are waiting for transplantation, are treated with SOF+RBV 
until transplantation or for 24 weeks, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome measure is 
prevention of graft reinfection. 
Efficacy against genotype 1 
In the NEUTRINO study, results with 12 weeks of SOF+PEG+RBV were approximately 90% SVR 
in the full population, and about 80% in patients with compensated cirrhosis. These results are 
indicative of a near-maximally efficacious regimen in treatment naïve non-cirrhotic patients 
with genotype 1. Available evidence from other regimens indicates that cirrhotics in general 
may benefit from a longer duration of therapy than non-cirrhotics. Though the SVR rate in 
cirrhotics is greater than was seen in ADVANCE or SPRINT-2, it remains possible that adding 
one or more months of therapy might create a further increment in responses, as therapy was 
generally almost surprisingly well tolerated. Also, while it is recognised that potential PEG-RBV 
“non-responders” comprise approximately half of a typical treatment-naïve genotype 1 
population, it is possible that patients with very low response to PEG (“null responders”) may 
benefit from longer treatment duration; such patients have not been identified and 
systematically studied with this regimen. 
Due to the number of patients with an urgent unmet need of therapy, who do not tolerate 
interferon, it is anticipated that there will be a considerable use in genotype 1 of SOF in 
interferon-free combinations subsequent to an approval. Studies of SOF in combination with the 
investigational NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV, GS-5885), for the treatment of genotype 1 
infection are ongoing, but results are not yet available. The application dossier, however, 
contains a few studies of importance for the potential use of SOF without an interferon in 
genotype 1 infection. The QUANTUM and 11-I-0258 studies indicated that 24 weeks of 
SOF+RBV bitherapy may yield SVR rates in the range of 50-70%, which would make this an 
inoptimised, but by no means inefficient regimen; in fact, point estimates are higher than 
generally seen with PEG+RBV in the treatment of genotype 1 for 48 weeks. This conclusion is 
corroborated by findings from the PHOTON-1 study, the first larger study of an interferon-free 
regimen in patients with HCV/HIV-coinfection. With an SVR rate of 76% in 114 patients with 
HIV-HCV-coinfection, its outcomes are indicative that coinfected patients may respond similarly 
well as monoinfected patients to such regimens. 
A finding of interest in the PHOTON-1 study is a considerably higher response rate in genotype 
1a compared to -1b. The QUANTUM retreatment study revealed a similar finding. A smaller 
difference in response rates in favour of genotype 1a was seen in NEUTRINO, where PEG was 
included in the regimen. The virological reason for this difference is unclear; hypotheses include 
a 2.75-fold higher EC50 in genotype 1b versus -1a in the replicon system, as well as a higher 
frequency of the L159F polymorphism in genotype 1b, which is selected by SOF drug pressure 
and therefore might impact response. However, given the small difference in EC50 between 
genotypes, and the fact that the L159F polymorphism at baseline apparently did not impact 
response, the reason for this finding remains unclear.   
Finally, it is worth noting that treatment regimens including sofosbuvir in combination with 
other investigational DAAs are currently being investigated in clinical trials. As discussed above, 
results to date indicate that SVR rates close to 100% can be reached when a further potent 
DAA is combined with SOF, even in patients with a history of treatment failure on boceprevir- 
Assessment report

Page 75/100 
 
  
  
or telaprevir-based triple therapy (BMS-sponsored study AI444040). There is little doubt that 
these studies are representative of the treatment paradigm that is likely to guide clinical use of 
SOF, as other DAAs are approved.  
Efficacy against genotype 2 
Overall, responses in genotype 2 with SOF+RBV 12 weeks were 95% in a treatment-naïve 
population and 93% in the interferon-ineligible/intolerant/unwilling population. This is 
statistically significantly higher than the 78% reached in the PEG+RBV control arm. Among 
treatment-experienced patients in the FUSION study, the response rate was 82% with 12 
weeks of therapy and 89% with 16 weeks. Thus, SOF+RBV for 12 weeks is an optimised or 
near-optimised regimen.  
Responses in the small subgroup of patients that are treatment-experienced and cirrhotic may 
be somewhat lower; in this context, the likely possibility of successful retreatment with a longer 
duration in case of failure is noted. 
Efficacy against genotype 3 
Results from the pivotal studies conducted in genotype 2 and 3 indicate a clear difference in 
responses between the two genotypes with 12 weeks of treatment, with treatment failure in 
genotype 3, as generally the case with SOF-based therapy, almost exclusively being relapses. 
The company has conducted a phylogenetic analysis that does not show any clustering of 
relatedness of virus from patients failing therapy. This, together with similar in vitro activity 
and early on-treatment response to SOF for genotypes 2 and -3, indicates that host factors 
such as innate immunity to the different HCV genotypes, may account for the outcome 
difference. 
During the scope of the application procedure, emerging data from the VALENCE study has 
demonstrated that increasing treatment duration to 24 weeks for patients with genotype 3 can 
substantially increase response rates, approaching those seen in the treatment of genotype 2 
with 12 weeks. An alternative in selected patients that tolerate interferon, would be to add PEG 
to the regimen and treat for 12 weeks in accordance with the regimen used in the NEUTRINO 
study. Such an extrapolation, based on the higher efficacy of PEG+RBV against genotype 3 
compared to genotype 1, and the similar efficacy of SOF against both genotypes, is supported 
by data from several small studies. 
Efficacy against genotypes 4, 5 and 6 
These genotypes are relatively rare in Europe and the US, although the proportion of genotype 
4 infection in some European centres is reported to be around 10%. These genotypes have 
traditionally been treated according to the genotype 1 paradigm for PEG+RBV – that is, for 48 
weeks – although it is recognised that these genotypes may in fact be somewhat easier to cure 
with PEG+RBV than is genotype 1. Historically, small numbers of patients with such genotypes 
have been included in some predominantly genotype 1 trials of PEG+RBV. The same was done 
within the SOF+PEG+RBV genotype 1 development program (ATOMIC and NEUTRINO studies). 
However, the database for all these genotypes is small, and particularly so for genotypes -5 
and -6. CHMP guidelines on drug development in hepatitis C recognise that sparse clinical data 
may be available for such genotypes, and recommend a totality of evidence approach in order 
to demonstrate efficacy in such genotypes, including indications of similar in vitro susceptibility

Page 76/100 
 
  
  
and on treatment viral responses as in genotypes that are more extensively studied. As for 
safety, this is not expected to differ depending on viral genotype.  
In vitro susceptibility to SOF is not different for genotypes 4-6 compared to 1-3, with EC50 
values that are lower than in genotype 1b. No resistance pathways specific to these genotypes 
have been demonstrated on in vitro selection. No baseline viral polymorphisms that are 
conserved in these genotypes have hitherto been shown or suspected to impact SOF activity. 
High on-treatment potency is seen for all genotypes. Outcomes in the few patients treated are 
similar to those seen in genotype 1. Efficacy conclusions are thus considered robust across the 
spectrum of genotypes. 
Impact of dose reductions PEG and RBV on efficacy 
There was no apparent impact on efficacy in the patients that reduced the doses of co-treating 
agents PEG or RBV due to adverse effects. 
Treatment in the pre-transplant setting 
In the absence of an on-treatment virological response (unmeasurable plasma HCV-RNA at the 
time of transplantation) or an SVR, graft reinfection with HCV is near-universal. Post-transplant 
recurrence is often aggressive, and for this reason the prognosis after liver transplantation due 
to HCV is worse than the prognosis when this is due to other causes. Furthermore, the 
effectiveness of PEG-based therapy is low, with a risk of severe complications such as serious 
bacterial infections and hepatic decompensation. Interferons are contraindicated in 
decompensated liver disease. This highlights the importance of the P7977-2025 study. In an 
interim analysis, it has been shown that, in accordance with previous results for interferon 
therapy, an on-treatment response to SOF+RBV therapy is capable of preventing graft 
reinfection. Interim safety data in this study are reassuring.  
Given the very considerable benefits of preventing graft reinfection, and the emerging safety 
profile of SOF, the benefit-risk balance is positive for this indication. Also, although in the 
P7977-2025 study SOF was given for 24 weeks, the company proposes that SOF therapy be 
continued until transplantation in patients on the waiting list. This is based on a high observed 
relapse rate when discontinuing at week 24, in case there has been no transplantation. It is 
recognised that the safety database of SOF covers 24 weeks of therapy. However, given the 
anticipated benefits of on-treatment viral response, and the uncertainty of when a graft from 
an unrelated donor will be available, this is considered reasonable. An ongoing study in patients 
with very advanced liver disease where treatment is given for 48 weeks is anticipated to further 
elucidate the safety and efficacy of SOF in the relevant population, and with treatment 
durations beyond six months. 
Efficacy on retreatment after non-curative exposure 
While conclusive retreatment studies of patients experiencing virological failure on SOF-based 
therapy have not been performed, several available pieces of evidence are indicative that SOF 
likely retains its efficacy and contribution to a retreatment regimen, also after non-curative 
exposure: 
First, selection of phenotypic resistance in case of virological failure has not been 
demonstrated. Of note, the signature mutation S282T has now twice been reported to emerge; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 77/100 
 
  
  
once in the ELECTRON study, as discussed in this application, and recently at the AASLD 
meeting, on relapse after 8 weeks of therapy with SOF+ investigational NS5A inhibitor 
ledipasvir. In neither case was the emergence of this mutation associated with viral 
breakthrough, which is indicative that it does not convey full resistance to SOF (the EC50 fold-
change is roughly 10). Also, both of these patients have been reported to have been 
successfully retreated with intensified SOF-based regimens. In one of these cases, S282T was 
still detectable at baseline when retreatment commenced. 
Second, virological suppression was prompt and similar to the first round of therapy when 
patients experiencing relapse in the P7977-2025 study were retreated. 
Third, when patients that had discontinued therapy in the QUANTUM trial due to hepatotoxicity 
concerns for GS-0938, were retreated with SOF+RBV, SVR rates were similar in patients with 
up to 8 weeks of prior exposure to SOF and in those that had not been exposed to SOF in the 
study. Furthermore, there was no relation between prior time on SOF and the probability of 
SVR.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Due to its pangenotypic antiviral activity and its very high barrier to resistance SOF represents 
an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of HCV-infection. 
Available data are considered to support the efficacy of sofosbuvir across all relevant patient 
strata, and therefore the proposed indication for the treatment of HCV in adults in combination 
with other medicinal products. Further, the potential to use SOF therapy to prevent graft 
infection (and/or obtain SVR) in patients on the liver transplant list, marks an important 
therapeutic improvement. Finally, available data are indicative that SOF may retain its efficacy 
on retreatment after non-curative exposure. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The Primary Safety Population included safety data from 4 Gilead Sciences-sponsored pivotal 
Phase 3 studies. The Secondary Safety Population included individual (not pooled) data from 5 
Phase 2 studies and 1 Phase 1/2a NIAID-sponsored study. The Special HCV Population 
included individual (not pooled) data from 2 Gilead Sciences-sponsored studies in Special HCV 
populations: Study P7977-2025 (hepatic impairment) and Study GS-US-334-0123 (HIV/HCV-
coinfection).

The size of the safety database is sufficient for an evaluation, and in accordance with ICH 
guidance. Of particular note, there are 421 patients treated in 24-week SOF arms (not 
including those participating in the cross-company collaborations). Data are thus considered 
sufficient to evaluate the safety of sofosbuvir for at least 24 weeks.

Note: Subjects were counted once for each system organ class, and once for each AE preferred term . 
Note: Data included to last dose date of study regimen (or active treatment in GS-US-334-0108) plus 30

Of note anaemia, dyspnoea, pharyngitis, rash, nausea, insomnia, and anorexia constitute the 
known side effects profile of RBV, whereas fatigue, decreased appetite, myalgia, pyrexia, 
influenza-like illness, depression and neutropenia are characteristic of PEG, and are more 
common in PEG-containing regimens, with or without SOF. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One death occurred among the 566 subjects in the SOF+RBV 12-week groups. Subject 1276-
310535 in Study P7977-1231 (FISSION) died due to cocaine and heroin intoxication (preferred 
term of “toxicity to various agents”) on Study Day 1.  
No deaths occurred in the secondary Safety Population. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) across studies were infrequent (≤4% subjects in any group of 
the primary safety population). SAEs in the primary safety population were distributed as 
follows: 
SOF+RBV 
The incidence of SAEs was comparable between the SOF+RBV 12-week (3.9%, 22 subjects) 
and SOF+RBV 16-week groups (3.1%, 3 subjects).  
Malignant hepatic neoplasm (0.5%, 3 subjects), pyrexia, and cellulitis (each 0.4%, 2 subjects) 
were the only SAEs reported in ≥2 subjects in the SOF+RBV 12-week group. The reporting of 
hepatic neoplasm was not unexpected given that HCC is a complication of cirrhosis. Of the 3 
subjects with SAEs of malignant hepatic neoplasm, 2 subjects had cirrhosis at screening; the 
third subject was noted to have a cirrhotic liver configuration during evaluations for the SAE. 
No other individual SAE in the SOF+RBV 12-week groups was reported in more than 1 subject 
and there was no apparent clustering of SAEs observed within specific system organ classes 
that had ≥5 subjects reporting SAEs. There was no apparent trend in the types of events 
reported or onset time observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 84/100 
 
 
  
  
For the SOF+RBV 16 Week group, no individual SAE was reported by more than 1 subject. 
Two subjects (0.4%) in the SOF+RBV 12-week group experienced 3 treatment-related SAEs: 1 
subject with anaemia on Day 20, and 1 subject with peripheral oedema and eczema on post-
treatment Day 28. 
Few subjects experienced SAEs in the placebo (2.8%, 2 subjects) and PEG+RBV (1.2%, 
3 subjects) groups. No subjects in these groups experienced a treatment-related SAE. 
SOF+PEG+RBV 
Eight SAEs were reported in 4 subjects (1.2%) in the SOF+PEG+RBV group. No trends in SAE 
type or onset time were observed, and no individual SAE was reported in more than 1 subject 
in the SOF+PEG+RBV group.  
Four SAEs in 2 subjects (0.6%) were assessed as related to any of the 3 study drugs: anaemia 
and cryoglobulinaemia in 1 subject, and leukopenia and pyrexia in the other subject.

Note: Subject safety managed using Gilead Grading Scale for Severity of Adverse Events and Laboratory

Note: Toxicity grade must increase at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline value (missing is considered 
grade 0) to be included. 
Note: Subjects counted once at maximum toxicity grade (hyper [+] and hypo [-] when applicable) for each 
laboratory test. 
Note: Data included to last dose date of study regimen (or active treatment in GS-US-334-0108) plus 30 
days. 
When reviewing these data, it should be noted that the dose of RBV was 800 mg when used in 
combination with PEG in the control arm of the FISSION (P7977-1231) trial, but was 
1,000/1,200 mg depending on body weight when used with SOF+PEG in the NEUTRINO (GS-
US-334-0110) trial, as well as in all the SOF+RBV interferon-free arms. Taking the known 
difference in haematological side effect of these two RBV doses (which are in accordance with 
the Copegus [RBV] product information for the respective genotypes) and the known effects of 
co-administering PEG and RBV, these data are not indicative of an effect of SOF per se on 
haematological parameters.  Extending therapy with SOF+RBV to 24 weeks did not 
substantially impact the haematological safety profile.

SOF per se was not associated with grade 3/4 elevations of any of these blood chemistry 
parameters. The increase in bilirubin is secondary to RBV-related haemolysis. 
Safety in special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with compensated cirrhosis treated with SOF+PEG+RBV a higher frequency of 
anaemia and neutropenia was seen, compared to patients with less advanced liver disease. This 
is in line with previous findings with interferon-RBV combination therapy. In study P7977-2025, 
the side effect profile of RBV was apparent, as in other studies, but overall the SOF+RBV 
regimen appeared well tolerated, with reported adverse events within the spectrum of the 
expected given the underlying disease condition. No SOF-specific toxicity issues have emerged 
in this population with very advanced liver disease. An ongoing study in patients with portal 
hypertension, with and without decompensated liver disease, who are treated with SOF+RBV 
for 48 weeks, is expected to further clarify the safety profile of this regimen in this population. 
A PK/PD study in patients with hepatic impairment was not indicative of a need for dose 
adjustment. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with advanced renal impairment or ESRD, there is a substantial accumulation of 
GS-331007, with considerably less impact on sofosbuvir. There are no clinical outcome data in 
this population. The company is planning a dedicated, dose comparative study in this 
population. 
HCV/HIV coinfection 
Regarding HCV/HIV-coinfection, no specific side effects profile emerged in coinfected patients.  
Assessment report

Page 89/100 
 
 
 
  
  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation rates due to adverse events with SOF-based therapy were very low.  
Across studies of genotype 2 and 3, discontinuation rates of SOF+RBV therapy were 0-4.3% in 
different arms, which was similar to the placebo arm of the POSITRON study (4.2%). 
The very low discontinuation rate due to side effects in the NEUTRINO study (1.5%) is 
somewhat surprising, given the background regimen of PEG+RBV. Previous experiences of 
PEG+RBV-based therapies have shown discontinuation rates in a range between 5% up to and 
>10%. In comparison, in the PEG+RBV arm of FISSION 10.7% of subjects experienced an 
adverse event leading to permanent discontinuation of treatment regimen. The low 
discontinuation rate in NEUTRINO may be due to the psychological benefit of the anticipation of 
a short (12 weeks rather than up to 48 weeks) and effective regimen. However, the possibility 
that this is due to the selection of patients cannot be excluded in this uncontrolled trial.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total safety database for this marketing authorisation application contains over 1,700 
patients that have been exposed in Phase 2 and 3 trials to regimens including SOF as 
monotherapy, in combination with RBV or in combination with PEG+RBV, for 12-24 weeks. 
Importantly, this includes over 600 patients in 24-week treatment arms (see table 16, and 
additional data from PHOTON-1 and VALENCE studies). The Phase 3 program included 
approximately 260 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Inclusion criteria regarding baseline 
platelet counts in the interferon-free Phase 3 studies were >20-50,000/µl. Furthermore, 
interim data from the P7977-2025 included 61 patients on the transplant list due to HCC; 17 
of these where Child-Pugh B at baseline. 
The proportion of patients experiencing SAEs in the SOF arms of the Phase 3 trials were 1.2-
3.9%. Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were experienced by 0-2.4% in 
different SOF-containing treatment arms. One treatment-emergent death occurred in the 
primary safety population; this was an overdose of heroin and cocaine on Day 1 of the 
relevant study. 
The most common side effects reported include fatigue, headache, nausea and insomnia. In 
the SOF+RBV-containing arms, irritability, anaemia, cough and dyspnoea were more common 
that with placebo. Of note, these side effects have been associated with RBV therapy, the 
hallmark side effect of which is haemolytic anaemia. The side effect profile when SOF was 
coadministered with PEG+RBV was typical of PEG-based therapy. Discontinuations due to 
adverse events were lower than is usually seen with such treatment modalities. Of particular 
interest, in relation to the toxicology findings no clinical cardiac toxicity signal has been 
identified. 
Patients with compensated cirrhosis are somewhat more prone to hyperbilirubinaemia 
secondary to RBV-associated haemolysis, and to haematological abnormalities when treated 
with PEG, compared to patients without cirrhosis. There is no indication that SOF adds to the 
severity of the side effect profile in such patients. Furthermore, no specific safety signal has 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/688774/2013 
Page 90/100 
 
 
  
  
been identified in the pre-transplant population. A hepatic impairment study is not indicative 
of a need for dose adjustment. The appropriate dose in severe renal impairment, however, 
has not yet been defined. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary, SOF is well-tolerated when used in combination with RBV, with or without PEG. 
Experience of SOF monotherapy is very limited, and no SOF-specific adverse effect profile has 
been identified.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
For the treatment of genotype 1 infection in treatment-naïve patients with compensated liver 
disease, SOF+PEG+RBV given for 12 weeks of therapy, yielded a 90.5% SVR rate in a single- 
armed study (NEUTRINO). The 95% CI for this proportion was 86.6-93.5%.  
In a randomised controlled trial in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 2/3 infection and 
compensated liver disease, SOF+RBV treatment for 12 weeks was compared with the present 
standard-of-care, PEG+RBV for 24 weeks (FISSION). The SOF+RBV regimen gave an SVR rate 
of 66.8%, versus 66.7% for the reference regimen. The difference in proportions was 0.3% 
with a 95% CI of -7.5 to 8.0%. Non-inferiority was met in accordance with a pre-set margin, 
agreed with European regulators, of -15%.  
In a further study, SOF+RBV for 12 weeks was compared with placebo, in patients with 
genotype 2/3 infection that were ineligible, intolerant or unwilling to take interferon-based 
therapy (POSITRON). In this study, the SVR rate for SOF+RBV was 77.8%. As expected, the 
SVR rate for placebo was 0%. The difference in response was 77.3% with a 95% CI of 71-
83.6%.  
Also, SOF+RBV for 12 weeks was compared with SOF+RBV for 16 weeks in patients with 
genotype 2/3 infection and compensated liver disease who had previously failed treatment 
with PEG+RBV (FUSION). In this study, the overall SVR rate was 49.5% with 12 weeks of 
therapy, and 71.4% with 16 weeks of therapy. The difference in proportions between the two 
arms was 23.4% with a 95% CI of 11.4-35.4%. 
SVR rates in genotype 2 and genotype 3, studied under the same protocols and with the same 
regimens, differed markedly. Response rates in FISSION, POSITRON, FUSION 12 week arm 
and FUSION 16 week arm, for SOF+RBV were as follows: For genotype 2: 94.5%, 92,7%, 
82.1% and 88.6%, respectively; for genotype 3: 55.7%, 61.2%, 29.7% and 61.9%, 
respectively. In the VALENCE study, where treatment of genotype 3 was extended to 24 
weeks, this led to a response rate of 84% (95% CI 78.9-88.3%). Results from the PHOTON-1 
study in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients indicate comparable response rates compared to 
monoinfected patients. 
In the PHOTON-1 study of HIV/HCV co-infected patients, the combination of SOF+RBV for 24 
weeks in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 achieved an SVR rate of 76.3% (95% CI 
67.4-83.8%). This regimen is supported by three other studies showing point estimates in the 
range of 50-70%, and its efficacy appears higher in genotype 1a compared to genotype 1b. 
The combination of SOF+RBV for 24 weeks was also studied in a single-armed study in a 
population of patients with hepatitis C and HCC, who were on the waiting list for liver 
transplantation (study P7977-2025). In an interim analysis submitted as part of the dossier, 
61 patients were treated, a third of whom had Child-Pugh B at baseline. 23/37 patients that 
had plasma HCV-RNA <LLOQ at the time of transplantation and were followed for 12 weeks 
post-transplant, did not show evidence of graft infection. The proportion is 62.2%, and the

90% CI is 47.3-75.5%. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
For genotype 1, the Phase 3 study was conducted with SOF+PEG+RBV for 12 weeks in 
treatment-naïve patients. It is unclear whether this duration is optimal for cirrhotics who, 
despite a comparably high response rate of 79.6%, might have an increased probability of 
SVR with a longer duration. Also, while it is recognised that the category of patients termed 
“treatment-experienced” to PEG+RBV are functionally contained in a treatment-naïve 
population (as half of these patients would not reach SVR with PEG+RBV, and there is no 
selection of resistance with this regimen), the representation of patients with the lowest 
intrinsic interferon response (null responders) was likely low in the study; such patients might 
also benefit from a longer treatment duration. 
A regimen of SOF+RBV for 24 weeks in genotype 1 has shown SVR rates of approximately 
75% in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. Other studies show that the efficacy of this regimen 
appears similar in monoinfected patients, indicating that HIV-coinfection likely does not 
greatly impact responses to SOF-based therapy. However, the efficacy of this regimen in 
cirrhotics with genotype 1 is unclear as few patients have been treated. Furthermore, SVR 
rates were lower in genotype 1b than 1a (54.2 versus 82.2%). Such differences of varying 
magnitude have been seen in several studies; the reason for this has not been fully 
elucidated. 
The precise magnitude of effect of SOF in the treatment of patients in the pre-transplant 
setting is not known. The sample size in the interim analysis from the P7977-2025 study 
underlying this indication is small. Also, while 24 weeks of therapy in case no transplantation 
occurs yields a high relapse rate, it is unclear what rates may be reached with 48 weeks of 
therapy, which is presently being investigated. Also, it may be that the benefit-risk balance in 
this situation can be optimised by co-treatment with SOF and another DAA. 
Available, limited, evidence is indicative that SOF may retain its efficacy on retreatment after 
non-curative exposure; however, SVR data in patients with virological failure at the planned 
end of treatment are still scarce. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
SOF has mainly been studied in combination therapy, particularly with RBV +/- PEG. Apart 
from RBV-related anaemia, side effects with SOF+RBV bitherapy that are more common than 
with placebo include fatigue, insomnia, arthralgia and myalgia. No clearly SOF-specific side 
effects have been identified, and tolerability does not evidently differ from placebo.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety database in patients with decompensated liver disease is presently very small. 
There are uncertainties about what magnitude of increased exposure to SOF and its 
metabolites is safe, which has relevance for dosing in severe renal impairment.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
SVR is associated with an end to progression of liver disease. The possibility of reaching SVR 
without interferon marks a considerable therapeutic advance, partly due to the general side 
effects profile of interferon, but also, importantly, since this side effects profile makes a 
considerable proportion of HCV patients ineligible for interferon-based therapy. This includes 
not only patients with very advanced liver disease (e.g. with very low platelet levels or 
albumin <35 g/L), in whom interferon-based therapies are associated with a considerable risk 
of serious bacterial infections and hepatic decompensation, and patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis in whom PEGs are contraindicated, but also patients with psychiatric diseases, 
autoimmune disorders etc. 
Furthermore, again given the side effects profile of interferons, the possibility of reaching very 
high SVR rates (90% in NEUTRINO) with only 12 weeks of interferon-based therapy marks an 
important advance compared to 24-48 weeks with current standard-of-care.   
In the absence of treatment, graft infection after liver transplantation is near universal and 
post-transplant recurrence is often aggressive. For this reason, patients that are transplanted 
due to HCV have a worse prognosis compared to patients transplanted due to other reasons. 
Consequently, a further, very considerable, benefit of SOF is the possibility of preventing graft 
infection after liver transplantation by reaching an on treatment virological response or SVR 
with SOF+RBV. While this has previously been demonstrated with interferon-based therapy, 
most of the relevant patients are not eligible for such treatment, for reasons given above, and 
in those that tolerate interferon-based therapy, these have low efficacy. 
Unlike several other DAAs, SOF has pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance. On 
treatment viral breakthrough is very uncommon with SOF combination therapy. Furthermore, 
no selection of clinically relevant resistance to SOF has hitherto been shown. This quality of 
SOF makes it a potential backbone for a number of different combination regimens. Available 
data, though scarce, are indicative that retreatment with SOF-based therapy (in combination 
with more drugs, or for a longer duration), may be effective in patients that fail a first course.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Taking the above-mentioned uncertainties into account, including the fact that the optimal use 
of SOF in some situations remains unclear, and that experience in decompensated liver 
disease is scarce, the demonstrated considerable benefits for the sought indication, for use “in 
combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults”, 
outweigh the demonstrated risks. 
Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of sofosbuvir is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Sovaldi in combination with other medicinal 
products for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in adults is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal products on “restricted” medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation 
holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the 
requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 
107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in 
the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed 
subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile 
or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted 
at the same time. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that sofosbuvir is qualified as a new active substance.

Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted an overview and the Japanese final reports for: 
•  CSTI571AJP03 (last patient last visit on December 31, 2009), Implementation Outline of 
Special Investigation (Long-Term Use) of Glivec® 100 mg Capsules in two patients with 
chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 
•  CSTI571I1401 (last patient last visit on February 28, 2010), Special Drug Use 
Observational Investigation (long-term use) Glivec® l00mg tablets in six patients with 
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ALL) 
Novartis is submitting the results of these clinical trials to the CHMP in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 which requires that any marketing authorization holder 
sponsored study which involves the use in the paediatric population of a medicinal product covered 
by a marketing authorization, whether or not they are conducted in compliance with an agreed 
paediatric investigation plan, is to be submitted to the competent authority.  
Imatinib is approved in the following indications in paediatric population in Europe at a 
recommended dose of 340 mg/m2 daily: 
• 
• 
• 
Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML for whom bone marrow transplantation 
is not considered as the first line of treatment 
Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, 
or in blast crisis or accelerated phase 
Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL integrated with chemotherapy

As in adults, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and showed a 1.7-fold 
accumulation at steady state in paediatric patients. Plasma concentrations at steady state in 
children following once daily dosing with 260 mg/m2 and 340 mg/m2 were comparable to the 
exposure in adults at daily doses of 400 mg and 600 mg, respectively. 
Comparison of the relationship between dose based either on body surface area (BSA) (m2) or 
body weight (kg) and area under the curve (AUC) at steady state showed that dosing based on 
body weight (kg) did not reduce interpatient variability of AUC compared to dosing based on BSA 
(m2). Therefore, the conventional approach of dosing based on BSA is appropriate in paediatric 
patients (Champagne 2004). 
The analysis confirmed that exposure of imatinib in paediatric patients receiving 260 mg/m2/d (not 
exceeding 400 mg/d) or 340 mg/m2/d (not exceeding 600 mg/d) were similar to those in adult 
patients who received imatinib 400 mg/d or 600 mg/d.

Clinical studies 
Study CSTI571AJP03 was carried out in Japan only. This study was an observational study to 
confirm the safety and efficacy of Glivec capsules in Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients 
during long-term use, 5 years, and report on the actual use of the drug in medical practice. This 
study included 326 adult and paediatric patients in total. The safety analysis included 324 patients, 
304 were included in the analysis of haematological effects, and 291 were included in the analysis 
of cytogenetic effects. Two paediatric patients participated in this study. For patients in the chronic 
phase (CP) of CML (CML-CP), the imatinib dose was 400 mg once daily, with a maximum dose of 
600 mg once daily in the adult population. For the accelerated or blastic phase of CML, the imatinib 
dose was 600 mg once daily, with the maximum daily dose of 800 mg (400 mg twice daily) in the 
adult population. The paediatric dose of imatinib was defined based on the standard of care for Ph+ 
CML paediatric patients in Japan. The dose was adjusted depending on the patient’s haematological 
findings, age and symptoms. 
Efficacy evaluation was performed in 304 patients for the analysis of haematological endpoints and 
291 patients for the analysis of cytogenetical endpoints. 
The haematological efficacy rate was 94.4% (287/304 patients), and the cytogenetic efficacy rate 
was 87.6% (255/291 patients). The efficacy rates in study CSTI571AJP03 were comparable to the 
response rate in clinical trials supporting the approval of Glivec which had demonstrated a rate of 
complete haematological remission (93.8%) and a rate of cytogenetical effects (40.6%) in a 
Japanese clinical study (phase II part of Study 1201) involving patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML-CP and a rate of complete haematological remission (88.0%) and 
a rate of cytogenetical effects (33.3%) in a clinical study (Study 0110) not conducted in Japan in 
patients with CML-CP. 
Efficacy evaluation for paediatric patients was not performed separately in this study 
In study CSTI571AJP03 a total of 2143 AEs were reported in 294 patients (adults and paediatric 
patient population). The incidence of any AEs in any patient was 91% (294/324 patients). 
Two (2) paediatric patients with Ph+ CML participated in the study. 
No deaths were reported during this study among paediatric patients. None of the paediatric 
patient experienced AE leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Both paediatric patients experienced AEs. The only SOC for the AEs was blood and lymphatic 
system disorders.

The most frequently reported AEs were anaemia and neutropenia. 
One (1) paediatric patient completed study treatment and 1 paediatric patient discontinued due to 
logistic reasons. 
Study CSTI571I1401 was carried out in Japan. This study was an observational study to determine 
the safety and efficacy of Glivec 100 mg tablets in long-term use for Ph + acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) and was used as part of the re-examination of the application dossier for data 
generated in actual medical practice. This study included 162 adult and paediatric patients in total. 
The safety analysis included 161 patients, 136 were included in the analysis of anti-leukaemia 
effects, and 130 were included in the analysis of cytogenetic effects. Six paediatric patients 
participated in the study. The dose of imatinib was 600 mg once daily. The dose of imatinib could 
be decreased based on hematologic findings, age and symptoms of the patient. The paediatric dose 
of imatinib was defined based on the standard of care for Ph+ ALL paediatric patients in Japan. 
Efficacy evaluation was performed in 136 patients included in the analysis of anti-leukaemia 
endpoints and 130 patients included in the analysis of cytogenetical endpoints. 
For efficacy evaluation based on anti-leukaemia endpoints, patients achieving complete 
haematological remission (CHR) and complete marrow remission/partial haematological remission 
were regarded as responders. For efficacy evaluation based on cytogenetical endpoints, patients 
achieving complete cytogenetical remission (CCyR) and major cytogenetical remission (MCyR) were 
regarded as responders. 
The anti-leukaemia efficacy rate was 96.32% (131/136 patients) and the cytogenetic efficacy rated 
was 96.92% (126/130 patients). The efficacy rates were not markedly different from the efficacy 
rate that had been determined in the Japanese clinical studies conducted for the approval of Glivec, 
both for anti-leukaemia efficacy rate (100.00% [8/8 patients]) and cytogenetical efficacy rate 
(87.5% [7/8 patients]). 
Efficacy evaluation for paediatric patients was not performed separately. 
In CSTI571I1401 study a total of 381 AEs were reported in 108 patients (adults and paediatric 
patient population). The incidence of any AE in a patient was 67.1% (108/161 patients). 
A total of 6 paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL participated in the study. No deaths were reported 
during this study among paediatric patients. 
The incidence of any AEs occurring in paediatric patients was 66.6% (4/6 patients). The SOCs with 
the highest incidence were: 
 Ga s t r o in t e s t in a l d is o rd e r s  w it h  4 / 6  p a t ie n t s  ( 6 6 . 6 % )  
 Ge n e r a l d is o r d e r s  a n d  a d m in is t r a t io n  s it e  c o n d it ions with 3/6 patients (50%). 
The PTs with the highest incidence were face oedema and nausea (33.3% of the patients each). 
Two (2) paediatric patients (33.3%) discontinued study treatment because of haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT); 2 paediatric patients (33.3%) completed study treatment,1 paediatric 
patient (16.6%) discontinued due to disease progression, and 1 paediatric patient (16.6%) 
experienced AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. 
The safety profile was consistent with that reported in other imatinib studies conducted in 
paediatric population with Ph+ ALL; there were no new safety signals.

Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Two clinical studies have been submitted within the framework of article 46. These two studies 
were carried out in Japan, being the purpose of these trials to provide post-marketing surveillance 
data in Japanese patients.  
The first one, study CSTI571AJP03 investigated the use of glivec in CML patients, whereas the 
second one, study CSTI571I1401 was designed in order to provide data in Ph+ALL patients.  
Few data can be obtained from these two clinical trials, since only 2 and 6 paediatric patients were 
recruited in these studies. Given the low number of subjects the MAH has submitted only a clinical 
overview for both studies (with the CSR in Japanese). This strategy even though debatable a priori, 
has eventually no impact on the final conclusions that can be drawn from these studies, seeing as 
on the one hand there were very few paediatric subjects and on the other hand, data from children 
were not performed separately. 
Overall, efficacy and safety data in these two clinical trials are in line with those previously 
reported. 
The conclusions from these two Japanese studies do not modify the benefit-risk conclusion of 
glivec, both in CML and Ph+ALL.

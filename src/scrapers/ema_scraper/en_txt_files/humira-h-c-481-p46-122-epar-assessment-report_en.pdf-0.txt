1.  Introduction 
On 05 March 2021, the MAH submitted a final study report of a completed paediatric study (P17-164) 
for Humira (adalimumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Humira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to 
one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy 
in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is 
inappropriate. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH submitted a final study report for: 
Study P17-164 (P46 Study): Prospective Multi-Center Observational Study to Assess Persistence, 
Adherence and Changes in Disease Activity in the Children Population of Juvenile Arthritis Patients 
Treated with adalimumab (HUMIRA) in the Routine Clinical Settings in the Russian Federation (PETITE) 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Humira is approved for two paediatric indications in Russia according to the MAH (polyarticular JIA in 
patients > 2 years, and enthesitis-related arthritis in patients > 6 years); and was administered 
according to the Russian product label, which was not provided. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Clinical study 
P17-164: Prospective Multi-Center Observational Study to Assess Persistence, Adherence and 
Changes in Disease Activity in the Children Population of Juvenile Arthritis Patients Treated with 
adalimumab (HUMIRA) in the Routine Clinical Settings in the Russian Federation (PETITE) 
Description 
The Study P17-164 was a prospective, non-interventional, product-focused, longitudinal, and multi-
center study with no control group designed to assess persistence, adherence, and change in disease 
activities in children diagnosed with polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) according to 
International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria treated with adalimumab 
(Humira) over 48 weeks in routine clinical settings in the Russian Federation.

Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was: 
●  To assess persistence in patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
1. 
2. 
To assess adherence in patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks. 
To assess change of disease activity using the 10-joint juvenile arthritis disease activity score 
(JADAS10) and American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30, 50, and 70 response criteria 
(ACR Pedi 30/50/70) and its components* including extra-articular manifestations (EAMs), 
such as JIA-associated non-infectious uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, in 
patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks. 
* 
Information about disease activity based on JADAS10, ACR Pedi 30/50/70, and Childhood 
Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) was collected from the 
medical charts if the site and physicians/investigators applied them in the routine medical 
practice.  If physicians/investigators did not apply JADAS10, ACR Pedi 30/50/70, and CHAQ 
in the routine medical practice, then Unknown/Not Available/Not Applicable checkbox was 
to be chosen.  In this study, AbbVie did not provide any license permission for using 
JADAS10, ACR Pedi 30/50/70, and CHAQ to investigators nor special training for correct 
usage of JADAS10, ACR Pedi 30/50/70, and CHAQ.  Only routine medical practice data were 
collected and further analyzed in this post-marketing observational study. 
Study population /Sample size 
70 patients were included in this descriptive observational study without any priory sample size 
justification/calculation. Convenient sampling methods were used for enrollment of patients who 
attended routine outpatient visits, fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria and had signed patient’s 
informed consent form by the parent or guardian/and by the child (if applicable). 
Patient was included in the study if he/she met the following criteria: 
1. Aged ≥ 2 and < 18 years. 
2. Confirmed diagnosis of polyarticular JIA according to ILAR criteria (International League of 
Associations for Rheumatology).  
3. Planned treatment with HUMIRA according to the local product label and prescription guidelines. 
Alternatively, subjects assigned to HUMIRA treatment not more than 1 month prior to inclusion can be 
enrolled. 
4. Negative result of tuberculosis (TB) screening procedure and TB specialist permission to start 
biologic therapy. 
5. Patient’s informed consent form signed by the parent or guardian/and by the child, if applicable.  
Patients meeting any of the following criteria were not included in the study:

1. Has contraindications for the treatment with HUMIRA according to the latest version of the locally 
approved label. 
2. Any biologic drugs taken prior to 3 months of enrolment in the study. 
3. Patients treated with any biosimilar version of HUMIRA. 
4. Previous participation and dropout from this study. 
5. Patients participating in another clinical and/or observational study priory 3 months before the 
enrolment to this study. 
Treatments 
Treatment with Humira was according to the local product label and prescription guidelines. Humira 
was prescribed by physician according to the routine clinical practice. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Variables 
• Humira persistence  
(1) Persistence was defined as the time (in days) between the start date of Humira (adalimumab) 
treatment and the earliest date of discontinuation* of Humira (adalimumab) or drop out of study or 
lost to follow up. Patients who did not discontinue after 48 weeks follow up period were censored at 48 
weeks. 
(2) Persistent rate – defined as the probability of patients that are ongoing on treatment at 48 weeks 
since they started on Humira (adalimumab) using Kaplan-Meier Method. 
* Humira (adalimumab) discontinuation was defined as the interruption of continual adalimumab 
therapy for at least 28 days between doses (without prescription of an alternate bDMARD). Periods of 
less than 28 days between doses were defined as temporary dose delays, not meeting the criteria for a 
Humira (adalimumab) discontinuation. Also, discontinuation included stopping to participate in the 
study due to any reason (death, lost to follow-up, discontinuation due to AEs, switching to another 
treatment, physician decision, others). 
Secondary Variables 
• Medication adherence over observational study period – the extent to which a patient act in 
accordance with the prescribed interval and dose of a dosing. The cut-off for the adherence/non-
adherence set up for this study at ≥ 80% of timely taking doses. 
The measure is based on patient or caregiver/legal representative reported data (patient or 
caregiver/legal representative diaries). 
• Proportion of patients with 30%, 50% and 70% ACR pedi responses at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational 
visits. The ACR Pediatric 30, 50, 70 are defined as 30%, 50%, and 70%, improvement respectively in 
a minimum of three core set criteria with worsening of one variable by no more than 30%. 
• Change from baseline in physician overall disease activity measured by of 10 cm VAS – at 2, 3, 4 and 
5 observational visits. 
• Change from baseline in patient (if appropriate in age) or parent overall well-being measured by 10 
cm VAS at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits.

• Change from baseline in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) 
total score and subscales (disability, discomfort and pain) score at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
• Change from baseline in number of joints with active arthritis at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
• Change from baseline in number of joints with limited range of motion at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational 
visits 
• Change from baseline in ESR at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
• Change from baseline in JADAS10 at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
• Proportion of patient with low diseases activity (defined as a JADAS10 of 1.1 – 2) and moderate 
disease activity (defined as a JADAS10 of 2.1 – 4.2) based on JADAS10 at baseline, 2, 3, 4 and 5 
observational visits. 
• Proportion of patients with one, two and etc. missed dosed of HUMIRA and number of missed doses 
at 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
• Proportion of patients with any Extra-articular manifestations (EAMs) (JIA-associated non inflectional 
uveitis, IBD, psoriasis) at baseline, 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
• Proportion of patients with any comorbidity at baseline, 2, 3, 4 and 5 observational visits. 
Statistical Methods 
Categorical (qualitative) variables were summarized with the number and proportion of patients in 
each category. Exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for a single proportion for each 
category was calculated. 
For interval (quantitative) variables values on baseline and each visit and change from baseline to each 
visit were presented with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics included number of patients, 
mean, standard deviation, median, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile, minimum and maximum values, and 95% 
CI for mean or median (as appropriate). 
Comparison between baseline and other visits was made using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test or the 
Friedman Test for dependent variables (as appropriate). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 70 patients with polyarticular JIA according to ILAR criteria (22 male and 48 female patients) 
from 16 clinical sites were included in the study.  
Baseline data 
Patients enrolled had a median age of 10 years (range: 2 to 17) and were predominantly female 
(48/70; 68.6%). All patients with recorded values had highly active disease at baseline as defined by a 
JADAS10 > 4.2. Mean JADAS10 total score at baseline was 22.6.  Patients also had high numbers of 
joints with active arthritis (mean 8.6) and elevated acute phase erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 
mean 26.3 mm/h).

The most common diseases in the medical history of patients by system organ class (SOC) were eye 
disorders (18 patients, 25.7%); gastrointestinal disorders (8 patients, 11.4%); and congenital, familial 
and genetic disorders (6 patients, 8.6%). The most common diagnosis by preferred term was 
iridocyclitis (14 patients, 20%). 
The most common prior medications were folic acid analogues (29 patients, 41.4%), glucocorticoids 
(20 patients, 28.6%), and immunosuppressants (16 patients, 22.9%). The most common concomitant 
drug therapy included folic acid analogs (53 patients, 75.7%) and folic acid and derivatives (14 
patients, 20%). 
Efficacy results 
Persistence in patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks 
In the enrolled patient population (70 patients), the median duration of therapy with Humira 
(adalimumab) was 338.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 336 – 350 days; range: 91 to 438 days).  
For patients with persistence who completed the 48-week study (n = 59), the median duration of 
therapy was 343 days (95% CI 337 – 351 days), and for patients with discontinuation (n = 11) – 183 
days (95% CI 92 – 280 days).  
Most patients continued therapy at the end of the study (48 weeks or 336 days). At 48 weeks of 
follow-up, 59 patients (84.3%) continued therapy with Humira. The probability of patients remains on 
treatment 48 weeks (point estimate of the persistent rate at Week 48 using the Kaplan-Meier Curve) 
after commencing Humira (adalimumab) was 0.857 (95% CI 0.779 – 0.943). See (Tables 10.3-2, 10-
3.3) below.

Adherence in patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks. 
Most patients (64/67 patients with evaluable adherence data, 95.5%) demonstrated high adherence to 
therapy (≥ 80% of timely taking doses). The mean number of missed doses in the study was 0.239 
suggesting that patients follow the recommendations for the adalimumab (Humira) therapy regimen. 
Change of disease activity in patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks 
Change of disease activity was assessed using the 10-joint juvenile arthritis disease activity score 
(JADAS10) and ACR Pedi 30/50/70 response criteria and its components including extra-articular 
manifestations (EAMs), such as JIA-associated non-infectious uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and 
psoriasis. 
By Week 12, 58/58 (100%) of patients had achieved at least ACR Pedi 30, with 43/58 (74.1%) 
achieving ACR Pedi 50, and 18/58 (31.0%) achieving ACR Pedi 70. At Week 48, the proportions of 
patients achieving ACR Pedi 30, 50, and 70 were 50/50 (100%), 47/50 (94.0%), and 46/50 (92.0%), 
respectively. 
All patients had high disease activity at baseline (JADAS10 > 4.2).  At Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, the 
proportion of patients achieving at least low disease, defined as a JADAS10 ≤ 2.0 was 2/63 (3.2%), 
9/64 (14.1%), 21/64 (32.8%), and 30/58 (51.7%), respectively.  Furthermore, the proportions of 
patients achieving a classification of inactive disease (defined as a JADAS10 ≤ 1.0) were 2/63 (3.2%), 
3/64 (4.7%), 13/64 (20.3%), and 19/58 (32.8%) at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, respectively. The 
mean JADAS10 total score decreased (improved) during the study:  mean values at baseline, Weeks 
12, 24, 36, and 48 were 22.649, 11.956, 7.556, 5.041, and 3.179, respectively.

There was a decrease in the number of joints with active arthritis and a decrease in the number of 
joints with limited range of motion over the course of the study compared to baseline.  The mean 
number of joints with active arthritis as per ACR Pedi at baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 was 
8.594, 3.525, 1.78, 1.05, and 0.528, respectively.  The mean number of joints with limited range of 
motion as per ACR Pedi at baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 was 7.594, 4.017, 2.508, 1.717, and 
0.981, respectively. 
Physician assessment of overall disease activity measured by 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) 
decreased (improved) over the course of the study with a mean change from baseline of –5.875 cm at 
Week 48.  Similarly, patient (if appropriate in age) or parent assessment of overall well-being 
measured by 10 cm VAS decreased (improved) during the study with a mean change from baseline of 
–5.946 cm at Week 48. 
Disability as measured by CHAQ-DI showed improvements over baseline through Week 48 in patients 
with recorded values including improvements for individual disability assessment parameters dressing, 
arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, activities, discomfort and pain, and general evaluation. 
Treatment with Humira did not appear to influence the presence of extra-articular manifestations 
(EAMs) of JIA. The proportions of patients with EAMs of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA-associated 
non-inflectional uveitis, IBD, psoriasis) remained almost unchanged during the study. However, it 
should be noted that this study did not assess whether these EAMs had improved during the course of 
the study. 
CHMP's comment:  
Results of the primary and secondary outcome measures were summarised by the MAH which included 
assessment of persistence in patients with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks 
(primary objective); and assessment of adherence and change of disease activity using the JADAS10 
and ACR Pedi 30/50/70 and its components including extra-articular manifestations (EAMs), in patients 
with polyarticular JIA treated with Humira over 48 weeks (secondary objectives).  
Persistence is defined as the time between the start date of Humira treatment and the earliest date of 
discontinuation of Humira, or drop out of study, or lost to follow up. Humira discontinuation was 
defined as the interruption of continual adalimumab therapy for at least 28 days between doses 
(without prescription of an alternate bDMARD). Periods of less than 28 days between doses were 
defined as temporary dose delays, not meeting the criteria for a Humira discontinuation. 
The most common reason for discontinuation was more than 28 days between doses (5 patients, 
45.5% of patients with discontinuation). According to the MAH, the remaining reasons for 
discontinuation of therapy (including switching to another therapy or the ineffectiveness of 
adalimumab) account for less than half of the cases of discontinuation of therapy. There were not 
patients who discontinued the study by physician decision according to completion form. However, it is 
not clear to the PRAC Rapporteur if the reason for Humira discontinuation was due to AE in any cases. 
Overall, the MAH concluded that the patients are highly persistent and compliant with the prescribed 
therapy; and adalimumab is an effective disease-modifying biological agent from the point of view of 
evaluating the use of adalimumab in routine pediatric practice and in clinical trials in Russia.   
The efficacy results have not been reviewed in detail since the focus/scope for this P46 is safety in 
paediatric patients with polyarticular JIA. However, it is agreed that a great majority of the included

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

patients remained on the Humira therapy throughout the study, which indicates efficacy of Humira as 
well as good tolerability in the studied population (polyarticular JIA patients).  
Safety results 
The study recorded a total of 4 AE’s, all of which were serious adverse events (SAEs), and all occurred 
in the same female patient: 2 severe SAEs (PT 10014581 Encephalitis and PT 10046980 Varicella) and 
2 moderate SAEs (PT 10003591 Ataxia (ataxic syndrome) and PT 10061281 Meningeal disorder 
(meningeal symptoms)).  
For all reported adverse events, there was no reasonable possible association with the use of 
adalimumab (Humira). The patient experienced varicella with an onset date of 31 October 2019 
followed by encephalitis, ataxia, and meningeal disorder on 06 November 2019. Humira was 
discontinued due to the events, and the 4 SAEs resolved on 21 November 2019. The investigator 
attributed the SAEs of encephalitis, ataxia, and meningeal disorder to the SAE of varicella.  For the SAE 
of varicella, the investigator reported no reasonable possible association with the use of Humira; an 
alternate etiology was not provided. 
Overall, Humira treatment of patients with polyarticular JIA throughout the study was well tolerated.  
CHMP's comment: 
A total of 4 serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded and all of them occurred in the same female 
patient; which included 2 severe SAEs (preferred terms: encephalitis and varicella) and 2 moderate 
SAEs (preferred terms: ataxia (ataxic syndrome) and meningeal disorder (meningeal symptoms)). 
According to the MAH, there was no reasonable possible association with the use of adalimumab 
(Humira) for all the reported adverse events. The investigator attributed the SAEs of encephalitis,

ataxia, and meningeal disorder to the SAE of varicella. For the SAE of varicella, the investigator 
reported no reasonable possible association with the use of Humira. 
It is known that the risk of infections is increased during Humira treatment including serious infections 
/ opportunistic infections. SAE of varicella was reported before, e.g. varicella was reported in 7 serious 
cases involving patients aged < 18 years treated with adalimumab in PSUSA 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00000057/201612. The MAH concluded that no new safety signals or unexpected 
trends were identified during this study. No updates to the product information have been proposed by 
the MAH as part of this Article 46 submission. 
The overall risk for serious infections including opportunistic infections are well covered in the SmPC 
for adalimumab. The PRAC Rapporteur considers that no new or unexpected findings were identified in 
the MAH’s presentation of data (Study P17-164). It is however noted that there is unclearness in 
methodology regarding collecting/registering AEs. No non-serious AEs were presented in the study 
report. Absence of non-serious AEs in this study population is not very likely and it is assumed that the 
non-serious AEs were not recorded.  
Conclusions as provided by the MAH 
This prospective, multicenter, observational study demonstrated high compliance and persistence of 
therapy in routine clinical practice, which supports the conclusion that Humira is convenient to use in 
the treatment of patients with polyarticular JIA.  The results of this study regarding the effects of 
therapy on the manifestations of JIA in children are consistent with the published data. No new safety 
signals or unexpected trends were identified during this study.  The benefit-risk of adalimumab is 
unchanged and no update to the Summary of Product Characteristics has been proposed as a result of 
the data obtained during this study. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted a final study report of a completed paediatric study (P17-164) for Humira 
(adalimumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
The Study P17-164 was a prospective, non-interventional, product-focused, longitudinal, and multi-
center study with no control group. The study was conducted in order to assess persistence, 
adherence, and change in disease activities in children diagnosed with polyarticular JIA according to 
ILAR criteria treated with adalimumab (Humira) over 48 weeks in routine clinical settings in the 
Russian Federation. Treatment with Humira was according to the local product label and prescription 
guidelines, and it should be noted that these are not available to the PRAC Rapporteur. However, it is 
assumed that the posology was in accordance with the EU label. Humira was prescribed by physician 
according to the routine clinical practice. Only routine medical practice data were collected and further 
analyzed in this study. It is noted that there is unclearness in methodology regarding 
collecting/registering AEs, see further discussion below. 
A total of 70 patients with polyarticular JIA according to ILAR criteria (22 male and 48 female patients) 
from 16 clinical sites were included in the study (11 patients did not complete the study; 59 patients 
fully completed participation in accordance with the protocol). Patients enrolled had a median age of 10 
years (range: 2 to 17) and were predominantly female (48/70; 68.6%). All patients with recorded 
values had highly active disease at baseline.

Efficacy results 
The primary objective of this study was to assess persistence in patients with polyarticular JIA treated 
with Humira over 48 weeks. Persistence is defined as the time between the start date of Humira 
treatment and the earliest date of discontinuation of Humira, or drop out of study, or lost to follow up. 
Humira discontinuation was defined as the interruption of continual adalimumab therapy for at least 28 
days between doses (without prescription of an alternate bDMARD). Persistent rate is defined as the 
probability of patients that are ongoing on treatment at 48 weeks since they started on Humira using 
Kaplan-Meier method. 
In the enrolled patient population (70 patients), the median duration of therapy with Humira 
(adalimumab) was 338.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 336 – 350 days).  For patients with 
persistence who completed the 48-week study (n = 59), the median duration of therapy was 343 days 
(95% CI 337 – 351 days). Most patients continued therapy at the end of the study (48 weeks or 336 
days). At 48 weeks of follow-up, 59 patients (84.3%) continued therapy with Humira. The probability 
of patients remains on treatment 48 weeks (point estimate of the persistent rate using the Kaplan-
Meier Curve) after commencing Humira (adalimumab) was 0.857 (95% CI 0.779 – 0.943). 
The most common reason for discontinuation was more than 28 days between doses (5 patients, 
45.5% of patients with discontinuation). According to the MAH, the remaining reasons for 
discontinuation of therapy (including switching to another therapy or the ineffectiveness of 
adalimumab) account for less than half of the cases of discontinuation of therapy. However, it is not 
clear to the PRAC Rapporteur if the reason for Humira discontinuation was due to AE in any cases. 
The secondary outcome measures included assessment of adherence and 95.5% patients (64/67 
polyarticular JIA patients with evaluable adherence data) demonstrated adherence to Humira therapy 
(≥ 80% of timely taking doses). Results of change of disease activity in patients with polyarticular JIA 
treated with Humira over 48 weeks (JADAS10 and ACR Pedi 30/50/70 and its components including 
EAMs) were also summarised by the MAH.  
Overall, the MAH concluded that the patients are highly persistent and compliant with the prescribed 
therapy; and adalimumab is an effective disease-modifying biological agent from the point of view of 
evaluating the use of adalimumab in routine pediatric practice and in clinical trials in Russia.   
The efficacy results have not been reviewed in detail since the focus/scope for this P46 is safety in 
paediatric patients with polyarticular JIA. However, it is agreed that a great majority of the included 
patients remained on the Humira therapy throughout the study, which indicates efficacy of Humira as 
well as good tolerability in the studied population (polyarticular JIA patients).  
Safety results 
A total of 4 serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded and all of them occurred in the same female 
patient; which included 2 severe SAEs (PT: encephalitis and varicella) and 2 moderate SAEs (PT: 
ataxia and meningeal disorder). The investigator attributed the SAEs of encephalitis, ataxia, and 
meningeal disorder to the SAE of varicella. For the SAE of varicella, the investigator reported no 
reasonable possible association with the use of Humira. 
It is known that the risk of infections is increased during Humira treatment including serious 
infections/opportunistic infections. SAE of varicella has been previously reported. 
The overall risk for serious infections including opportunistic infections are well covered in the SmPC 
for adalimumab. The PRAC Rapporteur considers that no new or unexpected findings were identified in

the MAH’s presentation of data (Study P17-164). However, it should be noted that there is unclearness 
in methodology regarding collecting/registering AEs. No non-serious AEs were presented in the study 
report. Absence of non-serious AEs in this study population is not very likely and it is assumed that the 
non-serious AEs were not recorded.  
No updates to the product information have been proposed by the MAH as part of this Article 46 
submission, which is endorsed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No new data has evolved from the final study report (P17-164) that has any influence on the benefit-
risk balance of Humira (adalimumab) in the treatment of patients with polyarticular JIA. It is noted that 
only one patient out of 70 is reported to have experienced an infection which is not very likely, and it is 
assumed that the AE recording has not been complete. However, the safety profile of adalimumab in 
children is well characterized, and this issue is not further pursued. The results indicating high 
persistence rate on the drug further supports the conclusion that Humira was well tolerated.  
No further actions are required. 
  Fulfilled - No regulatory action required.

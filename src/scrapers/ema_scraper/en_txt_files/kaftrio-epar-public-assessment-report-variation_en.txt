2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Kaftrio is a CFTR modulator therapy that includes the active substances elexacaftor, tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor.  
Kaftrio was approved in August 2020 in F/MF and F/F patient populations based on study results in 
F/MF (study 102) and F/F (study 103) CF patients. Long-term data from these F/MF and F/F 
populations were provided in study 105. The data of clinical studies 102, 103 and 105 indicated a large 
and maintained clinical benefit with ELX/TEZ/IVA in F/F and F/MF patients. Based on clinically relevant 
benefit and consistency of effects seen with ELX/TEZ/IVA in studies/subgroups,  extrapolation to all 
patients with an F/MF genotype was considered acceptable (i.e. also with those MF mutations not 
tested in the clinical study).During the Initial MAA - Kaftrio CHMP AR (EMEA/H/C/005269/0000), the 
applicant initially applied for a broader indication (F/any indication).  This broader indication was based 
on the idea that Kaftrio mainly acts through the F508del allele and thus all patients with an F508del 
allele could be included in the indication. While the effects in the F/MF population and all additionally 
provided information made it plausible that the ELX/TEZ/IVA mainly acts through the F508del allele 
and would also have resulted in a benefit in for example the F/RF and F/G population; the approval of 
the broad F/any indication was not supported as it was not possible to determine the added benefit of 
the triple combination over approved IVA and TEZ/IVA without a study in F/RF or F/G patients. 
In the current procedure, data in the F/RF and F/G populations are provided (study 104) and the MAH 
applied again for the broad F/any indication:  
“Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del 
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.” 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein 
is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption 
and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein results in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 8/89 
 
 
 
F508del is the most common disease-causing mutation (84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% 
of the individuals in Europe)1,2. With the proposed indication ‘F/any’, this would result in treatment 
possibility in the vast majority of the CF patients.  
Epidemiology  
CF affects approximately a total of 31,000 individuals in the United States and a total of 42.000 in the 
EU (excluding the data from Russia, Turkey and Israel)3,4. The incidence and prevalence of CF vary 
between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North America 
and Europe than in Asian and African populations. In Europe, the median age of all CF patients is 18.5 
years (with youngest patient being diagnosed just after birth and the oldest patients being 88.4 years 
of age). Despite advances in treatment, the current median age of death in a patient with CF was 
approximately 31 years in 2018, and the future predicted median age of survival is approximately 47 
years1,2. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene 
have been identified.  
CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Class I mutations: Defective protein production  
Class II mutations: Defective protein processing  
Class III mutations: Defective regulation  
Class IV mutations: Defective chloride conduction  
Class V mutations: Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein (less transcription) 
Class I, II and III usually lead to a classic (severe) CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. 
Class IV and V are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease. 
The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR), which is considered a Class II 
mutation: it prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no 
chloride transport. The decrease in the amount of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in 
the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR 
protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating and a decreased stability at the 
cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at 
the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease.  
Most of these mutations are not associated with CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 
database (an online resource that provides clinical and non-clinical data about CF-associated CFTR

mutations) contains information on 412 of these identified mutations, with sufficient evidence to define 
346 mutations as disease-causing. 
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport 
caused by the mutation. In general, a complete or near-complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is 
referred to as “minimal function” of CFTR (class I, II and III). A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated 
chloride transport is referred to as “residual function” of CFTR (class IV and V). 
The MAH uses slightly different definitions, especially when considering “minimal function” mutations.  
•  Gating mutations (G) result in a CFTR protein with a primary defect of low channel open 
probability compared to normal CFTR (comparable to Class III).  
•  Residual function (RF) mutations result in a more modest reduction in CFTR-mediated chloride 
transport than Class I mutations or minimal function mutations (comparable to Class IV). 
•  Minimal function (MF) mutations produce (1) no CFTR protein or (2) a CFTR protein that is not 
responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro. (comparable to Class I) 
For convenience, in this report, the definitions of the company will be used, and 4 different CF 
population will be described: 
•  Homozygous for F508del (F/F) 
•  Heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) 
•  Heterozygous for F508del and a gating mutation (F/G) 
•  Heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF) 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
CF is diagnosed when both of the following criteria are met 
•  Clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system (CLASSIC), or positive 
newborn screen or genetic testing for siblings of patients with CF  
AND 
•  Evidence of CFTR dysfunction (any of the following): 
o  Elevated sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L (CLASSIC) 
o  Presence of two disease-causing mutations in CFTR, one from each parental allele 
o  Abnormal nasal potential difference 
Around 2 percent of patients lack one or more of the “CLASSIC” features. They may have milder 
clinical symptoms and/or normal to intermediate sweat chloride results. These patients can still be 
diagnosed with CF if they meet genetic or functional criteria3. 
Management 
Existing treatments for CF can be broadly classified in 2 groups: (1) therapies that manage the 
symptoms, complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic 
3 Farrell PM, White TB, Ren CL, et al. Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis: Consensus Guidelines from the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation. J Pediatr 2017; 181S:S4.

enzyme replacement therapy) and (2) CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) which target 
the underlying cause of the disease. Concomitant administrations of these two groups are 
recommended to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, 
and improve quality of life. 
(1)  CF therapies currently available, including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, 
target the downstream consequences and symptoms of the disease. These therapies are 
predominantly generic medicines authorised at a national level, apart from agents for the 
management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
(2)  CFTR modulators are small molecules that target specific defects caused by mutations in the 
CFTR gene. Correctors (tezacaftor and lumacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and 
trafficking of CFTR to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators (ivacaftor) 
increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to 
the cell surface to enhance chloride transport. A combination of a corrector and a potentiator, 
should results in sufficient levels of CFTR at the surface, which is then enhanced for its gating 
function. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA), Symkevi 
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) and Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ELX/TEZ/IVA) are 
CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations. Not all CFTR genotypes are 
indicated for approved modulator therapies, and not all patients are able to tolerate the 
therapy. 
Therefore, the MAH considers that if a CFTR modulator regimen had a large enough effect on F508del-
CFTR, then the presence of a single F508del allele alone would be sufficient to derive significant clinical 
benefit. A single regimen (Kaftrio) would be effective in all patients with at least one F508del allele, 
regardless of the mutation on the second allele. If the second allele is also responsive, any benefit 
derived from that allele would be in addition to the substantial benefit derived from the robust effect 
on F508del-CFTR. Importantly, the MAH considers that for patients who have one F508del allele and 
are currently being treated with CFTR modulators (i.e., F/G and F/RF patients), their F508del allele 
seems not being fully leveraged because approved regimens primarily target the gating (IVA) or RF 
(IVA and TEZ/IVA) allele with limited modulation of the single F508del allele; these patients too would 
benefit from additional, highly effective modulation of their F508del. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg is a fixed-dose combination medicinal 
product for oral administration in tablet form. 
Kaftrio belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of other respiratory system products with ATC code 
R07AX32. 
Tezacaftor, as CFTR corrector, facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR (including 
F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, 
resulting in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor, as a CFTR potentiator, potentiates the channel-
open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride transport. Elexacaftor, as 
next-generation CFTR corrector, also facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR. The 
product is considered to have a different chemical structure and a different mechanism of action as the 
first-generation CFTR correctors (TEZ, LUM) and potentiators (IVA).  
ELX/TEZ/IVA combinations therapy is dosed orally each day in 2 tablets as follows: 
-  Morning dose: 2 fixed-dose combinations (FDC) tablets (each containing elexacaftor 100 
mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg), supplied as an orange, film-coated tablet.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 11/89 
 
 
 
- 
Evening dose: 1 tablet containing 150 mg IVA, supplied as a blue, film-coated tablet.  
The dose is to be taken approximately 12 hours apart. Both Kaftrio and Kalydeco tablets should be 
taken with fat containing food.  
Based on the study results in F/MF (study 102) and F/F (study 103) patients, and the long-term results 
of these patient populations in study 105, Kaftrio was approved in August 2020 with the following 
indication:  
“Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the 
CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1).” 
At that time, it was concluded that the presented information was too limited to claim the F/any 
indication as the evidence for the F508del-only hypothesis was considered not definitively conclusive. 
Especially the added benefit over approved therapies in the F/RF and F/G population was questioned. 
Therefore, it was concluded that the data of study 104 in F/G and F/RF patients will meaningfully 
contribute to the understanding of the efficacy in the F/RF and F/G patient populations. The data of 
study 104 were required to show a clear benefit in F/RF and F/G patients before the approval of the 
broad F508del/any indication requested by the MAH can be considered. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No advice was requested/provided in relation to the study 104 in F/RF and F/G patient specifically.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new ERA data have been submitted.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.  
The data submitted in this application are not expected to lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of elexacaftor, ivacaftor and tezacaftor.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above information, elexacaftor, ivacaftor and tezacaftor is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
However, the Ph II studies requested during the initial authorisation will need to be submitted as 
follow-up measure, as agreed, to complete the ERA assessment.

2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH has measured the pre-dose concentration values of each analyte (ELX, TEZ, IVA, and 
relevant metabolites) in study 104 and presented it as summary statistics by treatment group and for 
individual concentrations (Table 2).  
Based on an assessment of pre-dose concentrations, ELX and M23-ELX reached steady-state by Day 
15. Subjects received IVA or TEZ/IVA during the Run-in Period before Day 1; therefore, steady-state 
exposures of IVA, M1-IVA, TEZ, and M1-TEZ were achieved before entering the Treatment Period and 
were maintained through Week 8.

2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has measured the pre-dose concentration values of each analyte (ELX, TEZ, IVA, and 
relevant metabolites) in study 104 and presented it as summary statistics by treatment group 
and for individual concentrations.  
Based on an assessment of pre-dose concentrations, ELX and M23-ELX appeared to reach steady-
state by Day 15. Subjects received IVA or TEZ/IVA during the Run-in Period before Day 1; 
therefore, steady-state exposures of IVA, M1-IVA, TEZ, and M1-TEZ were achieved before 
entering the Treatment Period and were maintained through Week 8. Exposures of all analytes 
were consistent with those observed in previous ELX/TEZ/IVA studies 102 and 103 submitted for 
the initial marketing authorisation.

2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exposures of all analytes in study 104 were consistent with those observed in previous 
ELX/TEZ/IVA studies 102 and 103. Overall, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Kaftrio 
have been adequately investigated and are correctly reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study: VX18-445-104 (study 104) 
Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of 
Elexacaftor Combination Therapy in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis who are heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF Genotypes). 
Methods 
This was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre 
study. In the open-label Run-in Period, subjects were assigned to the IVA or TEZ/IVA comparator 
group based on genotype and received the approved doses of the products (See Table 3). After 
completing the run-in, subjects were randomised (1:1) to the ELX/TEZ/IVA or control group (IVA 
or TEZ/IVA).

Table 3: IVA and TEZ/IVA comparator group mutations 
Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria of study 104 were that subjects are aged 12 years and older, have FEV1 
value ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted mean for age, sex, race and height, a confirmed diagnosis of CF 
by the investigator and stable CF disease as judged by the investigator. 
In addition, subjects were heterozygous for F508del and either a gating or residual function mutation 
(F/G and F/RF genotypes) and was in a region where their genotype and age group were approved 
indications for treatment with IVA and/or TEZ/IVA 
The main exclusion criteria were:  
1.  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: 
a.  Hemoglobin <10 g/dL 
b.  Total bilirubin ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
c.  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), or gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT) ≥3 × ULN, 
d.  Abnormal renal function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤50 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study 
Equation) for subjects ≥18 years of age and ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the 
Counahan-Barratt equation) for subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive). 
2.  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation (PEx), or changes in 
therapy (including antibiotics) for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the first dose of 
study drug in the Run-in Period (Day -28) 
3.  Lung infection with microbial pathogen associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary 
status (including, but not limited to, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and 
Mycobacterium abscessus). For subjects who had a history of a positive culture, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 16/89 
 
 
 
 
investigator applied the following criteria to establish whether the subject was free of infection 
with such organisms: 
a.  The subject did not have a respiratory tract culture positive for these organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent. 
b.  The subject had at least 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for such organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent, with the first and last of these 
separated by at least 3 months, and the most recent one within the 6 months before 
the date of informed consent. 
Treatments 
The treatment regimens used in study 104 are depicted in Table 4. 
Table 4: Treatment groups and dosages 
Study drug was administered within 30 minutes of consumption of fat-containing food, such as a 
standard “CF” meal or snack by the subject. No dose modifications for toxicity were allowed. Treatment 
was however permitted to be interrupted for toxicity. If any unacceptable toxicity arose, individual 
subjects discontinued dosing. Patients were allowed to receive usual standard of care treatment as 
prescribed by their doctor for their disease, with the caveat that they were to have been stable on their 
regime for at least 28 days prior to Day -28. Subjects were permitted to receive doses of prednisone or 
prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days. Information about 
bronchodilator use during the study was collected and documented.  
Test product, batch/lot numbers:  
ELX 100-mg/TEZ 50-mg/IVA 75-mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet, TEZ 100-mg/IVA 150-mg 
FDC tablet, and IVA 150-mg tablet for oral administration. 
Reference (placebo) therapy, batch/lot numbers: 
ELX 0-mg/TEZ 0-mg/IVA 0-mg FDC tablet, TEZ 0-mg/IVA 0-mg FDC tablet, and IVA 0-mg tablet for 
oral administration. 
Because this study has recruited both F/G and F/RF genotypes and randomised them as one, there are 
2 different active controls: IVA for the F/G patients and TEZ/IVA for the F/RF patients, which is 
appropriate. Allowing SOC (provided that they were stable on this SOC for 28 days) on top of study 
treatment is appropriate.

or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes). 
Secondary Objectives:  
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
Absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
Key Secondary Endpoints:  
•  Absolute change in sweat chloride (SwCl) from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group 
•  Absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
compared to the control group 
•  Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared 
to the control group 
Other Secondary Endpoints:  
•  Absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain (RD) 
score from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
•  Absolute change in CFQ-R RD score from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
compared to the control group 
•  Safety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, 
ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
1.  Absolute change in CFQ-R non-RD scores from baseline through Week 8 
2.  Absolute change in body mass index (BMI) from baseline at Week 8 
3.  Inflammatory mediators 
4.  Blood biomarkers 
In general, the primary analyses were conducted with clinic data only. Due to the coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) pandemic, home-assessed spirometry (i.e., spirometry assessed independently by the 
subjects at home) was permitted to be performed for the pulmonary endpoints. An additional analysis 
was performed that included pooled clinic and home-assessed spirometry. 
Due to the pandemic, CFQ-R was also permitted to be performed at home. The main analysis included 
pooled CFQ-R data assessed at the clinic and at home. An additional analysis was performed that 
included only the CFQ-R data assessed at the clinic. Another prespecified analysis was performed that 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 18/89 
 
 
 
included only the CFQ-R data from subjects who completed the Week 8 Visit before the outbreak of 
COVID-19 (defined as 02 March 2020). 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The primary null hypothesis was to be tested is that the mean absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 is 0 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group. The null 
hypothesis was to be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
For the primary hypothesis, assuming a within-group standard deviation (SD) of 7.0 percentage points 
and a 10% dropout rate at Week 8, a sample size of 125 subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA arm will have 
>99% power to detect the within-group difference of 3.0 percentage points (1 sample t-test at a 2-
sided significance level of 0.05). 
Randomisation 
Following the Run-in Period, subjects were randomised 1:1 to either the ELX/TEZ/IVA group or the 
control group. Randomisation was stratified based on comparator group (IVA comparator versus 
TEZ/IVA comparator), ppFEV1 as determined during the Run-in Period (Day -14 assessment; <70 
versus ≥70), and SwCl as determined during the Run-in Period (Day -14 assessment; <30 mmol/L 
versus ≥30 mmol/L).  
Blinding (masking) 
Study 104 was a double-blind study. All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site 
personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the 
Vertex study team were blinded to the treatment codes, with the exception of the following study 
personnel: 
1.  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in 
the event of a life-threatening medical emergency 
2.  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
3.  Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing 
and reporting regulations 
4.  Vendor preparing the final (production) randomisation list 
5.  Vertex IWRS Manager 
6.  Vertex Clinical Supply Chain 
7.  IDMC 
8.  Vendor preparing the unblinded analysis of data for safety review by the IDMC 
9.  Bioanalytical contract research organisation (CRO) analysing PK samples and the Vertex 
bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the 
bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex bioanalytical study team member will continue to be blinded. 
If unblinding was needed to respond to an emergency, the unblinded treatment code was only 
revealed to those personnel who needed to know the code to respond to the safety concern.

Spirometry and SwCl results were also not revealed during the course of the study to the patients, 
investigators, or to the Vertex team- with the exception of SwCl values screening and Day -14 only.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 2.0 of the SAP is dated 22 June 2020. The SAP was amended to account for implemented 
measures to minimise risk to COVID-19 exposure. The MAH states that this was prior to database lock. 
Key changes to analyses in Version 1.0 of the SAP (06 March 2020) are summarised below: 
Table 5: Summary of Study VX18-445-104 SAP Changes 
The study completed on 12 June 2020 (date last subject completed last visit). The database lock date 
was 30 June 2020. 
Changes to the Planned analyses 
There were no changes to the planned analyses described in SAP version 2.0. 
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis sets were defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set, Safety Set for the Run-in 
Period and Safety Set for the Treatment Period. 
The All Subjects Set was to include all subjects who are randomised or received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. This analysis set was to be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition 
summary tables unless otherwise specified. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was to include all randomised subjects who carry the intended CFTR 
allele mutation and received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The FAS was to be 
used to summarise subject demographics and baseline characteristics, and for all efficacy analyses in 
which subjects were to be analysed according to their randomised treatment group unless otherwise 
specified. 
The Safety Set for the Run-in Period was to include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
TEZ/IVA or IVA in the Run-in Period. This safety set was to be included in individual subject data 
listings unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set for the Treatment Period was to include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study drug in the Treatment Period. This safety set was to be used for all safety analyses in which 
subjects was to be analysed according to the treatment they receive, unless otherwise specified.

Analysis of primary endpoint – absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
The primary efficacy variable was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Percent predicted FEV1 is the ratio of FEV1 (L) to the predicted FEV1 (L), 
expressed as a percentage. The predicted FEV1 was to be calculated using the Global Lung Function 
Initiative1 (GLI).  
The primary analysis was to be performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with the absolute change from baseline at Day 15, Week 4 and Week 8 as the dependent variable. The 
model was to include treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with 
continuous baseline ppFEV1, continuous baseline SwCl, and comparator group (IVA comparator vs 
TEZ/IVA comparator) as covariates. The model was to be estimated using restricted maximum 
likelihood. 
Denominator degrees of freedom for the F-test for fixed effects were to be estimated using the 
Kenward-Roger approximation. An unstructured covariance structure was to be used to model the 
within-subject errors. If the model estimation did not converge, a compound symmetry covariance 
structure was to be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data was 
to be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data was to be 
performed.  
The primary result obtained from the model was to be the estimated within-group treatment difference 
through week 8 (average of week 4 and week 8) for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The adjusted means with 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided P values were to be provided. Furthermore, the within-
group treatment difference at each post-baseline visit obtained from the model was also to be 
provided. The adjusted mean (with SE) obtained from the MMRM analysis at each post-baseline visit up 
to Week 8 was to be plotted by treatment group. 
The primary analysis was to be conducted with the clinic spirometry data only. An additional analysis 
may also be performed to include pooled spirometry data obtained in clinic and by Air Next Spirometer, 
if the Air Next Spirometry data are assessed to be reasonably consistent with clinic spirometry data. 
Handling of missing data in primary endpoint 
Subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment were to continue to complete all 
scheduled study visits for spirometry and other efficacy assessments. 
To assess the impact of missing data and the assumption that data are missing at random, a multiple 
imputation algorithm was to be used if at least 10% of the subjects had missing changes in ppFEV1 at 
Week 8 in any treatment group. Missing absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 assessments were to 
be imputed starting from the first visit with missing values, for which all subsequent visits through 
Week 8 are also missing. For intermediate missing data, i.e., missing values that fall between two non-
missing ones were not to be imputed as it was assumed that MAR assumption was reasonable for 
these data. An MMRM analogous to that for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint was to be 
applied to each imputed dataset (K=20) and the relevant Rubin’s rules MI estimators were to be 
reported. 
The imputation distribution for the missing absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at visit t was to 
be a normal distribution. All randomised subjects were to be classified into one of three categories 
based on the following rules:  
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 21/89 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Non-missing category: Subjects who had a ppFEV1 assessment at Week 8 (i.e., subjects who 
had a non-missing absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 8).  
•  Missing category 1: Subjects with missing absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 8, 
who discontinued treatment because of adverse events, noncompliance with study drug, death, 
or physician decision, or because the subject refused further dosing or required prohibited 
medication.  
•  Missing category 2: Subjects who discontinued treatment for any reason not listed in Category 
1 and have missing absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 8, or subjects who have 
completed 8 weeks treatment duration but are missing the absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 at visit Week 8  
The following imputation algorithm was to be implemented within each treatment group as follows:  
•  Missing category 1: randomly draw a sample from the normal distribution (
25, 
2), where 
25 is 
the 25th percentile of the non-missing absolute changes from baseline in ppFEV1 at visit t and 
𝜇𝜇
𝜎𝜎
𝜇𝜇
2 is the sample variance estimated using the non-missing absolute changes at visit t.  
•  Missing category 2: randomly draw a sample from the normal distribution (
𝜎𝜎
,2), where 
 is the 
mean of the non-missing absolute changes from baseline in ppFEV1 at visit t and 
sample variance estimated using the non-missing absolute changes at visit t.  
𝜇𝜇
2 is the 
𝜇𝜇
𝜎𝜎
Analysis of ranked secondary variables 
Sweat chloride (SwCl): the SwCl value for a given visit was to be calculated as the mean of the non-
missing sweat chloride measurements obtained on the left and right arms at that visit. If one of the 
two arm measurements at a time point was missing, the other was to be used as the mean. A volume 
of ≥15 μL is required for an accurate determination of sweat chloride. Any results reported as having 
volume <15 μL were to be considered missing. Any sweat chloride values reported as >160 mmol/L 
were to be considered missing. Any sweat chloride values reported as <10 mmol/L was to be imputed 
as 10 mmol/L. 
Analysis of absolute change in SwCl from baseline through week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group was to be based on the same MMRM similar as the primary analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint. Data obtained from the Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8 Visits were to be included in the model. 
Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 was defined as the average of Day 15, Week 4, 
and Week 8. 
Analysis of absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group compared to the control group was to be based on the same MMRM model as the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. Data obtained from the Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8 Visits 
were to be included in the model. However, the Day 15 Visit was not to be included in the estimation 
of the average treatment effect through Week 8. 
Analysis of absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group compared to the control group was to be based on the same MMRM model as the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. Data obtained from the Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8 Visits 
were to be included in the model. Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 was defined 
as the average of Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8. 
The LS mean (SE) of the within-treatment group change from baseline at each post-baseline visit up to 
Week 8 along with the 95% CI was to be estimated from the corresponding MMRM. The LS mean (SE) 
of the treatment difference between ELX/TEZ/IVA and control at each post-baseline visit was to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 22/89 
 
 
 
 
provided along with the corresponding 95% CI and P value. The LS mean (SE) at each visit was also 
be plotted by treatment group. In addition, the post-baseline raw values and the absolute change from 
baseline at each post-baseline visit up to Week 8 were to be summarised descriptively (n, mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum). 
To assess the impact of including extreme small sweat chloride values, a sensitivity analysis was to be 
conducted in which case any sweat chloride values reported as <10 mmol/L were to be considered as 
missing. This sensitivity analysis only applies to the absolute change from baseline in SwCl.  
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were to be performed using a model similar to that 
of the primary analysis for each of the following subgroups. The primary result obtained from the 
model will be estimated within-treatment difference through Week 8 (average of Week 4 and Week 8) 
for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group: 
•  Age at Screening (<18, ≥18 years) 
•  ppFEV1 at baseline (< 70, ≥ 70) 
•  Comparator group (TEZ/IVA comparator, IVA comparator) 
•  Sex (male, female) 
•  Geographic region (North America, Europe) 
The MMRM used for the primary analysis was to be used for the subgroup analysis, where the same 
model was to be applied to each category of the subgroup. Note that for the subgroup analysis based 
on comparator group, the covariate of comparator group (TEZ/IVA comparator, IVA comparator) from 
the MMRM were to be removed. The adjusted means with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be 
provided. Furthermore, estimated within-treatment differences through Week 8 (average of Week 4 
and Week 8) for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group in different categories within a subgroup were also to be 
presented in a forest plot. 
Multicentre studies 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint for geographic region (North America, Europe) 
were planned. 
Type I error control 
A hierarchical testing procedure was to be used to control the type I error rate at an alpha of 0.05 for 
the primary and key secondary endpoints. For a test at any step to be considered statistically 
significant within the testing hierarchy, it must be statistically significant, and all previous tests (if any) 
within the hierarchy must be statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The key secondary endpoints 
were to be formally tested at an alpha of 0.05 only if the primary endpoint is statistically significant. 
The testing order of the key secondary endpoints was as follows:  
•  Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
•  Absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
compared to the control group 
•  Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared 
to the control group.

Results 
Participant flow 
During the Run-in Period, 6 subjects discontinued the study for reasons related to the COVID-19 
pandemic, including 1 subject who had an AE of coronavirus infection. 
Of the 258 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period, 5 (1.9%) 
subjects discontinued treatment and the study; although no subject was diagnosed with COVID-19, 1 
subject discontinued the study for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic (physician decision due 
to restrictions for on-site visits). 
The subject disposition of the Treatment Period is depicted in Table 6.

Protocol deviations 
There were no important protocol deviations in the FAS during the Treatment Period. Compliance was 
Assessment report

Compliance was evaluated on an ongoing basis by the study team through review of missed doses, 
which were captured as protocol deviations. 
No treatment compliance issues were identified. 
A listing of subject visits impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic was provided; none of the events (e.g., 
videoconference or telephone contact visit) were considered to be IPDs. (see also conduct of the 
study). 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 96 sites in the US, Canada, EU and Australia.  
The study period was from 28 August 2019 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent 
form) to 12 June 2020 (date last subject completed the last visit). 
Patients were followed up for 28 days after study cessation, or patients moved to the open label study 
within 28 days of stopping study drug.  
Conduct of the study 
The global study protocol was amended once. The only amendment was included in all protocols in 
December 2019. Absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 8 was added as an exploratory 
endpoint to meet an FDA post-marketing commitment. 
Changes in conduct Due to COVID-19 
The MAH implemented safety measures to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue 
participation in Study 104 while ensuring their safety by minimising the risk to COVID-19 exposure 
through travel. These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority 
guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining 
compliance with GCP and minimising impact to study integrity. A summary of these measures 
pertinent to Study 104 is summarised in Table 7. 
Implemented measures were enabled based on the country and local regulations and site-level 
considerations (e.g., site closure due to COVID-19). Subjects’ study visits impacted by COVID-19 
include a small number of subjects who had blood and/or urine samples analysed at a local laboratory 
for safety monitoring. The MAH developed a cross-study local laboratory database for ease of data 
collection. 
At the time of EDC database lock for this study, the cross-study local laboratory database was still 
being validated; therefore, local laboratory data for this study were not entered and not included in 
this CSR. However, in addition to their usual review of central laboratory data, investigators were 
responsible for reviewing local laboratory data to identify potential AEs.

Concomitant medications 
Table 11 summarises concomitant medication received by at least 20% of subjects overall by PN. The 
most common concomitant medications (incidence of at least 20% of total subjects) were typically 
used for the management of CF. Table 12 summarizes concomitant medication by comparator group.

Genotypes included 
Subjects heterozygous for F508del and a gating or RF mutation listed in the protocol and in regions 
where their genotype and age group were approved indications for treatment with IVA and/or TEZ/IVA 
were eligible for the study. Only subjects with mutations that appeared in the regional mutation lists 
were included in the study. Table 13 presents the genotypes of subjects in the FAS by comparator 
group and treatment group. Among the subjects in the FAS, 14 distinct genotypes were represented in 
the TEZ/IVA comparator group, and 10 distinct genotypes were represented in the IVA comparator 
group. 
Only one mutation (in one patient) was, in the end, recruited that is not approved in the EU, the RF 
mutation R347H (and that patient received control).   
Of the 24 mutations (RF and G) recruited, 12 F/RFs and 7 F/Gs were represented (with at least one 
patient) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group; the remaining 5 were treated with appropriate control.  
The most frequently represented F/RF genotypes recruited and treated had 3849 +10kbC> T (n=39), 
2789+ 5G> A(n=34), A455E(n=22) and 3272-26A>G(n=20) as the non F allele.  The most frequently 
represented F/G genotypes recruited and treated had G551D and R117H as the second allele, each 
with n=61 and n=16 patients recruited respectively.

Treatment compliance 
Similar to the already assessed pivotal studies for ELX/TEZ/IVA, overall treatment compliance rates 
were very high in Study 104. Of the 258 subjects in the FAS there was a mean compliance of 99.6% 
overall, 99.4% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 99.7% in the control group. In both the treatment and 
control groups, 99.2% of subjects had a compliance category of ≥80%.  
Numbers analysed 
The FAS was used for efficacy analyses. There were 13 subjects in the All Subjects Set who were 
excluded from the FAS: 12 subjects discontinued the study during the Run-in Period and were never 
randomized, and 1 subject was randomized to the Treatment Period but not dosed. This left a FAS of

258 patients.  
Of the 258 patients in the FAS, 253 (98.1%) completed dosing. 5 patients discontinued during the 
treatment period (see breakdown in table 6 in the participants’ flow section), leaving 253 patients who 
completed the 8 week treatment period and the study. The percentage of subjects who discontinued 
treatment due to AE was low in both treatment groups (triple therapy group: 0.8%; control: 1.6%).

Table 14: Study 104 primary, key secondary and other secondary efficacy analyses (FAS) 
Long function endpoints: FEV1 
Rapid, robust, and statistically significant improvements in ppFEV1 were demonstrated following 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, compared to baseline values and compared to the control group (Figure 2 and 
Table 14). 
Study 104 met its primary endpoint; treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant 
improvement in ppFEV1 through Week 8, with a within-group least squares (LS) mean absolute change 
from baseline of 3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; P<0.0001 [Table 14]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021

The between-group absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 8 was evaluated as a key 
secondary endpoint. ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
ppFEV1 compared to the control group, with an LS mean treatment difference of 3.5 percentage points 
(95% CI: 2.2, 4.7; P<0.0001 [Table 14]). 
Efficacy data on the IVA and TEZ/IVA comparator groups is presented under subgroup analyses.

each visit up to Week 8. 
Sensitivity Analyses - A prespecified sensitivity analysis was performed using the multiple imputation 
method, and the results were consistent with the primary analysis. An additional analysis was 
performed that included spirometry data assessed at home by subjects due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, and the results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Sweat Chloride endpoints:  
Sweat chloride concentration is an in vivo marker of CFTR function and a sensitive PD marker of CFTR 
modulation. Rapid, robust, and statistically significant improvements in sweat chloride were

demonstrated following ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, compared to baseline and compared to the control 
group (Figure 3 and Table 14). 
Within- and between-group changes in sweat chloride through Week 8 were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints. Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
sweat chloride through Week 8, with a within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline of -22.3 
mmol/L (95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; P<0.0001 [Table 14]). ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment also resulted in a 
statistically significant improvement in sweat chloride through Week 8 compared to the control group, 
with a LS mean treatment difference of -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; P<0.0001 [Table 14]). 
Efficacy data on the IVA and TEZ/IVA comparator groups is presented under subgroup analyses.

CFQ-R endpoints:  
Rapid, robust improvements in respiratory symptoms (CFQ-R RD score) were demonstrated following 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, compared to baseline and compared to the control group (Figure 4 and Table 
14). 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 36/89 
 
 
 
 
 
Within- and between-group changes in CFQ-R RD score were evaluated as other secondary endpoints. 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an increase in CFQ-R RD score through Week 8, with a within-
group LS mean absolute change from baseline of 10.3 points (95% CI: 8.0, 12.7; nominal P-value 
<0.0001 [Table 14]). ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment also resulted in an increase in CFQ-R RD score through 
Week 8 compared to the control group, with an LS mean treatment difference of 8.7 points (95% CI: 
5.3, 12.1; nominal P-value <0.0001 [Table 14]). Both changes in CFQ-R RD scores exceeded the MCID 
of 4 points. 
The main analysis was based on pooled CFQ-R RD scores assessed at the clinic and at home. An 
additional analysis was performed that included only data assessed at the clinic, and the results were 
consistent with the main analysis.  
Efficacy data on the IVA and TEZ/IVA comparator groups is presented under subgroup analyses.

Subgroup analyses 
The results of pre-specified subgroup analyses for ppFEV1 were generally consistent with the result 
from the primary analysis. Subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had improvements in ppFEV1 regardless 
of differences in age, sex, comparator group, baseline lung function, and geographic region (see

Lung function endpoints: FEV1 
In the IVA comparator group (F/Gating subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 4.2, 7.4), and 
the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus IVA was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 
8.0 [Table 16]). In the TEZ/IVA comparator group (F/RF subjects), the within-group LS mean change 
from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 2.5 percentage points (95%

CI: 1.4, 3.5), and the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus TEZ/IVA was 2.0 
percentage points (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4 [Table 16]). 
Sweat Chloride endpoints:  
Subgroup analyses by the comparator group were performed for sweat chloride. In the IVA comparator 
group (F/Gating subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in sweat chloride through 
Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was -21.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.7, -17.8), and the between-group 
LS mean treatment difference versus IVA was -20.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -14.6 [Table 16]). In the 
TEZ/IVA comparator group (F/RF subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in sweat 
chloride through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.6, -20.6), and the 
between-group LS mean treatment difference versus TEZ/IVA was -24.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -28.4, -
21.2 [Table 16]). 
CFQ-R endpoints:  
Subgroup analysis by comparator group was performed for CFQ-R RD score. In the IVA comparator 
group (F/Gating subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in CFQ-R RD score through 
Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 10.2 points (95% CI: 6.6, 13.8), and the between-group LS 
mean treatment difference versus IVA was 8.9 points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0 [Table 16]). In the TEZ/IVA 
comparator group (F/RF subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in CFQ-R RD score 
through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 10.4 points (95% CI: 7.2, 13.7), and the between-
group LS mean treatment difference versus TEZ/IVA was 8.5 points (95% CI: 4.0, 13.1 [Table 16]). 
The treatment difference for both subgroups exceeded the MCID of 4 points. 
Responder analyses: 
Table 17 presents ppFEV1, SwCl, and CFQ-R RD score responder analyses by comparator and 
treatment groups using the same thresholds as for the overall population. In all cases, the percentage 
of responders was higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control group, and the differences 
between the treatment groups were generally substantial.

Real world data from R/G and F/RF patients  
During the assessment of the initial MAA of Kaftrio, upon request from CHMP, the MAH provided 
additional information (ppFEV1 data by genotype for patients who initiated treatment with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA before 31 Dec 2019) from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) on 
F/MF, F/F, F/G and F/RF patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA in the post-authorization setting. As 
CFFPR releases data on an annual basis, data from patients who initiated ELX/TEZ/IVA after 31 Dec 
2019 are not yet available. 
The same analysis approach described in the initial Kaftrio MAA was used to provide ppFEV1 data by 
genotype. CF patients who met the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) had a CFFPR 
record of initiating treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019, (2) 
were aged 12 years and older on the date of treatment initiation, (3) had a F/G or F/RF genotype, and 
(4) had ppFEV1 assessments available both within 90 days before (baseline) and any time after 
(follow-up) treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. 
Figure 6: Patient Population Included in the CFFPR Analyses 
Although no changes were made to the analysis period or the inclusion criteria, the number of patients 
with available data increased compared to the previous analysis, due to ongoing data entry into the 
CFFPR. In response to CHMP request, the analysis presented ppFEV1 data from 338 patients (157 F/G 
and 181 F/RF) in comparison to the data from 297 patients (136 F/G and 161 F/RF) presented in the 
Kaftrio initial MAA.  CFQ-R RD data are not routinely collected by the CFFPR and SwCl is rarely entered 
after CF diagnosis; therefore, no real-world analyses of these endpoints are presented. Analyses of 
SwCl and CFQ-R RD by-genotype based on Study 104 and Study 110 data are also presented. 
Outcomes and Data Analysis 
The most recent measurement obtained within 90 days before ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation served 
as the baseline value for the analysis. The last measurement available in the period following therapy 
initiation before 15 Mar 2020 served as the follow-up value. The change in ppFEV1 was calculated as a 
difference between the follow-up and baseline value for each patient. Data were summarized for F/G 
and F/RF subgroups, and for each CFTR genotype, using summary statistics (mean and standard 
deviation [SD]).  
Patients who initiated ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in 2019 were followed from the date of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. Treatment duration was calculated for each patient as the 
difference between the date of treatment initiation and the date of the last available post-treatment 
ppFEV1. Recent use of CFTR modulator therapy prior to ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation was defined 
as being exposed to at least one other CFTR modulator in 2019.

Results 
A total of 338 patients with an F/G or F/RF genotype started treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA between 21 
Oct 2019 and 31 Dec 2019 and had lung function measurements available at baseline and follow-up. 
Their mean treatment duration was 68.6 days. Of these patients, 157 F/G patients had a mean age of 
31.8 years and a mean treatment duration of 66.6 days. One hundred eighty-one (181) F/RF patients 
had a mean age of 39.2 years and a mean treatment duration of 70.3 days. The vast majority of the 
F/G and F/RF patients included in this analysis were receiving CFTR modulator therapy prior to 
initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment (96.8% of F/G patients and 87.3% of F/RF patients). 
F/G and F/RF Subgroup Results 
Mean baseline (SD) ppFEV1 values were 70.0 (25.9) for the F/G patients and 66.8 (24.8) for the F/RF 
patients, similar to the previous analysis. Results for the F/G and F/RF subgroups were similar to the 
analysis presented in the initial MAA. ppFEV1 increased by an average of 4.3 percentage points in the 
F/G group and by an average of 3.0 percentage points in the F/RF group (Table 18). 
Table 18: Updated CFFPR Data for F/G and F/RF Patients Who Initiated Treatment With 
ELX/TEZ/IVA Between 21 Oct 2019 and 31 Dec 2019 
Results by CFTR Genotype 
ppFEV1 data from the CFFPR before and after initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment are presented by 
genotype in Table 19 (F/G) and Table 20 (F/RF). A total of 16 genotypes were included in the analysis 
(5 F/G and 11 F/RF), including 7 genotypes (3 F/G and 4 F/RF) that are not included in the analysis of 
Study 104 data (Question 13) or Study 110 data (Question 9). Due to the limitations of Real World 
Efficacy data collection, small sample size, and associated variability of subgroups, interpretation of 
these results has limitations. 
Among the 16 CFTR genotypes with data available, an increase in ppFEV1 was observed for 14 
genotypes. For the 2 F/G (G551D, R117H) and 7 F/RF (3849+10kbC>T, A455E, 2789+5G>A, 3272-
26A>G, D1152H, L206W, and P67L) genotypes with both clinical data and real-world data available, 
results were consistent between clinical and real-world data, and showed increased ppFEV1 following 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment.

Ancillary analysis 
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
within-group effect for ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Compared to IVA:  
The between-group data show a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 5.8 
percentage point (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0; nominal p<0.0001), in SwCL of -20.0 
mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -14.6; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-RD of 8.9 
points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0; nominal p=0.0008). 
Compared to TEZ/IVA: 
The between-group data show a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 2.0 
percentage point (95% CI: 1.4, 3.5; nominal p=0.0093), in SwCL of -24.8 
mmol/L (95% CI: -28.4, -21.2; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-RD of 8.5 
points (95% CI: 4.0, 13.1; nominal p=0.0003). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The trial included adolescents and adults. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed 
using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed consistent changes 
in ppFEV1 regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function and geographic region. 
Study 104 excluded pregnant and lactating women and also excluded subjects with a history of any 
illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an additional safety risk (e.g. clinically 
significant hepatic cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension). 
The studies did include a small number of patients aged 60/65 years and older, as the maximum age is 
72.7 in the control group and 69.8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Nineteen patients over the age of 60 
years were recruited to the study. Six patients over the age of 65 years were recruited to the study 
and of these 2 were treated with Kaftrio. Of these only 1 patient had post-baseline percent predicted 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) data available. The baseline (Day 1) ppFEV1 value was 
85.7% and the average through Week 8 of Study 104 was 85.8%. 
Study 110 results are preliminary; this study is ongoing. The study was not powered for the subgroup 
analyses described below (Tables 22 through 27). 
In long-term safety and efficacy Study 110, 6 subjects ≥65 years were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
The data for these subjects are included in  
Table 22.

Study 110  
Study 110 is a Phase 3, open-label study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of VX-445 
combination therapy in subjects with cystic fibrosis who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation 
and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF Genotypes) 
The MAH has performed 2 different analyses with data from control patients from Study 104, who 
moved to Kaftrio in the OLE Study 110. Data up to 14 Dec 2020 was included. Figure 7 below 
summarises both analyses based on protocol v1.0.  
Figure 7: Schematic of Study 110 Design and Analysis 
The first analysis consisted of F/G and F/RF subgroup data analysed through Week 8, to facilitate 
comparison with results from Study 104. 
As of 14 Dec 2020, 251 subjects had received at least one dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 110 and were 
included in the OL Full Analysis Set (OL FAS), including 121 subjects who received control treatment in

Study 104 and 130 subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 104. There were 92 F/G subjects and 
159 F/RF subjects in the OL FAS. 
For study 110, the results for both control group and Kaftrio group at open-label week 8 are displayed 
in Table 23 (FEV1), Table 24 (sweat chloride) and Table 25 (CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score) and 
broken down per F/RF and F/G category. Please note that Study 110 results are preliminary; this study 
is ongoing. The study was not powered for the subgroup analyses described below (Table 23 to Table 
28). For all patients, the baseline was taken to be their Study 104 baseline, which given the relatively 
short duration of Study 104 can be accepted. The inclusion of Week 8 open-label outcomes from the 
Kaftrio group of Study 104 is useful for comparative purposes.

The second analysis consisted of genotype-level data through Week 24 of the OLE, with data from the 
Study 104 control and ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment arms pooled to maximize the sample size for each 
genotype. 
The second analysis tries to broaden the genotype level dataset with respect to efficacy (albeit with 
open label data), given the rareness of many of the non F mutations, and because half of the subjects 
recruited in Study 104 did not receive Kaftrio. To optimise the dataset, and minimise the effect of 
missing data, the MAH has pooled patients from both the control and Kaftrio arms in Study 104 
(n=251) and has selected a Study 110 week 24 cut off. Again, for all patients the baseline was taken 
to be their Study 104 baseline, which given the fairly short duration of Study 104 can be accepted for 
the purpose of this analysis.  
Only CFTR genotypes with 5 or more evaluable subjects were considered suitable for the analysis; data 
from those genotypes represented less than 5 times were considered not reliable enough to be useful. 
Table 26 lists 2 F/G genotypes, and Table 27 lists 7 F/RF genotypes and a summary of absolute change 
from Study 104 baseline in ppFEV1, SwCl, and CFQ- R RD through open label week 24 is shown for

ELX/TEZ/IVA efficacy in patients with F/MF and F/F genotypes was demonstrated in Studies 102 and

statistically significant improvements in all primary and key secondary efficacy and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) endpoints in Study 102 (Table 28) and Study 103 (Table 29).

Period in Study 104, these treatment effects should be considered compared to F/MF subjects in Study 
102 and F/F subjects in Study 103. Overall, the totality of the Phase 3 results demonstrates clinically 
meaningful improvements following ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment across all genotype groups, including F/RF.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Kaftrio is a CFTR modulator therapy that includes the active substances elexacaftor, tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor. Kaftrio was approved in August 2020 in F/MF and F/F patient populations based on study 
results in F/MF (study 102) and F/F (study 103) CF patients. Long-term data from these F/MF and F/F 
populations were provided in study 105.  
In the current procedure, data in the F/RF and F/G population are provided (study 104) and the MAH 
applies again for the broad F/any indication as follows:  
“Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.” 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy and safety of Kaftrio (ELX/TEZ/IVA) have been evaluated in 4 studies in CF patients aged 12 
years and older. The studies 102 (F/MF), 103 (F/F) and 105 (long-term) were assessed and discussed 
during the initial MAA and led to the approval of Kaftrio in F/F and F/MF CF patients. The current 
extension of indication is based on the results of study 104, a randomised, double-blind, controlled 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 53/89 
 
 
 
 
multicentre study. Study 104 was designed to provide for prescribers and patients a quantification of 
the magnitude of clinical benefit derived from VX-445/TEZ/IVA in F/G and F/RF patients, and not as a 
pivotal study. 
Comparator 
The comparators used are Kalydeco (IVA) in the F/G patients and Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) in the F/RF 
patients. These comparators are considered acceptable by CHMP. Similar to the pivotal studies, and as 
was outlined as a deficiency in the Kaftrio approval (not addressing the requirements in EMA’s 
Guideline on the clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products), only the possibility of 
ELX in combination with both TEZ and IVA has been evaluated in Study 104. The need for the TEZ 
component in both F/G and F/RF is not clear and is particularly relevant for F/Gs where the addition of 
TEZ has previously been shown in Study 109 to not provide additional response over IVA alone. 
However when the totality of the evidence for Kaftrio was considered, this was not pursued in relation 
to F/MF and F/F and will also not be pursued in this assessment focussed on F/G and F/RF genotypes. 
Duration 
The duration of the treatment period in study 104 was 8 weeks. Such a treatment period is not in line 
with the Cystic fibrosis EU guideline and important parameters such as exacerbations, and BMI cannot 
be reliably measured. However, the sustained effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been studied in F/G and F/RF 
patients in study 110 and in F/F and F/MF patients the long-term open-label extension study 105. 
Furthermore, 251 patients enrolled in the open-label study 110 (out of 253 patients who completed 
Study 104), and will provide long term safety and efficacy data for F/G and F/RF patients for up to 96 
weeks, albeit uncontrolled. Taking this into account, the current 8-week duration was considered 
acceptable by CHMP to evaluate the efficacy and safety parameters of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the F/G and 
F/RF populations.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
In general, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were very similar to the criteria for studies 102 and 103 
from the Kaftrio initial MAA. In these studies, the patient population targeted in terms of disease 
severity was moderate to severe disease, which is considered to represent the patients most likely to 
demonstrate improvement. Also, for study 104 the CF diagnosis was confirmed by the investigator and 
no longer a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis was required. 
Considering that all the subjects will have two disease-causing mutations, the minimal sweat chloride 
value is not a prerequisite for the CF diagnosis. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered 
acceptable.  
Patients with an F/G or F/RF were eligible when they were treated in a region where their genotype 
and age group were approved indications for treatment with IVA and/or TEZ/IVA. Considering that the 
indication of Kalydeco and Symkevi differ between the US and EU it could occur that patients would be 
included in the trial while their mutation is not included in the European indications. Considering the 
eligibility (see Table 3), this was the case for two gating mutations and 12 residual function mutations. 
However, of these, only one (R347H patients) has been recruited in the trials (see results genotypes). 
Therefore, the population included in the 104 trial is considered representative for the Kalydeco and 
Symkevi approved European populations.  
It is noted that the mean age of the patient population recruited is older than that recruited in the 2 
pivotal trials of ELX/TEZ/IVA: the mean age in Studies 102 and 103 was in the mid-late 20s, whereas 
for  study 104 there was a mean age of 37.7 years, with a mean age of 37.6 years in the control 
group, and 37.7 years in the treatment group. Overall, 9.3% of patients fell in the 12 to 18 year age 
bracket; slightly more in the treatment group (11.4%) than in the control group (7.1%). Both 
genotype-based comparator groups in Study 104 were older, on average, than the gating and F/RF 
subjects in previous Vertex CF programs. The minimal and maximum ages included in the studies are 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 54/89 
 
 
 
relatively similar. It is acknowledged that the older age of the F/RF subjects is caused by the different 
natural history for these patients. Thus, if the patients had a milder course, as could be hypothesised 
on their higher mean age and still reasonably well preserved pulmonary function, the observed gain 
ppFEV1 can even be considered more relevant. 
The median weight, height and body mass Index (BMI) for both treatment and control groups were 
matched, and the overall mean BMI was 24.06 (range 15.81 to 44.36). In terms of previous or 
baseline treatments, again the groups are broadly similar.  Over half of the patients had used dornase 
alpha (52.3%) or any bronchodilator (86.8%). Other common previous or baseline treatments included 
azithromycin (44.2%), inhaled antibiotic (40.7%), and inhaled hypertonic saline (43%). Overall the 2 
groups were balanced for all of these prior therapies; any of the small differences are unlikely to be 
meaningful. For most of the concomitant medication, the use was similar between the control and 
ELX/TEZ/IVA groups in each of the two separate patients populations. However, an imbalance was 
seen for Azithromycin in the F/G population (55.6% in the IVA group and 34.0% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group). The same imbalance is also seen for the prior medication. Considering all other baseline 
parameters and concomitant medication are well balanced between the IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA group, it 
is unlikely that this imbalance is caused by a difference in CF severity between these groups.  
With regard to prior medication, upon request by CHMP, the MAH provided the percentage of the 
subjects that received TEZ or TEZ/IVA prior to the study. In general, less F/RF patients were on prior 
modulator therapy compared to F/G patients. However, in the separate patient populations, the prior 
modulator use is balanced between placebo and the active treatment group.  
Mean FEV1, sweat chloride and CFQ-R scores were balanced in both treatment groups. Overall mean 
baseline ppFEV1 was 67.6%, sweat chloride was 58mmol/L, and CFQ-R RD was 76.9. These all reflect 
a slightly less severely affected patient population than the baseline F/MF and F/F populations recruited 
to Studies 102 and 103 respectively, which is not unexpected. 
Furthermore, some patients are included with baseline FEV1 values below <40 and over 90. It is 
anticipated that the inclusion criterion pertaining to screening ppFEV1 was met in all enrolled subjects 
in Study 104, but the ppFEV1 decreased at their baseline study visit. 
When viewing the baseline SwCL characteristics, it is noticed that the included populations might have 
a relative milder CF severity. Especially the SwCl values are relatively low in study 104. These baseline 
levels are measured after the 4-week TEZ/IVA or IVA run-in period. After these 4 weeks an effect of 
TEZ/IVA is indeed expected, which explains that these lower SwCL levels are comparable to SwCl 
values after IVA or TEZ/IVA treatment in the F/G and F/RF patients in registration studies for Kalydeco 
and Symkevi, respectively. Overall, a total of 59.3% of subjects had a positive test for Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa within 2 years of screening, and this rate was very similar in both treatment and control 
groups.   
In additional tables provided comparing F/G patients versus F/RF patients in terms of baseline 
demographics and disease metrics, overall the F/G patients were somewhat younger than the F/RF 
patients (mean age of 32.2 years v 40.8 years for the F/RF patients), and a higher proportion were 
male (58.9% of the F/G patients were male versus 45.4% of F/RF patients). Mean baseline FEV1 was 
comparable for both F/G and F/RF (67.0 V 67.9), as was CFQ–RD scores, however, the F/G group had 
a lower baseline SwCl of 49.3mmol/L V 63.0 mmol/L in the F/RFs. The proportion of G versus RF was, 
however, balanced in both the control and treatment arms. 
Of note, a higher number of patients overall were recruited from the F/RF genotype- 163 patients 
versus 95 patients with a F/G genotype. Overall 63.2% (approx. 2/3) had a RF mutation and therefore 
a run-in with TEZ/IVA (and TEZ/IVA as the control) while 36.8% (approx. 1/3) had a G mutation and 
had a run-in with IVA (and IVA as the control). The proportion of RF versus G was however balanced in 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 55/89 
 
 
 
both the control and treatment arms. The 10 different gating mutations in the trial are included in the 
Kalydeco product information in the EU. For the genotypes with a residual function mutation (TEZ/IVA 
comparator group), the R347H genotype is only included in the US label, but only 1 patient with this 
mutation is included in the study. The fact that distribution of the included mutations is unequal (e.g. 
over half of the IVA comparator group has the G551D mutation) is related to the prevalence of these 
mutations in the CF population. In terms of the G and RF mutations recruited, 14 RFs were recruited, 
and 10Gs were recruited, these 24 mutations are considered to cover the vast majority (> 95%) of 
patients with G and RF mutations. However not all of these were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA, only 
12RFs, and 7Gs are represented at least once in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. In order to provide a more 
complete assessment of the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA across the various G and RF mutations, the MAH 
provided an analysis of available efficacy data for the patients treated with control in 104, who then 
moved to ELX/TEZ/IVA in the open-label study 110, to see if those genotypes derived a response. 
Endpoints 
For Study 104, the primary endpoint was absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The comparison for FEV1 to the control group (IVA and TEZ/IVA treatments) is 
made as a key secondary endpoint (step 3 in the confirmatory hierarchical testing procedure). The 
absolute changes from baseline in SwCL (both with and without comparison to the control group) are 
also included as key secondary endpoints. The other secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints such 
as SwCL, CFQ-R score, and BMI are all accepted endpoints in CF clinical studies. 
Importantly, the study sample size was chosen based on power calculations for the overall 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Therefore, the study was not powered for between-group comparisons nor 
designed for subgroup analyses (F/RF and F/G). An alternative design to enable a between group 
primary comparison for F/G (ELX/TEZ/IVA versus IVA) and a between group primary comparison for 
F/RF (ELX/TEZ/IVA versus TEZ/ IVA) would have been more informative from a regulatory perspective. 
However, if the control group does not change over time (i.e. the change in this group is around 0 on 
average), the study could have sufficient power to assess between-group difference. Even if the study 
isn’t powered for this comparison, it could be seen that the control group behaves as expected in 
comparison with the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. However, as a change in the control group would bring the 
results into doubt, a formal between-group comparison is preferred and also included as secondary 
endpoint.  It should however be noted that these analyses may be underpowered depending on the 
numbers in the subgroups as discussed further below in this section. 
The same limitations as outlined above for the primary endpoints, also apply to the key secondary 
endpoints (FEV1 and SwCl). 
The remaining secondary endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity: within group and between 
group absolute change in CFQ-R RD through week 8 from baseline, absolute change from baseline in 
CFQ-R RD through week 8 in treatment versus control, and absolute change from baseline in BMI at 
week 8 in treatment versus control.   
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, also home assessments of FEV1 and CFQ-R were permitted. 
Sensitivity analyses are included to verify the results based on clinic only or on the clinic and home 
assessments. Based on the unforeseen circumstances, such an approach was considered acceptable by 
CHMP. 
Statistical Analyses 
The primary analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with 
the absolute change from baseline at Day 15, Week 4 and Week 8 as the dependent variable. The 
primary result obtained from the model was the estimated within-group treatment difference through 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 56/89 
 
 
 
 
Week 8 (average of Week 4 and Week 8) for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Similar analysis approaches were 
used for the secondary longitudinal endpoints, including the between-group treatment difference for 
ppFEV1 and SwCL. These statistical analysis approaches are in line with the analyses used to support 
the approval of the initial MAA. The statistical methods are broadly acceptable subject to the comment 
below: 
Some of the Vertex study personnel were unblinded, specifically the role of the Vertex IWRS manager 
and the Vertex Clinical Supply Chain. These roles required access to drug assignments within the IWRS 
system to package and deliver study drug, manage packaging batch records, conduct investigations 
(e.g., deviations or product complaints), and monitor sites’ study drug inventories. It can be agreed 
that these particular roles can necessitate unblinding. To maintain the integrity of the trial, unblinded 
personnel had restrictions to ensure they did not share treatment assignments with blinded personnel. 
The MMRM models used to analyse the primary and key secondary endpoints did not include 
comparator-by-treatment, comparator-by-visit and comparator-by-treatment-by-visit interaction terms 
as a fixed effects. Upon request by CHMP, the MAH provided results for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, including these three terms in the MMRM model. The results of these sensitivity analyses 
were consistent with the primary analyses. 
The MAH summarized the missing data patterns for the ppFEV1 and SwCl variables across Day 15, 
week 4 and week 8 visits by treatment and mutation class, i.e. (F/G ELX/TEZ/IVA; F/G IVA; F/RF 
ELX/TEZ/IVA; F/RF TEZ/IVA). The MAH has categorised missing data causes into two categories. The 
missing at random assumption is considered plausible for category 2 missing data (including missed 
visits due to COVID) while missing not at random is considered more plausible for category 1 missing 
data. 
The MAH as requested presented sensitivity analyses for between-group comparisons of the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 using a reference-based imputation approach for (a) 
the overall trial population and (b) each comparator subgroup. Reference-based imputation was 
performed separately by comparator group. The least-squares mean at each visit (Day 15, Week 4, 
Week 8) were provided.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
When viewing the baseline characteristics, it is noticed that the included populations might have a 
relative milder CF severity, than was included in the studies in the Symkevi and Kalydeco registration 
dossier (see Table 31). Especially the SwCl baseline values are lower in study 104 than pivotal studies 
submitted for the initial marketing authorisation. The baseline levels are measured after the 4-week 
TEZ/IVA or IVA run-in period. After these 4 weeks an effect of TEZ/IVA is indeed expected, which 
explains that these lower SwCL levels are comparable to SwCl values after IVA or TEZ/IVA treatment in 
the F/G and F/RF patients in registration studies for Kalydeco and Symkevi, respectively.

Furthermore, some patients are included with baseline FEV1 values below <40 and over 90. It is 
anticipated that the inclusion criterion pertaining to screening ppFEV1 was met in all enrolled subjects 
in Study 104, but the ppFEV1 decreased at their baseline study visit. 
In terms of the included genotypes with a gating mutation (IVA comparator group) represented in the 
clinical study, across the 95 F/G subjects, 10 different gating mutations have been represented. These 
are the 10 different mutations that are included in the Kalydeco label in the EU. For the genotypes with 
a residual function mutation (TEZ/IVA comparator group), across the 163 subjects, 14 different 
mutations have been represented. The R347H genotype is only included in the US label, but only 1 
patient with this mutation is included in the study. The S977F mutations are also included in the EU 
Symkevi label, but not included in the study. This is considered acceptable as this mutation is very rare 
(CFTR2 database only includes 13 patients with this genotype). The fact that distribution of the 
included mutations is unequal (e.g. over half of the IVA comparator group has the G551D mutation) is 
related to the prevalence of these mutations in the CF population.  
The MAH states that these 24 mutations cover the vast majority (> 95%) of patients with G and RF 
mutations; and this is agreed. However not all of these were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA, only 12RFs, 
and 7Gs are represented at least once in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. As requested by CHMP, in order to 
provide a more complete assessment of the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA across the various G and R 
mutations, the MAH provided an analysis of available efficacy data for the patients treated with control 
in 104, who then moved to ELX/TEZ/IVA in the open-label study 110 (see further below). 
With regard to prior medication, it is considered of importance to know which percentage of the 
subjects received TEZ or TEZ/IVA prior to the study. This is of importance as in the Kaftrio registration 
procedure, the ppFEV1 measurements were influenced by whether the patients were Vertex CFTR 
modulator naïve or experienced. The data at that time suggested that the screening period of 4 weeks 
may not have been sufficient for CFTR-modulator naïve patients randomized to TEZ/IVA to derive the 
full benefit of this treatment by time of baseline ppFEV1 assessment.  The MAH performed subgroup 
analysis to compare treatment effect on ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-R in patients who already have been 
on Vertex CFTR modulators at recruitment to those who were treatment naïve. In general, less F/RF 
patients were on prior modulator therapy compared to F/G patients. However, in the separate patient 
populations, the prior modulator use is balanced between placebo and active treatment group (see 
further below for efficacy results).  
Efficacy results for the total population 
For the primary endpoint, the absolute within-group change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 
of ELX/IVA/TEZ group was 3.7% (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; p<0.0001). As FEV1 is linked to mortality, any 
significant difference is considered potentially clinically relevant. The result of the sensitivity analysis, a 
MMRM based on multiple imputations (MI), was consistent with the primary analysis. The FEV1 
Assessment report

absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to the control group was a key secondary endpoint. The result of 
this analysis was consistent with the within-group changes (3.5; 95% CI: 2.2, 4.7; p<0.0001).  
Taken alone, and without considering the design and arising uncertainties regarding the interpretation, 
a gain of 3.7 ppFEV1 could be accepted as clinically relevant, while not overwhelming. However, given 
the diversity of the patients recruited (24 genotypes, both F/G and F/RF genotypes), some genotypes 
may not have gained a clinically significant amount of FEV1 function. If the absolute within-group 
improvement had been more substantial, the possibility that there may be some genotypes not gaining 
benefit would be less of a concern. As will be later discussed in this section, this concern applies in 
particular to the F/RF group. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the multiple imputation 
method to assess for impact of missing data, and results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
For the key secondary endpoint, the absolute within-group change in SwCl from baseline through week 
8 of ELX/IVA/TEZ was -22.3 (95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; p<0.0001). This reduction is considered clinically 
relevant (MCID:-10 mmol/L). The SwCl comparison with the control group was consistent and resulted 
in a reduction of 23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; p<0.0001).  
Other secondary endpoints included the change in CFQ-R RD score from baseline both within-group 
changes and compared to the control group. The additional endpoints are not under type I error 
control, and as such, can only be considered as supportive data. The within-group difference is an 
increase in score of 10.3 points (95% CI: 8.0, 12.7; nominal p<0.0001) and compared to the control 
group the treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an increase of 8.7 points (95% CI: 5.3, 12.1; 
nominal p<0.0001). A difference of over 4 points in CFQ-R RD score is considered to be clinically 
relevant. Other CFQ-R domains (Physical and Vitality) indicated an improvement with the triple 
combination compared to the comparator group.  
Upon request by CHMP and in order to establish the proportion of the treatment group that achieved a 
meaningful gain in FEV1, SwCL and CFQ-R RD, a responder analysis was provided for the primary 
outcome using a threshold of 1.5% and 2.5% ppFEV1, and separately by comparator group. 
Substantial increases in the proportion of ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-R RD responders were observed with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to the control arms. With ELX/TEZ/IVA, 49.6% of the patient benefited of over 
2.5% in ppFEV1, compared to 22.8% in the control group. A very similar effect size was seen for SwCL 
and CFQ-R RD score. 
For ppFEV1 and also for the CFQ-R additional analyses were performed, including spirometry data from 
a home-setting and CFQ-R data from only the clinic setting. These also showed consistent results with 
the main analyses for these endpoints.  
Nevertheless, a downside of the current study design is that the effect in the separate F/G and F/RF 
population was not tested. Since these populations usually have a different CF severity and because 
the standard CFTR modulator is different in these population, it was considered important to see 
whether an additional benefit was seen when treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA over the approved therapy IVA 
or TEZ/IVA. Considering the hypothesis that the mechanism of action is mainly through the F508del 
allele, a beneficial effect over the approved therapies would have been expected. ELX/TEZ/IVA might 
also act via the non-F508del allele. Therefore, a difference in effect size might be present between 
subjects with a gating or a residual function mutation. Therefore, the MAH was requested to include 
also analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints per genotype/comparator group (F/G and 
F/RF); those are discussed below 
F/G population 
In the F/G population, TEZ/IVA dual therapy (which mainly works on the non-F508del allele) did not 
result in a clinically relevant benefit. As ELX/TEZ/IVA is suggested to act trough the F508del allele, an 
effect over IVA is anticipated in this population. Within-group and between-group analyses for ppFEV1, 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021

SwCL and CFQ-R RD in the F/G population were provided. Consistent with the within-group difference, 
the between-group data showed a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 5.8 percentage point (95% CI: 3.5, 
8.0; nominal p<0.0001), in SwCL of -20.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -14.6; nominal p<0.0001) and in 
CFQ-R RD of 8.9 points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0; nominal p=0.0008). These results are all considered 
clinically relevant, and indicated that the ELX/TEZ/IVA has a beneficial effect in the F/G population over 
IVA monotherapy. The gain in ppFEV1 seen in the F/G group was in line with the expectations based 
on the ‘treat the F’ treatment paradigm (effect on F508Del allele) put forward by the MAH. The 
cumulative effect of the 3 agents is very similar to what was achieved in F/MF CF patients. 
F/RF population 
Based on the MAHs F508del hypothesis, ELX/TEZ/IVA would be expected to generate a positive clinical 
outcome in the F/RF population. Consistent with the within-group difference, the between-group data 
showed a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 2.0 percentage point (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4; nominal p=0.0093), 
in SwCL of -24.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -28.4, -21.2; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-R RD of 8.5 points 
(95% CI: 4.0, 13.1; nominal p=0.0003). The magnitude of effects on SwCl and CFQ-R with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA were similar when compared to the F/G population. However, the ppFEV1 benefit was 
lower, with an increase of 2.0 percentage points compared to TEZ/IVA. This increase was lower than 
initially expected. Based on the response to ELX/TEZ/IVA seen in F/F and F/MF patients, and the ‘treat 
the F theory’ it would be anticipated that treating an F/RF patient with ELX/TEZ/IVA might bring a total 
gain in ppFEV1 of approximately 14%. A greater response with F/RF patients would have been 
anticipated with the triple combination compared to the reasonably modest ppFEV1 6.8% observed in 
Study VX14-661-108 with TEZ/IVA over placebo. It would have been expected that the F/RF patients 
should have gained more in ppFEV1 than the F/G patients, whereas in fact, the F/G patients seem to 
have gained a better response. 
A similar pattern was noticed in the real-world US registry data, where F/G patients also seemed to get 
a better response to triple combination versus F/RF patients. While it is agreed that a gain of 2% over 
TEZ/IVA can be considered clinically relevant for patients with an F/RF genotype, some uncertainties 
remained on whether all F/RF patients will have achieved a clinically meaningful response. 
The reason why F/RF subjects had lower ppFEV1 improvements on ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to F/MF, 
F/F, and F/G subjects was unclear, but it may be related to reduced severity of CF in F/RF patients. RF 
mutations, which are generally Class IV or Class V, cause a more modest reduction in CFTR function 
compared to Class I, II, and III mutations, such as MF mutations, the F508del mutation, and the 
G551D mutation, respectively. As a result, untreated patients with RF mutations have a less severe CF 
phenotype, characterized by later diagnosis, lower baseline SwCl, a lower prevalence of pancreatic 
insufficiency, and a slower pace of lung function decline compared to patients with Class I, II, and III 
mutations; however, they continue to have signs and symptoms of CF and premature mortality. These 
differences in RF patients’ underlying disease progression and age at diagnosis may impact the 
potential for CFTR modulator treatment to increase ppFEV1. 
Nevertheless, overall the totality of the data supported conclusions of an effect, with a 95% CI 
between 0.5 and 3.4 percentage points. Although, an MCID for FEV1 cannot be defined, according to 
the “EMA report of the workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical trials” dated 2012, a treatment 
effect equivalent to the average annual loss in FEV1 can be considered as clinically relevant. Based on 
published literature, the annual rate of ppFEV1 decline in RF patients is around 0.70. When excluding 
R117H patients from the cohort, the annual decline is -1.05. Considering these annual decline rates, 
the 2.0 percentage point was ultimately considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, clinically relevant 
improvements in SwCL and CFQ-R further supported the efficacy of Kaftrio in F/RF CF patients.  
To put the efficacy results in the F/RF population into perspective. In the initial Symkevi procedure 
(study VX14-661-108), TEZ/IVA showed improvements over placebo of ppFEV1 of 6.8 percentage 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 60/89 
 
 
 
points, -9.5 mmol/L in SwCl and of 11.1 points in CFQ-R in the F/RF population. When compared to 
IVA monotherapy the benefit in ppFEV1 was 2.1 percentage points, and for CFQ-R it was 1.4 points 
increase.  
In total, the efficacy outcomes for ELX/TEZ/IVA are considered to show a clinically relevant 
improvement over the approved control therapy IVA or TEZ/IVA in the F/G and F/RF population, 
respectively.  
The applicant has provided requested data from subjects 65 years and older. Although the preliminary 
data from ongoing Study 110 are limited to 6 patients and the study was not powered for a subgroup 
analysis of subjects at least 65 years of age, the data provide an idea on the benefit in these older 
patients. Nevertheless, the numbers remain insufficient to determine whether responses in these 
patients is different from younger adults. The paragraphs on elderly patients already included in the 
SmPC section 5.2 remain appropriate. 
Additional analyses performed by comparator group 
As indicated above, the main interest lays in the effect in the two separate comparator groups. To 
evaluate the effects in the F/G and F/RF populations further and more in depth, some additional 
analysis were requested and performed by the MAH. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional 
sensitivity analyses were done for pooled clinic and home assessment of the ppFEV1 and or clinic only 
CFQ-R scores. The MAH provided these analyses also for the subgroups by the comparator. Results 
were consistent with the original subgroup analysis per comparator subgroup. 
The MAH has also performed subgroup analyses for age, sex, baseline lung function, and geographic 
region per comparator subgroup. In general, the results of these subgroup analyses were also 
consistent with the overall results per comparator group.   
In addition, the MAH performed subgroup analysis to compare treatment effect on ppFEV1, SwCl and 
CFQ-R in patients who already have been on Vertex CFTR modulators at recruitment to those who 
were treatment naïve. In general, a beneficial effect is seen for all three parameters in both patients 
CFTR modulators experienced and CFTR modulator naïve. However, in the F/RF population the effects 
on ppFEV1 (1.7% vs 2.8%) and SwCL (-16.4 mmol/L vs -28.7 mmol/L)  seem to be less pronounced in 
the patients who were already treated with an Vertex CFTR modulator compared to those who were 
treatment-naive. Although it is generally accepted that a run-in period of 4 weeks is sufficient to obtain 
an on-treatment baseline, these efficacy results suggest that a maximum effect might not be 
completely established after 4 weeks. This was also reflected in the results of the comparator groups. 
Therefore, the overall data in F/RF reflect mainly the results of the 2/3 of the patients who were not on 
prior Vertex CFTR modulator treatment before inclusion in Study 104. However, the limited number of 
patients hampers a firm interpretation of these results. Moreover, the efficacy outcomes for SwCL and 
CFQ-R RD score in both patients with and without prior CFTR modulator therapy are still highly 
clinically relevant. Therefore, these results do not further influence the B/R assessment. Also, per 
comparator subgroup, responder analyses were performed. Substantial increases in the proportion of 
ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-RD responders are observed for the TEZ comparator group. While more modest 
increases are observed for the TEZ/IVA comparator group, these could still be considered clinically 
relevant. 
Data from follow-up study 110 suggest that patients treated with control in Study 104 and who then 
switched to Kaftrio in Study 110 had improvements in ppFEV1, SwCl, and CFQ-R that are very similar 
to those seen in Study 104 treatment group, in both the F/G and F/RF categories at week 8. While the 
preliminary data from ongoing Study 110 are limited and the study was not powered for these 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 61/89 
 
 
 
 
 
subgroup analyses, the analyses are supportive of the results of Study 104. The data also suggest that 
the gains in the Kaftrio treated group of Study 104 were maintained in Study 110.  
Updated registry data were presented for those patients with F/G and F/RF genotypes. ppFEV1 
increased by an average of 4.3 percentage points in the F/G group and of 3.0 percentage points in the 
F/RF group. The RWE analysis further confirms the beneficial effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA seen in study 104. 
To identify the robustness of the effect and see whether different gating and residual function mutation 
might influence the effect size, it is of interest to see the clinical benefit in a subset based on specific 
mutations. Genotype level data were provided for Study 104, Study 110 and for the updated registry 
data. For almost all of the genotypes included in both the F/G and F/RF categories, clinical benefit of 
some degree can be seen, and in most cases, can be considered meaningful.  
Overall, the presented additional analyses can be considered to support the conclusions of Study 104 
and suggest that patients with  F/G or F/RF mutation types improved with Kaftrio over currently 
approved therapy. 
In study 104 patients representing a total of 24 mutations (RF and G) were recruited, 12 F/RFs and 7 
F/Gs were represented (with at least one patient) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group; the remaining 
5 were treated with appropriate control. Information on additional mutations were also provided from 
study 110 and the real-world effectiveness registry data. For almost all of the genotypes included in 
both the F/G and F/RF categories, clinical benefit of some degree can be seen, and in most cases, it 
can be argued to be meaningful. Overall, the CHMP considered that the totality of the data provides 
sufficient information on patients with RF and G mutations but also to conclude that Kaftrio works in 
patient with at least one F508del mutation.  
Indication 
Overall, Kaftrio is currently approved for F/F and F/MF mutations and demonstration of efficacy has 
been demonstrated in F/RF and F/G patients as discussed in this application. The CHMP therefore 
agreed with the applicant, that hypothesis of efficacy based at least an F508del mutation on one allele 
is demonstrated and considered the broad indication approvable: 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy outcomes for ELX/TEZ/IVA in study 104 are considered to show a clinically relevant 
improvement in ppFEV1, SwCL, and CFQ-R RD score over the approved control therapy IVA or TEZ/IVA 
in the F/G and F/RF populations, respectively.  
Based on these results, the added benefit of the triple combination over approved therapies can be 
determined, and its plausibility that the ELX/TEZ/IVA is mainly acting through the F508del allele is 
considered now demonstrated.  
The effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the F/MF (study 102), F/F (study 103), F/RF (study 104) and F/G (study 
104) population and the maintained effects as seen in study 105 are sufficient to conclude on the 
benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the entire CF population of patients aged 12 years and older with at least 
one F508del allele.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA was characterized based on a comprehensive review of data from 
the clinical development program described in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA MAA, which included over 700 
subjects who had received at least 1 dose of ELX as monotherapy or as part of a triple combination 
regimen. 
The safety profile was mainly based on the pivotal study in patients with F/MF mutations. Long-term 
safety data were evaluated in the ongoing open-label extension Study 105, which included 271 
subjects with ≥48 weeks of cumulative ELX/TEZ/IVA exposure (through IA2).  
Overall, ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 
generally mild or moderate in severity. Important AEs observed with incidence rates ≥ 3% and ≥1% 
more frequent than placebo are influenza, wheezing and hypoglycaemia.    
In Study 102, Grade 3-4 AEs were reported for 9.4% (ELX/TEZ/IVA) vs. 7.5% (placebo) of patients. 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs with an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (4.5%, placebo), blood creatine increased (2.0%, ELX/TEZ/IVA), ALT 
increased (1%, ELX/TEZ/IVA), and AST increased (1%, ELX/TEZ/IVA).  
SAEs were reported for 13.9% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 20.9 % in the placebo group. The SAEs 
that occurred in ≥1% of patients in either treatment group were infective PEx of CF (5.4% vs. 16.4%), 
haemoptysis (1.0% vs. 1.5%) and rash (1.0% vs. 0.5%) and influenza (1.5% vs 0%). Related SAEs 
occurred in 3.0% (ELX/TEZ/IVA) vs. 1.0% (placebo). No related SAEs occurred in 2 or more patients in 
either treatment group. 
Rash occurred more frequently in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (10.9%, 22 subjects) than in the placebo 
group (6.5%, 13 subjects).  
AEs of CK elevation occurred more frequently in subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared to the 
placebo group. The majority were asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were preceded 
by exercise. The two subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group presented with AEs of rhabdomyolysis with CK 
elevations did not have clinical features of rhabdomyolysis.   
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred were low. 
The long-term safety data (Study 105 Safety Set, OLS) showed decreased exposure-adjusted event 
rate of (related AEs), Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs with ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to the Study 102 Safety Set. 
In the Cumulative Safety Set, the safety profile is quite similar to the safety profile of Study 102 Safety 
Set.  
The Study 104 Safety Set in CF patients with F/G and F/RF mutations includes all subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Study 104 Treatment Period (i.e., does not include 
subjects who were only dosed in the IVA or TEZ/IVA Run-in Period).  
Patient exposure 
A total of 258 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The exposure 
was similar between treatment groups. The mean exposure was 8.0 (0.7) weeks for the 132 subjects 
in ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7.9 (0.9) weeks for the 126 subjects in the control group (Table 32).

The Study 104 Safety Set and Full analysis Set were identical.  
Adverse events 
In the Treatment Period, 88 (66.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 83 (65.9%) subjects in 
the control group had at least 1 AE.  
Table 33 presents an overview of AEs. 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had a 
serious AE (SAE). Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 4 (3.2%) subjects in the control 
group had severe AEs; all other subjects with AEs had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. One 
(0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that led 
to study drug discontinuation. Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in 
the control group had AEs that led to study drug interruption.

Table 33 Summary of AEs - Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
In general, the safety pattern in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group is quite similar to the safety in the control 
group. A majority of all AEs were mild to moderate. There were no deaths arising from treatment in 
either group. Small differences were observed for grade 3/4 AEs and related AEs (more subjects in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group) and (related) SAEs (more subjects in the control group). 
Treatment-emergent AEs 
Table 34 presents common AEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects in either treatment group. 
Overall, the common AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF 
disease in CF subjects 12 years of age and older or the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
The majority of the common AEs had a lower incidence in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control 
group. AEs with a higher incidence in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (alanine transaminase [ALT] increased, 
aspartate transaminase [AST] increased, and abdominal pain) are all known adverse drug reactions for 
Assessment report

ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment observed in previous studies. The same 8 subjects had AEs of ALT increased 
and AEs of AST increased.  
Table 34 AEs Occurring in ≥5% of Subjects in a Treatment Group by PT - Treatment Period 
(Safety Set)
Headache was the most frequent AE in both groups. After headache, in subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group, the most frequent AEs were ALT and/or AST increased and abdominal pain, while in subjects in 
the control group, these were sputum increased, diarrhoea, nausea, cough, and infective PEx. 
Transaminase raises were previously shown to be more common with ELX/TEZ/IVA than with TEZ/IVA. 
This pattern has also been observed in the marketing authorisation. However, the numbers of events 
are much lower, which can be attributed to the much shorter exposure to study treatment. 
AEs by Relationship 
The majority of AEs were assessed by the investigator as not related or unlikely related to study drug. 
Thirty (22.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 22 (17.5%) subjects in the control group had 
an AE assessed as possibly related. Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and no subjects in 
the control group had an AE assessed as related.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs were defined as AEs related to elevated transaminases and AEs related to rash.  
Elevated Transaminase Events 
Eight (6.1%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group had at least 
1 elevated transaminase event, none of which were serious. Of the 8 subjects who had AEs of 
transaminase elevations in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 5 had modest ALT or AST elevations (<3 × ULN), 
and 2 had ALT or AST elevations >3 to ≤5 × ULN. The remaining 1 subject had ALT >8 × ULN, and 
AST >5 × ULN and discontinued study drug and the study. No subjects in the control group 
discontinued study drug due to AEs of transaminase elevations. No subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group interrupted study drug due to AEs of transaminase 
elevations. No subjects had transaminase elevations with concurrent total bilirubin elevations. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, elevated transaminase events had a mean (SD) duration of 19.4 (7.8) days 
and mean (SD) time-to-onset of 18.3 (19.6) days. The 1 elevated transaminase event in the control 
group had a duration of 16.0 days and time-to-onset of 1.0 day.

for the Treatment Period 
Rash Events 
Four (3.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 (4.0%) subjects in the control group had at 
least 1 rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity. No rash event was serious or led 
to study drug discontinuation. Rash events resulted in study drug interruption for 1 (0.8%) subject in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 1 subject with rash events was male and 3 subjects were female, none of 
whom were taking hormonal therapy. In the control group, 2 subjects with rash events were male and 
3 subjects were female, 2 of whom were taking hormonal therapy. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, the mean (SD) duration of rash events was 6.0 (3.2) days and the mean 
(SD) time-to-onset was 25.8 (14.0) days. In the control group, the mean (SD) duration of rash events 
was 16.4 (19.7) days and mean (SD) time-to-onset was 18.0 (17.0) days.

Influenza 
Influenza is listed as a common AE in the SmPC for ELX/TEZ/IVA and is also listed in Section 4.8 for 
IVA.  In Study 104 there were only 4 cases of influenza listed as an AE in total, 2 each for both the 
treatment (1.5%) and control (1.6%) groups. Influenza appears to have been less frequent in Study 
104 and there was no increase seen in the treatment group vs control.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths reported. 
Other SAEs 
SAEs were more common in the control group than in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Five (3.8%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had at least 1 SAE. 
SAEs of infective PEx occurred in 2 (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7 (5.6%) subjects 
in the control group; all other SAEs occurred in no more than 1 subject per treatment group. 
Table 38 Serious AEs by PT–Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
The majority of SAEs were assessed by the investigator as unlikely related or not related to study 
drug. Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and no subjects in the control group had an AE 
assessed as related.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
There were no clinically relevant trends in haematology parameters in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group or the 
control group. 
Overall, AEs related to haematology were infrequent (no PT occurred in more than 1 subject  
(Table 40). None of the AEs related to haematology was serious or led to treatment discontinuation or 
interruption. 
Non-LFT chemistry  
There were no clinically relevant trends in mean values of other non-LFT chemistry parameters. 
Overall, AEs related to non-LFT chemistry parameters were infrequent (no PT occurred in more than  
2 subjects in a treatment group) and had a similar overall incidence between treatment groups  
(Table 40). 
None of these AEs was serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption.

LFT 
Mean concentrations of LFT parameters were variable over time, but remained within normal range in 
both groups. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 4 (3.2%), 1 (0.8%), and 1 
(0.8%) subject(s), respectively (Table 41). In the control group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN 
occurred in 2 (1.6%), 1 (0.8%), and 0 subject(s), respectively. There were no subjects with ALT or 
AST >3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN in either group.

Table 41 Threshold Analysis of LFT Chemistry Parameters - Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
Bilirubin 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, increases from baseline in mean (SD) total bilirubin were observed, with a 
maximum increase of 3.8 (6.5) μmol/L at Week 4. The maximum increase in direct bilirubin in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 1.1 (1.5) μmol/L at both Week 4 and Week 8. There were no clinically relevant 
trends in total bilirubin or direct bilirubin in the control group. 
The majority of subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range. In the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group, total bilirubin >2 and >3 × ULN occurred in 6 (4.8%) subjects and 2 (1.6%) 
subjects, respectively. In the control group, 1 (0.8%) subject had total bilirubin >2 × ULN and no 
subjects had total bilirubin >3 × ULN. 
Vital Signs 
Modest increases in blood pressure (BP) were observed. Overall, the findings were consistent with the 
results of previous ELX/TEZ/IVA studies described in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA MAA.  
At baseline, the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had a mean (SD) systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 118.5 (13.8) 
mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 72.1 (9.5) mmHg). The control group’s baseline mean 
(SD) SBP was 117.4 (15.4) mmHg and DBP was 72.2 (9.7) mmHg. SBP and DBP increased during the 
treatment period in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The largest mean (SD) increase in SBP from baseline was 
3.0 (12.4) mmHg (at Week 8) and the largest mean (SD) increase in DBP was 2.5 (8.9) mmHg (at 
Week 8). There were no clinically relevant trends in SBP or DBP in the control group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 73/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SBP >140 mmHg occurred in 16 (13.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and in 12 (9.9%) 
subjects in the control group. DBP >90 mmHg occurred in 16 (13.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group and 6 (5.0%) subjects in the control group. 
There were no AEs of hypertension in either treatment group. One (0.8%) subject in the control group 
had an AE of hypotension. 
There were no clinically relevant trends in temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, or pulse oximetry. 
Safety in special populations 
Adolescents 
A total of 9 adolescents were enrolled in the control group and 15 adolescents in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group.  
Of the subjects <18 years of age at screening, 6 (40.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 
(55.6%) subjects in the control group had at least 1 AE in the Treatment Period. 
No subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had serious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs, or AEs that led to study 
drug discontinuation. One (11.1%) subject in the control group had severe SAEs in the SOC of 
psychiatric disorders that led to study drug discontinuation. No subjects in either treatment group had 
AEs that led to study drug interruption. 
Most AEs in subjects <18 years of age at screening occurred in no more than 1 subject per treatment 
group by Preferred Term. AEs of headache and abdominal pain occurred in 2 (13.3%) subjects in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (33.3%) subjects in the control group. Overall, the AEs were mostly 
consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF disease in CF subjects ≥12 to <18 years 
of age or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions remains unchanged.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that 
led to study drug discontinuation (Table 42). In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 1 subject discontinued due to 
severe AEs of ALT increased and AST increased, which were not serious and assessed as possibly 
related to study drug. In the control group, 1 subject discontinued IVA treatment due to a moderate 
SAE of infective PEx of CF, which was assessed as not related to study drug, and 1 subject 
discontinued IVA treatment due to SAEs in the SOC of psychiatric disorders, which were assessed as 
possibly related to study drug.

Table 42 AEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation by PT -Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
Adverse Events That Led to Interruption of Study Drug 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the control group had AEs 
that led to study drug interruption. All of the subjects resumed study drug, except for 1 subject whose 
interruption occurred in Week 8 (Day 58). All AEs that led to study drug interruption occurred in 1 
subject each. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, AEs that led to study drug interruption included pruritus, rash 
macular, tinnitus, tongue ulceration, bilirubin conjugated increased, blood bilirubin increased, and C-
reactive protein increased. In the control group, AEs that led to study drug interruption included 
urticaria, gastritis, and LFT increased.  
Post marketing experience 
ELX/TEZ/IVA (Trikafta) was approved on 21 October 2019 (International Birth Date) in the US. 
ELX/TEZ/IVA (Kaftrio) was approved in the EU on 21 August 2020. Over 17,000 patients have been 
treated with commercial ELX/TEZ/IVA, representing more than 5,800 patient-years.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
General overview  
The Study 104 Safety Set included 258 subjects, of which 132 subjects in ELX/TEZ/IVA group 126 
subjects in the control group. 
There were 88 (66.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 83 (65.9%) subjects in the control 
group with at least one AE. Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 4 (3.2%) subjects in 
the control group had severe AEs. 
The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were headache, ALT 
increased, AST increased, and abdominal pain. The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
in the control group were headache, cough, infective PEx of CF, nausea, sputum increased, and 
diarrhoea. 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had SAEs. 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Infective PEx of CF occurred in 2 (1.5%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 75/89 
 
 
 
 
subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7 (5.6%) subjects in the control group; all other SAEs occurred 
in no more than one subject per treatment group. There were no life-threatening AEs and no deaths. 
One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation (ALT 
increased and AST increased), and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that led to study 
drug discontinuation (1 subject with an SAE of infective PEx of CF and 1 subject with SAEs in the SOC 
of psychiatric disorders). Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the 
control group had AEs that led to treatment interruption.  
Rash events (AESI of rash) occurred in 4 (3.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 (4.0%) 
subjects in the control group. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, one subject with rash event was male, and 3 
subjects with rash events were female, none of whom were taking hormonal therapy. All rash events in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were mild or moderate in severity. 
Eight (6.1%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group had an 
AESI of elevated transaminases; the majority of events were mild or moderate in severity, and none 
were SAEs. One (0.8%) subject discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment due to AEs of ALT increased and 
AST increased. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 4 (3.2%), 1 (0.8%), and 1 
(0.8%) subject(s), respectively. In the control group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 2 
(1.6%), 1 (0.8%), and 0 subject(s), respectively. No subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with 
concurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. 
Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. 
Neither AE was serious or resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment discontinuation or interruption. No 
subject in the control group had an AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. 
Mean SBP and DBP increased in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The largest mean (SD) increase in SBP from 
baseline was 3.0 (12.4) mm Hg (at Week 8) and the largest mean (SD) increase in DBP was 2.5 (8.9) 
mm Hg (at Week 8). No subjects had AEs related to increased blood pressure. 
There were no clinically relevant trends in other laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, or 
PEs. 
In Study 104, there was a higher frequency of transaminase elevations in the threshold analysis. 
Elevated transaminases are a known AE of ELX/TEZ/IVA. There are no new insights in this AESI. They 
are already addressed in the SmPC and RMP. No changes are proposed. Overall, the safety results 
appeared generally consistent with the known safety profile; no new safety concerns were identified on 
the provided data.  
Study 104 is unusual in that both F/G and F/RF genotypes were combined and randomised as one 
group. No comparison of safety between F/G and F/RF genotypes has been provided. However, there 
is an overall low incidence of severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to low discontinuation/interruption across 
both the combined treatment group and combined control group, and no life-threatening AEs or AEs 
leading to death in either group. The safety data and AE profile from the combined F/G and F/RF group 
are also consistent with those in both F/F and F/MF genotype groups, and it is not anticipated that 
there would be a difference in safety in F/G v F/RF genotypes. For these reasons the value of a 
subgroup analysis by genotype group (F/G and F/RF) for safety is considered limited in terms of 
characterising safety in F/G v F/RFs.   
The applicant has provided requested data from subjects 65 years and older. Although the preliminary 
data from ongoing Study 110 are limited to 6 patients, the data provide an idea on the benefit in these 
older patients. Nevertheless, the numbers remain insufficient to determine whether responses in these 
patients is different from younger adults. The paragraphs on elderly patients already included in the 
Assessment report

SmPC section 5.2 remain appropriate.

N/A 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
A total of 9 adolescents were enrolled in the control group and 15 adolescents in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group.  The safety was generally consistent with the overall study population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated for 8 weeks. 
Overall, the safety seen in Study 104 were consistent with either the common manifestations or 
complications of CF disease or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. No new safety concerns 
were identified, but the number of subjects in the new safety set is relatively small and limited in 
terms of duration of follow up. However, the MAH agreed to include patients with F/G and F/RF 
mutations in the planned PASS category 3 study to gather additional long term safety data post 
approval. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: since 
the revised text proposed within the package leaflet (PL) is shorter, simpler, and nearly identical to the 
text that was successfully user-tested, this does not present a substantial change and therefore no 
new readability testing is included with this submission. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by 
mutations in the CFTR gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell 
surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of 
salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs 
results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Lung disease is the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in people with CF. F508del, is the most common disease-causing mutation 
(84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% of the individuals in Europe)4,5. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Two types of CF therapies are currently authorised. The use of CF therapies that target the symptoms 
of the disease (such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics), in combination with CFTR 
modulators (i.e. correctors and potentiators) is recommended to maintain and improve lung function, 
reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations; and improve quality of life. 
Correctors (such as tezacaftor and elexacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
mutant CFTR to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced 
chloride transport. CFTR potentiators (like ivacaftor) enhance the channel gating activity of the CFTR 
which is delivered to the cell surface by correctors.  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA), Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, 
TEZ/IVA) and Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ELX/TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved 
for CF patients with specific mutations.  
The claimed indication by the M AH is as follows: “Kaftrio (ELX/TEZ/IVA) is indicated in a combination 
regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 
years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.” 
This proposed indication covers the F/F genotypes and F/MF ‘minimal function’ genotypes in which 
Kaftrio is already approved. However, this broad indication would also include the F/G ‘gating’ 
genotypes and F/RF ‘residual function’ genotypes in which, approved modulator therapies are available

(IVA and TEZ/IVA). Nevertheless, these treatments do not cure the disease, and more efficacious 
treatments could fulfil this gap in these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence for the efficacy of Kaftrio was presented in the marketing authorisation application, 
for heterozygous patients with minimal function mutations (F/MF (study 102) and F/F homozygous 
patients (study 103) and the follow-up study 105. The main evidence for the extension of the 
indication to a broad population of patients with at least one F508del allele is obtained from one clinical 
trial, study 104, where heterozygous patients with additional type of mutations are studied; patients 
with gating mutations (F/G) and patients with residual function mutations (RF). 
Study 104 in CF patients 12 years and older is an 8-week randomized, double-blind, controlled study in 
subjects heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and 
F/RF genotypes). A total of 258 subjects received at least one dose of study drug. Ivacaftor was used 
as control treatment in patients with an F/G genotype and tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with an F/RF 
genotype. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline for the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group (within-group change).  
ppFEV1 as a surrogate endpoint is a well-established endpoint, and a reduction in the decline of FEV1 
is related to improved survival.  
Pulmonary exacerbations and decline of lung function have an impact on survival in cystic fibrosis and 
reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions of the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
CF patients included in study 104 (both F/G and F/RF) 
ELX/TEZ/IVA showed an absolute within-group change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 of 
ELX/IVA/TEZ group of 3.7% (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; p<0.0001). The FEV1 absolute change in ppFEV1 
compared to the control group was a key secondary endpoint. The result of this analysis was 
consistent with the within-group changes (95% CI: 3.5%; 2.2, 4.7; p<0.0001).  
The absolute within-group change in SwCl from baseline through week 8 of ELX/IVA/TEZ was -22.3 
(95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; p<0.0001). The SwCl comparison with the control group resulted in a reduction 
of 23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; p<0.0001). 
For the CFQ-R RD score, the within-group difference was an increase in score of 10.3 points (95% CI: 
8.0, 12.7; nominal p<0.0001) and compared to the control group the treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA 
resulted in an increase of 8.7 points (95% CI: 5.3, 12.1; nominal p<0.0001). 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring ELX/TEZ/IVA were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups: age, sex, comparator group, baseline lung function, and geographic region. 
In all cases, the percentage of responders (ppFEV ≥ 2.5%, SwCL <30 mmol/L, CFQ-R RD change ≥ 4 
points) was higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control group, and the differences between 
the treatment groups were substantial. 
CF patients 12 year and older with F/G genotype 
Ad-hoc subgroup analyses were performed in the comparator subgroups, which are based on the two 
different genotypes included in the study. In the F/G population, the between-group data showed a 
beneficial change of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in ppFEV1 of 5.8 percentage point (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0; 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 82/89 
 
 
 
nominal p<0.0001), in SwCL of -20.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -14.6; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-
RD of 8.9 points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0; nominal p=0.0008) compared to IVA monotherapy. 
CF patients 12 years and older with F/RF genotype 
The patients with an F/RF genotype were also analysed as an ad-hoc subgroup. The between-group 
data showed a beneficial change of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in ppFEV1 of 2.0 percentage point (95% 
CI: 0.5, 3.4; nominal p=0.0093), in SwCL of -24.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -28.4, -21.2; nominal p<0.0001) 
and in CFQ-RD of 8.5 points (95% CI: 4.0, 13.1; nominal p=0.0003) compared to TEZ/IVA 
combination therapy. 
Several additional analyses were provided, including COVID-19 sensitivity analyses and subgroup 
analyses per comparator subgroup, analyses based on experienced or naïve CFTR modulator patients, 
and analyses in subsets of specific mutations. Also, more recent registry data were provided. All these 
additional analyses resulted in consistent outcomes compared to the outcomes as presented above.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
CF patients included in study 104 (both F/G and RF) 
The study is not powered for between-group comparisons, but a formal between-group comparison is 
made. The subgroup analyses for the F/G and F/RF genotypes separately are performed ad-hoc. 
Efficacy data are based on study 104 of 8 weeks duration. The sustained effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA has 
been previously shown in in study 102 and the long-term open-label extension study 105. Long term 
efficacy data for F/R and F/G patients are provided based on study 110 but remain limited. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, also home assessments of FEV1 and CFQ-R were permitted. This 
introduces limitations, but the approach is reasonable based on the unforeseen circumstances.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated; 88 (66.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 83 
(65.9%) subjects in the control group experienced at least one AE, with only five (3.8%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 4 (3.2%) subjects in the control group had severe AEs. 
The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were headache, ALT 
increased, AST increased, and abdominal pain. The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
in the control group were headache, cough, infective PEx of CF, nausea, sputum increased, and 
diarrhoea. 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had SAEs. 
Infective PEx of CF occurred in 2 (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7 (5.6%) subjects in 
the control group; all other SAEs occurred in no more than one subject per treatment group. There 
were no life-threatening AEs and no deaths. 
One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation (ALT 
increased and AST increased), and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that led to study 
drug discontinuation (1 subject with an SAE of infective PEx of CF and 1 subject with SAEs in the SOC 
of psychiatric disorders). Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the 
control group had AEs that led to treatment interruption.  
Rash events (AESI of rash) occurred in 4 (3.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 (4.0%) 
subjects in the control group. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, one subject with rash event was male, and 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/206350/2021  
Page 83/89 
 
 
 
subjects with rash events were female, none of whom were taking hormonal therapy. All rash events in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were mild or moderate in severity. 
Eight (6.1%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and one (0.8%) subject in the control group had an 
AESI of elevated transaminases; the majority of events were mild or moderate in severity, and none 
were SAEs. One (0.8%) subject discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment due to AEs of ALT increased and 
AST increased. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 4 (3.2%), 1 (0.8%), and 1 
(0.8%) subject(s), respectively. In the control group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 2 
(1.6%), 1 (0.8%), and 0 subject(s), respectively. o No subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with 
concurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. 
Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. 
Neither AE was serious or resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
Mean SBP and DBP increased in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The largest mean (SD) increase in SBP from 
baseline was 3.0 (12.4) mm Hg (at Week 8) and the largest mean (SD) increase in DBP was 2.5 (8.9) 
mm Hg (at Week 8). No subjects had AEs related to increased blood pressure. 
A total of 9 adolescents were enrolled in the control group and 15 adolescents in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group.  The safety was generally consistent with the overall study population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Study 104 provides safety data on ELX/TEZ/IVA in F/G and F/RF patients for up to 8 weeks. There are 
no further data provided with this variation application regarding longer-term safety. However, there 
are controlled safety data from Study 102 (in F/MF) up to week 24 and Study 105 open-label extension 
interim analysis data (both F/F and F/MF)  (271 subjects had an exposure of ≥48 weeks), which can be 
used to support the longer-term safety in patients with F/G and F/RF genotypes. Additionally, the MAH 
was requested to amend the planned Post authorisation safety study to include patients with F/RF and 
F/G mutation in order to further characterise safety in the post approval setting. 
Study 104 is unusual in that both F/G and F/RF genotypes were combined and randomised as one 
group. No comparison of safety between F/G and F/RF genotypes has been provided. However, there is 
an overall low incidence of severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to low discontinuation across both the 
combined treatment group and combined control group, and no life-threatening AEs or AEs leading to 
death in either group. Therefore, it is considered that a sub-analysis by genotype group (F/G and F/RF) 
for safety would be of limited value. The safety data and AE profile from the combined F/G and F/RF 
group are also consistent with those in both F/F and F/MF genotype groups, and it is not anticipated 
that there would be a difference in safety in F/G versus F/RF genotypes.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The submitted F/any indication was based on the hypothesis that Kaftrio mainly acts though the 
F508del allele and that all patients with an F508del allele could be included in the indication. During 
the initial marketing authorisation assessment, the effects in the F/MF population and all additionally 
provided information made it plausible, but not definitively conclusive that the ELX/TEZ/IVA mainly 
acts through the F508del allele and would result in a benefit in all patients with at least one F508del 
allele. A study in F/RF or F/G patients was considered required to determine the added benefit of the 
triple combination over approved IVA and TEZ/IVA and further assess the MAH hypothesis. Clinical 
data from study 104 are provided in this application in the F/RF and F/G patients for whom other CFTR 
modulators are already approved. 
According to the MAH, if a modulator has a large effect on the F508del-CFTR, then the presence of a 
single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a clinical benefit. Based on this hypothesis and the 
results from studies 102 and 103, a broad indication was initially proposed to include all patients with 
at least one F508del mutation independently of the second allele. This meant that efficacy for non-
tested populations of F/MF, F/RF and F/G should be extrapolated.  
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference of 3.5 percentage points (p<0.0001) between ELX/TEZ/IVA and the control 
group in an absolute change of ppFEV1 is well above the predefined threshold (3%, to have >99% of 
power).

Separate F/G and F/RF efficacy outcomes are important to be determined as these populations usually 
have a different CF severity and because the standard CFTR modulator is different. In F/G patients and 
F/RF patients, a difference of 5.8 percentage points (p<0.0001) and 2.0 percentage points (p<0.0093) 
were seen compared to IVA and TEZ/IVA, respectively. 
Considering the natural evolution of the disease in CF patients in study 104, the observed effect is 
considered clinically relevant (see below). 
Strength of the evidence 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring ELX/TEZ/IVA were observed across the prespecified 
subgroups. The results of the primary parameter are supported by all key secondary parameters. CFQ-
R respiratory domain and sweat chloride both showed improvements above the Minimum Clinically 
important Difference (MCID). Also, in the comparator subgroups (F/RF and F/G populations) the CFQ-R 
respiratory domain and sweat chloride both showed improvements well above the MCID. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
The comparator subgroups were tested ad-hoc, but still able to provide a good effect size for the 
efficacy parameters over the control groups.  
The overall clinical benefit seen on ppFEV1, SwCL and CFQ-R with ELX/TEZ/IVA in the F/RF and F/G 
patients has such a large effects sizes, that it is unlikely that uncertainties related to for example 
sensitivity analyses and previous modulator use will affect the data in such an extent that this benefit 
could be questioned. 
The study duration was only 8-weeks. However, the sustained effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been 
sufficiently shown in study 102 and the long-term open-label extension study 105 in the initial MAA. 
Safety 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated for 8 weeks.  The safety results appear consistent 
with the safety established in the clinical development program in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA MAA. No new 
safety concerns were identified, but the new safety set is relatively small. Safety will be further 
characterised in the safety study to be conducted post approval as previously agreed at time of the 
initial marketing authorisation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy 
In the overall population (F/G and F/RF), a clinical benefit is demonstrated for the primary and 
secondary endpoints. Due to differences in severity and standard of care, the two separate 
subpopulations (F/RF and F/G) are considered equally important.  
For CF patients with the F/G genotype, the IVA-controlled part of the study provided efficacy data that 
demonstrate that ELX/TEZ/IVA provides a substantial clinical benefit, both in the primary and the key 
secondary endpoints. These results are considered robust and clinically relevant. 
For CF patients with the F/RF genotype, the TEZ/IVA controlled part of the study provided efficacy data 
demonstrating substantial clinical benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA both in the primary and the (key) secondary 
endpoints. The results are regarded as clinically relevant for both populations. 
To identify the robustness of the effect and see whether different gating and residual function 
mutations might influence the effect size, it is of interest to see the clinical benefit in a subset based on 
specific mutations. In study 104, patients representing a total of 24 mutations (RF and G) were 
recruited, 12 F/RFs and 7 F/Gs were represented (with at least one patient) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
Assessment report

treatment group; the remaining 5 were treated with appropriate control. Information on additional 
mutations were also provided from study 110 and the real-world effectiveness registry data. For 
almost all of the genotypes included in both the F/G and F/RF categories, clinical benefit is observed, 
and in most cases, it can be considered clinically meaningful. Overall, the CHMP considered that the 
totality of the data provides sufficient information on patients with F/RF and F/G mutations but also to 
conclude that Kaftrio provides efficacy in patients with at least one F508del mutation.  
Indication 
Overall, Kaftrio is currently approved for F/F and F/MF mutations and demonstration of efficacy has 
been demonstrated in F/RF and F/G patients as discussed in this application. The CHMP therefore 
agreed with the applicant, that hypothesis of efficacy based at least a F508Del mutation on one allele 
is demonstrated and considered the below broad indication approvable: 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene 
Safety 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated for 8 weeks. The safety results appear consistent 
with the safety established in the clinical development program in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA marketing 
authorisation. No new safety concerns were identified.  As a consequence of this extension of 
indication the MAH was requested to update the planned PASS to include also patients with F/FR and 
F/G mutations. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk of Kaftrio is positive.

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan EMEA-002324-PIP01-17 and the results of these studies are reflected in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kaftrio is not similar to Kalydeco, Symkevi, TOBI 
Podhaler and Bronchitol within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

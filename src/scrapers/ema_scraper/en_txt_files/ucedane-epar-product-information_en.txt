1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Ucedane 200 mg dispersible tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 200 mg of carglumic acid. 
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Dispersible tablet. 
The tablets are rod-shaped, white and biconvex with three score lines on both sides and engraving 
“L/L/L/L” on one side. Approximate tablet dimensions are 17 mm in length and 6 mm in width. 
The tablet can be divided into four equal doses. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ucedane is indicated in treatment of  
•  hyperammonaemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase primary deficiency. 
•  hyperammonaemia due to isovaleric acidaemia.  
•  hyperammonaemia due to methymalonic acidaemia.  
•  hyperammonaemia due to propionic acidaemia.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Ucedane treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced  in the 
treatment of metabolic disorders. 
Posology 
•  For N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency:  
Based on clinical experience, the treatment may be started as early as the first day of life.  The initial 
daily dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. 
It  should  then  be  adjusted  individually  in  order  to  maintain  normal  ammonia  plasma  levels  (see 
section 4.4). 
In  the  long  term,  it  may  not  be  necessary to  increase  the  dose  according  to  body  weight  as  long 
as  adequate  metabolic  control  is  achieved;  daily  doses  range  from  10  mg/kg  to  100 mg/kg. 
Carglumic acid responsiveness test 
It  is  recommended  to  test  individual  responsiveness  to  carglumic  acid  before  initiating  any long 
term treatment. As examples 
- 
In a comatose child, start with a dose of 100 to 250 mg/kg/day and measure ammonia 
plasma concentration at least before each administration. It should normalise within a  few 
hours after starting Ucedane. 
In  a  patient  with  moderate  hyperammonaemia, administer  a  test  dose  of  100  to 
200 mg/kg/day  for  3  days with  a  constant  protein  intake  and  perform  repeated 
determinations  of  ammonia  plasma  concentration  (before  and  1  hour  after  a  meal);  adjust 
the dose in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels.

•  For isovaleric acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia:  
The treatment should start upon hyperammonaemia in organic acidaemia patients. The initial daily 
dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250  mg/kg if necessary.  
It should then be individually adjusted in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels (see 
section 4.4). 
Renal impairment: 
Caution is advised when administering Ucedane to patients with impaired renal function.  
Dosage adjustment is required according to GFR. 
•  Patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 59 mL/min) 
o 
o 
the recommended initial dose is 50 mg/kg/day to 125 mg/kg/day for patients 
presenting an hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency or organic acidaemia, 
In the long term use the daily dose will be in the range of 5 mg/kg/day to 
50 mg/kg/day and should be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal 
ammonia plasma levels. 
•  Patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 29 mL/min) 
o 
o 
the recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day for patients 
presenting an hyperammonaemia due to NAGS deficiency or organic acidaemia, 
In the long term use the daily dose will be in the range of 2 mg/kg/day to 
20 mg/kg/day and should be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal 
ammonia plasma levels. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of Ucedane for the treatment of pediatric patients (birth to 17 years of 
age) with acute or chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency and acute hyperammonemia 
due to IVA, PA or MMA have been established, and based on these data, posology adjustments in 
neonates are not deemed necessary. 
Method of administration 
This medicine is for oral use ONLY (ingestion or via nasogastric tube using a syringe, if necessary). 
Based on pharmacokinetic data and clinical experience, it is recommended to divide the total daily 
dose into two to four doses to be given before meals or feedings. The breaking of the tablets in halves 
allows most of the required posology adjustments. Occasionally, the use of quarter tablets may also 
be useful to adjust the posology prescribed by the physician.  
The tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5-10 mL of water and ingested immediately or 
administered by fast push through a syringe via a nasogastric tube. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding during the use of carglumic acid is contraindicated (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Therapeutic monitoring 
Plasma levels of ammonia and amino acids should be maintained within normal limits. 
As  very  few  data  on  the  safety  of  carglumic  acid  are  available,  systematic  surveillance  of  liver, 
renal, cardiac functions and haematological parameters is recommended. 
Nutritional management 
Protein  restriction  and  arginine  supplementation  may  be  indicated  in  case  of  low  protein 
tolerance.

Use in patients with renal impairment 
The dose of Ucedane must be reduced in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Ucedane contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum daily dose that is to 
say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No specific interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For carglumic acid no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. 
Animal  studies  have revealed  minimal  developmental  toxicity  (see section 5.3). Caution should 
be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
Although  it  is  not  known  whether  carglumic  acid  is  secreted  into  human  milk,  it  has  been 
shown  to  be  present  in  the  milk  of  lactating rats  (see section  5.3).  Therefore,  breast-feeding during 
the use of carglumic acid is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies 
are  defined  as:  very  common  (≥1/10),  common  (≥1/100  to  <1/10),  uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In one patient treated with carglumic acid, where the dose was increased up to 750 mg/kg/day, 
symptoms  of  intoxication  occurred  which  can  be  characterised  as  a  sympathomimetic  reaction: 
tachycardia,  profuse  sweating,  increased  bronchial  secretion,  increased  body  temperature and 
restlessness. These symptoms resolved once the dose was reduced.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Amino acids and derivatives; ATC code: A16AA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Carglumic acid is a structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate, which is the naturally occurring 
activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, the first enzyme of the urea cycle. 
Carglumic  acid  has  been  shown  in  vitro  to  activate  liver  carbamoyl  phosphate synthetase. 
Despite a  lower  affinity  of  carbamoyl  phosphate  synthetase  for  carglumic  acid  than  for 
N-acetylglutamate,  carglumic  acid  has  been  shown  in  vivo  to  stimulate  carbamoyl  phosphate 
synthetase and to be much more effective than N-acetylglutamate in protecting against ammonia 
intoxication in rats. This could be explained by the following observations: 
i) The  mitochondrial  membrane  is  more  readily  permeable  for  carglumic  acid  than  for 
N-acetylglutamate 
ii) Carglumic  acid  is  more  resistant  than N-acetylglutamate  to  hydrolysis  by  aminoacylase present 
in the cytosol. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Other studies have been conducted in rats under different experimental conditions leading to 
increased ammonia availability (starvation, protein-free or high-protein diet). Carglumic acid  was 
shown  to  decrease  blood  ammonia  levels  and  increase  urea  levels  in  blood  and  urine,  whereas 
the  liver  content  of  carbamoyl  phosphate  synthetase  activators  was  significantly  increased. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, carglumic acid was shown to induce a rapid 
normalisation of plasma ammonia levels, usually within 24 hours. When the treatment was instituted 
before any permanent brain damage, patients exhibited normal growth and psychomotor development. 
In patients with organic acidaemia (neonates and non-neonates), the treatment with carglumic acid 
induced a quick decrease of ammonia plasma levels, reducing the risk of neurological complications. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid has been studied in healthy male volunteers using both 
radiolabelled and unlabelled product. 
Absorption 
After a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, approximately 30% of carglumic acid is 
estimated to be absorbed. At that dose-level, in 12 volunteers given carglumic acid tablets, plasma 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration peaked at 2.6 μg/mL (median; range 1.8-4.8) after 3 hours (median;  range 2-4). 
Distribution 
The plasma elimination curve of carglumic acid is biphasic with a rapid phase over the first 
12 hours after administration followed by a slow phase (terminal half-life up to 28 hours). 
Diffusion into erythrocytes is non existent. Protein binding has not been determined. 
Biotransformation 
A proportion of carglumic acid is metabolised. It is suggested that depending on its activity,  the 
intestinal bacterial flora may contribute to the initiation of the degradation process, thus  leading 
to a variable extent of metabolism of the molecule. One metabolite that has been identified in the 
faeces is glutamic acid. Metabolites are detectable in plasma with a peak at  36-48 hours and a 
very slow decline (half-life around 100 hours). 
The end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, which is eliminated through  the 
lungs. 
Elimination 
After a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the 
urine and up to 60% in the faeces. 
Plasma levels of carglumic acid were measured in patients of all age categories, from  newborn 
infants to adolescents, treated  with various daily doses (7–122  mg/kg/day). Their  range was 
consistent with those measured in healthy adults, even in newborn infants. Whatever  the  daily 
dose,  they  were  slowly  declining  over  15  hours  to  levels  around  100 ng/mL. 
Special Populations 
Patients with Renal Impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with 
subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of carglumic acid 
40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg. The Cmax and AUC0-T of carglumic acid are summarized in the table below. 
The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC0-T in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were 
approximately 1.8 (1.34, 2.47), 2.8 (2.17, 3.65), and 6.9 (4.79, 9.96), respectively. Renal clearance 
(CLr) decreased by 0.79-, 0.53-, and 0.15-fold in mild, moderate and severe renal impaired subjects, 
respectively, when compared to subjects with normal renal function. It is considered that the PK 
changes of carglumic acid accompanied with impaired renal function are clinically relevant, and 
dosage adjustment on the dose would be warranted in moderate and severe renal impaired subjects 
[see Posology and method of administration (4.2)].

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology studies  have  shown  that  carglumic acid  administered  orally at  doses  of 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
250,  500,  1000  mg/kg  had  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  respiration, central  nervous 
system and cardiovascular system. 
Carglumic acid  showed  no  significant  mutagenic  activity  in  a  battery  of  genotoxicity  tests 
performed  in  vitro  (Ames  test,  human  lymphocyte  metaphase analysis)  and  in  vivo 
(micronucleus test in rat). 
Single doses of carglumic acid up to 2800 mg/kg orally and 239 mg/kg intravenously did not 
induce any mortality or abnormal clinical signs in adult rats. In newborn rats receiving daily 
carglumic acid by oral gavage for 18 days as well as in young rats receiving daily carglumic acid 
for 26 weeks, the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was established at 500 mg/kg/day  and the 
No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was established at 1000 mg/kg/day. 
No  adverse  effects  have  been  observed  on  male  or  female  fertility.  In  rats  and  rabbits  no 
evidence has been seen of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity up to maternotoxic doses 
leading  to  fifty  times  exposure  as  compared  to  humans  in  rats  and  seven  times  in  rabbits. 
Carglumic  acid  is  secreted  in  the  milk  of  lactating  rats  and  although  developmental parameters 
were  unaffected,  there  were  some  effects  on  body  weight  /  body weight  gain  of  pups  breast-fed 
by  dams  treated  with  500  mg/kg/day  and  a  higher  mortality  of  pups  from  dams  treated  with 
2000 mg/kg/day,  a  dose  that  caused  maternotoxicity.  The  maternal  systemic exposures after  500 
and 2000 mg/kg/day  were twenty  five  times and seventy times the expected human exposure. 
No carcinogenicity study has been conducted with carglumic acid.

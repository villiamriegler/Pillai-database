1.  Introduction 
On April 29, 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Crysvita, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The study is listed as a requirement of the 
Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP). 
This is also an application for a Post Approval Measure (PAM) to address the specific obligation number 
1 (SOB 1) as outlined in Annex II.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Crysvita was granted conditional approval on 19 February 2018 for the treatment of X-linked 
hypophosphataemia with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children 1 year of age and older and 
adolescents with growing skeletons.  
The current study is part of the clinical development program as it is one of the three special 
obligations for a potential full approval in the paediatric population, as listed below.  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Crysvita is currently not approved for treatment in adult subjects.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Most (45/52, 87%) were receiving commercially available product. Two were receiving burosumab 
under a temporary authorization, 2 were receiving burosumab under the Sponsor’s Ultra Care Bridge, 
and 3 were receiving burosumab per an early access scheme.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  Study UX023-CL201: A Randomized, Open-Label, Dose Finding, Phase 2 Study to Assess the 
Pharmacodynamics and Safety of the anti-FGF23 Antibody, KRN23, in Pediatric Patients with X-
linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a hereditary disease characterized by high levels of circulating 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lead to excessive urinary phosphate excretion and subsequent 
hypophosphataemia (Figure 1).

Crysvita is a fully human monoclonal antibody designed to bind and thereby inhibit the excessive 
biologic activity of FGF23.  
The European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) for Crysvita on 19 
February 2018 for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia with radiographic evidence of bone 
disease in children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons. The EU launch date 
was April 2018.  
The benefits and risks of burosumab in children with XLH were demonstrated in the original MAA based 
on the single-arm studies UX023-CL201 and UX023-CL205. Data up to Week 64 for all subjects in 
Study UX023-CL201 were available at the time for the CMA. For a full approval, the MAH should 
complete the following studies as specific obligations: 
•  UX023-CL201 
•  UX023-CL205 
•  UX023-CL301  
In an ongoing variation (EMEA/H/C/4275/II/04), Week 64 data from the confirmatory phase 3 Study 
UX023-CL301, is currently under assessment.

Study UX023-CL201: A Randomized, Open-Label, Dose Finding, Phase 2 Study to Assess the 
Pharmacodynamics and Safety of the anti-FGF23 Antibody, KRN23, in Paediatric Patients with X-linked 
Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
Description 
Methods 
Assessor’s comment 
The methodology for Study UX023-201 was thoroughly assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/4275 at the 
original marketing approval for Crysvita and is therefore only briefly summarised below.  
Study design 
UX023-CL201 was a randomized, multicentre, open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 study assessed the PD, 
efficacy, and safety of burosumab in prepubescent children (5 to 12 years old) with X-linked 
Hypophosphatemia (XLH) (Figure 1).

Figure 2: Schema for Study UX023-CL201 
The goal of the Treatment Extension Period I (Weeks 64 to 160) was to evaluate the long-term safety 
and efficacy of burosumab. During the Treatment Extension Period I, all subjects received burosumab 
Q2W. Analyses of long-term safety and efficacy was conducted during and at the completion of 
Treatment Extension Period I.  
Subjects could choose to end participation in the study at Week 160 and complete an EOS efficacy visit 
(referred to as EOS I). For subjects who chose to continue after Week 160, the study also included a 
Treatment Extension Period II (up to 56 weeks). The aim of the Treatment Extension Period II (Weeks 
160 to 216) was to continue to provide burosumab treatment to study subjects until the availability of 
a separate rollover study (or other mechanism of treatment) or through September 2018, while also 
continuing to collect long-term safety and efficacy data. The duration of Treatment Extension Period II 
varied for individual subjects and was determined by the time from Week 160 through the EOS II Visit. 
During the Treatment Extension Period II, all subjects received burosumab Q2W. 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 30 subjects with XLH and radiographic evidence of bone disease (“pre-expansion 
subjects”) were planned for enrolment. The study was expanded to include additional subjects 
(“expansion subjects”) who were required to have rickets severity of at least 1.5 at the knee (per the 
Rickets Severity Score [RSS] method), for a total of approximately 50 subjects planned overall. 
The main eligibility criteria were age 5-12, diagnosis of XLH, low serum phosphorus and radiographic 
evidence of active bone disease (or, for expansion subjects, an RSS score in the knee of at least 1.5).  
Treatments 
All subjects received burosumab Q2W or Q4W at doses given in Figure 1. Dosing was then adjusted 
individually according to a pre-established protocol. From Week 64, all subjects were treated Q2W.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy analysis was change from Baseline in severity of rickets as measured by RSS total 
score assessment of wrist and knee radiographs. The primary analysis for efficacy and safety endpoints 
was Week 40. 
Key PD endpoints were serum phosphorus, serum 1,25(OH)2D, and ratio of renal tubular maximum 
reabsorption rate of phosphate (TmP) to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (TmP/GFR). 
Statistical Methods 
Statistical tests were 2-sided at the alpha=0.05 significance level, and 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were used. All p-values were presented as nominal p-values. No adjustment on 
multiplicity was made. For the primary efficacy endpoint of change in RSS total score, the difference 
between the 2 dose regimens (Q2W and Q4W) was summarized with 95% CIs. 
For repeated measures, the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach was used for assessing 
the change over time. The GEE model included regimen, study visit and interaction between regimen 
and study visit as categorical variables.  
Results 
Assessor’s comment 
This AR focusses on data from the not previously assessed Treatment Extension Period I and II, i.e. 
week 64-160 and week 160 to End of study. Data up to week 64 was thoroughly assessed in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/4275 at the original marketing approval for Crysvita and are therefore not repeated here. 
Subject disposition and baseline data are briefly summarised.  
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 52 paediatric subjects were enrolled into the study and were randomized 1:1 to the Q2W (26 
subjects) and Q4W (26 subjects) regimens. All 52 subjects completed 160 weeks on study, and no 
subject discontinued from the study.  
Per subjects’ Safety Follow-up visits or telephone calls, all 52 subjects were receiving burosumab after 
their last dose on Study UX023-CL201. 
Baseline data 
Sex: 28 (54%) females; 24 (46%) males 
Age: mean (SD): 8.5 (1.87) years; range: 5 to 12 years 
Race: 89% White, 4% Black or African-American, 8% Other 
Dosing 
Mean burosumab dose per administration at Week 64 for the Q2W group was 1.05 mg/kg and for the 
Q4W group 1.01 mg/kg. At Week 160, the mean dose was 1.05 mg/kg and at Week 190 1.07 mg/kg. 
By Week 214, data were available for only 3 subjects.

Q4W→Q2W dosing. SE bars are displayed only at selected visits. 
Phosphate Reabsorption 
Renal phosphate reabsorption is impaired in patients with XLH due to excess FGF23. TmP/GFR is a 
measure of renal phosphate reabsorption, the primary mechanism by which FGF23 regulates 
phosphate homeostasis by comparing the fractional absorption of phosphate relative to the estimated 
rate of glomerular filtration, which provides insight into the degree to which phosphate is being 
reabsorbed relative to the amount of glomerular filtrate.

EFFICACY RESULTS 
RSS Total Score Change from Baseline (Primary Efficacy Endpoint) 
The Thacher Rickets Severity Score (RSS) is a radiographic scoring system that was developed to 
assess the severity of nutritional rickets in the wrists and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal 
fraying, lucency, and cupping, as well as the proportion of growth plate affected. A single, central, 
independent rater performed all RSS ratings for all radiographs for this study. For the RSS assessment, 
disease improvement is expressed as a negative number, i.e., decreased severity of rickets. The usual 
range of observed scores for subjects with XLH is between 0 and 6.5, depending on severity and prior 
treatment. 
RSS total score are presented in Figure 6. At Week 160, 10 subjects had fused or partially fused 
growth plates, and 1 subject did not have a wrist X-ray; therefore, RSS total score was available for 41 
subjects.  
At the EOS, 1 additional subject had fused growth plates.

Note: Starting at Week 64, all subjects received burosumab Q2W. 
Assessor’s comment 
Efficacy as determined by RSS was maintained to Week 160, even though the percent change from 
baseline in the Q2W group was lower at Week 88 and Week 160 compared to Week 40 (-55%, -54% 
and -61%, respectively). Seven subjects in the Q2W arm were excluded from the Week 160 analysis 
due to fused or partially fused growth plates.  
RSS Responder Analysis 
RSS data were analysed using the prespecified responder definition, i.e. subjects with a Baseline RSS 
total score ≥ 1.0 (m) who had a reduction in RSS total score from Baseline of at least 1.0 at the 
indicated time point (n)

Assessor’s comment 
After Week 64, the RSS responder rate gradually decreases in the Q2W population. A similar 
development is not seen in the Q4W arm, presumably due to the dose increase to Q2W at Week 64.  
In the Q2W arm, responder rate was 80% (16/20) at Week 64, 70% (14/20) at Week 88 and 57% 
(8/14) at Week 160. The difference in population between Week 64 and Week 160 is explained by a 
number of subjects being excluded from the Week 160 analysis due to fused or partially fused growth 
plates.  
RGI-C Scores 
The RGI-C (Radiographic Global Impression of Change) utilizes a 7-point ordinal scale to evaluate the 
extent of healing in a radiograph as compared with a radiograph taken at a prior time point. Ratings of 
-3, -2, and -1 between the 2 time points assessed indicate severe, moderate, and minimal worsening, 
respectively, and ratings of +1, +2 and +3, indicate minimal healing, substantial healing, or 
complete/near complete healing, respectively. Unlike the RSS system, for which radiographs are 
individually scored independent of any other radiographs, clinical significance is explicit in RGI-C due to 
the comparison with a previous radiograph. Three paediatric radiologists not affiliated with the conduct 
of the study and contracted by a central imaging facility independently evaluated and provided RGI-C 
scores for pairs of wrist, knee, and long leg radiographs. The average of the scores assigned by the 3 
independent raters were used for analysis. For the RGI-C assessment, in contrast with RSS 
assessment, disease improvement is expressed as a positive number, i.e., increased healing of rickets. 
Only 41 subjects were evaluable for analysis of RSS at Week 160; 10 subjects had fused growth 
plates, and 1 subject did not have a wrist X-ray. A sensitivity analysis conducted on the 41 subjects 
with open growth plates at Week 160 showed RGI-C scores over time that were consistent with the 
overall study population.

Assessor’s comment 
The validity of the RGI-C scoring was thoroughly discussed in procedure EMEA/H/C/4275 at the original 
marketing approval for Crysvita. 
Efficacy as determined by RGI-C was maintained to Week 160. 
Serum markers of rickets – ALP and BALP 
Total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases (ALP and BALP) are elevated in the presence of rickets, 
and the magnitude of elevation correlates with the magnitude of rickets.

Assessor’s comment 
Decrease in ALP and BALP continued from Week 64 to Week 160.  
At Week 160, the mean ALP level was 312 (88) U/L. The reference range for ALP varies with age and 
gender with upper and lower limit of normal for the study population at approximately 297-362 U/L 
and 42-96 U/L, respectively. 
Changes in standing height 
Change in standing height was assessed as velocity (assessed using a model-based approach based on 
all standing height data obtained during the study) (Table 3), Z score, and percentile for age and 
gender.

height Z-score at baseline as covariates, with exchangeable covariance structure. 
Vertical dashed line at Week 64 indicates transition from Q4W to Q2W 
Assessor’s comment 
In the Q2W arm, mean growth velocity was comparable during Week 0-64 and Week 112-160 (6.14 
cm/year and 6.12 cm/year, respectively versus 5.45 cm/year at baseline). During Week 64-112, on 
the other hand, mean growth velocity was lower (5.74 cm/year). It is difficult to find a reasonable 
explanation for this phenomenon. 
Of note, subjects in the Q4W treatment arm do not seem to catch up with the subjects in the Q2W arm 
in standing height even after transition to the Q2W dosing at Week 64. This supports the chosen 
posology Q2W. 
Walking Ability by 6MWT

Figure 11: 6MWT Distance Walked (m) (Mean ± SE) to Week 160 by Regimen (ITT 
Analysis Set) 
Assessor’s comment 
No further increase in 6MWT distance was seen between Week 88 (+65 m compared to baseline) and 
Week 160 (+57 m) in the Q2W treatment arm. This is notable. As the mean age increased by 72 
weeks, i.e. almost 1.5 years, between Week 88 and Week 160, a longer 6MWT distance at Week 160 
would have been expected.  
Functional Disability and Pain 
The POSNA-PODCI (Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection 
Instrument) questionnaire was used to measure the impact of bone and muscle conditions on daily 
activities and health-related quality of life. The following scales were administered in this study: Upper 
Extremity and Physical Function, Transfers and Basic Mobility, Sports/ Physical Functioning, 
Pain/Comfort, and Happiness. Scores from the first four scales, excluding the Happiness domain, are 
combined to derive a Global Functioning Scale score. Raw scores are scaled to set the mean of the 
normal population at 50 and one standard deviation in the normal population equal to 10. A score of 
40 is therefore considered at the lower boundary of the normal range for this instrument, and scores in 
the 30s and 20s imply a significant level of physical impairment and pain.

Assessor’s comment 
At the end of study, 73% of the subjects had experienced at least one related TEAE, compared to 69% 
at the time of the conditional marketing approval (CMA). No TEAE leading to death or discontinuation 
has been reported. The spectrum of adverse events is generally in line with previously reported 
adverse events with Crysvita.  
Of note, the frequency of headache events observed in this study (75%) is higher than published 
reviews of epidemiological studies on headache in children and adolescents, which have found a 
prevalence of headache in this population of approximately 54% to 58%.  
Among the related TEAEs, no new events of abnormalities in vitamin D or Calcium homeostasis were 
reported after the CMA of Crysvita.  
Serious Adverse Events 
One subject in the study UX023-CL201 experienced two concurrent serious TEAEs (pyrexia and 
myalgia) starting at Day 336, i.e. at approximately 48 weeks. Eosinophil percentage was 14.2% while 
other white cell differential parameters were in the normal range, which later normalized. The subject 
was negative for anti-KRN23 antibodies at all time points. No action was taken with KRN23 in response 
to the events, and study treatment was ongoing as of the data cut-off for this report, with no 
interruptions in the subsequent study dosing regimen. The SAEs were assessed as moderate in 
severity and deemed possibly related to KRN23.

Hypersensitivity 
Assessor’s comment 
After the conditional marketing approval (CMA) of Crysvita, an additional five subjects (in total 28 
subjects; 54%) have reported hypersensitivity adverse events at the end of study. None of the events 
were considered related to treatment.  
Hyperphosphataemia 
Assessor’s comment 
No TEAEs with the PT hyperphosphataemia were reported during the study, and no subject 
experienced serum phosphorus levels above the normal range at any time during the study.  
It should be noted that no postprandial phosphate samples were analysed.  
Ectopic Mineralization 
One subject experienced an adverse event of ectopic mineralization (moderate nephrocalcinosis), 
considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator, that was noted at the Week 40 Visit. 
The Week 88 and Week 112 renal ultrasound assessments demonstrated the absence of 
nephrocalcinosis. The event had resolved by the Week 136 Visit. Per the reporting investigator, the 
renal ultrasound report at Week 40 suggested a “beginning of nephrocalcinosis”; however, 
nephrocalcinosis scores per the central reading were 0 at Screening and at Weeks 16, 40, 64, 88, 112, 
136, 160, and EOS. Nephrolithiasis was observed at Week 112 but not at any other renal ultrasound 
assessment during the study 
The presence of nephrocalcinosis was evaluated based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 
(stone formation).

a Nephrocalcinosis was scored based on a 5-point scale 
One subject had a renal ultrasound nephrocalcinosis score of zero at Screening, a score of 1 from 
Week 16-112, and a score of 2 at Week 136-160. eGFR, iPTH, and serum calcium were normal, and 
24-hour urine calcium excretion rate was not increased, except at Week 160 (5 mg/kg/day [normal is 
< 4 mg/kg/day]).

Assessor’s comment 
The reported event of ectopic mineralisation was discussed in procedure EMEA/H/C/4275. As all central 
readings of ultrasound assessments were negative for nephrocalcinosis from baseline up to Week 88 in 
this subject, “beginning of nephrocalcinosis” at the clinical site's renal ultrasound report at Week 40 
was considered less probable. This is further supported by the report that the central readings were 0 
also at Weeks 112, 136, 160, and EOS. 
Nine subjects had increases of 1 point in renal ultrasound scores during the study and 3 subjects had 
decreases of 1 point. One subject had an increase in renal ultrasound score of 2 points from 0 to 2.  No 
reports of increases in renal ultrasound scores >1 point was presented at CMA. Ectopic mineralisation 
is listed as an important potential risk in the Crysvita RMP and labelled in section 4.4 of the Crysvita 
SmPC. This is considered adequate.  
Restless Legs Syndrome 
No TEAEs of restless legs syndrome were reported during the study 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Events 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were considered related to study drug by the investigator for 6 
subjects (12%). 
Dental Adverse Events 
Children with XLH may present with severe dental defects which typically manifest as spontaneous 
infections leading to dental abscesses. These infections are a result of defective dentin and enamel 
hypoplasia that diminishes the layer surrounding the pulp chamber, enabling oral bacteria to enter the 
pulp chamber and form abscesses. 
For the periods Week 0-64, Week 64-112, and Week 112-160, the overall exposure-adjusted incidence 
of dental TEAEs was 0.10, 0.09, and 0.03 events/year, respectively.  
The exposure-adjusted incidences in those periods were 0.06, 0.06, and 0.02 events/year, 
respectively, for toothache and 0.03, 0.03, and 0.01 events/year, respectively, for tooth abscess. 
Assessor’s comment 
The exposure-adjusted incidence for dental TEAEs including tooth abscesses were numerically 
somewhat lower during Week 112-160.

Assessor’s comment 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were noted in mean serum iPTH during the course of 
the study.  
One additional event of iPTH > 2XULN was reported in the study after the CMA. This event was 
reported at Week 208 and had improved at the EOS visit at Week 216.   
Vital signs 
One subject had a TEAE of mild irregular heart rate on Study Day 924 that was considered definitely 
not related to study drug and that resolved in 1 day. 
Assessor’s comment 
One additional TEAE, not considered related to the study drug, in the area of vital signs was reported 
in the study after the CMA  
ECG 
No subject had QTc intervals (with either Fridericia’s [QTcF] or Bazette’s [QTcB] corrections) of > 450 
ms. Nine subjects had QTc interval increases > 30 ms from Baseline (by either QTcF or QTcB or both). 
ECG assessments were normal at baseline and abnormal at Weeks 16, 40, 64, 88, 112, and 160 for 2 
(4%), 7 (14%), 3 (6%), 6 (12%), 2 (4%), and 1 (2%) subjects, respectively. Clinically insignificant 
sinus bradycardia was the most common abnormality noted. 
Assessor’s comment 
One additional subject (nine subjects in total) with QTc interval increases > 30 ms bit >60 ms from 
Baseline was reported in the study after the CMA. No subject had QTc intervals of > 450 ms. 
ECHO 
Ectopic mineralization (EM), as evaluated by ECHO, is a previously described qualitative 
echocardiographic index (Gaibazzi et al. 2015) of the possible extent of abnormal cardiac structural 
calcium or fibrotic deposition in tissue based on increased myocardial ultrasonic intensity (ie, 
brightness), which was graded from 0 (none) to 8 (marked). EM was Grade 0 for all 52 subjects at 
Baseline. EM was Grade 0 for all postbaseline assessments except for EM Grade 1 for 2 subjects at 
Week 88. Both subjects had EM Grade 0 at Weeks 112, 136, and 160 and at the EOS Visit. 
Overall cardiac function was assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The mean (SD) LVEF 
was within normal limits at Baseline (60% [6.1%]) and remained within normal limits at Week 16 
(62% [5.6%]), Week 40 (61% [5.7%]), Week 64 (62% [5.3%]), Week 88 (60% [5.2%]), Week 112 
(60% [5.1%]), and Week 160 (60% [4.3%]) 
Assessor’s comment 
Two subjects had signs of ectopic myocardial mineralisation grade 1/8 at Week 88. As all other ECHO 
assessments, both earlier and later, showed no ectopic myocardial mineralisation for both subjects, 
this is not considered of clinical relevance.

Anti-Burosumab Antibodies 
At Baseline, serum samples from 6 subjects (12%) tested positive for anti-burosumab antibodies; 2 
[8%] in the Q2W group and 4 [15%] in the Q4W→Q2W group. Two of these subjects (one in each 
treatment group) tested positive at every visit. 
Overall, 6 subjects (12%) who were negative at Baseline were positive at any post-baseline visit, and 
2 subjects (4%) who were positive at Baseline were negative at any post-baseline visit.  
Three subjects (6%) were positive for neutralizing anti-burosumab antibodies. 
The baseline reactivities most likely reflect the presence of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. 
Weak reactivities due to cross-reactive antibodies are sometimes detected, particularly with high 
sensitivity assays that use a low starting dilution such as 1:2. Furthermore, the assay cut point was set 
conservatively such that there should be approximately 5% false positive results. 
Because only one of the 6 subjects with reactivity with burosumab at Baseline showed a minimal 
increase in reactivity after exposure to the product, it is unlikely that these represent true anti-drug 
antibodies. 
Assessor’s comment 
Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies were present in six subjects at baseline. Three subjects 
developed neutralising anti-burosumab antibodies during the study. For one subject, presence of 
neutralising anti-burosumab antibodies was detected more consistently after Week 88 (Weeks 88, 136, 
160 and EOS). This subject received 1.5 mg/kg burosumab from Week 54 to EOS and serum 
phosphate levels were constant varying from 3.3 to 4 mg/dL during this time period.  
The risk of developing neutralising anti-burosumab antibodies is known. So far, no case with clear 
evidence of lack of efficacy due to anti-Burosumab antibodies has been reported.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a hereditary disease characterized by high levels of circulating 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lead to excessive urinary phosphate excretion and subsequent 
hypophosphataemia.  
Crysvita is a fully human monoclonal antibody designed to bind and thereby inhibit the excessive 
biologic activity of FGF23. In 2018, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing 
authorization (CMA) for Crysvita for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia with radiographic 
evidence of bone disease in children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons.  
The benefits and risks of burosumab in children with XLH were demonstrated in the original MAA based 
on the ongoing single-arm studies UX023-CL201 and UX023-CL205. As special obligations for a full 
approval, the MAH committed to complete these studies, as well as the ongoing confirmatory phase 3 
Study UX023-CL301. Week 64 data from study UX023-CL301 is currently under assessment in 
variation (EMEA/H/C/4275/II/04). 
The current procedure regards the final report for study UX023-CL201. UX023-CL201 was a 
randomized, multicentre, open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 study assessed the PD, efficacy, and safety 
of burosumab in prepubescent children (5 to 12 years old) with XLH.

The study consisted of a 64 week long primary assessment period comparing burosumab dosing every 
second (Q2W) to dosing every fourth week (Q4W). This was followed by Treatment Extension Period I 
(Weeks 64 to 160), during which all subjects received burosumab Q2W, aiming to evaluate the long-
term safety and efficacy of burosumab. Subjects could choose to end participation in the study at 
Week 160. For subjects who chose to continue after Week 160, the study also included a Treatment 
Extension Period II (up to 56 weeks) to provide burosumab treatment to study subjects until the 
availability of the product. Efficacy data are provided to Week 160.  
Methodology and data up to Week 64 were thoroughly assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/4275 at the 
original marketing approval for Crysvita and are therefore not repeated here.  
The mean burosumab dose per administration was essentially unchanged from Week 64 (1.05 mg/kg 
for the Q2W group and 1.01 mg/kg for the Q4W group) to Week 190 (1.07 mg/kg). 
One hallmark of XLH is low serum phosphate levels due to impaired renal phosphate reabsorption. The 
beneficial effect of burosumab given Q2W on these pharmacodynamic parameters were maintained 
from Week 64 to Week 160. P1NP, a marker of bone formation, and CTx, a marker of bone resorption, 
increased during the study. This is considered to reflect improved bone turnover, which is impaired in 
XLH. The increase in bone turnover markers was maintained from Week 64. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in the Thacher Rickets Severity Score (RSS). 
Efficacy as determined by RSS was maintained to Week 160, even though the percent change from 
baseline in the Q2W group was lower at Week 88 and Week 160 compared to Week 40 (-55%, -54% 
and -61%, respectively). Seven subjects in the Q2W arm were excluded from the Week 160 analysis 
due to fused or partially fused growth plates.  
RSS responder rate was a secondary efficacy endpoint in the study. After Week 64, the RSS responder 
rate gradually decreased in the Q2W population. A similar development was not seen in the Q4W arm, 
presumably due to the dose increase to Q2W at Week 64.  
In the Q2W arm, responder rate was 80% (16/20) at Week 64, 70% (14/20) at Week 88 and 57% 
(8/14) (40% [8/20] if adhering to the true ITT population) at Week 160. The population at Week 88 
differs slightly from the population at Week 160 as six subjects were excluded from the Week 160 
analysis due to fused or partially fused growth plates. 
Efficacy of burosumab was also assessed by RGI-C (Radiographic Global Impression of Change) which 
utilises a 7-point ordinal scale to evaluate the extent of healing in a radiograph as compared with a 
radiograph taken at a prior time point. The validity of the RGI-C scoring was thoroughly discussed in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/4275 at the original marketing approval for Crysvita. Efficacy as determined by 
RGI-C was maintained to Week 160. 
Clinical parameters of relevance include growth, 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and subjective 
scorings.  
In the Q2W arm, mean growth velocity was comparable during Week 0-64 and Week 112-160 (6.14 
cm/year and 6.12 cm/year, respectively versus 5.45 cm/year at baseline). During Week 64-112, on 
the other hand, mean growth velocity was lower (5.74 cm/year). It is difficult to find a reasonable 
explanation for this phenomenon. 
Of note, subjects in the Q4W treatment arm do not seem to catch up with the subjects in the Q2W arm 
in standing height even after transition to the Q2W dosing at Week 64. This supports the chosen 
posology Q2W.

No further increase in 6MWT distance was seen between Week 88 (+65 m compared to baseline) and 
Week 160 (+57 m) in the Q2W treatment arm. This is notable. As the mean age per definition increase 
by 72 weeks, i.e. almost 1.5 years, between Week 88 and Week 160, a longer 6MWT distance at Week 
160 would have been expected. 
The self-assessment of Functional Disability and Pain according to the POSNA-PODCI scales showed 
sustained improvement on the Sports/ Physical Functioning, Pain/Comfort, Happiness and global scales 
up to Week 160.  
The spectrum of adverse events reported during the open-label period was in line with previously 
reported. No new serious adverse event was reported after the CMA of Crysvita. Of note, the frequency 
of headache events observed in this study (75%) is higher than published reviews of epidemiological 
studies on headache in children and adolescents, which have found a prevalence of headache in this 
population of approximately 54% to 58%. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) include injection site reactions, hyperphosphataemia, ectopic 
mineralization, dental adverse events and hypersensitivity. These events are all labelled in section 4.4 
and/or 4.8 of the Crysvita. No unexpected findings were reported in these areas during the open-label 
period of the study.  
Currently only study results for up to the 64 weeks are described within the SmPC. Section 4.8 and 
section 5.1 should be updated with data from Study UX023-CL201. 
Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies were present in six subjects at baseline. Three subjects 
developed neutralising anti-burosumab antibodies during the study. For one subject, presence of 
neutralising anti-burosumab antibodies was detected more consistently after Week 88 (Weeks 88, 136, 
160 and EOS). This subject received 1.5 mg/kg burosumab from Week 54 to EOS and serum 
phosphate levels were constant varying from 3.3 to 4 mg/dL during this time period.  
The risk of developing neutralising anti-burosumab antibodies is known. So far, no case with clear 
evidence of lack of efficacy due to anti-Burosumab antibodies has been reported.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
No new and unexpected safety findings were reported during long-term treatment with Crysvita up to 
a maximum of 214 weeks. The beneficial effects of Crysvita were maintained during the open-label 
extension period. The benefit/risk ratio of Crysvita is considered unchanged.  
The final report of Study UX023-CL201 fulfils Special obligation number 1 for Crysvita. 
The MAH does not propose any updates to the Product information at this time point. This is not fully 
agreed, as Annex II of the Product information needs to be varied to reflect the fact that Special 
obligation number 1 is considered fulfilled. An appropriate variation should be submitted accordingly.  
Furthermore, the long-term data from study UX023-CL201 should be added to section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. Likewise, section 4.8 should be amended reflecting new frequencies of adverse events based on 
this study. However, if the MAH prefers to await the results from the two studies comprising the 
additional Special obligations and update section 4.8 and 5.1 with results from all three studies at the 
same time, this is considered acceptable.

  Fulfilled: 
No further action required. However, as the Special obligation number 1 is considered fulfilled, this 
condition should be removed from Annex II in the Product information. A variation should be 
submitted. The RMP should be updated accordingly at the next procedure involving the RMP. 
Amendment of sections 4.8 and 5.1 with results from study UX023-CL201 could be done in a later 
Type II variation when results from the two studies comprising the additional Special obligations are 
present, if the MAH prefers that.

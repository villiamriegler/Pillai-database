To update sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on an interaction with the selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in section 4.5 
and consequential information concerning this 
interaction in section 4.4. The Package leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. 
To update 4.8 of the SmPC to add "Rash exfoliative" 
as a new undesirable effect. 
Furthermore minor editorial correction to DE, HR, NO 
and PL text were introduced. These changes have 
been previously approved for the reference medicinal 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. No literature 
review on the efficacy/effectiveness has been submitted by 
the MAH within this application. Since the clinical efficacy of 
clopidogrel in the approved indications is well established 
and evidence of clinical efficacy has been discussed at time 
of approval the CHMP finds acceptable the MAH approach of 
not performing a literature review on the 
efficacy/effectiveness of clopidogrel. 
The beneficial effect of Zyllt remains in line with that of the 
originator product (Plavix), and is considered positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommended that the Marketing 
Authorisation for Zyllt can be renewed with unlimited 
validity.

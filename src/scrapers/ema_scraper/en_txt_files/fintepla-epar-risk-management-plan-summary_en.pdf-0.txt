PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Fintepla (fenfluramine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Fintepla. The RMP details important 
risks of Fintepla, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Fintepla's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Fintepla's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Fintepla should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Fintepla should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Fintepla's 
RMP.

THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Fintepla is authorised for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add-on 
therapy to other antiepileptic medicines for patients 2 years-of-age and older (see SmPC for the 
full indication). Additionally, fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated 
with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome as an add-on therapy to other antiepileptic medicines in patients 
2 years of age and older. It contains fenfluramine as the active substance and it is given by 
mouth. 
Further information about the evaluation of Fintepla’s benefits can be found in Fintepla’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/fintepla.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important  risks  of  Fintepla,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Fintepla's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Fintepla, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety updated report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Fintepla is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Fintepla are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Fintepla. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Based on historical experience with fenfluramine use in obese adults, in which 
PAH was reported. 
Patients with pulmonary hypertension. 
Diseases associated with an increased risk of PAH include connective tissue 
disorders, cirrhosis of the liver, HIV infection, schistosomiasis, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, left heart disease 
including congestive heart failure, and congenital heart diseases (atrial septal 
defect, ventricular septal defect). 
Several factors may be responsible for the disease; these include stimulation of 
5-HT1B, 5-HT2B or 5-HT2A receptors, nitric oxide deficiency, estrogen, and 
mutations in the BMPR2 gene.

Important potential risk: Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Based on data from studies showing that epilepsy increases the risk for suicidal 
thoughts and ideation, and AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts in 
people with epilepsy. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Psychiatric illness is one of the risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior in 
the general population. The risk and benefit of treatment with fenfluramine 
should be carefully weighed for patients with a history of depression and/or 
suicidal ideation or behavior.

Postauthorization development plan 
Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorisation: 
•  A Registry of Subjects Treated with Fenfluramine 
Purpose of the study: This observational registry will provide data to further assess the 
long-term safety of fenfluramine as prescribed in routine practice, with a focus on characterising 
and quantifying the important potential risks of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. In addition, the registry will provide data to characterise and quantify the 
important potential risk of growth retardation. Moreover, the data collected on the frequency of 
echocardiographic monitoring will also contribute to assess the effectiveness of risk 
minimisation measures. 
2.3.2 
Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
•  Study ZX008-1503: An Open-Label Extension Trial to Assess the Long-Term Safety of 
ZX008 (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) Oral Solution as an Adjunctive Therapy in 
Children and Young Adults with Dravet Syndrome. 
Purpose of the study: This study will provide data to further assess the long-term safety of 
fenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome, with a focus on characterising decreased weight, 
VHD, PAH, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. 
•  A drug utilisation study of fenfluramine in Europe. 
Purpose of the study: This observational study will provide data to further characterise the use 
of fenfluramine in routine practice, with a focus on potential off-label use in children younger 
than 2 years, in other rare paediatric epilepsies and for weight management. Data on the extent 
and frequency echocardiographic monitoring will also contribute to assess the effectiveness of 
risk minimisation measures. 
•  A European Study of the Effectiveness of Risk Minimisation Measures for 
Fenfluramine in Dravet Syndrome. 
Purpose of the study: This observational study will assess the effect of these additional risk 
minimisation measures by describing the awareness, knowledge, and compliance of fenfluramine 
prescribers to the physician specific educational, as well as the distribution of the patient/carer 
educational material by the physicians.
